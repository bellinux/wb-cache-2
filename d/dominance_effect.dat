50|$|When forming {{academic}} self-concept (ASC) does classroom friend achievement {{or class}} achievement {{have a larger}} effect? One hypothesis suggests that friend average achievement has the larger effect. This {{is known as the}} friend dominance hypothesis and is consistent with the local <b>dominance</b> <b>effect</b> model. The local <b>dominance</b> <b>effect</b> model posits that people tend to rely on the most local comparison source when there are multiple comparison sources available. Friends are considered a more local source for comparison than classmates, so this would imply that friends should have a larger effect on ASC than classmates. An alternative hypothesis suggests that class-average achievement has a larger effect on ASC than friend-average achievement. Several studies support this hypothesis. The first showed that individuals showed stronger assimilation effects toward their comparison target when {{they were part of a}} group or when they focused on emotional bonding. Huguet et al. (2009) supported the idea that friends may induce smaller contrast effects than classmates in addition to inducing larger assimilation effects than classmates. The hypothesis that class-average achievement has the larger effect has garnered the most support. Wouters, Colpin, Van Damme, De Laet, and Verschueren (2013) compared the effects of friend-average achievement and class-average achievement on global academic, math, and language self-concept. The study found that the negative effect of class-average achievement was always greater than the negative effect of friend-average achievement. In some cases, the effect of friend average achievement was not even statistically significant. These findings do not support the local <b>dominance</b> <b>effect</b> model.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{analysis}} of genetic correlations between fiber length (Len), strength (Str), micronaire, and 12 other traits was conducted using the additive (A) -dominance (D) genetic model, which considers genotype 9 environment interaction effects, in intra-specific upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) hybrids to effectively {{improve the quality}} of cotton cultivars in high planting density cases. Decision-making coefficients were computed based on the genetic correlation and path {{analysis of}} three fiber quality traits. The decision-making coefficient analy-sis of three fiber traits in cross breeding was beneficial for the improvement of Len by increasing the additive effects of Str and length of boll (LB) and decreasing lint percentage (LP), boll number of the top three fruit-bearing branches. The analysis was also beneficial for the improvement of Str and fiber fineness by increasing or decreasing the additive effects of other traits. Utilizing heterosis in hybrids was beneficial to the heterosis of Len by selecting the high <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> of number of nodes of the 1 st fruit-bearing branch and LB and decreasing the <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> of diameter of boll (DB) and LP and for improving Str by increasing the <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> of DB and decreasing the <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> of number of fruit-bearing branches and number of nodes of the main stem (NNMS).

5000|$|In 1974, Francis B. Colavita {{conducted}} an experiment, which provided evidence for visual dominance in humans when performing an audiovisual discrimination task. In his seminal experiment, Colavita (1974) presented participants with an auditory (tone) or visual (light) stimulus, {{to which they}} were instructed to respond by pressing the ‘tone key’ or ‘light key’ respectively. Throughout the experiment, unimodal auditory trials, unimodal visual trials and a small number of audiovisual bimodal trials were randomly presented. Colavita deceived the participants by informing them that the bimodal trials in the experiment occurred “accidentally”. During practice trials, Colavita would “accidentally” present audiovisual stimuli, and would then draw the participants’ attention to what had just happened and would apologize for such ‘accident’. In addition, the participants were not instructed on how to respond on such trials or whether this type of trials would occur again [...] The results showed that participants had almost equivalent response times for auditory and visual stimuli in unimodal trials. Additionally, Colavita found that participants pressed the ‘light key’ in the majority of the bimodal trials. This was seen as evidence of visual dominance because participants failed to acknowledge the presence of the auditory stimulus in most bimodal trials. However, due to Colavita’s deception of the “accidental” occurrence of bimodal trials, researchers have proposed that experimenter expectancy effects, task demands or methodological problems {{may have contributed to the}} visual <b>dominance</b> <b>effect</b> reported in Colavita’s original study. Nevertheless, subsequent experiments have discontinued the use of deception, and continue to show a robust Colavita visual <b>dominance</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

50|$|In marketing, the decoy effect (or {{asymmetric}} <b>dominance</b> <b>effect)</b> is {{the phenomenon}} whereby consumers {{will tend to}} have a specific change in preference between two options when also presented with a third option that is asymmetrically dominated. An option is asymmetrically dominated when it is inferior in all respects to one option; but, in comparison to the other option, it is inferior in some respects and superior in others. In other words, in terms of specific attributes determining preferability, it is completely dominated by (i.e., inferior to) one option and only partially dominated by the other. When the asymmetrically dominated option is present, a higher percentage of consumers will prefer the dominating option than when the asymmetrically dominated option is absent. The asymmetrically dominated option is therefore a decoy serving to increase preference for the dominating option. The decoy effect is also an example of the violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives axiom of decision theory.|$|E
50|$|Two genetic {{assumptions}} used in ICIM are (1) the genotypic {{value of}} an individual is the summation of effects from all genes affecting the trait of interest; and (2) linked QTL are separated {{by at least one}} blank marker interval. Under the two assumptions, they proved that additive effect of the QTL located in a marker interval can be completely absorbed by the regression coefficients of the two flanking markers, while the QTL <b>dominance</b> <b>effect</b> causes marker dominance effects, as well as additive by additive and dominance by dominance interactions between the two flanking markers. By including two multiplication variables between flanking markers, the additive and dominance effects of one QTL can be completely absorbed. As a consequence, an inclusive linear model of phenotype regressing on all genetic markers (and marker multiplications) can be used to fit the positions, and additive (and dominance) effects of all QTL in the genome. A two-step strategy was adopted in ICIM for additive and dominance QTL mapping. In the first step, stepwise regression was applied to identify the most significant marker variables in the linear model. In the second step, one-dimensional scanning or interval mapping was conducted for detecting QTL and estimating its additive and dominance effects, based on the phenotypic values adjusted by the regression model in the first step.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackground <b>Dominance</b> <b>effects</b> may {{contribute}} to genetic variation of complex traits in dairy cattle, especially for traits closely related to fitness such as fertility. However, traditional genetic evaluations generally ignore <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> and consider additive genetic effects only. Availability of dense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) panels provides the opportunity to investigate the role of dominance in quantitative variation of complex traits at both the SNP and animal levels. Including <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> in the genomic evaluation of animals could also help to increase the accuracy of prediction of future phenotypes. In this study, we estimated additive and dominance variance components for fertility and milk production traits of genotyped Holstein and Jersey cows in Australia. The predictive abilities of a model that accounts for additive effects only (additive), and a model that accounts for both additive and <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> (additive + dominance) were compared in a fivefold cross-validation. ResultsEstimates of the proportion of dominance variation relative to phenotypic variation that is captured by SNPs, for production traits, were up to 3. 8 and 7. 1  % in Holstein and Jersey cows, respectively, whereas, for fertility, they were equal to 1. 2  % in Holstein and very close to zero in Jersey cows. We found that including dominance in the model was not consistently advantageous. Based on maximum likelihood ratio tests, the additive + dominance model fitted the data better than the additive model, for milk, fat and protein yields in both breeds. However, regarding the prediction of phenotypes assessed with fivefold cross-validation, including <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> in the model improved accuracy only for fat yield in Holstein cows. Regression coefficients of phenotypes on genetic values and mean squared errors of predictions showed that the predictive ability of the additive + dominance model was superior {{to that of the}} additive model for some of the traits. ConclusionsIn both breeds, <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> were significant (P <  0. 01) for all milk production traits but not for fertility. Accuracy of prediction of phenotypes was slightly increased by including <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> in the genomic evaluation model.

5000|$|In diploid organisms, {{the average}} {{genotypic}} [...] "value" [...] (locus value) {{may be defined}} by the allele [...] "effect" [...] together with a <b>dominance</b> <b>effect,</b> and also by how genes interact with genes at other loci (epistasis). The founder of quantitative genetics - Sir Ronald Fisher - perceived much of this when he proposed the first mathematics of this branch of genetics. [...] Being a statistician, he defined the gene effects as deviations from a central value—enabling the use of statistical concepts such as mean and variance, which use this idea. The central value he chose for the gene was the midpoint between the two opposing homozygotes at the one locus. The deviation {{from there to the}} [...] "greater" [...] homozygous genotype can be named [...] "+a" [...] and therefore it is [...] "-a" [...] from that same midpoint to the [...] "lesser" [...] homozygote genotype.

5000|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that people with one eye have enhanced spatial vision, implying that vision in the remaining working eye compensates for the loss of the simultaneous use of both eyes. Furthermore, individuals who have lost the ability to use one sensory system develop an enhanced ability {{in the use of the}} remaining senses. It is thought that intact sensory systems may adapt and compensate for the loss of one of the senses. However, little is known about cross-sensory adaption in cases of developmental partial sensory deprivation, such as monocular enucleation, where individuals have one eye surgically removed early in life. In an experiment, Moro and Steeves tested whether participants with one eye showed the Colavita visual <b>dominance</b> <b>effect,</b> and compared their performance to binocular viewers (use of both eyes) and monocular (eye-patched) control participants. In their experiment, Moro and Steeves used a stimulus detection and discrimination task, which had three conditions: unimodal visual targets, unimodal auditory targets, and bimodal (visual and auditory presented together) targets. The binocular and monocular participants both displayed the Colavita visual dominance effect; however the monocular enucleation group did not. Moro and Steeves demonstrated that people with one eye show equivalent auditory and visual processing, compared with binocular and monocular viewing controls, when asked to discriminate between audio, visual, and bimodal stimuli.|$|E

Interactant variables are the traits of those persons involved in the communication, such as sex, attractiveness, race, culture, status, and age. Environmental variables include the amount of space available and the nature of the territory surrounding the interaction. Interaction variables include social norms, purpose of the interaction, and formality of the situation. [...] These factors later evolved into communicator characteristics, relational characteristics, and context. [...] Communicator characteristics include personal features such as an individual's appearance, personality and communication style. It also includes factors such as age, sex and ethnic background. Relational characteristics refer to factors such as similarity, familiarity, status and liking. The type of relationship one individual shares within another (e.g. romantic, business or platonic), the previous experiences shared between the individuals, and how close they are with one another are also relational characteristics that influence expectations. Context encompasses both environment and interaction characteristics. [...] Communicator characteristics lead to distinctions between males and females in assessing the extent to which their nonverbal expressions of power and <b>dominance</b> <b>effect</b> immediacy behaviors.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a {{flexible}} model for analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in outbred line crosses, which includes both additive and <b>dominance</b> <b>effects.</b> Our flexible intercross analysis (FIA) model accounts for QTL that are not fixed within founder lines and is based on the variance component framework. Genome scans with FIA are performed using a score statistic, which does not require variance component estimation. Results Simulations of a pedigree with 800 F 2 individuals showed that the power of FIA including both additive and <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> was almost 50 % for a QTL with equal allele frequencies in both lines with complete dominance and a moderate effect, whereas the power of a traditional regression model was equal to the chosen significance value of 5 %. The power of FIA without <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> included in the model was close to those obtained for FIA with dominance for all simulated cases except for QTL with overdominant effects. A genome-wide linkage analysis of experimental data from an F 2 intercross between Red Jungle Fowl and White Leghorn was performed with both additive and <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> included in FIA. The score values for chicken body weight at 200 days of age were similar to those obtained in FIA analysis without dominance. Conclusion We have extended FIA to include QTL <b>dominance</b> <b>effects.</b> The power of FIA was superior, or similar, to standard regression methods for QTL <b>effects</b> with <b>dominance.</b> The difference in power for FIA with or without dominance is expected to be small as long as the QTL effects are not overdominant.

5000|$|In chapter 1, Ariely {{describes}} {{the ways in}} which people frequently regard their environment in terms of their relation to others; it is the way that the human brain is wired. People not only compare things, but also compare things that are easily comparable. For example, if given the following options for a honeymoon - Paris (with free breakfast), Rome (with free breakfast), and Rome (no breakfast included), most people would probably choose Rome with the free breakfast. The rationale is that it is easier to compare the two options for Rome than it is to compare Paris and Rome. Ariely also explains the role of the decoy effect (or asymmetric <b>dominance</b> <b>effect)</b> in the decision process. The decoy effect is the phenomenon whereby consumers will tend to have a specific change in preference between two options when also presented with a third option that is asymmetrically dominated. This effect is the [...] "secret agent" [...] in many decisions. In the example with the honeymoon options, Rome without free breakfast is the decoy. (It makes Rome with breakfast look superior to Rome without breakfast. Comparing Rome and Paris is difficult, so the easy comparison of Rome makes it more likely to choose Rome over Paris.) It makes Paris look inferior when compared to Rome with the free breakfast. Relativity helps people make decisions but it can also make them miserable. People compare their lives to those of others, leading to jealousy and inferiority. Ariely finishes the chapter by saying [...] "the more we have, the more we want" [...] and his suggested cure is to break the cycle of relativity. To break the cycle, people can control what goes on around them. The focus on smaller [...] "circles" [...] can boost relative happiness, as can changing this focus from narrow to broad.

In this study, we investigate the effect that threat has upon this phenomenon, known as the Colavita visual <b>dominance</b> <b>effect.</b> Participants performed two blocks of trials containing 40 % visual, 40 % auditory, and 20 % bimodal trials. The first block of trials was identical for all participants, while in the second block, either the visual stimulus (visual threat condition), auditory stimulus (auditory threat condition), or neither stimulus (control condition) was fear-conditioned using aversive electrocutaneous stimuli. We predicted that, when compared with the control condition, this visual <b>dominance</b> <b>effect</b> would increase in the visual threat condition and decrease in the auditory threat condition. This hypothesis was partially supported by the data. In particular, the results showed that the fear-conditioning of the visual stimulus significantly increased the visual <b>dominance</b> <b>effect</b> relative to the control condition. However, the fear-conditioning of the auditory stimulus did not reduce the visual <b>dominance</b> <b>effect</b> but instead increased it slightly. These findings are discussed in terms of the role that attention and arousal play in the dominance of vision over audition...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} <b>dominance</b> <b>effect</b> in relative clause descriptions of concept conjunctions such as peer {{that are also}} birds. It was shown that the <b>dominance</b> <b>effect</b> is a general phenomenon, {{both in terms of}} combined concepts (with 2 / 3 of the 50 conjunctions studied showing the effect) and in terms of different tasks (membership ratings, exemplar generation, and category naming). A considerable amount of the effect could be accounted for by an unweighted sum of the membership ratings for the 2 constituents. The part of the <b>dominance</b> <b>effect</b> that could not be explained by an unweighted sum was best predicted by exemplar-based pairwise differentiation between the 2 constituents, meaning that dominance partly depends on an interactional process. The pairwise differentiation was shown to be interpretable as proportional overlap of the extension: The constituent for which it was hardest to think of exemplars outside the conjunction dominated. Finally, 2 theories were discussed that can explain the results. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} 21060 {{kindling}} records (collected between 1992 and 2016) of 4926 Pannon White (PW) does inseminated with 1414 PW mating bucks were analysed. Genetic components and genetic trends {{for the number}} of kits born alive (NBA), number of kits born dead (NBD) and the total number of born kits (TNB) were estimated using the four single trait animal models. Heritability estimates were low for all traits. For NBA and TNB they ranged between 0. 06 - 0. 07 ± 0. 01. For NBD they were close to zero (0. 019 - 0. 020 ± 0. 004). Th e ratios of the permanent environmental to the phenotypic variances ranged between 0. 07 - 0. 1 ± 0. 01 for NBA, 0. 009 - 0. 013 ± 0. 004 for NBD and 0. 07 - 0. 10 ± 0. 01 for TNB. Analysing the models’ fi t showed that bias values were practically zero for all traits and models. After selecting the best fitted model (containing parity, age of the doe and year-month of kindling) it was extended with <b>dominance</b> <b>effects.</b> As a result, heritability estimates decreased to 0. 06 ± 0. 01 for NBA, 0. 02 ± 0. 01 for NBD and 0. 06 ± 0. 01 for TNB. Th e ratio of the permanent environmental effects to the phenotypic variances also decreased to 0. 08 ± 0. 01 for NBA, 0. 008 ± 0. 005 for NBD and 0. 08 ± 0. 001 for TNB. Ratios of the <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> were larger than those of the heritability estimates for NBA (0. 09 ± 0. 01) and TNB (0. 08 ± 0. 01). On the contrary for NBD ratio of the <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> was smaller than the heritability estimates (0. 01 ± 0. 002). Confounding was found among additive genetic, permanent environmental and <b>dominance</b> <b>effects.</b> Inclusion of <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> also reduced genetics trends (0. 027 vs 0. 026, 0. 0003 vs - 0. 0004 and 0. 0258 vs 0. 0255 for NBA, NBD and TNB, respectively). Spearman rank correlation coefficients between breeding values of the additive and dominance models were high for all traits (0. 99). However, some re-ranking was observed among the top ranked animals for all litter size traits...|$|R
40|$|Knowing the {{inheritance}} of traits {{is essential to}} establish selection strategies in breeding programs. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the genetic control of traits related to the phosphorus use efficiency in maize. A total of 280 progenies were developed according to design III, which were evaluated in the field under high and low phosphorus (P) availability. The genetic variance components were estimated for the agronomic traits and indices that define P use efficiency. The results indicated that the additive and <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> were important in explaining the genetic variability for the flowering time, grain yield and P efficiency indices. However, <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> prevailed, indicating that breeding efforts should be made to develop hybrids exploiting the heterosis for traits related to P use efficiency. 201...|$|R
40|$|New {{proposals}} for models and applications of prediction processes with data on molecular markers may {{help reduce the}} financial costs of and identify superior genotypes in maize breeding programs. Studies evaluating Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP) models including <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> have not been performed in the univariate and multivariate context in the data analysis of this crop. A single cross hybrid construction procedure was performed in this study using phenotypic data and actual molecular markers of 4, 091 maize lines from the public database Panzea. A total of 400 simple hybrids resulting from this process were analyzed using the univariate and multivariate GBLUP model considering only additive <b>effects</b> additive plus <b>dominance</b> <b>effects.</b> Historic heritability scenarios of five traits and other genetic architecture settings were used to compare models, evaluating the predictive ability and estimation of variance components. Marginal differences were detected between the multivariate and univariate models. The main explanation for the small discrepancy between models is the low- to moderate-magnitude correlations between the traits studied and moderate heritabilities. These conditions do not favor the advantages of multivariate analysis. The inclusion of <b>dominance</b> <b>effects</b> in the models was an efficient strategy to improve the predictive ability and estimation quality of variance components...|$|R
