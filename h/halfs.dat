He tells the two women that he would keep {{whichever}} of them that brews the better ale for him by the time he has returned home in the summer. The two compete and during the brewing process Signy prays to Freyja and Geirhild to Hött ("hood"), a man she had met earlier (earlier in the saga revealed to be Odin in disguise). Hött answers her prayer and spits on her yeast. Signy's brew wins the contest.|$|E
25|$|The Seahawks {{began their}} postseason run by {{traveling}} to Minneapolis {{to face the}} Vikings in the wild card round, {{in one of the}} coldest games in NFL history, as the temperature on the field at game time was -6° F. Minnesota held the Seahawks scoreless until the fourth quarter, but could not reach the end zone themselves and had to settle for field goals the whole game. The Seahawks managed to score a touchdown and a field goal deep in the fourth quarter to take a 10-9 lead, but the Vikings seemed poised to score a fourth field goal and win until Vikings kicker Blair Walsh missed a 27-yard chip shot, allowing the Seahawks to escape with the victory. However, the Seahawks' luck would run out in the Divisional round, against the #1 seed Carolina Panthers. In one of the most disastrous first <b>halfs</b> in team history, the Panthers ran the Seahawks off the field to the tune of a 31-0 halftime lead. The Seahawks would make it a game in the second half, bringing the score {{all the way back to}} 31-24, but would fail to recover an onside kick in the final two minutes of play to seal their fate.|$|E
2500|$|Three-edged ingots is a {{rare and}} late sub-type of Lithuanian longs. They are found full or cut in half (<b>halfs</b> are also known as poltina). As of 1981, they were found in seven {{locations}} in a triangle between Kaunas, Vilnius, and Alytus and in Kretinga. In total, 38 ingots were found – 5 full and 33 cut in half. In 2002, half of a three-edged ingot {{was found in the}} Lower Castle of Vilnius. In 2010, 52 full and 4 half ingots were found in Grigaičiai near Naujoji Vilnia. In 2004 and 2007, the Money Museum of the Bank of Lithuania acquired two <b>halfs</b> of three-edged ingots (circumstances of their discovery are not known). One of them is particularly interesting as it is countermarked with {{what appears to be a}} crown inside a circular rope border. In 2002 and 2003, the first three-edged ingots were found outside of Lithuania: 9 <b>halfs</b> in Palačany (Палачаны) and 10 <b>halfs</b> plus 1 full bar in Litva (Літва) villages in Maladzyechna Raion, Belarus.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Mint {{was criticized}} for {{commemorative}} issues of dubious recognition and seemingly endless mint runs. As {{an example of the}} latter, the Oregon Trail Memorial 50-cent piece was minted 8 years during a 14-year span. Multiple unrelated commemoratives also were minted in many years, diminishing the significance of commemorative issues. In 1936 alone the following 19 commemorative <b>half</b> dollars were minted: Oregon Trail Memorial, Texas Centennial <b>half</b> dollar, Daniel Boone Bicentennial <b>half</b> dollar, Arkansas Centennial <b>half</b> dollar, San Diego California Pacific Exposition, Rhode Island Tercentenary <b>half</b> dollar, Cleveland/Great Lakes Exposition, Wisconsin Territorial Centennial <b>half</b> dollar, Cincinnati Music Center <b>half</b> dollar, Long Island Tercentenary <b>half</b> dollar, Bridgeport, Connecticut Centennial <b>half</b> dollar, Lynchburg, Virginia Sesquicentennial <b>half</b> dollar, Elgin Centennial <b>half</b> dollar, Albany Charter <b>half</b> dollar, San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge <b>half</b> dollar, Columbia, South Carolina Sesquicentennial <b>half</b> dollar, Delaware Tercentenary <b>half</b> dollar, Battle of Gettysburg <b>half</b> dollar, and Norfolk, Virginia Bicentennial <b>half</b> dollar. A half-dollar commemorative coin of the sesquicentennial anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase was proposed in 1952, but ultimately failed to go into mint and the period of Early Commemoratives soon after ended with the 1954 issues of the Washington–Carver 50-cent piece.|$|R
2500|$|The tree-edged ingots {{are most}} often found {{together}} with earliest coins minted in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and with Prague groschens – coins that circulated in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. Chemical analysis of three such ingots revealed that they were of very high quality (silver content between 97.4% and 98.9% with traces of gold and copper). The Money Museum analyzed the two <b>halfs</b> in its possession and found 91.5% and 97.7% silver content. A 2010 analysis of a half ingot kept in a local museum in Kernavė revealed silver content of 97.05–97.11%. Researchers proposed that three-edged ingots appeared {{as a result of}} a monetary reform in response to the declining quality of semicircular ingots. Also, it is likely that the weight was adjusted to match Prague groschens: 50 groschens weighted about [...]|$|E
2500|$|While in prison, Evans and Cheevers {{produced}} multiple {{letters and}} a narrative published {{under the name}} This is a Short Relation {{of some of the}} Cruel Sufferings (for the Truths Sake) of Katharine Evans & Sarah Cheevers in the Inquisition in the Isle of Malta in 1662. In 1663, Evans and Cheevers also published A True Account of the Great Tryals and Cruel Sufferings Undergone by Those Two Faithful Servants of God, Katherine Evans and Sarah Cheevers, in the Time of Their above Three Years and a <b>Halfs</b> Confinement in the Island Malta which included a narrative of their release and their journey home. These publications largely provide an account of their experiences, including recountings of inquisitions, visions/prophecies, treatment, and illnesses. They include letters to friends, family, and church members that discuss religion and faith in depth. While recounting the narrative, both Evans and Cheevers use language and a writing style that historians attribute to the women's desire to draw biblical comparisons and paint themselves as victims or martyrs. They also include extended discussions of their [...] ideals, involving a core belief in salvation through the personal belief in God, and accounts of their “revelations and visions,” one of which is a world-ending war against Catholicism. These works were received well in England by early Quaker audiences and were printed in multiple editions, with few edits made.|$|E

In the {{eleventh}} Figure, MN represents the Window, and DE the Paper terminated with parallel Sides DJ and HE, {{and by the}} transverse Line FG distinguished into two <b>halfs,</b> the one DG of an intensely blue Colour, the other FE of an intensely red. And BACcab represents the Prism whose refracting Planes ABba and ACca meet in the Edge of the refracting Angle Aa. This Edge Aa being upward, is parallel both to the Horizon, and to the Parallel-Edges of the Paper DJ and HE, and the transverse Line FG is perpendicular to the Plane of the Window. And de represents the Image of the Paper seen by Refraction upwards in such manner, that the blue half DG is carried higher to dg than the red half FE is to fe, and therefore suffers a greater Refraction. If the Edge of the refracting Angle be turned downward, the Image of the Paper will be refracted downward; suppose to [Greek: de], and the blue half will be refracted lower to [Greek: dg] than the red half is to [Greek: pe].|$|E
60|$|Exper. 7. At {{two holes}} made near {{one another in}} my Window-shut I placed two Prisms, one at each, which might cast upon the {{opposite}} Wall (after {{the manner of the}} third Experiment) two oblong coloured Images of the Sun. And at a little distance from the Wall I placed a long slender Paper with straight and parallel edges, and ordered the Prisms and Paper so, that the red Colour of one Image might fall directly upon one half of the Paper, and the violet Colour of the other Image upon {{the other half of the}} same Paper; so that the Paper appeared of two Colours, red and violet, much after the manner of the painted Paper in the first and second Experiments. Then with a black Cloth I covered the Wall behind the Paper, that no Light might be reflected from it to disturb the Experiment, and viewing the Paper through a third Prism held parallel to it, I saw that half of it which was illuminated by the violet Light to be divided from the other half by a greater Refraction, especially when I went a good way off from the Paper. For when I viewed it too near at hand, the two <b>halfs</b> of the Paper did not appear fully divided from one another, but seemed contiguous at one of their Angles like the painted Paper in the first Experiment. Which also happened when the Paper was too broad.|$|E
60|$|Exper. 2. About the {{aforesaid}} Paper, whose two <b>halfs</b> {{were painted}} over {{with red and}} blue, and which was stiff like thin Pasteboard, I lapped several times a slender Thred of very black Silk, in such manner that the several parts of the Thred might appear upon the Colours like so many black Lines drawn over them, or like long and slender dark Shadows cast upon them. I might have drawn black Lines with a Pen, but the Threds were smaller and better defined. This Paper thus coloured and lined I set against a Wall perpendicularly to the Horizon, so {{that one of the}} Colours might stand to the Right Hand, and the other to the Left. Close before the Paper, at the Confine of the Colours below, I placed a Candle to illuminate the Paper strongly: For the Experiment was tried in the Night. The Flame of the Candle reached up to the lower edge of the Paper, or a very little higher. Then at the distance of six Feet, and one or two Inches from the Paper upon the Floor I erected a Glass Lens four Inches and a quarter broad, which might collect the Rays coming from the several Points of the Paper, and make them converge towards so many other Points at the same distance of six Feet, and one or two Inches {{on the other side of}} the Lens, and so form the Image of the coloured Paper upon a white Paper placed there, after the same manner that a Lens at a Hole in a Window casts the Images of Objects abroad upon a Sheet of white Paper in a dark Room. The aforesaid white Paper, erected perpendicular to the Horizon, and to the Rays which fell upon it from the Lens, I moved sometimes towards the Lens, sometimes from it, to find the Places where the Images of the blue and red Parts of the coloured Paper appeared most distinct. Those Places I easily knew by the Images of the black Lines which I had made by winding the Silk about the Paper. For the Images of those fine and slender Lines (which by reason of their Blackness were like Shadows on the Colours) were confused and scarce visible, unless when the Colours on either side of each Line were terminated most distinctly, Noting therefore, as diligently as I could, the Places where the Images of the red and blue <b>halfs</b> of the coloured Paper appeared most distinct, I found that where the red half of the Paper appeared distinct, the blue half appeared confused, so that the black Lines drawn upon it could scarce be seen; and on the contrary, where the blue half appeared most distinct, the red half appeared confused, so that the black Lines upon it were scarce visible. And between the two Places where these Images appeared distinct there was the distance of an Inch and a half; the distance of the white Paper from the Lens, when the Image of the red half of the coloured Paper appeared most distinct, being greater by an Inch and an half than the distance of the same white Paper from the Lens, when the Image of the blue half appeared most distinct. In like Incidences therefore of the blue and red upon the Lens, the blue was refracted more by the Lens than the red, so as to converge sooner by an Inch and a half, and therefore is more refrangible.|$|E
