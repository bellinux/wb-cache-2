25|$|An <b>intentional</b> <b>tort</b> {{requires}} an overt act, {{some form of}} intent, and causation. In most cases, transferred intent, which occurs when the defendant intends to injure an individual but actually ends up injuring another individual, will satisfy the intent requirement. Causation can be satisfied {{as long as the}} defendant was a substantial factor in causing the harm.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{employees}} {{of a local}} government, including the highest-level executives of that body, have no power to bind the local government to a contract that is void due {{to one of the}} above scenarios. This is because the limitations on the power of the local government to contract are a matter of public record. As a general rule, the individual employee is immune from being sued for inadvertently entering into a void contract with a private party. However, this immunity does not extend to the <b>intentional</b> <b>tort</b> of fraud. If a local government employee knowingly and intentionally made a false representation to a third party that the local government would be bound to a particular contract, that employee could be sued for damages suffered by the third party's reliance on that false promise.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} are affirmative defenses to <b>intentional</b> <b>torts.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Conversion is an {{interference}} with another's ownership of property. [...] It {{is a general}} intent tort, not a specific intent tort. [...] That means that the intent to take or otherwise deal with the property is enough to support the claim, and it doesn't matter whether the defendant knew that the act would constitute {{interference with}} the property of another. [...] Therefore, the defendant's innocent reasons for the act cannot {{be used as an}} excuse. [...] It does not matter if the defendant made a mistake. The standard remedy for conversion is a judgment for damages in an amount equal to the fair market value of the property. Punitive damages are also possible, because conversion is an <b>intentional</b> <b>tort.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1985, a {{civil suit}} were filed against the World Plan Executive Council, in the U.S.A. by Robert Kropinski, Jane Greene, Patrick Ryan and Diane Hendel {{claiming}} fraud and psychological, physical, and emotional harm {{as a result of}} the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi programs. The district court dismissed Kropinski's claims concerning <b>intentional</b> <b>tort</b> and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and referred the claims of fraud and negligent infliction of physical and psychological injuries to a jury trial. The jury awarded Kropinski $137,890 in the fraud and negligence claims. The appellate court overturned the award and dismissed Kropinski's claim alleging psychological damage. The claim of fraud and the claim of a physical injury related to his practice of the TM-Sidhi program were remanded to the lower court for retrial. Kropinski, Green, Ryan and the defendants settled the remaining claims out of court on undisclosed terms. The remaining suit by Hendel, not included in the settlement, was later dismissed because the claims were barred by the statute of limitations. In affirming the dismissal, the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit held that Hendel's claims were time-barred under the discovery rule because [...] "...the defendants made representations which any reasonable person would recognize as being contrary to common human experience and, indeed, to the laws of physics. If, as Ms. Hendel alleges, she was told that meditators would slowly rise in the air, and that some of them were 'flying over Lake Lucern' or 'walking through walls, hovering, and becoming invisible,' and that her failure to go to bed on time could bring about World War III, then a reasonable person would surely have noticed, at some time prior to September 1, 1986, that some of these representations might not be true." ...|$|E
50|$|Consent can be {{a defense}} to any <b>intentional</b> <b>tort,</b> {{although}} lack of consent is occasionally incorporated into the definition of an <b>intentional</b> <b>tort,</b> such as trespass to land. However, lack of consent is not always an essential element to establish a prima facie case in such situations. Therefore, it is properly treated as an affirmative defense.|$|E
50|$|Lastly, {{there is}} the issue of {{negligence}} and <b>intentional</b> <b>torts</b> in a single lawsuit. Courts, in the majority, do not apply comparative responsibility to <b>intentional</b> <b>torts.</b> However, some courts apply comparative responsibility to <b>intentional</b> <b>torts.</b> The law and academia on this issue is very complex, but typically support holding intentional tortfeasors in a suit subject to joint and several liability. Further, any negligent tortfeasor who negligently failed to protect the plaintiff from the intentional tortfeaser will be jointly and severally liable for the portion of the intentional tortfeasor's fault. This view is supported by the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability Section 1.|$|R
40|$|The {{opportunities}} and challenges faced by litigants who strategically plead <b>intentional</b> <b>torts</b> are borne out by two recent medical cases. Both arose out of dental treatment. Dean v Phung established some key principles which were clarified in White v Johnston. Before considering those two cases it is worth examining {{the environment in which}} such <b>intentional</b> <b>torts</b> claims now exist. Following the Ipp Review of the Law of Negligence, non-uniform legislative changes to the law of negligence were introduced across Australia which have imposed limitations on liability and quantum of damages in cases where a person has been injured through the fault of another. While it seems that, given the limitation of the scope of the review and recommendations to negligently caused damage, the Ipp Review reforms were meant to be limited to injury resulting from negligent acts rather than <b>intentional</b> <b>torts,</b> {{the extent to which the}} civil liability legislation applies to <b>intentional</b> <b>torts</b> differs across Australia...|$|R

50|$|In United States v. Muniz, 374 U.S. 150 (1963), the Supreme Court {{held that}} the <b>intentional</b> <b>tort</b> {{exception}} did not apply when prison guards were negligent in preventing a prisoner from assault. This case could have been decided because the claim arose out of the negligence of the prisoner guards, and the assault was just the natural causal effect of the negligence, or because the Supreme Court held that if the only issue was whether the Government should {{be held liable for}} Carr's action, the <b>intentional</b> <b>tort</b> exception would preclude litigation under the FTCA.|$|E

25|$|<b>Intentional</b> <b>torts</b> are any <b>intentional</b> {{acts that}} are {{reasonably}} foreseeable to cause harm to an individual, and that do so. <b>Intentional</b> <b>torts</b> have several subcategories, including tort(s) against the person, including assault, battery, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and fraud. Property <b>torts</b> involve any <b>intentional</b> {{interference with the}} property rights of the claimant. Those commonly recognised include trespass to land, trespass to chattels, and conversion.|$|R
40|$|According to {{the most}} recent draft of the Restatement (Third) of Torts: <b>Intentional</b> <b>Torts</b> to Persons, the <b>intentional</b> <b>torts</b> protect the rightholder’s {{interests}} differently from negligence-based rules and strict liability, placing them into a distinct substantive category. This conceptualization, however, does not provide courts with adequate guidance on how to formulate the element of intent. Different formulations can protect the rightholder’s interests differently from negligence and strict liability, so something else must determine the appropriate way to formulate the element of intent. The draft Restatement’s reasoning can be easily extended to provide a more useful conceptualization of the <b>intentional</b> <b>torts.</b> The practice of tort law involves the enforcement of behavioral norms, and so the substantive categories of tort law should correspond to normatively distinguishable categories of behavior. For tort purposes, three different paradigmatic forms of social behavior are relevant: aggressive interactions; interactions of mutual advantage; and the remaining nonaggressive, risk-creating interactions that are not motivated by an expectation of mutual benefit. Within this normative framework, the category of <b>intentional</b> <b>torts</b> is defined by aggressive interactions, which involve intentional harms that are normatively different from accidental harms. The <b>intentional</b> <b>torts</b> accordingly protect different interests in a distinctive manner as per the rationale in the draft Restatement. This normative framework straightforwardly explains a number of established rules while also resolving two questions of intent that have vexed courts and commentators. Difficult issues of intent involve hard questions about how the conduct is best categorized for tort purposes. Once the categories have been conceptualized in behavioral terms, the element of intent has a clear substantive purpose: it determines whether or not an interaction is aggressive and properly governed by the <b>intentional</b> <b>torts...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Article {{systematically}} {{looks at}} domestic {{violence as a}} torts issue and also critiques how tort theory prioritizes accidents over <b>intentional</b> <b>torts.</b> After showing how domestic violence fits within the categories of <b>intentional</b> <b>torts</b> including battery, assault, false imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional distress, the article highlights the disjunction between the prevalence of domestic violence and the virtual absence of tort suits seeking compensation for domestic violence injuries. The article analyzes the reasons for that absence and finds a range of explanations. Some of the explanations are practical, such as the ‘intentional acts exclusion’ in liability insurance and short statutes of limitations for <b>intentional</b> <b>torts,</b> which together with other factors guarantee {{that there will be}} little litigation in this area. This in turn means that the torts system is not serving deterrence or compensation functions and is leaving domestic violence unaddressed. More broadly, the <b>torts</b> system considers <b>intentional</b> <b>torts</b> more serious than negligence, but promotes compensation for negligence rather than <b>intentional</b> <b>torts.</b> The article calls for creative responses to the problem of domestic violence torts, and proposes a revised approach to auto insurance which would include a required minimum coverage for domestic violence torts, spreading the costs rather than letting them fall solely on the victims. Finally, the article critiques the accident-centered focus of twentieth-century tort law, calling for a focus that includes a broader range of harms...|$|R

50|$|As {{a matter}} of public policy, damages {{available}} for <b>intentional</b> <b>torts</b> tend to be broader and more generous than for negligent torts. To preserve individual well-being and overall social welfare, society generally wishes to deter its members from intentionally attacking each other. For example, in the United States, it is easier to get punitive damages (damages above and beyond compensatory damages) if one can prove that the <b>tort</b> was <b>intentional.</b> Similarly, in most Australian jurisdictions, <b>intentional</b> <b>torts</b> are not included in civil liability legislation, thus excluding the threshold of injury and damages payouts from various legislated limitations and caps. But it is harder to prove <b>intentional</b> <b>torts</b> because as with many felony crimes, one must prove subjective elements involving the content of the defendant's mind, and defendants do not always express their harmful intent out loud or in writing.|$|R
