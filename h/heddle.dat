5|$|During the Second World War, Sargent and the Liverpool Philharmonic {{accompanied}} Albert Sammons, the dedicatee, in his 1944 {{recording of}} the Delius Violin Concerto. Later, in 1965, with Jacqueline du Pré, in her début recording, Sargent recorded Delius's Cello Concerto, coupled with the Songs of Farewell (1965). At {{the end of the}} war, Sargent turned to recording Elgar. A recording regularly chosen over all others in comparative surveys is the first of Sargent's two versions of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius with <b>Heddle</b> Nash as tenor and the familiar Sargent pairing of the Huddersfield Choral Society and the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, recorded in 1945. Sargent was also the conductor for Heifetz's 1949 recording of Elgar's Violin Concerto and Paul Tortelier's first {{recording of the}} Cello Concerto in 1954. He also recorded Elgar's Wand of Youth Suite No. 2, with the BBC; the Pomp and Circumstance Marches 1 and 4 with the LSO; and the Enigma Variations with the Philharmonia. Sargent made two recordings of Holst's The Planets: a monaural version with the LSO for Decca (1950) and a stereo version with the BBC for EMI (1960). He also recorded shorter Holst pieces: The Perfect Fool ballet music and the Beni Mora suite.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{recordings}} with conductors {{closely associated with}} Puccini. In the 1946 RCA Victor recording, Arturo Toscanini, who conducted {{the world premiere of}} the opera, conducts the NBC Symphony Orchestra with Jan Peerce as Rodolfo and Licia Albanese as Mimì. It is the only recording of a Puccini opera by its original conductor. Thomas Beecham, who worked closely with Puccini when preparing a 1920 production of La bohème in London, conducted a performance of the opera in English released by Columbia Records in 1936 with Lisa Perli as Mimì and <b>Heddle</b> Nash as Rodolfo. Beecham also conducts on the 1956 RCA Victor recording with Victoria de los Ángeles and Jussi Björling as Mimì and Rodolfo.|$|E
25|$|As the 1920s unfurled, Coates faced {{competition}} at home from an emerging generation of British tenors led by Walter Widdop and <b>Heddle</b> Nash. He toured overseas energetically and in 1925 {{he made his}} only extended tour of North America, including Canada {{as well as the}} United States on his itinerary. For this trip his usual partner on the piano, Berkeley Mason, was not available. Instead, he found Gerald Moore, then a young accompanist {{at the beginning of his}} career. Moore had often heard Coates' recitals at Chelsea Town Hall, but it was through the Australian baritone Peter Dawson (with whom Moore had toured) that the contact came. Once the contact was made, Moore became Coates' sole accompanist for four or five years. Moore devotes a chapter of his memoirs to Coates. He found the tenor a hard taskmaster, but one who transformed him from a mediocre accompanist to an artist with a full realisation of the duties and possibilities of the accompanist's role, aware of the necessity of being a full participant in every living nuance and accent of the music at hand. Moore considered that Coates had laid the groundwork of whatever was truly excellent in his work. Indeed, Coates had told him that the American tour would 'kill or cure' him, and considered the result a 'cure'. The Coates-Moore partnership eventually dissolved over a rehearsal-fees' disagreement, though any cracks in the friendship were repaired by 1929.|$|E
500|$|Recordings of {{individual}} scenes and numbers {{were made by}} Sadler's Wells singers from the company's earliest days. In 1972 an LP set was issued bringing together many of these recordings, prefaced with a tribute to Lilian Baylis recorded in 1936. Among the singers in the set are Joan Cross, <b>Heddle</b> Nash, Edith Coates, Joan Hammond, Owen Brannigan, Peter Pears, Peter Glossop and Charles Craig. The conductors include Lawrance Collingwood, [...] Reginald Goodall and Michael Mudie.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} common types of metal heddles: wire, inserted eye, and flat steel. The inserted eye {{are considered to}} be the best, as they have a smooth eye with no rough ends to catch the warp. Wire <b>heddles</b> are second in quality, followed by the flat steel. Wire <b>heddles</b> look much like the inserted eye <b>heddles,</b> but where in the inserted eye there is a circle of metal for the eye, the wire ones are simply twisted at the top and bottom. The flat metal <b>heddles</b> are considered the poorest in quality as they are heavier and bulkier, as well as not being as smooth. They are a flat piece of steel, with the ends rotated slightly so that the flat side is at an angle of 45 degrees to the shaft. The eye is simply a hole cut {{in the middle of the}} piece of metal.|$|R

500|$|Barbirolli's {{ambition}} was to conduct. He was {{the prime}} mover {{in establishing the}} Guild of Singers and Players Chamber Orchestra in 1924, and in 1926 {{he was invited to}} conduct a new ensemble at the Chenil Gallery in Chelsea, initially called the [...] "Chenil Chamber Orchestra" [...] but later renamed [...] "John Barbirolli's Chamber Orchestra". Barbirolli's concerts impressed Frederic Austin, director of the British National Opera Company (BNOC), who in the same year invited him to conduct some performances with the company. Barbirolli had never conducted a chorus or a large orchestra, but had the confidence to accept. He made his operatic debut directing Gounod's Roméo et Juliette at Newcastle, followed within days by performances of Aida and Madama Butterfly. He conducted the BNOC frequently over the next two years, and made his debut at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, with Madama Butterfly in 1928. The following year he was invited to conduct the opening work in Covent Garden's international season, Don Giovanni, with a cast that included Mariano Stabile, Elisabeth Schumann and <b>Heddle</b> Nash.|$|E

2500|$|Politicians in {{the three}} island groups {{referred}} to the Scottish referendum {{as the most important}} event in their political history [...] "since the inception of the island councils in 1975". Angus Campbell, leader of the Western Isles, said that the ongoing constitutional debate offered the [...] "opportunity for the three island councils to secure increased powers for our communities to take decisions which will benefit the economies and the lives of those who live in the islands". In a meeting of the island councils in March 2013, leaders of the three territories discussed their future in the event of Scottish independence. This included whether the islands could demand and achieve autonomous status within either Scotland or the rest of the UK. Among the scenarios proposed were achieving either Crown Dependency status or self-government modelled after the Faroe Islands, in association with either Scotland or the UK. Steven <b>Heddle,</b> Orkney's council leader, described pursuing Crown Dependency status as the least likely option, as it would threaten funding from the EU, which is essential for local farmers. Alasdair Allan, MSP for the Western Isles, said independence could {{have a positive impact on}} the isles, as [...] "crofters and farmers could expect a substantial uplift in agricultural and rural development funding via the Common Agricultural Policy if Scotland were an independent member state of the EU".|$|E

60|$|In our {{older and}} more {{energetic}} colonial days we had a garrison on the Isles de Los. They found the climate inferior to the Banana group, off Cape Shilling. Factory Island still deserves its name. Here M. Verminck, of Marseille, the successor of King <b>Heddle,</b> has a factory on the eastern side, an establishment managed by an agent and six clerks, with large white dwellings, store-houses, surf-boats, and a hulk to receive his palm-oil. The latter produces the finest prize-cockroaches I have yet seen.|$|E
60|$|Passing the easternmost {{end of the}} peninsula, and sailing {{along the}} Bullom ('lowland') shores, we {{verified}} Dr. Blyden's assertion that this 'home of fevers' shows no outward and visible sign of exceeding unhealthiness. The soil is sandy, the bush is comparatively thin, and the tall trees give it the aspect of a high and dry land. We then turned north-east and skirted Tasso Island, a strip of river-holm girt with a wall of mangroves. It had an old English fort, founded in 1695; the factors traded with the Pulo (Fulah) country for slaves, ivory, and gold. It was abandoned after being taken by Van Ruyter, when he restored to the Dutch West Indian Company the conquests of Commodore Holmes. The rich soil in 1800 supported a fine cotton plantation, and here Mr. <b>Heddle</b> kept a 'factory.' The villagers turned out to gaze, not habited like the Wolofs of Albreda, but clad in shady hats and seedy pantaloons.|$|E

60|$|Running the eye {{west of the}} Battery, a few wooden {{houses or}} sheds, some of them {{overhanging}} the dwarf cliff, the black rocks, and the red-yellow sands, lead to Taylor's warehouses, a huge pile of laterite still unfinished. Here the traditional 'man and boy' may sometimes be seen working in the cooler and more comfortable hours. Beyond it, on a level with the water, stands the new camber, where we shall land. Then comes the huge block built by Mr. Charles <b>Heddle,</b> of Hoy, who by grace of a large fortune, honourably made at Freetown, has become proprietor of a noble château and broad lands in France. It has now been converted into the Crown commissariat-store. The sea-frontage has a clear fall of eighty feet, whereas, from the street behind the wooden upper story, it appears below the average height. Very mean are the custom-house and adjoining coal-shed. Governor 'Dangan's Wharf,' a contemptible jetty, and its puny lighthouse have at length made way for a quay, along which ships, despite sunken rocks, were expected to lie; but the sea soon broke down the perpendicular wall, {{and now it is}} being rebuilt with a 'batter.' A hollow square behind it shows the workmen blasting the material, a fine-grained grey granite, which seems here, as at Axim, to be the floor-rock of the land. No wonder that the new harbour-works have cost already 70,000l., of which 50,637l. are still owed, and that the preposterous wharfage-duty is 10s. per ton. To avoid this and the harbour-dues, ships anchor, whenever they safely can, in the offing, where the shoals are Nature's breakwaters. West of the quarry-hollow, in my day a little grassy square, are the old Commissariat-quarters, now a bonded warehouse. This building is also a long low cottage viewed from inland, and a tall, grim structure seen from the sea. On a higher level stands St. George's, once a church, but years ago promoted to a cathedral-dignity, making Freetown proud as Barchester Towers. We shall presently pass it and its caricature, the pert little Wesleyan church to its east. The extreme west of the triangle-base is occupied by the gaol. No longer a 'barn-like structure faced by a black wall,' it is a lengthy scatter of detached buildings, large enough to accommodate half the population, and distinguished by its colour, a light ashen grey. Behind this projecting site lies King Jimmy's Bridge, a causeway through whose central arch a stream of sparkling water winds its way seawards.|$|E
50|$|Rigid heddles {{are thus}} very {{different}} from the <b>heddle</b> in common use, though the single <b>heddle</b> derived from the rigid <b>heddle.</b> The advantage of non-rigid heddles is that the weaver has more freedom, and can create a wider variety of fabrics. Rigid <b>heddle</b> looms resemble the standard floor loom in appearance.|$|E
50|$|The heddles on an inkle loom, {{while they}} are of a {{completely}} different form, are generally made of string. Inkle looms only require a simple loop for a <b>heddle,</b> and every other thread goes through a <b>heddle,</b> as in a rigid <b>heddle</b> loom.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{equipment}} includes yarn of the weaver's choice, yarn or thread for forming <b>heddles</b> and {{a shuttle}} {{to hold the}} weft. A notebook is also handy for charting weaving diagrams.|$|R
50|$|Dobby looms first {{appeared}} around 1843, roughly 40 years after Joseph Marie Jacquard invented the Jacquard device {{that can be}} mounted atop a loom to lift the individual <b>heddles</b> and warp threads.|$|R
25|$|Definition: Forming loops for {{the purpose}} of weaving or the making of net like materials. This is also the {{threading}} of two <b>heddles</b> on a loom to allow a 'shed' for the shuttlecock to pass through. According to the Rambam it is the making of net-like materials.|$|R

50|$|While the {{majority}} of heddles are as described, this style of <b>heddle</b> has derived from older styles, several of which are still in use. Rigid <b>heddle</b> looms, for example, instead of having one <b>heddle</b> for each thread, have a shaft with the 'heddles' fixed, and all threads go through every shaft.|$|E
50|$|Shemma, shama, and kuta are all cotton-based cloths {{used for}} making Ethiopian clothing. Three types of looms {{are used in}} Africa: the double <b>heddle</b> loom for narrow strips of cloth, the single <b>heddle</b> loom for wider spans of cloth, and the ground or pit loom. The double <b>heddle</b> loom and single <b>heddle</b> loom might be of African origin. The ground or pit loom {{is used in the}} Horn of Africa, Madagascar, and North Africa and is of Middle Eastern origins.|$|E
50|$|Tablet weaving is {{especially}} freeing, because any pattern {{can be created}} by turning individual tablets. This {{is in contrast to}} normal looms, in which the complexity of the pattern is limited by the number of shafts available to lift threads, and the threading of the <b>heddles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The major {{components}} of the loom are the warp beam, <b>heddles,</b> harnesses or shafts (as few as two, four is common, sixteen not unheard of), shuttle, reed and takeup roll.
