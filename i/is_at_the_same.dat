5|$|Although it locates food by vision, {{the role}} smell has {{in how it}} {{specifically}} finds carrion has been debated. Consensus has been {{that it does not}} detect odours, and instead follows the smaller turkey and greater yellow-headed vultures, which do have a sense of smell, to a carcass, but a 1991 study demonstrated that the king vulture could find carrion in the forest without the aid of other vultures, suggesting that it locates food using an olfactory sense. The king vulture primarily eats carrion found in the forest, though it is known to venture onto nearby savannas in search of food. Once it has found a carcass, the king vulture displaces the other vultures because of its large size and strong bill. However, when it <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> kill as the larger Andean condor, the king vulture always defers to it. Using its bill to tear, it makes the initial cut in a fresh carcass. This allows the smaller, weaker-beaked vultures, which can not open the hide of a carcass, access to the carcass after the king vulture has fed. The vulture’s tongue is rasp-like, which allows it to pull flesh off of the carcass’s bones. Generally, it only eats the skin and harder parts of the tissue of its meal. The king vulture has also been recorded eating fallen fruit of the moriche palm when carrion is scarce in Bolívar state, Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway127 (Bus. US127) is a {{business}} loop of US127 through Jackson that is wholly concurrent with M-50. Its southern end is at an interchange in a rural section of Summit Township. From exit34 on US127, the business loop runs north and northwesterly, crossing the Grand River. North of the river, the roadway is bounded by businesses as it runs along Cooper Street through residential areas on the southeastern side of Jackson. In the downtown area, Bus. US127/M-50 merges with Business Loop Interstate94 (BL I-94) and splits to follow a one-way pairing of streets that form a loop through downtown. Northbound traffic continues along {{the eastern side of}} this loop on Cooper Street and crosses the Grand River again. At the intersection with Michigan Avenue, BL I-94/Bus. US127/M-50 turns westward onto Louis Glick Highway around the northern side of downtown. The business loop crosses the Grand River a third and final time along Louis Glick. On the western side of downtown, the business loop angles southwesterly as Louis Glick Highway merges into Michigan Avenue. (At the same time, the southern half of the one-way loop, Washington Street, also splits from Michigan Avenue.) BL I-94/Bus. US127/M-50 follows Michigan Avenue westward through residential neighborhoods to an intersection with West Avenue, where Bus. US127/M-50 turns northward, separating from BL I-94 (Michigan Avenue). As the business loop approaches its parent highway, it transitions into a commercial area. The northern terminus of Bus. US127 <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> interchange northwest of Jackson in Blackman Township where the US127 and I-94 freeways merge.|$|E

25|$|Mediation is {{external}} when the mediator {{of the desire}} is socially {{beyond the reach of}} the subject or, for example, a fictional character, as in the case of Amadis de Gaula and Don Quixote.
