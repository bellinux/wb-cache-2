40|$|International audienceFinding {{and fixing}} bugs are {{time-consuming}} activities in software development. Spectrum-based fault localization aims {{to identify the}} <b>faulty</b> <b>position</b> in source code based on the execution trace of test cases. Failing test cases and their assertions form test oracles for the failing behavior of the system under analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of spectrum driven test case purification for improving fault localization. The goal of test case purification is to separate existing test cases into small fractions (called purified test cases) and to enhance the test oracles to further localize faults. Combining with an original fault localization technique (e. g., Tarantula), test case purification results in better ranking the program statements. Our experiments on 1800 faults in six open-source Java programs show that test case purification can effectively improve existing fault localization techniques...|$|E
40|$|ABNORMAL retinal {{correspondence}} {{has been}} a vexed subject since the physi-ology of binocular vision and strabismus have been discussed, {{but it seems to}} be generally accepted that it is an adaptation of the sensory relations of the retina to the squinting position. Normal retinal correspondence is present when any pair of corresponding points have a common visual direction; abnormal retinal correspondence occurs when retinal areas which are ordinarily disparate prove to have a common visual direction (Swan, 1950). At the onset of a squint, retinal correspondence is normal and projection is incorrect by an amount equal to the angle of deviation, but according to Duke-Elder (1950) : at a later stage the normal orientation centred on the macula may change, a perceptual correction is made, and projection becomes correct in spite of the deviation. In essence abnormal retinal correspondence is a mental re-orientation of the displaced image of one eye in binocular fixation to make allowance for its <b>faulty</b> <b>position...</b>|$|E
40|$|Developing of fault {{tolerant}} control systems (FTCS's) for permanent magnet Brushless DC (BLDC) motor drives to diagnose and handle various faults {{have been of}} the research concentrations in the last decade. In this paper a novel fault diagnosis algorithm for position sensors (Hall Effect sensors) failure of the BLDC motor is presented. Fault detection and identification of Hall Effect sensors are based on sensors signals and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) analysis of the BLDC motor line voltages in the proposed fault diagnosis system. BLDC motor behaviour is analysed under various Hall Effect sensor faults through a validated simulation model. An expert system is developed to diagnose Hall Effect sensors faults in the BLDC motor by analysing the simulation results under different fault conditions. Correct performance of the proposed fault diagnosis system is proven through experimental data analysis. A simple technique is discussed to generate the commutation signal of the <b>faulty</b> <b>position</b> sensor and maintain operation of the BLDC motor in post-fault condition. The proposed {{fault tolerant}} control system is simple, does not need excessive computations and can be executed with the main control program of the BLDC motor on a single chip micro-controller...|$|E

40|$|International audienceVarious {{road user}} {{charging}} mechanisms {{are used to}} control traffic and its resulting pollution, as well as revenue sources for reinvestment in the road infrastructure. Among them, electronic toll collection (ETC) systems based on user positions estimated with Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are particularly attractive due to their flexibility and reduced roadside infrastructure in comparison to other systems such as tollbooths. Because GNSS positioning may be perturbed by different errors and failures, ETC systems, as liability critical applications, should monitor the integrity of GNSS signals in order to limit the use of <b>faulty</b> <b>positions</b> and the consequent charging errors. The integrity-monitoring systems have been originally designed for civil aviation; hence, {{they need to be}} adapted to the ETC requirements. This paper studies the use of receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM), which are algorithms run within the GNSS receiver and, therefore, are easier to tune to ETC needs than other systems based on external information. The weighted least squares residual RAIM used in civil aviation is analyzed, and an algorithm modification for ETC is proposed. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed RAIM algorithm has a superior level of availability over civil-aviation-based RAIM procedures, particularly in urban environments...|$|R

Reject analysis was performed in the Department of Radiology, University Hospital in Linköping, Sweden, during 22 weeks 1992 and 5 weeks 1994. Between the two occasions, an education and training program was carried through. The rejected films were classified acording to 6 criteria. The reject frequency was 9. 9 % before and 8. 5 % after. Faulty exposure and <b>faulty</b> <b>positioning</b> of the patient contributing with 53 % of all rejected films. It was shown that reject analysis can easily be carried through. Compared to reports from the literature, the level found here was neither high nor low. The decrease in reject frequency after the training program was low and probably not significant. Reducing the rejections results in reduced patient doses and lower costs for the films. However, too low frequencies may be an indication of accepting bad image quality and reduced diagnostic accuracy. In the future when digital equipment is more frequently introduced the rejection of films will decrease, but not necessarily the retakes. Here, measurements of mean absorbed doses to the patients may provide a better toal for quality assurance of the radiology department...|$|R
40|$|Overestimation of the {{efficacy}} of conservative treatment of spine injuries children often leads to unsatisfactory long-term results. The effective correction of post-traumatic spinal column deformities occurs in patients who undergo the operation in the early post-traumatic period. While choosing treatment strategies for children, higher reparative opportunities, which provide early fracture consolidation, including those in <b>faulty</b> <b>positions,</b> should be considered. This study presents a case of surgical treatment for uncomplicated injury of the thoracic and lumbar spine, with long-term compression fragmental fracture of the L 1 vertebra body in a 12 -year-old child. Due to the long-standing character of the injury right thoraco-frenotomy was conducted with partial L 1 vertebral body and resection of the adjacent discs, deformity correction of the thoracic and lumbar spine with a transpedicular system, and ventral spondylodesis with an autograft. This extensive intervention was justified by the peculiarities in the vertebral body damage and the post-traumatic segmental kyphotic deformity that resulted from delayed medical treatment. An anterior approach was chosen to achieve immobilization {{at the site of}} the damage before correction using the transpedicular system. Surgical correction of long-term spinal injuries in children, with the use of a combined approach, is usually laborious and traumatic. The prevention of rigid post-traumatic spine deformities with the help of timely diagnostics and appropriate treatment, including surgery, should be a priority to prevent such cases...|$|R

The authors were influenced to carry out the research by observing the patients suffering from discopathy with frequent <b>faulty</b> <b>positioning</b> of lower limbs – genu valgum, which was accompanied by increased range of external hip joint rotation. The assumed thesis was that wrong mobility of hip joints is conducive to development of lumbosacral disc disorder. Methods. 73 people were subjected to the research among whom 36 had discopathy and were qualified for surgical treatment in Neurosurgery Clinic of 10 thMilitary Hospital in Bydgoszcz. The rest (control group- 37 people) did not have any lumbosacral disc disorders. Hip joints mobility was measured according to SFTR method. The range of mobility was mesured in all planes. Results. The relation between occurrence of discopathy in LS spine and increased values of mobility in hip joints was noted. The most substantial mobility differences between the research and control groups were related internal / external rotation. Conclusions. The developmnet of disorders in these segments of spine is influnced by biomechanical factors in pelvis and lower limbs. Confirmation of the results in a bigger-scale research may result in introduction of prophylaxis of disc disorders in people with hypermobility of hip joints even at their teen age...|$|R
40|$|The key to {{maritime}} surveillance {{is an accurate}} and real-time update of the current traffic situation. Although the Automatic Identification System (AIS) has greatly improved the traffic situation assessment over the past years, it has shown to be error-prone and vulnerable to spoofing or intentional misuse. To obtain a more reliable picture of a vessel’s motion this work proposes the fusion of AIS and Radar data in a loosely coupled architecture. For that reason, an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) Multi Sensor Probabilistic Data Association (PDA) filter was designed not only to fuse measurements from different sources, but also to best capture the different dynamic states of a single vessel. In the IMM two Unscented Kalman Filters (UKFs) run in parallel and interact with each other, each implementing a different dynamic model, the CV and CTRV, respectively. Each UKF is conditioned on asynchronous measurements obtained from either AIS or Radar. In case of the latter, measurements of a target candidate may also originate from clutter, not from the target itself. The PDA filtering approach not only associates these measurements to the actual target state but also acts as innovation gate for <b>faulty</b> AIS <b>position</b> updates. A standard blob detection algorithm was implemented and tuned for extracting target candidates in range and bearing from Radar images. To show {{the benefits of the}} proposed scheme a dedicated measurement campaign was performed in the Baltic Sea with a stationary ship monitoring a highly manoeuvring target vessel. With the proposed approach not only short term AIS induced errors can be detected and rejected but what may also become observable is suspicious AIS behaviour including anomalous position data or muted transponders...|$|R
40|$|Malagasy {{studies have}} been dominated, {{at least in the}} general opinion, rightly or wrongly, by the work of two great pioneers, Grandidier and Ferrand, who adopted {{opposing}} stances {{on the question of the}} peopling of Madagascar. Grandidier (1908) represents the viewpoint privileging Hindo-Austronesian and even Melanesian origins. Ferrand (1908), over and beyond an initial undetermined settlement from Africa which he nevertheless supports, perceives there to have been a second wave of settlement from Africa followed by migrations of Austronesians with some Persian/Arab admixtures. The major difference between these two viewpoints is that, for Grandidier, Africa played only a minor role late in the process, which he is inclined to relegate to recent slaving episodes, whereas the black element in the population he attributes to a Melanesian component. We show here that this reading is <b>faulty.</b> This <b>position</b> may perhaps be put down to the fact that Grandidier himself arrived in Madagascar from the east: health reasons had caused him to leave India to recuperate in the Mascarene Islands (Mauritius and Reunion), from where he travelled to Madagascar. Ferrand, on the other hand, from the very beginning considered the earliest periods of settlement to involve a Bantu element. The Persian/Arab adjuncts are represented as occurring over a period of centuries, from around the 10 th to the 16 th. The Austronesian component, which he traces to the Indonesian archipelago, is very long established, but he has it preceded by the Bantu element. Though his views evolved somewhat between the end of the 19 th century and his death in 1935, they continued to broadly conform to this schema. These two authors, who both enjoyed a great scientific reputation, have been to a greater or lesser extent followed by other researchers throughout the 20 th century...|$|R
40|$|This work {{analyzes}} the connectivity of large diameter networks where every link has an independent probability p of failure. We give a (relatively simple) topological condition that guarantees good connectivity between regions {{of such a}} network. Good connectivity means that the regions are connected by nearly as many disjoint, fault-free paths as there are when the entire network is fault-free. The topological condition is satisfied in many cases of practical interest, even when two regions are at a distance {{much larger than the}} expected "distance between faults", 1 /p. We extend this result to networks with failures on nodes, as well as geometric radio networks with random distribution of nodes in a deployment area of a given topography. A rigorous formalization of the intuitive notion of "hole" in a (not necessarily planar) graph {{is at the heart of}} our result and our proof. Holes, in the presence of faults, degrade connectivity in the region "around" them to a distance that grows with the size of the hole and the density of faults. Thus, to guarantee good connectivity between two regions even in the presence of faults, the intervening network should not only sport multiple paths, but also not too many large holes. Our result essentially characterizes networks where connectivity depends on the "big picture" structure of the network, and not on the local "noise" caused by <b>faulty</b> or imprecisely <b>positioned</b> nodes and links...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is both {{an analytical}} life history of Stó:lō Elder Archie Charles (1922 - 2010) {{as well as an}} academic reflection on the process of collaborating to record and write this told-to narrative. Grand Chief Archie Charles left a profound social, political and cultural legacy within the Stó:lō community. He is broadly acknowledged as one of the community’s most respected modern leaders. My examination of the way Archie strategically accepted and rejected elements of the teachings of his ancestors and the lessons learned from newcomers serves to enrich a growing body of post-colonial scholarship that challenges long-standing assumptions {{about what it means to}} be Aboriginal. The agency revealed through his life experience alerts us to the dynamic way in which Archie and certain others of his generation balanced innovation with tradition. This study of Archie’s life therefore, contributes to an emerging scholarship that challenges still lingering racist myths and <b>faulty</b> dualisms that <b>position</b> Native people as either “assimilated” or “resisting”. Through Archie’s story, I reveal the way in which he applied knowledge and skills he gained via the acculturation process (and his lifelong reflections on this process) to foster particular cultural continuities within areas of Stó:lō life. Archie successfully did this by enacting his own personal ethos of “protection through inclusion and education”. This research chronicles and interprets the genesis and evolution of his leadership strategy by tracing it back to his adaptive interpretations of his ancestral and familial teachings and highlighting key times in Archie’s life history when he worked to find a balance between innovation and tradition. Thus it foregrounds his formative experience with Xwelítem (newcomers) and Stó:lō society and cosmology, particularly his adoption, time spent attending Kamloops Indian Residential School, and involvement as a soldier and veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces. It highlights how he derived meaning out of these experiences, which in turn guided his actions in the public sphere and shaped his policies as a community leader –in particular as elected Chief of his community of Seabird Island British Columbia and as a Sia:teleq (a hereditary caretaker) of his family fishcamp in the Fraser Canyon. This research draws upon my own sustained dialogue with Archie Charles and his immediate family, secondary and primary sources, and previous oral history interviews conducted with Archie and his family members. It explicates Archie’s role as a man who was known more for his actions than his words and the ways in which silence may be interpreted and made meaningful in the told-to genre. In terms that reflect the subtleties of collaborative dynamics that play out in told-to narratives, it likewise examines his role as narrator and authority of his life experience and my role as chronicler, then interpreter. As such, it provides glimpses into specific time periods and aspects of Archie’s life, but does not seek to be fully chronologic and comprehensive. As a result, I seek to contribute to collaborative historiography by sharing the way in which my collaboration with Archie shifted from a dialogue, particularly following his death in 2010, to a “polylogue”: an engagement of multiple voices of family and extended community members to support this telling of his life narrative. Moving from hearing to a more engaged form of “listening” as we did – the kind which allows for silences to exist – reinforced for me that knowledge, expressed through words, gestures, actions as well as silences are not things we can go into a community or individual’s life and “get”. Rather, they are shared as gifts, and as such come with obligations of reciprocity. This dissertation aspires to reciprocate the sharing that Archie did with me by providing his community and my scholarly community with not only an account of his life, but with an assessment of what his life reveals about pertinent issues in Aboriginal and Native-Newcomer history – and through this process to hopefully contribute to the ongoing efforts at building reconciliation between settler and Indigenous societies...|$|R
