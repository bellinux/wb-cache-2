40|$|Electrochemical Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is able {{to image}} the atomic {{structure}} of electrodes and monitor how that structure changes over time. We want to use electrochemical STM to design a better fuel cell catalyst, but we must first find a cost effective way to manufacture the tips that get consumed after every scan. Production of tips for STM in an electrochemical environment is a two phase process. First platinum-iridium wire must be sharpened to a radius of curvature {{on the order of}} nanometers. We accomplished this by immersing the platinum-iridium wire in a supersaturated calcium chloride solution and running alternating current through the cell At the air-liquid interface the platinum is etched away and the meniscus formed by the surface tension of he water ensures that the platinum-iridium wire is etched on a slope that leads to an extremely point. The second phase involves preparing a tip for use in an electrochemical environment. In order to use tips in an electrochemical environment they must be insulated so no current leaks out the sides, but current can still flow through the tip. We attempted to hold the leaking current to less than 100 picoamps by coating the sides of the tip in a nonconductive material. We used an <b>electrically</b> <b>deposited</b> <b>paint,</b> also known as cataphoretic paint, to insulate the tip and inverted the needle while it dried so the paint would slide down and expose the tip of the needle. Our best coated tips had a leaking currents seven hundred picoamps so we were unable to test them in electrochemical environments, however we were able to use them in an air environment proving our method leaves the tip of the needle free...|$|E
40|$|A sixteen-run, Resolution IV, {{fractional}} factorial {{screening design}} {{has been used}} to evaluate the relative significance of seven independent material and process variables for an <b>electrically</b> <b>deposited</b> commercial acrylic <b>paint.</b> A Resolution IV design was chosen so that variable interactions could be detected without any interference from the effects of the variables themselves. Because resource limitations did not permit use of a Resolution V design, the two-way interactions were confounded with one another in groups of three, which unfortunately made interpretation of the results more complicated. Each design point was replicated once and a pair of centerpoints were run at the beginning, in the middle {{and at the end of}} the design points. A total of 38 test panels were prepared. Independent variables used in this experiment were total charge, current density, mixer speed, silica content, crossover point, temperature and solids fraction. The magnitude of each independent variable's effect on the dependent response variables was estimated by fitting a first-order model with two-way interaction terms. Three-way interactions were assumed to be insignificant. Interaction confounding was eliminated by using the significance of the independent variables to determine which of the three possible interactions was significant. Data analysis was performed using the Bayes Plot option of the JMP statistics program from SAS Institute. Only effects with a posterior probability equal to or greater than 0. 95 were considered to be significant. Response variables analyzed were weight deposited, film thickness, surface roughness and plating efficiency. Results of the analysis are summarized. The following conclusions were formulated from the analysis of this experiment: Centerpoint behavior brings shelf-stability of the aqueous paint baths into question; Interactions among the material and process variables are present and significant; The magnitudes of some interaction effects equal or exceed the magnitudes of some of the effects of the independent variables; Silica is detrimental to surface smoothness, interacts strongly with other variables, is hard to keep suspended in aqueous baths, and should be replaced with a liquid rheology control agent; and Because of the significance of two-way variable interactions, One-Variable-At-A-Time experiments with this material and process could lead to erroneous conclusions about variable effects...|$|R

40|$|Carbonous {{nanomaterials}} {{are promising}} additives for composite coatings for heat-dissipation materials {{because of their}} excellent thermal conductivity. Here, copper/carbonous nanomaterial composite coatings were prepared using nanodiamond (ND) as the carbonous nanomaterial. The copper/ND composite coatings were <b>electrically</b> <b>deposited</b> onto copper substrates from a continuously stirred copper sulfate coating bath containing NDs. NDs were dispersed by ultrasonic treatment, and the initial bath pH was adjusted by adding sodium hydroxide solution or sulfuric acid solution before electrodeposition. The effects of various coating conditions—the initial ND concentration, initial bath pH, stirring speed, electrical current density, {{and the amount of}} electricity—on the ND content of the coatings were investigated. Furthermore, the surface of the NDs was modified by hydrothermal treatment to improve ND incorporation. A higher initial ND concentration and a higher stirring speed increased the ND content of the coatings, whereas a higher initial bath pH and a greater amount of electricity decreased it. The electrical current density showed a minimum ND content at approximately 5 A/dm 2. Hydrothermal treatment, which introduced carboxyl groups onto the ND surface, improved the ND content of the coatings. A copper/ND composite coating with a maximum of 3. 85 wt % ND was obtained...|$|R

The corrosion resistance of Zn–Fe plating is expected to increase by the addition of Mo as the third alloying element as it is more noble than Zn and Fe. In this study, Zn–Fe–Mo plating with a corrosion resistance nearly equivalent to that of the Zn–Ni plating was fabricated. Zn–Fe–Mo plating was <b>electrically</b> <b>deposited</b> from continuously-agitated plating baths prepared by mixing ZnSO 4, FeSO 4, Na 2 MoO 4, Na 3 C 6 H 5 O 7, and Na 2 SO 4 using Fe or Ni plates as the substrate.

40|$|Frequency-analyzed laser-light {{scattering}} (FALLS) is {{a relatively}} simple technique {{that can be used}} to measure principal characteristics of a sheet of sprayed liquid as it breaks up into ligaments and then the ligaments break up into droplets.

By logical extension, it is possible to determine the intact length from the location of the laser beam at the transition between the intact-sheet and ligament regions and to determine a breakup frequency from the results of the frequency analysis.

On one occasion, Slepian conducted a séance of simultaneous painting in collaboration with Yuri Zlotnikov.

Slepian created abstract paintings using a gas torch and paint dispensed out of a pump. He is said to have worked on a canvas a few kilometers long, by pouring paint on it from a truck. Slepian also made a pilgrimage to Nazım Hikmet, who assured him and his friends that modern art will prevail over political oppression.
