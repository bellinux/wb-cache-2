50|$|Trench raiding clubs were {{homemade}} melee weapons used by {{both the}} Allies and the Central Powers during World War I. Clubs were used during nighttime trench raiding expeditions as a quiet and effective way of killing or wounding enemy soldiers. The clubs were usually made out of wood. It was common practice to fix a metal object at the striking end (e.g. an empty Mills bomb) {{in order to maximize}} the injury inflicted. Another common design comprised a simple stave with the <b>end</b> <b>drilled</b> out and a lead weight inserted, with rows of large hobnails hammered in around its circumference. Most designs had some form of cord or leather strap at the end to wrap around the user's wrist. Bosnian soldiers serving in the Austro-Hungarian army were fond of using maces.

30|$|A stuck {{drill string}} {{results in a}} major {{non-productive}} cost in extended reach drilling engineering. The {{first step is to}} determine the depth at which the sticking has occurred. Methods of measurement have been proved useful for determining the stuck points, but these operations take considerable time. As a result of the limitation with the current operational practices, calculation methods are still preferred to estimate the stuck point depth. Current analytical methods do not consider friction and are only valid for vertical rather than extended reach wells. The numerical method is established to take full account of down hole friction, tool joint, upset <b>end</b> of <b>drill</b> pipe, combination drill strings and tubular materials so that it is valid to determine the stuck point in extended reach wells. The pull test, torsion test and combined test of rotation and pulling can be used to determine the stuck point. The results show that down hole friction, tool joint, upset <b>end</b> of <b>drill</b> pipe, tubular sizes and materials have significant effects on the pull length and/or the twist angle of the stuck drill string.|$|R
40|$|Cylindric (10 mm {{diameter}} X 15 mm deep) osteochondral defects {{were created}} in the medial femoral condyles of 5 horses to mimic clinical cases of subchondral bone cysts after debridement. The defects were created with either a standard square <b>ended</b> <b>drill</b> bit or a compaction drill bit. The compaction drill bit compresses bone laterally and distally creating a dense wall and floor. Twelve-mm sternal cancellous cylinders were compressed to 9. 25 mm and inserted into the femoral defects where they were presumed to expand and tighten the fit. The end result was sternal cancellous bone that exactly fit the femoral defects. Fluorochrome bone labels were used to confirm the origin of bone present in the defects at necropsy, which was performed after 6 months. Successful graft incorporation occurred in 3 of the compacted and 2 of the noncompacted defects. The surfaces of the successful cancellous bone grafts contained predominately fibrocartilage. The unsuccessful noncompacted defects expanded laterally and deeply into the parent bone epiphysis while the unsuccessful compacted defects remained confined to the originall...|$|R

40|$|Drilling {{optimization}} is {{very important}} during drilling operation. This is because it could save time and cost of operation thus increases the profit. Drilling optimization aims to optimize controllable variables during drilling operation such as weight on bit and bit rotation speed for obtaining maximum drilling rate. In this project, Bourgoyne and Young ROP model had been selected to {{study the effects of}} several parameters during drilling operation. Important parameters such as depth, pore pressure, equivalent circulating density, bit weight, rotary speed, bit tooth wear and jet impact force are extracted from a final drilling report. In order to study their relationship statistical method which is multiple regressions analysis has been used. The penetration model for the field is constructed using the results from statistical method. In the end, the result from analysis is used to determine optimum values of weight on bit that give optimum drilling operation. Overall, this project provides a study of the most complete mathematical model for rate of penetration that was constructed by Bourgoyne and Young. From the research the constants that represented several drilling variables had been determined. The rate of penetration for the field had been predicted based on constants for every data vs. Depth. Finally, optimized weight on bit had been calculated for several data points. In the <b>end,</b> <b>drilling</b> simulator (Drill-Sim 500) was used to prove the results based on actual field data...|$|R
