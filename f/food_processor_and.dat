By 1900 Indianapolis was at a crossroads. It had grown from a small, agricultural town into a prominent industrial city in the Midwest, but Indianapolis continued to face several challenges such as low wages for many of its workers, industrial pollution, gender and minority discrimination, and limited local capital for further development.|$|E
25|$|Pasta is {{generally}} a simple dish, but comes in many varieties {{due to its}} versatility. Some pasta dishes are served as a first course in Italy because the portion sizes are small and simple. Pasta is also prepared in light lunches, such as salads or large portion sizes for dinner. It can be prepared by hand or <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> <b>and</b> served hot or cold. Pasta sauces vary in taste, color and texture. When choosing which type of pasta and sauce to serve together, {{there is a general}} rule regarding compatibility. Simple sauces like pesto are ideal for long and thin strands of pasta while tomato sauce combines well with thicker pastas. Thicker and chunkier sauces have the better ability to cling onto the holes and cuts of short, tubular, twisted pastas. The extra sauce left on the plate after all of the pasta is eaten is often mopped up with a piece of bread. Pasta is largely carbohydrates (mainly as starch), with moderate amounts of protein and manganese.|$|E

50|$|Volume 1 {{covers the}} basics of French cooking, {{striking}} {{as much of a}} balance between the complexities of haute cuisine and the practicalities of the American home cook. Traditional favorites such as beef bourguignon, bouillabaisse, and cassoulet are featured, as are extensive instructions on how to prepare vegetables in a manner more appetizing than that of the 1960s American kitchen. This volume has been through many printings and has been reissued twice with revisions: first in 1983 with updates for changes in kitchen practice (especially the <b>food</b> <b>processor),</b> <b>and</b> then in 2003 as a 40th anniversary edition with the history of the book in the introduction.

50|$|The {{day before}} baking pīrāgi, the cook usually spends {{one or two}} hours {{preparing}} any meat and onion that will be used. Bacon and other fatty meats (such as bacon or back bacon) do not chop well in a <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> <b>and</b> tend to get caught on the blade, so the cook must hand chop these into tiny cubes, about 1.5 millimetres (about 1/16 inches). This is sometimes made easier by freezing the meat for a few minutes. Other less fatty meats (such as beef) tend {{to turn into a}} paste in the food processor, so if the meat is not already ground, the cook grinds it using a hand or electric grinder.|$|E

Conversely, {{the main reasons for}} not implementing one or more QA programs were: the costs of QA implementation and maintenance of QA programs were too high, there was no need or no legal requirement to implement QA, the business was too small, there was insufficient time, a lack of information or a lack of resources.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, Zingiber officinale (ginger) rhizome fine {{particles}} were prepared by using food processor, hammer mill and planetary ball mill and tested for their physical and thermal properties. The physical changes {{by means of}} particle size, surface morphology, FT-IR and thermal stability (TGA) were investigated. The size reduction method had a distinct effect on physical and thermal properties of ginger rhizome tested. Average particle size of ginger rhizome after using <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> <b>and</b> hammer mill was around 50 µm and 20 µm respectively while after using planetary ball mill the ginger rhizome was successfully reduced to nanoscale (222. 3 nm). Higher degree of granule surface fractured was observed {{as a result of}} a planetary ball milling process based on FESEM images. There were also some notable differences of FT-IR spectra detected. By comparing the spectra, the stretching vibration peak of OH at 3292 cm- 1 and the symmetric stretching vibration peak of the NO 2 and C=C at 1369 – 1639. 51 cm- 1 for ginger rhizome ground using food processor were disappeared. Yet, presence of possibly strong alkenes group (in the range 2850 – 2970 cm- 1) were observed in all samples tested. Ginger rhizome particles obtained from hammer milling process were found to be more stable to thermal effect where the decomposed temperature was 276. 64 °C as compared to samples milling using <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> <b>and</b> planetary ball mill. These results would provide useful insight for exploring the potential applications of ginger rhizome fine powder as functional food ingredient as well as in pharmaceutical applications...|$|E
40|$|Photolithography is a {{technique}} used to deposit metals onto substrates in specific patterns. The process uses light to transfer geometric patterns onto a light sensitive photoresist {{on the surface of}} a substrate. We have built a low-cost, maskless photolithography system assembled from a computer, a consumer projector, and a microscope. The photoresist is spun in a modified <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> <b>and</b> baked on a standard hot plate. Exposing the photoresist only takes a few minutes and allows for multiple runs on the same substrate in a short amount of time. Through multiple exposures, we can make features ranging from approximately 1 μm to 785 μm, which is especially useful when making contacts using the large features. The goal for this photolithography system is to make small electrical leads to study graphene, a two-dimensional material...|$|E
