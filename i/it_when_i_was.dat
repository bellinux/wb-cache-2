500|$|Author Katherine V. Forrest claimed Bannon and {{her books}} [...] "are {{in a class}} by themselves" [...] and credits Bannon with saving her life, writing in 2005, [...] "Overwhelming need led me to walk a {{gauntlet}} of fear up to the cash register. Fear so intense that I remember nothing more, only that I stumbled out of the store in possession of what I knew I must have, a book as necessary to me as air... I found <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> eighteen years old. It opened the door to my soul and told me who I was." ...|$|E
500|$|My mind {{rejects the}} whole present social order and Christianity—home, the {{recognised}} virtues, classes {{of life and}} religious doctrines. [...] Six years ago I left the Catholic church, hating it most fervently. I found it {{impossible for me to}} remain in it on account of the impulses of my nature. I made secret war upon <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a student and declined to accept the positions it offered me. By doing this I made myself a beggar but I retained my pride. Now I make open war upon it by what I write and say and do.|$|E
500|$|Brooks {{discussed}} the cultural {{influences on the}} novel. He claimed inspiration from [...] (1984) by Studs Terkel, stating: [...] " [...] an oral history of World War II. I read <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a teenager and it's sat with me ever since. When I sat down to write World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War, I {{wanted it to be}} in the vein of an oral history." [...] Brooks also cited renowned zombie film director George A. Romero as an influence and criticized the Return of the Living Dead films: [...] "They cheapen zombies, make them silly and campy. They've done for the living dead what the old Batman TV show did for the Dark Knight." [...] Brooks acknowledged making several references to popular culture in the novel, including one to alien robot franchise Transformers, but declined to identify the others so that readers could discover them independently.|$|E

500|$|In March 1984, when NYU student Rick Rubin and promoter-manager Russell Simmons {{founded the}} then-independent Def Jam label, 16yearold St. Albans, Queens native James Todd Smith was {{creating}} demo tapes in his grandparents' home. His grandfather, a jazz saxophonist, purchased him $2,000 worth of stereo equipment, including two turntables, an audio mixer and an amplifier. Smith later discussed his childhood background and rapping, stating that [...] "By the time I got that equipment, I {{was already a}} rapper. In this neighborhood, the kids grow up in rap. It's like speaking Spanish if you grow up in an all-Spanish house. I got into <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> about 9, and since then all I wanted {{was to make a}} record and hear it on the radio." [...] By using the mixing table he had received from his grandfather, Smith produced and mixed his own demos and sent them to various record companies throughout New York City, including Simmons' and Rubin's own Def Jam Recordings.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Michigan, Bump {{turned down an}} offer to play {{professional}} football for the Detroit Lions, saying {{he said he had}} obtained a job in Chicago outside of football. [...] Elliott also considered going into medicine as his father had done, but he chose instead to go into coaching. [...] He started his coaching career at Michigan in the fall of 1948 as assistant backfield coach. [...] In the spring of 1949, he was hired as an assistant coach under Kip Taylor at Oregon State, where he remained for three seasons, from 1949–1951. [...] Elliott later recalled, [...] "I was only 24 when Kip Taylor hired me as backfield coach at Oregon State, and it bothered me a little because there were two backs on the squad who were older than I was." [...] It was even worse for his brother Pete, who was 22 when he was hired to coach the ends. [...] Bump recalled: [...] "After practice one night some players noticed Pete light up a cigaret. [...] One of his ends drew Pete aside and said in a fatherly voice, 'You shouldn't smoke, coach; I didn't do <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> your age." [...] Oregon State had an overall record of 14–15 in Elliott's three years as an assistant coach.|$|E
500|$|Since Carey {{intended}} #1's {{to serve}} as a sign of gratitude to her fans, the album contained four new songs not previously included on her albums. The first was a cover of Rainy Davis' [...] "Sweetheart" [...] (1987) performed as a duet with co-producer and rapper Jermaine Dupri. Dupri had worked with Carey in the past, contributing to her album Daydream, and co-produced several hip-hop remixes of her songs. Carey said of the inspiration for its recording, [...] "I was thinking of the old songs I used to listen to when I was in school. It's a really cute record. Young girls'll like it the way I liked <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> growing up." [...] Another new song featured on #1's was [...] "When You Believe", which Carey said was included because she felt it was [...] "a miracle" [...] that she and Houston collaborated on a record. During the development of All That Glitters, Carey had been introduced to DreamWorks producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who asked her if she would record the song [...] "When You Believe" [...] for the soundtrack to the animated film The Prince of Egypt. Carey and Houston were shown the film separately, and both became very enthusiastic about participating in the project. In an interview with MTV, Carey made the following statement regarding [...] "When You Believe" [...] and working with Whitney Houston: ...|$|E

500|$|Beginning {{early in}} 1968, the group largely retired from touring, instead {{focusing}} on {{work in the}} studio. As the band was not available to promote their material, subsequent releases met with little success. The Kinks' next single, [...] "Wonderboy", released {{in the spring of}} 1968, stalled at number 36 and became the band's first single not to make the UK Top Twenty since their early covers. In the face of the band's declining popularity, Davies continued to pursue his personal song-writing style while rebelling against the heavy demands placed on him to keep producing commercial hits, and the group continued to devote time to the studio, centring on a slowly developing project of Ray's called Village Green. In an attempt to revive the group's commercial standing, the Kinks' management booked them on a month-long package tour for April, drawing the group away from the studio. The venues were largely cabarets and clubs; headlining was Peter Frampton's group The Herd. [...] "In general, the teenyboppers were not there to see the boring old Kinks, who occasionally had to endure chants of 'We Want The Herd!' during their brief appearances", commented Andy Miller. The tour proved taxing and stressful—Pete Quaife recalled, [...] "It was a chore, very dull, boring and straightforward... We only did twenty minutes, but it used to drive me absolutely frantic, standing on stage and playing three notes over and over again." [...] At the end of June, the Kinks released the single [...] "Days", which provided a minor, but only momentary, comeback for the group. [...] "I remember playing <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at Fortis Green the first time I had a tape of it", Ray said. [...] "I played it to Brian, who used to be our roadie, and his wife and two daughters. They were crying at the end of it. Really wonderful—like going to Waterloo and seeing the sunset.... It's like saying goodbye to somebody, then afterwards feeling the fear that you actually are alone." [...] "Days" [...] reached number 12 in the United Kingdom and was a Top 20 hit in several other countries, but it did not chart in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|He also {{received}} media flak for mocking Chinese people when interviewed about newcomer center Yao Ming. O'Neal told a reporter, [...] "you tell Yao Ming, ching chong yang, wah, ah so." [...] O'Neal later {{said it was}} locker room humor and he meant no offense. Yao believed that O'Neal was joking, but he {{said a lot of}} Asians wouldn't see the humor. Yao joked, [...] "Chinese is hard to learn. I had trouble with <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> little." [...] O'Neal later admitted that he regretted how he hazed Yao early in his career.|$|E
2500|$|In Howard's last election, he was {{defeated}} in the Seat of Bennelong by Labor candidate Maxine McKew, who had hosted Lateline during the Howard era. Peter Mares reported for Radio National that [...] "some wags described it as an 'internal promotion', while others said she'd simply moved from the 'media wing' to the 'political wing' of the ALP". Mares consulted ABC journalist turned NSW Liberal MLA Pru Goward who said: [...] " [...] I have no doubt there was left-wing bias, I certainly thought <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there", while McKew {{said there was no}} left wing bias, though [...] "what I detected years ago in the ABC, much more of a collectivist philosophy".|$|E
6000|$|The child {{turned and}} looked at her, {{studying}} her face, and then with heightened colour and with something like indignation in her tone, she replied: [...] "That is my name! Why should <b>I</b> not tell <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> asked?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She loves, {{however, the}} scarf of the butterflies, and begs often to possess <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> taken she may do as she desires with it, for it {{will then be}} her own, to {{treasure}} or to resign unto strangers.|$|R

2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{thinking}} behind his {{change of name}} when he converted to Islam he stated that he was [...] "latching on to something {{that was part of}} my heritage, because many of the slaves who were brought here were Muslims. My family was brought to America by a French planter named Alcindor, who came here from Trinidad in the 18th century. My people were Yoruba, and their culture survived slavery... My father found out about that when I was a kid, and it gave me all I needed to know that, hey, I was somebody, even if nobody else knew about <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a kid, no one would believe anything positive that you could say about black people. And that's a terrible burden on black people, because they don't have an accurate idea of their history, which has been either suppressed or distorted." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark Foster {{graduated}} from Nordonia High School {{in the suburbs}} of Cleveland, Ohio. At his father's encouragement, Foster moved in with his uncle in Sylmar, Los Angeles, California to pursue a career in music. Foster worked various jobs and at night, he attended parties in Hollywood to expand his social network. He said, [...] "I felt like an 18-year-old Hunter S. Thompson. I was just diving into this Hollywood Hills subculture and taking it all in. I wasn't shy about taking my guitar out at a party. I wanted {{to be the center of}} attention." [...] At one time, he roomed with actor Brad Renfro. Foster struggled with drug addiction during his initial years in Los Angeles, saying, [...] "It got pretty dark. My friends thought I was going to die. I was blind to <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 19 years old, it got to a point where I said, 'Enough is enough' ... I saw time was just passing me by. I wasn't being productive." ...|$|E
2500|$|On day 2, Allan's 1984 diary was {{delivered}} to Carman's junior counsel and used against Allan in cross examination. The notebook contained details of Allan's sexual fantasies about a married Italian airline pilot named Ricardo and it cast doubt on her professed celibacy. Allan told the court that her relationship with Ricardo only included [...] "a degree of sexual foreplay". The judge said that any finding that Allan had lied {{about the extent of}} this relationship did not mean she had an affair with Terre'Blanche, whom she described as [...] "a very different man". The diary's disappearance was investigated by the police, but {{it was found that the}} diary had been left in the home of an English couple with whom Allan had resided in 1989. Allan revealed [...] "I was in a traumatic state and I wrote down my worst fears and probably my worst desires," [...] continuing [...] "It was a way of dealing with my sexual problems. [...] This notebook is deeply embarrassing. I wrote <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> under psychiatric care." [...] Later her former husband Gordon Schachat provided evidence supporting claims Allan had made about her disinterest in sex and citing it as a reason for the breakdown of their marriage. Schachat also rebuffed perceptions in the media about her image: [...] "her sexy public image is totally at odds with her real personality", continuing to describe her as [...] "shy". He insisted she was neither an extreme right-winger or anti-semitic.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{get some}} country girl {{to take care}} of <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> busy," [...] he said, [...] "and {{the rest of the time}} I'll attend to it myself.

6000|$|... "It ain’t what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a boy," [...] quavered the old man, {{filling his}} pipe with {{trembling}} fingers.
