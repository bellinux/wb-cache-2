500|$|Hitler {{had a few}} brief {{relationships}} when young. He {{was deeply}} attached to his half-niece Geli Raubal, 19 years his junior. She began living at his residence after her mother became Hitler's housekeeper in 1925. Although the exact {{nature and extent of}} their relationship is unknown, Kershaw describes it as a latent [...] "sexual dependence". It was rumoured among contemporaries that they were in a romantic relationship. Geli committed suicide with Hitler's gun in his Munich apartment in September 1931. Her death was a source of deep, lasting pain for Hitler. Ernst Hanfstaengl, {{one of the members of}} Hitler's inner circle in the early years in Munich, wrote that [...] "I felt Hitler was a case of a man who was neither <b>fish,</b> <b>flesh</b> nor fowl, neither fully homosexual nor fully heterosexual... I had formed the firm conviction that he was impotent, the repressed, masturbating type." [...] Nevertheless, Hanfstaengl was convinced enough of Hitler's heterosexuality that he unsuccessfully tried to encourage a romantic relationship between Hitler and Martha Dodd, daughter of the American ambassador. According to Hanfstaengl, filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl tried to begin a relationship with Hitler early on, but he turned her down.|$|E
2500|$|Laksam, [...] {{also known}} in Thailand as Lasae (...) , a {{speciality}} of the Northeastern Malaysian states of Kelantan, Terengganu and Kedah, {{is made with}} very thick flat white rice flour noodles in a rich, full-bodied white gravy of boiled fish and coconut milk. Though usually made of <b>fish</b> <b>flesh,</b> it is sometimes made with eels. Traditionally Laksa is eaten with hands rather than with eating utensils due to the gravy's thick consistency.|$|E
25|$|Big-game {{fishing is}} fishing from boats to catch large open-water {{species such as}} tuna, sharks, and marlin. Sport fishing (sometimes game fishing) is {{recreational}} fishing where the primary reward is the challenge of finding and catching the fish rather than the culinary or financial value of the <b>fish's</b> <b>flesh.</b> <b>Fish</b> sought after include marlin, tuna, tarpon, sailfish, shark, mackerel, and many others.|$|R

2500|$|The hook {{point is}} {{probably}} {{the most important part of}} the hook. It is the point that must penetrate <b>fish</b> <b>flesh</b> and secure the fish. The profile of the hook point and its length influence how well the point penetrates. The barb influences how far the point penetrates, how much pressure is required to penetrate and ultimately the holding power of the hook. Hook points are mechanically (ground) or chemically sharpened. Some hooks are barbless. Historically, many ancient fish hooks were barbless, but today a barbless hook is used to make hook removal and fish release less stressful on the fish. Hook points are also described relative to their offset from the hook shank. A kirbed hook point is offset to the left, a straight point has no offset and a reversed point is offset to the right.|$|E
2500|$|Edson left Charleston for New York in 1927 in {{an attempt}} to revive his career, but his recent {{publishing}} failure and long absence from the city undermined his efforts. Times were changing as well, and his style of writing was losing its appeal. He earned some money by ghostwriting the story of prize fighter Abe the Newsboy. The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy was published in 1930 and still in print in 1960, but Edson received no royalties. By the end of his final stay in New York, Edson was destitute. Robert Marks reported to a mutual acquaintance: “I feel sorry as hell for old Edson. I’ve seen him fairly often, and while I like him a lot I think he’s pretty hopeless. He is neither <b>fish,</b> <b>flesh,</b> fowl, nor good red herring. He has made enemies of everyone, has no practical sense, and little social poise.” ...|$|E

This spiking is called the ike jime process, and the instantaneous death means that the <b>fish's</b> <b>flesh</b> contains a minimal amount of lactic acid. This means that the fish will keep fresh on ice for about ten days, without turning white or otherwise degrading.|$|R

50|$|Adult {{tapeworms}} may infect humans, canids, felines, bears, pinnipeds, and mustelids, {{though the}} accuracy of the records for some of the nonhuman species is disputed. Immature eggs are passed in feces of the mammal host (the definitive host, where the worms reproduce). After ingestion by a suitable freshwater crustacean such as a copepod (the first intermediate host), the coracidia develop into procercoid larvae. Following ingestion of the copepod by a suitable second intermediate host, typically a minnow or other small freshwater fish, the procercoid larvae are released from the crustacean and migrate into the <b>fish's</b> <b>flesh</b> where they develop into a plerocercoid larvae (sparganum).
