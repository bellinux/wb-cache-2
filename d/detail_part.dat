Chapters 239 through 244 form a gaiden set before the Naruto manga and <b>detail</b> <b>part</b> of Kakashi Hatake's history. All subsequent chapters are considered to be part of the Part II storyline. Naruto is published in individual chapters by Shueisha in Weekly Shōnen Jump and is later collected in tankōbon format with various extras. While the series started serialization in issue 43 of 1999, Part II started in issue 19 of 2005. Volume 28, the first volume of Part II, was released on June 3, 2005, while volume 48 was released on November 4, 2009.|$|E

50|$|In 1877 {{she married}} again, to Elmer A. Thayer of Massachusetts, {{who was a}} manager for hotels on the Denver and Rio Grande lines. They moved to Chicago, Illinois, where she {{continued}} {{her career as a}} painter. With Thayer, she had two more children, both of whom died rather young (before 1899). In 1882, they moved to Colorado, where she shifted from figure painting to botanical art, focusing on wild flowers native to America depicted in natural settings. Her first book was Wild Flowers of Colorado (1885), illustrated with 24 chromolithographs of her watercolors accompanying a description of her travels throughout the state. It was followed two years later by Wild Flowers of the Pacific Coast, which was similarly framed around a travel narrative. The flowers in both books are painted in a lively, impressionistic style without great attention to scientific <b>detail.</b> <b>Part</b> of the appeal of Thayer's books stemmed from the first-person, diaristic style she used to recount her camping trips and mild adventures in pursuit of unusual flowers in sometimes rugged terrain. In her book on Colorado wild flowers, Thayer {{was the first person to}} report that giant helleborine can be found in that state.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1999 The {{life cycle}} cost of a single <b>detail</b> <b>part</b> in a large {{assembly}} such as an airframe includes design, tooling, manufacture, maintenance and other associated computing overhead throughout the 40 year life of the part. These expenses are {{a significant factor in}} the final cost of the assembled product. As such, opportunities exist in preliminary design to identify and exploit existing "similar parts" that are already configured in the release system. The notion of a similar part properties includes geometric parameters as well as other non-geometric attributes such as material and finish. This dissertation is based on an 8 -dimensional hyperspace where the axes of the space represent an appropriate set of the <b>detail</b> <b>part</b> properties discussed above. Thus, any given <b>detail</b> <b>part</b> can be mapped directly into this space. In this domain, the concept of similar part discovery reduces to identifying an appropriate neighborhood around a given target location. This dissertation develops "shaped neighborhoods" in hyperspace using a neural network based vector approach. The method provides the required flexibility to define highly specific neighborhoods which in turn yield highly refined search results. Put another way, these 8 -dimensional shaped neighborhoods, called "cookie cutters", provide the means for defining individual property variability as a simultaneous function of all other property variability. Finally, an improved NN training algorithm specifically suited to the network topology used to represent the shaped neighborhoods is presented. In this algorithm, Kohonen self-organizing feature maps (SOFM) are used to define a topology preserving mapping between a high dimensional NN input space and a two dimensional output map space. NN training error is associated with respective SOFM map nodes. Thus, the Kohonen map nodes represent vector prototypes over the input domain and the values associated with each map node are representative of training error for a generalized region in the input domain. This dissertation exploits this relationship by defining a weight update expression based on this error leading to an accelerated network convergence algorithm...|$|E
