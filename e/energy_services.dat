This report complements the sector for Germany within the BARRIERS project (Sorrell et al., 2000; Schleich/Boede 2000 a; Schleich/Boede 2000 b; Schleich et al., 2000). The report characterises the German <b>energy</b> <b>service</b> sector, contains a description and analysis of four case studies in the <b>energy</b> <b>service</b> sector, identifies the main barriers and chances for ESCOs in the higher education, brewery and mechanical engineering sectors, and concludes with brief recommendations on how these barriers may be overcome.

40|$|International audienceTradable White Certificates (TWC) schemes, also {{labelled}} Energy-Efficiency Certificates schemes, {{were recently}} implemented in Great Britain, Italy and France. Energy suppliers have {{to fund a}} given quantity of energy efficiency measures, or to buy so-called "white certificates" from other suppliers who exceed their target. We develop a partial equilibrium model to compare TWC schemes to other policy instruments for energy efficiency, i. e., energy taxes, subsidies on energy-saving goods and regulations fixing a minimum level of energy-efficiency.
