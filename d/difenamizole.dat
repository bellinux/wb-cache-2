50|$|<b>Difenamizole</b> (INN) (brand name Pasalin; former {{developmental}} {{code name}} AP-14) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and analgesic of the pyrazolone group related to metamizole. It has monoaminergic properties, including inhibition of monoamine oxidase, augmentation of pargyline-induced elevation of striatal dopamine levels, inhibition of K+-induced striatal dopamine release, and inhibition of the reuptake of dopamine.|$|E
30|$|Pyrazoles form an {{integral}} part of many natural products of therapeutic importance and possess potentially reactive sites for a variety of chemical reactions to generate molecular diversity. (S)- 3 -Pyrazolylalanine [23], lonazolac [24], <b>difenamizole</b> [25], mepirizole [26], metamizol [27] and 4, 5 -dihydro- 3 -phenyl- 6 H-pyrrolo[1, 2 -b]pyrazole are some of the biologically active compounds endowed with antimicrobial [28], hypoglycaemic [29] and non-nucleoside HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor properties [30].|$|E
40|$|Pyrazole and its {{derivatives}} {{are considered}} a pharmacologically important active scaffold that possesses almost all types of pharmacological activities. The presence of this nucleus in pharmacological agents of diverse therapeutic categories such as celecoxib, a potent anti-inflammatory, the antipsychotic CDPPB, the anti-obesity drug rimonabant, <b>difenamizole,</b> an analgesic, betazole, a H 2 -receptor agonist and the antidepressant agent fezolamide have proved the pharmacological potential of the pyrazole moiety. Owing to this diversity in the biological field, this nucleus has {{attracted the attention of}} many researchers to study its skeleton chemically and biologically. This review highlights the different synthesis methods and the pharmacological properties of pyrazole derivatives. Studies on the synthesis and biological activity of pyrazole derivatives developed by many scientists around the globe are reported...|$|E
