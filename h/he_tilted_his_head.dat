6000|$|He was {{presently}} almost cool, and {{his eyes}} got more used to the rush of air, but he was getting very high, very high. <b>He</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> forwards and surveyed the country, blinking. He could see all over Buffalo, a place with three great blackened scars of ruin, and hills and stretches beyond. He {{wondered if he was}} half a mile high, or more. There were some people among some houses near a railway station between Niagara and Buffalo, and then more people. They went like ants busily {{in and out of the}} houses. He saw two motor cars gliding along the road towards Niagara city. Then far away in the south he saw a great Asiatic airship going eastward. [...] "Oh, Gord!" [...] he said, and became earnest in his ineffectual attempts to alter his direction. But that airship took no notice of him, and he continued to ascend convulsively. The world got more and more extensive and maplike. Click, clock, clitter-clock. Above him and very near to him now was a hazy stratum of cloud.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>he</b> stoops, <b>he</b> <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and looks}} up at the person he speaks to, rather than at eye level.|$|R
50|$|J.D.'s most {{prominently}} featured quirk is his habit of daydreaming. When this happens, <b>he</b> <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back {{and to his}} left, blankly looking upwards. The sequences played out in his daydreams are of surreal scenarios and situations that have just been mentioned or wondered about, often in an exaggerated manner. Many of these are followed by a comment from him which, although {{in keeping with his}} daydream, sounds strange and is often highly unrelated to the initial topic, very often earning him odd looks from nearby characters in the scene.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Eadweard Muybridge, pioneer of early action photography, 1872 - 1878. The portrait, taken fifteen years after Muybridge had successfully taken the famous photographic action series of Leland Stanford's horse, depicts the artist {{seated in a}} chair with his hands folded in his lap. He wears a suit and gazes to the left. His long white hair and beard are in disarray, his intense eyes set deep into <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and veiled in shadow. <b>He</b> <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to the side, making him look partially infirm or deranged. A note on the picture file card reads: "(Griffin?) "...|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Fecundo Reyes holding a horse-blanket, standing {{to the side}} of a shanty barn, [s. d]. Fecundo, the son of Clara Cota and Antonio Reyes, {{can be seen from the}} knees up standing at center. He holds a long swaddle of material which may be either a horse-blanket or cured animal skin. He wears a lightly-colored button-down shirt over which a dark vest is pulled. <b>He</b> <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slightly to the right, the brim of his hat tipped-up enough to expose his round, bearded face. He appears to be in late middle-life, possibly his late fifties or early sixties. Behind him, an unhitched horse-drawn carriage can be seen to the left, while farther back and to the right, a woman of similar age to Fecundo can be seen in a prairie dress. Behind her, the broad side of the ramshackle barn can be seen. Fecundo was also the grandson of Juan Francisco Reyes, the first grantee of the San Fernando Valley...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tilted</b> back <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{with a grunt}} that slid swiftly into a gurgle, and {{the shadow}} of a man's torso, monstrous beneath a huge {{inverted}} bottle, wavered and danced on the frown of the cliff at our backs. Palitlum released his lips from the glass with a caressing suck and glanced regretfully up into the ghostly vault of the sky where played the wan white light of the summer borealis.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy's {{skin was}} brown, {{his mouth was}} firm, and his look alert. His hands were {{blistered}} and his back was sore, {{but this was not}} important. He could now pull a big saw through gummy logs and, as a rule, drive the shining ax-head where he wanted it to go. A belt held his overalls tight at <b>his</b> waist; when <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> back <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to get <b>his</b> breath his balance and pose were good.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Peter J. Horsch {{standing on the}} roof of a building, ca. 1930. Horsch is shown in full figure at center, dressed in a pinstripe suit. <b>He</b> has <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slightly towards the left, and his hips are angled slightly to the right. His left hand is partly clenched, while the other hangs open. The brick walls of the building's roof are visible in the background, while a drain is visible near Horsch's feet. He retired from the Title Insurance Company in 1950. He appears to be in his early fifties...|$|R
5000|$|On-stage Strummer wires {{himself up}} into an inhuman dynamo of sweaty, {{trembling}} flesh, fearful {{enough to have}} one wondering when the ambulance brigade will rush to his rescue with a straight-jacket. While <b>he</b> <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> bullet <b>head</b> at acute angles, his agonising face screwed into an open wound, he wields his Telecaster like a chain saw. His magnetism is totally original - more like an Olympic strong man imploding all his energy into a final record-breaking lift than anything seen on a rock'n'roll stage before. Off-stage, he's the Clash member with the lowest profile. —Caroline Coon ...|$|R
500|$|Before {{becoming}} involved with The Lion King, Deja had already {{developed a reputation}} for animating Disney villains. Prior to animating Scar, Deja had just recently served as the supervising animator of Gaston and Jafar, the villains in Disney's Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992), respectively. Initially, Deja had been considering the idea of animating a hero {{as opposed to a}} villain for a change, contemplating taking on the task of animating Simba instead. However, Deja soon relented upon learning that Scar would be voiced by Irons, feeling that it would be [...] "fun" [...] to animate a character voiced by such a prestigious actor. Meanwhile, Minkoff and Allers had already had Deja in mind for animating Scar long before the animator approached the directors about the position. The level anthropomorphism used in The Lion King exceeded that of any Disney animated film by which it was preceded. Because Scar is an animal as opposed to a human, Deja and the animators experienced certain challenges and limitations when it came to instilling movement in the character, and thus experimented with manipulating Scar's facial expressions, specifically the way in which <b>he</b> <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> condescendingly, raises <b>his</b> eyebrows and lifts his chin. The animals were each drawn with certain human-like attributes and characteristics in order to help convey emotions and tell the story. Meanwhile, the studio recruited live lions for the animators to study while drawing. As the film's villain, Scar is the only lion drawn with claws.|$|R
500|$|Much of the {{gameplay}} {{consists of}} navigating {{the town and}} finding keys or other items to bypass doors or other obstructions, with less focus on killing enemies. Occasionally puzzles will be presented, often with riddles left for the player to interpret. The difficulty levels of the enemies and the puzzles are determined independently by the player before starting the game. James keeps a radio with him, which alerts him {{to the presence of}} creatures by emitting static, allowing him to detect them even through the thick fog. <b>He</b> also <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{in the direction of a}} nearby item or monster. For combat, he finds three melee weapons and three firearms over the course of the game, with another two melee weapons unlocked during replays. [...] "Health" [...] restoratives and ammunition can be found throughout the game.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm glad to {{come back}} alive, anyway," [...] said Jeff, with a joviality new to Westover. [...] "I tell you, there a'n't many places finer than old Lion's Head, after all. Don't you think so, Mr. Westover? I {{want to get the}} {{daylight}} on it, but it does well by moonlight, even." [...] He looked round at the tall girl, who had been lingering to hear the talk of planchette; at the backward <b>tilt</b> <b>he</b> gave <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> to get her in range, she frowned as if she felt his words a betrayal, and slipped out of the room; the boy had already gone, and was making himself heard in the low room overhead.|$|R
6000|$|... "One day I met {{him on the}} {{footpath}} {{over the}} Talfourd Hill. He told me that 'women were funny.' I had heard already of domestic differences. People were saying that Amy Foster was beginning {{to find out what}} sort of man she had married. He looked upon the sea with indifferent, unseeing eyes. His wife had snatched the child out of his arms one day as he sat on the doorstep crooning to it a song such as the mothers sing to babies in his mountains. She seemed to think he was doing it some harm. Women are funny. And she had objected to him praying aloud in the evening. Why? He expected the boy to repeat the prayer aloud after him by-and-by, as he used to do after his old father when he was a child--in his own country. And I discovered he longed for their boy to grow up so that he could have a man to talk with in that language that to our ears sounded so disturbing, so passionate, and so bizarre. Why his wife should dislike the idea he couldn't tell. But that would pass, <b>he</b> said. And <b>tilting</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> knowingly, <b>he</b> tapped his breastbone to indicate that she had a good heart: not hard, not fierce, open to compassion, charitable to the poor! ...|$|R
60|$|Arthur, however, {{happened}} to be in no hurry. <b>He</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> hat on the back of <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and leaned upon the table.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> straw hat, and {{scratched}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{for a few}} minutes, puffing the while immense clouds of smoke, to the inexpressible delight of the open-mouthed youngsters around him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> eyes toward heaven in mute ecstasy. I understood.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} the {{powerful}} animal struggled so violently that <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> prison on one side, and well-nigh overturned it.|$|R
60|$|The Personage had <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> so {{far back}} that, {{in order to}} keep the Assistant Commissioner under his observation, he had to nearly close his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Summerlee {{had been}} so {{interested}} that he had stood unresisting while Challenger <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> into the air. Now he shook his colleague off {{and came back to}} his dignity.|$|R
6000|$|His lordship {{stared at}} her again. Then he half-closed his large, pale eyes, and <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> a little. [...] "I wonder why you hate him so," [...] he said softly.|$|R
6000|$|Braile stared hard at him. Then <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> chair {{down and}} came to the edge of his porch, and called in cruel mockery, [...] "Why, God, is that you?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{thrust his}} hands in his trouser-pockets and, {{spreading}} his legs wide apart, <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back and blew smoke to the ceiling. He was in the same easy position when Ethel arrived home accompanied by Mr. Potter.|$|R
60|$|Smoke nodded, {{bending over}} the corpse, {{twisting}} it half up to face them, and {{pointing to a}} bullet wound in the temple. He glanced {{to the side and}} <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at a revolver that lay on top of the snow.|$|R
60|$|The Assistant Commissioner paused, then added: “Those fellows are {{a perfect}} pest.” In order {{to raise his}} {{drooping}} glance to the speaker’s face, the Personage on the hearthrug had gradually <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> farther back, which gave him an aspect of extraordinary haughtiness.|$|R
60|$|The {{satisfaction}} in the shrouded face was still plainer. The man tried to mumble out some words--could not succeed; tried to express something with his obstructed hands--failed; paused a moment, then feebly <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> in a meaning way, toward the corpse that lay nearest him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah,' said Merton. 'Then let us talk {{as between}} man and man.' <b>He</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> chair backwards, and crossed his legs. 'By the way, as I have no Aaron and Hur to help me to hold up my hands, may I drop them? The attitude, though reassuring, is fatiguing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did it ruffle his pretty hair, then!" [...] she cried; and, {{with her}} hair-comb, she combed him straight. [...] "And his nice little moustache!" [...] she exclaimed. She <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back and combed his young moustache. [...] "It's a wicked moustache, 'Postle," [...] she said. [...] "It's a red for danger. Have {{you got any}} of those cigarettes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would like}} to know who the Deuce you are?" [...] said Chaffery, {{suddenly}} <b>tilting</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back so as to look through his glasses instead of over them, and laughing genially. [...] "For thoroughgoing Cheek, I'm inclined to think you take the Cake. Are you the Mr. Lewisham to whom this misguided girl refers in her letter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True, drink is a {{pleasant}} delight," [...] said Jan, {{as one who}} repeated a truism so familiar to his brain that he hardly noticed its passage over his tongue; and, lifting the cup, Coggan <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> gradually backwards, with closed eyes, that his expectant soul might not be diverted for one instant from its bliss by irrelevant surroundings.|$|R
60|$|Sir Ethelred shifted {{one hand}} under his coat tails, and <b>tilting</b> back <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{looked at him}} steadily.|$|R
60|$|Lingard {{burst into}} a loud laugh which ended shortly in a deep sigh. <b>He</b> closed <b>his</b> eyes, <b>tilting</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{over the back of}} his armchair; and on his face, baked by the unclouded suns of many hard years, there {{appeared}} for a moment a weariness and a look of age which startled Almayer, like an unexpected disclosure of evil.|$|R
25|$|Maxwell House's 'hug-a-mug' 80's TV {{commercials}} sometimes featured cartoon Dick Tracy cameos, {{including one}} {{where he is}} sitting at a live action diner counter along with some live action cops. As Tracy raises his coffee mug, his wrist radio sounds. <b>He</b> <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> wrist to listen, {{only to have the}} coffee spill to the amusement of the cops.|$|R
50|$|When {{the male}} begins to display, he erects the {{feathers}} {{of his throat}} and sides to accentuate the bright colours of his plumage in the shafts of sunlight that pierce the dimness of the rainforest. He curves his rounded wings above <b>his</b> body and <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back to expose his chin and throat to the light, and then moves {{from side to side}} in a fashion that looks almost mechanical.|$|R
50|$|One study {{described}} {{a patient with}} astasis as lying {{in bed with a}} normal body posture. When the patient was sitting, <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> body to the left. When he was asked to stand up, the patient rotated his trunk axis to the left (left shoulder going backwards), and <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> body to that same side, showing resistance to passive correction of posture in both of these planes. He was unable to stand and fell backwards and towards the left.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} Miss Haldin got up abruptly. I was glad. He did not evidently expect {{anything}} so decisive and, at first, throwing <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back, <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> up <b>his</b> dark glasses with bland curiosity. At last, recollecting himself, {{he stood up}} hastily, seizing his hat off his knees with great adroitness.|$|R
60|$|Corny Kelleher {{closed his}} long daybook and glanced with his {{drooping}} eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning {{it on its}} axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by {{and came to the}} doorway. There <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.|$|R
