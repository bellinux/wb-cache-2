This material was sealed in Polythene bags, filling them to the maximum, and irradiated in a Co 60 γ-cell at ca. 18 °C with 0 · 50, 0 · 75 and 1 · 0 Mrad respectively. Bacteriological examinations made ca. 72 hr after irradiation revealed that 0 · 50 Mrad secured final counts of Salm. binza below 1 / 25 g (corresponding to ca. six decimal reductions), while 1 · 0 Mrad reduced viable counts of the spores used to less than 10 /g (i. e. four decimal reductions). The latter dose also reduced numbers of naturally present viable Lancefield group D streptococci by at least three factors of ten. No significant losses of available lysin occurred {{in any of the}} materials at any tested dose of γ-irradiation. Autoxidative changes in the lipid fraction of the materials were noticed in <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> <b>only,</b> but even there solely at dosages ≥ 0 · 75 Mrad and limited to about a 100 per cent increase in peroxide value.

Pigs were randomly allotted to pens at weaning (d 0) and were fed a common starter diet for 7 d. On d 7, pens of pigs were randomly allotted by BW to 1 of 7 dietary treatments (10 pens/treatment and 5 pigs/pen) in a 2 × 3 + 1 factorial. Diets were corn-soybean meal-based that contained 10 % dried whey and none (Control) or 3 or 6 % fish meal from 1 of 3 sources (IPC 790 Fish Meal, The Scoular Company, Minneapolis, MN; Special Select Menhaden Fish Meal, Omega Proteins, Houston, TX; and Daybrook LT Prime Menhaden Fish Meal, Daybrook Fisheries, Morristown, NJ). All fish meal sources were from the 2014 catch year. All samples of fish meal contained less than 0. 15 % total volatile N suggesting high quality. A source × level interaction (P < 0. 05) for ADG and final BW was observed as increasing levels of IPC 790 improved ADG; however, pigs fed Special Select and LT Prime <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> <b>only</b> saw improvement when 3 % was included. While no differences were observed between treatments for ADFI, there was a source × level interaction for G:F (Linear P = 0. 005). This was a result of G:F linearly improving as IPC 790 increased, with pigs fed 3 % Special Select or LT Prime having similar performance to 6 % IPC 790, but no further improvement thereafter.

40|$|ABSTRACT Three {{experiments}} were {{conducted for the}} purpose of determining the effect of feeding isoenergetic diets with and without <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> or its fractions on hepatic lipid deposition in estrogenized chicks. The chicks were fasted for 48 hr before being fed the experimental diets and were injected with estradiol three times during the experiment. After 4 days, hepatic lipid content was determined. In the first experiment, the quantity of hepatic lipid deposited per unit of liver and per 100 g body weight was significantly less for chicks fed 10 % <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> and an ethanol ex-tract of <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> equivalent to 10 % than for chicks fed an unsupplemented corn-soy diet. In a second experiment a significant reduction in hepatic lipids deposited per 100 g body weight was observed with 10 % <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> but <b>only</b> a numerical reduction with ethanol extracts of <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> equivalent to 10 or 20 % and the ash of ethanol extract equivalent to 20 %. In a third experiment a highly significant reduction in hepatic lipid deposition was observed in birds refed a diet containing <b>fish</b> <b>meal,</b> alfalfa, and torula yeast but feeding this before the starvation-refeeding period did not affect liver lipids.

The dietary nitrogen supplied by <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> was replaced by increasing dietary proportions of torula yeast (0, 7. 5, 15, 30, 60 and 100 %). Nitrogen stable isotope values (δ 15 N) were measured in ingredients, diets and muscle tissue of experimental animals in order to estimate the relative contributions of dietary nitrogen and dry matter supplied by both ingredients. At {{the end of a}} 29 d bioassay, {{there were no significant differences}} in survival rate among treatments. Shrimps fed on all diets containing torula yeast and <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> had higher growth rates (k = 0. 059 - 0. 064) than animals fed on diets containing <b>only</b> <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> or <b>only</b> torula yeast (k = 0. 041 - 0. 054). Incorporation of δ 15 N values of ingredients and muscle tissue into an isotopic mixing model indicated that the relative incorporation of dietary nitrogen and total dry matter from torula yeast to growth consistently increased in relation to increasing proportions of this ingredient in the experimental diets. The only exception was the diet formulated with the highest yeast content (60 %, diet 40 F/ 60 T) where <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> contributed a higher proportion of dietary nitrogen to growth.

This report concerns a study to investigate the fate and survival of ingested GM soy DNA fragments (120 and 195 bp) and a 180 -bp fragment of the lectin gene of soybean (Glycine max) during feeding trials with Atlantic salmon post-smolt. Specifically, the study focused on the fate of selected GM soy DNA fragments from feed to fish to investigate their survival through the fish gastrointestinal (GI) tract and whether the DNA could be traced in a variety of fish tissues. Fish were fed three experimental diets for 6 weeks, which were formulated from defined components and represented either GM or non-GM materials (17. 2 % of the <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> was replaced with either GM or non-GM soy).

40|$|This {{research}} was aimed to compare quality of local <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> and imported ones, mainly {{in term of}} their effects on daily weight gain, feed efficiency, sexual performance, and semen production of Kacang goat bucks. Fifteen bucks were allotted to Randomized Block Design with three treatments and 5 replications. Treatment A was concentrate containing 14. 10 % soy bean meal and 0. 90 % urea, treatment B and C were concentrate containing 15 % of local and imported <b>fish</b> <b>meal,</b> respectively. Each buck was put in individual cage, fed on elephant grass ad libitum and the concentrate of 1. 50 % body weight. Variables measured were daily weight gain, feed efficiency, sexual performance, and semen production. Semen was collected twice a week for 8 weeks. The results showed that feeding concentrate either containing local <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> (treatment B) or imported <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> (treatment C) gave no significantly different effect on daily weight gain, feed efficiency, sexual performance, and semen production. However both treatments gave better effect on the variables than those feeding concentrate containing soy bean meal and urea (treatment A). Based on these results, it could be concluded that quality of local <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> was {{not significantly different from}} imported ones. Thus, {{it can be used to}} argue the perception of <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> consumers that quality of local <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> is lower than imported ones.

Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) fed <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> that evoked black vomit disease in chickens reportedly developed gastric lesions, but {{the role of}} thermal abuse and histamine content {{in the formation of}} ulcerogenic compounds had not been fully elucidated. The effects of dietary histamine and heat treatment on feed palatability, protein quality, and gastric abnormalities were evaluated in feeding trials with juvenile rainbow trout. No correlation was found between feeding behavior and feed intake by rainbow trout and the results of toxicity bioassays with chickens. Palatability of nontoxic <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> and casein was improved by histamine supplementation (0 vs. 2, 000 mg/kg dry diet) and heat treatment. Free histamine in unheated <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> was slightly repellent. Histamine and heat treatment of casein or of two other sources of <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> had minimal effect on feed intake. No correlation was found between the nutritional quality of <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> protein to juvenile rainbow trout and the results of toxicity bioassays with chickens. Protein retention and growth was similar among groups of fish pair-fed diets containing <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> either acutely toxic of nontoxic to chickens. Protein retention and fish growth was not interactively affected by histamine supplementation (0, 500, 1, 000, 1, 500, or 2, 000 mg/kg dry diet) and heat treatment of nontoxic <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> or casein. <b>Fish</b> fed toxic Chilean <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> for 111 d had distended stomachs, but no lesions or cellular abnormalities were observed. Similar effects were obtained by histamine supplementation (2, 000 mg/kg dry diet) and heat treatment of nontoxic <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> and casein. Histamine toxicity was not affected by addition of two suspected potentiators, putrescine and cadaverine. These studies showed that the results of chicken bioassays cannot be used to predict <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> palatability and nutritional quality to rainbow trout. <b>Fish</b> <b>meals</b> acutely toxic to chickens are not acutely toxic to rainbow trout, and chronic dietary exposure results in stomach distention without reductions in feed intake or fish growth rates...|$|R

The effective degradability of dry matter and the crude protein of <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> was significantly lower than cottonseed meal (p&lt; 0. 05). In different concentrates, {{there was no significant}} difference in effective degradability of dry matter but with the increase of <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> the effective degradability of crude protein decreased significantly. In the second experiment, the eight multiparous Holstein cows with the similar milk production (25. 37 ± 0. 85) were examined in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with the 21 -day period. There were no significant differences between the treatments in digestibility of OM, OM and CP, the dry matter intake, 3. 2 % FCM, milk fat (%), milk lactose (%), milk total solid (%), and the yield of the milk fat, feed efficiency and body weights.

40|$|A four-week {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of partially or completely withdrawing <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> from broiler finisher diets on growth performance and carcass yield. In a completely randomized design, ninety six (96) four-week-old Marshall Breed of broilers were allotted to four dietary treatments having 0, 50, 75 and 100 % of their fishmeal content withdrawn. Each dietary treatment had 24 birds with 3 replicates of 8 birds. Results show that initial weights, final weights, average daily feed intake, average daily weight gain, feed conversion ratio and feed cost per kilogram gain were not negatively affected (P> 0. 05) by levels of <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> withdrawal. Dressing percentages were also not significantly different (P> 0. 05) between treatment means. However, the percent carcass cut-up parts of breast, wings, thighs and drumsticks to live weight of birds fed diets with <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> totally withdrawn were significantly less (P< 0. 05) than those of birds fed diets containing <b>fish</b> <b>meal.</b> From this study, it can be concluded that withdrawing <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> from broiler finisher diets may not have any adverse effect on their growth performance provided protein is obtained from non-animal sources. However, total withdrawal of <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> negatively affects optimum development of the cut-up parts and as such 0. 5 - 1 % <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> may be included in broiler finisher diets for full development of carcass components...|$|R
40|$|Mud crab culture {{relies heavily}} on trash fish as {{the main source of}} feed ingredients.  Artificial diets have been {{developed}} for mud crab and most of them have high content of <b>fish</b> <b>meal.</b> The increasing cost and demand of <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> has encouraged feed manufacture to search for cheaper alternative protein sources such as plant protein.  There is an urgent need to find suitable alternative protein sources to reduce the dependence of <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> in mud crab diet. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop compounded feeds for juvenile of mud crab with reduced <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> content, and as an alternative of trash fish feeding.

40|$|This paper {{reviewed}} fish catch {{production and}} estimated demand of aquafeed, <b>fish</b> <b>meal,</b> <b>fish</b> oil, soybean <b>meal</b> in Viet Nam for year 2013. Fish catch production was around 2. 8 {{million metric tons}} (mt) while marine fish production was 1. 9 million mt. Estimated marine trash fish production was 0. 8 million mt with over 100 species including the dominant species anchovy (Stolephorus spp.), lizard fish (Saurida spp.) and pony fish (Leistognathus spp.). Approximately 0. 5 million mt of marine trash fish was used for livestock, aquaculture and <b>fish</b> <b>meal.</b> Local marine <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> consisting of protein content from 50 to 68 % and catfish byproduct meal containing protein level from 50 to 60 % were available. Based on FCR values of 5 major species including catfish, black tiger shrimp, white leg shrimp, Asian seabass, and snake head, aquafeed production was estimated at around 2. 5 million mt. Marine fish oil/squid liver oil requirement was from 15. 5 to 31 thousand mt. <b>Fish</b> <b>meal</b> demand was from 252 and 430 thousand mt. Almost all <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> and marine <b>fish</b> oil used in aquafeed were imported. Moreover, soybean and other plant ingredients are potential alternative sources to replace <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> and <b>fish</b> oil. Vietnamese farmers produced 168 thousand mt soybean while soybean demand amounts for aquafeed were from 693 to 1, 140 thousand mt. In 2013, feedmills imported approximately 3 million mt of soybean meal (cake) from many countries in the world. Some other plant protein sources which were also imported, have good nutrient profiles but they contain some anti-nutritional factors. In the future, research on replacement of <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> and <b>fish</b> oil with plant and animal by-product sources and feed additives for aquafeed should be studied. In particular, the management of local <b>fish</b> <b>meal</b> plants and capture fishery should be improved...|$|R
