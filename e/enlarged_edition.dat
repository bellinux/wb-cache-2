5|$|Hoping to {{establish}} his credentials {{once and for all}} as an expert field naturalist, Ernest Thompson Seton spent several years of the controversy working diligently on his two-volume work Life-Histories of Northern Animals, which was published in 1909. After an <b>enlarged</b> <b>edition</b> of the book was published as Lives of Game Animals, Seton was ironically awarded the Burroughs Medal in 1927, a prize named after the venerable naturalist who had once so criticized Seton's work.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{importance}} of The Slave Community was recognized by scholars of American slavery, Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources were heavily criticized. Historians criticized the use of slave narratives that were seen as unreliable and biased. They questioned Blassingame's decision to exclude the more than 2,000 interviews with former slaves conducted by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s. Historians argued that Blassingame's use of psychological theory proved unhelpful in his interpretation. Blassingame defended his conclusions at a 1976 meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History and in 1979 published a revised and <b>enlarged</b> <b>edition</b> of The Slave Community. Despite criticisms, The Slave Community is a foundational text {{in the study of}} the life and culture of slaves in the antebellum South.|$|E

5|$|The {{first edition}} {{appeared}} in 1917 with 793 pages, published by Cambridge University Press. The second, <b>enlarged</b> <b>edition</b> appeared in 1942, with 1116 pages; it extended {{many of the}} chapters somewhat but did not significantly change Thompson's thesis. Since then it has been reprinted and abridged many times, including in 1943, 1944, 1945, 1948, 1951, 1952, 1959, 1961, 1963, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1977, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2014. It has thus been in print continuously since the Second World War. The book has been translated into German, Spanish, French, and Greek. The 1961 edition, skilfully abridged down to 346 pages by John Tyler Bonner, presents the essence of Thompson's argument.|$|E

25|$|Her first work A View of Religion, was {{published}} in 1784, and a second and <b>enlarged</b> <b>edition</b> in 1791. The emolument she derived from this not only placed her in a comfortable situation, but enabled her to pay the debts she had contracted during her and her sister's illness, and to lend a small sum at interest. In 1799, she published A Summary History of New England, from the settlement at Plymouth {{to the adoption of}} the Federal Constitution. In gathering materials for this work, among old manuscripts, she seriously impaired her eyesight, and had to employ an amanuensis to prepare the copy for the printers.
