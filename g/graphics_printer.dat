25|$|The early {{versions}} of Windows are {{often thought of}} as graphical shells, mostly because they ran on top of MS-DOS and use it for file system services. However, even the earliest Windows versions already assumed many typical operating system functions; notably, having their own executable file format and providing their own device drivers (timer, <b>graphics,</b> <b>printer,</b> mouse, keyboard and sound). Unlike MS-DOS, Windows allowed users to execute multiple graphical applications at the same time, through cooperative multitasking. Windows implemented an elaborate, segment-based, software virtual memory scheme, which allows it to run applications larger than available memory: code segments and resources are swapped in and thrown away when memory became scarce; data segments moved in memory when a given application had relinquished processor control.|$|E

50|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{peripherals}} were available that worked on {{some or all of}} these models. The first line, introduced with the 4010, included the 4610 Hard Copy Unit, a <b>graphics</b> <b>printer.</b> This used a system in the monitor to scan the display line-by-line which was then sent to the printer where a second one-line tall CRT duplicated the image on thermal paper. Normally selling for $3,550, a $3,950 version allowed the printer to be shared among four terminals. The adaptor could be pre-installed in the 4010, making it the 4010-1, and it came pre-installed on both the 4012 and 4013 which do not appear to have used the -1 notation to indicate this. The 4631 was a version of the 4610 with a sheet feeder and higher speed. A properly equipped 4014 could also drive a plotter through an expansion card, including the GPIB-based 4662 Interactive Digital Plotter and 4663 C-sized version. Plotters offered colored pen selection, which could be embedded in the graphics data.|$|E

50|$|Fine art digital inkjet {{printing}} is printing {{from a computer}} image file directly to an inkjet printer as a final output. It evolved from digital proofing technology from Kodak, 3M, and other major manufacturers, with artists and other printers trying to adapt these dedicated prepress proofing machines to fine-art printing. There was experimentation with many {{of these types of}} printers, the most notable being the IRIS printer, initially adapted to fine-art printing by programmer David Coons, and adopted for fine-art work by Graham Nash at his Nash Editions printing company in 1991. Initially, these printers were limited to glossy papers, but the IRIS <b>Graphics</b> <b>printer</b> allowed the use of a variety of papers that included traditional and non-traditional media. The IRIS printer was the standard for fine art digital printmaking for many years, and is still in use today, but has been superseded by large-format printers from other manufacturers such as Epson and HP that use fade-resistant, archival inks (pigment-based, as well as newer solvent-based inks), and archival substrates specifically designed for fine-art printing.|$|E

40|$|OZDRAW is an {{interactive}} figure generation {{system designed to}} operate on the IRIS 2400 workstations. The aim of OZDRAW {{is to provide a}} powerful, yet friendly, general purpose figure generation system to allow untrained users to produce high quality figures {{that can be used for}} presentations, technical papers and academic theses. OZDRAW has been designed so that the user can efficiently operate the system with little or no experience. The system uses pop-up menus to provide the user with the available instructions; menus use text rather than icons to provide an interface that is less ambiguous to the inexperienced user. The system requirements for OZDRAW are: (1) an IRIS 2400 workstation, ideally with three megabytes of memory and a floating-point accelerator, and (2) the IRIS mouse (3) a <b>graphics</b> <b>printer</b> capable of quality graphics production; a laser printer is the preferred printerThe work reported herein was supported by Contract from the Office of Naval Research.

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} account of works {{recently}} undertaken by the Department of Architecture of Mons Polytechnic School (Belgium) about a program of computer-assisted design. That program, written in FORTRAN, has been elaborated with the object of drawing perspective architectural scenes on digital plotters or <b>graphic</b> <b>printers</b> and of eliminating hidden lines from these scenes. Two algorithms, that yield good results for automatic search of observer's position in terms of orientation and for the computation of hidden lines in case of numerous segments and opaque surfaces, are presented. Some graphic examples are provided. An algorithm of previous classifying of segments and opaque surfaces is propounded. The precision of calculations and the magnitude of tolerances for parametric operations of comparison are discussed. The use of APL to introduce, modify or correct data is approached, in this way, a survey of potential application of APL for solid modelling is suggested...|$|R

40|$|The {{materials}} {{included in}} the Airborne Radiological Computer System, Model-II (ARCS-II) were assembled with several considerations in mind. First, the system was designed to measure and record the airborne gamma radiation levels and the corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates, {{and to provide a}} first overview look of the extent and severity of an accident's impact. Second, the portable system had to be light enough and durable enough that it could be mounted in an aircraft, ground vehicle, or watercraft. Third, the system must control the collection and storage of the data, as well as provide a real-time display of the data collection results to the operator. The notebook computer and color <b>graphics</b> <b>printer</b> components of the system would only be used for analyzing and plotting the data. In essence, the provided equipment is composed of an acquisition system and an analysis system. The data can be transferred from the acquisition system to the analysis system {{at the end of the}} data collection or at some other agreeable time...|$|E
50|$|The {{operating}} system offers an {{application programming interface}} that allows development of character-based applications, but not for accessing most of the hardware, such as <b>graphics</b> cards, <b>printers,</b> or mice. This required programmers to access the hardware directly, usually resulting in each application having {{its own set of}} device drivers for each hardware peripheral. Hardware manufacturers would release specifications to ensure device drivers for popular applications were available.|$|R

50|$|The Okimate 10 had two {{interchangeable}} wax-ink cartridges, a black {{one and a}} color one. The black cartridge {{was used}} for text printing, and the color was used for graphics. The color ribbon had three primary colors which were overlaid and dithered {{on top of each}} other to create secondary colors. Thus to print a <b>graphic,</b> the <b>printer</b> typically needed to make three passes over the same line before advancing.|$|R
50|$|To entice game {{manufacturers}} {{to move from}} DOS to Windows, Microsoft provided a first attempt at high-speed graphics and animation capabilities for Windows 3.1x, introduced in September 1994. Windows' GDI capabilities were originally designed with static images in-mind, allowing only for write-only graphics calls. WinG provided a device-independent interface to <b>graphics</b> and <b>printer</b> hardware, and allowed programs to have both read and write capabilities to the WinGDC (WinG device context).|$|R

50|$|One {{significant}} difference from previous versions of Windows NT {{is that the}} Graphics Device Interface (GDI) is moved into kernel mode rather than being in user mode in the CSRSS process. This eliminated a process-to-process context switch in calling GDI functions, resulting in a significant performance improvement over Windows NT 3.51, particularly in the graphical user interface. This, however, also mandated that <b>graphics</b> and <b>printer</b> drivers had to run in kernel mode as well, resulting in potential stability issues.|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} the computerised trademark search system developed in 1984 - 1985 as {{the first stage of}} the USPTO's automation plan, and now fully operational. The system, called 'T-Search' includes not only automatic phonetic searching, but also capabilities of full text search with indexing features and couples them with the capability to search the figurative elements of trademarks. The database contains records of pending applications and registered trademarks, both those in force and those abandoned, cancelled or expired after 5 March, 1984, and the electronic data includes a 'HELP' facility explaining how the system is not to be used. There are records in the system of almost three quarters of a million trademarks, of which {{about a quarter of a}} million include figurative elements, and the database is updated daily. The system currently supports 70 workstations and 33 <b>graphic</b> <b>printers.</b> Retrieval is on the basis of registration or serial numbers, design mark codes, wordmarks, phonetics or syllables, and search terms may be related by Boolean operators and may be truncated on either left or right for root word search. A typical example of a search by a trademark examiner is described. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of molecules derive {{in part from}} their structures. Because {{of the importance of}} understanding molecular structures various methodologies, ranging from first principles to empirical technique, were developed for computing the structure of molecules. For large molecules such as polymer model compounds, the structural information is difficult to comprehend by examining tabulated data. Therefore, a molecular graphics display system, called MOLDS, was developed to help interpret the data. MOLDS is a menu-driven program developed to run on the LADC SNS computer systems. This program can read a data file generated by the modeling programs or data can be entered using the keyboard. MOLDS has the following capabilities: draws the 3 -D representation of a molecule using stick, ball and ball, or space filled model from Cartesian coordinates, draws different perspective views of the molecule; rotates the molecule on the X, Y, Z axis or about some arbitrary line in space, zooms in on a small area of the molecule in order to obtain a better view of a specific region; and makes hard copy representation of molecules on a <b>graphic</b> <b>printer.</b> In addition, MOLDS can be easily updated and readily adapted to run on most computer systems...|$|R
40|$|SEDSTAT is an {{interactive}} computer program for processing and presentation of grain size data. The program utilizes graphic and moment methods for {{the calculation of}} grain size statistical parameters. The program has a menu driven format {{that can be easily}} understood by anyone with little, or no computer experience. Data storage and retrieval are the major features of SEDST AT. Another important feature of the program is the built in editor that prompts the user to enter and edit the unprocessed data of weight retained on each sieve and the sieve mesh size in Phi units. The program starts with receiving data from the keyboard or a disk data file; it then calculates the weight percentage, and cumulative weight percentage retained on each sieve. The gaussian (probability) interpolations and extrapolations are then performed to obtain the requisite critical percentiles that are used to calculate Folk and Ward graphical statistical parameters. Grouped moment statistical parameters are also calculated. Another function of the program is to construct two graphs; the first is a histogram of class weight percentage versus size class interval and the second is a probability plot of cumulative weight percentage versus size class interval. Below both of these graphs the parameters of grain size statistics are printed. A hard copy of the graphs may be obtained using a <b>graphic</b> <b>printer</b> or a screen dumping routine...|$|R
