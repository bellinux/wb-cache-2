40|$|Rolling element {{bearings}} contain seals to keep lubricant {{inside and}} contamination outside the bearing system. These bearings {{are more often}} lubricated with grease rather than oil. Much knowledge is available on oil lubricated seals but {{a good understanding of}} <b>grease</b> <b>lubricated</b> seals is lacking. In this thesis, first the lubrication, pumping and sealing mechanisms of oil and <b>grease</b> <b>lubricated</b> radial lip seals have been discussed. The first paper reviews the public literature. This review has shown that very little is known on grease lubrication in radial lip seals. The primary lubrication, sealing and pumping mechanisms found for oil lubricated seals are micro-elastohydrodynamic lubrication between the seal and shaft roughness and tangential deformations of the seal surface for a pumping action. These mechanisms are important but it is felt that other effects have to be included for explaining differences seen in <b>grease</b> <b>lubricated</b> radial lip seals. One effect in grease lubrication is the normal stress effect which is described in the second paper. It is shown that the grease rheology and especially the normal stress effect {{play a significant role in}} film formation in <b>grease</b> <b>lubricated</b> seals. The model predicts that 50 to 60 % of the load carrying capacity can be generated by the normal stress effect for a low contact pressure bearing seal depending on the operating conditions. The oil bleed model presented in the third paper describes the release of oil from the grease. This model is based on viscous flow through the porous soap microstructure and the driving force is the pressure gradient resulting from centripetal forces. It is shown that the soap fibre distribution has to become anisotropic during oil bleed and the model has been validated with experiments at different temperatures and rotating speeds. The model can be used with good confidence for longer periods of time and can be used as input for replenishment models.

40|$|Grease-lubricated journal {{bearings}} present a common challenge for construction equipment manufacturers in the world. The common design methodology {{is based on}} empirical data and has worked very well historically because the market and governments have accepted that bearings in construction equipment need frequent lubrication and exchange of worn parts.

These requirements call for better methods of designing <b>grease</b> <b>lubricated</b> {{journal bearings}}. The goal of the outlined work was to develop better design methods for <b>grease</b> <b>lubricated</b> journal-bearing design used in heavy-duty construction equipment machines, in order to prolong life and lubrication intervals. The research approach of the project can roughly be divided into three phases: 1. Development of test apparatus and test methods for journal bearing studies. 2. Bench tests of <b>grease</b> <b>lubricated</b> journal bearing design. 3. Verification between bench tests and computer simulations. In the thesis {{the current state of}} the art in bearing design for construction equipment is discussed and summarized in the form of design guidelines. The suggested design steps are just a mean to get to the starting point of design. The simple guidelines do however serve a purpose when collected since most published bearing design guidelines are aimed at the bushing material or at continuously rotating bearings. The influence of housing, environment and load cases can not be ignored when designing a bearing.

40|$|The {{rheology}} of soap thickened greases {{has been}} investigated in a cone and plate rheometer and a model that includes base oil viscosity and temperature has been suggested and fitted to the results. With {{the use of a}} bouncing ball apparatus, the pressure coefficient of the limiting shear stress of the greases was determined. It is related to friction in EHL and the results verified the friction reducing properties of the soap thickeners of the grease. Film thickness in EHL of a <b>grease</b> <b>lubricated</b> point contact was measured in a ball and disc apparatus. The initial film thickness was thicker than the film thickness given by the base oil. After some seconds of running the film thickness dropped far below the base oil film thickness, because of insufficient replenishment. Replenishment was studied by looking at the distribution and flow of lubricant around the contact in the ball and disc apparatus. Primary reservoirs and primary bands close to the track of the contact, on the ball and the disc, contained small amounts of grease that constituted a potential supply of lubricant to the inlet of the contact. The majority of the grease was pushed away from the contact initially and seemed no to participate in the lubrication. Soap thickener formations were observed entering the contact in the ball and disc apparatus and cause a local increase in the film thickness that disturbed the normally horseshoe-shaped film thickness map. For lithium greases, the amount and size of the film disturbances were found to be connected with the manufacturing process of the grease and the soap thickener content. A method to evaluate the pressure fluctuations induced by the film thickness disturbances was proposed. The method was verified by comparing film thickness measurements from an oil lubricated contact and the pressure profile calculated from that, with the results from a fully numerical solution. Good agreement was found. The method was applied to a <b>grease</b> <b>lubricated</b> contact and showed significant variations in the pressure, caused by the soap thickener formations.
