Although rooftop mounted systems are small and display a higher cost per watt than large utility-scale installations, they account for the largest share in the market.

50|$|Home {{computers}} were {{a class of}} microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s.

These {{computers were}} a <b>distinct</b> <b>market</b> segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporary business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.|$|E

5000|$|However, in {{national}} accounts the term {{has a more}} specific meaning.

These are non-commercial or partly commercial organizations, which can be mainly self-funded, but not for profit, or mainly funded by sources {{other than their own}} revenue. Statisticians therefore have to define [...] "market production" [...] much more exactly, {{in order to be able}} to separate out market production in a consistent way, and distinguish it from non-market production.

[...] It was established to promote the cause of environmental law reform and to empower citizens {{so that they could}} work together to bring about progressive change. For much of its history, it has been engaged directly in law reform, legal education and test case litigation. In the late 1980s it was determined that a stand-alone environmental law organization, which would devote itself primarily to test case litigation, was required. As a result, West Coast Environmental Law played {{an active role in the}} establishment of Sierra Legal Defence Fund, now known as Ecojustice Canada, to take the lead in using test litigation to defend and protect the environment. West Coast Environmental Law in turn narrowed its focus to drafting and advancing legislative reform initiatives and providing public legal education. From 1990 to present West Coast Environmental Law and Ecojustice Canada have avoided duplication by cooperating and coordinating on areas of potential overlap, and having <b>distinct</b> <b>market</b> niches.|$|E

Statistical differences between the two genders were found for four factors.

This study concludes that time is ripe for banks in southeast Nigeria to start treating male and female genders as <b>distinct</b> <b>market</b> segments. </p...|$|E

It is common for general users to use small format cameras in their daily lives. Medium format camera, on the other side, is another camera type with fewer mentioned. Therefore, this dissertation adopts Windrum (2005) approaches in order to retest hypotheses of <b>distinct</b> <b>market</b> niches in both 35 mm SLR and medium format cameras.

This dissertation research applies hedonic price method and regression analysis to those four models. This dissertation research applies hedonic price method and regression analysis to those four models. This research tries to investigate hypothesis issues such as: the technical characteristics of cameras, <b>distinct</b> <b>market</b> niches, a Moore’s law effect, and brand equity issues. The result shows that camera price can be explained by technical characteristics. In addition, the finding indicated that <b>distinct</b> <b>market</b> niches do exist for 35 mmSLR and medium format cameras. Besides, this study examine that the Moore’s law would not apply to the case of camera markets. This study perceives some camera manufacturers have their own brand equity in the marketplace. This dissertation expects the potential contribution to not only twenty years of time scale but the topic of medium format camera and 35 mm SLR camera. By testing the hypothesis of these two types of cameras, this dissertation supposed to provide findings that helped other researchers to have further understanding the relationship between consumer heterogeneous preference and medium format cameras...|$|E
