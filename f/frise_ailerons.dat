25|$|The wings were {{constructed}} using corrugated duralumin box spars and tubular rib assemblies, with a fabric covering and <b>Frise</b> <b>ailerons</b> {{on the upper}} and lower wings. Duralumin walkways were provided to allow ready access to the engines for maintenance purposes. The tail unit consisted of braced monoplane horizontal and vertical stabilizers; the tailplane was fitted with Flettner-type servo tabs for trimming on the Short Scylla which had the same wings and tail as the Kent.|$|E
25|$|The Shadow's {{slightly}} tapered wings, {{which have}} down-turned wingtips and leading edges which droop towards the tip, consist of plywood leading edge D-section boxes, built onto mixed plywood and aluminium web shear structures with styrofoam formers. The {{rear of the}} wing is covered in polyester fabric. The wing carries <b>Frise</b> <b>ailerons</b> and three position flaps. The shorter span wings of the later Streak variants are built in the same way, but have no gap between the ailerons and flaps.|$|E
500|$|The I-250 was a low-wing, {{all-metal}} aircraft with a monocoque fuselage. Other {{than the}} VRDK the aircraft was largely conventional in layout, although the cockpit was set very {{far back in}} the fuselage, almost {{to the base of}} the vertical tail. The two-spar wings had a thickness of 10% to preserve aileron control and avoid tip stall. They were fitted with <b>Frise</b> <b>ailerons</b> and slotted flaps. Fuel was contained in a [...] fuselage tank and a [...] tank in each wing. The conventional landing gear mainwheels had a levered suspension and retracted inwards. The tail wheel retracted aft into the very small ventral fin. The VK-107A engine initially drove a [...] VISh-105SV propeller.|$|E
50|$|He {{invented the}} <b>Frise</b> <b>aileron,</b> {{also known as}} the slotted aileron, in 1921, which is {{designed}} to counteract adverse yaw, which won him the Royal Aeronautical Society's Wakefield Gold Medal (for advances in aviation safety) awarded on 30 May 1933. The <b>Frise</b> <b>aileron</b> has an effect on parasitic drag so that the total drag on both wings is the same when an aircraft executes a roll.|$|R
50|$|The {{downward}} {{aileron deflection}} {{on the left}} increases the airfoil camber, which will typically increase the profile drag. Conversely, the upward aileron deflection on the right will decrease the camber and profile drag. The profile drag imbalance adds to the adverse yaw. The exception is on a <b>Frise</b> <b>aileron,</b> described further below.|$|R
40|$|Compressibilit:y effects on. the aerodynanic section {{characteristics}} of an airfoil with a round-nose slotted <b>Frise</b> <b>aileron</b> were investigated from pressure distributions obtaine;J at various airfoil angles of attack and aileron angles for:; [...] rach numbers from 0. 25 to approximately 0. ? 6 ~ The aileron tested represented {{a modification of}} a sharp-nose <b>Frise</b> <b>aileron</b> previously investigated by the NACA.

500|$|The Yak-19 had an {{flattened}} oval-shaped, metal semi-monocoque fuselage {{with the}} single-seat cockpit and its teardrop-shaped canopy positioned just {{forward of the}} [...] axial-flow RD-10F turbojet engine. Its air intake was in the nose and the afterburner was positioned {{at the rear of}} the fuselage, just below the tail structure. Fitted with tricycle landing gear, the main landing gear retracted inwards into the fuselage while the nose gear retracted forwards. The laminar-flow, two-spar, straight wing was mounted in the middle of the fuselage. It was equipped with modified Fowler flaps and <b>Frise</b> <b>ailerons.</b> The rudder was split into two sections by the horizontal stabilizers; the upper portion was fabric-covered while the lower half was metal-skinned. The pilot was protected by a bulletproof windscreen, a forward armor plate and an armored seat back. In addition, he was provided with an ejection seat. The Yak-19 was equipped with four fuel tanks in the fuselage that had a total capacity of [...] of fuel. It was armed with two [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon, each with 70 rounds.|$|E
500|$|The B-37, {{given the}} service name [...] "Firebrand" [...] on 11 July 1941, was a low-winged, {{all-metal}} monoplane. Aft {{of the cockpit}} the fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin semi-monocoque, but forward it had a circular-section, tubular-steel frame that housed the [...] main fuel tank and the [...] auxiliary fuel tank behind the engine. The radiators for the neatly cowled Sabre engine were housed in wing-root extensions. The large wing consisted of a two-spar centre section with manually folded outer panels (with five degrees of dihedral) to allow more compact storage in the hangar decks of aircraft carriers. To increase lift and reduce landing speed the wing was fitted with large, hydraulically powered Fairey-Youngman flaps that extended {{to the edges of}} the <b>Frise</b> <b>ailerons.</b> The fixed armament of four [...] Hispano autocannon was fitted in the outer wing panels with 200 rounds per gun. The fin and rudder were positioned forward of the elevator to ensure spin recovery and that the rudder would retain its effectiveness. The mainwheels of the conventional landing gear were mounted at the ends of the centre wing section and retracted inwards. The Firebrand was unusual in {{the fact that there was}} an airspeed gauge mounted outside of the cockpit so that during landing the pilot would not have to look down into the cockpit to take instrument readings, foreshadowing the modern heads-up display.|$|E
500|$|The OKB chose a [...] "pod-and-boom" [...] layout {{for their}} new fighter, the I-300 (also called the izdeliye F (model or product F) by the OKB) because it offered the {{advantages}} of improved landing performance and better visibility from the cockpit when landing but it had some drawbacks, such as the unfamiliar tricycle arrangement of the landing gear, protecting the rear fuselage from the jet exhaust, and where to place the aircraft's armament. The all-metal aircraft had unswept, mid-mounted wings with two prominent air intakes in the nose. Its two-spar wings were fitted with slotted flaps and <b>Frise</b> <b>ailerons.</b> Its powerplant comprised two RD-20 turbojets, which were Soviet-manufactured versions of the BMW 003. The two engines were located behind the cockpit in the lower fuselage, with the exhaust exiting under the tail unit. A steel laminate heatshield was installed {{on the bottom of}} the rear fuselage to protect it from the exhaust gasses. There were four bag-type fuel tanks in the fuselage and three in each wing, providing a total internal fuel capacity of 1,625 liters (429 US gallons). The cockpit was not pressurized. The planned armament consisted of a 57mm NL-57 cannon mounted in the centerline engine intake bulkhead and two 23mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon mounted on the lower lip of the air intakes. The N-57 gun was provided with 28 rounds and the two NS-23 cannons had 80 rounds each.|$|E
50|$|A claimed {{benefit of}} the <b>Frise</b> <b>aileron</b> {{is the ability to}} {{counteract}} adverse yaw. To do so {{the leading edge of the}} aileron has to be sharp or bluntly rounded, which adds significant drag to the going up aileron and helps the aircraft to yaw (turn) in the desired direction, but adds some unpleasant, non linear effect and or potentially dangerous aerodynamic vibration (flutter). Adverse yaw moments are more efficiently countered by the use of differential aileron movement.|$|R
40|$|Pressure {{distribution}} {{measurements were}} made over an airfoil with slotted <b>Frise</b> <b>aileron</b> up to 0. 76 Mach at various angles of attack and aileron defections. Section characteristics were determined from these pressure data. Results indicated loss of aileron rolling power for deflections ranging from - 12 Degrees to - 19 Degrees. High stick forces for non-differential deflections incurred at high speed, which {{were due to}} overbalancing tendency of up-moving aileron, may precipitate serious control difficulties. Detailed results are presented graphically...|$|R
5000|$|The Monocoach H had a low, {{one-piece}} wooden wing, {{built around}} two box-spars with girder-type ribs and fabric covering. In plan the very low aspect ratio (5.6) wing was rectangular out to semi-elliptical tips.

2500|$|The Gurnard was a single-bay biplane. It had straight-edged, {{constant}} chord wings, the lower one being slightly shorter in span and markedly narrower in chord. Both wings carried dihedral, the upper plane the most. The wings were duralumin structures, fabric covered, with simple, near-parallel interplane struts between the spars.

2500|$|The wing {{leading edge}} is {{straight}} {{except for some}} pinching at the root and the wing has constant chord over about the inner 60% of span. [...] Outboard, the trailing edge is tapered; the straight wing tips are slightly upturned. [...] <b>Frise</b> <b>ailerons</b> on piano hinges span the outboard sections and the inner sections are spanned by slotted flaps. There is a single lift strut on each side, attached to the lower fuselage. The P2008 has a low set all-moving constant chord tailplane with an anti-balance tab. [...] The fin is swept and the rudder moves above the tailplane.|$|E
50|$|The Courier (Courrier in French) was a {{parasol wing}} aircraft. Its wing was in three parts: two outer panels, straight-edged in plan with {{constant}} chord and square tips, swept at 4° and with about 4° of dihedral, {{and a small}} trapezoidal centre-section of shorter chord. This latter was a metal structure which {{also served as a}} fuel tank. The outer panels were each built around two wooden spars and duralumin ribs. Like the rest of the Courier, the wings were fabric covered. Its <b>Frise</b> type <b>ailerons</b> were balanced both statically and aerodynamically.|$|R
50|$|Particularly {{on larger}} or faster aircraft, control forces may be {{extremely}} heavy. Borrowing a discovery from boats that extending a control surface's area {{forward of the}} hinge lightens the forces needed first appeared on ailerons during World War I when ailerons were extended beyond the wingtip and provided with a horn ahead of the hinge. Known as overhung ailerons, possibly the best known examples are the Fokker Dr.I and Fokker D.VII. Later examples brought the counterbalance {{in line with the}} wing to improve control and reduce drag. This is seen less often now, due to the <b>Frise</b> type <b>aileron</b> which provides the same benefit.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an investigation conducted in the NACA 7 by 10 -foot wind tunnel of control surfaces equipped with tabs for reducing the control forces or trimming the aircraft. Two sizes of ordinary ailerons with several sizes of attached and inset tabs were tested on a Clark y wing. Tabs were also tested in combination with auxiliary balances of the horn and paddle types, and with a <b>frise</b> balance <b>aileron.</b> A tail-surface model of symmetrical section, equipped with tabs, was tested with 40 percent of the area movable (elevator) when used as a horizontal tail and 60 percent of the area movable (rudder) when used as a vertical tail. The half-span tail-surface model was tested with and without a reflection plane. The results of the tests indicated that inset tabs were superior to attached tabs for the same ratio of tab/control surface deflection...|$|R
2500|$|The D.63 was wood {{framed and}} covered with a mixture of plywood and fabric. It was a low wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with 5.83° of dihedral. Its tapered wings were based on two spruce spars and ply covered around the leading edge with fabric elsewhere; the <b>Frise</b> <b>ailerons</b> were constructed in the same way. [...] The D.63 had no flaps but light alloy air brakes were mounted under the wings at 37% chord. The fixed fin and ground adjustable tailplane were ply covered, mounting fabric covered control surfaces. [...] There was a trim tab in the port [...] elevator.|$|E
2500|$|It was an all-wood framed aircraft, skinned with {{a mixture}} of plywood and fabric. [...] High mounted wings were built around single spar with a ply covered D-box leading edge. Behind the spar the wings were largely fabric covered apart from an inboard section {{containing}} the CVV-type airbrakes which extended above and below the wing, where the ply skin reached aft to the trailing edge. There was also extra ply skinning inboard of the airbrakes, forward of the oblique, internal drag strut. Outboard of the airbrakes <b>Frise</b> <b>ailerons</b> formed the trailing edge out to rounded tips. In plan the wings were straight tapered, mostly on the trailing edge; they had 8.2° of washout and each could be detached separately for transport.|$|E
2500|$|The Sherwood Ranger is {{a single}} bay biplane, its wings having 3.83° of sweepback, 3° of {{dihedral}} on the lower wing alone but no stagger.

40|$|The {{failure of}} wing panels {{on a number}} of TBF- 1 and TBM- 1 {{airplanes}} in flight has prompted several investigations of the possible causes of failure. This report describes tests in the Langley 16 -foot high-speed tunnel to determine whether these failures could be attributed to changes in the aerodynamic characteristics of the ailerons at high speeds. The tests were made of a 12 -foot-span section including the tip and aileron of the right wing of a TBF- 1 airplane. Hinge moments, control-link stresses due to aerodynamic buffeting, and fabric-deflection photographs were obtained at true airspeeds ranging from 110 to 365 miles per hour. The aileron hinge-moment coefficients were found to vary only slightly with airspeed in spite of the large fabric deflections that developed as the speed was increased. An analysis of these results indicated that the resultant hinge moment of the ailerons as installed in the airplane would tend to restore the ailerons to their neutral position for all the high-speed flight conditions covered in the tests. Serious aerodynamic buffeting occurred at up aileron angles of - 10 degrees or greater because of stalling of the sharp projecting lip of the <b>Frise</b> <b>aileron.</b> The peak stresses set up in the aileron control linkages in the buffeting condition were as high as three times the mean stress. During the hinge-moment investigation, flutter of the test installation occurred at airspeeds of about 150 miles per hour. This flutter condition was investigated in some detail and slow-motion pictures were made of the motion of the wing tip and aileron. The flutter was found to involve simultaneous normal bending and chordwise oscillation of the wing and flapping of the aileron. The aileron motion appeared to be coupled with this flutter condition and was investigated in some detail and slow-motion pictures were made of the motion of the wing tip and aileron. The flutter was found to involve simultaneous normal bending and chordwise oscillation of the wing and flapping of the aileron. The aileron motion appeared to be coupled with the motion of the wing through the mass unbalance of the aileron in the normal-to-chord plane due to location of the hinge line 2. 17 inches below the center of gravity of the aileron. Flutter did not occur when the installation was stiffened to prevent chordwise motion or when the bending frequency of the aileron system was appreciably higher than that of the wing as in the complete airplane installation...|$|R
2500|$|The wings {{were built}} around two spars. The central 25% of their span, between the booms, had {{constant}} chord. [...] Immediately outboard {{they had a}} wider chord and beyond were double straight tapered to rounded tips. They carried [...] almost full span, narrow chord <b>Frise</b> <b>ailerons.</b> Forward, the slim, square section and untapered tail booms blended into the wings at about mid-chord, the aft ends carrying a constant chord tailplane slightly above them. [...] This had rounded tips and a central elevator with a trim tab. [...] A central, single, tall, round tipped, wire braced vertical tail was mounted on in it. The H.110 had a fixed, split, conventional undercarriage with each spatted mainwheel on a faired, near vertical shock absorber and a rearward leaning strut together forming a V, laterally braced with an inverted V-strut attached near the under fuselage centre line. [...] There was a central tailwheel on a long leg under the fin.|$|E
2500|$|The Curlew was an {{all-metal}} aeroplane, {{apart from}} the fabric covering of its elliptical, cantilever wing, and so an unusual light plane for its time. [...] The wing carried short span <b>Frise</b> <b>ailerons</b> outboard. [...] The rest of the trailing edge carried manually operated split flaps. The fuselage was a monocoque structure, built on duralumin ovals and stringers, covered with stress bearing Alclad sheet. [...] The engine installation was particularly neat for a radial. [...] The 7-cylinder 26.5 in (673mm) diameter 90hp (67kW) Pobjoy Niagara came as a [...] "power-egg" [...] complete with all accessories and its own long chord cowling, plus Pobjoy's characteristic [...] "smiley" [...] front baffle. [...] The similarity to inline installations was enhanced by the upward off-set of the drive shaft of the two-bladed propeller, caused by the gearbox. [...] The two generous open cockpits were in tandem, the front one at mid wing and the other at the trailing edge. The empennage was conventional: a slender fin carried a rounded, unbalanced rudder which extended down {{the bottom of the}} fuselage, and the tapered, mid-fuselage tailplane carried separate elevators so the rudder could move between them. [...] The undercarriage had vertical (in flying position) legs from the wings with a large (3 in or 76mm) movement, each sloping outwards slightly to increase the track and braced inwards by struts from halfway down the legs to the wing roots.|$|E

50|$|Note: <b>Frise</b> <b>ailerons</b> are {{primarily}} {{designed to reduce}} roll control forces. Contrary to the illustration, the aileron leading edge has to be rounded to prevent flow separation and flutter at negative deflections. That prevents important differential drag forces.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, {{as well as}} {{reducing}} adverse yaw, <b>Frise</b> <b>ailerons</b> {{will increase}} the overall drag of the aircraft much more than applying rudder correction. Therefore they are less popular in aircraft where minimizing drag is important (e.g. in a glider).|$|E
50|$|<b>Frise</b> <b>ailerons</b> are {{designed}} so that when up aileron is applied, some of the forward edge of the aileron will protrude downward into the airflow, causing increased drag on this (down-going) wing. This will counter the drag produced by the other aileron, thus reducing adverse yaw.|$|E
50|$|The wings have {{conventional}} <b>Frise</b> <b>ailerons</b> and slotted flaps. The {{elevator and}} rudder are also conventional.
