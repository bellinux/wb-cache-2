There was another battle the next day, and the Seminoles were assumed to be headed for the Wahoo Swamp. Call waited to bring the other column across the river, then entered the Wahoo Swamp on November 21.

500|$|On 15 February 1990, in {{a speech}} {{delivered}} at the Sapienza University of Rome, Cardinal Ratzinger (later to become Pope Benedict XVI) cited some current views on the Galileo affair as forming what he called [...] "a symptomatic case that permits us to see <b>how</b> <b>deep</b> <b>the</b> self-doubt of the modern age, {{of science and technology}} goes today". Some of the views he cited were those of the philosopher Paul Feyerabend, whom he quoted as saying [...] "The Church at the time of Galileo kept much more closely to reason than did Galileo himself, and she took into consideration the ethical and social consequences of Galileo's teaching too. Her verdict against Galileo was rational and just and the revision of this verdict can be justified only on the grounds of what is politically opportune." [...] The Cardinal did not clearly indicate whether he agreed or disagreed with Feyerabend's assertions. He did, however, say [...] "It would be foolish to construct an impulsive apologetic on the basis of such views." ...|$|E

2500|$|As an example, the {{radioactive}} decay of carbon-14 is exponential with a half-life of 5,730 years. A quantity of carbon-14 will decay {{to half of}} its original amount (on average) after 5,730 years, regardless of how big or small the original quantity was. After another 5,730 years, one-quarter of the original will remain. On the other hand, the time {{it will take a}} puddle to half-evaporate depends on <b>how</b> <b>deep</b> <b>the</b> puddle is. Perhaps a puddle of a certain size will evaporate down to half its original volume in one day. But on the second day, {{there is no reason to}} expect that one-quarter of the puddle will remain; in fact, it will probably be much less than that. This is an example where the half-life reduces as time goes on. (In other non-exponential decays, it can increase instead.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The Phoenicians {{and their}} successors, the Carthaginians, were {{particularly}} adept sailors {{and learned to}} voyage further and further away from the coast {{in order to reach}} destinations faster. [...] One tool that helped them was the sounding weight. [...] This tool was bell shaped, made from stone or lead, with tallow inside attached to a very long rope. [...] When out to sea, sailors could lower the sounding weight in order to determine <b>how</b> <b>deep</b> <b>the</b> waters were, and therefore estimate how far they were from land. [...] Also, the tallow picked up sediments from the bottom which expert sailors could examine to determine exactly where they were. [...] The Carthaginian Hanno the Navigator is known to have sailed through the Strait of Gibraltar c. 500 BC and explored the Atlantic coast of Africa. [...] There is general consensus that the expedition reached {{at least as far as}} Senegal. [...] There is a lack of agreement whether the furthest limit of Hanno's explorations was Mount Cameroon or Guinea's 890-metre (2910-foot) Mount Kakulima.|$|E
2500|$|Diving cliffs: The {{area around}} Roaring Rapids was (and still is) laid {{out like a}} kind of grotto, with many lower-intensity attractions. One was a pair of diving cliffs—one 23 feet (7 m), the other 18 feet (5.4 m)—above a 16-foot (5 m) deep pool. However, the pool below was not blocked off from those who might be {{swimming}} in or away from other attractions, and nothing at water level gave any indication to swimmers below that they could expect people to dive in right next to them - or right on top of them. [...] The sole lifeguard on duty often had his or her hands full dealing with the results of those collisions. Also, nonswimmers would jump off the cliffs, not fully appreciating <b>how</b> <b>deep</b> <b>the</b> water below was, and have to be rescued. Former employee Tom Fergus says the bottom of the pool was eventually painted white {{to make it easier to}} spot any bodies on the bottom. The large pool into which people jumped is no longer used for regular swimming, only to deposit used tubes. Still operating, known as Canyon Cliffs.|$|E

[...] USA Today gave the film {{three and a half}} stars out of four, saying of the screenplay, [...] "It appears as if screenwriters Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson have pulled off a miracle in keeping multiple stories straight. Have they ever. Ellroy's novel has four extra layers of plot and three times as many characters ... the writers have trimmed unwieldy muscle, not just fat, and gotten away with it." [...] In his review for Newsweek, David Ansen wrote, [...] "L.A. Confidential asks the audience to raise its level a bit, too—you actually {{have to pay attention to}} follow the double-crossing intricacies of the plot. The reward for your work is dark and dirty fun." [...] Richard Schickel, in his review for Time, wrote, [...] "It's a movie of shadows and half lights, the best approximation of the old black-and-white noir look anyone has yet managed on color stock. But it's no idle exercise in style. The film's look suggests <b>how</b> <b>deep</b> <b>the</b> tradition of police corruption runs." ...|$|E

However, with the weak economy, NBC was thought to have turned to companies already buying ad time for an additional purchase or two as set by the Los Angeles-based Forza Migliozzi agency, which would have eight advertisers simultaneously in one 30-second ad. SoBe and DreamWorks Animation aired a 3-D trailer for the upcoming film Monsters vs. Aliens, along with a 3-D ad for Sobe Life Water that featured Ray Lewis and Matt Light dancing Swan Lake (renamed Lizard Lake for this ad), as well as the promo for the upcoming episode of Chuck in 3D.

2500|$|No crater {{should be}} expected. The 10,000-pound thrust Descent Propulsion System was {{throttled}} very far down {{during the final}} landing. The Lunar Module was no longer quickly decelerating, so the descent engine only had to support the lander's own weight, which was lessened by the Moon's gravity and by the near exhaustion of the descent propellants. At landing, the engine thrust divided by the nozzle exit area is only about 10 kilopascals (1.5 PSI). Beyond the engine nozzle, the plume spreads, and the pressure drops very quickly. Rocket exhaust gasses expand much more quickly after leaving the engine nozzle in a vacuum than in an atmosphere. The effect of an atmosphere on rocket plumes can be easily seen in launches from Earth; as the rocket rises through the thinning atmosphere, the exhaust plumes broaden very noticeably. To lessen this, rocket engines made for vacuums have longer bells than those made for use on Earth, but they still cannot stop this spreading. The lander's exhaust gasses, therefore, expanded quickly well beyond the landing site. The descent engines did scatter {{a lot of very}} fine surface dust as seen in 16mm movies of each landing, and many mission commanders spoke of its effect on visibility. The landers were generally moving horizontally as well as vertically, and photos do show scouring of the surface along the final descent path. Finally, the lunar regolith is very compact below its surface dust layer, making it impossible for the descent engine to blast out a [...] "crater". A blast crater was measured under the Apollo 11 lander using shadow lengths of the descent engine bell and estimates of the amount that the landing gear had compressed and <b>how</b> <b>deep</b> <b>the</b> lander footpads had pressed into the lunar surface and {{it was found that the}} engine had eroded between 4 and 6 inches of regolith out from underneath the engine bell during the final descent and landing.|$|E
