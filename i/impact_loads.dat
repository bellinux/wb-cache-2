The wear mechanism of casing under impact-sliding work conditions {{has been investigated}} and many experiments have been completed with a newly developed full-scale casing wear test machine. Test results present that adhesion wear, contact fatigue, and grinding abrasion are the main wear mechanisms under impact-sliding test conditions. The friction coefficient and linear wear rate of the casing rise obviously {{with an increase in}} <b>impact</b> <b>load.</b> And the larger the <b>impact</b> <b>load,</b> the rougher the worn surface of the casing. The linear wear rate decreased slightly but the average friction coefficient increased slightly with an increase in impact frequency under an <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> of 2, 500 N. Both the linear wear rate of the casing and the average friction coefficient increased substantially with an increase in impact frequency under an <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> of 4, 000 N.

40|$|Background/purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of cyclic <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> on shear bond strengths of three different luting cements to zirconia. Materials and methods: The following cements were used in this study for bonding two zirconia blocks that were tribochemically silica-coated with the Rocatec system: Super Bond C&B (SB); Panavia Fluoro Cement (PF); and Fuji Luting (FL). Specimens were subsequently subjected to three storage conditions: 106 compressive cyclic <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> (CL), 106 shear cyclic <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> (SL), and no cyclic <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> (Control) in distilled water at 37  °C with a mechanical fatigue testing device. Shear bond strength tests were performed with a universal testing machine. Results: Bond strengths of PF+Control (63. 6 ± 2. 4  MPa) and PF+CL (57. 2 ± 3. 8  MPa) were significantly higher than those with SB and FL. There was no significant difference between CL and SL (P> 0. 05) with SB and FL. The bond strength of the FL resin-modified glass ionomer cement was significantly lower than those with PF and SB. After applying tribochemical treatment, all specimens subjected to cyclic <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> exhibited cohesive failure in the resin cement. Conclusions: After 106 compressive cyclic <b>impact</b> <b>loading,</b> the highest bond to zirconia was obtained with 10 -methacryloxydecyl-dihydrogenphosphate containing a luting system (Panavia Fluoro Cement).

It is shown that the capability of the controller for suppressing the <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> is very limited, the effect of the <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> must be considered in designing the controller of the AMB, otherwise, the AMB will loss its support capability.

40|$|Key words: elas-plastic impact load; {{numerical}} solution; bar model; tube model; mass ratio. Abstract: The explicit numerical {{method is}} used to trace the impact procedure of the tube columns impacted by a rigid body. The bar and rectangle tube models are both used to simulate the tube column. The elastic and elas-plastic <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> with different mass ratio and impact speed are obtained. The calculation results show that: for elastic models, the bigger the mass ratio and the higher the rigid body speed, the bigger the peak value of elastic impact load; at the same time, the more obvious the reduction effect of local buckling of rectangle tube on the peak value of <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> and the longer the contact time of tube model; so the peak value of <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> of the rectangle tube is not proportional to the rigid body speed. The stress wave in the tube causes a little difference between the load curves of tube model and bar model. For elas-plastic models, the higher the rigid body speed and the smaller the mass ratio, the bigger the peak value of <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> and the longer the contact time. The higher the rigid body speed, the bigger the difference between elastic and elas-plastic <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> peak value due to the expanding of plasticity.
