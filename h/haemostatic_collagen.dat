40|$|Splenic rupture is a {{frequent}} consequence of blunt abdominal trauma. Removal of the spleen (splenectomy) or alternative conservative procedures (splenorrhaphy, partial splenectomy and <b>haemostatic</b> <b>collagen</b> application) are surgical treatment options. Splenectomy was first described in 1910 by Sutherland. Laparoscopic splenectomy was first described in 1991 by Delaitre and Maignien. Since then significant improvements in instrumentation and technology such as harmonic scalpel, endovascular staplers have increased its ease of performance. Laparoscopic splenectomy for a ruptured spleen has been reported only in a few cases, in which a hand-assisted technique was used. We present the first reported case from India (to {{the best of our}} knowledge) of a successful removal of a ruptured spleen by means of a totally laparoscopic technique...|$|E
40|$|Treatment of damaged cardiac {{tissue in}} {{patients}} with high bleeding tendency can be very challenging, damaged myocardial tissue has a high rupture risk when being sutured subsequently on-going bleeding is a major risk factor for poor clinical outcome. We present a case demonstrating the feasibility in using a novel <b>haemostatic</b> <b>collagen</b> sponge {{for the management of}} a myocardial wound. This report is the first description in cardiac surgery where Hemopatch (R) sponges are used to successfully seal a left ventricle wound. Our patient was diagnosed with endocarditis, had a low pre-operative haemoglobin count and underwent cardiac surgery for multiple valve repairs. The procedure was performed on cardiopulmonary bypass, which meant our patient had to be heparinized. Despite these major risk factors for bleeding Hemopatch (R) managed to contain bleeding and seal the wound, no sutures were needed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{development}} of suture hole bleeding at peripheral arterial bypass anastomoses using PTFE graft prostheses {{is a common}} problem in peripheral vascular surgery. Traditionally the problem is managed by compression with surgical swabs and reversal heparin or by using several haemostatic device (e. g. different forms of collagen, oxidized cellulose, gelatine sponge, ethylcyanoacrylate glue or fibrin) with various success. Preclinical {{data suggest that the}} <b>haemostatic</b> effect of <b>collagen</b> is stronger than that of oxidized cellulose, but no direct clinical comparison of their hemostatic performance has been published so far. Design This randomized, controlled, prospective trial evaluates the haemostatic effect of Lyostypt versus Surgicel in arterial bypass anastomosis. 28 patients undergoing an elective peripheral vascular reconstruction due to peripheral vascular disease will be included. Suture hole bleeding occurring at the arterial bypass anastomosis using a PTFE prostheses will be stopped by the application of Lyostypt and/or Surgicel. The proximal anastomoses will be randomized intraoperatively. The patients will be allocated into 4 different treatment groups. Group 1 Lyostypt distal/Surgicel proximal; Group 2 : Lyostypt proximal/Surgicel distal; Group 3 : Surgicel distal and proximal; Group 4 : Lyostypt distal and proximal. Primary endpoint of the study is time to haemostasis. Secondary endpoints are the number of intraoperatively used haemostatic devices, postoperative mortality within 30 days as well as the intraoperative efficacy rating of the two devices evaluated by the surgeon. As a safety secondary parameter, the local and general complication occurring till 30 Â± 10 days postoperatively will also be analysed. After hospital discharge the investigator will examine the enrolled patients again at 30 days after surgery. Discussion The COBBANA trial aims to assess, whether the haemostatic effect of Lyostypt is superior to Surgicel in suture hole bleedings of arterial bypass anastomoses.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} a <b>haemostatic</b> bovine <b>collagen</b> plug (VasoSeal) in reducing patient immobilisation after cardiac catheterisation from a percutaneous femoral arterial approach. DESIGN [...] A non-randomised, prospective analysis of a new biodegradable haemostatic agent on an intention to treat basis. SETTING [...] The catheterisation suite of a regional cardiothoracic unit. PATIENTS [...] A series of 63 patients having various diagnostic investigations and therapeutic interventions {{agreed to participate in}} this study. INTERVENTIONS [...] Cardiac catheterisation was performed from a percutaneous femoral artery approach. Patients taking aspirin and those who required formal anticoagulation were not excluded. Patients were measured for the appropriate sized collagen delivery system {{at the beginning of the}} procedure. At the end of the procedure two bovine collagen plugs were applied to the surface of the femoral artery through the channel created by the application device. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Incidence of successful delivery, insertion time, immediate outcome, inpatient complications, success of mobilisation of the patient at one and two hours after the procedure, and whether these variables relate to individual patient characteristics. RESULTS [...] Successful placement of the device was achieved in 57 of 63 consecutive patients (90. 5 %). The mean (SD) insertion time was 86 (24) seconds. Six (9. 5 %) patients did not receive the haemostat because of femoral artery perforation by the tissue dilator (n = 3), inability to compress the femoral artery proximal to the site of delivery (n = 1), pre-existing haematoma (n = 1), or patient withdrawal from the study (n = 1). Uncomplicated mobilisation within two hours of investigation was possible in 54 of 57 (94. 7 %) patients receiving this device. A sizeable haematoma (> 5 x 5 cm) prevented early mobilisation in the remaining three patients. Mobilisation was uncomplicated in 32 of 34 (94. 1 %) patients mobilised at two hours and 22 of 23 (95. 6 %) at one hour (NS). One patient who was mobilised early without complication later developed evidence of claudication in the treated leg. Femoral arteriography showed a smooth intraluminal filling defect attached to the wall of the femoral artery at the puncture site. This obstruction, presumed to be a collagen plug, was treated successfully with angioplasty. Sheath size, arterial pressure, the use of aspirin, heparin or warfarin, and body mass index did not influence patient outcome. The pattern of complications did not relate to a learning curve experience. CONCLUSIONS [...] The bovine collagen haemostat is a relatively safe and effective device that allows far earlier patient mobilisation than conventional haemostasis after diagnostic and therapeutic interventions from a percutaneous femoral artery approach. These results have important implications for patients undergoing investigation in mobile x ray units or in hospital based day case units...|$|R
