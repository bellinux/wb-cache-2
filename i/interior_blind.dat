50|$|Because {{it holds}} water {{for much longer}} periods than other {{wetlands}} in the desert region, it is regionally important as a breeding site and drought refuge for many kinds of animals, especially waterbirds that have bred on, for example, interdune swamps that only retain water for a few months. Waterbirds for which the site is important when inundated include freckled and blue-billed ducks. It is also used as a staging site by migratory waders such as black-tailed godwits, common greenshanks, marsh sandpipers and red-necked stints. It provides opportunities to see large flocks of desert birds such as budgerigars. Other animals recorded at the site are the eastern long-eared bat and <b>interior</b> <b>blind</b> snake.|$|E

50|$|The {{accessibility}} of the sunlight {{is one of}} the key elements affect the positions and shapes of the building. Two 40-foot wide offices were placed apart to create a central zone for sunlight to enter from multiple facades in the building. The narrow plan allows sufficient daylight to reach deeper into the office spaces, and increase the daylight autonomy. Increase in daylight autonomy reduces 30% of the energy consumption from artificial lighting compared to a standard commercial building. The high transmittance of daylight in the winter (shading will block the direct sunlight in the summer) will also increase the heat gain and potentially reduce the demand for heating. <b>Interior</b> <b>blinds</b> are user-controlled to improve visual comfort, and it will rise automatically in the evening. The artificial light will dim or brighten up according to the change of daylighting.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} evaluate the thermal impact of complex fenestration systems on the energy balance of a building zone based on directional solar heat gain coefficients (DSHGC) and bi-directional scattering distribution functions (BSDF). The proposed methodology is presented {{as an alternative to}} layer-by-layer heat transfer models. An example of a layer-by-layer heat transfer model is the ISO 15099 as implemented in the EnergyPlus building simulation program. The ISO 15099 model relies on a number of assumptions that are not justified in the case of three-dimensional structures, air-permeable layers and deviations from ideal geometries, which are common features in commercial daylighting and solar-control systems. In this paper, the proposed methodology is implemented in the Fener simulation engine and compared with EnergyPlus for systems for which the assumptions of the ISO 15099 model are valid. Then, the Fener program is used to simulate the thermal behaviour of a zone with a fenestration system that contains sawtooth-shaped retro-reflecting <b>interior</b> <b>blinds,</b> which cannot be directly modelled with the ISO 15099 model. The impact of different control strategies on the thermal performance of the zone is demonstrated for this case study...|$|R

40|$|Windows are {{designed}} primarily {{to control the}} indoor climate and also to provide proper ventilation (air circulation). The primary objective is achieved by controlling the heat flow through the window from inside to outside in winter & from outside to inside in summer. Window solar gain has a strong influence on the building energy consumption and peak cooling load. Double glazed window are known to prevent the entry of solar gain to inside the room. Shading systems such as Venetian blinds, louver shades, draperies etc. enhances the control of solar gain through windows. In this paper the thermal performance of a double-glazed window with adjacent commercially available blinds has been studied using LBNL research software WINDOWS 6. 3 and the results so obtained are validated using a Guarded Heat Plate Apparatus. Though this type of glazing system has already been studied for colder climatic conditions in the west, due to the unavailability of literature on local climatic conditions its use in tropical countries like India is limited. A parametric study for climatic conditions of an Indian city, Chandigarh {{has been made to}} give an insight to the thermal performance of glazing systems with <b>interior</b> <b>blinds.</b> In this study the effect of different parameters such as types of glazing systems (single and double glazed), pane to blind spacing (20 mm, 30 mm and 40 mm), the Slat angle (0 o and 90 o) and the climatic condition...|$|R
40|$|Windows can {{introduce}} considerable heat {{gains and losses}} that may offset the benefits of electric light savings and cause an increase in yearly net energy use. The use of shading devices is necessary to prevent overheating and provide a glare-free visual environment. The common shading devices {{that have been in}} use in buildings are exterior overhang and <b>interior</b> <b>blinds</b> and roller shades. This study examines the impacts of exterior overhang, roller shade, and blinds devices on the total yearly energy loads for a prototypical classroom space situated in Boulder, Colorado. The measured bi-directional transmittance characteristics for a roller shade were applied to the yearly daylight availability analysis. Coordinated modeling, with an advanced daylight and electric lighting simulation program and a building thermal simulation program based on hourly weather data was used to compute yearly total building energy use. Annual lighting, cooling and heating loads for a side-lit space using the shading devices were compared with those of a base case with no shading device. Of special interest was the performance of the new roller shades in comparison to blinds and exterior overhang as they are installed in the new New York Times building. It was found that the total energy performance of the roller shade with a total transmittance of 10. 4 % was similar to blinds tilted 45 ˚ with 60 % reflectance. The roller shade consumed 12. 5 % more total building energy than exterior 1. 2 m (4 -ft) overhang...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a calorimetric measurement of layer-specific inward-flowing fractions of absorbed solar energy {{for a number}} of geometric configurations common in fenestrations with shading. The inward-flowing fractions are found to be relatively insensitive to exterior conditions. Results for an <b>interior</b> venetian <b>blind</b> over double glazing agree with thermal model calculations in literature, and are the first layer-specific verification of these calculations. It is argued that a data base of these inward-flowing fractions for a suitably broad class of geometries will make possible the determination of solar heat gain coefficient from noncalorimetric measurements of solar-optical properties of complex fenestration components, a procedure termed solar-thermal separation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{statistics}} {{published by}} Natural Resources Canada {{estimates that the}} energy demand for heating and cooling accounts for about 60 % of the total energy use of an average Canadian home. Although the overall demand for cooling energy is {{much lower than the}} demand for heating, many populated areas experience a peak demand for electricity on summer afternoons. Interior reflective window shading devices have the potential to reduce solar overheating and electricity peak demand in summer, and to improve the thermal comfort of house occupants when seated near windows. This work is part of a project to develop guidelines for effective exterior, mid-pane (inside the window) and interior shading devices in Canadian residences. This paper presents the results of three weeks of summer field measurements of interior highly reflective perforated shading screens installed on the windows of a typical two-storey detached house compared to typical <b>interior</b> Venetian <b>blinds</b> installed in an identical neighbouring house. The shading devices were closed in both houses during both daytime and night-time in order to assess the maximum possible savings in cooling energy on a 24 -hour basis. The results showed that the daily total electric energy used by the airconditioning unit and the furnace circulation fan in the house equipped with interior screen shadings was on average ~ 8 ± 2 % lower than in the house equipped with <b>interior</b> typical <b>blinds.</b> The savings in daily energy used by the air-conditioning unit alone ranged between 10 - 18 %. The interior screen shadings also reduced the hourly electricity demand for cooling by up to 45 % during a sunny day, which represents {{one of the most important}} benefits of this window shading strategy by having reduced the demand load on the electricity supply system during high-peak demand hours...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe use of {{automatically}} controlled <b>interior</b> Venetian <b>blinds</b> {{can provide}} view and penetration of daylighting through window. In this study, an automatic system of vertical blinds affixed behind windows situated on north-west facades of a laboratory room {{were developed in}} order to investigate its daylighting performance. The system controls automatically the blind slats to shade out beam sunlight. Simulation using reference calculation algorithms and sky luminance distribution models and utilizing measured beam sunlight and diffuse daylight from the sky or skylight produces results that agree well with results from experiments. Moreover, using records of beam sunlight and diffuse skylight illuminance, simulation {{results show that the}} automated vertical blind and electric lighting system, when used in a room with the same configuration as that of the experimental room, can utilize daylight to save more than 24 % of electric lighting energy in every month of the simulated year while maintaining illuminance at the workstation at the required level...|$|R

Although it went through four editions between 1910 and 1931, and was reviewed with sympathy by Haneș, the work was not popular with most critics. It rather made Stamatiad the object of derision in the literary circles. Stamatiad persevered and worked with dramatist Constantin Râuleț on the play Femei ciudate ("Strange Women"), published in Convorbiri Critice in November 1910, and as a volume in 1911. It was first staged in Bucharest by the [...] "Modern Theater" [...] company of Alexandru Davila. The text intrigued the public with its frank display of a sexual masochism disorder; according to Dragomirescu, it is [...] "well written, but strange."

40|$|Potential annual {{energy savings}} {{resulting}} from window shading devices on three prototypical Austin, Texas, single-family residences were computed in this study. Savings {{were calculated for}} <b>interior</b> (shades, <b>blinds,</b> draperies, window film, and tinted windows) and exterior (solar screens, awnings, overhangs, {{and the effects of}} recessed windows and vegetation) shading devices. The analysis was conducted with the DOE- 2 building energy analysis computer program. Nominal baseline cases (single glazing, gas heating, and nominal shading from eaves and neighboring buildings) were run for each prototype. Selected baseline variants (double glazing, all electric, and no eaves or neighbor shading) were run to test parameter sensitivity. Results are reported in terms of the annual heating and cooling energy use and energy cost, with each device in place, as compared to the baseline cases. The devices are ranked in term of energy savings and energy coat savings. Another significant result is the multiple-regression correlation of annual heating and cooling energy savings with Shading Coefficient and U-value that generalizes the performance of the shading devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} industry has made considerable energy-saving efforts in buildings, and studies of energy-savings are ongoing. Shading {{is used to}} control the solar radiation transferred through windows. Many {{studies have examined the}} position and type of shading in different countries, but few have investigated the effects of shading installation in Korea. In this study, the case of the shading installation according to the standard of Korea, and variations of the heating and cooling load in the unit area on the performance of the windows were examined. This study compared the variations of the heating and cooling load in the case of horizontal shading and the changing position of venetian blinds. This study confirmed that horizontal shading longer than the standard length in Korea saved a maximum of 13 % energy consumption. This study confirmed the point of change of energy consumption by the Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) variations. The exterior venetian blinds and those between glazing were unaffected by the SHGC. On the other hand, {{in the case of a}} south façade, the <b>interior</b> venetian <b>blinds</b> resulted in 24 % higher energy consumption than the installation of horizontal shading in case of Window to Wall Ratio (WWR) : 80 %, U-value: 2. 1 and SHGC: 0. 4...|$|R

40|$|Blind {{systems have}} been {{introduced}} to provide visual and thermal comfort, {{as well as to}} reduce energy use in buildings. A wide variety of such systems exist in terms of thermal and optical properties, location (exterior, interior), and physical configuration (size, distance between the blind slats). The current problem with blinds is that their operation is not based on the dynamics of the room (space), but on the static or manual control operated by occupants, although many studies have recognized that dynamic control can far outperform static control. One reason for the lack of dynamic control {{is that it is not}} easy to combine the room dynamics with any possible optimization algorithm. Hence, in this study, a whole building simulation tool, EnergyPlus, was integrated with MATLAB optimization toolbox to solve for optimal control of blind systems.

40|$|The {{daylight}} coefficient {{method has}} been introduced in computer simulation as an efficient approach to compute indoor daylight illuminances through building static fenestration systems. A set of coefficients are calculated only once prior to simulation start for a given number of elemental patches making up to sky vault and ground. However, for dynamic complex fenestration systems whose optical behavior (transmission, reflection and scattering) may change during simulation (such as windows with shadings), {{the efficiency of the}} daylight coefficient method may be compromised as the whole set of coefficients must be re-calculated during simulation. This paper presents {{the development of a new}} methodology to combine the daylight coefficient method with dynamic complex fenesration systems. The daylight coefficient is split into two components: one component corresponds to the unscattered transmitted light and the second to the scattered transmitted light. Both components are calculated based on the daylight coefficients of a reference fenestration, and the optical transmission characteristic and scattering effect of the actual fenestration. The resulting daylight coefficients for a given complex fenestration system may be calculated only once prior to simulation. This methodoly is implemented in Daylight 1 - 2 - 3, a new integrated energy and daylighting analysis tool for offices and classrooms. Initial validation studies, in which the results from the present method are compared with Radiance’s calculations, are carried out for a typical office space equiped with a clear window and <b>interior</b> Venetian <b>blinds.</b> The comparison shows that the new method is in good agreement with Radiance calculations, resulting in substantial simulation time savings.

This paper identifies and compares five manual blind control algorithms with unique control patterns and reports blind occlusion, rate of change data, and annual building energy consumption. The blind control schemes detailed here represent five reasonable candidates for use in lighting and energy simulation based on difference driving factors. This study was performed on a medium-sized office building using EnergyPlus with the internal daylight harvesting engine. Results show that applying manual blind control algorithms affects the total annual consumption of the building {{by as much as}} 12. 5 % and 11. 5 % for <b>interior</b> and exterior <b>blinds</b> respectively, compared to the Always Retracted blinds algorithm. Peak demand was also compared showing blind algorithms affected zone load sizing by as much as 9. 8 %. The alternate algorithms were tested for their impact on American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Guideline 14 calibration metrics and all models were found to differ from the original calibrated baseline by more than the recommended ± 15 % for coefficient of variance of the mean square error (CVRMSE) and ± 5 % for normalized mean bias error (NMBE).

40|$|Daylight redirecting {{systems with}} {{vertical}} windows {{have the potential}} to offset lighting energy use in deep perimeter zones. Microstructured prismatic window films can be manufactured using low-cost, roll-to-roll fabrication methods and adhered to the inside surface of existing windows as a retrofit measure or installed as a replacement insulating glass unit in the clerestory portion of the window wall. A clear film patterned with linear, 50 - 250 micrometer high, four-sided asymmetrical prisms was fabricated and installed in the south-facing, clerestory low-e, clear glazed windows of a full-scale testbed facility. Views through the film were distorted. The film was evaluated in a sunny climate over a two-year period to gauge daylighting and visual comfort performance. The daylighting aperture was small (window-towall ratio of 0. 18) and the lower windows were blocked off to isolate the evaluation to the window film. Workplane illuminance measurements were made in the 4. 6 m (15 ft) deep room furnished as a private office. Analysis of discomfort glare was conducted using high dynamic range imaging coupled with the evalglare software tool, which computes the daylight glare probability and other metrics used to evaluate visual discomfort. The window film was found to result in perceptible levels of discomfort glare on clear sunny days from the most conservative view point {{in the rear of the}} room looking toward the window. Daylight illuminance levels at the rear of the room were significantly increased above the reference window condition, which was defined as the same glazed clerestory window but with an <b>interior</b> Venetian <b>blind</b> (slat angle set to the cut-off angle), for the equinox to winter solstice period on clear sunny days. For partly cloudy and overcast sky conditions, daylight levels were improved slightly. To reduce glare, the daylighting film was coupled with a diffusing film in an insulating glazing unit. The diffusing film retained the directionality of the redirected light spreading it within a small range of outgoing angles. This solution was found to reduce glare to imperceptible levels while retaining for the most part the illuminance levels achieved solely by the daylighting film...|$|R
