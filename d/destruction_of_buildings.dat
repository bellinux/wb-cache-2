5|$|In late December {{the last}} of the {{survivors}} that were able to be extricated were pulled from the fallen buildings, rescue operations ceased, and the cleanup began, beginning with the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> that were too heavily damaged to be repaired. Six friends were {{in the basement of a}} nine-story building relocating barrels when it came down around them on December 7. Their injuries were minor, but one person did suffer a broken arm. They sustained themselves on the food supplies—fruit salad, pickles, and smoked ham—that were available in the basement for 35 days before their rescue in January.|$|E
5|$|The {{air attacks}} on Japan caused {{hundreds}} of thousands of casualties, though estimates of the number who were killed and wounded vary considerably. The strategic attacks by the Twentieth Air Force caused most of the casualties and damage. The figures most frequently cited in the literature on the campaign are sourced from the USSBS report The Effects of Bombing on Health and Medical Services in Japan which estimated that 333,000 Japanese were killed and 473,000 wounded. Included in this figure were an estimated 120,000 dead and 160,000 injured in the two atomic bomb attacks. Another USSBS report, The Effects of Strategic Bombing on Japanese Morale, included a much higher estimate of 900,000 killed and 1.3million injured which was reached by a Japanese research team using a statistical sampling methodology. While this figure is also occasionally cited, the USSBS' investigators regarded the work of their statistical teams as unsatisfactory, and the researchers were unable to calculate the error rate of this estimate. The postwar Japanese government calculated in 1949 that 323,495 people had been killed by air attacks in the home islands. The <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> housing government records during air raids contributed to the uncertainty about the number of casualties. The Twentieth Air Force lost 414 B-29s during attacks on Japan. Over 2,600 American bomber crew members were killed, including POWs who died in captivity, and a further 433 were wounded.|$|E
25|$|<b>Destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> and {{infrastructure}} was nearly total {{in parts of}} the inner city business and residential sectors. The outlying sections suffered relatively little damage. This averages to one fifth of all buildings, and 50% in the inner city.|$|E

25|$|Lava {{flows in}} the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province {{are among the}} least hazardous, even though they can be {{enormously}} destructive to property in their path. This is because lava generally moves slowly enough {{for people to get}} out of their way, though this is dependent on the viscosity of the lava. Lava flows typically have secondary hazards, including the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> and ejection of volcanic gases. Forest fires started by lava flows are also a possibility in this part of Canada. The typical lava fountains in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province are commonly associated with lava flows, but these do not normally reach heights more than a few hundred metres. Therefore, the dangers caused by lava fountains are only adjacent to the erupting volcano.|$|E
25|$|The {{human body}} is more {{resistant}} to sheer overpressure than most buildings, however, the powerful winds produced by this overpressure, as in a hurricane, are capable of throwing human bodies into objects or throwing debris at high velocity, both with lethal results, rendering casualties highly dependent on surroundings. For example, Sumiteru Taniguchi recounts that, while clinging to the tremoring road surface after the Fat Man detonation, he witnessing another child being blown away, the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> around him and stones flying through the air. Similarly, Akihiro Takahashi and his classmates were blown by the blast of Little Boy by {{a distance of about}} 10 meters, having survived due to not colliding with any walls etc. during his flight through the air, Likewise, Katsuichi Hosoya has a near identical testimony.|$|E
25|$|As for {{architecture}} in the city, both {{the body of}} architectural styles {{as well as the}} prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939–1945, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day {{when it comes to their}} demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of Hotel Phoenix that stood on corner of the Market Square was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include The Nobel House (subject to the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of Old Hotel Börs which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by Frithiof Strandell.|$|E

500|$|By late February, Breckinridge had {{concluded}} that the Confederate cause was hopeless. He opposed the use of guerilla warfare by Confederate forces and urged a national surrender. Meeting with Confederate senators from Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, and Texas, he urged, [...] "This has been a magnificent epic. In God's name let it not terminate in a farce." [...] In April, with Union forces approaching Richmond, Breckinridge organized the escape of the other cabinet officials to Danville, Virginia. Afterward, he ordered the burning of the bridges over the James River and ensured the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> and supplies that might aid the enemy. During the surrender of the city, he helped preserve the Confederate government and military records housed there.|$|E

The structure of obstructions changes depending on parameters and direction of explosion, first of all size and location of wreckages. Sorting out of obstructions is executed by machines and mechanisms which do not answer the requirements of these works, that predetermines falling short of logistical support {{to the requirements of}} rescue or restoration works, and it increases terms and labour intensiveness of their conduct. Development of technological decisions is therefore needed for the effective sorting out <b>of</b> <b>destructions</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> objects. Purpose.

Experience <b>of</b> works shows on sorting out <b>of</b> the destroyed <b>building</b> objects, that they are executed with the use of imperfect logistical support, which are not taken into account by character <b>of</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> objects and is based on the use <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> machines which do not answer the requirements of these processes, that results in considerable resource losses. Building machines with a multipurpose equipment, which provide the increase of efficiency of implementation of rescue and restoration works, are worked out. Methodology of determination of number of technique is worked out for providing of material-supply of sorting out <b>of</b> <b>destructions,</b> in particular on the initial stage of rescue works for liberation of victims from under obstructions...|$|R
2500|$|A similar {{effort was}} carried out by the United States Department of State in February 2002 {{entitled}} Images from Ground Zero. [...] The display included 27 images, detailing the September 11 attacks by Joel Meyerowitz that circulated, with the backing of embassies and consulates, to 60 nations. [...] The display was intended to shape and maintain the public memory of the attack and its aftermath. [...] The display sought to show the human side of the tragedy, and not just the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings.</b> [...] The display was also intended to show a story of recovery and resolution through documenting not only the grief and pain, but also the recovery efforts. [...] In many countries where the display was run, it was personalized for the population. [...] For example, relatives of those who died in the Towers were often invited to the event openings. [...] In this way, the US was able to put their own spin on the tragedy and keep the world from forgetting.|$|E
2500|$|After dark, the rearguard was {{withdrawn}} to Berbera with minimal losses and loading {{of the ships}} was completed {{in the early hours}} of 18 August, although the Australian light cruiser , with the force headquarters aboard, remained to collect stragglers and continue the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings,</b> vehicles, fuel and stores until the morning of 19 August, before sailing for Aden. Three sailors from Hobart, PO H. Jones, AB Hugh Sweeney and AB W. J. Hurren, took a QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss saluting gun on an improvised mounting to reinforce the defenders at Tug Argan. The sailors went missing and were feared dead but became the first Australian prisoners of war. In the evacuation, [...] were embarked, of whom [...] front-line troops, [...] civilians and [...] The local Somalis of the SCC had been given the choice of evacuation or disbandment, most chose to remain and were allowed to retain their arms.

2500|$|The earthquakes' {{epicentre}} were situated several kilometres north-northwest of Vila Franca, and had {{a maximum}} intensity of X (Very destructive) on the European macroseismic scale. This resulted in the movement of landforms above the settlement, resulting in landslides and lahar that moved [...] of material down the surrounding slopes, causing the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings,</b> deaths and inundated the settlement with debris. As a consequence almost {{the entirety of the}} settlement, between 3000 and 5000 people, were killed. In addition to the destruction of Vila Franca, the earthquake affected the neighbouring settlements, including Ponta Garça, Maia and Porto Formoso (where thousands were killed). A tsunami formed by the lahar caused the destruction of several boats that were located near the islet of Vila Franca, and the death of at most a hundred people. Gaspar Frutuoso, writing 70 years following the destruction, remembered a complete record of the events, writing a oral romance on Vila Franca.|$|E

40|$|The work {{provides}} a cause analysis for major industrial explosions and {{a review of}} the causes of combustive air-gas mixture generation in a production environment. It has been established that during operation of explosive production facilities, it is process equipment that, as a rule, creates explosive environment inside the floor area. A qualitative method for determination of a potential accident has been reviewed. Analysis of the nature of explosion effect on building structures and equipment has shown that exposions characterised by absence <b>of</b> equipment and <b>building</b> structure disintegration normally have a localized character. It has been identified that during explosions inside process equipment, the largest structural damage occurs in spots hit by equipment debris. Complete <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> structures and equipment is caused by explosions inside equipment containing large quantities of combustible products. It has been identified that most explosions are accompanied by partial or total <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> structures and equipment. Therefore, measures taken to protect equipment and buildings from explosion effects lack efficiency...|$|R
2500|$|In August 1965, the Watts Riots {{resulted}} in the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> up and down 103rd Street—the main commercial thoroughfare in Watts. [...] Watts Station was situated {{in the center of}} the one-mile (1.6km) stretch of 103rd Street between Compton and Wilmington Avenue that came to be known as [...] "Charcoal Alley" [...] due to the widespread destruction. [...] One observer recalled: [...] "Both sides of 103rd Street were ablaze now. The thoroughfare was a sea of flames that emitted heat so unbearable that I believed my skin was being seared off." [...] Another account of the riots along [...] "Charcoal Alley" [...] states: [...] "On the third day of the Watts Riots, 103rd St. was burned to the ground." [...] In the middle of the rubble and widespread destruction along [...] "Charcoal Alley", the Los Angeles Times reported that [...] "the train station was the only structure that remained intact when stores along 103rd Street burned during the Watts riots." [...] The survival of the old wood-framed Watts Station, whether an intentional omission or a mere coincidence, {{resulted in}} the station becoming, as the Los Angeles Times put it, [...] "a symbol of continuity, hope and renewal" [...] for the Watts community.|$|E
