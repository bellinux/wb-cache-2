At times, he nervously shook his microphone unconsciously.|$|E

25|$|In April 1903 an {{operation}} {{was performed by}} Sherren to divide two cutaneous nerves in Head's left forearm: the radial and the external. The regeneration of these nerves was charted {{over the next four}} years. Every Friday, Head would travel to Rivers' rooms in St John's College, Cambridge to conduct the experiments. It had soon become obvious that external distractions had an adverse effect on results and so Head sat every weekend with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> as Rivers charted the areas of sensitivity.|$|E

25|$|From 1978 to {{his death}} Cage worked at Crown Point Press, {{producing}} series of prints every year. The earliest project completed there was the etching Score Without Parts (1978), created from fully notated instructions, and based on various combinations of drawings by Henry David Thoreau. This was followed, the same year, by Seven Day Diary, which Cage drew with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> but which conformed to a strict structure developed using chance operations. Finally, Thoreau's drawings informed the last works produced in 1978, Signals.|$|E
25|$|In {{nearly every}} story, Wolfe solves the mystery by {{considering}} the facts brought to him by Archie and others, and the replies to questions he himself asks of suspects. Wolfe ponders with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> {{leaning back in his}} chair, breathing deeply and steadily, and pushing his lips in and out. Archie says that during these trances Wolfe reacts to nothing that is going on around him. Archie seldom interrupts Wolfe's thought processes, he says, largely because it is the only time that he can be sure that Wolfe is working.|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{had already}} {{established}} himself as a respected songwriter—other Melbourne musicians would go to see him on their nights off. Richard Guilliatt, writing for The Monthly, later described Kelly from a 1979 performance at Richmond's Kingston Hotel, the singer was [...] "a skinny guy with a head of black curls framing a pale face and a bent nose... singing with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> one arm outstretched and the other resting on the body of the Fender Telecaster". Kelly was introduced to Hilary Brown at one of the Dots' gigs and they later married – the relationship is described in [...] "When I First Met Your Ma" [...] (1992). Brown's father supplied Kelly with a gravy recipe – used on [...] "How to Make Gravy" [...] (1996). Their son, Declan, was born in 1980.|$|E

500|$|His pleas were in vain. [...] Three days later, Digby, Robert Wintour, John Grant and Thomas Bates were hanged, {{drawn and}} {{quartered}} {{at the western}} end of St Paul's churchyard. [...] The following day, Rookwood, Thomas Wintour, Robert Keyes and Guy Fawkes were tied to wattled hurdles and dragged by horse from the Tower, to the Old Palace Yard at Westminster—a longer route than had been suffered by their fellow conspirators. [...] Rookwood had asked to be informed when he passed by his lodgings in the Strand, so that he could open his eyes and see his wife, waiting at the window. [...] He shouted [...] "Pray for me, pray for me!" [...] According to Father Gerard (who was not then present), Elizabeth answered, [...] "I will, and be of good courage. [...] Offer theyself wholly to God. [...] I, for my part, do as freely restore thee to God as He gave thee unto me." [...] For the rest of the journey he kept <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> in prayer. [...] Thomas Wintour was the first that day to be hanged and then killed. [...] Rookwood was next, and made a short speech to the assembled audience. [...] He was repentant, asking God to bless the king, queen, and their [...] "royal progeny", but [...] "spoil all the pottage with one filthy weed" [...] by beseeching God to make the king a Catholic. [...] Nevertheless, he seems to have been left to hang for longer than the others, before suffering the remainder of his grim sentence.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{was a clear}} {{favourite}} to win the match, {{which took}} place on 17 January 1791 and attracted even more spectators than had been present for the Perrins fight. He had Joe Ward as his second and Mendoza as his bottle holder, with those roles for Bryan being filled by Warr and Humphries. The brutality of the initial fighting was shared by both men. Johnson's nerve failed him, as did his command of the techniques that had served him well. O'Hara describes that he fought [...] "like a wild man" [...] and, throwing caution to the wind, broke a metacarpal in his middle finger after the momentum created by throwing a wild punch caused him to crash into the ring rail {{and then to the}} floor. This was the turning point, and O'Hara describes the situation as, [...] "Frightfully beaten, his fists useless, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> bathed in blood, and without the chance even of turning the tide with a lucky punch, he refuses to surrender." [...] He had to resort to shifting once more and eventually to wrestling with the hair of Bryan, which generated much disapprobation among the crowd. Eventually Bryan forced Johnson to the floor and beat him unconscious. Johnson had lost the fight, and his status as champion, in 21minutes. Egan speculated that Johnson's change in style, evident from the outset of the fight might have been due to either genuine concern about Bryan's abilities or from his gambling problems; either way, [...] "there was a miserable falling off in him altogether!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Gradually {{during the}} course of the investigation, certain {{isolated}} spots of cutaneous sensibility began to appear; these spots were sensitive to heat, cold and pressure. However, the spaces between these spots remained insensitive at first, [...] unless sensations- such as heat or cold- reached above a certain threshold at which point the feeling evoked was unpleasant and usually perceived as being [...] "more painful" [...] than it was if the same stimulus was applied to Head's unaffected arm. Also, although the sensitive spots were quite definitely localised, Head, who sat through the tests with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> was unable to gain any exact appreciation of the locus of stimulation. Quite the contrary, the sensations radiated widely, and Head tended to refer them to places remote from the actual point of stimulation.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1941 All-Star Game, Williams batted fourth behind Joe DiMaggio, {{who was in}} {{the midst}} of his record-breaking hitting streak, having hit safely in 48 {{consecutive}} games. In the fourth inning Williams doubled to drive in a run. With the National League (NL) leading 5-2 in the eighth inning, Williams struck out in the middle of an American League (AL) rally. In the ninth inning the AL still trailed 5-3; Ken Keltner and Joe Gordon singled, and Cecil Travis walked to load the bases. DiMaggio grounded to the infield and Billy Herman, attempting to complete a double play, threw wide of first base, allowing Keltner to score. With the score 5-4 and runners on first and third, Williams homered with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> to secure a 7-5 AL win. Williams later said that that game-winning home run [...] "remains to this day the most thrilling hit of my life".|$|E
2500|$|Within the [...] "tale" [...] {{sections}} of the book, Peter, Martin, and Jack fall into bad company (becoming the official religion of the Roman empire) and begin altering their coats (faith) by adding ornaments. They then begin relying on Peter to be the arbitrator of the will. He begins to rule by authority (he remembered the handyman saying that he once heard the father {{say that it was}} acceptable to don more ornaments), until such a time that Jack rebels against the rule of Peter. Jack begins to read the will (the Bible) overly literally. He rips the coat to shreds to restore the original state of the garment which represents the [...] "primitive Christianity" [...] sought by dissenters. He begins to rely only upon [...] "inner illumination" [...] for guidance and thus walks around with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> after swallowing candle snuffs. Eventually, Peter and Jack begin to resemble one another, and only Martin is left with a coat that is at all like the original.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{more black}} youths, Johnny Robinson and Virgil Ware, were {{shot to death}} in Birmingham within seven hours of the Sunday morning bombing. Robinson, aged 16, was shot in the back by a {{policeman}} as he fled down an alley, after ignoring police orders to halt. The police were reportedly responding to black youths throwing rocks at cars driven by white people. Robinson died before reaching the hospital. Ware, aged 13, was shot in the cheek and chest with a revolver in a residential suburb 15 miles north of the city. A 16-year-old white youth named Larry Sims fired the gun (given to him by another youth named Michael Farley) at Ware, who was sitting on the handlebars of a bicycle ridden by his brother. Sims and Farley had been riding home from an anti-integration rally which had denounced the church bombing. When he spotted Ware and his brother, Sims fired twice, reportedly with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed.</b> (Sims and Farley were later convicted of second-degree manslaughter, although the judge suspended their sentences and imposed two years' probation upon each youth.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The accuser's 14-year-old brother Star {{testified that}} he'd walked into Jackson's bedroom and seen Jackson masturbating {{himself and the}} {{sleeping}} accuser. He testified that he'd meant {{to go to sleep}} in Jackson's room, had found the door [...] "kind of locked, so [...] pushed it, and it opened," [...] and he walked some ways into the room and stopped when he saw what Gavin and Michael were doing. He testified they were on the bed [...] "outside of the covers," [...] Jackson was on his back with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> and Gavin was [...] "curled up" [...] facing away from Jackson and was [...] "kind of snoring." [...] Star couldn't remember what his brother had been wearing but said it might have been [...] "pants or underwears," [...] and that Jackson was wearing [...] "socks, underwears, and an undershirt," [...] but later said Jackson's [...] "hand was in his pants." [...] He variously used the words [...] "pants" [...] and [...] "underwears" [...] for both Gavin and Jackson to describe what they were wearing. One aspect that weakened his testimony was that Star, the only witness to the alleged molestation, claimed he twice walked in on Jackson molesting Gavin and was completely unnoticed, even while tripping the alarm system in the hallway leading to Jackson's bedroom. An alarm or bell would sound whenever anyone approached, and Star claimed that on both occasions the alarm went off and Jackson didn't hear it. Neither did he hear nor see the boy come and go. Star said he stood watching for about four seconds before he [...] "just went back to the guest units." [...] Star testified that two days later he had an almost identical experience. He allegedly walked into Jackson's bedroom and saw that [...] "the same thing was happening," [...] with Jackson [...] "masturbating, stroking up and down" [...] and his other hand moving around in Star's sleeping [...] "brother's underwears." [...] This time Star only stayed for three seconds before returning to the guest units. Star's account of the sexual act on the second occasion matched neither the description he gave during an interview with psychologist Stanley Katz nor his statement given in police interviews in 2003. Star Arvizo {{said in an interview with}} the psychologist on May 29, 2003, that he witnessed Jackson placing his hand on Gavin's crotch outside his clothes. On July 7, 2003, during his first interview with sheriff's investigators, Star changed his story. He claimed that during the first incident Jackson placed his left hand under the front of his brother's pajama pants. Star Arvizo changed his account still a third time during a police interview on August 13, 2003, when he claimed that Jackson had placed his hand inside the front of his brother's boxer shorts. Dr. Katz' grand jury testimony about what Star had told him included a story about Jackson [...] "rubbing his penis against Gavin's buttocks" [...] and another about smelling marijuana. In court, Star denied that he'd made the allegations and refused Mesereau's offer to [...] "refresh [...] recollection [...] that page of [...] testimony." ...|$|E
