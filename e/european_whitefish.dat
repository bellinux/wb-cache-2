This includes observations of individuals in some populations that utilize brackish estuarine habitats as feeding areas, although information on these populations is generally scarce. By use of acoustic tracking technology and physiological sampling, the behaviour and salt water tolerance of <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> was therefore studied in the estuary and the adjacent fjords of the River Neiden in Northern Norway where individuals have earlier been captured in the estuary area. The results showed that <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> utilized the estuary extensively as a feeding habitat, with the capacity to stay for short periods in salinity concentration up to 30 ppt and with a mean water temperature of 15 ˚C. A correlation was found between their horizontal distribution along the estuary axis and the salt water influx following the tidal variations; fish were mainly using the lower estuary at lower salinity concentration following the tidal level, and retreat upstream with the salt water influx under high tide. This study therefore demonstrated that <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> at it northernmost distribution area can utilize the estuary extensively as a feeding area. There was also indications of that at least a few individuals could possibly cope with relatively high salinity concentration over some time. This is the first study that has mapped the individual behaviour of <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> in an estuarine area over time and therefore provides a better understanding on the ability of the species to cope with salt water habitat. Given that these populations are genetically unique, they should be given special management emphasis...|$|E
40|$|Lake Vättern {{has been}} {{contaminated}} {{with high levels}} of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) for decades, which could be due to the release of wastes from industries and urban communities surrounding the water system. This has especially had a negative effect on fatty fishes, which could accumulate large amounts of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and thereby also become a source of environmental toxicants to humans through consumption. Most PCB analysis only quantify a handful of congeners, the so called indicator-PCBs (I-PCBs), but this might leave out important information. In this study, an existing analytical method was improved by supplementing with additional congeners to detect a larger set of PCB congeners in Arctic char (Salvelinus salvelinus) and <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus acronius) caught from Lake Vättern, Sweden. New pre-packed multilayer silica columns from CAPE technologies were tested and used to pretreat the fish samples prior to analysis with a Gas Chromatograph coupled to low-resolution Mass Spectrometer using Atmospheric Pressure Ionization (API GC/MS). It was found that modifications of the clean up method for PCBs were necessary, such as lowering the amount of hexane in the washing step and combining the two eluent fractions. The Arctic char and the <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> showed a fat content of 0. 18 % and 0. 74 %, respectively. Concentrations of detected congeners ranged from 0. 5 to 1470 pg g- 1 fresh weight (fw) in Arctic char and varied between 1. 2 to 6550 pg g- 1 in <b>European</b> <b>whitefish.</b> For Arctic char and <b>European</b> <b>whitefish,</b> the WHO 2005 -TEQ values were 0. 4 pg g- 1 fw and 0. 6 pg g- 1 fw, respectively. The greatest total PCB concentration of 25900 pg g- 1 was measured in <b>European</b> <b>whitefish.</b> The total concentration of I-PCBs (# 28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180) was 3710 pg g- 1 for the Arctic char and 13900 e pg g- 1 for the <b>European</b> <b>whitefish.</b> All obtained results were lower than those reported from other studies. Constructed congener profiles show that the two species have similar ratios of PCB # 138 and # 153.

40|$|Development of morphs within <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus lavaretus), {{might be}} {{considered}} as a beginning of a sympatric speciation process. Unpublished data suggests that presence of the keystone piscivore northern pike (Esox lucius) is the main driver of sympatric divergence in <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus lavaretus). Using introduced whitefish populations as controlled experiments, it is possible to determine when different characters diverge in the speciation process. In this study, I analysed age and growth within <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> populations of different age to assess if these characters change over time in absence of pike. With using otoliths from whitefish populations of different age, I was possible to determine individual age, and by measuring the length of the fish, growth was calculated. Whitefish populations in lakes without northern pike had rapid growth to maturity and decreased growth afterward, furthermore regression analysis showed no correlations between age and growth measurements, and time since introduction. This suggests that there are no divergences in monomorphic whitefish populations. Compared with outcome from studies of polymorphic populations of whitefish, characters have been observed to differ between morphs, but age and growth of whitefish did not change with the age of populations in lakes with pike, as in lakes without pike. This suggests that other factors influences the changes in whitefish or that it may occur outside the investigated time span...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to test for price parity across {{different}} species of <b>whitefish</b> in the <b>European</b> Union. Price parity is defined by a system of cointegrated prices and would be evidence of a single <b>European</b> market for <b>whitefish.</b> Whitefish are of interest because EU fishers receive the largest share of their income from these fish species. Notwithstanding the single market policy of the EU, by establishing national and regional associations to stabilize or increase the local price of fish, fishers operate as if the European market is made up of separate submarkets with price being determined largely within each submarket. If whitefish markets were price cointegrated such associations would be largely ineffective. In that case, what are required are regulations that encompass the European market. ...|$|R
40|$|Central <b>European</b> lake <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus spp.) colonized Swiss lakes {{following}} the last glacial retreat and have undergone rapid speciation and adaptive radiation. Up to six {{species have been}} shown to coexist in some lakes, and individual species occupy specific ecological niches and have distinct feeding and reproductive ecologies. We studied methylmercury (MeHg) accumulation in sympatric whitefish species from seven Swiss lakes to determine if ecological divergence has led to different rates of MeHg bioaccumulation. In four of seven lakes, sympatric species had distinctly different MeHg levels, which varied by up to a factor of two between species. Generally, species with greater MeHg levels were smaller in body size and planktivorous, and species with lower MeHg were larger and benthivorous. While modest disparities in trophic position between species might be expected a priori to explain the divergence in MeHg, δ 15 N of bulk tissue did not correlate with fish MeHg in five of seven lakes. Results of a nested ANCOVA analysis across all lakes indicated that only two factors (species, lake) explained substantial portions of the variance, with species accounting for more variance (52 %) than inter-lake differences (32 %). We suggest that differences in MeHg accumulation were likely caused by diverging metabolic traits between species, such as differences in energy partitioning between anabolism and catabolism, potentially interacting with species-specific prey resource utilization. These results indicate substantial variability in MeHg accumulation between closely related fish species, illustrating that ecological speciation in fish can lead to divergent MeHg accumulation patterns...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Adaptive {{radiation}} within fishes of the Coregonus lavaretus complex {{has created}} numerous morphs, posing significant challenges for taxonomy and conservation priorities. The highly endangered North Sea houting (C. oxyrhynchus; abbreviated NSH) {{has been considered}} a separate species from <b>European</b> lake <b>whitefish</b> (C. lavaretus; abbreviated ELW) due to morphological divergence and adaptation to oceanic salinities. However, its evolutionary and taxonomic status is controversial. We analysed microsatellite DNA polymorphism in nine populations from the Jutland Peninsula and the Baltic Sea, representing NSH (three populations, {{two of which are}} reintroduced) and ELW (six populations). The objectives were to: 1) analyse postglacial recolonization of whitefish in the region; 2) assess the evolutionary distinctiveness of NSH, and 3) apply several approaches for defining conservation units towards setting conservation priorities for NSH. Results Bayesian cluster analyses of genetic differentiation identified four major groups, corresponding to NSH and three groups of ELW (Western Jutland, Central Jutland, Baltic Sea). Estimates of historical migration rates indicated recolonization in a north-eastern direction, suggesting that all except the Baltic Sea population predominantly represent postglacial recolonization via the ancient Elbe River. Contemporary gene flow has not occurred between NSH and ELW, with a divergence time within the last 4, 000 years suggested from coalescence methods. NSH showed interbreeding with ELW when brought into contact by stocking. Thus, reproductive isolation of NSH was not absolute, although possible interbreeding beyond the F 1 level could not be resolved. Conclusion Fishes of the C. lavaretus complex in the Jutland Peninsula originate from the same recolonization event. NSH has evolved recently and its species status may be questioned due to incomplete reproductive isolation from ELW, but it was shown to merit consideration as an independent conservation unit. Yet, application of several approaches for defining conservation units generated mixed outcomes regarding its conservation priority. Within the total species complex, it remains one among many recently evolved unique forms. Its uniqueness and high conservation priority is more evident at a local geographical scale, where conservation efforts will also benefit populations of a number of other endangered species. </p...|$|R

Under natural conditions, 15 and 25 weeks correspond to weight gains of 75 % and 100 % (i. e. doubling), respectively. Also, the fatty acid profile of the fish was restored after finishing periods of 15 and 25 weeks. Limiting the use of fish oil by lowering the overall fat content of the feed (no vegetable oil added) resulted in {{a decrease in the}} long-chain n- 3 fatty acids.

In northern Fennoscandia, <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus lavaretus (L.)) is a highly polymorphic species displaying adaptive radiations into partially reproductively isolated and thus genetically differentiated sympatric morphs utilizing the planktivorous and benthivorous food niche in many lakes. In 1993, Lake Skrukkebukta was invaded by vendace (Coregonus albula (L.)) which is a zooplanktivorous specialist. The vendace displaced the densely rakered whitefish from its preferred pelagic niche to the benthic habitat harbouring the large sparsely rakered whitefish. In this study, we investigate the potential influence of the vendace invasion on the breakdown of reproductive isolation between the two whitefish morphs. We inferred the genotypic and phenotypic differentiation between the two morphs collected at the arrival (1993) and 15 years after (2008) the vendace invasion using 16 microsatellite loci and gill raker numbers, the most distinctive adaptive phenotypic trait between them. The comparison of gill raker number distributions revealed two modes growing closer over 15 years following the invasion.

General linear regression models showed the ecoregion and lake altitude being the best predictors of fish species richness. The number of species was significantly higher in the Alpine than in the Mediterranean ecoregion. Among Alpine lakes, the number of fish species increased significantly with lake volume whilst decreased with altitude. In the Mediterranean lakes, none of the selected parameters was significant. Cluster analysis of fish assemblages (presence/ absence) divided the lakes of the Alpine and Mediterranean ecoregions into four and two types, respectively. Pike (Esox lucius), rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus) and tench (Tinca tinca) were the main indicator species for the small and mostly shallow lakes in both the Alpine (Type 1) and Mediterranean (Type 6) ecoregions, minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) for the alpine high altitude lakes (Type 2) and landlocked shad (Alosa fallax lacustris), <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus lavaretus) and burbot (Lota lota) for the large and very deep alpine lakes (Type 4).

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} behind speciation {{have been}} subject of debate for centuries. The presence of resource polymorphism has been discovered to play a significant part in this process, and has been proven to induce phenotypic and genetic divergence. Although resource polymorphism has been intensely studied {{during the last few}} decades, there is a gap of information as to why this can be observed in some systems but not in others. Recent studies of <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus lavaretus) in Scandinavian lakes have shown that predation, in this case by Northern pike (Esox lucius), could be the factor that induces resource polymorphism. <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> is known to diverge into several ecomorphs in Scandinavian lakes, but only in the presence of pike. Divergence is assumed to be caused by the size selectivity of pike, and the following niche separation and eventually reproductive isolation. In this study, pike prey selectivity was studied in the field through sample fishing using hooks baited with whitefish of different sizes. The hypothesis was that pike prefers smaller prey over larger and mainly hunts in the littoral zone. This should causes smaller whitefish ecomorphs to be prone to predation in the littoral and thus utilize refuge spawning grounds with low predation pressure. However, no pike were caught on whitefish spawning grounds, and fishing at two additional pike rich sites displayed a preference towards medium-sized whitefish (p < 0. 05). This indicates a size selectivity, although further and improved studies would be required to answer the question of the pike’s role in resource polymorphism...|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic activities, such as {{introduction}} of non-native species, is {{considered as one}} of the most significant causes for declining biodiversity, since such introduction may destabilise ecological barriers to gene flow between native populations. In the 1960 s a salmonid fish, vendace, was introduced to the upper parts of Pasvik watercourse and during the early 1990 s it invaded the entire watercourse, including the lakes studied in this project/thesis. These lakes harbour an eco-morph pair of <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> that has diverged in sympatry in post-glacial times. The vendace, being a competitively superior planktivore to the densely rakered eco-morph, relegated this eco-morph from its native pelagic habitat into the non-native littoral habitat, which is mainly occupied by the large sparsely rakered eco-morph. These observations have inspired this PhD thesis to study the phenotypic, genetic, and genomic consequences of the vendace invasion on native sympatric <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> eco-morphs. Using neutral microsatellite markers, the study documented that the introduction and invasion of vendace have induced speciation reversal in the eco-morph pair. The comparison of the number of gill rakers from the pre- and post-invasion periods revealed merging of two peaks of distribution of number of gill rakers following the invasion suggesting reduction in discreteness of phenotypes. Population genomic analyses, using genome-wide coverage of SNP markers obtained by sequencing of restriction site associated DNA libraries (RADseq), revealed an unpredicted outcome of speciation reversal at the genomic and functional phenotypic levels. This was attributed to a change in the selective forces during speciation reversal. The introgression patterns at genomic regions of adaptive importance, showed that speciation reversal have unpredictable consequences on introgression. Overall, this PhD study concludes that anthropogenic activities have wide-ranging and stochastic effects for species undergoing speciation reversal...|$|E

In ecological speciation, natural selection drives the evolution of slight distinctions between individuals into extensive differences between species. In this thesis, early stages of an ecologically driven speciation process are addressed using ecological and morphological data from {{a large number of}} <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus lavaretus) populations in northern Fennoscandia. Northern Fennoscandia is an area scattered with lakes created during the glacial retreat (~ 10 - 12 kyr BP). Many of these lakes are inhabited by one or up to three different morphs of whitefish. As many other temperate freshwater fishes, whitefish typically diverge into pelagic and littoral resource specialists, the densely rakered (DR) and the large sparsely rakered (LSR) morph, respectively. Parallel within-lake divergence is the most probable origin of these sympatric morphs. In addition, a third whitefish morph (the small sparsely rakered; SSR), specializing on profundal resources, was recently described in a few lakes in the area. The aims of this thesis were to explore and document the phenotypic diversity of whitefish in northern Fennoscandia, and to investigate some of the factors limiting the level of diversity reached within each lake. Further, the ability of LSR whitefish morphs to utilize profundal resources was explored, as this is a probable origin of profundal specialist SSR morphs. Based on the distribution of gill raker number, a temporally stable morphological trait in the studied populations, I have documented a continuum of increasing diversity in northern Fennoscandian whitefish. This whitefish diversity comprises mono (only LSR), di- (LSR and DR), and tri-morphic (LSR, DR and SSR) populations, in addition to intermediate stages between them. Within three different lakes with dimorphic whitefish populations, some individuals of the LSR morph were specialized to exploit profundal resources. This could indicate an incipient evolution towards a profundal specialist morph (SSR) in some dimorphic lakes. Ecological opportunity (lake size and productivity) is likely a prerequisite for whitefish to diverge, although limitations related to the colonization history also were present. In conclusion, there is astonishing parallel divergence in ecology, morphology and genetics along a continuum of increasing diversity in whitefish. Thus, ecologically-based natural selection is likely driving the divergence, promoting reproductive isolation and incipient ecological speciation in northern Fennoscandian whitefish populations...|$|E

Biochemical analysis showed the presence of Chain A, RNase ZF- 3 e proteins in the chorion of water-hardened but not non-water hardened eggs. Histochemical staining of the chorion of C. lavaretus eggs showed that the externa, but not the interna, stained positively {{for the presence of}} glycoproteins. From these results, it was concluded that C. lavaretus from Loch Eck possess both anatomical and biochemical adhesive mechanisms that have been undocumented in this species so far...|$|E

40|$|Parallel {{phenotypic}} evolution {{occurs when}} independent populations evolve similar traits {{in response to}} similar selective regimes. However, populations inhabiting similar environments also frequently show some phenotypic differences that result from non-parallel evolution. In this study, we quantified {{the relative importance of}} parallel evolution to similar foraging regimes and nonparallel lake-specific effects on morphological variation in <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus lavaretus). We found evidence for both lake-specific morphological characteristics and parallel morphological divergence between whitefish specializing in feeding on profundal and littoral resources in three separate lakes. Foraging specialists expressed similar phenotypes in different lakes in both overall body shape and selected measured morphological traits. The morphology of the two whitefish specialists resembled that predicted from other fish species, supporting the conclusion of an adaptive significance of the observed morphological characteristics. Our results indicate that divergent natural selection resulting from foraging specialization is driving and/or maintaining the observed parallel morphological divergence. Whitefish in this study may represent an early stage of divergence towards the evolution of specialized morphs...|$|E

40|$|Feeding {{success is}} a key factor for larval growth and survival, and is highly {{dependent}} on small-scale processes which occur during the predator-prey interaction. We studied the feeding mechanisms involved in the capture success of the <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus lavaretus) larvae using video recordings. The successful predatory sequence of this species consists of the following 5 events: encounter, pursuit (including fixation), strike, capture and ingestion. C. lavaretus larvae can exhibit an “S” shaped posture and always strikes on its prey from beyond. The mean fixation distance for wild larvae was 1. 75 ± 0. 71 mm and for reared larvae was 1. 65 ± 0. 76 mm. This distance was significantly different between failed and successful snaps, {{and seemed to be}} an important parameter to the capture success of C. lavaretus larvae. The analysis of the complexity in predator’s swimming path showed that more convoluted approaches are less likely to lead to a fruitful attack...|$|E
40|$|Ecological {{speciation}} - whereby an ancestral founder species diversifies to fill vacant niches - is {{a phenomenon}} characteristic of newly formed ecosystems. Despite such ubiquity, ecosystem-level effects of such divergence remain poorly understood. Here, we compared the trophic niche of <b>European</b> <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus lavaretus) and their predators {{in a series of}} contrasting subarctic lakes where this species had either diversified into four ecomorphologically distinct morphs or instead formed monomorphic populations. We found that the trophic niche of whitefish was almost three times larger in the polymorphic than in the monomorphic lakes, due to an increase in intraspecific specialisation. This trophic niche expansion was mirrored in brown trout (Salmo trutta), a major predator of whitefish. This represents amongst the first evidence for ecological speciation directly altering the trophic niche of a predator. We suggest such mechanisms may be a common and important - though presently overlooked - factor regulating trophic interactions in diverse ecosystems globally...|$|E
