5|$|Bill C-19 (previously Bill S-4) titled An Act {{to amend}} the Constitution Act, 1867 (Senate tenure) was a bill to limit new Senators' tenure to eight-year terms. Currently, {{senators}} can stay in office until they reach the age of 75. The bill was first introduced {{by the government in}} the Senate on May 30, 2006. After consideration in committee and making amendments to the bill, the Senate recommended that the bill not be proceeded with until such time as the Supreme Court of Canada had ruled with respect to its constitutionality, which <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>occurred</b> prior to dissolution. The bill was reintroduced in the second session as a Commons bill on November 13, 2007, but did not become law before the session ended.|$|E
5|$|The 1964 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured {{the highest number}} of U.S.-landfalling hurricanes since 1933. The season officially began on June15, and lasted until November30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The season was slightly above average, with twelve total storms and six hurricanes. All of the hurricanes strengthened into major hurricanes, an event that <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>occurred</b> since 1930. The first system, an unnamed tropical storm, developed on June2, almost two weeks before the official start of the season. Striking Florida on June6, the storm brought localized flooding to portions of Cuba and the Southeastern United States, leaving about $1million in damage. The next storm, also unnamed, developed near the end of July; it did not impact land.|$|E
5|$|In February 2003, Love {{was banned}} from Virgin Airlines by founder Richard Branson after being arrested at Heathrow Airport for disrupting a flight. In October of that year, {{in the midst}} of what Love would later admit was a serious cocaine and {{prescription}} drug addiction, she was arrested in Los Angeles after breaking several windows of her producer and then-boyfriend James Barber's home, and was charged with being under the influence of a controlled substance; the ordeal resulted in her losing custody of her daughter. On March 18, 2004, Love was arrested in New York City for allegedly striking a 24-year-old male fan with a microphone stand at a concert at the Bowery Ballroom. Four days later, on March 22, Love called in multiple times to The Howard Stern Show, making various claims and speaking erratically; in broadcast conversations with Stern, she claimed that the incident with the fan <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>occurred,</b> and that actress Natasha Lyonne, who was at the concert, was told by the alleged victim that he had been paid $10,000 to file a false claim leading to Love's arrest. She pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in October 2004.|$|E

5|$|Initially Los Alamos was to {{have been}} a {{military}} laboratory with Oppenheimer and other researchers commissioned into the Army. Oppenheimer {{went so far as to}} order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform, but two key physicists, Robert Bacher and Isidor Rabi, balked at the idea. Conant, Groves and Oppenheimer then devised a compromise whereby the laboratory was operated by the University of California. Financial and procurement activities were the responsibility of the University of California under a 1 January 1943 letter of intent from the OSRD. This was superseded by a formal contract with the Manhattan District on 20 April 1943, which was backdated to 1 January. Financial operations were directed by the resident business officer, J. A. D. Muncy. The intent was that it would be militarized when the time came to finally assemble the bomb, but by this time the Los Alamos Laboratory had grown so large that this was considered both impractical and unnecessary, as the anticipated difficulties regarding civilians working on dangerous tasks <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>occurred.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{were small}} {{enclaves}} of Mi'kmaq {{in and around}} the coves of Bedford Basin on the Dartmouth shore. Directly opposite to Pier 9 on the Halifax side sat a community in Tufts Cove, also known as Turtle Grove. The settlement, dating back to the 18th century, had been a subject of controversy because white settler landowners wanted to remove the Mi'kmaq residents. In the years and months preceding the explosion, the Department of Indian Affairs had been actively trying to force the Mi'kmaq to give up their land, though this <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>occurred</b> {{by the time of the}} explosion. The fire aboard Mont-Blanc drew the attention of many onlookers on both sides of the harbour. The physical structures of the settlement were obliterated by the explosion and tsunami. While a precise Mi'kmaq death toll is unknown, records show that nine bodies were recovered, and the settlement was not rebuilt in the wake of the disaster. The Halifax Remembrance Book lists 16 members of the Tufts Cove Community as deceased, although not all the dead listed as in Tufts Cove were Indigenous. Survivors were housed in a racially segregated building under generally poor conditions and eventually dispersed around Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day the}} Fusiliers again {{assaulted}} Hill 217 {{from the}} south, and attempted {{to work their way}} around the eastern and western flanks of the feature. Despite preparation by the divisional artillery and the 3 RAR Machine Gun Platoon firing their Vickers medium machine-guns in support from Maryang San, the Fusiliers were unable to make progress due to Chinese machine-guns located in bunkers {{at the top of their}} objective. Meanwhile, their flanking movements were also blocked by Chinese small arms and grenades. 1 RNF had now taken over 100 casualties during two days of fighting and by the afternoon they were a spent force. Sensing the Fusiliers' weakness, the Chinese then launched their own assault, forcing them to withdraw in contact. Previous plans for an assault on the Hinge <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>occurred</b> due to issues with resupply and the dangerous approach march that would have been required. Again, despite their efforts, the Fusiliers had failed to capture their objective. It seemed that the only way to finally secure Hill 217 was along the ridge from Hill 317, via the Hinge, and as such the Australians would be tasked with capturing the Hinge the following day. B Company was subsequently allocated the attack. In preparation, they ascended Hill 317 late in the afternoon of 6 October, finally securing the crest, and at last light joined 9 Platoon on the knoll northwest of the summit where they would form up the next day to conduct the assault.|$|E

5|$|Franklin Pierce won {{the presidential}} election, and in 1853 made Davis his Secretary of War. In this capacity, Davis began the Pacific Railroad Surveys {{in order to}} {{determine}} various possible routes for the proposed Transcontinental Railroad. He promoted the Gadsden Purchase of today's southern Arizona from Mexico, partly because it would provide an easier southern route for the new railroad; the Pierce administration agreed, and the land was purchased in December 1853. He saw the size of the regular army as insufficient to fulfill its mission, and maintained that salaries would have to be increased, something which <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>occurred</b> for 25 years. Congress agreed and increased the pay scale, and added four regiments which increased the army's size from about 11,000 to about 15,000. Davis also introduced general usage of the rifles that he had used successfully during the Mexican–American War. As a result, both the morale and capability of the army was improved. He became involved in public works when Pierce gave him responsibility for construction of the Washington Aqueduct and an expansion of the U.S. Capitol, both of which he managed closely. The Pierce administration ended in 1857 after Pierce's loss of the Democratic nomination to James Buchanan. Davis's term was to end with Pierce's, so he ran for the Senate, was elected, and re-entered it on March 4, 1857.|$|E

25|$|By February 2007, {{the land}} swap {{agreement}} {{still had not}} been finalized. The zoning changes <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>occurred,</b> although city officials pledged they were coming. No agreement over parking garage management had been signed, either. The city declined {{to get involved in}} operation of the hotel, and advised Gould to negotiate with Marriott about parking garage management. The long negotiations triggered the late-fee clause that required the city to pay Gould $2.2 million. This, too, delayed the swap, since payment of fees greater than $1 million required city council approval. In September, Gould and the city public accused each other of stalling the deal.|$|E

Niittymäki won four straight games in February 2010, something that <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>occurred</b> for Tampa Bay since {{two and a half years}} prior, when the team won five straight in the 2007–08 season (November).

25|$|Hayden's {{efforts to}} gain {{approval}} for the Central Arizona Project continued into the 1950s. Hayden and McFarland reintroduced their previous legislation in 1951 but it was again defeated in the House, this time due to concerns that full appropriation of Colorado waters <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>occurred.</b> The legislative setback prompted Arizona to file suit in the United States Supreme Court seeking adjudication of the water rights issue. The case, Arizona v. California, was accepted by the court on January 19, 1953 and would take over a decade to decide. In other reclamation efforts Hayden cosponsored the Colorado River Storage Act of 1956, authorizing construction of the Glen Canyon Dam and three other water storage dams.|$|E

Kesselring hoped to draw out and disperse Park's defences by sending out large numbers of single Staffeln. With {{the exception of the}} early morning, Park did not take the bait.

25|$|It is {{not known}} exactly how many people died {{during the period of}} the famine, {{although}} it is believed that more died from disease than from starvation. State registration of births, marriages, or deaths had not yet begun, and records kept by the Roman Catholic Church are incomplete. One possible estimate has been reached by comparing the expected population with the eventual numbers in the 1850s. A census taken in 1841 recorded a population of 8,175,124. A census immediately after the famine in 1851 counted 6,552,385, a drop of over 1.5 million in 10 years. The census commissioners estimated that, at the normal rate of population increase, the population in 1851 should have grown to just over 9 million if the famine <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>occurred.</b>|$|E
