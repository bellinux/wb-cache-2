500|$|Howard {{informed}} the Wiccan Lois Bourne — {{whom he met}} when she was holidaying near his second home, an old mill in Cornwall — that the Head of Atho {{had been in the}} possession of his family for many generations. Conversely, he told Valiente a different story about its origins: according to this account, Howard was living with relations on a Norfolk farm in 1930 when he met an old lady named Alicia Franch who lived with the Romani Gypsies. Franch allegedly first came across Howard when he was playing by a roadside pond on the summer solstice, and she took an interest in him, instructing him in her witchcraft tradition and leaving him a number of artefacts in her will, including the Head of Atho. In a newspaper interview with the Eastern Evening News he identified Swaffham as the location in which this had happened, adding that the old lady had left him a <b>deed</b> <b>box</b> containing [...] "teeth, nail parings and old parchments. The historian Ronald Hutton later commented that there was [...] "no means of investigating this story", but added that Howard could not be considered a trustworthy source.|$|E
60|$|Aynesworth {{was back}} {{in less than an}} hour. He carried under his arm a brown paper parcel, the strings of which he {{commenced}} at once to untie. Wingrave, who had been engrossed in the contents of his <b>deed</b> <b>box,</b> watched him with immovable face.|$|E
60|$|Wingrave {{turned away}} with a little gasp; a half-stifled exclamation had crept out from between his teeth. His cheeks seemed paler than ever, and his eyes unnaturally bright. Nevertheless, he was {{completely}} master of himself. On the table was a large <b>deed</b> <b>box</b> of papers, which Rocke had left for his inspection. From its recesses he drew out a smaller box, unlocked it with a key from his chain, and emptied its sole contents--a small packet of letters--upon the table. He counted them one by one. They were all there--and on top a photograph. A breath of half-forgotten perfume stole out into the room. He opened one of the letters, and its few passionate words came back to his memory, linked with a hundred other recollections, the desire of her eyes, of her lips raised for his, the caressing touch of her fingers. He found himself wondering, in an impersonal sort of way, that these things should so little affect him. His blood ran no less coldly, nor did his pulses beat the faster, for this backward glance into things finished.|$|E
60|$|He did not gulp as untrained men do {{when they}} lie, but his jaws moved stickily, and his eyes, turning towards the <b>deed</b> <b>boxes</b> on the wall, dulled. I counted seconds, one, two, three--one, two, three up to ten. A man, I knew, can live through ages of mental {{depression}} in that time.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He deserves nothing better,' {{answered}} the beggar, 'for {{it was an}} ill <b>deed.</b> Still that <b>box</b> is too small for him, for he is a big man.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{promotion}} instructed {{people to}} mail a form {{along with a}} box top from either Quaker Puffed Wheat, Quaker Puffed Rice or Muffets Shredded Wheat to the Quaker Oats company. In turn, a 5 by 8 inch deed to one square inch {{of land in the}} Klondike was sent back. In February 1955, Quaker Oats was blocked from trading the <b>deed</b> for a <b>box</b> top by the Ohio Securities Division until it received a state license for the [...] "sale" [...] of foreign land. To get around the injunction, the company stopped the trade-in offer and instead put one of the <b>deeds</b> in each <b>box</b> of cereal produced.|$|R
5000|$|In 1897 Morrison {{published}} seven {{short stories}} detailing {{the exploits of}} Horace Dorrington. In contrast to Morrison's earlier character Martin Hewitt, who one critic described as [...] "low-key, realistic, lower-class answer to Sherlock Holmes," [...] Dorrington was [...] "a respected but deeply corrupt private detective," [...] "a cheerfully unrepentant sociopath {{who is willing to}} stoop to theft, blackmail, fraud or cold-blooded murder to make a dishonest penny." [...] These stories were collected into a book titled The Dorrington <b>Deed</b> <b>Box,</b> also published in 1897.|$|E
