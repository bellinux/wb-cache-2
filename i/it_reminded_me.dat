500|$|Growing up in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé was {{surrounded}} by the Spanish language, and learned some Spanish as a child, which she later forgot. When re-recording songs for Irreemplazable, Beyoncé's vocal coach provided the Spanish lyrics phonetically, and each line was recorded up to four times for the EP. Beyoncé has stated that she intends to take up Spanish lessons in the future. She said of the EP's recording, [...] "This is such an honor {{for me to be}} able to connect with all my fans. I had so much fun singing in Spanish. <b>It</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of growing up in Houston". The Denver Post John Wenzel interpreted the release of Irreemplazable as [...] "an effort to meet the exploding market for Spanish language music".|$|E
500|$|Tung's men charged {{forward in}} a V-shaped riot formation. According to Halberstam, [...] "they pranced into the pagoda, looking {{something}} like a smart football team coming up {{to the line of}} scrimmage". In the end, it took around two hours to complete the raids because many of the occupants had entrenched themselves inside the various rooms in anticipation of the attacks and doors had to be unhinged to reach them. According to journalist Neil Sheehan, who was at the scene, [...] "The raid on Xá Lợi, like those on the pagodas elsewhere in South Vietnam, was flawlessly executed. <b>It</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of a scene from a movie of the French Resistance—the scene when the Gestapo arrive at the Resistance hideout in Paris." [...] William Prochnau said that [...] "Using the elite guard against the Buddhists was analogous to using Green Berets to put down Negro protests at home. It was outrageous." ...|$|E

[...] Weinberg became the live drummer for 10,000 Maniacs in 1992 after their drummer Jerry Augustyniak was injured five days before a five-week tour. He went after that {{assignment}} once he heard it was open and later said, [...] "I lived on a bus and had a roommate. Not exactly like the E Street Band, but I loved it. <b>It</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> that I am a drummer and I'm good. I was put here to play the drums. To {{turn my back on}} that ability was wrong." [...] He played at the January 1993 inauguration of Bill Clinton. Weinberg auditioned in 1993 to be the principal drummer on the Broadway show The Who's Tommy, but was selected instead as the second substitute. Despite the very low pay, Weinberg was nevertheless happy: [...] "I'd buried drumming so far into my psyche. I felt I'd resurrected it." [...] Of Springsteen's work, Weinberg felt [...] "that I would never get to play these songs again." ...|$|E

500|$|Astronaut Buzz Aldrin {{called the}} visual effects [...] "remarkable", and said, [...] "I was so extravagantly {{impressed}} by the portrayal {{of the reality of}} zero gravity. Going through the space station was done just the way that I've seen people do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen—maybe not quite that vigorous—but certainly we've been fortunate that people haven't been in those situations yet. I think it reminds us that there really are hazards in the space business, especially in activities outside the spacecraft." [...] Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman said, [...] "The pace and story was definitely engaging and I think it was the best use of the 3-D IMAX medium to date. Rather than using the medium as a gimmick, Gravity uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people. But the question that most people want me to answer is, how realistic was it? The very fact that the question is being asked so earnestly {{is a testament to the}} verisimilitude of the movie. When a bad science fiction movie comes out, no one bothers to ask me if <b>it</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of the real thing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} 7 Khoon Maaf came when Ruskin Bond sent his book of Short Story {{collection}} to Vishal Bhardwaj. He {{was intrigued by}} a four-page story's title named [...] "Susanna's Seven Husbands", and thought it had potential for a novel and a film. Bhardwaj said, [...] "I told myself why would a woman have seven husbands and then I came {{to know that she}} also kills them! I was immediately hooked to it. <b>It</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of a very old film, Bluebeard's Seven Wives". Bhardwaj suggested the story to a fellow director, who was looking for a good story. However, after reading the short story, the director dismissed it saying it has no film potential. After reading the story twice, he became even more confident about possibility of a film. Bhardwaj who had previously adapted Bond's novel The Blue Umbrella into a film, decided to adapt the short story for the screen. Bhardwaj later requested Bond to turn the story into a novella, noting that only Bond could flesh out the characters well, to which he agreed. Bond expanded the story into an 80-page novella, which later became a 200-page full-length Hindi script. Bhardwaj co-wrote the script with Matthew Robbins.|$|E

[...] The walls of Juno's room are covered with posters of bands, while Leah's room includes a mural of older men whom she finds attractive, and Paulie's room is designed to be overly childlike to indicate his innocence. Production designer Steve Saklad designed Mark and Vanessa's house with the assumption that [...] "Vanessa has probably read every home magazine and tried to copy what's in them as best she could." [...] Costume designer Monique Prudhomme was nominated for a Costume Designers Guild Award in the [...] "Excellence in Contemporary Costume Design for Film" [...] category. She dressed Vanessa in clothes that were [...] "simple and very tasteful" [...] but with an [...] "anal-retentive quality," [...] while dressing Mark in conservative clothing that complements Vanessa's taste. It was Page's suggestion that Juno wear flannel shirts and sweater-vests. Page also had to wear two sizes of prosthetic belly fitted like a corset in the back, as well as a third [...] "real" [...] belly that is seen when Juno has an ultrasound and a variety of sizes of fake breasts. The footage displayed on Juno's ultrasound monitor is of supervising sound designer Scott Sanders's son Matthew and was embedded into the scene in post-production.|$|E
500|$|Following a {{long time}} of hiatus in her acting career, Cher was {{announced}} to be returned on the musical film Burlesque (2010) co-starring Christina Aguilera. This {{was the first time}} Cher appeared on the screen since Stuck on You (2003). Talking about the making of the film, Cher revealed, [...] "It’s harder to do things. I've beat my body up so badly, it's amazing it's still talking to me and listening to what I say. But I’ve got aches and pains everywhere." [...] The soundtrack was also revealed, with eight songs performed by Aguilera, and two songs by Cher: [...] "Welcome to Burlesque" [...] and [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me". During an interview with a California journal, Cher commented about [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me", [...] "That song, for me, had a lot of meaning. <b>It</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> that I have to kind of move over." [...] She also spoke about the track with the Fresno Bee, saying [...] "Not that I'm doing it gracefully, because you'd have to pull me over kicking and screaming." [...] In the United States, the song was released to adult contemporary radio station on January 15, 2011 the first single from the soundtrack. In order to promote the song, several promotional remixes were made by Almighty, Dave Aude and StoneBridge. The remix EP, which contains uptempo dance versions of the track, was released onto iTunes Stores on November 24, 2010. The remix done by StoneBridge was released as a single on December 7, 2010. The song is also included in Cher's 25th studio album, Closer to the Truth (deluxe edition).|$|E
500|$|After the UK release, Dickon Stainer, head of Universal Classics and Jazz, {{spoke of}} plans to {{publicise}} Faryl in the US, saying [...] "America {{is going to}} be key. Because of her history on the talent show there's already a great deal of interest in her. The demand is intense." [...] In April 2009, Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of Faryl in the US. She appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in early May as part of her promotional tour. Faryl was released in the US on 5 May. Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well {{as it did in the}} UK. She said that [...] "in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known. In the UK, a lot of people obviously watched 'Britain's Got Talent' and stuff, and that was like fresh in everyone's minds." [...] After the release, she was more optimistic, saying [...] "hen I performed in New York, <b>it</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of the HMV signing in Kettering and there was quite a big queue so I think my album was well received." [...] Smith returned from the US in early May. Despite the contrary being said when she performed on the third series of Britain's Got Talent, Smith had no plans for a concert tour in 2009; she was quoted as saying that [...] "I'm too young and don't think I would be able to do a tour on my own". However, she did plan to return to the US during her summer holidays to again promote Faryl. She said that [...] "everyone in America was really nice and they do like classical music, but it is so difficult to make it over there ... They seem to like their own singers, but I will just keep trying my best". However, she instead took a short break from her music career in summer, before returning to the recording studio later in the year for Wonderland, her second album, which was released in November.|$|E

It responds to the novel's notes of apocalypse and dystopia, and its disclosure of a spiritual desert within the modern city, but also to its persistent qualities of fable, paradox and even whimsy." [...] "Blindness is a drum-tight drama, with superb, hallucinatory, images of urban collapse. It has a real coil of horror at its centre, yet is lightened with gentleness and humour. <b>It</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of George A Romero's Night of the Living Dead, and Peter Shaffer's absurdist stage-play Black Comedy.

Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune wrote: [...] "In Italy, it remains one of Fellini's most consistently loved movies. It should be in America as well...
