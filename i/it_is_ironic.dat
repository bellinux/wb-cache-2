5|$|Bart goes to {{the video}} game store and coerces the clerk to let him buy the new and violent Grand Theft Scratchy game, only to have it confiscated by Marge. While Bart mopes, a video game manual crashes {{down from the sky}} in front of him. Reading through the manual, Bart discovers that he {{and the rest of his}} family have special powers. Later, Bart uses his Bartman powers to stop Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph from {{stealing}} from the Natural History Museum, Homer uses his ability to become a huge ball and win an eating contest, Lisa uses her powers of meditation to stop a deforestation project, and Marge uses her powers to influence crowds to stop the release of Grand Theft Scratchy in Springfield, although Lisa points out <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> she used violence to stop a violent game.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic,</b> but Viktor, {{whose name}} is {{associated}} with historical and mythological paintings, initially avoided these subjects at all costs. For his graphic composition of Christ and Pontius Pilate Before the People, the Academy awarded a small silver medal to him.|$|E
25|$|Apollodorus {{recounted the}} tale in his Bibliotheca. King Eurytus {{was an expert}} archer who taught his sons his {{knowledge}} of the bow and arrow. He promised his daughter Iole to whomever could beat him and his sons in an archery contest. The sons shot so well that they beat all the others from the kingdom. Heracles then heard of the prize and eagerly entered the contest for he desired the maiden. Heracles shot with keenness and even beat Eurytus' scores. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> because Eurytus in his early years had taught Heracles to become an archer.|$|E
50|$|When the Lou Bronsan Gymnasium {{opened in}} August 1997, it boasted a gym floor that cost $1 {{million to build}} and was of {{exceptional}} quality. Many students felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> when the gymnasium leaked during the El Niño storms of winter 1998. Lime stains were visible on the gymnasium walls through 2001.|$|R
2500|$|Šejna {{was granted}} asylum in the United States, {{much to the}} dismay of Soviet {{authorities}} and became an intelligence source for American agencies and policy makers. According to Czechoslovak ambassador Duda, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> that, [...] "Šejna, who represented the worst elements of the conservative clique in Prague, should find haven in the United States".|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> that Ford {{ended up}} at Arkansas, since his {{replacement}} at Clemson was former Razorback head coach Ken Hatfield, who had had his own falling out with Arkansas athletic director Frank Broyles. Hatfield took the Clemson job in January 1990, {{less than a week}} after Ford resigned, without even visiting the campus.|$|R
25|$|Montoto {{has been}} {{described}} as having “a very ostentatious lifestyle.” He owns a BMW and a mansion in Palermo Chico, and at one point owned a private jet. He is a devout Catholic, who “is proud of his photos with Pope Benedict XVI and the right-wing Bishop Emilio Ogñenovich.” He {{has been described}} as “struggling with his weight” over the years and as maintaining a low profile while accumulating power and becoming a millionaire with “a sumptuous mansion in Barrio Parque.” Many commentators have stated that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> to see a former Montonero driving a BMW.|$|E
25|$|As the 20th century progressed, {{trade on}} the Newcastle and Gateshead quaysides {{gradually}} declined, until by the eighties {{both sides of the}} river were looking rather derelict. Shipping company offices had closed along with offices of firms related to shipping. There were also derelict warehouses lining the riverbank. A decision was taken by local government to re-develop the Newcastle quayside and this was begun in the 1990s following a master plan. New offices, restaurants, bars and residential accommodation were built and the area has changed {{in the space of a}} few years into a vibrant area. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> that this development has partially returned the focus of Newcastle to the riverside, where it was in medieval times.|$|E
25|$|Cavalry {{were rarely}} {{used by the}} Assyrians or many other Mesopotamians until the 9th century BC, when their use is {{mentioned}} {{during the reign of}} Tukulti-Ninurta II. Before then, many nomads or steppe warriors relied on cavalry, who raided Assyrian lands. The Assyrians had to counter this mobile form of warfare and so beat their opponents, notably the Iranians, at their own game. Perhaps the greatest outside influence is that of the Iranian Medes. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> that the raiding by that people assisted Assyrian attempts in building a cavalry army with which to destroy the Kingdom of Elam. However, Assyrian attempts were not without difficulties; horse archers were used but could not use their bows and the reins of their horses at the same time. As a result, cavalry under Ashurnasirpal are depicted in pairs, with one rider holding both reins and the other shooting with a bow. The Assyrians experienced fewer problems with cavalry when they were deployed as lancers; under Tiglath Pileser III, the Assyrian Cavalry continued to be paired of but this time each warrior held his own lance and controlled his own horse. By the 7th century BC, mounted Assyrian warriors were well armed with a bow and a lance, and armored with lamellar armour, while their mounts were equipped with fabric armour, providing limited yet useful protection in close combat and against missiles. Cavalry were to form the core of the later Assyrian armies.|$|E

5000|$|Edward Herrmann portrayed Eastman in {{the film}} Reds (1981), {{directed}} by and starring Warren Beatty, {{which was based on}} the life of John Reed. John Patrick Diggins, Eastman's biographer, said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> that Herrmann <b>was</b> cast as Eastman, who was an extremely handsome man, while the good-looking Beatty portrayed Reed, who had a bookish appearance.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> {{that both}} <b>were</b> famous as Shakespearean actors: in an America that {{had yet to}} {{establish}} its own theatrical traditions, the way to prove its cultural prowess was to do Shakespeare {{as well as the}} British, and even to claim that Shakespeare, had he been alive at the time, would have been, at heart at least, an American.|$|R
500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> that Rifenburg {{was born}} in Petoskey, Michigan in 1926 for several reasons. [...] Ted Petoskey preceded Rifenburg as an All-American end on the University of Michigan {{football}} team. Petoskey had excelled {{as a representative of}} Saginaw County in MHSAA competition. Petoskey posted significant football accomplishments in 1926 making 1926 a significant year for himself as well. Achieving All-American status as an end at Michigan would be Rifenburg's next step after excelling in MHSAA competition.|$|E
500|$|Another {{approach}} to critique {{taken in the}} classroom has been to propose the insignificance of female characters in the story as sexist. While Bilbo {{may be seen as}} a literary symbol of small folk of any gender, a gender-conscious approach can help students establish notions of a [...] "socially symbolic text" [...] where meaning is generated by tendentious readings of a given work. By this interpretation, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> that the first authorized adaptation was a stage production in a girls' school.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{repetition}} of this theme in the text, there is some discussion about its pervading influence. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic,</b> critic Clarence B. Lindsay posits, that while McGregor is busy organizing the marching men, he (as opposed to the narrator) all but ignores the chaos in the city he is constantly traversing. On a larger scale, {{it is difficult to}} know whether Sherwood Anderson takes seriously the nostalgic notion of Civil War soldiers marching together as an inspiration for the McGregor's [...] "aesthetic of power" [...] or whether the exaggerated traits of McGregor are, in fact, ironic representations of the benefits of order. This view is furthered by Mark Whalan who likened Anderson's [...] "imposition of order by masculine force" [...] to the [...] "masculine misogyny" [...] of the Italian Futurists many of whom, unlike Anderson (who did not actually see combat during his military service), moved away from their glorification of violence after experiencing World War I.|$|E
5000|$|Dodd died {{of cancer}} in Baton Rouge General Medical Center. Death came at 6 a.m. {{on the day of the}} Edwin Edwards-David Duke gubernatorial showdown. Had he been able to {{comprehend}} fully, Dodd would have surely known the outcome of that battle, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> that this [...] "political man" [...] would die on the day of one of the most contentious elections in Louisiana history.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{is heard}} {{playing on a}} car radio in an episode of True Blood. <b>Its</b> use <b>is</b> <b>ironic,</b> since the car's driver is Hayes, a violent vampire.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{essentially}} <b>ironic</b> or sarcastic, satire {{is often}} misunderstood. A typical misunderstanding is {{to confuse the}} satirist with his persona.|$|R
500|$|Lucius's {{apparently}} solemn {{devotion to}} the Isis cult in this chapter contrasts strongly with the comic misadventures {{that make up the}} rest of the novel. Scholars debate whether the account is intended to seriously represent Lucius's {{devotion to the}} goddess, or whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic,</b> perhaps a satire of the Isis cult. Those who believe it is satirical point to the way Lucius is pushed to undergo several initiations, each requiring a fee, despite having little money. Although many of the scholars who have tried to analyze the mysteries based on the book have assumed it is serious, the book may be broadly accurate even if it is satirical. Apuleius's description of the Isis cult and its mysteries generally fits with much of the outside evidence about them. S.J. Harrison says it shows [...] "detailed knowledge of Egyptian cult, whether or not Apuleius himself was in fact an initiate of Isiac religion." [...] In another of his works, the Apologia, Apuleius claims to have undergone several initiations, though he does not mention the mysteries of Isis specifically. In writing Metamorphoses, he may have drawn on personal experience of the Isiac initiation or of other initiations that he underwent. Even so, the detailed description given in Metamorphoses may be idealized rather than strictly accurate, and the Isis cults may have included many varieties of mystery rite. The novel actually mentions three distinct initiation rites in two cities, although only the first is described in any detail.|$|E
2500|$|Having written {{extensively}} about ID, philosopher of science Robert Pennock says [...] "When lobbying for ID in the public schools, wedge members sometimes deny that ID makes any claims about {{the identity of the}} designer. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> that their political strategy leads them to deny God in the public square more often than Peter did." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> that, {{although}} famous Lautner {{works like}} the Carling and Harpel houses, the Chemosphere and the Sheats Goldstein Residence have become inextricably linked with Los Angeles {{in the public}} imagination, Lautner repeatedly expressed his dislike of California. In his oral history interviews he was {{highly critical of the}} standard of architecture in Los Angeles, and idealised the rural Michigan environment of his youth, as he recalled in 1986: ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the recent}} oil price ‘crisis’ <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> that the UK’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, while castigating OPEC’s members {{for failing to}} produce enough oil to bring prices down, ignored the UK’s role since the early 1990 s {{as one of the}} top- 10 global oil producers. He also failed to admit that the now-declining UK oil output results from a less than pro-active {{government}} policy for the country’s hydrocarbons industry...|$|R

2500|$|She also {{incurred}} {{some criticism}} {{from some of}} the Irish Catholic hierarchy by taking communion in an Anglican (Church of Ireland) Cathedral in Dublin on 7 December 1997, although 78 percent of Irish people approved of her action in a following opinion poll. While Cardinal Desmond Connell called her action a [...] "sham" [...] and a [...] "deception", Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> that [...] "the Church was condemning an act of reconciliation and bridge-building between the denominations." ...|$|R
2500|$|George Crile III, {{author of}} the book on which the film is based, wrote that the mujahideen's victory in Afghanistan {{ultimately}} opened a power vacuum for bin Laden: [...] "By the end of 1993, in Afghanistan itself there were no roads, no schools, just a destroyed country—and the United States was washing its hands of any responsibility. It was in this vacuum that the Taliban and Osama bin Laden would emerge as the dominant players. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> that a man who had almost {{nothing to do with the}} victory over the Red Army, Osama bin Laden, would come to personify the power of the jihad." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} all that has happened, it appears {{inappropriate}} for the MEC to deny {{the request of the}} local 14th medical examiner district to defer any further action until Dr. Siebert has been afforded the opportunity through normal proceedings to both defend his findings and refute the allegations against him as due process requires. ... Imposing sanctions against a medical examiner without requiring these theories to be tested by an impartial jury jeopardizes the independent judgment of the medical examiner that our system of government has come to rely upon precisely because of its independent objective inquiry. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> that in Dr. Siebert's case the medical examiner has been denied the very protection that his presence in such judicial proceedings is meant to provide.|$|E
2500|$|Since Millikan's work formed some of {{the basis}} for modern {{particle}} physics, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> that he was rather conservative in his opinions about 20th century developments in physics, {{as in the case}} of the photon theory. Another example is that his textbook, as late as the 1927 version, unambiguously states the existence of the ether, and mentions Einstein's theory of relativity only in a noncommittal note at the end of the caption under Einstein's portrait, stating as the last in a list of accomplishments that he was [...] "author of the special theory of relativity in 1905 and of the general theory of relativity in 1914, both of which have had great success in explaining otherwise unexplained phenomena and in predicting new ones." ...|$|E
60|$|Take another {{main feature}} of the {{national}} character--the Briton <b>is</b> <b>ironic.</b> Well, the war is deepening his irony. It must, for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a monstrously <b>ironic</b> business.|$|R
5000|$|Shipton {{wrote that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> that [...] "All for the Beatles" [...] {{approached}} Beatlemania by adapting a Rolling Stones hit. [...] "Borrowing unashamedly from <b>it</b> <b>was</b> calculated to put everyone who {{heard it in}} mind of the 'British Invasion'." [...] Nilsson sang [...] "in an Americanized approximation of John Lennon," [...] but the main guitar solo was {{very similar to that}} of Keith Richards. Shipton concludes that the song is the first real example of Nilsson's preference for overdubbing, which he perfected during his career, to take-up with the close harmony of The Beatles.|$|R
2500|$|In 2005, the Swans {{came under}} {{enormous}} public scrutiny, even from AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou, for their unorthodox, [...] "boring" [...] defense-oriented tactics that included tightly controlling the tempo {{of the game}} and starving the opposition of possession (in fact, seven teams that season had their lowest possession total whilst playing against the Swans). Swans coach Paul Roos maintained that playing contested football was the style used by all recent Premiership-winning teams, and felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> that the much criticised strategy proved ultimately successful.|$|R
2500|$|Japanese {{companies}} {{are known for}} management methods such as [...] "The Toyota Way". Kaizen ( [...] , Japanese for [...] "improvement") is a Japanese philosophy that focuses on continuous improvement throughout all aspects of life. When applied to the workplace, Kaizen activities continually improve all functions of a business, from manufacturing to management and from the CEO to the assembly line workers. By improving standardized activities and processes, Kaizen aims to eliminate waste (see Lean manufacturing). Kaizen was first implemented in several Japanese businesses during the country's recovery after World War II, including Toyota, and has since spread to businesses throughout the world. Within certain value systems, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> that Japanese workers labor amongst the most hours per day, even though kaizen is supposed to improve all aspects of life.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{aircraft}} produced {{under this}} system was the S.E.1, ostensibly a refurbishment of a Blériot XII. This {{was destroyed in}} a crash before flight testing was complete, killing Ridge. In the hands of Geoffrey de Havilland the Voisin which had been donated to the Army Air Battalion by the Duke of Westminster was reborn as the B.E. 1, a neat biplane with an excellent performance which first took to the air in December 1911, and this was followed rapidly {{by a series of}} similar aircraft, ostensibly improvements of the motley collection of aircraft in the Factory's possession, which in some cases did not even retain the original engine. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> that the first visible fruits of a programme intended to bring order to chaos were the result of a subversion of the system.|$|E
2500|$|The Loebner Prize tests {{conversational}} intelligence; {{winners are}} typically chatterbot programs, or Artificial Conversational Entities (ACE)s. Early Loebner Prize rules restricted conversations: Each entry and hidden-human conversed {{on a single}} topic, thus the interrogators were restricted to one line of questioning per entity interaction. The restricted conversation rule was lifted for the 1995 Loebner Prize. Interaction duration between judge and entity has varied in Loebner Prizes. In Loebner 2003, at the University of Surrey, each interrogator was allowed five minutes to interact with an entity, machine or hidden-human. Between 2004 and 2007, the interaction time allowed in Loebner Prizes was more than twenty minutes. In 2008, the interrogation duration allowed was five minutes per pair, because the organiser, Kevin Warwick, and coordinator, Huma Shah, consider {{this to be the}} duration for any test, as Turing stated in his 1950 paper: [...] " ... making the right identification after five minutes of questioning". They felt Loebner's longer test, implemented in Loebner Prizes 2006 and 2007, was inappropriate for the state of artificial conversation technology. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> that the 2008 winning entry, Elbot from Artificial Solutions, does not mimic a human; its personality is that of a robot, yet Elbot deceived three human judges that it was the human during human-parallel comparisons.|$|E
500|$|... "Everybody" [...] was commercially {{released}} as Madonna's first single in October 6, 1982, and {{came with a}} Lou Beach-designed sleeve depicting a hip hop–style NYC street scene. Because of the ambiguous nature of the record sleeve and the R groove of the song, Madonna was widely {{believed to be a}} black artist when the single was released. According to Matthew Lindsay of The Quietus, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> that the record sleeve did not depict Madonna on the cover, as she would become [...] "the face of the 80s." ...|$|R
50|$|While in drydock, an {{additional}} 2 in of steel {{was added to}} the main deck over the magazines. This reflected the lessons from the sinking of Hood {{as well as of the}} effectiveness of dive bombers at the Battle of Midway. Four 6-inch (152 mm) guns were replaced by two more four-barrelled anti-aircraft pompoms, reflecting the awareness of the greater risk posed by aircraft than by torpedo armed destroyers. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> that Ramillies faced such a surface attack later in the war. Fortunately the remaining 6-inch (152 mm) guns were sufficient to handle it.|$|R
