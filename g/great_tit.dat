25|$|Mobbing {{calls are}} signals {{made by the}} mobbing species while harassing a predator. These differ from alarm calls, which allow con-specifics {{to escape from the}} predator. The <b>great</b> <b>tit,</b> a European songbird, uses such a signal to call on nearby birds to harass a perched bird of prey, such as an owl. This call occurs in the 4.5kHz range, and carries over long distances. However, when prey species are in flight, they employ an alarm signal in the 7–8kHz range. This call is less {{effective}} at traveling great distances, but is much more difficult for both owls and hawks to hear (and detect the direction from which the call came). In the case of the alarm call, it could be disadvantageous to the sender if the predator picks up on the signal, hence selection has favored those birds able to hear and employ calls in this higher frequency range.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{example of}} {{evolution}} {{in response to}} illegitimate receivers {{is that of the}} <b>Great</b> <b>tits.</b> These European songbirds have evolved to use [...] "seet" [...] calls in order to avoid having their signals illegitimately received by hawks or owls. <b>Great</b> <b>tits</b> use two different calls to warn one another of nearby predators: When the predators are flying nearby, the <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> use a [...] "seet" [...] alarm call; however, when the predators are perched nearby, the <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> use a mobbing call. The mobbing call is at a much higher frequency than the seet call, allowing for the <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> to recruit nearby individuals of their species when mobbing perched predators in an attempt to chase them out of the area. Meanwhile, the lower frequency of the seet call allows the <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> to warn one another of the danger without attracting the unwanted attention of the mobile hawk or owl. Louder calls are also more frequently exhibited in birds inhabiting more protected habitats, while softer seet calls are more common in unprotected, open areas.|$|R
40|$|Ageing and {{the effects}} of {{increased}} workload in <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> A new measurement to quantify variation in quality and rate of ageing between individuals is telomere length. Telomeres are a piece of DNA at the end of chromosomes, and they protect the other DNA. In many species shortening of telomere length with increasing age was demonstrated. This shortening is accelerated by processes that also decrease life expectancy. In this project we discovered that telomeres of <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> differ from telomeres in humans and other bird species. They seem to have two classes of telomeres: long telomeres that do not shorten with increasing age and shorter telomeres that do shorten with age. So <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> have a group of ultra-long telomeres that behave differently, but why remains a mystery. In <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> we used the shorter telomeres as measurement for ageing. We found that <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> that are most successful in reproduction also better maintained their telomeres. This suggests that these successful <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> are of better quality. This effect was not observed yet, and more research into the causes could give fundamental insights about ageing. In a number of male <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> we increased the workload, because we equipped them with a backpack with the size of a transmitter. We found no long term effects of the backpacks on telomere shortening or fitness parameters, but there were some short term effects which suggested small behavioural changes. More often birds receive equipment such as transmitters, and with our results we show that these could be used without negative consequences on the long term in <b>great</b> <b>tits...</b>|$|R

500|$|Specific types: alarm; contact; duet; antiphonal duetting; food begging; flight; mobbing. A type of bird vocalization {{tending to}} serve such {{functions}} as giving alarm or keeping {{members of a}} flock in contact—as opposed to a bird's , which is longer and more complex and is usually associated with courtship and mating. Individual birds may be sensitive enough to identify each other through their calls. Many birds that nest in colonies can locate their chicks using their calls. Alarm calls are used to sound alarm to other individuals. Food-begging calls are made by baby birds to beg for food, such as the [...] "wah" [...] of infant blue jays. Mobbing calls signal other individuals in mobbing species while harassing a predator. They differ from alarm calls, which alert other species members to allow escape from predators. As an example, the <b>great</b> <b>tit,</b> a European songbird, uses such a signal to call on nearby birds to harass a perched bird of prey, such as an owl. This call occurs in the 4.5kHz range, and carries over long distances. However, when such prey species are in flight, they employ an alarm signal in the 7–8kHz range. This call is less effective at traveling great distances, but {{is much more difficult}} for both owls and hawks to hear (and detect the direction from which the call came). Contact calls are used by birds for the purpose of letting others of their species know their location. Relatedly, flight calls are vocalizations made by birds while flying, which often serve to keep flocks together. These calls are also used for when birds want to alert others that they are taking flight. Many birds engage in duet calls—a call made by two birds at or nearly at the same time. In some cases, the duets are so perfectly timed as to appear almost as one call. This kind of calling is termed antiphonal duetting. Such duetting is noted {{in a wide range of}} families including quails, bushshrikes, babblers such as [...] scimitar babblers and some owls and parrots.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the available frequency range is partitioned, and birds call so that overlap between different species in frequency and time is reduced. This idea has been termed the [...] "acoustic niche". Birds sing louder and at a higher pitch in urban areas, where there is ambient low-frequency noise. Traffic noise was found to decrease reproductive success in the <b>great</b> <b>tit</b> (Parsus major) due to the overlap in acoustic frequency. An increase in song volume restored fitness to birds in urban areas, as did higher frequency songs.|$|E

40|$|Resource {{partitioning}} is {{a central}} issue in ecology because it can establish to which point similar species can coexist in the same habitat. <b>Great</b> <b>tits</b> and blue tits have been classical model species in studies of trophic competence. However, most studies on the topic have been conducted at localities where caterpillars {{are by far the}} most relevant prey brought to the nestlings. In Mediterranean mixed forests, nevertheless, the abundance of caterpillars is relatively low and it is spiders that {{play a key role in}} the diet of <b>great</b> <b>tits,</b> at least for nestlings. The aim of this paper was to study nest food provisioning to establish the degree of diet overlap of these two tit species in a Mediterranean forest. Our results showed that blue tit feeding rates were higher than those of <b>great</b> <b>tits,</b> probably to compensate for the smaller prey delivered to nestlings by blue tits. Blue tits brought more spiders than <b>great</b> <b>tits,</b> while grey tits brought larger prey and more caterpillars. This may be because larger <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> can prey upon larger prey items than blue tits.

50|$|<b>Great</b> <b>tits</b> are {{a species}} of bird found {{throughout}} Europe, northern Africa, and Asia. They are known to forage in “patchy” environments, and {{research has shown that}} their behavior can be modeled by optimal foraging models, including the MVT. In a 1977 study by R.A. Cowie, birds were deprived of food and then allowed to forage through patches in two different environments (the environments differed only in distance between patches). As predicted, in both cases birds spent more time in one area when the patches were farther away or yielded more benefits, regardless of the environment. In a similar experiment by Naef-Danenzer (1999), <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> were shown to have a foraging efficiency 30% better than random foraging would yield. This is because <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> were specifically spending more time in resource-rich areas, as predicted by the MVT.

50|$|<b>Great</b> <b>tits</b> combine dietary {{versatility}} with {{a considerable}} amount of intelligence and the ability to solve problems with insight learning, that is to solve a problem through insight rather than trial and error. In England, <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> learned to break the foil caps of milk bottles delivered at the doorstep of homes to obtain the cream at the top. This behaviour, first noted in 1921, spread rapidly in the next two decades. In 2009, <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> were reported killing, and eating the brains of roosting pipistrelle bats. This is the first time a songbird has been recorded preying on bats. The tits only do this during winter when the bats are hibernating and other food is scarce. They have also been recorded using tools, using a conifer needle in the bill to extract larvae from a hole in a tree. In 2013, some individual <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> were noted to attack, kill and to some extent eat other small birds at wintertime feeding spots in Finland.|$|R

40|$|Compared to {{coniferous}} forests, deciduous woodlands {{have often}} been considered a more suitable habitat for Blue and <b>Great</b> <b>Tits.</b> We compared reproductive parameters of both species in oak woodland and pine plantation patches within a Mediterranean landscape.

5000|$|Work by Gorissen, Gorissen, and Eens (2006) {{has focused}} on blue tit song {{matching}} (or, [...] "song imitation") by <b>great</b> <b>tits.</b> Blue and <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> compete for resources such as food and nesting cavities and their coexistence has important fitness consequences for both species. These fitness costs might promote interspecific aggression because resources need to be defended against heterospecifics as well. So, the use of efficient vocal strategies such as matching might prove {{to be effective in}} interspecific communication. Hence, heterospecific matching could be a way of phrasing a threat {{in the language of the}} heterospecfic intruder. It could equally be well argued that these imitations of blue tit sounds have no function at all and are merely the result of learning mistakes in the sensitive period of <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> because blue and <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> form mixed foraging flocks together. While the authors agree with the first hypothesis, it is plausible that the latter also being true given the data on age and experience in primates.|$|R

40|$|Winter {{acclimatization}} {{in birds}} {{is a complex}} of several strategies based on metabolic adjustment accompanied by long-term management of resources such as fattening. However, wintering birds often maintain fat reserves below their physiological capacity, suggesting a cost involved with excessive levels of reserves. We studied body reserves of roosting <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> {{in relation to their}} dominance status under two contrasting temperature regimes to see whether individuals are capable of optimizing their survival strategies under extreme environmental conditions. We predicted less pronounced loss of body mass and body condition and lower rates of overnight mortality in dominant <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> at both mild and extremely low ambient temperatures, when ambient temperature dropped down to − 43 °C. The results showed that dominant <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> consistently maintained lower reserve levels than subordinates regardless of ambient temperature. However, dominants responded to the rising risk of starvation under low temperatures by increasing their body reserves, whereas subdominant birds decreased reserve levels in harsh conditions. Yet, their losses of body mass and body reserves were always lower than in subordinate birds. None of the dominant <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> were found dead, while five young females and one adult female were found dead in nest boxes during cold spells when ambient temperatures dropped down to − 43 °C. The dead <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> lost up to 23. 83 % of their evening body mass during cold nights while surviving individuals lost on average 12. 78 % of their evening body mass.

50|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} is {{a predator}} of <b>great</b> <b>tits,</b> {{with the young}} from second broods being at higher risk {{partly because of the}} hawk's greater need for food for its own developing young. The nests of <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> are raided by great spotted woodpeckers, particularly when nesting in certain types of nest boxes. Other nest predators include introduced grey squirrels (in Britain) and least weasels, which are able to take nesting adults as well. A species of biting louse (Mallophaga) described as Rostrinirmus hudeci was isolated and described in 1981 from <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> in central Europe. The hen flea Ceratophyllus gallinae is exceedingly common in the nests of blue and <b>great</b> <b>tits.</b> It was originally a specialist tit flea, but the dry, crowded conditions of chicken runs enabled it to flourish with its new host. This flea is preferentially predated by the clown beetle Gnathoncus punctulatus, The rove beetle Microglotta pulla also feeds on fleas and their larvae.

50|$|<b>Great</b> <b>tits</b> are {{primarily}} insectivorous in the summer, feeding on insects and spiders which they capture by foliage gleaning. Invertebrate prey that are taken include cockroaches, grasshoppers and crickets, lacewings, earwigs, bugs (Hemiptera), ants, flies (Diptera), caddis flies, beetles, scorpion flies, harvestmen, bees and wasps, snails and woodlice. During the breeding season, the tits prefer to feed protein-rich caterpillars to their young. A {{study published in}} 2007 found that <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> helped to reduce caterpillar damage in apple orchards {{by as much as}} 50%. Nestlings also undergo a period in their early development where they are fed a number of spiders, possibly for nutritional reasons. In autumn and winter, when insect prey becomes scarcer, <b>great</b> <b>tits</b> add berries and seeds to their diet. Seeds and fruit usually come from deciduous trees and shrubs, and include the seeds of beech and hazel. Where it is available they will readily take table scraps, peanuts and sunflower seeds from bird tables. In particularly severe winters they may consume 44% of their body weight in sunflower seeds. They often forage on the ground, particularly in years with high beech mast production. <b>Great</b> <b>tits,</b> along with other tits, will join winter mixed-species foraging flocks.|$|R
