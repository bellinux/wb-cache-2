40|$|Health and Usage Monitoring Systems are {{receiving}} {{a great deal}} of interest, in an attempt to increase the safety and operational readiness of helicopters, and to minimize maintenance costs. These systems monitor (and can record) various flight parameters, pilot conversations, engine exhaust debris, metallic chip detector levels in the lubrication system, rotor track and balance, as well as vibration levels at selected locations throughout the airframe and the power drive system. Vibration levels are currently being observed on two operational SH- 60 B helicopters and on an H- 60 power drive system <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Helicopter</b> Transmission Test Facility (HTTF) at the Naval Air Warfare Center, Trenton, NJ. This paper employs classification trees to analyse vibration signatures produced in the HTTF, identifying those characteristics which distinguish normal signatures from signatures produced by known faulted parts. These trees are quite successful in separating the two types of signatures and achieve small misclassification rates for HTTF data. They are also applied to vibration data collected from an operational aircraft; assuming the tail gearbox in the operational aircraft has no faults, the trees derived from the HTTF produce a high proportion of false alarmsNaval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA[URL] Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA...|$|E

40|$|Hazardous weather {{conditions}} significantly limit the operational capability of civil helicopters. This limitation {{arises from the}} crew's inability to determine the location of obstacles in the environment by sight. In order to assist the crew in these circumstances a range of equipment and sensors may be <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopter.</b> However, with multiple sensors on board, the problem of efficiently assimilating {{the large amount of}} imagery and data available generates a significant workload. A reduction of the workload may be achieved by the automation of this assimilation (sensor fusion) and the design of a system to guide the pilot along obstacle free paths. In order to provide the guidance to avoid obstacles a system must have knowledge about the obstacles' possible positions and likely future positions relative the system's own aircraft. Since the information being provided by the sensors will not be perfect, (i. e. it will have some uncertainty associated with it), and since the process model, which must be used to predict any future positions, will also be uncertain, the required positions must be estimated. As the dynamics of moving obstacles will be a priori unknown, {{it will be necessary to}} learn process models for them. The dynamics of the obstacles cannot be guaranteed to be linear, therefore these process models must be capable of reflecting this non-linear behaviour. The uncertain information produced by the various sensors will be related to required knowledge about the obstacles by a sensor model, however this relationship need not be linear, and may even have to be learned. Currently used estimation techniques (e. g. the ordinary extended Kalman filter) are inadequate for estimating the uncertainty involved in the obstacles' positions for the highly non-linear processes under consideration. Neural network approaches to non-linear estimation have recently allowed process and sensor models to be learned (sometimes implicitly), however these approaches have been quite ad hoc in their implementation and have been even more negligent in the estimation of uncertainty. The main contributions of this research are the design of non-linear estimators which may use process and sensor models that result from learning processes, and the use of the output of these estimators to determine guidance for obstacle free paths through the environment in 3 dimensions...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} compute the weight and balance of a {{helicopter}} in flight under general conditions is an enabling technology for future condition based maintenance systems as well as advanced automatic flight control systems. This paper creates a real-time weight and balance estimation algorithm using an extended Kalman filter framework. To highlight estimation characteristics, the algorithm is exercised on the OH- 6 A helicopter {{in a variety of}} flight regimes. The algorithm is shown to work well in hover and forward flight as well as situations where loads are dropped and picked up <b>in</b> flight. Typically <b>the</b> algorithm quickly estimates station line and butt line mass center position (1 sec) and more slowly converges on helicopter weight (10 sec). To estimate <b>helicopter</b> waterline, <b>the</b> algorithm requires maneuvering flight where non zero roll rate is present. The algorithm is also shown to be reasonably robust to sensor and model errors.
