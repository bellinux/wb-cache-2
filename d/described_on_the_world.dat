40|$|Preliminary and incomplete: Please do not quote without {{permission}} of the author*** The “link economy ” is commonly used to <b>describe</b> activity <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Wide Web (WWW) and refers {{to the value of}} linking to (and being linked to by) other websites. The distribution of links <b>on</b> <b>the</b> WWW clearly has real economic effects; commercial sites with higher indegrees will be more visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Web, and thus visited more frequently, because they will be ranked more highly by Google, for example. However, there has been a surprising lack of economic analysis of linking activity <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Web, with the majority of quantitative analysis using approaches from applied physics. Applied physics has provided the influential characterisation of the WWW as being scale-free, with a small number of sites receiving the lion’s share of links. This has been explained using the concept of “preferential attachment” whereby new sites joining the network prefer to link to sites that already have high in-degree, thus leading to the “rich get richer ” phenomenon. However...|$|R

25|$|The documentary's {{purpose is}} {{to educate the public}} to gain an {{understanding}} of autism. Taylor Cross interviews autistic {{children between the ages of}} 9 to 19, and asks them to <b>describe</b> their perspective <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and to share their thoughts. The youngest autistic child to appear in the film is a boy named Ricky, and the oldest at age 19 shares the same name as the co-director, Taylor. An autistic boy named Brian appears in the film and voices frustration due to experiencing teasing from girls at his school. Brian's sister Elizabeth also appears in the film – she communicates with her brother in a language only the two of them comprehend. Cross also interviews parents of children with autism, including surfer Izzy Paskowitz. In addition, Cross interviews the dean of the film program at New York University.|$|R

[...] In {{a speech}} at Cannes about L'Avventura, Antonioni said that in the modern age of reason and science, mankind still lives by [...] "a rigid and stereotyped morality which all of us recognize as such and yet sustain out of cowardice and sheer laziness". He said his films explore the paradox that [...] "we have examined those moral attitudes very carefully, we have dissected them and analyzed them to the point of exhaustion. We have been capable of all this, but we have not been capable of finding new ones." [...] Nine years later he expressed a similar attitude in an interview, saying that he loathed the word 'morality': [...] "When man becomes reconciled to nature, when space becomes his true background, these words and concepts will have lost their meaning, and we will no longer have to use them." ...|$|R
