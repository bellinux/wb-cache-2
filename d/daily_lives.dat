5|$|Daoism and Buddhism {{were the}} {{dominant}} religions of China in the Song era, the latter deeply impacting many beliefs {{and principles of}} Neo-Confucianism throughout the dynasty. Ironically, Buddhism came under heavy criticism by staunch Confucian advocates and philosophers of the time. Older beliefs in ancient Chinese mythology, folk religion, and ancestor worship also played a large part in people's <b>daily</b> <b>lives,</b> as the Chinese believed that deities and ghosts of the spiritual realm frequently interacted with the living realm.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the applicability of}} the Bayer - Activities of <b>Daily</b> <b>Living</b> scale and its efficiency in differentiating individuals with mild to moderate dementia from normal elderly controls. METHOD: We selected 33 patients with diagnosis of mild to severe dementia, according to ICD- 10 criteria, and 59 controls. All the subjects were evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale and the Bayer - Activities of <b>Daily</b> <b>Living</b> scale was applied to informants. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the Bayer - Activities of <b>Daily</b> <b>Living</b> was high (Cronbach's alpha = 0. 981). Mean Mini-Mental State Examination and Bayer - Activities of <b>Daily</b> <b>Living</b> scores of demented patients and controls were significantly different (p < 0. 001). Mean Mini-Mental State Examination and Bayer - Activities of <b>Daily</b> <b>Living</b> scores were significantly different between Clinical Dementia Rating Scale 0 (controls; n = 59) versus Clinical Dementia Rating Scale 1 (mild dementia; n = 15), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale 0 versus Clinical Dementia Rating Scale 2 (moderate dementia; n = 13), and for Clinical Dementia Rating Scale 1 versus Clinical Dementia Rating Scale 2 (p < 0. 003). DISCUSSION: The Bayer - Activities of <b>Daily</b> <b>Living</b> scale and Mini-Mental State Examination differentiated elderly controls from patients with mild or moderate dementia, and patients with mild dementia from those with moderate dementia. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the Bayer - Activities of <b>Daily</b> <b>Living</b> scale applied to an informant can help in the diagnosis and follow-up of Brazilian patients with mild to moderate dementia...|$|R

It is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland system and evidence from Bornais suggests that settlers there may have been more prosperous than families of a similar status in the Northern Isles, possibly owing to a more relaxed political regime.

5|$|The word lesbian {{is derived}} from the name of the Greek island of Lesbos, home to the 6th-century BCE poet Sappho. From various ancient writings, historians {{gathered}} that a group of young women were left in Sappho's charge for their instruction or cultural edification. Little of Sappho's poetry survives, but her remaining poetry reflects the topics she wrote about: women's <b>daily</b> <b>lives,</b> their relationships, and rituals. She focused on the beauty of women and proclaimed her love for girls. Before the mid-19th century, the word lesbian referred to any derivative or aspect of Lesbos, including a type of wine.|$|E

However, Gaius and the spirit named Muzét seal Maxwell within the Lance of Kresnik, intent on sustaining the barrier until all spyrixs are destroyed; Maxwell sends {{the party to}} Elympios before he is completely subdued. There, the party learns about Elympios' dependence on spyrix and an ongoing research on spyrite, a power source harmless to spirits. With renewed conviction, the party confronts and defeats Gaius and Muzét. Maxwell dispels the barrier and disperses its energy to temporarily power spyrixes until the completion of spyrites. The party returns to their <b>daily</b> <b>lives</b> with Jude joining a spyrite research team, Milla resuming her role as Maxwell, and Gaius uniting Rieze Maxia under his rule.|$|E
5|$|Historian Nancy Rabinowitz {{argues that}} ancient Greek red vase images portraying women {{with their arms}} around another woman's waist, or leaning on a woman's {{shoulders}} can be construed as expressions of romantic desire. Much of the <b>daily</b> <b>lives</b> of women in ancient Greece is unknown, specifically their expressions of sexuality. Although men participated in pederastic relationships outside marriage, {{there is no clear}} evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same-sex relationships before or during marriage as long as their marital obligations were met. Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection, and in instances where women appear only with other women, their images are eroticized: bathing, touching one another, with dildos placed in and around such scenes, and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of heterosexual marriage or pederastic seduction. Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown.|$|E

5|$|In 1916, {{before his}} father imposed {{a ban on}} {{competitive}} cricket, Constantine had played briefly for Shannon Cricket Club; {{he returned to the}} club in 1920. Initially, he appeared in the second team, but after scoring 50 runs in an hour during his third game, was promoted to the first eleven. Cricket in Trinidad at the time was divided along racial lines; Shannon was mainly for black lower middle-class players such as teachers or clerks. The club was competitive and highly motivated, partly as a reaction to the racial discrimination that its players and supporters encountered in their <b>daily</b> <b>lives.</b> Constantine's cricket thrived in this atmosphere, and the club helped to form some of his political views. He particularly noticed that in Trinidadian and West Indian cricket, white and light-skinned players were often favoured over black players of greater ability.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth season}} of the American {{television}} comedy The Office premiered in the United States on NBC on September 27, 2007, and concluded on May 15, 2008.

5|$|There {{is a small}} Japanese {{community}} in Palau, which mainly consists of Japanese expatriates residing in Palau over a long-term basis. A few Japanese expatriates started to reside in Palau after it gained independence in 1994, and established long-term businesses in the country. Japanese settlement in Palau {{dates back to the}} early 19th century, although large scale Japanese migration to Palau did not occur until the 1920s, when Palau came under Japanese rule and administered as part of the South Pacific Mandate. Japanese settlers took on leading administrative roles in the Japanese colonial government, and developed Palau's economy. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, virtually all of the Japanese population was repatriated back to Japan, although people of mixed Japanese-Palauan descent were allowed to remain behind.

5|$|Canada is religiously diverse, {{encompassing}} a {{wide range}} of beliefs and customs. Canada has no official church, and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism. Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. The practice of religion is now generally considered a private matter throughout society and the state. With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life, Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state. The majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their <b>daily</b> <b>lives,</b> but still believe in God. According to the 2011 census, 67.3% of Canadians identify as Christian; of these, Roman Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 38.7% of the population. Much of the remainder is made up of Protestants, who accounted for approximately 27% in a 2011 survey. The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada (accounting for 6.1% of Canadians), followed by Anglicans (5.0%), and Baptists (1.9%). Secularization has been growing since the 1960s. In 2011, 23.9% declared no religious affiliation, compared to 16.5% in 2001. The remaining 8.8% are affiliated with non-Christian religions, the largest of which are Islam (3.2%) and Hinduism (1.5%).|$|E
