5|$|External parasites of {{the garden}} warbler include the fleas Ceratophyllus gallinae and Dasypsyllus gallinulae and the mite Syringophilosis borini, named after its host. Two species of {{protozoan}} parasites in the genus Isospora occur in garden warblers, I. sylvianthina and I. sylviae. Samples from two sites showed infection levels above 74% and 28% respectively for the two species. The extent of infection does not impact on the bird's body mass or the amount of body fat. Three strains of another protozoan, Haemoproteus parabelopolskyi are <b>found</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the garden warbler, and form a monophyletic group. Seventeen further members of that group are <b>found</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the blackcap, and another three occur in the African hill babbler, supporting the shared ancestry of the three bird species.|$|E
