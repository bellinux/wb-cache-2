50|$|In {{the event}} of {{excessive}} loads on the Boeing 747 engines or engine pylons, the fuse pins holding the engine nacelle to the wing are designed to fracture cleanly, allowing the engine to fall away from the aircraft without damaging the wing or wing fuel tank. Airliners are generally designed to remain airworthy in {{the event of}} an engine failure, so that they can be landed safely. Damage to a wing or wing fuel tank can have disastrous consequences. The Netherlands Aviation Safety Board found, however, that the fuse pins had not failed properly, but instead had suffered metal fatigue prior to overload failure. The Safety Board pieced together a probable sequence of events for the loss of engine three:#Gradual failure by fatigue and then overload failure of the inboard mid-spar <b>fuse</b> <b>pin</b> at the inboard thin-walled location.#Overload failure of the outer lug of the inboard mid-spar pylon fitting.#Overload failure of the outboard mid-spar <b>fuse</b> <b>pin</b> at the outboard thin-walled and fatigue-cracked location.#Overload failure of the outboard mid-spar <b>fuse</b> <b>pin</b> at the inboard thin-walled location.|$|E
5000|$|The {{accident}} was attributed by the JTSB {{to a series}} of porpoising oscillations that developed during touchdown, following a high sink rate during the final approach. The first officer executed a late flare, in which sink rate was not suppressed until the plane was nearly on the runway, but which also would minimize [...] "float" [...] that might carry the plane further down the runway and reduce its safe stopping distance, or carry it off the centerline in the existing crosswinds. This high touchdown sink rate, coupled with large nose-up inputs, caused the first bounce. A large nose-down input was applied, causing a touchdown on the nose gear. This deviates from approved procedures for the MD-11 during a bounce, which specifies the pilot is to hold a pitch angle of 7.5 deg and use thrust to adjust the descent rate. The plane bounced off this second touchdown, pitching upward. The large control inputs by the first officer resulted in a hard touchdown on the main landing gear. This final touchdown was hard enough (1200 fpm) to cause the left wing to fail as the left main landing gear transferred force up into the wing, exceeding its design limit. The JTSB report suggested the fire might have been averted if the landing gear <b>fuse</b> <b>pin</b> had failed as designed, but that much of the touchdown force was horizontal to the pin rather than vertical, keeping it intact. The report also cited the crew's use of autothrottle during landing despite gusty wind conditions.|$|E
50|$|After {{the crash}} investigation, Boeing issued a service {{directive}} to all airlines regarding the faulty <b>fuse</b> <b>pins</b> on Boeing 747 aircraft. Engines {{had to be}} removed from 747s and the pylons examined for cracks in the <b>fuse</b> <b>pins.</b> If cracks were present, the <b>fuse</b> <b>pins</b> were to be replaced.|$|R
50|$|The {{physical}} {{design is}} also used by SAE J560 with basically the same configuration. The difference is that SAE J560 uses 12V (larger wire cross-section and higher amp rating on <b>fuses).</b> <b>Pin</b> 7 may also have a different behavior on SAE J560.|$|R
500|$|Accidents due {{to design}} {{deficiencies}} included TWA Flight 800, where a 747-100 exploded in mid-air on July 17, 1996, {{probably due to}} sparking electricity wires inside the fuel tank; this finding led the FAA to propose a rule requiring installation of an inerting system in the center fuel tank of most large aircraft that was adopted in July 2008, after years of research into solutions. [...] At the time, the new safety system was expected to cost US$100,000 to $450,000 per aircraft and weigh approximately [...] El Al Flight 1862 crashed after the <b>fuse</b> <b>pins</b> for an engine broke off shortly after take-off due to metal fatigue. Instead of dropping away from the wing, the engine knocked off the adjacent engine and damaged the wing.|$|R
50|$|Boeing was in {{the midst}} of {{designing}} the Boeing B-47 Stratojet, and the initial Model 424 was a straight-wing design similar to the B-45, B-46 and B-48 it competed with. A recent design overhaul completed in June produced the Model 432, another four-engine design with the engines buried in the fuselage to reduce drag, and long-span wings that gave it an almost glider-like appearance. By September the Braunschweig data had been worked into the design, which re-emerged as the Model 448, a larger six-engine design with more robust wings swept at about 35 degrees. Another re-work in November moved the engines into strut-mounted pods under the wings since Boeing was concerned that the uncontained failure of an internal engine could potentially destroy the aircraft. With the engines mounted away from the wings on struts equipped with <b>fuse</b> <b>pins,</b> an out-of-balance engine would simply shatter the pins and fall harmlessly away, sparing the aircraft from destructive vibrations. The resulting B-47 design had performance rivaling the fastest fighters and trounced the straight-winged competition. Boeing's winning jet-transport formula of swept wings and engines mounted on pylons under the wings has since been universally adopted.|$|R
50|$|Flight 1862 was {{scheduled}} to depart at 5:30 pm, but was delayed until 6:20 pm. It departed from runway 01L (today known as runway 36C) on a northerly heading at 6:22 pm. Once airborne, the aircraft turned to the right on its departure route. Soon after the turn, at 6:27 pm, above the Gooimeer, a lake near Amsterdam, witnesses on the ground heard a sharp bang while the aircraft was climbing through 1950 meters (6500 feet). The bang {{was the result of}} the two <b>fuse</b> <b>pins</b> attaching engine three to the right wing failing due to microscopic fatigue cracks. The engine separated from the right wing of the aircraft, shot forward, damaged the wing flaps, then fell back and struck engine number four, tearing it from the wing. The two engines fell away from the aircraft, also ripping out a 9-meter (30-foot) stretch of the wing's leading edge. The loud noise attracted the attention of some pleasure boaters on Gooimeer. The boaters notified the Netherlands Coastguard of two objects they had seen falling from the sky. One boater, a police officer, said he initially thought the two falling objects were parachutists, but as they fell closer he could see they were both plane engines.|$|R

50|$|Fuse {{packages}} {{may include}} a rejection feature {{such as a}} pin, slot, or tab, which prevents interchange of otherwise similar appearing fuses.

40|$|The {{steady state}} level of {{integral}} membrane proteins {{is dependent on}} a strictly controlled delivery and removal. Here we show that Dendra 2, a green-to-red photoconvertible fluorescent protein, is a suitable tool to study protein turnover in plants. We characterized the fluorescence properties of Dendra 2 expressed either as a free protein or as a tag in Arabidopsis thaliana roots and optimized photoconversion settings to study protein turnover. Dendra 2 was <b>fused</b> to the <b>PIN</b> 2 protein, an auxin transporter in the root tip, and by time-lapse imaging and assessment of red and green signal intensities in the membrane after photoconversion we quantified directly and simultaneously the rate of PIN 2 delivery of the newly synthesized protein into the plasma membrane {{as well as the}} disappearance of the protein from the plasma membrane due to degradation. Additionally we have verified several factors which are expected to affect PIN 2 protein turnover an...|$|R
40|$|Sollbruchstelle: this German {{engineering}} term translates literally as “part that {{is supposed}} to break down. ” It stands for that part of a machine, such as a <b>fuse</b> or shear <b>pin,</b> that is deliberately designed to be weaker, and less costly, than the other parts of the machine so that it, rather than the more expensive parts, breaks down when the machine comes under stress. A breakdown thus comes with little collateral damage and is fixed quickly and at low cost. This paper applies the idea of Sollbruchstelle to the design of fiat monetary institutions. Well-designed institutions are credibly committed to follow a sound monetary policy. But they are also flexible in the face of deep uncertainty. They respond to novel economic and social developments as well as shifting understandings of the way the macroeconomy works. They accommodate political pressures, renege on promises, and change their institutional stripes. When they become obsolete, they go gently into that good night—and if they must break down, they do so forgivingly. Mass democracy, in its institutionally mature variant, is uniquely well-suited to support the complex fiat institutions that implement a favorable credibility-flexibility tradeoff in monetary policy. 2...|$|R
2500|$|Early tubes used a {{metal or}} glass {{envelope}} atop an insulating bakelite base. In 1938 a technique {{was developed to}} use an all-glass construction with the <b>pins</b> <b>fused</b> in the glass base of the envelope. This {{was used in the}} design of a much smaller tube outline, known as the miniature tube, having 7 or 9 pins. Making tubes smaller reduced the voltage where they could safely operate, and also reduced the power dissipation of the filament. Miniature tubes became predominant in consumer applications such as radio receivers and hi-fi amplifiers. However the larger older styles continued to be used especially as higher power rectifiers, in higher power audio output stages and as transmitting tubes.Subminiature tubes with a size roughly that of half a cigarette were used in hearing-aid amplifiers. These tubes did not have pins plugging into a socket but were soldered in place. The [...] "acorn tube" [...] (named due to its shape) was also very small, as was the metal-cased RCA nuvistor from 1959, {{about the size of a}} thimble. The nuvistor was developed to compete with the early transistors and operated at higher frequencies than those early transistors could. The small size supported especially high-frequency operation; nuvistors were used in UHF television tuners and some HiFi FM radio tuners (Sansui 500A) until replaced by high-frequency capable transistors.|$|R
