25|$|The {{revenues}} from taxes were disappointing; for example, {{revenues from}} the tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year. They did not amount to more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year and the average was closer to 50 million. In addition, as taxable trading volumes fell, so did revenues from capital <b>gains</b> <b>taxes,</b> entirely offsetting {{revenues from the}} equity transactions tax that had grown to 4,000 million Swedish kronor by 1988.|$|E

Following his escape there were reported sightings in Latin America, Spain and Africa, as well as formal investigations aimed at bringing him to justice, some of which took place even after he had apparently died in Egypt. The German government offered €150,000 for information leading to his arrest, while the Simon Wiesenthal Center launched Operation Last Chance, a project to assist governments in the location and arrest of suspected Nazi war criminals who are still alive.

500|$|Despite these achievements, Jack grew {{weary of}} making films, and he sold a {{substantial}} amount of his studio stock to Seven Arts Productions on November 14, 1966. [...] Some observers believed that Ben Kalmenson, Warner Bros.'s executive vice president, persuaded Warner to sell his stock so that Kalmenson could assume leadership of the studio. [...] Warner, however, had personal reasons for seeking retirement. [...] His wife, Ann, continually pressured him to [...] "slow down", and the aging studio head felt a need to put his affairs in order. [...] Warner sold his 1.6million shares of studio stock shortly after producing the film adaptation of Lerner & Loewe's Camelot.

The Fair Tax Act (/) would apply a tax, once, {{at the point of}} purchase on all new goods and services for personal consumption. The proposal also calls for a monthly payment to all family households of lawful U.S. residents as an advance rebate, or [...] "prebate", of tax on purchases up to the poverty level. [...] First introduced into the United States Congress in 1999, a number of congressional committees have heard testimony on the bill; however, it has not moved from committee and has yet to have any effect on the tax system. [...] In recent years, a tax reform movement has formed behind the FairTax proposal.

Johnson spoke at the 2016 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), a forum for conservative politicians. [...] He has identified as a classical liberal. He would repeal Obamacare. Johnson has said he favors simplifying and reducing taxes. During his governorship, Johnson cut taxes fourteen times and never increased them. Due to his stance on taxes, political pundit David Weigel described him as [...] "the original Tea Party candidate." [...] Johnson has advocated the FairTax as a template for tax reform. This proposal would abolish all federal income, corporate and capital <b>gains</b> <b>taxes,</b> and replace them with a 23% tax on consumption of all non-essential goods, while providing a regressive rebate to households according to household size, regardless of income level. He has argued that this would ensure transparency in the tax system and incentivize the private sector to create [...] "tens of millions of jobs." [...] In June 2016, Johnson said that he supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, stating that he previously was skeptical [...] "because these trade agreements are just laden with crony capitalism," [...] but is now informed it, in fact, fosters free trade.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Congress {{passed and}} Reagan {{signed into law}} tax {{increases}} of some nature in every year from 1981 to 1987 to continue funding such government programs as Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), Social Security, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DEFRA). Despite the fact that TEFRA was the [...] "largest peacetime tax increase in American history," [...] gross domestic product (GDP) growth recovered strongly after the early 1980s recession ended in 1982, and grew during his eight years in office {{at an annual rate}} of 7.9% per year, with a high of 12.2% growth in 1981. Unemployment peaked at 10.8% monthly rate in December 1982—higher than any time since the Great Depression—then dropped during the rest of Reagan's presidency. Sixteen million new jobs were created, while inflation significantly decreased. The Tax Reform Act of 1986, another bipartisan effort championed by Reagan, simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets to four and slashing a number of tax breaks. The top rate was dropped to 28%, but capital <b>gains</b> <b>taxes</b> were increased on those with the highest incomes from 20% to 28%. The increase of the lowest tax bracket from 11% to 15% was more than offset by expansion of the personal exemption, standard deduction, and earned income tax credit. The net result was the removal of six million poor Americans from the income tax roll and a reduction of income tax liability at all income levels.|$|E
