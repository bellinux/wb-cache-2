25|$|As the 19th century dawned, Florida {{had been}} undisputed Spanish {{territory}} for almost 250 years, aside from 20 years of British control between the French and Indian Wars and the American Revolution. Although a sparsely inhabited swampland, expansionist-minded Americans {{were eager to}} grab it and already, in 1808, American settlers had invaded the westernmost tip of Florida and expelled the local Spanish authorities, after which Congress hastily passed a bill annexing it under {{the claim that the}} Louisiana Purchase had guaranteed the territory to the United States. During the War of 1812, American troops occupied and seized the area around Mobile Bay. Spain, then engulfed in war with France, did not react to either of these actions. Also taking advantage of the mother country's distraction, Spain's Latin American colonies rose up in revolt and Madrid was forced to denude Florida of troops to suppress the rebellions. The result of this was that law and order practically broke <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>Florida</b> and a horde of Indians, pirates, and other troublemakers began raiding across the border into the US. In 1818, Andrew Jackson led an army into Florida to quell the chaotic situation there. He arrested and hanged two British agents who had been encouraging Indian raids, leading to an outcry in London and calls for war. However, cooler heads prevailed and the situation did not escalate further. A year later, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams negotiated the Adams-Onis Treaty with Spain. The Spanish agreed to turn over the no-longer-defensible Florida to the US and also give up their extremely flimsy claims to the distant Oregon Territory, in exchange for which American claims on Texas were renounced (some Americans had also been claiming parts of that territory under the Louisiana Purchase). The heretofore vague border between the US and Spanish North America was also settled upon. Although American designs on Texas did not disappear, they were put on the backburner for the more immediately important Florida.|$|E

Dan Forcella from TV Fanatics, on the other hand, praised Catherine Tate's acting and her character, writing, [...] "Tate's first appearance last season was intriguing, and her stint as head honcho <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>Florida</b> was entertaining, but in [...] "Get the Girl" [...] {{it became obvious that}} Nellie Bertram as branch manager could be exactly what The Office needs to stay afloat." ...|$|E
