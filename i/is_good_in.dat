5|$|Thomas Aquinas {{argued that}} {{statements}} about God are analogous to human experience. An analogous term is partly univocal (has only one meaning) and partly equivocal (has {{more than one}} potential meaning) because an analogy {{is in some ways}} the same and in some ways different from the subject. He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, {{it does not mean that}} God <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.|$|E

25|$|Cousin {{strongly}} {{insisted on}} the importance of method in philosophy. That which he adopts is the ordinary one of observation, analysis and induction. This observational method Cousin regards as that of the 18th century, the method which Descartes began and abandoned, and which Locke and Condillac applied, though imperfectly, and which Thomas Reid and Kant used with more success. He insists that this is the true method of philosophy as applied to consciousness, in which alone the facts of experience appear. But the proper condition of the application of the method is that it shall not, through prejudice of system, omit a single fact of consciousness. If the authority of consciousness <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> one instance, it <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> all. If not to be trusted in one, it is not to be trusted in any. Previous systems have erred in not presenting the facts of consciousness.|$|E

25|$|While {{drinking}} water <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> {{many parts of}} the country, there are still many concerns about the quality of water in streams and lakes. It has been estimated that surface water pollution is a threefold problem. Untreated effluents from urban wastewater (only 3% of wastewaters receive treatment) account for 20% of the problem, 40% from solid waste and industrial effluents (heavy metals are the primary culprit), and 40% from the agricultural sector. In the agriculture sector alone, 70% of pollution comes from debris of coffee plantations. Water basins that are receiving large quantities of contaminated runoff include the Grande de Tárcoles and Large Terraba rivers.|$|E

25|$|Reinforcement is the {{synergistic}} {{improvement of}} a total system’s strength created {{by the introduction of}} a geotextile, geogrid or geocell (all of which are good in tension) into a soil (that <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> compression, but poor in tension) or other disjointed and separated material. Applications of this function are in mechanically stabilized and retained earth walls and steep soil slopes; they can be combined with masonry facings to create vertical retaining walls. Also involved is the application of basal reinforcement over soft soils and over deep foundations for embankments and heavy surface loadings. Stiff polymer geogrids and geocells {{do not have to be}} held in tension to provide soil reinforcement, unlike geotextiles. Stiff 2D geogrid and 3D geocells interlock with the aggregate particles and the reinforcement mechanism is one of confinement of the aggregate. The resulting mechanically stabilized aggregate layer exhibits improved loadbearing performance.|$|E
25|$|Kulpahar region {{comprises}} areas {{which are}} essentially covered by grey, pink, red granitic rock and black dolerite. The rocks are generally medium to coarse to very coarse grained, having variegated colours with varying textural patterns. In geological nomenclature {{they can be}} classified {{on the basis of}} colour, grain size and texture. Over half of the areas identified so far appear suitable for extracting blocks of two cubic meters in size from the surface outcrops. The granite with red feldspar having presence of white and bluish quartz has caught the fancy of buyers and has become quite popular in national and international markets during the last 10 years, The remaining outcrops would be suited for blocks of smaller size. Ruby red granite <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> quality and is very popular in national and international markets, In granitic terrain the rocks may occur in the form of widespread sheets exposed above the ground level, in the form of hillocks, as high ground or below the ground under soil cover. They may also occur as boulders of different size and shapes spread over the sheet rock. They may be found as dykes, particularly of black and green types, as long narrow ridges often concealed beneath the surface. A major part of granite deposits in these regions are underground and have to be extracted by open cast mining. Underground granite block is more compact and require sophisticated and specialised machinery which adds to the cost of mining.|$|E

But I wouldn't bet on it. [...] " [...] Toomey also later added another review of the premiere, stating that [...] "I'm worried though. Dexter <b>is</b> <b>good.</b> <b>In</b> fact, it's really good. That's why I'm worried. Why? Because Showtime has a nasty little habit of canceling great shows. There was The Chris Isaak Show. Then Dead Like Me. The most recent casualty? Huff. All three of those shows were spectacular. And you know what? Dexter is better than all of them. So, yeah... I'm worried." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1694, herbalist John Pechey {{described}} A.auricula-judae {{by saying}} [...] "It grows to the Trunk of the Elder-Tree. Being dried {{it will keep}} a good year.

And being infus'd in some proper Water, it <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> Diseases of the Eyes." [...] The species also saw use as an astringent due to its ability to absorb water. There are recorded medicinal usages from Scotland, where it was again used as a gargle for sore throats, and from Ireland, where, {{in an attempt to}} cure jaundice, it was boiled in milk. The medicinal use of A.auricula-judae continued until at least 1860, when it was still sold at Covent Garden; at the time, it was not considered edible in the United Kingdom.|$|E

Lindow describes her as representing [...] "all that <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> the Upland culture". Her gift is the ability to communicate with animals; while still a child she is able to hear the speech of animals in the farms, and later she trains Coaly, a guide dog for Orrec. She refuses to use her gift to call animals to be hunted, and is depicted as edgy and resolute. Despite being young, she is depicted as caring deeply for other beings, She visits Orrec in his despair, and persuades him to tell her stories, drawing him out of his grief through his gift for poetry. After she marries Orrec and the two decide to leave, she says [...] "We might go as far as the ocean shore", suggesting that though the Uplands have become too limiting for them, their development is not complete.|$|E

500|$|Wenger welcomed Chelsea's emergence, {{describing}} {{them as the}} [...] "third force" [...] in English football, but {{he raised}} concerns over their conduct and what he perceived as artificial growth. Asked whether Chelsea could dominate for the foreseeable, Wenger said: [...] "I feel yes, because they are a financially doped club. [...] They have enhancement of performances through financial resources which are unlimited. For me, it's a kind of doping because it's {{not in any way}} linked to their resources." [...] Despite the absence of Thierry Henry, ruled out through injury, and Arsenal's poor recent record against Manchester United, Wenger believed his team were more than capable of winning the match: [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> football {{is that it is not}} predictable. [...] You act now like it is a decade that we haven’t beaten Manchester United – it's not true. It's two games."

500|$|A skillful, quick, agile, and {{prolific}} forward, who <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> the air, Benzema {{has been}} described as an [...] "immensely talented striker" [...] who is [...] "strong and powerful" [...] and [...] "a potent finisher from inside the box" [...] with both feet, despite being naturally right footed. An atypical number 9, although he is usually deployed as a centre-forward, Benzema is also capable of playing in several other offensive positions, and has been used on the wing, or even behind the main striker. In addition to his goalscoring, Benzema is indeed known for his willingness and ability to drop into deeper or wider positions, and either link-up play with midfielders as a number 10, or use his strength and technical ability to hold up the ball to provide assists for teammates, courtesy of his vision, creativity, passing, and eye for the final ball. He has also been praised for his work-rate and tactical intelligence off the ball, as well as his attacking movement as a forward, which often draws opposition defenders out of position, and in turn creates spaces for Cristiano Ronaldo to make attacking runs into the centre of the area from the left wing.|$|E
500|$|The Less Deceived {{was first}} noticed by The Times, who {{included}} {{it in its}} List of Books of 1955. In its wake many other reviews followed; [...] "most of them concentrated ... on the book's emotional impact and its sophisticated, witty language." [...] The Spectator felt the collection was [...] "in the running for the best published in this country since the war"; G. S. Fraser, referring to Larkin's perceived association with The Movement felt that Larkin exemplified [...] "everything that <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> this 'new movement' and none of its faults". The TLS called him [...] "a poet of quite exceptional importance", and in June 1956 the Times Educational Supplement was fulsome: [...] "As native as a Whitstable oyster, as sharp an expression of contemporary thought and experience as anything written in our time, as immediate in its appeal as the lyric poetry of an earlier day, {{it may well be}} regarded by posterity as a poetic monument that marks the triumph over the formless mystifications of the last twenty years. With Larkin poetry is on its way back to the middlebrow public." [...] Reviewing the book in America the poet Robert Lowell wrote, [...] "No post-war poetry has so caught the moment, and caught it without straining after its ephemera. It's a hesitant, groping mumble, resolutely experienced, resolutely perfect in its artistic methods." ...|$|E
