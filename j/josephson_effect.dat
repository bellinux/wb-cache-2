40|$|We {{investigate}} the quantum dynamics of an experimentally realized spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate {{in a double}} well potential. The spin-orbit coupling can significantly enhance the atomic inter-well tunneling. We find the coexistence of internal and external <b>Josephson</b> <b>effects</b> in the system, which are moreover inherently coupled in a complicated form {{even in the absence}} of interatomic interactions. Moreover, we show that the spin-dependent tunneling between two wells can induce a net atomic spin current referred as spin <b>Josephson</b> <b>effects.</b> Such novel spin <b>Josephson</b> <b>effects</b> can be observable for realistically experimental conditions.

40|$|We report DC <b>Josephson</b> <b>effects</b> {{observed}} in a microbridge prepared from an individual crystalline growth domain of CeCoIn_ 5 thin film. <b>Josephson</b> <b>effects</b> were observed by periodic voltage modulations under external magnetic field Δ V(B) with the expected periodicity and by the temperature dependence of the Josephson critical current I_c(T). The shape of Δ V(B) {{was found to be}} asymmetric, as it is expected for microbridges. The dependence I_c(T) follows the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation, which is unexpected for microbridges. Features in the dynamical resistance curves were attributed to the periodic motion of Abricosov vortices within the microbridge. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Physica...|$|R

500|$|Brian David Josephson, [...] (born 4 January 1940), is a Welsh {{theoretical}} {{physicist and}} {{professor emeritus of}} physics at the University of Cambridge. Best known for his pioneering work on superconductivity and quantum tunnelling, {{he was awarded the}} Nobel Prize in Physics in 1973 for his prediction of the <b>Josephson</b> <b>effect,</b> made in 1962 when he was a 22-year-old PhD student at Cambridge University.

500|$|Josephson was 22 {{years old}} when he did the work on quantum {{tunnelling}} that won him the Nobel Prize. He discovered that a supercurrent could tunnel through a thin barrier, predicting, according to physicist Andrew Whitaker, that [...] "at a junction of two superconductors, a current will flow even if there is no drop in voltage; that when there is a voltage drop, the current should oscillate at a frequency related to the drop in voltage; {{and that there is a}} dependence on any magnetic field." [...] This became known as the <b>Josephson</b> <b>effect</b> and the junction as a Josephson junction.|$|E
40|$|We {{discover}} novel topological pumps in the <b>Josephson</b> <b>effects</b> for superconductors. The phase difference, {{which is}} odd under the chiral symmetry {{defined by the}} product of time-reversal and particle-hole symmetries, acts as an anomalous adiabatic parameter. These pumping cycles {{are different from those}} in the "periodic table", and are characterized by Z× Z or Z_ 2 × Z_ 2 strong invariants. We determine the general classifications in class AIII, and those in class DIII with a single anomalous parameter. For the Z_ 2 × Z_ 2 topological pump in class DIII, one Z_ 2 invariant describes the coincidence of fermion parity and spin pumps whereas the other one reflects the non-Abelian statistics of Majorana Kramers pairs, leading to three distinct fractional <b>Josephson</b> <b>effects.</b> Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures, and 2 table...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} SIS Josephson {{junctions}} have a threshold resistance, above which the Josephson coupling and the supercurrents become extremely small, {{due to the}} shrinking of the Cooper pair size during the Josephson tunneling. Accordingly, the threshold resistance is smaller for higher Tc superconductors with small Cooper pair size and for the insulating barrier with higher resistance. This understanding agrees with the observations in SIS junctions of low Tc superconductors, such as Sn, Pb, and Nb. For MgB 2 it explains why the big gap does not show the supercurrents, unlike the small gap. Furthermore, it {{is consistent with the}} fact that high Tc cuprates show the <b>Josephson</b> <b>effects</b> only for SNS type junctions, including the intrinsic <b>Josephson</b> <b>effects.</b> Comment: Proceedings of LT 24 Conference, 2 pages, 1 figure.

500|$|Josephson {{was known}} at Cambridge as a brilliant, but shy, student. Physicist John Waldram {{recalled}} overhearing Nicholas Kurti, an examiner from Oxford, discuss Josephson's exam results with David Shoenberg, the reader in physics at Cambridge, and asking: [...] "Who is this chap Josephson? He {{seems to be}} going through the theory like a knife through butter." [...] While still an undergraduate, he published a paper on the Mössbauer effect, pointing out a crucial issue other researchers had overlooked. According to one eminent physicist speaking to Physics World, Josephson wrote several papers important enough to assure him a place in the history of physics even without his discovery of the <b>Josephson</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{mathematical}} models used {{in classical}} electromagnetism, quantum electrodynamics (QED) {{and the standard}} model all view the electromagnetic vacuum as a linear system with no overall observable consequence (e.g. {{in the case of}} the Casimir effect, Lamb shift, and so on) these phenomena can be explained by alternative mechanisms other than action of the vacuum by arbitrary changes to the normal ordering of field operators. See alternative theories section). This is a consequence of viewing electromagnetism as a U(1) gauge theory, which topologically does not allow the complex interaction of a field with and on itself. In higher symmetry groups and in reality, the vacuum is not a calm, randomly fluctuating, largely immaterial and passive substance, but at times can be viewed as a turbulent virtual plasma that can have complex vortices (i.e. solitons vis-à-vis particles), entangled states and a rich nonlinear structure. There are many observed nonlinear physical electromagnetic phenomena such as Aharonov–Bohm (AB) and Altshuler–Aronov–Spivak (AAS) effects, Berry, Aharonov– Anandan, Pancharatnam and Chiao–Wu phase rotation effects, <b>Josephson</b> <b>effect,</b> ...|$|E

This dissertation summarizes the current progress in developing superfluid helium weak links along with the study of their associated <b>Josephson</b> <b>effects,</b> including the theoretical concepts and the experimental realizations in a superfluid 3 He system. This research has culminated in the development and experimental success of a superfluid 3 He dc SQUID and the first observation of quantum interference in a liquid.
