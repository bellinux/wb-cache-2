5|$|After World War II, Syracuse University {{began to}} {{transform}} {{into a major}} research institution. Enrollment increased {{in the four years}} after the war due to the G.I. Bill, which paid tuition, room, board, and a small allowance <b>for</b> <b>veterans</b> returning from World War II.

She was herself a bereaved mother, as her son, Prince Maurice of Battenberg, had been killed in action during the First Battle of Ypres. Rare public appearances after his death included commemorations, including laying wreaths at the Cenotaph in 1930 and 1935 to mark the 10th and 15th anniversaries of the founding of the League.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{advocate}} for the many thousands of returned servicemen and women many ex-services organisations sprang up. The most prominent of these was probably the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia which had been established in 1916 by representatives from many state-based organisations already in existence. Following the war this organisation grew in its political influence as its numbers grew and was very active in the repatriation process, advocating for financial entitlements <b>for</b> <b>veterans</b> and securing concessions for soldiers returning to civilian employment. By 1919 it was estimated to have 150,000 members although this fell dramatically in the mid-1920s.|$|E

He also sponsored legislation to organize the Indian Territory under a territorial government.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{supported}} Ernst, and Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover campaigned in {{the state}} on his behalf. Ernst had opposed a bonus <b>for</b> <b>veterans</b> of World War I, an unpopular position in Kentucky, and at 68 years old, his age worked against him. Barkley contrasted his impoverished upbringing with Ernst's affluent lifestyle as a corporate lawyer, and also attacked him for supporting Michigan Senator Truman Handy Newberry, who resigned due to allegations of election fraud. Republican voters were angered that Ernst did not support Republican Kentucky Congressman John W. Langley when Langley was charged with illegally aiding a large bootlegging operation in Louisville. Ernst tried to resurrect the issues of Barkley's support for the coal tax and opposition to parimutuel betting, but in the general election, Barkley won {{by a vote of}} 287,997 to 266,657.|$|E
5|$|In time Sérurier became {{vice-president}} of the Senate and in 1803 was appointed {{president of a}} commission that determined the border between France and Piedmont.

Out of 18 marshals appointed on this date, the other three honorary ones were Bon Adrien Jeannot de Moncey, François Christophe de Kellermann and Catherine-Dominique de Pérignon. Sérurier was awarded the Grand Eagle of the Légion d'Honneur and the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Iron Crown. He was ennobled as a Count of the Empire in 1808 and granted a pension of 40,000 francs per year.|$|E

5|$|Legislation {{was passed}} in 1988 that removed the need <b>for</b> <b>veterans</b> to prove a causal link between certain forms of cancer and {{radiation}} exposure due to nuclear tests. Incidence of the main expected causes of this increased mortality, leukemia and other cancers, was not significantly higher than normal. Death by those diseases was tabulated {{on the assumption that}} if radiation exposure had a life-shortening effect it would likely show up there, but it did not. Not enough data were gathered on other causes of death to determine the reason for this increase in all-cause mortality, and it remains a mystery. The mortality increase was higher, 5.7%, for those who boarded target ships after the tests than for those who did not, whose mortality increase was only 4.3%.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the NFLPA {{declared}} itself an independent union, many players were dissatisfied {{with the lack of}} compensation teams provided and voted to strike on July 3, 1968 after official discussions with the owners stalled. The owners countered by declaring a lockout. By July 14, 1968, the brief work stoppage came to an end. Although a CBA resulted, many players felt that the agreement did not net them as many benefits as they had hoped. The owners agreed to contribute about $1.5 million to the pension fund with minimum salaries of $9,000 for rookies, $10,000 <b>for</b> <b>veterans</b> and $50 per exhibition game; there was at yet no neutral arbitration for disputes.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{headquarters}} {{were again}} reactivated on 1 December 2006 at Fort Drum, by reflagging 2nd Brigade, 78th Division (Training Support).

The brigade, which is headquartered at Fort Drum and is subordinate to the First Army Division East, is responsible for early stages of training for other reserve soldiers who have been alerted for deployment. The brigade offers the opportunity <b>for</b> <b>veterans</b> of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom to use their skills to train new soldiers who will be entering the field of operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. This training includes convoy live-fire training exercises, and techniques in dealing with improvised explosive devices, which are the primary cause of casualties in the operations.|$|E

5|$|The players went {{on strike}} on July 13, 1970 after the owners locked them out for a brief period. The strike lasted for two days ending with a new four year CBA which was reached after the owners {{threatened}} to cancel the season. Due to the new agreement, the union won the right for players to bargain through their own agents with the clubs, and minimum salaries were increased to $12,500 for rookies and $13,000 <b>for</b> <b>veterans.</b> Also, players' pensions were improved and dental care {{was added to the}} players' insurance plans. Players also gained the right to select representation on the league's retirement board and the right to impartial arbitration for injury grievances. Following the 1970 agreement, many union representatives were released by their teams. Unfazed, the players were determined to create a stronger union through better communication. Attorney Ed Garvey was hired by the NFLPA in 1971 to act as their first executive director, and the NFLPA became officially certified as a union by the NLRB the same year. Headquarters were established in Washington, D.C. and a campaign was launched to help inform players of their rights.|$|E
