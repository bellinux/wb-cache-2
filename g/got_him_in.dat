His defiance {{of what he called}} arbitrary authority <b>got</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> trouble occasionally. In 1824, two years {{after the death of his}} father, he left the Navy, married, and was admitted to the bar in Maryland. Though he was well respected in his abilities as a lawyer, he had few clients and the business failed. His wife, Georgiana McCausland, would become a supportive and inspirational figure to him.|$|E
25|$|Bagman loves gambling, which <b>got</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> {{financial}} trouble {{so severe that}} he pays some of his creditors (including Fred and George Weasley) with disappearing Leprechaun Gold, after they have gambled on the Quidditch World Cup. After the World Cup final, some goblins corner him in the woods outside the stadium and take all the gold he had on him, which {{is not enough to}} cover his debts. To clear his debts with the goblins, Bagman makes a bet on the Triwizard Tournament, of which {{he is one of the}} judges. He bets the goblins that Harry would win. He tries to help Harry over the course of the Tournament, giving him a perfect score in the First Task even though he is injured, and offering him advice. Harry and Cedric Diggory end up tying for first place in the tournament, and Bagman does not win the bet as the goblins argue that Bagman was betting Harry would win outright. Bagman runs away after the Third Task of the Tournament.|$|E

All we've <b>got</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the nets is bowling offspin, offspin, offspin. It's repetition all the time and he's getting better and better at it. He's a very fast learner." ...|$|E

At the time, Cruceta had in his arsenal a fastball (which topped out at [...] ), slider, and changeup. John Farrell, then the Indians director of player development, praised Cruceta's mechanics: [...] "He throws the ball on a downward plane. It allows the action of all his pitches to work down and force ground-ball outs. We're ecstatic that we <b>got</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the Rodriguez trade." [...] Cruceta enjoyed a strong year at Akron, going 13–9 with a 3.09 ERA. Cruceta returned to the Aeros for the 2004 season, and in mid-June the Indians promoted him to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons, where he went 6–5 with a 3.25 ERA as the Bisons defeated the Richmond Braves for the International League championship and the Governors' Cup. Following the series Cruceta was one of six Bisons players called up by the Indians for the fall expansion.|$|E
