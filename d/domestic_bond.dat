If the central bank were to conduct open market operations in the <b>domestic</b> <b>bond</b> market in order to offset these balance-of-payments-induced changes in the money supply — a process called sterilization, it would absorb newly arrived money by decreasing its holdings of domestic bonds (or the opposite if money were flowing out of the country).

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the conditions under}} which expected inflation might influence the money demand, using a microeconomic model where the transactions of the representative agent are facilitated by its holdings of money. We assume that the agent holds a real asset, along with a range of nominal assets, that may include domestic money, foreign money, <b>domestic</b> <b>bonds</b> and foreign bonds. In this model, the optimal choice between money and bonds is embedded in a portfolio choice between the real asset and risky assets (the Merton problem). We show that, as long as the agent is not constrained in her holdings of bonds, the demand for domestic money will not, in general, depend on expected inflation. The demand for money may however become a positive function of the inflation rate in case the agent is constrained in her holdings of foreign bonds. The only case in which the demand for domestic money may depend negatively on the inflation rate is when the agent faces a binding constraint in her holdings of <b>domestic</b> <b>bonds.</b> COMPETE; QREN; FEDER; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|R

40|$|The home bias is {{observed}} {{in the composition of}} portfolios of different classes of financial assets. The literature offers conflicting arguments about the rationality of this behavior {{in the case of the}} portfolios invested in short-term securities, commonly known as currency deposits. In the context of an economy subject to strong volatility, the conventional wisdom suggests that conservative investors should concentrate these deposits on <b>domestic</b> <b>bonds.</b> However, these instruments can be very risky for a long-term investor due to uncertainty about the future short-term interest rate. Not least important, under the assumption of uncovered interest parity, it may be optimal for this investor to maintain foreign currency deposits as a hedge against a deterioration of the domestic investment opportunities. On the root of this argument is the fact that the lower expected return on <b>domestic</b> <b>bonds,</b> as it stimulates the outflow of capital, it is accompanied by real depreciation of the domestic currency. Therefore, the foreign currency deposits reduce the volatility of future wealth as the size of current wealth tends to increase when its expected return decreases. This work evaluates the effectiveness of the foreign currency deposits as an intertemporal hedge for Brazilian long-term investors. The main conclusion is that fairly conservative investors should allocate significant part of these deposits in dollars, pounds and ienes...|$|R

50|$|In {{the second}} {{version of the}} {{original}} sin hypothesis, Barry Eichengreen, Ricardo Hausmann and Ugo Panizza in 2002 discarded the domestic element of original sin and redefined (international) original sin as {{a situation in which}} most countries cannot borrow abroad in their own currency. They showed that almost all of the countries (except US, Euro area, Japan, UK, and Switzerland) suffered from (international) original sin over time. Eichengreen, et al. concluded that weaknesses of national macroeconomic policies and institutions are not statistically related with original sin and found that the only statistically robust determinant of original sin was country size. Moreover, they claimed that international transaction costs, network externalities, and global capital market imperfections were the main reasons (which are beyond the control of an individual country) of the original sin. Hence, as a solution for the original sin problem, they proposed an international initiative and recommended development of a basket index of emerging-market currencies so that international financial institutions could issue debt denominated in this index until a liquid-market in this index had developed. Burger and Warnock (2003) suggested inclusion of information on <b>domestic</b> <b>bond</b> markets to account for the possibility that foreign investors were holding local-currency emerging market bonds to analyze the determinants of original sin. Using this expanded measure, they showed that emerging markets economies could develop local bond markets (in which they can borrow in domestic currency) and attract global investors with stronger institutions and credible domestic policies. Reinhart, Rogoff and Savastano (2003) criticized the suggested international solution for the original sin problem by claiming that the main problem of emerging market economies is to learn how to borrow less (debt intolerance) rather than learn how to borrow more in their domestic currency.|$|E
5000|$|In 1913 the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad {{commonly}} referred to as the [...] "New Haven" [...] had been struggling for several reasons: an Interstate Commerce Investigation, an unusually high frequency of wrecks causing great loss of life, poor management, a growing distrust from the public under intensifying criticism, and two lawsuits resulting in the indictment of former president New Haven Charles S.

Then to make matters worse, {{for the first time in}} 40 years the dividend was skipped. J.L. Richards was invited on October 22, 1913 to join the 27 man Board of Directors. This pedigreed group included Arthur T. Hadley of Yale, William Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan of New York. Richards used his previous railroad knowledge studying the company's history very carefully. He concluded the company could be turned around. He bought more and more stock as the price was depressed. Soon he became the largest individual stockholder in the company. Early in 1914, Richards was named to the executive committee to replace J.P.

Even though the New Haven’s balance sheet was looking better since those tenuous days in 1913, most bankers were reluctant to take on a debt this large. When the Boston finance team, headed up by Richards met the New York bankers at the House of Morgan, J.P. Morgan himself warned “If you can get the money enough to pay down 10% of the loan and get an extension for the balance, you will be fortunate.The commission charges on a bond issue for $23,000,000 would be tremendous, if such an issue could be sold at all”.|$|E
