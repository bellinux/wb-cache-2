25|$|In electromagnetism, {{permittivity}} or absolute permittivity, usually {{denoted by}} the Greek letter ε (epsilon), {{is the measure}} of resistance that is encountered when forming an electric field in a particular medium. More specifically, permittivity describes the amount of charge needed to generate one unit of <b>electric</b> <b>flux</b> in a particular medium. Accordingly, a charge will yield more <b>electric</b> <b>flux</b> in a medium with low permittivity than in a medium with high permittivity. Thus, permittivity is the measure of a material's ability to resist an electric field, not its ability to ‘permit’ it (as the name ‘permittivity’ might seem to suggest).|$|E
25|$|The model {{states that}} the colour <b>electric</b> <b>flux</b> between a quark and an {{antiquark}} collapses into a string, rather than spreading out into a Coulomb field as the normal <b>electric</b> <b>flux</b> does. This string also obeys a different force law. It behaves as if the string had constant tension, so that separating out the ends (quarks) would give a potential energy increasing linearly with the separation. When the energy is {{higher than that of}} a meson, the string breaks and the two new ends become a quark-antiquark pair, thus describing the creation of a meson. Thus confinement is incorporated naturally into the model.|$|E

2500|$|Gauss's law {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} a static electric field and the electric charges that cause it: The static electric field points away from positive charges and towards negative charges. In the field line description, electric field lines begin only at positive electric charges and end only at negative electric charges. [...] 'Counting' the number of field lines passing through a closed surface, therefore, yields the total charge (including bound charge due to polarization of material) enclosed by that surface divided by dielectricity of free space (the vacuum permittivity). More technically, it relates the <b>electric</b> <b>flux</b> through any hypothetical closed [...] "Gaussian surface" [...] to the enclosed electric charge.|$|E

Instead, he looked for a [...] "continuous" [...] solution, meaning one that didn't interrupt the <b>electric</b> <b>flux.</b> In 1856, Meucci reportedly constructed the first electromagnetic telephone, made of an electromagnet with a nucleus {{in the shape of a}} horseshoe bat, a diaphragm of animal skin, stiffened with potassium dichromate and a metal disk stuck in the middle. The instrument was housed in a cylindrical carton box. He purportedly constructed it to connect his second-floor bedroom to his basement laboratory, and thus communicate with his invalid wife.|$|E
40|$|We {{study center}} vortex free {{energies}} and ’t Hooft’s <b>electric</b> <b>fluxes</b> on the lattice in 2 + 1 dimen-sions, where SU(2) for example, {{is in the}} universality class of the 2 d Ising model. This places a wealth of exact results at our fingertips. In particular, spacelike center vortices in SU(2) near criticality correspond to spin interfaces in the 2 d Ising model, whose universal scaling functions are known exactly. We exploit this to locate the deconfinement transition with unprecedented precision and subsequently for a finite size scaling analysis, where the self-duality of the 2 d spin model is reflected in a duality between the spacelike vortices and confining <b>electric</b> <b>fluxes.</b> The corresponding relation between the string tension and its dual in the high temperature phase is arguably the simplest example of a universal amplitude ratio.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that the {{internal}} dynamics of a baryon, as a bound state of QCD-strings and quarks, may be captured by a theory of matrix coordinates. PACS: 12. 38. Aw, 11. 25. Tq, 11. 25. Uv, 02. 10. Yn 1 There is a relatively common belief that gauge theories have some kinds of string theory as their dual description. The supports for this belief come from some phenomenological facts, such as Regge trajectories, and also some theoretical considerations, like those coming from large-N and lattice gauge theories [1][2]. In the theoretical side, the gauge/gravity duality in the AdS limit of brane backgrounds [3] has realized the idea by a definite relation between the objects in two sides [4]. The loop-space formulation [5] {{is another example of}} efforts for string theoretic presentation of gauge theory dynamics, still exciting theoretical research [6].

40|$|Abstract. In the {{ordinary}} quantum Maxwell theory {{of a free}} electromagnetic field, formulated on a curved 3 -manifold, we observe that magnetic and <b>electric</b> <b>fluxes</b> cannot be simultaneously measured. This uncertainty principle reflects torsion: fluxes modulo torsion can be simultaneously measured. We also develop the Hamilton theory of self-dual fields, noting that they are quantized by Pontrjagin selfdual cohomology theories and that the quantum Hilbert space is Z/ 2 Z-graded, so typically contains both bosonic and fermionic states. Fluxes in the classical theory of electromagnetism and its generalizations are real-valued and Poisson-commute. Our main result is a Heisenberg uncertainty principle in the quantum theory: magnetic and <b>electric</b> <b>fluxes</b> cannot be measured simultaneously. This observation applies to any abelian gauge field, including the standard Maxwell field theory in four spacetime dimensions {{as well as the}} B-field and Ramond-Ramond fields in string theories. It is the torsion part of the fluxes which experience uncertainty—the nontrivial commutator of torsion fluxes is computed by the link pairing on the cohomology of space, and there are always nontrivial commutators if torsion is present. We remark that torsion fluxes arise from Dirac charge/flux quantization. This Heisenberg uncertainty relation goes against the conventional wisdom that the quantum Hilber...|$|R
