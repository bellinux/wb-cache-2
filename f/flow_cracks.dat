40|$|Cracks are {{prevalent}} in near-ground-surface soils and provide preferential pathways for fluid <b>flow.</b> <b>Cracks</b> increase water infiltration or contaminant solute transport into soils. This paper studies {{the development of}} a permeability tensor and a representative elementary volume (REV) for saturated cracked soils. First, a method of generating random crack networks based on the statistical parameters of the crack geometry is presented. Then, the permeability tensor and REV for a crack network are studied by modeling water flow through the generated random crack networks. Finally, the permeability tensor for a cracked soil is obtained by combining the crack network and the soil matrix, and the properties of the permeability tensor and the REV for the cracked soils are investigated. Results show that the permeability tensor can be used to represent the permeability anisotropy of a cracked soil. An REV can be readily established when the crack network is relatively dense. An REV can be defined and the contribution of the crack network to permeability is small when a crack network exists in homogeneous sands. An REV is harder to establish and the hydraulic conductivity is dominated by the random crack network when a sparse crack network exists in clays...|$|E

50|$|When water <b>flows</b> through <b>cracks</b> {{present in}} concrete, water may {{dissolve}} various minerals {{present in the}} hardened cement paste or in the aggregates, if the solution is unsaturated with respect to them. Dissolved ions, such as calcium (Ca2+), are leached out and transported in solution some distance. If the physico-chemical conditions prevailing in the seeping water evolve with distance along the water path and water becomes supersaturated with respect to certain minerals, they can further precipitate, making calthemite deposits (predominately calcium carbonate) inside the cracks, or at the concrete outer surface. This process can cause the self-healing of fractures in particular conditions.|$|R

40|$|In this investigation, we are {{primarily}} concerned with modeling fluid <b>flow</b> through vertical <b>cracks</b> that were created {{for the purpose of}} extracting heat from hot, dry rock masses. The basic equation for the two-dimensional problem of fluid <b>flow</b> through a <b>crack</b> is presented and an approximate solution is found. The basic equation is a non-linear, Cauchy-singular integro-differential equation. Moderately simple formulae for the crack opening displacement and the effective pressure difference between the crack tips are derived. The results are valid for arbitrary vertical cracks, provided that the fluid injection and removal points are not placed too close to the crack tips. (A more complete treatment of this problem is given by us in a paper to appear in the Journal of Geophysical Research.) There are two corrections that can be made to our results. One of these is for the influence of the earth’s surface. Another correction takes into account the force in the vertical direction produced at the crack walls by the fluid pressure because the crack walls are not vertical when the crack is filled with fluid. It can be shown (Weertman and Chang, Ref. 6) that both of these corrections are negligibly small. We conclude from this analysis that the crack profile and stress intensity factors of any large vertical fluid-filled crack for heat extraction purposes will not be changed appreciably when fluid is forced to <b>flow</b> through the <b>crack</b> at physically practical velocities. 6 refs...|$|R

40|$|Vertisols {{are widely}} used for {{irrigated}} rice in the Senegal River Basin, where farmers are increasingly reporting problems with soil salinization. Water movement {{at the onset of}} the growing season, when soils are dry and cracked, may have a large impact on soil salinity and water economy. Water movement and soil swelling processes were studied in a dry, cracked vertisol in the Senegal River Valley. Surface irrigation and simulated rainfall (intensity 88 mm/h) on cracked 2. 25 m 2 plots (crack width 0. 01 - 0. 02 m; crack depth 0. 3 m) resulted in crack closure within 4. 5 h, starting at the soil surface. Soil swelling was separated into two components : swelling of the 0. 01 - 0. 02 m border zone of a soil island (soil mass distinctively separated by cracks), and swelling of the rest of the soil island as a whole. Soil swelling was heterogeneous, with a very rapid expansion of the border zone. At the moment of crack closure, the relative contributions of these two components to crack closure were respectively 80 - 90 % and 10 - 20 % 24 h later these percentages changed slightly only. Maximum bulk linear shrinkage determined at the field level was only 7 %. Results indicate the importance of rapid, local, heterogeneous swelling processes to water <b>flow</b> into <b>cracked</b> vertisol, resulting in limited bypass flow. Use of bulk shrinkage curves and assumptions on isotropy of shrinkage and swelling processes when modelling water and solute <b>flow</b> in <b>cracked</b> vertisols should therefore be done with great care.

40|$|A unified {{theory of}} global and squirt <b>flow</b> in <b>cracked</b> porous media was {{developed}} {{several years ago}} {{on the basis of a}} combination of the dynamic T-matrix approach to rock physics. The theory has been successfully used to model ultrasonic velocity and attenuation anisotropy measurements in real rocks under pressure. At the same time, it was recently pointed out that this theory, which contain an established theory of interconnected cracks as a special case contains an error related to fluid mass conservation. The error was recently corrected, and this paper represents an attempt to perform a systematic study of the implications of unified theory for the relative importance of global and squirt <b>flow</b> in <b>cracked</b> porous media characterized by different microstructures and fluid mobilities. Our numerical results suggest that squirt flow dominates over global flow and global flow appears to be more important at higher frequencies for more realistic models of microstructure. The attenuation peak of squirt flow move towards lower frequencies with the increasing fluid viscosity i. e. changing saturating fluid from water to oil, while the global flow attenuation peak move towards higher frequencies with increasing fluid viscosity. A previous observation of negative velocity dispersion in unified theory still remain, even if we use the correct effective wave number, when dealing with the phenomenon of wave-induced fluid flow in models of cracked porous media where global flow effects dominates. The attenuation peak of the global flow obtained using the correct wave number is always shifted to the left as compared to the approximate solution. At seismic frequencies global flow effects are not so important and needs very high permeability and low viscosity to have an effect...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Clayey and saline soils {{have been}} shown to be {{problematic}} for time domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements. This study presents some of these problems and discusses solutions to them. Thirteen solute transport experiments were carried out in three undisturbed soil columns of swelling clay soil from Tunisia, labelled SI, S 2, and S 3 respectively. The columns were collected at three different physiographical regions within a catchment. Water fluxes ranged from 1. 2 to 7. 2 cm day " 1. The large solute transport heterogeneity and large tailing indicated that preferential flow was most pronounced in SI. The preferential flow took place in voids between structural elements and in wormholes. In S 3, preferential flow was also evident, but not to the same extent as in S 1. In S 2, the solute transport was more uniform with little preferential flow. The heterogeneity of the solute transport increased with the water flux in SI and to a smaller extent in S 3, whereas it remained constant in S 2. In a previous dye experiment in the field, preferential <b>flow</b> in <b>cracks</b> was observed at those sites where SI and S 3 were collected. In the column experiments, preferential <b>flow</b> in these <b>cracks</b> was less due to the higher initial water content compared to the dye experiments, indicating that th...|$|R
