5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical <b>Hadley</b> <b>cell</b> and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the <b>Hadley</b> <b>cell</b> circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E
5|$|All winds on Venus are {{ultimately}} driven by convection. Hot air {{rises in the}} equatorial zone, where solar heating is concentrated, and flows to the poles. Such an almost-planetwide overturning of the troposphere is called Hadley circulation. However, the meridional air motions are much slower than zonal winds. The poleward limit of the planet wide <b>Hadley</b> <b>cell</b> on Venus is near ±60° latitudes. Here air starts to descend {{and returns to the}} equator below the clouds. This interpretation is supported by the distribution of the carbon monoxide, which is also concentrated in the vicinity of ±60° latitudes. Poleward of the <b>Hadley</b> <b>cell</b> a different pattern of circulation is observed. In the latitude range 60°–70° cold polar collars exist. They are characterised by temperatures about 30–40K lower than in the upper troposphere at nearby latitudes. The lower temperature is probably caused by the upwelling of the air in them and by the resulting adiabatic cooling. Such an interpretation is supported by the denser and higher clouds in the collars. The clouds lie at 70–72km altitude in the collars—about 5km higher than at the poles and low latitudes. A connection may exist between the cold collars and high speed midlatitude jets in which winds blow as fast as 140m/s. Such jets are a natural consequence of the Hadley–type circulation and should exist on Venus between 55–60° latitude.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Helene {{can be traced}} back to an easterly wave that formed near Cape Verde on September16. Moving towards the west due to trade winds {{associated}} with the <b>Hadley</b> <b>cell,</b> the disturbance gradually intensified. On September 20, ships in the system's vicinity reported widespread shower activity and generally low barometric pressures. Early the following day, a reconnaissance flight reported evidence of a weak circulation, with gusts of 35 mph (55 km/h) in heavy squalls surrounding the circulation center. At 0200 UTC later that day, the United States Weather Bureau office in San Juan, Puerto Rico began issuing bulletins on the system for public interests. In HURDAT, the tropical wave was first classified as a tropical depression at 0600 UTC on September 21, well east of the Leeward Antilles. At the time, the depression had maximum sustained winds of 30 mph (50 km/h).|$|E

500|$|Surface {{temperature}} {{differences in}} turn cause pressure differences. A hot surface warms {{the air above}} it causing it to expand and lower the density and the resulting surface air pressure. The resulting horizontal pressure gradient moves the air from higher to lower pressure regions, creating a wind, and the Earth's rotation then causes deflection of this air flow due to the Coriolis effect.

500|$|Heating of {{the earth}} near the equator leads to large amounts of {{convection}} along the monsoon trough or Intertropical convergence zone. [...] This air mass rises to the lower stratosphere where it diverges, {{moving away from the}} equator in the upper troposphere in both northerly and southerly directions. As it moves towards the mid-latitudes {{on both sides of the}} equator, the air cools and sinks. The resulting air mass subsidence creates a subtropical ridge of high pressure near the 30th parallel in both hemispheres. At the surface level, the sinking air diverges again with some returning to the equator, completing the Hadley circulation. [...] This circulation on each side of the equator is known as the <b>Hadley</b> <b>cell</b> and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge. [...] Many of the world's deserts are caused by these climatological high-pressure areas.|$|E
500|$|Weather {{is driven}} by air pressure, {{temperature}} and moisture differences between one place and another. [...] These differences can occur due to the sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies with latitude.

[...] Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. [...] Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. [...] On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40°C (−40°F to 100°F) annually. [...] Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) {{is an area}} of {{convection}} encircling {{the earth}} near the equator where the northern and southern hemisphere (SH) <b>Hadley</b> <b>cells</b> converge. If a forcing (e. g. aerosol emissions decline) results in a greater net influx of heat into one hemisphere the <b>Hadley</b> <b>cells</b> will shift across the equator to transport heat from the warmer to the cooler hemisphere resulting in a shift of the annual mean location of the ITCZ. Shifts in the annual mean location of the ITCZ can significantly impact the nearly 3 billion who live in the tropics and depend on the ITCZ as a source of freshwater. Recent studies have shown {{the extent to which the}} <b>Hadley</b> <b>cells</b> will shift is dependent not only on the magnitude of the forcing but also the cross-equatorial ocean heat transport. In this study, we use Coupled Model Intercomparison (CMIP) output to determine the thermal forcings that result in hemispheric heating asymmetries and induce an ITCZ shift in the 21 st century. Using a fully coupled model we also determine the atmosphere will transport most of the total cross-equatorial heat transport if the thermal forcing is applied in the northern hemisphere...|$|R

500|$|As {{part of the}} <b>Hadley</b> <b>cell</b> circulation, surface {{air flows}} toward the equator while the flow aloft is towards the poles. A {{low-pressure}} area of calm, light variable winds near the equator {{is known as the}} doldrums, near-equatorial trough, intertropical front, or the Intertropical Convergence Zone. [...] When located within a monsoon region, this zone of low pressure and wind convergence is also known as the monsoon trough. [...] Around 30° in both hemispheres, air begins to descend toward the surface in subtropical high-pressure belts known as subtropical ridges. The subsident (sinking) air is relatively dry because as it descends, the temperature increases, but the absolute humidity remains constant, which lowers the relative humidity of the air mass. This warm, dry air is known as a superior air mass and normally resides above a maritime tropical (warm and moist) air mass. An increase of temperature with height is known as a temperature inversion. When it occurs within a trade wind regime, it is known as a trade wind inversion.|$|E
500|$|The {{subtropical}} ridge, {{also known}} as the subtropical high or horse latitudes, is a significant belt of atmospheric high pressure situated around the latitudes of 30°N in the Northern Hemisphere and 30°S in the Southern Hemisphere. It is the product of the global air circulation cell known as the <b>Hadley</b> <b>Cell.</b> The subtropical ridge is characterized by mostly calm winds, which act to reduce air quality under its axis by causing fog overnight, and haze during daylight hours {{as a result of the}} stable atmosphere found near its location. The air descending from the upper troposphere flows out from its center at surface level toward the upper and lower latitudes of each hemisphere, creating both the trade winds and the westerlies. The subtropical ridge moves poleward during the summer, reaching its most northern latitude in early fall, before moving equatorward during the cold season. The El Niño southern climate oscillation (ENSO) can displace the northern hemisphere subtropical ridge, with La Niñas allowing for a more northerly axis for the ridge, while El Niños show flatter, more southerly ridges. [...] The change of the ridge position during ENSO cycles changes the tracks of tropical cyclones that form around their equatorward and western peripheries. As the subtropical ridge varies in position and strength, it can enhance or depress monsoon regimes around their low-latitude periphery. The term [...] "horse latitudes" [...] refers to and is synonymous with the subtropical ridge or subtropical high.|$|E
