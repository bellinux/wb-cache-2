This paper attempts to address this issue using a platform-independent digital watermarking scheme applicable to a variety of VM images. The scheme embeds a watermark in the form of files in a VM image; the watermarked VM image is identified based on the <b>embedded</b> <b>files.</b> To reduce the possibility of discovery by an attacker, the names of the <b>embedded</b> <b>files</b> are very similar to the names of pre-existing files in the VM image. Experiments indicate that the approach is fast and accurate, with average turnaround times of 24. 001 seconds and 7. 549 seconds for watermark generation and detection, respectively...|$|R

50|$|However {{alternatives}} to the Nokia Audio Manager did exist, such as Nokryptia, a cross-platform command line tool distributed as source code which by exploiting a special case of the Lockstream <b>Embedded</b> <b>file</b> format could convert MP3 audio files almost instantly to the 5510 playable Lockstream Embedded format. Nokryptia worked by prefixing the MP3 file with a special header that then allowed the MP3 to follow unencrypted (the tool also supported the reverse, removing the header to restore the original MP3 file, however this was only possible on files encoded by the technique and the tool could not restore a file encoded by the Nokia Audio Manager).|$|E

Downloaders, seeders, and public photo trackers, if caught distributing illegal files, are protected from legal prosecution, because they can always use plausible deniability, saying that they {{knew nothing about the}} illicit file in the images.

With the progress of hardware of embedded systems, the gap of speed between main memory and CPU is becoming larger and larger.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>embedded</b> <b>file</b> {{system is}} an {{important}} part of embedded operating system. Due to the particularity of embedded devices storage medium, the instability of power supply and the security of mobile storage, the <b>embedded</b> <b>file</b> system has increasingly obvious importance in the embedded operating system. Based on the analysis of the realization plan of traditional Li ~ file system and several current popular <b>embedded</b> <b>file</b> systems, the paper proposed the realization plan of embedded Linux file system. The paper took the IntelDBPXA 250 experiment and development platform as the hardware platform. The main part of the paper described the realization of one embedded Linux operating system on the hardware platform, and laid the background for later file system realization. Then, this paper analyzed the design logic of the three levels, VFS, JFFSZ and MTD, and proposed the overall design frame of <b>embedded</b> <b>file</b> system. Afterwards, the paper desc ribed the practice details of Flash file system based on MTD equipment in embedded Linux. Considering the limitation of embedded devices storage space, on the basis of the embedded Linux file system, the paper simplified the corresponding virtual file systems and physical file systems that construct the file system, and made them more satisfactory to the requirement of embedded equipment...|$|E

40|$|One {{role for}} {{workload}} generation is {{as a means}} for understanding how servers and networks respond to variation in load. This enables management and capacity planning based on current and projected usage. This paper applies a number of observations of Web serve 1 usage to create a realistic Web workload generation tool which mimics a set of real users accessing a server. The tool, called SURGE (Scalable URL Reference Generator) generates references matching empirical measurements of 1) server file size distribution; 2) request size distribution; 3) relative file popularity; 4) <b>embedded</b> <b>file</b> references; 5) temporal locality of reference; and 6) idle pcriods of individual users. This paper reviews the essential elements required in the generation of a representative Web workload. It also addresses the technical challenges to satisfying this large set of simultaneous constraints on the properties of the reference stream, the solutions we adopted, and their associated accuracy. Finally, we present evidence that SURGE exercises servers in a manner significantly different from other Web server benchmarks. 1...|$|E

To best preserve the data on the phone it is necessary to isolate the phone from surrounding networks, which may not always be possible. Cellular phones employ many internal, removable and online data storage capabilities.

40|$|This example {{illustrates}} fitting Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) {{models to}} zero-inflated count data with the experimental MCMC procedure. ZIP models {{are often used}} when count data show an excess number of zeros, which in turn causes overdispersion. Consider survey data collected at a state park concerning the number of fish that visitors had caught {{in the last six}} months. People from two different populations provided information: those who attended the park and fished, and those who attended the park and did not fish. Zero fish caught has a different meaning for the two populations. The SAS source code for this example is available as an attachment in text file.

Analysis Count data frequently display overdispersion and excess zeros, which motivates zero-inflated count models (Lambert 1992; Greene 1994). Zero-inflated count models offer a way of modeling the excess zeros in addition to allowing for overdispersion in a standard parametric model. Zero inflation arises when one mechanism generates only zeros and the other process generates both zero an...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} effects on quality in audio steganography. Steganography is {{the science of}} hiding information, {{which is used to}} hiding the data from third party. Audio Steganography is a {{technique}} used to transmit hidden information by modifying an audio signal in an imperceptible manner. Embedding information into audio steganography is more secure due to less steganalysis techniques for attacking to audio. Least significant bit (LSB) coding is the simplest way to embed information in a digital audio file. By substituting the least significant bit of each sampling point with a binary message, LSB coding allows for a large amount of data to be encoded. Listening test and SNR will be carry out to test the quality between original file and <b>embedded</b> <b>file.</b> The payload can affect the quality of sound. Thus, it can said that LSB method can embed high payload of hidden message compare to other methods. Besides, different LSB position can also affect the quality of audio. The experimental result of this research is that the secret message can be hidden up to LSB position 3 to maintain imperceptible for the audio sound...|$|E
