[...] The foundation planned for a large Guggenheim museum on the waterfront in lower Manhattan, and it engaged Frank Gehry as the architect. [...] His essentially complete designs for the building were showcased in 2001 at the Fifth Avenue museum, but these plans were disrupted by the economic downturn of the early 2000s and the September 11, 2001 attacks, which prompted reconsideration of any plans in lower Manhattan.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if commercially produced <b>art</b> and aesthetic <b>education</b> packages are quality products and if <b>art</b> and aesthetic <b>education</b> packages meet selected goals <b>for</b> <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> This study was limited to packages developed for preschool, kindergarten, and elementary children. To initiate the study, various avenues were explored in order to discover sources of commercially produced <b>art</b> and aesthetic <b>education</b> packages. A list of 72 publishers and suppliers of <b>art</b> and aesthetic <b>education</b> packages was compiled. From this list, a sample of 14 packages was selected. The first portion of the study pertained to the individual analysis of each package. To assess the packages comprising the sample, "An Instrument for the Assessment of Instructional Materials," developed by Maurice Eash (1972) was selected as the evaluation instrument. This instrument is divided into five sections: (a) objectives, (b) organization of material, (c) methodology, (d) evaluation, and (e) overall assessment. The second portion of the study pertained to the relationship of the package to the goals <b>for</b> <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> Various <b>art</b> educators have listed goals <b>for</b> <b>art</b> education; moreover, the goals listed by the National <b>Art</b> <b>Education</b> Commission on <b>Art</b> <b>Education</b> (1977) were selected as the goals to be used in this study. A group of trained evaluators assessed the individual packages. The findings revealed that only two packages received mean and median scores of 5. 0 or higher on a rating scale of 1 through 7. This included the assessment of all five areas included in the evaluation instrument. The other 12 packages received mean and median scores of 2. 5 or less on a rating scale of 1 through 7. In comparing the. packages to the goals <b>for</b> <b>art</b> <b>education,</b> two packages met all of the goals <b>for</b> <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> These two packages were the same ones which received the highest ratings on the evaluation instrument. Two other packages met two of the goals <b>for</b> <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> All of the other packages met only one of the goals <b>for</b> <b>art</b> <b>education.</b> The majority of the packages met one of two goals, either "art education as a means of developing creative and flexible forms of thinking" or "art education as a means of helping students understand and appreciate art.

Students from eight schools around the country participated in the show which featured musical theatre, spoken word and interpretative dance. President Barack Obama made a surprise appearance at the event. Smith adopted a school in Greenfield, California also lobbied Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner for increased funding <b>for</b> <b>arts</b> <b>education</b> and that it is a personal issue for him. Smith said [...] "I didn't give a shit about science, math or English when I was in school and music was the only reason I wanted to go. It got me interested in other subjects and I would've never graduated without it. If kids can connect with some sort of art in some way, it will enrich their lives in ways they probably can't fully comprehend at the time." [...] Earlier in the week, Smith was joined by former New York Yankee and musician, Bernie Williams at Savoy Elementary School in Washington, D.C. where together they taught a music class. [...] "These are schools where the kids look down at their feet and have no hope and don't feel like they mean anything. They have no self-worth. They need something. This is not a photo-op and just throwing some money. You really roll your sleeves up and immerse yourself in the school." [...] Smith said.|$|E
