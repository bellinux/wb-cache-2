50|$|The masked <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> is {{considered}} a delicacy and is hunted and farm raised. In 2003, the coronavirus that caused the SARS epidemic was traced to masked <b>palm</b> <b>civets.</b> Several larger civets such as the large-spotted civet, Malayan civet and large Indian civet are also hunted and trapped for their meat. The small Indian civet is trapped and farm raised to harvest musk, {{which is used to}} make perfume and traditional Chinese medicine. Other civets species include the Asian <b>palm</b> <b>civet,</b> small-toothed <b>palm</b> <b>civet,</b> and Owston's <b>palm</b> <b>civet.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kopi is the Indonesian {{word for}} coffee.

50|$|The small-toothed <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> (Arctogalidia trivirgata), {{also known}} as the three-striped <b>palm</b> <b>civet,</b> is a <b>palm</b> <b>civet.</b> It lives in dense forests of {{southeast}} Asia, from the Assam district of India to Indochina and the Malay Peninsula and on Sumatra, Bangka, Java, Borneo, and numerous small nearby islands of Indonesia.|$|R

All 6 <b>palm</b> <b>civets</b> at the restaurant were positive for SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Partial spike (S) gene sequences of SARS-CoV from the 2 patients were identical to 4 of 5 Sgene viral sequences from <b>palm</b> <b>civets.</b> Phylogenetic analysis showed that SARS-CoV from <b>palm</b> <b>civets</b> in the restaurant was most closely related to animal isolates.

40|$|Information {{is scarce}} about sylvatic rabies virus in Asia and about rabies in <b>palm</b> <b>civets.</b> We report a novel sylvatic rabies virus variant {{detected}} in a golden <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> in Sri Lanka. Evolutionary analysis suggests the virus diverged from canine rabies viruses in Sri Lanka in ≈ 1933 (range 1886 – 1963). Rabies has been eliminated from domestic animals in industrialized countries, but sylvatic rabies remains an endemic disease. The ecology of rabies in wildlife populations and natural ecosystems is poorly understood (1), and, as a result, eliminating rabies {{from the wild}} is difficult. Little is known about sylvatic rabies in developing countries, where rabies takes its biggest toll on humans. Rabies is endemic to Sri Lanka and has been identified in different wild animals. However, all documented cases of rabies in wildlife in Sri Lanka have been considered a consequence of spillover from dogs. Rabies viruses circulating {{in this country are}} distinctly highly homogeneous (2, 3). Two species of <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> are commonly found in Sri Lanka: the common <b>palm</b> <b>civet,</b> Paradoxurus hermaphroditus, which is widespread in southern Asia and Southeast Asia, and the golden <b>palm</b> <b>civet,</b> P. zeylonensis, which is indigenous to Sri Lanka. This species is closely related to the brown <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> (P. jerdoni), which lives only in southern India (4). Moreover, 3 additional new species have been identified in Sri Lanka: the golden wetzone <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> (P. aureus), the golden dry-zone <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> (P. stenocephalus), and the Sri Lankan brown palm cive...|$|R
