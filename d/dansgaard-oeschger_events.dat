5|$|Freshwater {{addition}} {{has been}} implicated by coupled ocean and atmosphere climate modeling (Ganopolski and Rahmstorf 2001), showing that both Heinrich and <b>Dansgaard-Oeschger</b> <b>events</b> may show hysteresis behaviour. This means that relatively minor changes in freshwater loading into the Nordic Seas, {{such as a}} 0.15 Sv increase or 0.03 Sv decrease, would suffice to cause profound shifts in global circulation (Rahmstorf et al. 2005). The results show that a Heinrich event does not cause a cooling around Greenland but further south, mostly in the subtropical Atlantic, a finding supported by most available paleoclimatic data. This idea was connected to D-O events by Maslin et al. (2001). They suggested that each ice sheet had its own conditions of stability, but that on melting, the influx of freshwater was enough to reconfigure ocean currents, and cause melting elsewhere. More specifically, D-O cold events, and their associated influx of meltwater, reduce {{the strength of the}} North Atlantic Deep Water current (NADW), weakening the northern-hemisphere circulation and therefore resulting in an increased transfer of heat polewards in the southern hemisphere. This warmer water results in melting of Antarctic ice, thereby reducing density stratification and the strength of the Antarctic Bottom Water current (AABW). This allows the NADW to return to its previous strength, driving northern hemisphere melting and another D-O cold event. Eventually, the accumulation of melting reaches a threshold, whereby it raises sea level enough to undercut the Laurentide ice sheet, thereby causing a Heinrich event and resetting the cycle.|$|E

25|$|An abrupt {{climate change}} {{occurs when the}} climate system is forced to {{transition}} to a new climate state {{at a rate that}} is determined by the climate system energy-balance, and which is more rapid than the rate of change of the external forcing.

500|$|Past studies {{proposed}} {{that changes in}} dire wolf body size correlated with climate fluctuations. A later study compared dire wolf craniodental morphology from four LaBrea pits, each representing four different time periods. The results are evidence {{of a change in}} dire wolf size, dental wear and breakage, skull shape, and snout shape across time. Dire wolf body size had decreased between the start of the Last Glacial Maximum and near its ending at the warm Allerød oscillation. Evidence of food stress (food scarcity leading to lower nutrient intake) is seen in smaller body size, skulls with a larger cranial base and shorter snout (shape neoteny and size neoteny), and more tooth breakage and wear. Dire wolves dated 17,900YBP showed all of these features, which indicates food stress. Dire wolves dated 28,000YBP also showed to a degree many of these features but were the largest wolves studied, and it was {{proposed that}} these wolves were also suffering from food stress and that wolves earlier than this date were even bigger in size. Nutrient stress is likely to lead to stronger bite forces to more fully consume carcasses and to crack bones, and with changes to skull shape to improve mechanical advantage. North American climate records reveal cyclic fluctuations during the glacial period that included rapid warming followed by gradual cooling, called <b>Dansgaard–Oeschger</b> <b>events.</b> These cycles would have caused increased temperature and aridity, and at LaBrea would have caused ecological stress and therefore food stress. A similar trend was found with the gray wolf, which in the Santa Barbara basin was originally massive, robust, and possibly convergent with the dire wolf, but was replaced by more gracile forms by the start of the Holocene.|$|E

40|$|A {{high-resolution}} {{record of}} organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst production in Guaymas Basin, Gulf of California (Mexico) reveals a complex paleoceanographic history {{over the last}} ~ 40 ka. Guaymas Basin is an excellent location to perform high resolution studies of changes in late Quaternary climate and paleo-productivity because it is characterized by high primary productivity, high sedimentation rates, and low oxygen bottom waters. These factors contribute to the deposition and preservation of laminated sediments throughout large portions of the core MD 02 - 2515. In this study, we document dinoflagellate cyst production at a centennial to millennial scale throughout the late Quaternary. Based on the cyst assemblages, three dinoflagellate cyst zones were established and roughly correspond to Marine Isotope Stages (MISs) 1 to 3. MISs 1 and 3 are dominated by cysts of heterotrophic dinoflagellates, whereas MIS 2 is characterized by enhanced variability and {{a greater proportion of}} cysts produced by autotrophic taxa. The most dominant dinoflagellate cyst taxa found throughout the core were Brigantedinium spp. And Operculodinium centrocarpum. <b>Dansgaard-Oeschger</b> <b>event</b> 8 is observed in the dinoflagellate cyst record where it is characterized by an increase in warm taxa, such as Spiniferites pachydermus. Other intervals of interest are the Younger Dryas where warmer conditions are recorded and the Holocene which is characterized by the consistent presence of tropical species Stelladinium reidii, Tuberculodinidum vancampoae, Bitectatodinium spongium, and an increase in Quinquecuspis concreta.

40|$|The ice core record reveals large {{variations}} in the concentration of atmospheric methane, [CH 4], over the last 800 kyr. Amongst the most striking natural features are the large, rapid rises in [CH 4], of 100 – 200 ppbv, on timescales of less than 100 years, {{at the beginning of}} Dansgaard- Oeschger (D-O) events during the last glacial period (21 – 110 kyr before present). Despite the potential insight they could offer into the likelihood of future rapid rises in [CH 4], the relative roles of changes in methane sources and sinks during D-O events have been little explored. Here, we use a global atmospheric chemistry-transport model to explore—for the first time, in a process-based fashion— controls on the oxidizing capacity during an idealized D-O event that features a characteristically rapid rise in [CH 4]. We find that the two controls previously identified in the literature as having had significant (though opposing) influences on the oxidizing capacity between glacial and interglacial periods—changes in air temperature and emissions of nonmethane volatile organic compounds from vegetation—offset one another between idealized Heinrich stadial and Greenland interstadial states. The result is, the net change in oxidizing capacity is very small, implying the rapid rises in [CH 4] at the beginning of D-O events were almost entirely source-driven. This poses a challenge to earthsystem models—to generate a sufficiently large increase in methane emissions in response to a simulated D-O event, via a more realistic freshwater forcing impacting the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation or, possibly, other climate-change mechanisms.

Methane concentration changes were measured over the <b>Dansgaard–Oeschger</b> <b>event</b> 17 (DO- 17, [*]∼[*]  60   000  yr BP) in the Antarctic Vostok 4 G- 2 ice core. Measurements were performed using continuous-flow analysis combined with laser spectroscopy. The results highlight many anomalous layers at the centimeter scale that are unevenly distributed along the ice core. The anomalous methane mixing ratios differ from those in the immediate surrounding layers by up to 50  ppbv. This phenomenon can be theoretically reproduced by a simple layered trapping model, creating very localized gas age scale inversions. We propose a method for cleaning the record of anomalous values that aims at minimizing the bias in the overall signal. Once the layered-trapping-induced anomalies are removed from the record, DO- 17 appears to be smoother than its equivalent record from the high-accumulation WAIS Divide ice core. This is expected due to the slower sinking and densification speeds of firn layers at lower accumulation. However, the degree of smoothing appears surprisingly similar between modern and DO- 17 conditions at Vostok. This suggests that glacial records of trace gases from low-accumulation sites in the East Antarctic plateau can provide a better time resolution of past atmospheric composition changes than previously expected. We also developed a numerical method to extract the gas age distributions in ice layers after the removal of the anomalous layers based on comparison with a weakly smoothed record. It is particularly adapted for the conditions of the East Antarctic plateau, as it helps to characterize smoothing for a large range of very low-temperature and low-accumulation conditions...|$|R
