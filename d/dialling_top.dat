50|$|Previous {{screw mount}} Leicas used two {{separate}} shutter speed dials for slow and fast speeds (the fast speed <b>dial</b> on <b>top</b> {{of the camera}} rotated during firing). The M3 combined slower and faster speeds and the dial does not rotate during firing. Supposedly, this reduces vibrations in the camera. Early models used a non-geometrical series of shutter speeds. On later models this became the international standard of 1s to 1/1000s.|$|R

2500|$|The early Minox cameras from Riga to Minox B, BL and AX, were {{equipped}} with a mechanical shutter, while later model Minox ( [...] C, LX, EC, TLX [...] ) cameras have an electromagnetic shutter. When closed, the viewfinder and lens windows are protected. Complan lens and Minox lens are unit focusing lens, focusing from 8 inches (20cm) to infinity through precision gear linked to a focusing <b>dial</b> on <b>top</b> of the camera. All Minox cameras, except the EC and MX, have a parallax correction viewfinder: when the focusing dial moves, the viewfinder moves in tandem to correct for parallax.|$|R
5000|$|Video Pinball allows 7 games -- 4 pinball variations, a {{basketball}} game, and {{two versions of}} Breakout (Breakout and a variant called Break Away) -- for one to two players. The unit provides digital on-screen scoring, automatic serves, and color graphics. Video Pinball uses a micro-controller and {{a small amount of}} RAM rather than the [...] "Pong on a chip" [...] IC's that had been used in the slew of pong machines Atari Inc. had been releasing. Pinball was played primarily with the side bumper buttons, and Breakout and Basketball with the <b>dial</b> and <b>top</b> buttons.|$|R
50|$|Presented in 2011, the GMT is {{the first}} Greubel Forsey {{timepiece}} to feature a complication other than a tourbillon. It displays second time zone at 10 o’clock and world by a rotating, three-dimensional globe at 8 o’clock. The position of the continents on the titanium globe are cross-referenced with the 24-hour chapter ring circling it for an approximate indication of time all over the world. Other indications include an hour-minute dial at 1 o’clock; a small seconds <b>dial</b> on <b>top</b> of that at 3 o’clock and at 4 o’clock a sectorial power reserve indicator. The movement was especially developed for this timepiece and features the 25° inclined Tourbillon 24 Secondes cage.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the mission, {{or early}} on in flight, bomb data was entered on two {{settings}} <b>dials</b> on the <b>top</b> of the range unit. These set the trail scale and bomb class letter, estimating the amount the bomb would slow in forward motion (trail) and how quickly it would reach the ground due {{to the effects of}} terminal velocity (class). Once set, these settings could be ignored.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to Comical Radio Classic, two shows {{have been added}} to the schedule. [...] "Too Much Information with Dan and Dan" [...] features Dan Naturman, Justy Dodge and Danny Lobell as they entertain guests from entertainment and comedy. Past guests have included Alison Arngrim (Nelly Olson from Little House on the Prairie) and Jim Davis (Garfield). The show involves comedy segments like <b>dial</b> a Madoff, <b>Top</b> ten TV theme songs, and prank calls.|$|R

Another band runs through Saint Valentines Peak, Loyetea, Gunns Plains to the <b>Dial</b> Range. On <b>top</b> of this is sandstone, a dolerite sill, and basalts altered to chlorite and hematite. These units are called the Roland Conglomerate and Moina Sandstone and represent contrasting stratigraphic architecture to that observed in western Tasmania, a reflection of evolution of different rift depocentres.|$|R
5000|$|The WMEE calls {{originated}} in 1971 at 1380 kHz on the AM <b>dial</b> as a <b>Top</b> 40 outlet before switching to 97.3 FM in 1979. 97.3 FM had previously programmed beautiful music as WMEF (and originally as WKJG-FM). The station's on-air handles {{over the years}} have included [...] "WMEE, The New Magic 97 FM" [...] (the first name used when WMEE moved from AM to FM in 1979), [...] "All Hit Power 97 FM, WMEE" [...] and [...] "Mix 97.3".|$|R

The two <b>top</b> <b>dials</b> on the left column show the number of solar and lunar eclipses in the current year. The two dials on the right column show the leap years and leap centuries. The hand on the leap century dial moved {{for the first time}} in 2000; it will move for the second time in 2400.|$|R
50|$|In {{the most}} {{expensive}} tall clock units, the mahogany cases had a mid-18th century English style and, bearing exactly similar English brass mechanisms all, their case complexity determined their final price. Distinctively for Willard's workshop, above the clock's top fretwork, three pedestals were, on which two spherical finials and a large bird figure were mounted. In addition, like Aaron, Simon built a glass <b>dial</b> door, whose <b>top</b> had a half arch shape. Onto the dial, celebrated Boston painters painted different motifs. Also, with few extra mechanism, amusing wheels with animated figures were featured on the dial, enticing the customer interest effectively.|$|R
5000|$|WCLY began {{broadcasting}} in August 1962 as WNOH as {{a country}} station founded by N.O. Harris, owner of Harris Wholesale, a local beer distributor. WNOH's original antenna was close to where present-day Interstate 40 crosses Lake Wheeler Road, and its studios were located in the Jack Wardlaw Building on Hillsborough Street. WNOH switched to Top 40 as WYNA in 1966, only to return to country under former WKIX owner Hugh Holder. As country music began taking root on the FM <b>dial,</b> WYNA became <b>Top</b> 40 again as WRZR [...] "The Rock of Raleigh" [...] in 1982.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1989 {{the band}} went to Hollywood {{to record their}} debut album with {{producer}} Bill Wray. Songs from the 1988 recording session including [...] "Ride the Whip" [...] and [...] "Only Young Once" [...] {{made it to the}} new album. Trixter was released in May 1990 with the song [...] "Line of Fire" [...] as the single for rock radio. The song slowly climbed the charts, reaching No. 1 on Z-Rocks Top 100 by July 1990. Along with the release of the album, Trixter also filmed their first video for the song [...] "Give It to Me Good". In September the band headed out on a nationwide tour and after two weeks they landed the opening slot for Stryper. In mid-October Trixter joined Don Dokken for another tour around the USA. It was on this tour that MTV added the video for [...] "Give It to Me Good". Within one week the video was No. 1 on the <b>Dial</b> MTV <b>top</b> ten video countdown. The video stayed No. 1 for five weeks straight.|$|R
5000|$|The {{only real}} {{difference}} to the engine bay was the air cleaner mounted {{on top of the}} engine. The interior was almost identical to a GT. The Mk2 did exactly what Ford wanted, it was far more reliable whilst still quick enough to be used in competition, until it was replaced by the Escort Twin Cam. The car did receive a few updates, but none as urgent as the Mk1's. Only a few months after production started, the Lotus badge on the rear panel was cancelled and a new TWIN CAM badge was fitted under the Cortina script on the boot lid. Despite the badge changes, Ford UK continued to market the model as the [...] "Cortina Lotus". [...] The new combined clock and centre console was fitted. In late 1968 the entire Mk2 range received some cosmetic changes; for the Lotus, this meant that the 4 <b>dials</b> on <b>top</b> of the dash were brought down and made part of the dash. An internal bonnet release and a more conventional mounting for the handbrake were also phased in. A new single-rail gearshift mechanism was used. The car stayed in production until 1970.|$|R
25|$|Several other {{buildings}} {{within the park}} are listed at grade II. The oldest of these is an icehouse with a circular brick-lined underground chamber which probably dates from the late 18th century. Several structures that are now listed date from the 1861–2 works to the grounds. The Jacobean-style gate lodge on Chester Road is in red brick with stone dressings and blue brick decoration. The clock tower over the carriage house features stone frames to the clock <b>dials</b> and is <b>topped</b> by a wooden finial with a weather vane. A large iron statue of a mastiff with puppies oversetting a food bowl stands in the forecourt of the hall; it is attributed to Pierre Louis Rouillard and came from the Paris Exhibition of 1855.|$|R

50|$|The Canon FP is a 35 mm SLR {{introduced}} by Canon Inc. of Japan in October 1964, {{using the new}} Canon FL lens mount.The FP and FX were virtually the same camera, but the lower priced FP did not have built in metering. At the time, many photographers preferred using a handheld meter, and others preferred the lower pricing. However, the FP was not popular making it more rare and desirable for collectors. Canon sold an external light meter with the same specifications as the built-in meter on the FX. The shutter is a horizontally traveling focal plane shutter supporting speeds between 1/1000 and 1 second in full stop increments, selected by a <b>dial</b> on the <b>top</b> plate on the photographer's right. The X-sync speed for flash is 1/55 sec.; flash support was through a PC socket {{on the front of}} the body.|$|R
5000|$|The F-501 {{can be set}} {{for auto}} exposure, [...] "hi-speed" [...] auto exposure, [...] "dual" [...] auto-exposure (with AI-S type lenses) which {{switches}} between regular auto exposure and hi-speed autoexposure based on the lens attached, aperture priority, or full manual exposure modes, which allow the user to set both the aperture and shutter speeds. The shutter speed and auto-exposure modes are set {{by the use of}} a <b>dial</b> on the <b>top</b> of the camera, while the aperture ring on the lens is used for aperture control. The [...] "hi-speed" [...] auto-exposure tends to favor higher shutter speeds and wider aperture settings than the [...] "normal" [...] auto exposure mode, while the [...] "dual" [...] mode offers [...] "normal" [...] auto-exposure with lenses at focal lengths less than 135 mm and [...] "hi-speed" [...] auto-exposure if a lens is longer than 135 mm.|$|R
5000|$|The Setright [...] "Speed" [...] {{model can}} print any value {{within the range}} for which it has been {{designed}} and can easily deal with changes in fares. A set of concentric <b>dials</b> on the <b>top</b> is used to set the value and levers can set different fares (such as [...] "Adult" [...] or [...] "Child") and other vital information (such as [...] "Inbound" [...] or [...] "Outbound"). The machine is entirely manually powered and requires no external power or batteries, although electric power packs are available for use in one-person operated buses. To print a ticket, the operator releases a small trigger {{on the base of}} the case and rotates the crank handle by one turn for each ticket. These actions are easily carried out with one hand. Multiple tickets are quickly printed by simply turning the crank once for each.|$|R
50|$|The Nikkorex 35 was {{the first}} model of the Nikkorex series, {{produced}} in 1960. Several key differences between the F model and the Nikkorex model helped keep the price low: the Nikkorex incorporated a selenium-cell meter mounted behind a honeycomb lens {{on the front of}} the camera rather than through-the-lens metering (as in the Nikon Photomic prism) and used a leaf shutter rather than the more expensive focal-plane shutter found in the Nikon F and similar higher-end SLRs. The Citizen MVL shutter had speeds from 1 second to 1/500th second that were set by a ring on the lens, rather than by the more conventional method of a <b>dial</b> on the <b>top</b> of the body of the camera. The ISO (film speed) was also set by a nontraditional lens ring. The lens itself was a fixed four-element Nikkor-Q 50mm 2.5, the limited nature of which was somewhat supplemented by two screw-on accessory lenses, a 35mm wide-angle and a 90mm telephoto, both 5.6.|$|R
2500|$|A grade-II*-listed gateway now {{situated}} in the wall {{to the west of}} the hall formerly belonged to Sir Roger Wilbraham's almshouses in Nantwich. The wrought-iron gate features a sun motif with scrolls; it stands in a moulded stone opening flanked by niches containing busts and surmounted by lions. Several other buildings within the park are also listed at grade II. The oldest of these is an icehouse with a circular underground chamber lined with red brick which probably dates from the late 18th century. [...] The reconstruction of the grounds in 1861–2 also resulted in several structures that are now listed. The Jacobean-style gate lodge on Chester Road is in red brick with stone dressings and blue brick decoration. The clock tower over the carriage house features stone frames to the clock <b>dials</b> and is <b>topped</b> by a wooden finial with a weather vane.

50|$|Each 8-track tape {{contained}} four game programs, and {{the system}} featured a channel selector <b>dial</b> on the <b>top</b> to chose which program to play. After inserting a tape and adjusting volume via a slider on top next to the channel selector, each player participating would need to press enter. Subsequently, players would be asked questions played back from the tape. Players would then be asked to answer {{as quickly as possible}} (indicated by dashes on the display), by selecting the correct colour, number, or spelling out a word and pressing Enter. Players were then awarded typically between 1 and 4 points, with typically the first player receiving an additional point for answering first. The Jeopardy cartridge varied from this scoring system, following {{along the lines of the}} Jeopardy scoring system from the first rounds of a game. After all players answered, the correct answer would be revealed and the points on the displays updated. At the end of the game the winning player would be indicated. Occasional music interludes (such as in the Password Plus game) would occur while the tape played to the correct location to continue gameplay. Occasionally the display of the player with the leading score would also flash.|$|R
