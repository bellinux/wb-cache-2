25|$|Joseph Lister is {{credited}} {{for being the}} first to use a tourniquet device to create a bloodless surgical field in 1864. He also recommended exsanguinations prior to tourniquet application by limb elevation. In 1873, Friedrich von Esmarch developed a rubber bandage that would both control bleeding and exsanguinate. This device is known as Esmarch's bandage for surgical haemostasis or Eschmarch's Tourniquet. At the time this device was superior to Petit’s device because Petit’s cloth bandages tore, the screw could untwist, and pressures that were very high, unknown and uneven were applied to the underlying limb, resulting in hazards and injuries. In 1881, Richard von Volkmann showed that limb paralysis can occur from the use of the <b>Esmarch</b> <b>tourniquet.</b> Many cases of serious and permanent limb paralysis were reported from the use of non-pneumatic Esmarch tourniquets.|$|E
2500|$|In view {{of reports}} of serious {{injuries}} and limb paralysis with non-pneumatic tourniquets, in 1904, Harvey Cushing created a pneumatic tourniquet. [...] This type of tourniquet compressed the underlying blood vessels using a compressed gas source to inflate a cylindrical bladder. [...] This {{was superior to}} the <b>Esmarch</b> <b>tourniquet</b> in two ways: (1) the tourniquet could be applied and removed quickly; and (2) this method of limb occlusion decreased the incidence of nerve paralysis.|$|E

5000|$|Esmarch bandage (also {{known as}} Esmarch's bandage for {{surgical}} haemostasis or <b>Esmarch's</b> <b>tourniquet)</b> in its modern form is a narrow (5 to 10 cm wide) soft rubber bandage {{that is used}} to expel venous blood from a limb (exsanguinate) that has had its arterial supply cut off by a tourniquet. The limb is often elevated as the elastic pressure is applied.The exsanguination is necessary to enable some types of delicate reconstructive surgery where bleeding would obscure the working area. A bloodless area is also required to introduce local anaesthetic agents for a regional nerve block. This method was first described by Augustus Bier in 1908.((Translated and reprinted in Survey of Anesthesiology1967,11, 293-) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT:We {{performed}} a prospective randomized clinical {{study to determine}} whether use of a thigh tour niquet influences the incidence of deep venous throm bosis. The lower limbs of patients who were scheduled for elective surgery on the fore part of the foot were ran domized and {{assigned to one of}} three treatment catego ries: Group I, no tourniquet; Group II, exsanguination by an <b>Esmarch</b> bandage before <b>tourniquet</b> application; and Group HI, exsanguination by elevation of the ex tremity prior to application of a tourniquet. The 117 limbs of seventy-one patients included in this study were evaluated preoperatively and twenty-four and seventy-two hours postoperatively with 125 I-labeled fibrinogen, and preoperatively and seventy-two hours postopera tively with Doppler ultrasound studies and phleborheog...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of fatal {{pulmonary}} embolism (PE) following exsanguinations of lower limb in orthopedic surgery. A 30 -year-old man was posted for fixation of a tibial plateau fracture on the seventh day after injury. Subarchnoid block was performed. Esmarch bandage was used for exsanguination of the limb and tourniquet was inflated. Within three minutes after tourniquet inflation, the patient became unconscious hypotensive, and collapsed. Resuscitation was instituted and spontaneous circulation restored. Right ventricular strain pattern on transthoracic echocardiography, increased levels of D-dimer, and Doppler examination of the lowerlimb confirmed deep venous thrombosis of right femoral vessels and PE. In spite of thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase and heparin, the patient died on the ninth day after the event. Cases of PE secondary {{to the use of}} <b>Esmarch</b> bandage and <b>tourniquet</b> are reviewed here to identify the risk groups and management of PE...|$|R

40|$|Friedrich von Esmarch {{was born}} in 1823 in Germany and {{he is one of}} the {{greatest}} surgeons of the Germany of that time. Fridrich von Esmarch introduced the <b>Esmarch</b> <b>tourniquet,</b> which enables operative field bloodless. This revolutionary innovation is still present in the orthopaedic surgery all around world, as well as for the first line hemostasis. Beside this, Esmarch also improves others fields of surgery: immobilizations, methods of antiseptic surgery, modified Esmarch mask for anesthesia. He joined few wars and had a rang surgeon-general. Although his experience was primary from the trauma, he also introduced the training courses of the First aid for the ordinary people, making medicine of that time more modern and efficient.

40|$|The {{use of an}} Esmarch bandage as a {{tourniquet}} {{in surgery}} has been criticized. Many authors claim that the pressures under the Esmarch are inconsistent and may be extremely high. We have seen few, if any, problems {{from the use of}} an Esmarch in surgery of the foot and ankle. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the pressures generated under the <b>Esmarch</b> <b>tourniquet</b> in a situation that mimics its clinical application, and to determine whether pres-sures of appropriate magnitude and consistency are ob-tained in order to recommend its continued use in surgery. Ten volunteers performed numerous applications of the Esmarch. The number of wraps and the width of the Esmarch bandage used were varied. The Esmarch was applied as it would be for a surgical case. Pressures directly beneath the Esmarch were recorded 8 cm proxi-mal to the distal tip of the medial malleolus. Considering all volunteers and all pressures generated, a 3 -in Esmarch applied with three wraps gave a mean pressure (fSD) of 225 2 46 mm Hg. A 3 -in Esmarch applied with four wraps gave a mean pressure of 291 2 53 mm Hg. A 4 -in Esmarch applied with three wraps gave a mean pressure of 233 f 35 mm Hg, and a 4 -in Esmarch with four wraps gave a mean pressure of 284 f 42 mm Hg. The maximum pressures generated by any individual were as follows: 3 -in three wraps, 321 mm Hg; 3 -in four wraps, 413 mm Hg; 4 -in three wraps, 328 mm Hg; and 4 -in four wraps, 380 mm Hg. There was no significant difference in the magnitude or consistency of pressures generated between the experienced and inexperienced wrappers. There did not appear to be a learning curve for the application of the Esmarch bandage. We conclude that an Esmarch bandage, used as a tourniquet, can generate safe and reliable pressures. Either a 3 -in or 4 -in Esmarch bandage applied above the ankle with three circumferential overlapping wraps con-sistently results in pressures that are in a safe range...|$|E
