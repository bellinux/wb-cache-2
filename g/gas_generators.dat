5|$|Nitrogen gas is an {{industrial}} gas {{produced by the}} fractional distillation of liquid air, or by mechanical means using gaseous air (pressurised reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption). Nitrogen <b>gas</b> <b>generators</b> using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered nitrogen. Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen). Commercial-grade nitrogen already contains at most 20ppm oxygen, and specially purified grades containing at most 2ppm oxygen and 10ppm argon are also available.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} December 1942 that the demand valve was {{developed}} to the form which gained widespread acceptance. This came about after French naval officer Jacques-Yves Cousteau and engineer Émile Gagnan {{met for the first}} time in Paris. Gagnan, employed at Air Liquide, had miniaturized and adapted a Rouquayrol-Denayrouze regulator used for <b>gas</b> <b>generators</b> following severe fuel restrictions due to the German occupation of France; Cousteau suggested it be adapted for diving, which in 1864 was its original purpose.|$|E
25|$|Word of his {{exploits}} {{got back}} to the President, who ordered General Winfield Scott to see to Lowe's formation of a balloon corps, with Lowe as Chief Aeronaut. It was almost four months before Lowe received orders and provisions to construct four (eventually seven) balloons equipped with mobile hydrogen <b>gas</b> <b>generators.</b> At the same time he assembled a band of men whom he would instruct in the methodology of military ballooning. The newly formed Union Army Balloon Corps remained a civilian contract organization, never receiving military commissions, a dangerous position lest any one of the men be captured as spies and summarily executed.|$|E
25|$|Lowe {{believed}} that balloons used {{for military purposes}} had to be better constructed than the common balloons used by civilian aeronauts. They also required special handling and care for use on the battlefield. At first the balloons of the day were inflated at municipal coke gas supply stations and were towed inflated by ground crews to the field. Lowe recognized {{the need for the}} development of portable hydrogen <b>gas</b> <b>generators,</b> by which the balloons could be filled in the field. Lowe had to deal with administrative officers who usually held ranks lower than major and had more interest in accounting than providing for a proper war effort. This caused delays in the funding of materials.|$|E

25|$|In 1942, {{during the}} German {{occupation}} of France, Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Émile Gagnan designed {{the first successful}} and safe open-circuit scuba, known as the Aqua-Lung. Their system combined an improved demand regulator with high-pressure air tanks. Émile Gagnan, an engineer employed by the Air Liquide company, miniaturized and adapted the regulator to use with <b>gas</b> <b>generators,</b> in response to constant fuel shortage that was a consequence of German requisitioning. Gagnan's boss, Henri Melchior, knew that his son-in-law Jacques-Yves Cousteau was looking for an automatic demand regulator to increase the useful period of the underwater breathing apparatus invented by Commander le Prieur, so he introduced Cousteau to Gagnan in December 1942. On Cousteau's initiative, the Gagnan's regulator was adapted to diving, and the new Cousteau-Gagnan patent was registered some weeks later in 1943.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, Percival Aircraft Company {{formed a}} {{helicopter}} division, and began design {{work on a}} medium-sized helicopter designated P.74. They designed the helicopter to meet Air Ministry Specification EH.125D issued in May 1952 for an experimental helicopter to test jet driven rotors. This experimental helicopter had a teardrop-shaped fuselage with a two-seat cockpit in the nose and a large cabin that ran {{the full length of}} the fuselage. Beneath the cabin floor, two Napier Oryx <b>gas</b> <b>generators</b> fed compressed air to the tips of the three rotor blades through triple ejector ducts. The rotor blades used ailerons on the trailing edges with pitch control achieved by a screw jack. The unusual engine location required that exhaust pipes pass through the cabin wall between the rows of seats. This created excessive noise and heat for intended passengers.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the lander}} was 355 m above the ground, airbags were {{inflated}} {{in less than}} a second using three catalytically cooled solid rocket motors that served as <b>gas</b> <b>generators.</b> The airbags were made of 4 inter-connected multi-layer vectran bags that surrounded the tetrahedron lander. They were designed and tested to accommodate grazing angle impacts as high as 28m/s. However, as the airbags were designed for no more than about 15m/s vertical impacts, three solid retrorockets were mounted above the lander in the backshell. These were fired at 98m above the ground. The lander's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0m/s between 15 and 25m above the ground. After 2.3 seconds, while the rockets were still firing, the lander cut the bridle loose about 21.5m above the ground and fell to the ground. The rockets flew up and away with the backshell and parachute (they have since been sighted by orbital images). The lander impacted at 14m/s and limited the impact to only 18G of deceleration. The first bounce was 15.7m high and continued bouncing for at least 15 additional bounces (accelerometer data recording did not continue through all of the bounces).|$|E

40|$|A {{rocket engine}} <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> {{component}} development test was recently {{conducted at the}} Marshall Space Flight Center. This <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> is intended to power a rocket engine turbopump by the combustion of Lox and RP- 1. The testing demonstrated design requirements for start sequence, wall compatibility, performance, and stable combustion. During testing the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> injector was modified to improve distribution of outer wall coolant and the igniter boss was modified to investigate {{the use of a}} pyrotechnic igniter. Expected chamber pressure oscillations at longitudinal acoustic mode were measured for three different chamber lengths tested. High amplitude discrete oscillations resulted in the chamber-alone configurations when chamber acoustic modes coupled with feed-system acoustics modes. For the full <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> configuration, which included a turbine inlet manifold, high amplitude oscillations occurred only at off-design very low power levels.

40|$|Testing of a {{powerpack}} configuration (turbomachinery and <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> assembly) and {{the first}} complete engine system of the liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen propellant J- 2 X rocket engine have been completed at the NASA Stennis Space Center. The combustion stability characteristics of the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> assemblies on these two systems are of interest for reporting since considerable effort was expended to eliminate combustion instability during early development of the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> assembly with workhorse hardware. Comparing the final workhorse <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> assembly development test data to the powerpack and engine system test data provides an opportunity to investigate how the nearly identical configurations of <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> assemblies operate with two very different propellant supply systems one the autonomous pressure-fed test configuration on the workhorse development test stand, the other the pump-fed configurations on the powerpack and engine systems. The development of the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> assembly {{and the elimination of}} the combustion instability on the pressure-fed workhorse test stand have been reported extensively in the two previous Liquid Propulsion Subcommittee meetings 1 - 7. The powerpack and engine system testing have been conducted from mid- 2011 through 2012. All tests of the powerpack and engine system <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> systems to date have been stable. However, measureable dynamic behavior, similar to that observed on the pressure-fed test stand and reported in Ref.
