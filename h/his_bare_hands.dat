5|$|The biblical account {{states that}} Samson was a Nazirite, {{and that he}} was given immense {{strength}} to aid him against his enemies and allow him to perform superhuman feats, including slaying a lion with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>hands</b> and massacring an entire army of Philistines using only the jawbone of an ass. However, if Samson's long hair was cut, then his Nazirite vow would be violated, and he would lose his strength.|$|E
5|$|Agent Fox Mulder {{arrives at}} the civic center after {{what looks like a}} massacre; bodies lie on the {{sidewalk}} and in the foyer. Sheriff Spencer (John Cygan) explains that the suspect murdered four people from the elevator with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>hands.</b> His rampage ended when he was shot by a security guard. Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months.

5|$|After infiltrating the Garden of Death and {{the castle}} where Blofeld spends his time {{dressed in the}} costume of a Samurai warrior, Bond is {{captured}} and Bunt identifies him as a British secret agent and not a Japanese coal miner. After surviving a near execution, Bond exacts revenge on Blofeld in a duel, Blofeld armed with a sword and Bond with a wooden staff. Bond eventually kills Blofeld by strangling him with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>hands</b> {{in a fit of}} violent rage, then blows up the castle. Upon escaping, he suffers a head injury, leaving him an amnesiac living as a Japanese fisherman with Kissy, {{while the rest of the}} world believes him dead; his obituary appears in the newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Drummond's wartime {{experience}} {{had given him}} a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—"he could move over ground without a single blade of grass rustling"—and the ability to incapacitate others—"he could kill a man with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>hands</b> in a second". During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man's land. Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player. In addition to Drummond's physical attributes is his common sense, which allows him to equal and beat his opponents, even if they have a superior intellect.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, Harada was {{reassigned to}} the {{aircraft}} carrier Hiyō. In early October of that year, the carrier departed Japan {{to take part in}} the Guadalcanal Campaign. On 17 October, Harada formed part of the escort for a force of torpedo bombers which were attempting to attack targets on Guadalcanal. American Grumman F4F Wildcats attacked this force, and while Harada probably downed a Wildcat, his aircraft was badly damaged. His plane crash-landed near the Japanese base at Rekata Bay on Santa Isabel Island, and Harada had to dig himself out from underneath the wreckage of his plane with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>hands.</b> Harada was later returned to Japan on board a hospital ship.|$|E

5|$|During this time, Zhou Tong {{also has}} an {{additional}} disciple named Wu Song. Wu Song becomes famous for killing a man-eating tiger with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>hands</b> and is appointed as a constable in his native Shandong. The county magistrate Sun Guoqin later sends Wu {{on a mission to}} Kaifeng with precious tiger bone balm in order to curry favor with influential personages. During his stay in the capital, he makes the acquaintance of Zhou. Zhou finds Wu to be a man of great strength, but feels that he lacks refinement in his martial technique and, therefore, offers guidance for Wu's training. Unfortunately, these two men only interact for a brief two months before Wu has to return home, never to see Zhou again.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, {{again at}} the {{invitation}} of the Prince of Wales, he joined HMS Serapis, which conducted the Prince on an official tour of India, 1875–76. Louis sketched some of the events of the tour and his drawings were published in the Illustrated London News. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 May 1876. The Prince asked Louis to stay with him at Marlborough House for the summer of 1876, but wishing to gain further experience at sea, Louis instead accepted an offer to join Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as a lieutenant on board HMS Sultan. In addition to acting as the Duke's equerry, Louis continued his naval duties. He did not enjoy the position, as the Duke was rather touchy and Louis's cabin was infested with rats, one of which he caught with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>hands</b> as it ran across his chest as he lay in bed. The Sultan toured the Mediterranean from July 1876.|$|E
5|$|The imprisoned {{architect}} Daedalus tells Kratos {{to unite}} the Labyrinth. Completing this task, Kratos fights {{his way through the}} aerial puzzle and rescues Pandora, who tells him to break the Chain of Balance so the Labyrinth can be raised, and she can reach her box. Neutralizing the three judges and breaking the chain, Kratos raises the Labyrinth, and Pandora tries to enter the Flame of Olympus. Zeus intervenes and fights Kratos; after a brief battle, Pandora sacrifices herself and quenches the flame, despite Kratos' protests. Finding Pandora's Box empty, Kratos attacks the mocking Zeus. Gaia returns and tries to kill them, but they escape through a gaping wound in her chest where they continue their battle. Gaia is killed when Kratos impales Zeus against her heart with the Blade of Olympus, which apparently also kills Zeus. When Kratos recovers the blade and tries to leave, he is attacked by Zeus' spirit and loses all of his weapons in the process. Before Zeus can land a fatal blow, Kratos is saved by Pandora during a journey into his psyche. With help from the spirits of his wife Lysandra and daughter Calliope, Kratos forgives himself for his past sins. After discovering the power of hope, he regains consciousness and beats Zeus to death with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>hands,</b> thus ending the reign of the Olympian Gods.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his protective equipment, a catcher usually also adopts practices that minimize his risk of injury. For instance, unlike fielders elsewhere on the field, a catcher tries, to the extent possible, to catch the ball with his gloved hand alone. An outfielder may catch a fly ball by covering the ball, once it strikes {{the pocket of his}} glove, with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>hand</b> in order to secure it. The catcher, however, tries to keep <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>hand,</b> which is highly vulnerable to injury, out of harm's way by presenting the pitcher with a target (the large round glove) while hiding his unprotected throwing hand behind his back. By doing so, the <b>bare</b> <b>hand</b> cannot be struck by a foul tip. Many broken fingers, split fingernails, and grotesque dislocations are avoided by adherence to this simple expedient.|$|R
50|$|Terry is {{also known}} for his {{performance}} on the Ripley's Believe It or Not the TV series, for hammering a 6 inch nail into {{a piece of wood}} with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>hand</b> and then pulling it out with his teeth. He was disqualified for the use of fake teeth.|$|R

25|$|At {{the end of}} the siege, Sauron {{finally came}} forth and fought hand-to hand against Gil-galad and Elendil on the slopes of Mount Doom, but the Dark Lord proved too strong and slew them both. A record left by Isildur in Minas Tirith implies that Sauron himself slew Gil-galad with the heat of <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>hands.</b> Recalling the {{encounter}} at the great Council at Rivendell before the Fellowship took the One Ring south, Elrond said that only he and Círdan stood by Gil-galad in that last mortal contest.|$|E

25|$|Amnesty International {{estimates}} that {{a total of}} {{half a million people}} were killed during the Red Terror of 1977 and 1978. During the terror groups of people were herded into churches that were then burned down, and women were subjected to systematic rape by soldiers. The Save the Children Fund reported that the victims of the Red Terror included not only adults, but 1,000 or more children, mostly aged between eleven and thirteen, whose corpses were left in the streets of Addis Ababa. Mengistu Haile Mariam himself is alleged to have killed political opponents with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nineteen {{people were}} killed and about 235 were wounded. The dead {{included}} seventeen men, one woman, and a seven-year-old girl. Some of the dead were demonstrators while others were simply passers-by. Many were chased by the police and shot or clubbed at the entrance of their houses as they tried to escape. Others were taken from their hiding places and killed. Leopold Tormes, a member of the Puerto Rico legislature, told reporters how a policeman murdered a nationalist with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>hands.</b> Dr. Jose N. Gándara, one of the physicians who assisted the wounded, testified that wounded people running away were shot and that many were again wounded by the clubs and bare fists of the police.

About 150 of the demonstrators were arrested immediately afterward; they were later released on bail.|$|E
25|$|The {{cowboy hat}} is a high-crowned, wide-brimmed hat {{best known as}} the {{defining}} piece of attire for the North American cowboy. Today it is worn by many people, and is particularly associated with ranch workers in the western and southern United States, western Canada and northern Mexico, with country-western singers, and for participants in the North American rodeo circuit. It is recognized around the world as part of Old West cowboy lore. The shape of a cowboy hat's crown and brim are often modified by the wearer for fashion and to protect against weather. The cowboy hat was invented in 1865 by John Batterson Stetson during a hunting trip, showing his companions how he could make fabric out of fur without weaving. Using the fur collected during the trip, <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>hands,</b> and boiling water, Stetson made a piece of felt and then shaped it into a hat with a large brim which could protect him and his hunting party from weather elements such as rain, wind, and snow.|$|E

Paul Konerko broke the franchise record for most home runs hit during the month of April with 11.|$|R
