40|$|A {{number of}} motored auger holes have been drilled in 2002 and 2006 in four sand-clay {{deposits}} preserved in dissolution pockets within the Dinantian limestones of the watershed {{north of the}} Vesdre valley. These deposits of unknown age are currently classified as (Tertiary) SBL in the new geological map of Wallonia. We present detailed lithostratigraphic logs of the deposits and describe the results of sedimentological and mineralogical analyses. In particular, K-Ar dating of neoformed Mn oxides found {{at the base of}} one augerhole at Rechain yielded ages ranging from Cenomanian to Santonian, allowing us to place the Rechain and Andrimont deposits within the early Late Cretaceous. This is fully consistent with their topographic location very close beneath the trace of the pre-Cretaceous erosion surface and makes them the westernmost remains of the Hergenrath Member of the Late Cretaceous Aachen Formation. To the west, the Magnée deposit is more “typical SBL”, probably corresponding to the Late Neogene filling of a <b>dissolution</b> <b>pocket</b> by reworked weathering products of the local Cretaceous cover.
