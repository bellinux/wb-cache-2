5|$|Two {{species are}} {{regarded}} as valid today: the type species S. osborni, and S. angustirostris. S. osborni (Brown, 1912) is known from a skull and skeleton, two other complete skulls, and skull fragments. S. angustirostris (Rozhdestvensky, 1952) is known from at least 15 specimens. It differs from S. osborni by some details of the skull, {{as well as in}} the pattern of scales found in skin impressions. The Mongolian species had a longer skull (by 20%) and the front of the snout (the premaxillary bones) were more upwardly directed. S. angustirostris also had a distinctive row of rectangular scales along the midline of the back and tail, known as 'midline feature-scales'; these are not currently preserved <b>in</b> <b>S.</b> osborni. <b>In</b> <b>S.</b> angustirostris, the scales on the tail flank were arranged in vertical patterns, which may have corresponded to striped coloration in life. This area was covered in radial scale patterns <b>in</b> <b>S.</b> osborni, possibly indicating a more mottled or spotted coloration. S. kryschtofovici (Riabinin, 1930) is not considered valid; either it is regarded as a dubious name, or as a synonym of S. angustirostris (although the name antedates S. angustirostris).|$|E

5|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} protozoa such as Leishmania {{major and}} Trypanosoma cruzi lack the RNAi pathway entirely. Most {{or all of}} the components are also missing in some fungi, most notably the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The presence of RNAi in other budding yeast species such as Saccharomyces castellii and Candida albicans, further demonstrates that inducing two RNAi-related proteins from S. castellii facilitates RNAi <b>in</b> <b>S.</b> cerevisiae. That certain ascomycetes and basidiomycetes are missing RNA interference pathways indicates that proteins required for RNA silencing have been lost independently from many fungal lineages, possibly due to the evolution of a novel pathway with similar function, or to the lack of selective advantage in certain niches.|$|E

With this translation, he wanted to win Pope's favour and translate Pope's Essay on Man, but Pope rejected the idea and, after a lettered response and a possible meeting between the two, Smart translated Pope's An Essay on Criticism (De Arte Critica) instead. The initial letter sent from Pope recommending the future translation was prized by Smart. In response to this letter and his budding relationship with Pope, the Pembroke Fellows honoured him with a portrait showing him holding the letter from Pope and allowed him to write a poem in celebration of Jubilee of Pembroke's 400th year in 1744.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of forbidden minor characterizations for all minor-closed graph families is an equivalent way of stating the Robertson–Seymour theorem. For, suppose that every minor-closed family F has a finite set H of minimal forbidden minors, and let S be any infinite set of graphs. Define F from S {{as the family}} of graphs {{that do not have}} a minor <b>in</b> <b>S.</b> Then F is minor-closed and has a finite set H of minimal forbidden minors. Let C be the complement of F. S is a subset of C since S and F are disjoint, and H are the minimal graphs in C. Consider a graph G in H. G cannot have a proper minor <b>in</b> <b>S</b> since G is minimal in C. At the same time, G must have a minor <b>in</b> <b>S,</b> since otherwise G would be an element in F. Therefore, G is an element <b>in</b> <b>S,</b> i.e., H is a subset of S, and all other graphs <b>in</b> <b>S</b> have a minor among the graphs in H, so H is the finite set of minimal elements of S.|$|E
