We studied seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) behaviour {{as a function of}} manual and automatic <b>feeding</b> <b>distribution</b> modes. Under manual mode, the food is distributed over an extended area for a longer period, and its precise location is not always predictable, while with pneumatic automatic feeders, fish receive the same amount of resource, which is concentrated in the same surface area over a shorter period. We compared seabass behaviour under automatic and manual conditions collecting video image recordings before, during, and after <b>feeding</b> <b>distribution,</b> in the morning and in afternoon, on two different days, and analysing data within independent sessions of measurements. Feeding modes significantly affected swimming behaviour: automatically- fed fish were characterised by vertical movements through the water column (towards the surface and bottom) and by horizontal swimming. Manually-fed fish were instead characterised by sharp direction changes during their swimming, mostly towards the surface. <b>Feeding</b> <b>distribution</b> induced changes in collision frequency and elicited aggressive behaviour.

40|$|Atlantic salmon {{returning}} from marine migrations to eastern Canada and western Ireland during 2002 and 2003 were analysed for tissue concentrations of bio-accumulated caesium 137 (137 Cs). Salmon from Canadian and Irish waters demonstrated concentrations (0. 20 ± 0. 14 Bq kg- 1 and 0. 19 ± 0. 09 Bq kg- 1, mean ± s. d., respectively) suggesting similar oceanic <b>feeding</b> <b>distributions</b> during migration. Canadian aquaculture escapees {{had a similar}} mean tissue concentration (0. 28 ± 0. 22 Bq kg- 1), suggesting migration with wild salmon. However, significantly higher concentrations in 1 -sea-winter (1 SW) escapees (0. 43 ± 0. 25 Bq kg- 1) may alternatively suggest feeding within local estuaries. High concentrations in some Canadian 1 SW salmon indicated trans-Atlantic migration. Low concentrations of Canadian multi-sea-winter (MSW) salmon suggested a <b>feeding</b> <b>distribution</b> in the Labrador and Irminger Seas before homeward migration, because those regions have the lowest surface water 137 Cs levels. Estimates of wild Canadian and Irish salmon feeding east of the Faroes (~ 8 oW) were 14. 2 % and 10. 0 % (1 SW, 24. 7 % and 11. 5 %; MSW, 2. 9 % and 0. 0 %), respectively.

The dunlin showed a tendency to congregate on certain subareas, namely Greenabella (A), and Central (C), Banks. The <b>feeding</b> <b>distribution</b> of the dunlin was examined {{with respect to the}} substratum characteristics, and it was shown that dunlin concentrated on the soft, wet, muddy substrata. Thus, their <b>feeding</b> <b>distribution</b> was influenced by the stage of the tidal cycle. The tide can affect the dunlins’ distribution both directly, by restricting the space in which they can feed, and indirectly, by affecting the substratum's texture (wetness) and hence the availability of prey within it. In general, the feeding dunlins' microdistribution revealed a preference for the "Film" microhabitat. Hence the birds' feeding activity showed a tidal rather than a diurnal periodicity. The feeding behaviour of dunlin was also influenced by the wetness of the substratum, and thereby the tidal situation. Final conclusions, with regard to the Bill length differences between sexes, and the seasonal change in Body Weight, due primarily to the accumulation and depletion of fat reserves are not presented here in order to emphasizetheir tentative nature, resulting from small sample size.

40|$|Nine Mora Romagnola and 10 Large White x Mora Romagnola growing pigs were reared outdoors. In {{both groups}} ad libitum feed was provided. Conventional pigs {{received}} it twice a day, distributed in two long troughs. Inside the corral {{of the second}} group, an automatic station was set up for: <b>feed</b> <b>distribution,</b> pigs weighing, and control by an analog camera. Thus the self-feeders received feed ad libitum individually by the automatic system, divided into small quantities at meal times. During the experiment the analog camera was used over 24 hours each day, to collect pictures of pigs in order to investigate their behaviours. For each picture the day and hour, the number of visible pigs and their behaviours were recorded and a statistical analysis of data, which was expressed as hourly frequencies of behavioural elements, was performed. Moreover to highlight “active” and “passive” behaviours between the groups, two categories “Move” and “Rest” were created grouping some behavioural elements. With regard to performance, conventional pigs reached a higher total weight gain (56. 1 ± 2. 42 kg vs 46. 7 ± 2. 42 kg; P= 0. 0117). But the feed conversion index (FCI) of both groups was similar. The self-feeders had consumed less feed than conventional animals. The feeding system seems to influence behaviours. The percentage {{of time spent in}} Eating activity differs (P< 0. 0001) between the self-fed (median 24. 6 %) and conventional pigs (median 10. 9 %).

The control system allows either automatic or manual operation of the feeding vehicle. Digital electronic circuits capable of implementing the desired control functions were designed;The feeding cycle is manually initiated and automatically terminated when feed has been delivered to all pens requiring feed. It can be partially programmed to enable feed delivery to sections of the feedlot. Two feed rations can be delivered. The feeding status of each pen is recorded. The pen feed rations are stored in reprogrammable memories;The operation of the automated feeding system is based on the automatic identification of the feedlot pens. The number assigned to a pen is coded, using binary pulse-code modulation. Frequency-shift keying is used to transmit the coded number.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to gain new insight into the process of feeding in large scale sea cage aquaculture and investigate novel methods of feeding {{in order to increase}} profitability, welfare and minimize environmental impact. Compared to livestock farming, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farming is a young industry which has experienced an almost exponential growth rate and the product continues to be in high demand. A single cage in Norway may contain more than a 1000 tonnes of fish in the form of 200. 000 individuals. Such a figure is difficult to comprehend, but one may draw a parallel to the equivalent of 1600 cows inside a single cage. Feeding of fish kept in sea cages is a complicated endeavour compared to land based farming for a number of reasons. Thousands of individuals co-exist in a single three-dimensional dynamic space, observation is restricted to surface inspections or a submerged camera with limited field of view, feed can not be given to a specific fish and the location of feed is difficult to predict as a consequence of currents and fish induced turbulence. In addition, feed which is not consumed from the time it is distributed over the surface to it passes through the cage represents a direct economic loss and acts as an unnecessary nutrient discharge to the environment. Over 10. 000 kg of feed may be administered to a single cage towards the end of a production cycle and is the single largest cost in Norwegian salmon farming. Even though the process of feeding is a complicated one, the systems used to distribute feed are simple. Significant effort has been made in determining the ration size, meal frequency and at what time of day Atlantic salmon should be fed. This thesis looks into the temporal feed availability on a meal to meal basis and goes into depth with respect to the spatial availability of feed within the sea cage. Many studies on a smaller scale indicate that spatially and temporally restrictive feeding may lead to unequal feed accessibility, loss of growth potential and elevated levels of aggression. With respect to controlling the spatial distribution of feed, {{it has been shown that}} current methods cover a small area of the cage surface. In addition, existing methods have limited ability to increase the <b>feed</b> <b>distribution</b> without exhibiting other detrimental effects such as increased pellet breakage. There is also no way of controlling where feed is placed as a consequence of wind or currents. Experimental results are presented to better understand the dynamics of a feed spreader, a model has been developed and the performance of different spreader designs investigated. Further experimental results for settling rate and diffusion of pellets are presented and have been used to parametrize a full sea cage model. This model enables simulation of environmental factors, feeding methods and fish to predict the effect on central production parameters. Finally, using these two models, different feeding regimes are simulated and the consequent effects on spatiotemporal <b>feed</b> <b>distribution,</b> feed intake and feed loss are commented upon. It is likely that by increased use of environmental measurements run through <b>feed</b> <b>distribution</b> models and having more adaptable methods of feed placement, one can in the future minimize the environmental impact whilst maintaining high growth rates and good fish welfare...|$|E
