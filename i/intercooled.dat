As {{installed in the}} recently renewed Nissan Cedric/Gloria, this {{had been the first}} turbo engine to power a Japanese production vehicle. One notable aspect of the turbo versions was that they were not <b>intercooled</b> and there was no form of blowoff valve, only an emergency pressure release valve. As usual with Japanese cars of this period, there were four- or five-speed manuals and a three-speed automatic, with a column-shifted three-speed manual available on lower end cars and vans.|$|E

The results of this analysis have been used in a sample calculation and, {{on the basis of this}} calculation, a new inter cooler arrangement is suggested. Because the length of the two air passages of the new arrangement is short in comparison with the third dimension, the height of the <b>intercooler,</b> this <b>intercooler</b> arrangement has unusual dimensions. These dimensions give the proposed <b>intercooler</b> arrangement an advantage over one of usual dimensions because less total power will be consumed by the <b>intercooler,</b> the weight and volume of the <b>intercooler</b> will be smaller, and the pressure drop of both the engine air and the cooling air in passing through the <b>intercooler</b> will be lower...|$|R

25|$|The {{range was}} {{available}} with 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0L petrol engines, with the 1.8-litre four available with an optional turbocharger. The VG20ET V6 was offered {{for the first}} time in Japan in 1984, in a model with an extended front end, called the Bluebird Maxima. This 2-litre V6 was available naturally aspirated or as an <b>intercooled</b> turbo. The U11 Maxima featured a larger 3.0L VG30E. There were also naturally aspirated or turbocharged 2-litre diesels. Counterintuitively, the turbodiesel had better gas mileage in standardized test cycles, presumably due to it being less stressed – as long as one did not take full advantage of its better performance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{systematic}} {{evaluation of}} the solvent capacity and mass transfer benefits of absorber <b>intercooling</b> was conducted for CO 2 capture with 8 m piperazine (PZ) for three different flue gas sources: NGCC (4. 1 % CO 2), coal-fired boiler (14. 7 % CO 2), and steel blast furnace (27. 4 % CO 2). The study identified the best <b>intercooling</b> strategy {{as a function of}} operating conditions (lean loading, liquid to gas ratio (L/G)). For all applications, operation at low lean loadings did not require <b>intercooling</b> to avoid temperature-related capacity or mass transfer penalties. In a broad intermediate loading range, simple in-and-out <b>intercooling</b> provided large solvent capacity benefits (measured as minimum solvent rate, LMIN) compared to a column without <b>intercooling.</b> LMIN was reduced by 71 %, 53 %, and 42 % for NGCC, coal, and steel, respectively. Finally, the coal and steel applications had a large L/G range at higher loadings where <b>intercooling</b> was once again unnecessary. An enhanced <b>intercooling</b> design for NGCC could yield up to 62 % reduction in packing and 46 % reduction in solvent capacity at specific conditions (benefits for coal and steel were much lower). A recycle <b>intercooling</b> design for NGCC was introduced to reduce overall column temperatures and enhance mass transfer. For the case evaluated with recycle <b>intercooling,</b> the new design achieved significant packing reductions (> 50 %) compared to a simple <b>intercooling</b> design and approximated the performance of an isothermal column...|$|R

40|$|When an {{airplane}} is operating at high altitude, {{it is necessary}} to use a supercharger to maintain ground pressure at the carburetor inlet. This maintenance and high intake-manifold pressure tends to keep the power output of the engine at ground-level value. The air, being compressed by the supercharger, however, is heated by adiabatic compression and friction to a temperature that seriously affect the performance of the engine. It is thus necessary to use an <b>intercooler</b> to reduce the temperature of the air between the supercharger outlet and the carburetor inlet. The amount of cooling required of the <b>intercooler</b> depend on the efficiency of the supercharger installation. In this investigation, several types of intercoolers were compared and a design procedure that will give the best <b>intercooler</b> for a given set of conditions is indicated. The figure of merit used for the selection of the best design was the total power consumed by the <b>intercooler.</b> This value includes the power required to transport the weight of the <b>intercooler</b> as well as the power used to force the charge air and the cooling air through the <b>intercooler.</b> The cost, size and practicality of construction were not considered, inasmuch as it was thought that a survey of possibilities of improvement in design would be of interest, regardless of whether the improvement could be immediately realized.

40|$|Chemical {{absorption}} using aqueous amine {{is one of}} {{the most}} feasible options for post-combustion CO 2 capture. One of the main challenges of this technology is its high energy requirements. Absorber <b>intercooling</b> was considered as a viable method to offer benefits in terms of solvent absorption capacity and mass transfer efficiency in CO 2 absorption processes. However, the effectiveness of absorber <b>intercooling</b> on overall energy requirements depends on other factors such as lean loading and liquid to gas ratio. This study evaluates the benefits of using two different configurations of absorber <b>intercooling,</b> i. e. “in-and-out” and “recycled” <b>intercooling</b> when using 30 wt% aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) to capture 90 % CO 2 from a natural gas fired turbine with 4 mol% CO 2. The Lean CO 2 loading was varied from 0. 15 to 0. 42 (mol CO 2 /mol MEA) to determine the lean loading at which the application of <b>intercooling</b> is most significant. Absorber <b>intercooling</b> provides the most benefit at lean loading from 0. 30 to 0. 34. The use of in-and-out and recycle <b>intercooling</b> at 0. 34 lean loading, provided 15. 6 and 15. 8 % reduction in the total equivalent work associated with 32. 0 % and 36. 6 % reduction in required packing area when using 1. 2 times the minimum liquid flow rate. At lean loading greater than 0. 34, the benefit of absorber <b>intercooling</b> is a trade-off between reduction of solvent flow rate and total energy requirement and the drawback of greater packing area in the absorber. The greatest saving in total equivalent work, 17 %, was observed at the 0. 36 lean loading associated with nearly 60 % more packing area when using 1. 2 times the minimum solvent flow rate. At very low lean loading and very high lean loading absorber <b>intercooling</b> does not offer significant benefit...|$|R
5000|$|An {{unavoidable}} side-effect {{of forced}} induction is that compressing air raises its temperature.

These drawbacks are countered by charge-air cooling, which passes the air leaving the turbocharger or supercharger through a heat exchanger typically called an <b>intercooler.</b> This {{is done by}} cooling the charge air with an ambient flow of either air (air-air <b>intercooler)</b> or liquid (liquid-to-air <b>intercooler).</b> The charge air density is increased and the temperature is reduced. In this way an <b>intercooler</b> can greatly increase the ability to run higher absolute compression ratios and {{take full advantage of}} using compressors in series.
