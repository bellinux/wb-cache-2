5|$|Violet {{explains}} to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie {{will be coming}} {{to pick up the}} money from Caesar. The plan is as follows: When Caesar has finished counting the money, Violet will <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> drink to relax him before he showers. Corky will be next-door, waiting until she hears Caesar turn on the shower. When he does, Violet will drop the bottle of Scotch that is for Gino and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, she will let Corky in, who will steal the money from a briefcase and leave. Violet will then return with the Scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leaving, but that Gino was not with him.

Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to skip town because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not his son.|$|E
5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E

25|$|Once Jesus, {{the prophet}} Elijah, and St. George {{were going through}} Georgia. When they became tired and hungry they stopped to dine.

After the shepherd asked his identity Elijah said that, {{he was the one who}} sent him rain to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> good profit from farming. The shepherd became angry at him and told him that he was the one who also sent thunderstorms, which destroyed the farms of poor widows.

25|$|Wilson {{contemplated}} {{standing for}} Parliament. In 1916 the Conservative Party chairman Arthur Steel-Maitland {{had offered to}} <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> seat. Esher and Duncannon proposed forming a new “National” party of 20–30 MPs, which would include David Davies {{who had been on}} the mission to Russia. The new party’s policies would include more vigorous prosecution of the war – Wilson urged Irish conscription – and the detachment of Turkey and Bulgaria. Wilson was worried that it {{would be the end of}} his army career (he was also short of money – he had a private income of £300 a year, and half pay of £600 (£450 after tax) – but his house at Eaton Place was costing him £1,500 a year). His brother Jemmy proposed getting him an Ulster seat, and thought that the prospect of Wilson as an MP would annoy Robertson (who told Wilson that there was no army job for him in Britain), but the Irish Unionist leader Carson thought an English seat more sensible. Bonar Law was dismissive of Wilson’s hopes that, like J.C.Smuts, he might be invited to join the War Policy Committee, and also poured cold water on the idea of Wilson becoming an MP. Wilson did not agree with Milner’s suggestion that he succeed Sarrail as Commander-in-Chief at Salonika. Éamon de Valera of Sinn Féin had recently won the East Clare by-election (caused by the death of Willie Redmond) and on a visit to Currygrane (his first in eight years) everyone Wilson spoke to – judges, landowners, police officers, a Redmondite local politician and “some natives” agreed on the need for conscription. Brock Millman argued that the threat to stand for Parliament was blackmail to get a military job out of Lloyd George, but Keith Jeffery rejects this, arguing that Wilson would have been no threat as a new MP but as a military adviser was a useful rival to Robertson, whom by July 1917 French was telling Wilson Lloyd George wanted to remove.|$|E
500|$|In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) gets to {{know his}} newly {{discovered}} father, Milton Greene (Alda), but quickly learns that Milton needs a kidney transplant, and discovers {{he is not a}} suitable donor.

500|$|When Gatski graduated, Sam Clagg, a {{teammate}} at Marshall, helped <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> tryout with the Cleveland Browns after contacting John Brickels, {{an assistant coach}} with West Virginia ties. The Browns were a new team in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and were set to begin play in 1946. Gatski, who {{was working in the}} mines after graduating from Auburn, hitchhiked to Bowling Green, Ohio for the team's training camp. He did not consider a football career a certainty, and returning to the coal mines where his father had died in an accident was a distinct possibility. [...] "I didn't know what was going to happen," [...] he said later. [...] "I just went up there to see what would happen." ...|$|E
500|$|He bemoaned the Conservatives {{when they}} were in Opposition, criticising Michael Howard in particular: [...] "I knew Michael Howard {{was going to be a}} {{disaster}} as soon as he opposed top-up fees, either out of sentimentality or calculated expediency so that it might <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> bit of the student vote...Instead of backing Tony Blair, causing revolution in the Labour Party, the Conservatives have been whoring after strange gods, coming up with increasingly strange policies." [...] He likened Gordon Brown to the fictional Kenneth Widmerpool, continuing, [...] "It seems to me that with Brown there is a complete sense of humour and charm bypass." [...] Of Ed Miliband, in 2015 he said [...] "He is a man of high ambition and low talent – the worst possible combination. [...] His whole language at the moment is soak the rich, hate the rich." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, Prime Minister Robert Menzies announced the decision to form a Second Australian Imperial Force. He further directed that all commands in the new 6thDivision would go to militiamen. Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey—who was appointed commander of the 6thDivision on 28September—selected Savige to command its 17thInfantry Brigade, the brigade from Victoria. Savige was given the AIF serial number VX13. He and Blamey had worked together when Blamey had commanded the 3rdDivision from 1931 to 1937, and Savige was [...] "almost fanatically loyal to Blamey through bad as well as good times". For regular officers, their exclusion from command positions was [...] "the final straw". Savige suspected—accurately in part—that Staff Corps officers were out to <b>get</b> <b>him.</b> <b>A</b> [...] "general atmosphere of criticism and derogation" [...] infected the force that would eventually sour relations between Blamey and some Staff Corps officers.|$|E

500|$|Nolan {{served in}} Austria, Hungary {{and on the}} Polish frontier, and was again noted for his horsemanship and {{language}} skills. His confidential report from 1838 commended his [...] "great zeal and application", and he was highly popular within the regiment, rising to become the senior lieutenant. Despite this, {{his status as a}} foreigner and a commoner limited his opportunities for promotion. Although promotions in the Austrian Army theoretically were merit-based, in practise the gentry exchanged favours and money unofficially to secure them. Nolan's father attempted to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> commission with the British Army, [...] with little success until Nolan's return to the United Kingdom for the coronation of Queen Victoria in July 1838. While there, he secured an interview with Lord Fitzroy Somerset while his father negotiated with the Austrian General Clam-Gallas to permit Nolan to leave the Austrian armed forces. Eventually, following the payment of £450, Nolan was granted a commission as a Cornet in the 15th Light Dragoons of the British Army on 23 April 1839. His resignation from the Austrian army was never formally accepted, and he was struck off the rolls on 31 October 1899, 45 years after his death.|$|E
500|$|Bart {{goes on a}} class {{field trip}} to a box factory.

Krusty is angry that his assistant has failed to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> Danish, as Bart had eaten it, and fires his assistant on the spot. Bart steals a Danish from Kent Brockman and gives it to Krusty, who is grateful and asks him to become his new assistant. Bart soon gets disillusioned with being Krusty's assistant because the cast members do not treat him well and he does not receive any credit for his work. However, before Bart decides to quit, Krusty offers to let him say one line in a sketch when Sideshow Mel is unavailable thanks to Bart giving him a sandwich with cheese which triggers his lactose intolerance. Bart messes up his line and stumbles, accidentally destroying all of the props on the stage. With the crowd and cameras focused on him, he says [...] "I didn't do it", which causes the audience to erupt with laughter. Seeing Bart's popularity, Krusty uses him and his [...] "I didn't do it" [...] catchphrase in later sketches, and eventually creates a franchise out of it.|$|E
500|$|Thereafter, Sherman became {{president}} of the St. Louis Railroad, a streetcar company, a position he would hold for only a few months. Thus, he was living in border-state Missouri as the secession crisis came to a climax. While trying to hold himself aloof from controversy, he observed firsthand the efforts of Congressman Frank Blair, who later served under Sherman, to hold Missouri in the Union. In early April, he declined an offer from the Lincoln administration to take a position in the War Department as a prelude to his becoming Assistant Secretary of War. After the bombardment of Fort Sumter, Sherman hesitated about committing to military service and ridiculed Lincoln's call for 75,000 three-month volunteers to quell secession, reportedly saying: [...] "Why, you might as well attempt to put out the flames of a burning house with a squirt-gun." [...] However, in May, he offered himself for service in the regular army, and his brother (Senator John Sherman) and other connections maneuvered to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> commission in the regular army. On June 3, he wrote that [...] "I still think {{it is to be a}} long war – very long – much longer than any Politician thinks." [...] He received a telegram summoning him to Washington on June 7.|$|E
