Paul Weber presumes that only Tandy and Blackwell offered active resistance to the ensuing arrest: “Blackwell vehemently complained about this violent intrusion on his rights as a French officer, but his furious protests were to no avail.” [...] Corbet too demanded to know on whose authority the soldiers acted? [...] Weber informs us that among the letters found upon Blackwell’s person, there is one unfinished, the completion of which appears to have been prematurely prevented during those early hours of the twenty-fourth: “He must have left Lady Pamela’s home in a state of emotional confusion” and, influenced by “a guilty conscience, wrote, ‘there, <b>dear</b> <b>Madam,</b> let us have none affliction in the common of two.’ Blackwell was obviously at pains to reason his female addressee out of a liaison, the beginnings of which had left him utterly bewildered.” [...] To all appearances, Weber speculates, the supper party did not stop at political talks.|$|E

Time is too short for ceremonies. I swear solemnly, in all the tenor of my former oath, to remember you in all the pride and warmth of friendship until I cease to be!

For instance, yesterday I dined at a friend's at some distance; the savage hospitality of this country spent me the most part of the night over the nauseous potion in the bowl: this day--sick--headache--low spirits--miserable--fasting, except for a draught of water or small beer: now eight o'clock at night--only able to crawl ten minutes walk into Mauchline to wait the post, in the pleasurable hope of hearing from the mistress of my soul.|$|R
