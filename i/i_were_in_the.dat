500|$|The Spanish {{media has}} often {{compared}} Villa with Raúl, {{to the point}} where Villa was accused of taking the number 7 jersey away from the then-Real Madrid player. In March 2009, Villa spoke out, saying, [...] "I have not taken anything away from anybody, I was simply playing well for my club and the national coach gave me an opportunity. Too much has been said about the number issue. I’m not looking to cause any controversy. In fact, Raúl and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> national squad together in the past. I haven’t forced anybody out." [...] When questioned on whether the whole uproar created over Raúl's omission was affecting him personally, he said, [...] "I've never liked it because I think it has been damaging for the both of us. We've always got on well together whenever we've met up for international duty, so I'm not concerned. I just work hard for myself. All I want is to be in the squad for every game, to have the Spain badge on my chest and to score as many goals as I can." ...|$|E
500|$|People's {{reactions}} varied: some {{described themselves}} as [...] "shocked"; others admitted to being [...] "shaky" [...] or nervous {{for the rest of}} the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My husband and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".|$|E
2500|$|A {{stirring}} speech against {{racial discrimination}} {{was given by}} African-American activist Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, in which she said [...] "You white women speak here of rights. I speak of wrongs.

2500|$|The poem {{has been}} {{translated}} into Danish, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Ilocano, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog, and other languages. Several Swedish versions exist. One version starts: [...] "Gråt ej vid min grav..." [...] Translated, it reads: [...] "Do not weep at my grave - <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not there / <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun's reflection <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea / <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind's play above the grain fields / <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> autumn's gentle rain / <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Milky Way's string of stars / And when on an early morning you are awaked by bird's song / It is my voice that you are hearing / So do not weep at my grave - we shall meet again." [...] (Instead of these last four words there is also this version: [...] "I <b>am</b> not dead. <b>I</b> only left".) ...|$|R
2500|$|As an {{opposition}} stalwart {{and leader of}} the CPI group, Gupta's speeches in the Lok Sabha were marked by 'force with moderation, criticism with reason', and earned him the admiration of even his political opponents. Though not enamoured of office, Gupta accepted the cabinet berth in the United Front Government during 1996–98. As Home Minister, Gupta was still blunt about government's failures and raised many an eyebrow among the treasury benches with his frank observations. When he was the Home Minister and the BJP the main opposition party, his favourite phrase on meeting the more vocal opposition members after a stormy day was: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Opposition I'd have done what you did." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the November 2010 FOMC meeting, Warsh was {{extremely}} {{skeptical of the}} Fed's plan to generate economic activity and jobs by trying to lower long-term interest rates. Although unemployment was close to 10%, Warsh told his colleagues that he would only vote for QE2 {{out of respect for}} Chairman Bernanke: [...] "If I were in your chair, I would not be leading the Committee in this direction, and frankly, if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chair of most people around this room, I would dissent." [...] Even if unemployment were [...] "unacceptably high," [...] he suggested that he would vote against the program continuing if inflation inched up a bit: [...] "if inflation were to move up and were to be broadly consistent with the implicit inflation target [...] in different people's minds around this room, even if unemployment were unacceptably high, I think that would be time to stop this program. If inflation expectations were {{to move out of the}} range that they have been in for a long time, that would be a reason to end this program, even if unemployment were exceptionally high and GDP were well below what we think the economy is ultimately capable of." [...] The Federal Reserve has a legal dual mandate to pursue maximum employment as well as to ensure price stability.|$|E
