50|$|Price was {{primarily}} active from the 1950s {{to the late}} 1970s, designing private residences, hotels, motels, schools, a social club, a beach house and commercial buildings. His preference for trimly-detailed buildings with walls treated as planes of glass or solidly paneled surfaces is evident {{in many of the}} buildings he designed in Galveston. These include the Seahorse Motel (1956, now demolished) and the Beachcomber Motel (1963) on Seawall Boulevard, the Galveston Artillery Club (1959) on Avenue O, the gymnasium of Gladneo Parker Elementary School (1960) on 69th Street, and his largest project that he worked on in the city, the 10-story Sealy & Smith Professional Building (1964, demolished in 2007) on University Boulevard. Price designed several of the most distinctive modern houses built in Galveston, among them the Caravageli House (1954) on Caduceus Place, the Stirling <b>House</b> on <b>South</b> Shore <b>Drive</b> (1956), the Mehos House on Harbor View Drive (1958), the Yen House on Marine Drive (1959), and the Kelso Camp on Offatts Bayou (1963).
