50|$|The Z Grip pens {{include the}} F-301, F-301 Compact, F-402, and the F-701. The 301 series is {{characterized}} by stainless steel shafts and hardened plastic grips. The 401 has the same stainless steel shaft with a rubber grip. Finally, the flagship pen, the 701 has a <b>knurled</b> <b>grip</b> and is completely stainless steel.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} walnut {{stock is}} an ambidextrous stock manufactured by Minelli in Italy and features a thumb hole cut out with <b>knurled</b> and engraved <b>grip</b> and siding.|$|R

50|$|Metals may {{be drawn}} into a tubular shape, or tubular {{extruded}} stock can be machined to add threads for the head and tail cap, <b>knurling</b> for <b>grip,</b> and decorative and functional flats or holes in the body. LED flashlights may have cooling fins machined into their metal cases. Plastics are often injection molded into nearly final shape, requiring only a few more process steps to complete assembly.Metal cases provide better heat dissipation for the LED, but plastics are not electrically conductive and may resist corrosion and wear.|$|R
5000|$|Adjustable {{dumbbells}} {{consist of}} a metal bar whose centre portion is often engraved with a crosshatch pattern (<b>knurling)</b> to improve <b>grip.</b> Weight plates are slid onto the outer portions of the dumbbell and secured with clips or collars. Shown to the right is a [...] "spinlock" [...] dumbbell, whose ends are threaded to accept large nuts as collars. Alternatively, a dumbbell may have smooth ends with plates being secured by a sprung collar. Nowadays, many commercially sold dumbbells are available with sophisticated, and easy-to-use methods for weight increments adjustments.|$|R
50|$|Set screws {{appear with}} a variety of tip (point) types. The {{different}} shaped tips have different properties that engineers can utilize. If an engineer were to use a detent to ensure proper nesting of the screw, they might choose to use a cone point type of screw. One might often need to use a flat point when the screw must press perfectly flat against a surface. The most common type is the cup point. This type works well because the surface is rounded so that a small surface area is in contact, but it does not have extremely high stress at one point like that of a cone point. Durability studies show that the cup point offers superior resistance to wear while maintaining a strong <b>grip.</b> <b>Knurled</b> cup points offer the added advantage of a locking action (similar to that of a serrated lock washer) that prevents the screws from working loose in high-vibration applications.|$|R
5000|$|The Fairbairn-Sykes was {{produced}} in several patterns. The Shanghai knife on which it was based was only about 5.5 in long in the blade. First pattern knives have a 6.5 in blade with a flat area, or ricasso, {{at the top of}} the blade which was not present on the original design and the presence of which has not been explained by the manufacturers, under the S-shaped crossguard. Second-pattern knives have a slightly longer blade (just less than 7 in), 2 in-wide oval crossguard, <b>knurled</b> pattern <b>grip,</b> and rounded ball, and may be stamped [...] "ENGLAND" [...] (a US legal requirement when importing the surplus knives after WWII, as they had to show the country of origin) on the handle side of the cross guard. Some may also be stamped with a [...] "Broad Arrow" [...] /|\ British issue mark and a number (e.g., 21) on the opposite handle side of the cross guard. Third-pattern knives also have a similarly sized seven-inch blade, but the handle was redesigned to be a ringed grip. This ringed grip is reputed to have distressed one of the original designers as it unbalanced the weapon and made harder to hold when wet, but it was used by the manufacturers as it was simple to produce and could be cast from a cheaper and more plentiful alloy instead of using up scarce quantities of brass stock which were, of course, required for ammunition casings and other such vital applications. William Rodgers, as part of the Egginton Group, now also produce an all-black [...] "sterile" [...] version of the knife, which is devoid of any markings showing maker for NATO use.|$|R
