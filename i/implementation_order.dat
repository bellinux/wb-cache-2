The basis for determining armed forces pay, level, status, pension, recommended by 7CPC is similar to 6CPC, except for terminological changes. The 7CPC recommended replacing 'grade pay and pay bands' of 6CPC, with two [...] "Pay Matrices": one for the civil services, police, defence civilians, and another for the armed forces. The term 'levels', is analogous to grade pay, and rank. The matrix for the civilian security sector (police and defence civilians), provides for time scale pay promotions at 4, 9, 13, 14, and 16/18 years of service. The time scale promotions for the armed forces for time scale levels at 6, 13, 21 years of service. The differentiated and asymmetries pay matrices have become a contentious issue, and are not in accord with historical parities, according to the Armed forces.

5000|$|The {{recommendation}} of the 7CPC affecting the armed forces are a cause of profound unease and resentment in the Armed Forces, especially, 7CPC recommendation on separate 'Pay Matrices', and allowance system for {{the armed forces and}} defence civilians, and police, and other civil servants. While 7CPC provides for mandated timescale promotions to from Defence civilians from audit and account services, police, and other officers at regular intervals of 4, 9, 13, 14, and 16 years of service; it does not do so armed forces officers. The orders implemented by the government on the basis of 7 CPC recommendation, despite armed forces advise and concerns, make time scale police officers and defence civilians, with lesser service and experience, senior to armed forces officers, and potentially in command of armed forces officers of equal or more seniority. For instance, Wing Commanders of the Air Force, commander of the navy, and Lt colonel of the army, with 13 years of service, according to MOD implementation tables, will be subordinate in 'level', rank, pay scale, and organizational hierarchy than police officers, auditors, accountants, with equal or even lesser service.2MOD <b>implementation</b> <b>order</b> has created an invidious situation for armed forces officers when serving alongside defence civilians and police officer.

The letter draws attention to Governments executive order dated 26 Feb 14 for the implementation of OROP, and the notification issued on 7 November 2015.The letter examines five salient anomalies in the OROP scheme 2015 as follows: (1) Fixation of pension as per calendar year 2013 would result in past retirees getting less pension of one increment than the soldier retiring today. This will completely destroy definition of OROP approved by two Parliaments and will also result in loss of one increment across the board for past pensioners in perpetuity. (2) Fixing pension as mean of Min and Max pension of 2013 would result in more anomalies wherein same ranks with same length of service will draw two or more different pensions thus violating the very principle of OROP. (3) OROP has been approved in budget of 2014-15 by two parliaments. As per norms of Government, all proposals approved in budget are applicable from 1st April of that FY. In the case of OROP, the Govt had issued specific orders to its applicability wef 1st April 14. Hence implementation date for OROP from 1st July will be against the Parliament approval. Changing the date would result in loss of 3 months emoluments for OROP across the board. However, if OROP implementation date is to be kept as 1st July, then the base pension should also be accepted as per the PPOs of July 2014. (4) Pension equalisation every five year will result in a senior rank soldier drawing lesser pension than a junior rank soldier for five years thus OROP definition will be violated for five years. This will also result in permanent violation of definition as fresh cases will come up every year. (5) There are numerous errors in the constitution of Tables. How this Table have been made is not known. The fact is that no senior rank defence personnel should ever draw less pension their junior persons. There are numerous instances in the Tables where in the senior rank and senior in service have been shown to draw less pension then his junior. The tables need to be worked out afresh after all anomalies have been removed. The most appropriate method to construct Tables would be to base these tables on live data. The PPOs of defence personnel who retired in 2013 would removal that a Sepoy with 15 years of service should get pension of approx Rs 7200 per month where as in the Tables, pension has been mentioned as Rs 6665/-. This does not satisfy the approved OROP definition. There are minimum such examples. Nb Subedar of ‘Y’ group has been shown to get less then X Gp Havildar this making a senior rank defence, personal gets less than junior rank. Nb Sub TA is shown getting more pension then Regular Nb Sub. The three Service HQs pay cells must be involved in making this Table afresh. These anomalies will result in lesser pensions to widows, soldiers, NCOs and JCOs than what will be due to them on approval of OROP. This will result in veterans not getting OROP as per approved definition and will create much discontent across all ranks. There is a need to have a relook at the pensions of Hon Nb Subedars, Majors and Lt Cols. a) Some Havildars are granted rank of Hon Naib Subedar in view of their exemplary service. These soldiers are not granted pension of Naib Subedar thus making the Hon rank just ceremonial. Hon Naib Subedars should get pension of a Naib Subedar rather than that of a Havildar. Similarly, this must be accepted as a principle and it should be applicable to all Hon ranks in case of NCOs and JCOs. b) Moreover no officer is retiring in Major rank now. In the past, officers were promoted to Major rank after completing 13 yrs of service whereas present officers are getting promotion of Lt Col in 13 yrs. It will be justified to grant all pensioners of the rank of Major, minimum pension of Lt Col as they cannot be compared to present retirees as officers are not retiring as Majors any more. Number of such affected officers is not more than 800 and will not cause heavy burden to Govt. c) Similarly, all pre-2004 retiree Lt Cols should get the minimum pension of full Col. Presently all officers retire in the rank of Colonel hence all Lt Col equivalents should be granted min pension of Colonels. The above anomalies/discrepancies are being brought before you for resolution please.

40|$|To date, the {{interaction}} among different mitigation options at one industrial site {{has not been}} investigated in literature. There is insufficient knowledge available on {{the interaction}} between energy efficiency measures (EEMs) and post-combustion capture. Further research on these interactions is needed as they may strongly influence the techno-economic performance of EEMS and/or post-combustion capture. The objective {{of this study is}} two-fold. First, it examines the CO 2 emission reduction potential and techno-economic performance of post-combustion capture and energy efficiency measures at an oil refinery. Second, this study examines under which conditions EEMs and post-combustion capture can be jointly implemented from a techno-economic and practical perspective. This is assessed by first calculating the techno-economic performances of post-combustion and energy efficiency measures separately. Then, different scenarios are assessed where these mitigation options are combined at the case refinery. These scenarios differ in <b>implementation</b> <b>order</b> (EEMs first or post-combustion capture first) and regeneration heat supply for post-combustion capture (NGCC or excess heat). For comparison, also scenarios will be assessed where practical issues and interactions between mitigation options are ignored. The results show that when EEMs and post-combustion capture are combined, a total CO 2 reduction potential of 482 ktCO 2 per year is achievable at the case refinery of this study. This corresponds to a reduction of 87 %. This is in a scenario where EEMs are implemented first and the required heat for post-combustion capture is supplied by excess heat. From the perspective of the refinery this proved to be the preferable scenario. From a global perspective, the scenario with NGCC as heat supply proved to be preferable because of the excess electricity production that can be sold to the grid. Indirectly, the total global CO 2 avoidance is then much larger. Comparing the scenarios with each other shows that <b>implementation</b> <b>order</b> influences the avoidance costs of post-combustion capture by 1 - 4 €/tCO 2. Practical issues and interactions between mitigation options could lead to avoidance costs for post-combustion capture of up to 28 €/tCO 2 higher (for a NGCC with high heat demand) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—As a vital {{activity}} for companies, new product development (NPD) {{is also a}} very risky process due to the high uncertainty degree encountered at every development stage and the inevitable dependence on how previous steps are successfully accomplished. Hence, there is an apparent need to evaluate new product initiatives systematically and make accurate decisions under uncertainty. Another major concern is the time pressure to launch a significant number of new products to preserve and increase the competitive power of the company. In this work, we propose an integrated decision-making framework based on neural networks and fuzzy logic to make appropriate decisions and accelerate the evaluation process. We are especially interested in the two initial stages where new product ideas are selected (go/no go decision) and the <b>implementation</b> <b>order</b> of the corresponding projects are determined.

40|$|Universal {{design process}} is a multi-constraint task due to many user {{requirements}} and the complexities caused by {{the interaction of the}} requirements in developing design solutions. Since all universal design requirements cannot be equally satisfied, a designer must determine the relative importance and <b>implementation</b> <b>order</b> of each requirement. Prioritisation of requirements is needed, not just to ignore the least important but also to guide designers while coping with dependencies, conflicts and trade-offs between multi-attribute requirements simultaneously. Thus, this study proposes a priority-based approach for satisfying diverse users' needs, capabilities and expectations in a design process conducted in a computer environment. The planning game technique and the analytic hierarchy process technique using a cost-value approach are the two techniques that are applied in prioritising the diverse requirements. The derived priority information is incorporated into a CAD interface with a developed plug-in tool. A universal kitchen design is chosen as a case study for the priority-based approach. The results of the acceptability studies indicate that the proposed plug-in tool is found useful, understandable, efficient, helpful and satisfactory in universal design process and can be developed for various architectural design applications. © 2010 Taylor & Francis...|$|E

The study was designed to measure changes in deinstitutionalization rate and expenditures resulting from (a) the existence of relevant litigation in a state, (b) the act of filing a lawsuit, (c) issuance of a consent decree or court order, and (d) termination of court involvement. ^ Study 1 involved three states [...] Nebraska which experienced litigation in the 1970 s, North Dakota which experienced litigation in the 1980 s, and South Dakota which experienced no relevant litigation [...] in an Interrupted Time Series with Switching Replications and Nonequivalent No-Treatment Control Group design. The analysis indicated that the filing of the Nebraska lawsuit and the final <b>implementation</b> <b>order</b> in the North Dakota lawsuit significantly increased deinstitutionalization rates. The analysis also revealed that the termination of the Nebraska lawsuit resulted in a significant decrease in the Nebraska deinstitutionalization rate. ^ Study 2 involved comparisons between two groups; one group consisted of 37 states which had been involved in institutional litigation culminating in a consent decree or court order for plaintiffs, and the other group consisted of 10 states which had not been involved in litigation. The litigation states showed a significantly higher rate of deinstitutionalization from 1977 to 1988 than control states. Litigation states also proportionately expended more public funds for total developmental disability services, services in congregate settings, and community services; however, the differences were not statistically significant. ^ The results indicate that judicial involvement in developmental disability policy has been effective in reforming institutions and remedying rights violations of persons with developmental disabilities.
