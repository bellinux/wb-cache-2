5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop <b>kidney</b> involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) {{of blood in the}} urine.

While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic <b>kidney</b> disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many <b>kidneys</b> are {{rejected}} for transplantation due to inadequate in situ perfusion during organ retrieval {{because of the}} risk of additional ischaemic injury and microvasculature thrombosis. This study describes the use of ex vivo normothermic perfusion (EVNP) for the resuscitation and assessment of human <b>kidneys</b> that were discarded after inadequate in situ perfusion. METHODS: Twenty-two human <b>kidneys</b> were retrieved but then deemed unsuitable for transplantation, primarily due to inadequate in situ perfusion. After a period of static cold storage, <b>kidneys</b> were perfused for 60  min with an oxygenated red cell based solution at 36  °C. RESULTS: Nineteen out of 22 <b>kidneys</b> (86  %) were from DCD donors. During EVNP, <b>kidneys</b> were assessed and scored based on their macroscopic appearance, measures of renal blood flow and urine production. <b>Kidneys</b> were scored from 1 indicating the least injury to 5, indicating the worst. Twelve <b>kidneys</b> had an EVNP score of 1 - 2, 7 scored 3 - 4 and 3 <b>kidneys</b> scored 5. The EVNP score 5 <b>kidneys</b> had a low level of tubular function compared to the score 1 - 4 <b>kidneys.</b> Their perfusion parameters did not improve during EVNP and they were considered non-transplantable. There was no association between the histological evaluation and EVNP parameters. CONCLUSION: EVNP restores function ex vivo and enables an assessment of <b>kidneys</b> that have been declined for transplantation due to inadequate in situ perfusion.

These <b>kidneys,</b> together with matching urine (n = 18) and blood (n = 24) samples, were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the LipL 32 gene.

BackgroundThe benefits of percutaneous angioplasty of renal artery stenosis is not known. In {{an attempt to}} better define the patient subgroup most likely to benefit from a revascularization procedure, the relationship between renal arterial morphology, blood flow volume, and renal volume was investigated using magnetic resonance (MR) techniques. MethodsAnalysis was based on arterial flow volume and renal volume measurements of 130 <b>kidneys</b> in 65 patients with clinically suspected renal vascular disease. Significant renal arterial stenosis (RAS), documented by contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography, compromised blood supply to 31 <b>kidneys.</b> Renal volume measurements {{were related to the}} body mass index to derive the renal volume index (RVI). The RVI of 72 <b>kidneys</b> in 36 patients without evidence of RAS or severe renal insufficiency was used as a standard of reference to differentiate normal-volume from reduced-volume <b>kidneys.</b> ResultsEighteen out of 31 RAS <b>kidneys</b> were significantly reduced in volume (3. 08 ± 0. 75); the volume of the remaining 13 <b>kidneys</b> was within one standard deviation of the normal reference value. Flow volumes in <b>kidneys</b> with RAS were significantly reduced compared with <b>kidneys</b> without RAS (91. 56 vs. 279. 15 ml/min). Based on the RFI values (RFI = flow volume/renal volume), there was only minimal overlap between normal volume <b>kidneys</b> with RAS (0. 73 ± 0. 34) and <b>kidneys</b> without RAS (2. 02 ± 0. 59). RFI values of small volume <b>kidneys</b> with RAS (1. 55 ± 0. 47), on the other hand, overlapped with both groups. ConclusionsNormal volume <b>kidneys</b> with impaired arterial flow caused by RAS can be differentiated from those without based on a flow index (RFI).
