40|$|Abstract: Recent {{advances}} in mobile and wireless technology have made possible {{new types of}} information systems supporting key activities in transport organizations. By including mobile actors and equipment, such technology is a key enabler for realizing the vision of enterprise system support in this context. This paper focuses on {{a particular type of}} transport organization, that of <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> firms. The term Transport Information Systems (TIS) is used to discuss a specific type of enterprise technology, incorporating support for critical mobile aspects of <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> firms and relevant functionality of conventional enterprise systems. To capture expectations of enterprise support in <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> business, a qualitative interview study including 18 Swedish <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> firms was performed. Building on the results of the study, this paper contributes a set of sociotechnical challenges important for successful implementation of TIS in <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> firms. In addition, this paper outlines implications for future research on enterprise systems in transport organizations. ...|$|R

50|$|Mr English was {{employed}} at Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd’s colliery at Glencraig from 27 March 1933. He was repairing an airway leading off the Mine Jigger Brae, a main <b>haulage</b> <b>road.</b> Between 1:30pm and 2pm {{he was going}} to the pit bottom and the haulage plant was put in motion. He tried to escape through one of the manholes, but was caught by a rake of hutches and crushed between it and the side of the road. His family claimed damages.

He told Bonsall, the manager: [...] "something has happened down the Dennis. I think it has fired." [...] Bonsall went into the mine to try to establish what had occurred. At approximately 3.30am, the under-manager and overman from Martin, Benjamin Edwards, reported that parts of the Dennis main road were on fire beyond the Clutch (a point where the main <b>haulage</b> <b>road</b> took a 60° left deviation) and that a large number of miners were trapped beyond the blaze. Meanwhile, the shift that was working the Slant in Martin was ordered to the pit bottom and told to get out of the mine.|$|E

The evidence of Williams, Bonsall and the overman Ben Edwards, who all saw the fire at this critical point, differed on how large it was: Bonsall thought they could not {{get close enough to}} it to fight it, but Edwards said that it did [...] "not seem much of a fire", and the final report of the inquest was inconclusive as to whether the fire could have been put out if better equipment had been to hand.|$|E

50|$|The Thistleton {{area has}} shown {{evidence}} of Romano-British occupation including a large temple precinct {{and a possible}} small market settlement. To {{the north of the}} village there has been extensive mining for ironstone, a stone that has featured very prominently in the building of many churches and other buildings in the area for centuries. It was thought that the mining had obliterated evidence of the former greater extent of the village but much archaeology has survived showing that the original Romano-British settlement extended some 100 acre at least. Extensive surveys, brought about by the planning of a <b>haulage</b> <b>road</b> to the quarry to pass through the site of the ancient township, revealed features including a well preserved Roman road and the skeleton of a child buried well away from the cemetery. The archaeology is ongoing as the mining continues.|$|E
50|$|Subsequent to the {{accident}} {{a number of}} theories were advanced in the Report as to the explosion's exact cause: Sir Stafford Cripps, the miners' legal representative, suggested that an explosion had been triggered in 95's by shotfiring (the firing of explosive charges) near a main airway. The miners' appointed Assessor also surmised that a large quantity of gas had accumulated {{at the top of}} the face in 14's district, which was then ignited by an accident with a safety lamp or by a spark from a coalcutter. The legal representatives of the pit's management, however, suggested that firedamp had accumulated in the main Dennis <b>haulage</b> <b>road</b> beyond the Clutch (a junction on the main drift where the underground haulage machinery was located) and which was ignited at the Clutch when a telephone was used to warn miners of the influx of gas. This interpretation sought to deny that poor working practices were the ultimate cause of the disaster.|$|E
50|$|For general applications, a berm is a physical, {{stationary}} {{barrier of}} some kind. For example, in modern highway construction, a berm is a noise barrier constructed of earth, often landscaped, running along a highway to protect adjacent land users from noise pollution. The shoulder {{of a road}} is also called a berm and in New Zealand the word describes a publicly owned grassed nature strip sometimes planted with trees alongside urban roads. http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/SiteCollectionDocuments/aboutcouncil/governingbody/governingbodyminattitem11e20121025.pdf In Snowboard Cross, a berm is a wall of snow built up in a corner. In Mountain biking, a berm is a banked turn formed by soil, commonly dug from the track, being deposited on the outer rim of the turn. In coastal systems, a berm is a raised ridge of pebbles or sand found at high tide or storm tide marks on a beach. In snow removal, a berm or windrow refers to the linear accumulation of snow cast aside by a plow. In open-pit mining, a berm refers to dirt and rock piled alongside a <b>haulage</b> <b>road</b> or {{along the edge of}} a dump point. Intended as a safety measure, they are commonly required by government organizations to be at least half as tall as the wheels of the largest mining machine on-site.|$|E

40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>haulage</b> {{operations}} in general, and distribution in particular, are inefficient. Given the societal importance of <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> {{and the low}} efficiency of the sector, road hauliers need to improve their operations and systematically tackle inefficiencies. However, the real causes of these inefficiencies, the “root causes”, have not been sufficiently examined in previous studies. This paper expands on prior research by adapting existing models {{that can be used}} to identify the root causes of inefficiencies, and to enable systematic improvements in road transport operations. Our research is based on a lean approach and an adapted version of Ishikawa’s model. It is shown as a matrix based on transport processes and the Ishikawa categories to identify the root causes of inefficiencies in <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> that influence performance. The adapted model was tested in three <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> case studies. Our findings suggest that most efficiency problems appear in the actual transport execution...|$|R

50|$|In total, only 11 bodies (eight {{miners and}} the three rescue men) were ever {{recovered}} from the mine. Inquests recorded {{the cause of death}} as carbon monoxide poisoning. The mine shafts remained sealed for six months, after which unaffected districts were gradually re-entered. Recovery teams first entered the pit, using breathing apparatus, on 7 March 1935. The damage caused by explosions and by the water directed down the pit was severe, and efforts concentrated on building stoppings so that fresh air could be readmitted to the pit. In May, Parry Davies, captain of the Llay Main No. 2 rescue team, accompanied by two inspectors and a Ministry of Mines doctor, entered into the 20's return airway to recover the body of John Lewis of Cefn-y-Bedd, {{one of the members of}} the No. 1 team killed in the initial rescue attempts. By July, a party of men using breathing apparatus had proceeded 700 yards beyond the stoppings into the Dennis section as far as the top of the <b>haulage</b> <b>road</b> of the 142's Deep, though they found no trace of any of the missing miners. Within a matter of months, normal ventilation was restored to the Slant section: this work was, to that date, the first ever reopening of a pit by men working in an irrespirable atmosphere. However, the mining inspectors refused to allow recovery teams to go further into the Dennis districts to retrieve bodies after retrieving air samples from beyond the permanent stoppings (the mine's ventilation system), this was despite calls from the workers themselves that they should be allowed to do so. Dennis was never reopened; the bodies of the remaining 254 victims of the disaster would be left in the sealed districts.|$|E
