5|$|Febuxostat is {{typically}} only recommended {{in those who}} cannot tolerate allopurinol. Probenecid appears to be less effective than allopurinol and is a second line agent.

It is, however, not recommended if a person <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> of kidney stones. Pegloticase is an option for the 3% {{of people who are}} intolerant to other medications.
