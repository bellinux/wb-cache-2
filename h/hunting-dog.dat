60|$|Then at a {{rustling}} step he froze {{into the}} old strained attention. He heard a slow patter of soft feet. A tawny shape crossed a little opening in the thicket. It {{was that of a}} dog. The moment while that beast came into full view was an age. The dog was not a bloodhound, and if he had a trail or a scent he seemed to be at fault on it. Duane waited for the inevitable discovery. Any kind of a <b>hunting-dog</b> could have found him in that thicket. Voices from outside could be heard urging on the dog. Rover they called him. Duane sat up at the moment the dog entered the little shaded covert. Duane expected a yelping, a baying, or at least a bark that would tell of his hiding-place. A strange relief swiftly swayed over Duane. The end was near now. He had no further choice. Let them come--a quick fierce exchange of shots--and then this torture past! He waited for the dog to give the alarm.|$|E
60|$|What Won-tolla {{had said}} {{meant that the}} dhole, the red <b>hunting-dog</b> of the Dekkan, was moving to kill, and the Pack knew well that even the tiger will {{surrender}} a new kill to the dhole.

The dhole, for instance, do not begin to call themselves a pack till they are a hundred strong; whereas forty wolves make a very fair pack indeed. Mowgli's wanderings had taken him {{to the edge of the}} high grassy downs of the Dekkan, and he had seen the fearless dholes sleeping and playing and scratching themselves in the little hollows and tussocks that they use for lairs. He despised and hated them because they did not smell like the Free People, because they did not live in caves, and, above all, because they had hair between their toes while he and his friends were clean-footed. But he knew, for Hathi had told him, what a terrible thing a dhole hunting-pack was. Even Hathi moves aside from their line, and until they are killed, or till game is scarce, they will go forward.|$|E
60|$|Mr. MacLennan gave me sundry beetles, but {{insisted on}} {{retaining}} {{one which is}} the largest I ever saw. The <b>hunting-dog</b> must scour the bush in packs, for the voice is exactly that of hounds. The laugh of the hyæna and the scream of the buzzard are commonly heard. The track of a 'bush-cow' once crossed my path: the halves of the spoor were some five inches long by three wide, and the hoofs knuckled backwards so as to show false hoofs of almost equal size. I was unable to procure for Dr. Günther a specimen of the 'bush-dog,' as the Kruboys call it: last year I was bringing home a live one in the s.s. Nubia; but one day the fellow in charge reported that it was dead and had been thrown overboard. I hold it to be a tailless lemur, the galago of the East Coast. The French name is orson, the popular idea being that it is an ursine. The Fanti peoples, whose 'folk-lore' is extensive, and who have some tale about every bird, beast, and fish, thus account for the loud cries which we heard at night in every 'bush.' King Leo, having lost his mother, commanded by proclamation all his subjects to attend her funeral, and none failed save Orson. One evening his Feline Majesty, when going his rounds, found the delinquent upon the ground, and roughly demanded the reason why. Orson, shuffling towards the nearest tree, pleaded in all humility, 'O King, is thy beloved parent really deceased? I never heard of it. I am so sorry; I would never have failed to show the respect due to the royal house.' When he had climbed the foot of the tree his tone began to alter. 'But, Sire, if thy Majesty hath lost a mother, I see no cause compelling me to attend her funeral.' And when quite safe the change was notable. 'Bother the old woman! very glad she is dead, and may her grave be defiled!' These people know the stuff of which courtiers are made.|$|E

6000|$|Humanly, {{they were}} more {{concerned}} for the Last Margrave, because of certain qualities which made him the Best Margrave, {{in spite of the}} defects of his qualities. He was the son of the Wild Margrave, equally known in the Ansbach annals, who {{may not have been the}} Worst Margrave, but who had certainly a bad trick of putting his subjects to death without trial, and in cases where there was special haste, with his own hand. He sent his son to the university at Utrecht because he believed that the republican influences in Holland would be wholesome for him, and then he sent him to travel in Italy; but when the boy came home looking frail and sick, the Wild Margrave charged his official travelling companion with neglect, and had the unhappy Hofrath Meyer hanged without process for this crime. One of the gentlemen of his realm, for a pasquinade on the Margrave, was brought to the scaffold; he had, at various times, twenty-two of his soldiers shot with arrows and bullets or hanged for desertion, besides many whose penalties his clemency commuted to the loss of an ear or a nose; a Hungarian who killed his <b>hunting-dog,</b> he had broken alive on the wheel. A soldier's wife was hanged for complicity in a case of desertion; a young soldier who eloped with the girl he loved was brought to Ansbach from a neighboring town, and hanged with her on the same gallows. A sentry at the door of one of the Margrave's castles amiably complied with the Margrave's request to let him take his gun for a moment, on the pretence of wishing to look at it. For this breach of discipline the prince covered him with abuse and gave him over to his hussars, who bound him to a horse's tail and dragged him through the streets; he died of his injuries. The kennel-master who had charge of the Margrave's dogs was accused of neglecting them: without further inquiry the Margrave rode to the man's house and shot him down on his own threshold. A shepherd who met the Margrave on a shying horse did not get his flock out of the way quickly enough; the Margrave demanded the pistols of a gentleman in his company, but he answered that they were not loaded, and the shepherd's life was saved. As they returned home the gentleman fired them off. [...] "What does that mean?" [...] cried the Margrave, furiously. [...] "It means, gracious lord, that you will sleep sweeter tonight, for not having heard my pistols an hour sooner." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was late}} in a drizzly {{afternoon}} that a traveler alighted {{at the door of}} a small country hotel, in the village of N----, in Kentucky. In the barroom he found assembled quite a miscellaneous company, whom stress of weather had driven to harbor, and the place presented the usual scenery of such reunions. Great, tall, raw-boned Kentuckians, attired in hunting-shirts, and trailing their loose joints over a vast extent of territory, with the easy lounge peculiar to the race,--rifles stacked away in the corner, shot-pouches, game-bags, <b>hunting-dogs,</b> and little negroes, all rolled together in the corners,--were the characteristic features in the picture. At each end of the fireplace sat a long-legged gentleman, with his chair tipped back, his hat on his head, and the heels of his muddy boots reposing sublimely on the mantel-piece,--a position, we will inform our readers, decidedly favorable to the turn of reflection incident to western taverns, where travellers exhibit a decided preference for this particular mode of elevating their understandings.|$|R
5000|$|Johann Adam Melsheimer, {{the founder}} of the House of Struthof, was born in Altendambach near Schleusingen in Thuringia. The Thuringian Melsheimers arose from an old Electorate of the Palatinate family of foresters who in 1570 were granted a coat of arms by that state. This was renewed in 1668, and since 1939 it has adorned the Struthof. It shows a hunter with a <b>hunting-dog</b> lead and a hunting horn on the escutcheon, and the same figure forms the crest. In line with family tradition, J.A. Melsheimer chose as his future {{profession}} forester and hunter. On the Electorate of the Palatinate hunting estate of Bruchhausen near Heidelberg he was trained. His first posting was in the Odenwald. Afterwards he came in 1719 as a trained and experienced forester to the Oberamt of Kreuznach and to the Soon (part of the Hunsrück). It is believed that since he was not from this area, but rather from Electorate of the Palatinate, people called him “the hunter from Electorate of the Palatinate (der Jäger aus Kurpfalz), the subject of a now well known folk song. In 1722, Johann Adam Melsheimer acquired for 500 Rhenish guilders a parcel of woodland measuring 75 Prussian Morgen (roughly 19 ha), on one part of which he built his Jägerhof or Försterhof, which he held in Erbbestand. He thus became {{the founder of}} the Struthof. This homestead formerly went by both those other names mentioned just above, and also by the name Melsheimerhof. Melsheimer had special rights that he had been granted by the Electorate of the Palatinate court stewardship, and he bequeathed them to his successors. Among these were the right to transfer his office to his son, the right to fetch firewood from the forest and the right to let his livestock graze in the forest.

40|$|Abstract Objective Braque Français, type Pyrénées is a French <b>hunting-dog</b> breed whose origin is {{traced back}} to old {{pointing}} gun-dogs used to assist hunters in finding and retrieving game. This breed is popular in France, but seldom seen elsewhere. Despite the ancient background, the literature on its genetic characterization is surprisingly scarce. A recent study looked into the demography and inbreeding using pedigree records, but there is yet no report {{on the use of}} molecular markers in this breed. The aim of this work was to genotype a population of Braque Français, type Pyrénées dogs with the high-density SNP array to study the genomic diversity of the breed. Results The average observed (H_O) and expected (H_E) heterozygosity were 0. 371 (± 0. 142) and 0. 359 (± 0. 124). Effective population size (N_e) was 27. 5635 runs of homozygosity (ROH) were identified with average length of 2. 16 MB. A ROH shared by 75 % of the dogs was detected at the beginning of chromosome 22. Inbreeding coefficients from marker genotypes were in the range F_IS=[- 0. 127, 0. 172]. Inbreeding estimated from ROH (F_ROH) had mean 0. 112 (± 0. 023), with range [0. 0526, 0. 225]. These results show that the Braque Français, type Pyrénées breed is a relatively inbred population, but with still sufficient genetic variability for conservation and genetic improvement...|$|E

5000|$|Russian fur trappers, called promyshlenniki, hunted {{in one of}} {{two types}} of bands of 10-15 men, called [...] The first was an {{independent}} band of blood relatives or unrelated people who contributed an equal share of the hunting-expedition expenses; the second was a band of hired hunters who participated in expeditions fully funded by the trading companies which employed them. Members of an independent vataga cooperated and shared all necessary work associated with fur trapping, including making and setting traps, building forts and camps, stockpiling firewood and grain, and fishing. All fur pelts went into a common pool that the band divided equally among themselves after Russian officials exacted the tithing tax. On the other hand, a trading company provided hired fur-trappers with the money needed for transportation, food, and supplies, and once the hunt was finished, the employer received two-thirds of the pelts and the remaining ones were sold and the proceeds divided evenly among the hired laborers. During the summer, promyshlenniki would set up a summer camp to stockpile grain and fish, and many engaged in agricultural work for extra money. During late summer or early fall the vatagi left their hunting grounds, surveyed the area, and set up a winter camp. Each member of the group set at least 10 traps and the vatagi divided into smaller groups of 2 to 3 men who cooperated to maintain certain traps. Promyshlenniki checked traps daily, resetting them or replacing bait whenever necessary. The promyshlenniki employed both passive and active hunting-strategies. The passive approach involved setting traps, while the active approach involved the use of <b>hunting-dogs</b> and of bows-and-arrows. Occasionally, hunters also followed sable tracks to their burrows, around which they placed nets, and waited for the sable to emerge.|$|R

Battle listened, scratching his head, and with a patient, perplexed grin on his face, but he could understand only very little of what Nod meant. For even a Mulla-mulgar, though he can repeat like a child, or like a parrot, by rote, has small brains for really learning another language, so that it may be a telling picture of his thoughts. Indeed, Battle thought that poor Nod had fallen a little crazy with the cold. He fondled him and scratched his head--this Prince of Tishnar--as if he were at his hearth at home, and Nod his country cat. But at least he knew that the little Mulgar wished to leave him, and he made no hindrance except his own sadness to his going. He gave him out of his own pocket a silver groat with a hole in it, and a large piece of fine looking-glass, besides the necklet of clear blue Bamba-beads, and three rings of copper. He gave him, too, one leaf of his little fat book, and in this Nod wrapped his Wonderstone.
