40|$|Toothpastes {{should have}} a minimum {{concentration}} of 1000 ppm of fluoride (F) to control caries and also the active <b>F</b> <b>agent</b> must be chemically free (soluble) in the formulation. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the concentration of soluble F in dentifrices used by 206 Brazilian children. The concentrations of total fluoride (TF), total soluble fluoride (TSF) and fluoride ion were determined. From these analyses, the concentrations of F as sodium monofluorophosphate (MFP) and % of insoluble F were calculated. F was analyzed with an ion specific electrode in duplicates. The majority of dentifrices used (96 %) contained F and in 84 % of them, TF concentration was according to that declared by the manufacturers. In the F-toothpastes, 78 % showed TSF concentration &# 8805; 1000 ppm, varying from 422. 3 to 1432. 3 ppm F (mean ± SD of 1017. 6 ± 239. 4).

40|$|An {{unidentified}} spirochete, {{referred to}} as the 277 <b>F</b> <b>agent,</b> was isolated from Haemaphysalis leporispalustris ticks from two cottontail rabbits by inoculation of the tick suspension into embryonated chicken eggs. Because of its minute width (0. 1 μ), the organism was difficult to see when stained by the Giemsa method, but was readily demonstrated by silver impregnation or fluorescent-antibody procedures. In dark-field microscopy, the spirochetes appeared uniformly and rather tightly coiled, and exhibited typical corkscrewlike motility. After yolk-sac inoculation, the agent was highly lethal for chick embryos and was recovered in large quantity from several embryonic tissues and fluids. It could also be maintained in nonfertile eggs and in an enriched liquid medium. This previously undescribed spirochete could pass through Berkefeld N but not Seitz EK filters. It was relatively resistant to heat and to penicillin or sulfadiazine, but was markedly inhibited by streptomycin, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and homologous neutralizing antiserum. Of several species of animals tested for susceptibility to this spirochete, only the snowshoe hare gave evidence of infection...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{this study}} we used {{cellular}} magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) labeled with a Fluorine- 19 (19 <b>F)</b> <b>agent.</b> 19 F-MRI offers unambiguous detection and in vivo quantification of labeled cells. METHODS: We investigated two common stem cell transplant mouse models: an immune competent, syngeneic transplant model and an immune compromised, xenograft transplant model. 19 F labelled stem cells were implanted intramuscularly into the hindlimb of healthy mice. The transplant was then monitored for up to 17 days using 19 F-MRI, after which the tissue was excised for fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemisty. RESULTS: Immediately following transplantation, 19 F-MRI quantification correlated very well with the expected cell number in both models. The 19 F signal decreased over time in both models, with a more rapid decrease in the syngeneic model. By endpoint, only 2 / 7 syngeneic mice had any detectable 19 F signal. In the xenograft model, all mice had detectable signal at endpoint. Fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry were used {{to show that the}} 19 F signal was related to the presence of bystander labeled macrophages, and not original MSC. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that 19 F-MRI is an excellent tool for verifying the delivery of therapeutic cells early after transplantation. However, in certain circumstances the transfer of cellular label to other bystander cells may confuse interpretation of the long-term fate of the transplanted cells...|$|E

The experiment {{was conducted in}} the greenhouse and field using the same experimental design (randomized block design with two factors) and three replications. The first factor was seed treatments, i. e. negative control, positive control, streptomycin sulphate 0. 2 %, Pseudomonas diminuta + Bacillus subtilis, matriconditioning + streptomycin sulphate 0. 2 %, and matriconditioning + P. diminuta + B. subtilis. Spraying plants (second factor) : untreated control, streptomycin sulphate 0. 2 %, biological <b>agent</b> <b>F</b> 112, biological <b>agent</b> <b>F</b> 198, and biological <b>agent</b> <b>F</b> 57. In the greenhouse, matriconditioning + P. diminuta + B. subtilis  improved seed germination, plant height, and plant dry weight. Spraying plants with biological <b>agent</b> <b>F</b> 112 increased plant dry weight. Meanwhile, matriconditioning + P. diminuta + B. subtilis followed by spraying plants with biological <b>agent</b> <b>F</b> 112 reduced the BLB severity. In the field, matriconditioning + P. diminuta + B. subtilis improved seedling dry weight.

40|$|Monitoring of cell {{therapeutics}} in vivo is {{of major}} importance to estimate its efficacy. Here, {{we present a}} novel intracellular label for (19) F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -based cell tracking, which allows for noninvasive, longitudinal cell tracking {{without the use of}} radioisotopes. A key advantage of (19) F MRI is that it allows for absolute quantification of cell numbers directly from the MRI data. The (19) F label was tested in primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. These cells took up label effectively, resulting in a labeling of 1. 7 +/- 0. 1 x 10 (13) (19) F atoms per cell, with a viability of 80 +/- 6 %, without the need for electroporation or transfection agents. This results in a minimum detection sensitivity of about 2, 000 cells/voxel at 7 T, comparable with gadolinium-labeled cells. Comparison of the detection sensitivity of cells labeled with (19) F, iron oxide and gadolinium over typical tissue background showed that unambiguous detection of the (19) F-labeled cells was simpler than with the contrast agents. The effect of the (19) <b>F</b> <b>agent</b> on cell function was minimal in the context of cell-based vaccines. From these data, we calculate that detection of 30, 000 cells in vivo at 3 T with a reasonable signal to noise ratio for (19) F images would require less than 30 min with a conventional fast spin echo sequence, given a coil similar to the one used in this study. This is well within acceptable limits for clinical studies, and thus, we conclude that (19) F MRI for quantitative cell tracking in a clinical setting has great potential...|$|E

40|$|Medical imaging {{agents that}} can {{report on the}} {{biological}} state are attracting increasing interest. Here we report the development of novel <b>F</b> polymeric imaging <b>agents</b> that are activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The imaging agents composed of thioether- and fluorine-containing methacrylate monomers were synthesised using atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP) from a hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) -based initiator. In aqueous solution, the agents self-assemble into nanoparticles with compact hydrophobic cores. The mobility of the fluorinated segments within the cores is greatly restricted, thereby significantly shortening the F T relaxation times and attenuating the F NMR signal. However, upon treatment with ROS (i. e. HO), the hydrophobic thioether groups of the agents are oxidised to hydrophilic sulfoxide groups, resulting in the disassembly of the aggregated nanoparticles. The disassembly of the <b>F</b> MRI <b>agents</b> lengthens the T relaxation times, and enables an appreciable enhancement of F NMR signal. F MRI of solutions of the polymers before and after oxidation demonstrated a remarkable "OFF-ON" regulation in response to ROS. The sensitivity of the imaging agents was further enhanced by adding a pH switch, resulting in a ROS/pH dual-responsive <b>F</b> MRI <b>agent.</b> The most pronounced change in intensity of the F NMR/MRI signal was achieved {{in response to the}} presence of ROS in a mildly acidic environment.

40|$|A team {{consisting}} {{of an unknown}} number of mobile agents, starting from different nodes of an unknown network, have to meet at the same node. Agents move in synchronous rounds. Each agent has a different label. Up to <b>f</b> of the <b>agents</b> are Byzantine. We consider two levels of Byzantine behavior. A strongly Byzantine agent can choose an arbitrary port when it moves and it can convey arbitrary information to other agents, while a weakly Byzantine agent can do the same, except changing its label. What is the minimum number of good agents that guarantees deterministic gathering of all of them, with termination? We solve exactly this Byzantine gathering problem in arbitrary networks for weakly Byzantine agents, and give approximate solutions for strongly Byzantine agents, both when the size of the network is known and when it is unknown. It turns out that both the strength versus weakness of Byzantine behavior and the knowledge of network size significantly impact the results. For weakly Byzantine agents we show that any number of good agents permit to solve the problem for networks of known size. If the size is unknown, then this minimum number is f + 2. More precisely, we show a deterministic polynomial algorithm that gathers all good agents in an arbitrary network, provided that there are at least f + 2 of them. We also provide a matching lower bound: we prove that if the number of good agents is at most f + 1, then they are not able to gather deterministically with termination in some networks. For strongly Byzantine agents we give a lower bound of f + 1, even when the graph is known: we show that <b>f</b> good <b>agents</b> cannot gather deterministically in the presence of <b>f</b> Byzantine <b>agents</b> even in a ring of known size.
