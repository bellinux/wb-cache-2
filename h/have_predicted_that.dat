5|$|Bioinformatic screens <b>have</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>that</b> over 250 human {{proteins}} contain prion-like domains (PrLD). These domains are {{hypothesized to}} have the same transmissible, amyloidogenic properties of PrP and known fungal proteins. As in yeast, proteins involved in gene expression and RNA binding seem to be particularly enriched in PrLD's, compared to other classes of protein. In particular, 29 of the known 210 proteins with an RNA recognition motif also have a putative prion domain. Meanwhile, several of these RNA-binding proteins have been independently identified as pathogenic in cases of ALS, FTLD-U, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease.|$|E
5|$|As weather {{conditions}} shift due to climate change, bees change their behaviors. When it rains, bees {{do not go}} out and during extremely hot weather they try to gather water to keep the colony cool. Climatologists <b>have</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>that</b> the occurrence of extreme weather events (such as intense rainy seasons and prolonged drought) will increase as the climate continues to change. Additionally, in regions that experience increasingly more rain, pollen will be washed away more easily {{making it more difficult}} for bees to provide for their colonies. Meanwhile, in environments experiencing prolonged drought, flower environments may dwindle with dry weather. These patterns lead to less suitable and viable environments in which bees can thrive. A British journal published projections of plant diversity loss against spatial sensitivity; the researchers found major species loss {{in the southern part of}} the UK forcing bee colonies further north.|$|E

They also believed in 'destiny' and interpreted the fate of the kingdom of England with Biblical and Carolingian ideology, with parallels, between the Israelites, the great European empires and the Anglo-Saxons. Danish and Norman conquests were just the manner in which God punished his sinful people and the fate of great empires.|$|E

500|$|In the United States, {{resistance}} to linezolid has been monitored and tracked since 2004 through a program named LEADER, which (...) {{was conducted in}} 60 medical institutions throughout the country. Resistance has remained stable and extremely low—less than one-half {{of one percent of}} s overall, and less than one-tenth of one percent of S. aureus samples. A similar, worldwide program—the [...] "Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Study", or ZAAPS—has been conducted since 2002. , overall {{resistance to}} linezolid in 23 countries was less than 0.2%, and nonexistent among streptococci. Resistance was only found in Brazil, China, Ireland, and Italy, among coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.28% of samples resistant), enterococci (0.11%), and S. aureus (0.03%). In the United Kingdom and Ireland, no resistance was found in staphylococci collected from bacteremia cases between 2001 and 2006, although resistance in enterococci has been reported.

500|$|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 (2010) was {{released}} in November and made over US$950million. It set several box office records and opened to mostly favourable reviews in the media. His portrayal of Ron again earned him critical praise. Reviewing the adaption in Slate, Dana Stevens called {{all three of the}} leads [...] "terrific." [...] Despite giving Deathly Hallows – Part 1 a negative rating, Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal publication stated [...] "Grint has grown up to be a skilful actor who knows the value of a slow burn". New York Post writer Lou Lumenick, however, observed that both Grint and Radcliffe had grown weary of playing the same characters and expressed it in their performances. Grint's performance scored him nominations from the MTV Movie Awards and National Movie Awards for Best Fight and Performance of the Year in 2011. Grint reprised his role for the eighth time, in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, the last Harry Potter instalment. This film picked-up from where the previous film left-off and included a lot of action, whereas the first part had focused more on character development. Rupert, along with the film, was critically acclaimed: Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post asked, [...] "Who could <b>have</b> <b>predicted</b> <b>that</b> Radcliffe, Grint and Watson {{would turn out to be}} good actors?". The film broke several box office records, including biggest midnight release, biggest first-day opening, and biggest opening-weekend. Deathly Hallows – Part 2 got up to the 4th highest-grossing film of all time, and is the second highest-grossing non-James Cameron film with more than US$1.3 billion worldwide (behind The Avengers).|$|E
500|$|On the October 31, 2007 {{episode of}} the reality show Phenomenon, Paranormalist Jim Callahan {{performed}} a summoning, purportedly of author Raymond Hill, to help discover {{the contents of a}} locked box.

Angel has since revealed the contents of one envelope and at the unveiling he challenged Geller one more time. Geller responded, [...] "Although we were born one day apart - I was born on the 20th of December and you on the 19th - a lot of years between us - 40 years, you were one year old when I came out with my spoon bending..." [...] Criss Angel cut him off at this point, saying, [...] "I guess this is a 'no,'" [...] and proceeded to open the envelope.
