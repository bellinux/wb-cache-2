Due to ineffective mechanisms for limiting corruption, the 2001-2 NFFWP in AP was a failure. It was recommended that the checks and controls must be built into the design of such programmes.

40|$|The {{research}} was conducted in Enderta Woreda, in southern zone of Tigray National Regional State, to assess the beneficiaries’ perception {{on the role of}} <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> and to review and assess the discouragement effect. During the study, primary data were collected from 120 members of a multi purpose cooperative and 30 non members. In addition secondary data were collected from the relevant institutions. For the data analysis, descriptive statistics such as frequency distribution and percentages were used to describe institutional and socio-economic characteristics of the respondents. In addition, the t and Chi-square tests were employed to test the relationship of dependent variables with respect to some explanatory variables. A Multiple regression model was used to analyze factors influencing average annual income of respondents. The study revealed that the FFW beneficiaries have better access to food and their availability to food was also improved. The nutritional status has improved due to their participation in the project. FFW projects have also protected from migration for the 98. 6 % of the respondents. Moreover, it helped 88. 4 % of the respondents to enroll more children in schools. Besides, the study findings indicate that the only source of income {{for the majority of the}} respondents was farming.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{programs}} implemented in selected countries {{to protect the}} poor during normal times and during transition or adjustment. In particular, two questions are addressed: how have countries implemented the programs in practice, {{and what are the}} lessons. The paper reviews five sets of programs: (i) food subsidies and related interventions, (ii) <b>food</b> <b>for</b> <b>works</b> and other public works programs, (iii) credit-based self-employment programs, (iv) social funds and related interventions, and (v) child allowances. More representative than comprehensive, the selection of programs and countries is based on the availability of rigorous evaluations, the importance of the program, and the issue under consideration. In choosing between the instruments and their duration and coverage, governments face key issues, including how much to spend and how to finance programs; how to target assistance to the poor, within politically feasible limits; how to select the most appropriate delivery mechanism; and how to avoid adverse effects on incentives for labor supply and private savings and transfers. The reviewed program and country experience offers a few key lessons. First, it i...|$|R
