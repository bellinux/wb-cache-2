40|$|A {{workholding}} fixture should {{ensure a}} stable and precise positioning of the workpiece {{with respect to the}} machine tool. This requirement is even more important when modular fixtures are used for the sake of efficiency and configurability. They include standard locating elements, which set the part in a predefined spatial orientation by contacting its <b>datum</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In the computer-based design of a fixture, the layout of locators must be tested against two main sources of problems. Kinematic analysis verifies that any relative motion between the part and the worktable is constrained. Tolerance analysis evaluates the robustness of part orientation with respect to manufacturing errors on <b>datum</b> <b>surfaces.</b> We propose a method to carry out both tests through a common set of geometric parameters of the fixture configuration. These derive from the singular value decomposition of the matrix that represents positioning constraints in screw coordinates. For a poorly designed fixture, the decomposition allows us to find out either unconstrained degrees of freedom of the part or a possible violation of tolerance specifications on machined features due to geometric errors on <b>datum</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In such cases, the analysis provides suggestions to plan the needed corrections to the locating scheme.

40|$|Abstract – Levelling in {{surveying}} is {{the term}} stand for height difference determination between ground points. If a <b>datum</b> <b>surface</b> is defined for the observed points, the heights of these points (reduced levels) can be computed. In ordinary orthometric levelling Geoid surface is usually used as a datum. Levelling process {{can be carried out}} using different survey equipments and techniques. It may be precise; when precise optical or digital levels are used, or it may be ordinary; when using ordinary optical, automatic or digital levels. Moreover it can be carried out trigonometrically or barometrically. Now a day Global Positioning System (GPS) provides a quick modern technology to determine heights of points. But here, the <b>datum</b> <b>surface</b> is already defined with ellipsoidal surface. Therefore, different reduced levels can be expected compared with orthometric leveling. In this research work, difference in heights between numbers of points, in Khartoum State (Sudan), were carried out using both ordinary orthometric levelling (in which geoid is the reference datum) and GPS techniques (in which ellipsoid is the reference datum). Results obtained showed that the accuracy in levelling for GPS data in levelling for height differences is better than the accuracy of orthometric height determination. Therefore, GPS can be used in many engineering applications when variation in height is the main target. This result leads to ability of GPS to produce grid vector map at scale 1 : 5, 000 and smaller. Moreover, GPS data can be reduced to a new arbitrary datum so that contour maps at scale 1 : 5, 000 and smaller can be plotted...|$|E

Ten replicates of a purpose-designed part were produced using a three-dimensional printer, and measurements of {{the internal and external}} features of all surfaces were made using a general purpose coordinate measuring machine. The results reveal that the bases of all replicates (nominally flat) have a concave curvature, producing a flatness error of the primary datum. This is in contrast to findings regarding other three-dimensional printing processes, widely reported in the literature, where a convex curvature was observed.

On the other hand, constraints imposed by the available machining axes accuracy capabilities (i. e. accuracy of the available machine tools for the particular job) and the always present minimum machining cost requirement cannot be readily incorporated into the relevant considerations. In mechanical design, dimensional chains are frequent and observation of the specified tolerances - {{in conjunction with the}} geometrical ones - guarantees the part functionality.

40|$|One of {{the steps}} in the {{reduction}} of seismic data is the correction for variations in surface elevation. This requires {{the adoption of a}} common reference surface, usually known as the seismic datum, but also referred to as the floating datum, the undulated or warped datum, or the datum plane. Ideally, the seismic datum should parallel the velocity layers, and in that sense it is an isovelocity surface; in practice, the datum is more often a surface of convenience. In its simplest form, the datum is a horizontal plane, but commonly it is undulated to conform to the generalized topography. While the warping of a <b>datum</b> <b>surface</b> serves to simplify and minimize the elevation corrections, it is usually done in the knowledge that the isovelocity surfaces are often similarly undulated. Such undulations of the velocity layers are generally attributed to the variations in loading caused by the irregularity of the ground surface. In an attempt to develop an objective means of constructing a satisfactory universal seismic datum, a zone chart was designed, similar to the terrain-correction zone chart employed in gravity reductions. The compart-mented transparent disk, superimposed on a topographic map and centered over the shotpoint, permits the calcula-tion of a properly weighted, or “normalized, ” elevation which serves {{as the basis for the}} undulated seismic datum. Tests of the resulting datum indicate that it will normally compensate adequately for velocity variations due to topographic loading and, consequently, insure a more accurate interpretation of the seismic data...|$|E

40|$|In {{geodetic}} applications, {{three different}} surfaces or earth figures are normally involved. In {{addition to the}} earth's natural or physical surface, these include a geometric or mathematical figure of the earth taken to be an equipotential ellipsoid of revolution (Chapter 3), and a second equipotential surface or figure of the earth, the geoid. The geoid is defined as that particular equipotential {{surface of the earth}} that coincides with mean sea level over the oceans and extends hypothetically beneath all land surfaces. In a mathematical sense, the geoid is also defined as so many meters above (+N) or below (-N) the ellipsoid (Figure 6. 1). In Figure 6. 1 and in subsequent figures and equations, the difference n direction between the geodetic normal and the vertical is ignored due to its insignificance to the topic discussed here. The first definit on of the geoid has great practical importance since it refers to the hypothetical extension of mean sea level (the geoid) beneath land surfaces. In this capacity, the geoid serves not only as the vertical <b>datum</b> (reference <b>surface)</b> for height-above-mean sea level (h) values in areas where elevation data is not available from conventional leveling, but is fundamental to the determination of the h-values themselves. This is apparent from the Equationsand Figures 6. 2 and 6. 3, where: H = geodetic height = height above the ellipsoid* N = geoid height h = height-above-mean sea level, Figures 6. 2 and 6. 3 illustrate the use of geoid heights in the determination of h-values from geodetic heights derived using satellite receivers (e. g., NAVSTAR GPS receivers) located on the earth's physical surface and aboard a vehicle operating near the earth (or in space), respectively. In particular, {{it is easy to see}} from Figure 6. 2 how geoid heights (N) position the geoid with respect to the ellipsoid where the former can then serve as the vertical datum for the height-above-mean sea level values which the N-values also helped determine. It is hard to over-estimate the importance of the geoid in this dual role. In some parts of the world, the elevation data appearing on maps and charts was obtained via this geoid-related approach. In land areas where heights-above-mean sea level are available from conventional leveling, the geoid, as determined herein, is not needed as the vertical <b>datum</b> (reference <b>surface)</b> for these h-values...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{history of}} the {{peneplain}} in East Sayan was studied using apatite fission-track analysis (AFTA). This method is suitable for determining the formation time of the erosional surface and estimating its denudation rate. The largest known relic of the peneplanation surface {{in this area is}} the Oka Plateau, separated from the Kropotkin Ridge by the Oka-Jombolok fault. The AFTA shows that the peneplain on the Oka Plateau formed in the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous. This peneplain is much younger than the erosional surfaces that persist today in the Tien Shan, Gobi Altai, and Mongolian Altai (Early Jurassic). However, it is older than the peneplain on the Chulyshman Plateau, Altai (Late Cretaceous), suggesting asynchronous formation of the ancient peneplain in Central Asia. The similar exhumation histories of samples from the Oka Plateau and Kropotkin Ridge indicate that these morphotectonic structures developed from Jurassic to late Miocene as a single block, which underwent continuous slow denudation at an average rate of 0. 0175 mm/yr. Active tectonic processes in the Late Miocene caused the destruction of the peneplanation surface and its partial uplifting to different altitudes. The rate of Pliocene-Quaternary vertical movements along the Oka-Jombolok fault is roughly estimated at 0. 046 - 0. 080 mm/yr, which is several times higher than the denudation rate in this area.

40|$|An {{enhanced}} alignment cube {{has been}} invented {{for use in}} a confined setting (e. g., a cryogenic chamber) in which optical access may be limited to a single line of sight. Whereas traditional alignment-cube practice entails the use of two theodolites aimed along two lines of sight, the enhanced alignment cube yields complete alignment information through use of a single theodolite aimed along a single line of sight. Typically, an alignment cube is placed in contact with a <b>datum</b> <b>surface</b> or other reference feature on a scientific instrument during assembly or testing of the instrument. The alignment cube is then used in measuring a small angular deviation of the feature from a precise required orientation. Commonly, the deviation is expressed in terms of rotations (Rx,Ry,Rz) of the cube about the corresponding Cartesian axes (x,y,z). In traditional practice, in order to measure all three rotations, it is necessary to use two theodolites aimed at two orthogonal faces of the alignment cube, as shown in {{the upper part of the}} figure. To be able to perform such a measurement, one needs optical access to these two faces. In the case of an alignment cube inside a cryogenic chamber or other enclosed space, the optical-access requirement translates to a requirement for two windows located along the corresponding two orthogonal lines of sight into the chamber. In a typical application, it is difficult or impossible to provide two windows. The present enhanced version of the alignment cube makes it possible to measure all three rotations by use of a single line of sight, thereby obviating a second window...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to calculate volume of tailing underwater sediments and liquid industrial wastes on the basis of innovative technologies. Two theodolites which are set at various points and a boat with a load for measuring water depth have been traditionally used for topographic survey of slime storage bottom. Horizontal directions have been simultaneously measured on the boat marker while using theodolites. Water depth has been determined while using  a 2 -kg circular load which was descended into brine solution with the help of rope. In addition to rather large time and labour costs such technology has required synchronization in actions on three participants involved in the work: operators of two theodolites and boat team in every depth measuring point. Methodology has been proposed for more efficient solution of the problem. It presupposes the use of echolocation together with space localization systems (GPS-systems) which can be set on a boat with the purpose to measure depth of a storage tank bed. An echolocation transducer has been installed under the boat bottom at the depth of 10 cm from the brine solution level in the slime storage.   An aerial of GPS-receiver has been fixed over the echo-sounder transducer. Horizontal positioning of bottom depth measuring points have been carried out in the local coordinate system.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Experimental mechanics is currently contemplating tremendous opportunities of further advancements thanks {{to a combination of}} powerful computational techniques and also fullfield non-contact methods to measure displacement and strain fields {{in a wide variety of}} materials. Identification techniques, aimed to evaluate material mechanical properties given known loads and measured displacement or strain fields, are bound to benefit from increased data availability (both in density and dimensionality) and efficient inversion methods such as finite element updating (FEU) and the virtual fields method (VFM). They work at their best when provided with dense and multicomponent experimental displacement (or strain) data, i. e. when all orthogonal components of displacements (or all components of the strain tensor) are known at points closely spaced within the volume of the material under study. Although a very challenging requirement, an increasing number of techniques are emerging to provide such data. In this Thesis, a novel wavelength scanning interferometry (WSI) system that provides three dimensional (3 -D) displacement fields inside the volume of semi-transparent scattering materials is proposed. Sequences of two-dimensional interferograms are recorded whilst tuning the frequency of a laser at a constant rate. A new approach based on frequency multiplexing is used to encode the interference signal corresponding to multiple illumination directions at different spectral bands. Different optical paths along each illumination direction ensure that the signals corresponding to each sensitivity vector do not overlap in the frequency domain. All the information required to reconstruct the location and the 3 -D displacement vector of scattering points within the material is thus recorded simultaneously in a single wavelength scan. By comparing phase data volumes obtained for two successive scans, all orthogonal components of the three dimensional displacement field introduced between scans (e. g. by means of loading or moving the sample under study) are readily obtained with high displacement sensitivity. The fundamental principle that describes the technique is presented in detail, including the correspondence between interference signal frequency and its associated depth within the sample, depth range, depth resolution, transverse resolution and displacement sensitivity. Data processing of the interference signal includes Fourier transformation, noise reduction, re-registration of data volumes, measurement of the illumination and sensitivity vectors from experimental data using a <b>datum</b> <b>surface,</b> phase difference evaluation, 3 -D phase unwrapping and 3 -D displacement field evaluation. Experiments consisting of controlled rigid body rotations and translations of a phantom were performed to validate the results. Both in-plane and the out-of-plane displacement components were measured for each voxel in the resulting data volume, showing an excellent agreement with the expected 3 -D displacement...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} alignment {{method is}} commonly used in many industries today because it is cheaper and easier to operate than other alignment methods. However, very little systematic research and study has been conducted in this area so far, {{and there are still}} some fundamental questions which remain unanswered. In this thesis, we investigated the precision level and established the baseline achieved by a mechanical alignment system using <b>datums</b> and reference <b>surfaces.</b> The factors which affect the accuracy of mechanical alignment system were studied and methodology was developed to suppress these factors so as to reach its full potential precision. In order to characterize the mechanical alignment system quantitatively, a new optical position monitoring system by using quadrant detectors has been developed in this thesis, it can monitor multi-dimensional degrees of mechanical workpieces in real time with high precision, which conventional measurement methods (such as interferometer) can not realize. We studied the noise factors inside the system and optimized the optical system. Based on the fact that one of the major limiting noise factors is the shifting of the laser beam, a noise cancellation technique has been developed successfully to suppress this noise, the feasibility of an ultra high resolution (< 20 angstrom) for displacement monitoring has been demonstrated. Using the optical position monitoring system, repeatability experiment of the mechanical alignment system has been conducted on different kinds of samples including steel, aluminum, glass and plastics with the same size 100 mmx 130 mm. The alignment accuracy was studied quantitatively rather than qualitatively before. In a controlled environment, we found that common practice of preparation of datum by insertion of precision machined rod into tightly fitted hole may not be adequate. The alignment precision can be improved 5 folds by securing the datum without other means of help. The roughness of reference surface of the samples can affect the alignment precision, the alignment accuracy of an aluminum workpiece having reference surface by milling is about 3 times better than by shearing. Also we have found that sample material can have fairly significant effect on the alignment precision of the system. Contamination trapped between the <b>datum</b> and reference <b>surfaces</b> in mechanical alignment system can cause errors of registration or reduce the level of manufacturing precision. In comparison with the results in a controlled environment above, we {{want to find out what}} will happen in the practice of industries where there is contamination and how much room there is in the system accuracy for improvement. In the thesis, artificial and natural dust particles were used to simulate the real situations and their effects on system precision have been investigated. In this experiment, we discovered two effective cleaning processes, one is the self-cleaning process, and another is the cleaning method by an air gun and a vacuum cleaner which is more efficient. We also studied how other factors (surface roughness, sample material) interacted with different types of contamination, and found that dust particles had less effect on the steel sample than on other samples...|$|R
40|$|The Vertical Offshore Reference Frame (VORF) is a {{model of}} various {{vertical}} <b>datums</b> as continuous <b>surfaces</b> relative to ETRF 89 that covers all the navigable waters of Great Britain and Ireland. The intended accuracy of the model was to determine the vertical datums of LAT, MLWS, MSL and CD to within 0. 100 m in near-shore areas and 0. 150 m in offshore areas bringing significant advantages to future hydrographic applications. Validation of the model to date has shown that it is fit for purpose under caveats that: advise caution in its use thereby limiting the liability of the UKHO; recommend the model is monitored and updated when new data is available; suggest documentation outlining a suitable method for testing the model is made available. The aim of this dissertation was to investigate a suitable, robust and repeatable methodology for validating the VORF transformation model. A methodology was developed after thorough investigation of vertical reference surfaces, the methods used to create VORF, the tests carried out to date and the available technology. The methodology required performing a harmonic tidal analysis on tidal data collected with a sub-sea pressure gauge positioned relative to ETRF 89. Vertical positioning was achieved by simultaneously recording both the depth of water over the gauge and the height of the water surface from a fixed surface radar gauge. These values were deducted from the ETRF 89 height of the radar gauge which had been established by means of a short levelling connection to a GPS base station. To authenticate this methodology it was implemented at two locations in the SW of England; Polperro and Brixham. This investigation showed that the methodology {{has the potential to be}} used for identifying anomalies in the VORF transformation model; however divergence between the curves observed simultaneously by the two tide gauges rendered the determination of the ellipsoidal height of the sub-sea pressure gauge uncertain and the findings of this dissertation inconclusive...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study {{presented}} here is to establish a finite element (FE) model to simulate the wear process of a polymer-to-polymer sliding system. Two polymer components which are named as "slider" and "ground" are operated on the slant-horizontal contact region reciprocally. A total of 3500 cycles was conducted. The sliding wear motion of the real product is simplified into a two-dimensional model for FE simulation. According to the requirement of the actual application, we are interested in one of effects of the wear performance - the horizontal driving force (HDF) which is applied on the "slider" component to generate the sliding motion [1]. Two commercial polymer materials have been considered in this paper: 33 % glass reinforced, heat stabilised black nylon copolymer resin and BK 15945 % glass reinforced modified polyethylene terephthalate. For the solution of the wear simulation and prediction, the FE analysis software ANSYS and some mathematic wear equations have been used to build an analysis procedure for this polymer contact structure. First, the FE simulation model is applied to gain the contact surface pressure distribution. Then, the mathematical wear equations are used to calculate the wear depth along the wear sliding surface. Next, the contact surface shape with the wear depth datum is modified. Now, a new model with the upgraded geometry is carried out. Repeating the above four analysis steps, the whole wear process will be represented in the simulation model. In this paper, a series of simulations are performed for every 500 operating cycles for a total of 3500 cycles. The major task of ANSYS is to plot the stress and pressure distribution of the fields of contact and the HDF variation with the sliding motion. Both components have been map-meshed and the two-dimensional structure solid element which is designed as PLANE 42 in ANSYS is used for the solid body of the model. The contact pair is described by the flexible surface-to-surface contact elements CONTAC 172 and the flexible surface-to-surface target element TARGE 169. Twenty load steps across the contact surface are setup for gathering the necessary <b>datum</b> (stress, <b>surface</b> pressure, reaction force, etc). To get a better convergence of the iterative solution, two treatments are also configured. First, the calculation algorithm the pure penalty is switched to the augmented Lagrange. Second, the contact stiffness parameter is adjusted to balance the precise result and the acceptable convergence. Furthermore, an approximate method is introduced to simplify the contact geometry of the upgraded model which is generated by applying the wear depth to the original model. Wear equations employed in this paper are proposed by Archard [2] and Yang [3]. The Archard's equation considers the wear in a steady-state and Yang's equation involves the running-in (transient) wear phase. Both of them based on metal materials and have been extended for the application of polymer materials by Ashraf [4]. A number of simulation results are obtained from a sequence of finite element analyses by progressively removing material and are compared with physical testing results. The simulation results of the horizontal force in an operation cycle of 3500, shows that the force increasing along the slant sliding surface and the position where the peak force occurred are very similar to the experiment. The plot of the von-Mises stress distribution from the FE simulation indicates the maximum stress appears {{at the top of the}} slant contact surface. Therefore the maximum wear depth should occur at this region. The variation of the peak horizontal force during the 3500 wear cycles demonstrate a dramatic reduction in peak force over the first 1500 cycles, followed by a gradual decrease in the rate of reduction. For subsequent cycles, the force has decreased continually but at a slower rate. It is found that the FE results have the similar trend with the experimental measured results which support the possibility of using the approximate FE simulation model to estimate the wear process in this particular structure. There are several ways to gain more accurate results. First, refine the model mesh and the load steps. Second, abandon the approximate method which is used to simplify the contact surface after wear. It makes the simulation condition more similar to the actual wear status than the approximate model. Third, apply FE simulation for more wear operation cycles. Due to the model simplifications and the input data of the material properties, this simulation model is only effective for this particular product. Further research will be carried out to extend it to more general the application...|$|R
