5|$|Critics of {{the policy}} of {{economic}} liberalization pursued during the Menem Presidency argued that Argentina's economic woes were caused by neoliberalism, which had been actively promoted by the U.S. government and the IMF under the Washington Consensus. Others have stressed that the main shortcoming of economic policy-making during the 1990s was that economic reform was not pursued with enough determination. A 2004 report by the IMF's <b>Independent</b> <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Office</b> criticised the IMF's conduct prior to Argentina's economic collapse of 2001, saying the IMF had supported the country's fixed exchange rate for too long, and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits.|$|E
500|$|There {{has been}} {{substantial}} criticism over the austerity measures implemented by most European nations to counter this debt crisis. US economist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman argues that an abrupt return to [...] "'non-Keynesian' financial policies" [...] {{is not a}} viable solution. Pointing at historical evidence, he predicts that deflationary policies now being imposed on countries such as Greece and Spain will prolong and deepen their recessions. Together with over 9,000 signatories of [...] "A Manifesto for Economic Sense" [...] Krugman also dismissed the belief of austerity focusing policy makers such as EU economic commissioner Olli Rehn and most European finance ministers that [...] "budget consolidation" [...] revives confidence in financial markets over the longer haul. In a 2003 study that analysed 133 IMF austerity programmes, the IMF's <b>independent</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>office</b> found that policy makers consistently underestimated the disastrous effects of rigid spending cuts on economic growth. In early 2012 an IMF official, who negotiated Greek austerity measures, admitted that spending cuts were harming Greece. In October 2012, the IMF said that its forecasts for countries which implemented austerity programmes have been consistently overoptimistic, suggesting that tax hikes and spending cuts have been doing more damage than expected, and countries which implemented fiscal stimulus, such as Germany and Austria, did better than expected. Also Portugal did comparably better than Spain. The latter introduced drastic austerity measures but was unable not meet its EU budget deficit targets. On the other hand, Portugal's leftist coalition fought austerity (it increased the minimum wage by 25 percent and took back cuts in the pension system and the public sector) {{and at the same}} time reduced its budget deficit to below three percent in 2016. According to historian Florian Schui from University of St. Gallen no austerity program has ever worked. Schui particularly notes Winston Churchill's attempt in 1925 and Heinrich Brüning's attempt in 1930 during the Weimar Republic. Both led to disastrous consequences.|$|E

40|$|On some issues, the <b>Independent</b> <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Office’s</b> {{methodology}} for investigating the IMF’s {{handling of the}} capital account crises of 1997 - 99 could include reviewing the empirical literature that has developed. But on many important issues, econometrics will not help. Thus I foresee that the investigation will include interviewing participants and observers. It will be like the police detective who goes around interviewing witnesses who have already had to tell what they know to ten law enforcement agents before. Some ground is already very well-trod, such as the endless debate over exchange rate regimes. I would urge concentrating on the interesting questions, where some resolution of facts may be possible. Collecting votes regarding the propositions “The IMF is guilty ” or “The IMF did the best it could ” is not in itself interesting, especially not without some additional conclusions about the alternatives. There are three levels of sophistication in public evaluations of the IMF (or, for that matter, of other government agencies). The least sophisticated, but unfortunately very common, is simply to give an overall rating – usually quite a negative one, based on {{the severity of the}} crises [...] without specifying the nature of the mistakes that were made o...|$|R
