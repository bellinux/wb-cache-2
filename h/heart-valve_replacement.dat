50|$|During {{the crash}} Rebecca had finally {{undergone}} <b>heart-valve</b> <b>replacement</b> to correct her heart problem and seemingly made a full recovery. Rachel and Ramona visited her, and Ramona admitted her attraction to Johnny. After Nick misplaced Lucy, Ramona {{used it as}} an excuse to dump Nick and finally get together with Johnny, horrifying Nick and their friends.|$|E
5000|$|Daoud Hanania {{performed}} the first open-heart surgery procedure in Jordan in 1970, the first <b>heart-valve</b> <b>replacement</b> {{in the country}} in 1972 as well as the first kidney transplant in the Arab world in the same year and the first coronary artery bypass in Jordan in 1973 and in Iraq some years later. But his most important achievement came in 1985 after performing the first ever successful cardiac transplant in the Middle East and the Arab world at the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman, Jordan.|$|E
5000|$|June died in Nashville, Tennessee, on May 15, 2003, at 73 years old, of {{complications}} following <b>heart-valve</b> <b>replacement</b> surgery, {{in the company}} of her family and her husband of 35 years, Johnny Cash. At Carter's funeral, her stepdaughter, Rosanne Cash, stated, [...] "if being a wife were a corporation, June would have been a CEO. It was her most treasured role." [...] Johnny died four months after June's death, and her daughter, Rosie Nix Adams, a month after that. Johnny and June (along with Rosie) are buried in Hendersonville Memory Gardens near their home in Hendersonville, Tennessee.|$|E
2500|$|At 17, he won {{an award}} in a {{national}} science competition for research on {{the damage done to}} red blood cells in patients with <b>heart-valve</b> <b>replacements.</b> [...] He attended the University of Michigan in a program that allowed him to earn both his undergraduate degree and his medical degree in 6 years. [...] He received his M.D. degree from the University of Michigan Medical School in 1981.|$|R
40|$|Inconsistent {{associations}} with warfarin dose {{were observed in}} genetic variants except VKORC 1 haplotype and CYP 2 C 9 * 3 in Chinese people, and few studies on warfarin dose algorithm was performed in a large Chinese Han population lived in Northern China. Of 787 consenting patients with <b>heart-valve</b> <b>replacements</b> who were receiving long-term warfarin maintenance therapy, 20 related Single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped. Only VKORC 1 and CYP 2 C 9 SNPs were observed to be significantly associated with warfarin dose. In the derivation cohort (n = 551), warfarin dose variability was influenced, in decreasing order, by VKORC 1 rs 7294 (27. 3 %), CYP 2 C 9 * 3 (7. 0 %), body surface area(4. 2 %), age(2. 7 %), target INR(1. 4 %), CYP 4 F 2 rs 2108622 (0. 7 %), amiodarone use(0. 6 %), diabetes mellitus(0. 6 %), and digoxin use(0. 5 %), which account for 45. 1 % of the warfarin dose variability. In the validation cohort (n = 236), the actual maintenance dose was significantly correlated with predicted dose (r = 0. 609, P, 0. 001). Our algorithm could improve the personalized management of warfarin use in Northern Chinese patients...|$|R
40|$|A Monte Carlo {{uncertainty}} {{analysis with}} correlations between parameters {{is applied to}} a Markov-chain model {{that is used to}} support the choice of a <b>replacement</b> <b>heart-valve.</b> The objective is to quantify the effects of uncertainty in and of correlations between probabilities of valve-related events on the life expectancies of four valve types. The uncertainty in the logit- and log-transformed parameters&mdash;mostly representing proba-bilities and durations&mdash;is modeled as a multivariate normal distribution. The univariate distributions are obtained through values for the median and the 0. 975 quantile of each parameter. Correlations between parameters are difficult to quantify. A sensitivity anal-ysis is suggested to study their influences on the uncertainty in valve preference prior to further elicitation efforts. The results of the uncertainty analysis strengthen the con-clusions from a preceding study, which did not include uncertainty in the model param-eters, where the homograft {{turned out to be the}} best choice. It is concluded that the influence of correlations is limited in most cases. Preference statements become more certain when the correlation between valve types increases. Key words: uncertainty analysis; decision analysis; Monte Carlo simulation; Markov-chain; aortic valve. (Me...|$|R
5000|$|Greg's {{involvement}} with Sahira {{continued to be}} explored on-screen. Their first kiss results {{in a period of}} estrangement as they both feel it wrong to begin an affair. Greg is tasked with saving the life of a patient in need of a difficult <b>heart-valve</b> <b>replacement.</b> He then has to ask for Sahira to assist him in theatre as it is not a procedure he can undertake alone. Writers played them working well together and their working relationship was allowed to resume. Holby City writers continued to develop their relationship during January 2012, producing a significant change in their dynamic. When Sahira is called away from the hospital and a fatal car accident is reported, Greg fears that Sahira is dead. An Inside Soap reporter described Greg being in a state of despair worrying she is dead. But his [...] "despair turns to relief" [...] when he manages to locate Sahira. Greg reacts by kissing Sahira but she shocks him by announcing her intention to leave the hospital. Of the on/off relationship MacLiam explained [...] "I think Sahira’s in denial and she has to suppress what she feels about him. She’s just trying to block those feelings out." ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in modern technology 1 expertise and surgical enterprise hove {{contributed to the}} solution of may problems {{in the field of}} cardiovascular and thoracic surgery. Among these the surgical treatment of heart-valvedysfunctionby valve replacement has become possible (Murray, 1956; Ross, 1962; Starr and Edwards, 1961; Barrett-Boyes, 1964). Today transplantation of valves is an accepted surgical treatment next to corrective valve surgery and conservative therapy in the management of heart-valve disease. <b>Heart-valve</b> <b>replacement</b> becomes a necessity in case of congenital or aquired stenosis or insufficiency, if conservative treatment cannot prevent a progression of the lesions. In the decision for valve replacement the degree of invalidity experienced by ti-e patient is a major factor together with myocardial performance, No valve currently available for valve replacement fulfils the criteria for an ideal valve...|$|E
