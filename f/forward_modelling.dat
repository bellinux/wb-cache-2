50|$|A {{synthetic}} seismogram is {{the result}} of <b>forward</b> <b>modelling</b> the seismic response of an input earth model, which is defined in terms of 1D, 2D or 3D variations in physical properties. In hydrocarbon exploration this is used to provide a 'tie' between changes in rock properties in a borehole and seismic reflection data at the same location. It can also be used either to test possible interpretation models for 2D and 3D seismic data or to model the response of the predicted geology as an aid to planning a seismic reflection survey. In the processing of wide-angle reflection and refraction (WARR) data, synthetic seismograms are used to further constrain the results of seismic tomography. In earthquake seismology, synthetic seismograms are used either to match the predicted effects of a particular earthquake source fault model with observed seismometer records or to help constrain the Earth's velocity structure. Synthetic seismograms are generated using specialized geophysical software.|$|E

50|$|<b>Forward</b> <b>models</b> are a {{predictive}} {{internal model}} of motor control {{that takes the}} available perceptual information, combined with a particular motor program, and tries to predict {{the outcome of the}} planned motor movement. <b>Forward</b> <b>models</b> structure action by determining how the forces, velocities, and positions of motor components affect changes in the environment and in the individual. It is proposed that <b>forward</b> <b>models</b> help with the Neural control of limb stiffness when individuals interact with their environment. <b>Forward</b> <b>models</b> are thought to use motor programs as input to predict the outcome of an action. An error signal is generated when the predictions made by a <b>forward</b> <b>model</b> do not match the actual outcome of the movement, prompting an update of an existing model and providing a mechanism for learning. These models explain why it is impossible to tickle yourself. A sensation is experienced as ticklish when it is unpredictable. However, <b>forward</b> <b>models</b> predict the outcome of your motor movements, meaning the motion is predictable, and therefore not ticklish.|$|R

The <b>forward</b> <b>model</b> is {{an important component of the}} TES retrieval model, the Earth Limb and Nadir Operational Retrieval (ELANOR), as it governs the accuracy and speed of the calculations for the retrievals.

40|$|Seismic <b>forward</b> <b>modelling</b> {{is used to}} {{simulate}} seismic wave propagation in the subsurface. Common modelling techniques include methods such as the ray-Born approximation and the finite difference method. In this thesis I present a comparison between the ray-Born approximation and the finite difference method. This comparison consists of computing synthetic seismograms using both methods for several seismic velocity models and performing a comparison between them. The main motivation for this comparison is {{to see if the}} ray-Born approximation, which is known to be faster, provides enough accuracy to provide an efficient alternative to the finite difference method. The ray-Born approximation was found to be sufficiently accurate in cases where the velocity model did not have large velocity contrasts and multipathing did not occur. In those cases the method can replace the finite difference method in <b>forward</b> <b>modelling</b> algorithms. Full waveform inversion is a technique that is used to compute a model of the subsurface given the seismic data recorded at the surface. In order to perform full waveform inversion, <b>forward</b> <b>modelling</b> is an obvious requirement. Traditional full waveform inversion algorithms use the finite difference method to perform <b>forward</b> <b>modelling</b> and the cost of the computation is therefore high. In order to reduce the cost of the inversion, a full waveform inversion algorithm that uses the ray-Born approximation instead of the finite difference method has been developed. The results from the full waveform inversion when using the ray-Born approximation show {{that it is possible to}} achieve an accurate reproduction of the subsurface at a greatly reduced cost compared to the finite difference method. The ray-Born approximation is therefore evaluated to be a method that can replace the finite difference method both in <b>forward</b> <b>modelling</b> and in full waveform inversion algorithms...|$|E

40|$|Predictive coding {{appears to}} be one of the {{fundamental}} working principles of brain processing. Amongst other aspects, brains often predict the sensory consequences of their own actions. Predictive coding resembles Kalman filtering, where incoming sensory information is filtered to produce prediction errors for subsequent adaptation and learning. However, to generate prediction errors given motor commands, a suitable temporal <b>forward</b> <b>model</b> is required to generate predictions. While in engineering applications, it is usually assumed that this <b>forward</b> <b>model</b> is known, the brain has to learn it. When filtering sensory input and learning from the residual signal in parallel, a fundamental problem arises: the system can enter a delusional loop when filtering the sensory information using an overly trusted <b>forward</b> <b>model.</b> In this case, learning stalls before accurate convergence because uncertainty about the <b>forward</b> <b>model</b> is not properly accommodated. We present a Bayes-optimal solution to this generic and pernicious problem for the case of linear <b>forward</b> <b>models,</b> which we call Predictive Inference and Adaptive Filtering (PIAF). PIAF filters incoming sensory information and learns the <b>forward</b> <b>model</b> simultaneously. We show that PIAF is formally related to Kalman filtering and to the Recursive Least Squares linear approximation method, but combines these procedures in a Bayes optimal fashion. Numerical evaluations confirm that the delusional loop is precluded and that the learning of the <b>forward</b> <b>model</b> is more than ten-times faster when compared to a naive combination of Kalman filtering and Recursive Least Squares...|$|R
