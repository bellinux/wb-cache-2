5|$|Some {{controversy}} {{exist between}} different Bible translations concerning the actual {{fate of the}} 5th century BC Persian minister Haman and his ten sons, whether they were impaled or hanged For example, the English Standard Version, Esther 5:14 opts <b>for</b> <b>hanging,</b> whereas The New International Reader's version opts for impalement.|$|E
5|$|X. bracteatum can {{be grown}} in large pots or window boxes, and is a good pioneer plant in the garden until other plants become more established. Lower-growing cultivars are {{suitable}} <b>for</b> <b>hanging</b> baskets and border plantings. The flowers attract butterflies to the garden. Dried flowers are long lasting—up to some years—and are used in floral arrangements and the cut flower industry. More robust longer stemmed forms are used for commercial cut flowers. The main factor limiting lifespan of dried flowers is the wilting of stems, so flowers are sometimes wired into arrangements. Immersing flowers in glycerol or polyethylene glycol also lengthens lifespan.|$|E
5|$|Hanging scroll: Hanging scrolls {{originated}} in their earliest form from literature and other texts written on bamboo strips and silk banners in ancient China. The earliest hanging scrolls {{are related to}} and developed from silk banners in early Chinese history. These banners were long and hung vertically on walls. Such silk banners and hanging scroll paintings were found at Mawangdui {{dating back to the}} Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). By the time of the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the aesthetic and structural objectives <b>for</b> <b>hanging</b> scrolls were summarized, which are still followed to this day. During the early Song Dynasty (960–1279), the scrolls became well suited to the art styles of the artists, consequently hanging scrolls were made in many different sizes and proportions.|$|E

25|$|As with {{suspension}} hanging, {{the condemned}} prisoner slowly dies of strangulation, which typically takes between ten and twenty minutes, {{resulting in a}} considerably more prolonged and painful death {{as compared to the}} standard or long drop hanging, which is intended to kill by using the shock of the drop to fracture the spinal column at the neck. Before 1850, the short drop was the standard method <b>for</b> <b>hanging,</b> and is still common in suicides and extrajudicial hangings (such as lynchings and summary executions) which do not benefit from the specialised equipment and drop-length calculation tables used by the newer methods.|$|E

25|$|Lesser short-nosed fruit bats {{prefer to}} roost {{in small groups}} in trees, under leaves, and in caves. Young males may roost alone. It is common for one male to roost with up to four females. Females may gather in groups of up to 20. To feed, the bats bite off the center part of palm fruit clusters, leaving a hollow <b>for</b> <b>hanging,</b> {{which is also the}} method they use to {{construct}} a shelter. Males may spend more than two months chewing the veins of leaves and palm fronds until they fall to form a shelter. Individuals use tactile, visual, and acoustic stimuli to communicate. They forage with their acute sense of smell and navigate with their keen vision.|$|E
25|$|B’laan tribe is {{probably}} the most popular Mindanao occupants of Mountain provinces <b>for</b> <b>Hanging</b> Coffins of Sagada. Even before the influence of Christianity, the elders feared being buried on the ground, since they wanted to reach heaven in their afterlife. Out of love and concern, the family would hang the coffins {{on the wall of the}} cave (such as Lumiang cave). However, this kind of burial procedure was similar to other fishing communities like Banton of Romblon. Another unique characteristic of this pre-colonial burial custom contains the tradition of inserting jars in the coffin. This was similar to the Manunggul jar discovered in Tabon cave, Palawan, making the custom pre-existing even before the pre-colonial era. For B’laan people, tree served as a zone of final rest, which is a unique pattern for most of the Mindanao tribes’ burial custom as well.|$|E
25|$|The NCIS {{report said}} that the detainees had rags in their throats. Both the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) had {{previously}} stated that only one detainee had a rag in his throat. The NCIS described the detainees bonds as loose and easily tied by the prisoners, and {{said that the}}y did not have to climb to the sinks <b>for</b> <b>hanging.</b> Because of the gravity of the events, the NCIS said the guards were expected to wait for NCIS investigators to give their statements (this is standard operating procedure (SOP) when criminal actions are possible). The NCIS report notes that numerous guards, detainees and medical personnel attested to seeing the deceased being transferred from the cellblock to the infirmary. Video records of the cellblock (which did not show the interiors of the cells) did not reveal anything amiss.|$|E

25|$|Southwick, local {{physician}} George E. Fell, and {{the head}} of the Buffalo ASPCA performed a series of experiments electrocuting hundreds of stray dogs, experimenting with animals in water, out of water, electrode types and placement, and conductive material until they came up with a repeatable method to euthanize animals using electricity. Southwick went on in the early 1880s to advocate that this method be used as a more humane replacement <b>for</b> <b>hanging</b> in capital cases, coming to national attention when he published his ideas in scientific journals in 1882 and 1883. He worked out calculations based on the dog experiments, trying to develop a scaled-up method that would work on humans. Early on in his designs he adopted a modified version of the dental chair as a way to restrain the condemned, a device that from then on would be referred called the electric chair.|$|E
25|$|The Boxer is a medium-sized, {{short-haired}} {{breed of}} dog, developed in Germany. The coat {{is smooth and}} tight-fitting; colours are fawn or brindled, with or without white markings, and white. Boxers are brachycephalic (they have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, mandibular prognathism (an underbite), very strong jaws, and a powerful bite ideal <b>for</b> <b>hanging</b> on to large prey. The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed. The purpose of the crossbreeding was the wish to eliminate the excessive white color of the breed, {{and the necessity of}} producing thousands of dogs {{for one of the most}} popular breeds in the world. The Boxer is part of the Molosser group. This group is a category of solidly built, large dog breeds that all descend from the same common ancestor, the large shepherd dog known as a Molossus. The Boxer is a member of the Working Group.|$|E
