25|$|The PS2 {{followed}} the PD2 Titan in having the 125bhp 9.8-litre O600 engine {{and a new}} synchromesh gearbox. With changes to rules on width and length there were numerous {{different versions of the}} home market PS2 based on permutations of width and length, whether built with or without a rear <b>dropped</b> <b>frame</b> and whether reconstructed from short-wheelbase chassis or built new to the longer wheelbase. PS2/1, 3, 5 and 7 had a 17ft 6in wheelbase for 27ft 6in bodywork. PS2/10, 11, 12, 12A, 13, 13A, 14 and 15 had a longer wheelbase of 18ft 9in for 30ft long coachwork (but see later about the six-wheel PS2/10 and /11). The entire home market Tiger range was vacuum-braked and PS2s for the UK had the synchromesh gearbox only, whilst the Titan PD2 had a number of options including constant-mesh, AEC preselector and Pneumocyclic. The last new PS2 coaches entered service in 1953 with West Riding Automobile Company, and the last home-market customer for the Tiger PS2 bus was the Burnley, Colne and Nelson Joint Transport Committee, their last arrived in 1955 and put in 20 years and more of work, thus being the last half-cab single deckers on normal service in the UK.|$|E

50|$|There {{was only}} one mass-produced {{derivative}} of the PS1, this was the coach variant with drop-frame extension for a luggage boot. This was coded PS1/1, and {{was a very strong}} seller, forming the major postwar fleet renewals for large UK coach firms such as Southdown Motor Services, Ribble, Wallace Arnold, Grey-Green and Barton Transport. Sales of the PS1 only ended in 1950 although it was nominally replaced by the PS2 on the home market from 1948, this gives an idea of the scale of advance orders for this coach. Many coachbuilers worldwide produced bodies on the Tiger PS, as the model was introduced at the all-time peak in demand for new buses and coaches few operators could get the body of their first choice within an acceptable time. Barton got most of its coaches fitted with Duple bodies but built its own body for its 490 (HVO729), to an American outline with shallow full-depth sliding side glazing. Wallace Arnold bought over a Leeds coachbuilder, Wilks and Meade, in 1942 to get enough bodies reserved for postwar reconstruction. Between 1946 and 1950 Wallace Arnold took 37 PS1, 11 PS2, 34 Bedford OB, 24 AEC Regals, ten Daimler CVD6 and one Guy Arab, a fairly typical sample of coach-buying preferences at the time. Southdown used six coachbuiilders on its all-Tiger coach fleet. Whilst Ribble refitted its later prewar Tiger coaches (which had previously been petrol-engined) with PS1 running units as well as taking PS1/1s.

30|$|A {{possible}} {{alternative solution}} is to stream low-quality video but then implement a super-resolution algorithm {{on the receiving end}} to upscale the streaming video. Super-resolution is an imaging technique that uses multiple low-resolution frames to construct a high-resolution frame.

Thus, packet losses or a <b>dropped</b> <b>frame</b> will not have as much of an impact on image quality compared to some video compression techniques.|$|E
40|$|International audienceHTTP video {{streaming}} becomes a main contributor in the ever increasing Internet traffic. It {{is not an}} easy task for the network service provider to guarantee the best user's Quality of Experience (QoE) in diverse networks with different access technologies. This requires an adaptive method that dynamically adapts the video quality service over HTTP according to time varying network conditions. In this paper, a client-based rate adaptive method is proposed that dynamically selects the appropriate video quality according to network conditions and user's device properties. The proposed method considers three important Quality of Service (QoS) factors that regulate the user's QoE for {{video streaming}} over HTTP, which are: Bandwidth, Buffer, and <b>dropped</b> <b>Frame</b> rate (BBF). The network bandwidth significantly affects the video service, as it directly reduces the client buffering that may result in pausing or stalling during video streaming. The proposed BBF method efficiently deals with sudden drop of network bandwidth by using the new bandwidth metric, and reduces its impact on the buffer level of the end user. The buffer length plays a vital role to handle the dynamic change in bandwidth. The <b>dropped</b> <b>frame</b> rate (fps) is another influential factor that minimizes the user's QoE. The proposed BBF algorithm is evaluated with different buffer length, and it is compared to Adobe's OSMF adaptive method...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the growth}} in network {{capacity}} of wireless in-home networks, these networks often have insufficient capacity to support multiple simultaneous Audio/Video streams.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a method for}} detection and removal of outlier images from digital Particle Image Velocimetry data using Proper Orthogonal De-composition (POD).

This is particularly useful, if a single PIV image is suddenly heavily contaminated with background noise, or to estimate a <b>dropped</b> <b>frame</b> within a sequence. The technique is tested on a synthetic dataset that permits the effective acquisition frequency to be varied systematically, before application to flow field frames obtained from a large-eddy simulation. As expected, outlier re-estimation becomes more difficult when the integral time scale for the flow is long relative to the sampling period. However, the method provides a systematic improvement in predicting frames compared to interpolating from neighbouring(1) frames...|$|E

Accurate buffer dimensioning has attracted lot of research interest as large on-chip buffers result in increased silicon area and higher costs. Multimedia applications present the flexibility of trading off quality for buffer space without any noticeable deterioration in video quality. The <b>frame</b> <b>dropping</b> scheme is crucial here to <b>drop</b> <b>frames</b> appropriately such that the required buffer size is reduced and target quality requirement is satisfied. Towards this, we propose a simple pri-oritized <b>frame</b> <b>dropping</b> mechanism which reduces the required buffer space more than existing <b>frame</b> <b>dropping</b> policies. We also provide a fast iterative procedure to find the minimum buffer size for a video clip with O(log(Ndrop)) number of iterations, where Ndrop is the maximum number of frames that can be dropped for a video clip so that a prespecified quality in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) value is satisfied...|$|R

(Because editors making cuts must be aware of the difference in color subcarrier phase between even and odd frames, it is helpful to skip pairs of frame numbers.) This achieves an [...] "easy-to-track" [...] <b>drop</b> <b>frame</b> rate of 18 frames each ten minutes (18,000 frames @ 30 frame/s) and almost perfectly compensates for the difference in rate, leaving a residual timing error of only 1.0 ppm, roughly 2.6 frames (86.4 milliseconds) per day.|$|R
