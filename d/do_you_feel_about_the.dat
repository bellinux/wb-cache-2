One question asked by the interviewer was: [...] "How {{do you deal with}} the Jews who are besieging al-Aqsa and are scattered around it?" [...] which was translated as: [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Jews?" [...] MEMRI cut out {{the first part of the}} reply and combined it with the answer to the next question, which, Whitaker claimed, made [...] "Arabs look more anti-semitic than they are". Carmon admitted this was an error in translation but defended combining the two replies as both questions referred to the same subject. [...] Carmon rejected other claims of distortion by Whitaker, saying: [...] "it is perhaps reassuring that you had to go back so far to find a mistake... You accused us of distortion by omission but when asked to provide examples of trends and views we have missed, you have failed to answer." [...] Carmon also accused Whitaker of [...] "using insults rather than evidence" [...] in his criticism of MEMRI.|$|E

I'm quite surprised by these conversations to be honest, {{simply because it}} seems quite a strange thing to be discussing {{out in the open}} like that.

Later next month, she clarified more about her stance on the issue that [...] "Jennifer Lawrence is amazing for speaking up and I think that anyone in this industry, particularly women, if there’s something strongly that they feel isn’t working for them or if they’re being discriminated against in any way, shape or form, it’s very, very important to speak up and so I fully applaud that. What I have a problem with is that there’s a separate thing that has started happening is that the lid has been somewhat lifted for journalists, and so journalists on red carpets will now say, ‘So how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> gender pay gap?’. ‘What? What’s the specific question?’. ‘Well, do you know that you got paid less or more than Michael Fassbender?’. That question? That to me is not very nice. I’m not going to have that conversation with a friend or even a family member, let alone in public. And so what’s happened {{as a result of these}} big very important discussions is that we’re then subjected to a particular line of questioning that being a Brit strikes me as being a little bit vulgar. Why would I stand on a red carpet and talk about how much I get paid?".|$|E

[...] However, Atkins grew nervous that fans would think the towel was a jinx if the Steelers lost the game. Cope agreed to poll players on their view of the towel. Linebacker Jack Ham told Cope, [...] "I think your idea stinks"; Ernie [...] "Fats" [...] Holmes was also against the idea. Also against the idea of the Towel was Andy Russell, who mirrored Cope's original thoughts, [...] "We're not a gimmick team. We've never been a gimmick team." [...] Cope simply replied, [...] "Russell, you're sick." [...] Growing nervous about the negative feedback, Cope, who had already advertised the towel on the news multiple times, polled the rest of the players with a [...] "banana-republic vote". I found Terry Bradshawseated on a stool at his locker, reading the farm reports. [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Terrible Towel?" [...] I asked him.He looked up and said, [...] "Huh?"I check him off as a yes...I reported back to Ted Atkins that the Steelers overwhelmingly approved of the Towel. Myron Cope, Double Yoi! The Towel made its debut on December 27, 1975, in a playoff game against the Baltimore Colts. Prior to the game, Cope, whose idea had been mocked by the local Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, watched the gathering fans through his binoculars from the broadcast booth. He saw less than a dozen towels while players were going through pre-game warm-ups. Cope recalls, [...] "Nearing kickoff, the Steelers gathered in their tunnel for introductions, whereupon the crowd exploded - and suddenly, by my estimation, 30,000 Terrible Towels twirled from the fists of fans around the stadium!" [...] The Steelers went on to defeat the Colts 28 - 10. In the following weeks, the team defeated the Oakland Raiders and Dallas Cowboys, to capture the franchise's second consecutive Super Bowl victory. Even while the Steelers struggled through the 1980s, the Towel remained a large part of the franchise. During the Towel's debut game Andy Russell, who had opposed the idea of the Towel, returned a fumble 93‒yards for a touchdown. The play inspired local fan Lisa Benz to write about the Towel, which she later sent to Cope. In part, her poem read: ...|$|E

A comprehensive analysis of the interviews revealed some categories: including feelings about breast cancer, the stigma of the disease and mutilation, disease and treatment, the femininity and sexuality as well as acceptance of the disease.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Advancements in {{information}} and computer technology have radically transformed {{the education and}} training. The use of technology in education is increasing rapidly. Technology-assisted education have changed the distance education or e-learning methods {{in such a way}} that beyond the limits of imagination, ten years ago. However, usefulness of these technologies should be questioned. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the effectiveness of distance education (especially e-learning) programs in Turkish Army according to the reactions of the coursiers and to determine the answer of the question: Is the distance education system implemented successfully in the army? As the method, we used the reaction level of the Kirkpatrick’s evaluation model that is the most commonly known method to evaluate training. The first question that we should ask trainees is “How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> distance education?” We measure iv the trainees' feelings and satisfaction with the distance education program by conducting a questionnaire to the coursiers of two courses, which were partially offered via distance education. After making the quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis of data we conclude that the implementation of distance education programs have some problems. To overcome these problems we put forth some suggestions about motivation of trainees, study time, content, etc. Turgut, CemalM. S...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Analogous to the {{business}} model of customer satisfaction and retention, patient satisfaction could serve as an innovative, patient-centered focus for increasing retention in HIV care and adherence to HAART, and ultimately HIV suppression. OBJECTIVE: To test, through structural equation modeling (SEM), a model of HIV suppression in which patient satisfaction influences HIV suppression indirectly through retention in HIV care and adherence to HAART. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of adults receiving HIV care at two clinics in Texas. Patient satisfaction was based on two validated items, one adapted from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey ("Would you recommend this clinic to other patients with HIV?) and one adapted from the Delighted-Terrible Scale, ("Overall, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> care you got at this clinic in the last 12 months?"). A validated, single-item question measured adherence to HAART over the past 4 weeks. Retention in HIV care was based on visit constancy in the year prior to the survey. HIV suppression was defined as plasma HIV RNA < 48 copies/mL {{at the time of}} the survey. We used SEM to test hypothesized relationships. RESULTS: The analyses included 489 patients (94 % of eligible patients). The patient satisfaction score had a mean of 8. 5 (median 9. 2) on a 0 - to 10 - point scale. A total of 46 % reported "excellent" adherence, 76 % had adequate retention, and 70 % had HIV suppression. In SEM analyses, patient satisfaction with care influences retention in HIV care and adherence to HAART, which in turn serve as key determinants of HIV suppression (all p<. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: Patient satisfaction may have direct effects on retention in HIV care and adherence to HAART. Interventions to improve the care experience, without necessarily targeting objective clinical performance measures, could serve as an innovative method for optimizing HIV outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore some of the {{practices}} of home economics teachers in the use of auxiliary personnel as expressed by city and state supervisors. A second purpose was to discover the beliefs of city and state supervisors regarding the use of auxiliary personnel in home economics programs. A questionnaire was designed and validated to determine these practices and beliefs. Two hundred fifty-nine questionnaires were sent to city and state supervisors. A total of 130 usable questionnaires were returned. The questions proposed for study were: 1. Do you have any auxiliary personnel in the city or state home economics program which you represent? 2. Who are the auxiliary workers being used in home economics classes in your program? 3. How did your program get started? 4. What are the aides doing? 5. What difference do aides make in the total home economics program? 6. What training do the aides have? 7. How are teachers prepared or trained to use aides ? 8. Do you have in your city or state job descriptions for auxiliary workers ? 9. Do you have in your city or state criteria for the hiring of aides ? 10. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> concept of teacher aides ? It was assumed that when the results of these questions were tabulated, guidelines for the use of auxiliary personnel in home economics education programs could be developed. Findings Over half (59 percent) of the total number of respondents reported that they did not have auxiliary workers in their programs. Of those programs that did have auxiliary workers over 50 percent indicated that the workers were mostly community residents. Respondents with auxiliary programs indicated that the auxiliary personnel were generally paid and working part time. A little over one third of the programs were started as a result of teacher requests and federal funding. Five categories of activities for auxiliary duties were listed. They were: actual work with students; audio-visual aids; housekeeping; interpreting the program; and secretarial. The respondents were asked to designate how frequently each activity was carried out by the auxiliaries. Most of the programs had auxiliaries who frequently worked with students. Fifty-one percent of the programs had auxiliary workers trained in after school meetings. It could not be determined from the data how the training was conducted or to what extent. About one third of the programs had teachers trained through supervisor-teacher conferences. Again, it could not be determined how the training was conducted or to what extent. Important to note, however, is that nearly one third of the programs had teachers who had no training or preparation for working with aides. The supervisors were asked to indicate how they felt toward particular statements about teacher aide programs. They were given the following choices to indicate their degree of agreement: agreed; had no feeling one way or another; disagreed; undecided or wanted to qualify the statement. Over ninety percent of the respondents agreed that aides should understand how to work with children, that aides should have planning time together with their teachers, and that aides' assignments should grow out of the needs of a given teaching situation. There were three concepts where 50 percent or more of the supervisors disagreed. Those concepts were: it is not necessary for teachers to have training in working with aides; teaching responsibilities require many different levels of skills, all of these must be carried out by the same individual; aides can be a threat with regard to salary increases for the teacher. Supervisors were asked for statements as to what difference aides make in the total home economics program. Most of the responses were brief and in agreement with the literature. In general, they felt that teachers could concentrate more effectively on professional functions when aided. Respondents were also asked if they had job descriptions and criteria for the hiring of aides in their city or state. Although a few supervisors said that they were currently working on developing these items, most of them did not have such descriptions or criteria in their programs. Guidelines After the data were collected and analyzed guidelines for the use of auxiliary personnel in home economics education programs were developed. They were developed in two parts; guidelines for administrators and guidelines for home economics teachers. These guidelines encompass concepts pertaining to aspects of auxiliary personnel programs such as: scope, type of worker, aide training, aide placement, aide qualifications and standards, aide duties, teacher, and teacher training...|$|E
