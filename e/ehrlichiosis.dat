5|$|Ticks are {{implicated in}} the {{transmission}} {{of a number of}} infections caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses and protozoa. Sometimes the tick harbours more than one type of pathogen, making diagnosis of the infection more difficult. Species of the bacterium Rickettsia are responsible for typhus, rickettsialpox, Boutonneuse fever, African tick bite fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Flinders Island spotted fever and Queensland tick typhus (Australian tick typhus). Other tick-borne diseases include Lyme disease and Q fever, Colorado tick fever, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, tularemia, tick-borne relapsing fever, babesiosis, <b>ehrlichiosis,</b> Bourbon virus and tick-borne meningoencephalitis, as well as bovine anaplasmosis and probably the Heartland virus.|$|E
25|$|Although {{people can}} get <b>ehrlichiosis,</b> dogs do not {{transmit}} the bacteria to humans; rather, ticks pass on the ehrlichia organism. Clinical signs of human <b>ehrlichiosis</b> include fever, headache, eye pain, and gastrointestinal upset. It is quite similar to Rocky Mountain spotted fever, but rash is not seen in patients.|$|E
25|$|Ehrlichia is a rickettsial {{bacteria}} {{belonging to}} the family Ehrlichiaceae. There are several species of Ehrlichia, but the one that most commonly affects dogs and causes the most severe clinical signs is Ehrlichia canis. This species infects monocytes in the peripheral blood. The brown dog tick, or Rhipicephalus sanguineous, that passes the organism to the dog is prevalent {{throughout most of the}} United States, but most cases tend to occur in the Southwest and Gulf Coast regions where there is a high concentration of the tick. Ehrlichia is found {{in many parts of the}} world and was first recognized in Algeria in 1935. During the Vietnam War <b>ehrlichiosis</b> became well known as a dog disease due to the infection and death of many military working dogs. Two types of human <b>ehrlichiosis</b> have been identified in the United States: human monocytic <b>ehrlichiosis</b> and human granulocytic <b>ehrlichiosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Ehrlichiosis</b> is {{a disease}} caused by Ehrlichia canis and spread by the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Signs include fever, vasculitis, and low blood counts.|$|E
25|$|Dogs get <b>ehrlichiosis</b> {{from the}} brown dog tick, which passes an ehrlichia {{organism}} {{into the bloodstream}} when it bites. It is also possible for dogs to become infected through a blood transfusion from an infected dog. There are three stages of <b>ehrlichiosis,</b> each varying in severity. The acute stage, occurring several weeks after infection and lasting {{for up to a}} month, can lead to fever and lowered peripheral blood cell counts due to bone marrow suppression. The second stage, called the subclinical phase, has no outward signs and can last {{for the remainder of the}} dog's life, during which the dog remains infected with the organism. Some dogs are able to successfully eliminate the disease during this time. In some dogs the third and most serious stage of infection, the chronic phase, will commence. Very low blood cell counts (pancytopenia), bleeding, bacterial infection, lameness, neurological and ophthalmic disorders, and kidney disease, can result. Chronic <b>ehrlichiosis</b> can be fatal.|$|E
25|$|Ticks* are an {{external}} parasite {{of the dog}} and can spread diseases such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, babesiosis, and <b>ehrlichiosis.</b> They can also cause a neurological disorder known as tick paralysis.|$|E
25|$|It {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} and prophylaxis of anthrax and Leptospirosis. It is also effective against Yersinia pestis (the infectious agent of bubonic plague), and is prescribed for {{the treatment}} of Lyme disease, <b>ehrlichiosis</b> and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.|$|E
25|$|Uveitis* is {{inflammation}} {{within the}} eye. Anterior uveitis (inflammation of the iris and ciliary body) is {{most common in}} dogs. The disease is usually immune-mediated in dogs, but may also be caused by trauma, cataracts, infectious canine hepatitis, leptospirosis, <b>ehrlichiosis,</b> or systemic fungal infections.|$|E
25|$|The {{prognosis}} {{is good for}} dogs with acute <b>ehrlichiosis.</b> For dogs that have reached the chronic stage of the disease, the {{prognosis is}} guarded. When bone marrow suppression occurs and there are low levels of blood cells, the animal may not respond to treatment.|$|E
25|$|For early cases, prompt {{treatment}} is usually curative. However, the severity {{and treatment of}} Lyme disease may be complicated due to late diagnosis, failure of antibiotic treatment, and simultaneous infection with other tick-borne diseases (coinfections), including <b>ehrlichiosis,</b> babesiosis, and immune suppression in the patient.|$|E
25|$|Thrombocytopenia* is {{a common}} {{condition}} in dogs characterized by low platelet counts. Platelets are used in clotting the blood, so dogs with this condition may have spontaneous bleeding or prolonged bleeding following surgery, injury, or during an estrous cycle. Causes include some rickettsial infections such as <b>ehrlichiosis,</b> cancers such as hemangiosarcoma, or immune-mediated disease.|$|E
25|$|Some {{parasitic}} forms affect {{humans and}} other mammals, causing damage by their feeding, {{and can even}} be vectors of diseases, such as scrub typhus, rickettsialpox, Lyme disease, Q fever, Colorado tick fever, tularemia, tick-borne relapsing fever, babesiosis, <b>ehrlichiosis</b> and tick-borne meningoencephalitis. A well known effect of mites on humans is their role as an allergen and the stimulation of asthma in people affected by respiratory disease.|$|E
25|$|Supportive {{care must}} be {{provided}} to animals that have clinical signs. Subcutaneous or intravenous fluids are given to dehydrated animals, and severely anemic dogs may require a blood transfusion. Treatment for <b>ehrlichiosis</b> {{involves the use of}} antibiotics such as tetracycline or doxycycline for a period of at least six to eight weeks; response to the drugs may take one month. Treatment with macrolide antibiotics like clarithromycin and azithromycin is being studied. In addition, steroids may be indicated in severe cases in which the level of platelets is so low that the condition is life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|Hemolytic anemia* {{is a type}} of {{regenerative}} anemia {{found in}} dogs characterized by destruction of the red blood cell. The most important type is immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, which can be a primary disease or secondary to cancer, infection, drugs, or vaccinations. Antibodies are present on the cell surface, leading to lysis and severe anemia. Other causes of hemolytic lesion include hypophosphatemia, exposure to toxins such as lead, infections such as <b>ehrlichiosis</b> or babesiosis, and rarely, neonatal isoerythrolysis. The behavioral condition pica, especially when involving the eating of concrete dust, tile grout, or sand, may be a sign of hemolytic anemia, indicating the need for a complete blood count to investigate a possible diagnosis.|$|E
