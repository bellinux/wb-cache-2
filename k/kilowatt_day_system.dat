5000|$|... 1370 KFRO is a class B station. KFRO is 1 <b>kilowatt</b> <b>day</b> {{non-directional}} (1 tower), 1 kilowatt night directional (3 towers). The KFRO towers are 177 feet tall. The current KFRO transmitter {{building was}} built in 2003. KFRO signed on in 1935 with a 100 watt homemade transmitter. In 1935 KFRO increased its power to 250 watts with a Western Electric transmitter. In 1941 power was increased to 1,000 watts and a new RCA BTA-1D was installed, it stayed in service until 1983, when it {{was replaced by a}} Rockwell Collins 820-D2. The Rockwell Collins transmitter was made to run C-QUAM AM Stereo, which made KFRO the first AM stereo station in East Texas. The Collins-Rockwell was replaced in 2003 with a used 1978 Harris MW-1 solid state transmitter which is still in service.|$|R

Solar panels were also considered for the MSL, but RTGs provide constant power, regardless of the time of day, and thus the versatility to work in dark environments and high latitudes where solar energy is not readily available.

40|$|Abstract—Frequent machine breakdowns, low plant {{availability}} and increased overtime {{are a great}} threat to a manufacturing plant as they increase operating costs of an industry. The main {{aim of this study}} was to improve Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) at a manufacturing company through the implementation of innovative maintenance strategies. A case study approach was used. The paper focuses on improving the maintenance in a manufacturing set up using an innovative maintenance regime mix to improve overall equipment effectiveness. Interviews, reviewing documentation and historical records, direct and participatory observation were used as data collection methods during the research. Usually production is based on the total kilowatt of motors produced per <b>day.</b> The target <b>kilowatt</b> at 91 % availability is 75 <b>Kilowatts</b> a <b>day.</b> Reduced demand and lack of raw materials particularly imported items are adversely affecting the manufacturing operations. The company had to reset its targets from the usual figure of 250 <b>Kilowatt</b> per <b>day</b> to mere 75 per day due to lower availability of machines as result of breakdowns as well as lack of raw materials. The price reductions and uncertainties as well as general machine breakdowns further lowered production. Some recommendations were given. For instance, employee empowerment in the company will enhance responsibility and authority to improve and totally eliminate the six big losses. If the maintenance department is to realise its proper function in a progressive, innovative industrial society, then its personnel must be continuously trained to meet current needs as well as future requirements. To make the maintenance planning system effective, it is essential to keep track of all the corrective maintenance jobs and preventive maintenance inspections. For large processing plants these cannot be handled manually. It was therefore recommended that the company implement (Computerised Maintenance Management System) CMMS...|$|R
