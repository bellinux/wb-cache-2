25|$|Virtual globes (along {{with all}} <b>hypermedia</b> and virtual reality software) are distant {{descendants}} of the Aspen Movie Map project, which pioneered the concept of using computers to simulate distant physical environments (though the Movie Map's scope {{was limited to the}} city of Aspen, Colorado).|$|E
25|$|New Media as the Encoding of Modernist Avant-Garde; New Media as Metamedia Manovich {{declares}} that the 1920s are {{more relevant to}} New Media than any other time period. Metamedia coincides with postmodernism in that they both rework old work rather than create new work. New media avant-garde is about new ways of accessing and manipulating information (e.g. <b>hypermedia,</b> databases, search engines, etc.). Meta-media {{is an example of}} how quantity can change into quality as in new media technology and manipulation techniques can recode modernist aesthetics into a very different postmodern aesthetics.|$|E
25|$|Web 2.0 often uses machine-based {{interactions}} such as REST and SOAP. Servers often expose proprietary Application programming interfaces (API), but standard APIs (for example, for posting to a blog or notifying a blog update) {{have also}} come into use. Most communications through APIs involve XML or JSON payloads. REST APIs, through {{their use of}} self-descriptive messages and <b>hypermedia</b> as the engine of application state, should be self-describing once an entry URI is known. Web Services Description Language (WSDL) is the standard way of publishing a SOAP Application programming interface {{and there are a}} range of Web service specifications.|$|E
25|$|It {{was this}} {{combination}} of features that also made HyperCard a powerful <b>hypermedia</b> system. Users could build backgrounds to suit the needs of some system, say a rolodex, and use simple HyperTalk commands to provide buttons to move {{from place to place}} within the stack, or provide the same navigation system within the data elements of the UI, like text fields. Using these features, it is easy to build linked systems similar to hypertext links on the Web. Unlike the Web, programming, placement and browsing were all the same tool – similar systems have been created for HTML but traditional Web services are considerably more heavyweight.|$|E
25|$|Writing at Brown—fiction, non-fiction, poetry, playwriting, screenwriting, {{electronic}} writing, mixed media, and {{the undergraduate}} writing proficiency requirement—is catered for by various centers and degree programs, and a faculty {{that has long}} included nationally and internationally known authors. The undergraduate concentration (major) in literary arts offers courses in fiction, poetry, screenwriting, literary <b>hypermedia,</b> and translation. Graduate programs include the fiction and poetry MFA writing programs in the literary arts department, and the MFA playwriting program in the theatre arts and performance studies department. The non-fiction writing program is offered in the English department. Screenwriting and cinema narrativity courses are offered in the departments of literary arts and modern culture and media.

2500|$|Jakob Nielsen {{has pointed}} out that HyperCard was really only a <b>hypermedia</b> program since its links started from regions on a card, not text objects; actual HTML-style text hyperlinks were {{possible}} in later versions, but were awkward to implement and seldom used. Deena Larsen programmed links into HyperCard for Marble Springs. [...] Bill Atkinson later lamented that if he had only realized the power of network-oriented stacks, instead of focusing on local stacks on a single machine, HyperCard could have become the first Web browser.|$|E
50|$|An {{adaptive}} <b>hypermedia</b> {{system should}} satisfy three criteria: {{it should be}} a hypertext or <b>hypermedia</b> system, it should have a user model and {{it should be a}}ble to adapt the <b>hypermedia</b> using the model.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>hypermedia</b> work was, arguably, the Aspen Movie Map. Bill Atkinson's HyperCard popularized <b>hypermedia</b> writing, while {{a variety}} of {{literary}} hypertext and hypertext works, fiction and non-fiction, demonstrated the promise of links. Most modern <b>hypermedia</b> is delivered via electronic pages from {{a variety of}} systems including media players, web browsers, and stand-alone applications (i. e., software that does not require network access). Audio <b>hypermedia</b> is emerging with voice command devices and voice browsing.|$|E
50|$|After 1996, {{adaptive}} <b>hypermedia</b> grew rapidly. Research teams commenced {{projects in}} adaptive <b>hypermedia,</b> and many students selected the subject area for their PhD theses. A book on adaptive <b>hypermedia,</b> {{and a special}} issue of the New Review of <b>Hypermedia</b> and Multimedia (1998) were published. Two main factors accounted for this growth. Due a diverse audience, the internet boosted research into adaptivity. Almost all the papers published before 1996 describe classic pre-Web hypertext and hypermedia; {{the majority of papers}} published since 1996 are devoted to Web-based adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> systems. The second factor was is the accumulation and consolidation of research experience in the field. Early papers provided few references to similar work in adaptive <b>hypermedia,</b> and described original laboratory systems developed to demonstrate and explore innovative ideas. After 1996, papers cite earlier work, and usually suggest either real world systems, or research systems developed for real world settings by elaborating or an extending techniques suggested earlier. This is indicative of the relative maturity of adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> as a research direction.|$|E
50|$|Adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> (AH) uses <b>hypermedia</b> {{which is}} {{adaptive}} {{according to a}} user model. In contrast to linear media, where all users are offered a standard series of hyperlinks, adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> (AH) tailors what the user is offered based on {{a model of the}} user's goals, preferences and knowledge, thus providing links or content most appropriate to the current user.|$|E
50|$|H2PTM, or Hypertext <b>Hypermedia</b> Products Tools and Methods, is an {{international}} conference on <b>hypermedia.</b> The first congress was held in Paris, in 1989, organized by the Paragraphe Lab, University of Paris VIII.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypermedia</b> {{applications}} may {{be developed}} on embedded devices for the mobile and the digital signage industries using the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) specification from W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). Software applications, such as Ikivo Animator and Inkscape, simplify {{the development of}} <b>hypermedia</b> content based on SVG. Embedded devices, such as the iPhone, natively support SVG specifications and {{may be used to}} create mobile and distributed <b>hypermedia</b> applications.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypermedia</b> {{is used as}} {{a medium}} and {{constraint}} in certain application programming interfaces. HATEOAS, <b>Hypermedia</b> as the Engine of Application State, is a constraint of the REST application architecture where a client interacts with the server entirely through <b>hypermedia</b> provided dynamically by application servers. This means that in theory no API documentation is needed, because the client needs no prior knowledge about how to interact with any particular application or server beyond a generic understanding of <b>hypermedia.</b> In other service-oriented architectures (SOA), clients and servers interact through a fixed interface shared through documentation or an interface description language (IDL).|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, {{the two main}} parent areas - {{hypertext}} and user modeling - had achieved a level of maturity that allowed for the research in these areas to be explored together. Many researchers had recognized the problems of static hypertext in different application areas, and explored various ways to adapt the output and behavior of hypertext systems to suit the needs of individual users. Several early papers on adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> {{were published in the}} User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction (UMUAI) journal; the first workshop on adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> was held during a user modeling conference; and a special issue of UMUAI on adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> was published in 1996. Several innovative adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> techniques had been developed, and several research-level adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> systems had been built and evaluated.|$|E
5000|$|Adaptive {{educational}} hypermedia: Being {{a subdivision}} of adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> {{the main focus}} of adaptive educational <b>hypermedia</b> lies on education, displaying content and hyperlinks corresponding to the user's knowledge on the field of study.|$|E
50|$|There {{already exist}} some {{approaches}} to help authors to build adaptive-hypermedia-based systems. However, {{there is a}} strong need for high-level approaches, formalisms and tools that support and facilitate the description of reusable adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> and websites. Such models started appearing (see, e.g., the AHAM model of adaptive <b>hypermedia,</b> or the LAOS framework for authoring of adaptive <b>hypermedia).</b> Moreover, recently have we noticed a shift in interest, as it became clearer that the implementation-oriented approach would forever keep adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> away from the 'layman' author. The creator of adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> cannot be expected to know all facets of the process as described above. Still, he/she can be reasonably trusted to be an expert in one of these facets. For instance, it is reasonable to expect that there are content experts (such as, e.g., experts in chemistry, for instance). It is reasonable to expect, for adaptive educational <b>hypermedia</b> that there are experts in pedagogy, who are able to add pedagogical metadata to the content created by content experts. Finally, it is reasonable to expect that adaptation experts will be the one creating the implementation of adaptation strategies, and descriptions (metadata) of such nature that they can be understood and applied by laymen authors. This type of division of work determines the different authoring personas that should be expected to collaborate in the creation process of adaptive <b>hypermedia.</b> Moreover, the contributions of these various personas correspond to the different modules that are to be expected in adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> systems.|$|E
5000|$|Authoring of {{adaptive}} <b>hypermedia</b> was long considered as secondary to adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> delivery. This {{was not surprising}} {{in the early stages}} {{of adaptive}} <b>hypermedia,</b> when the focus was on research and expansion. Now that adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> itself has reached a certain maturity, the issue is to bring it out to the community and let the various stakeholders reap the benefits. However, authoring and creation of <b>hypermedia</b> is not trivial. Unlike in traditional authoring for <b>hypermedia</b> and the web, a linear storyline is not enough. Instead, various alternatives have to be created for the given material. For example, if a course should be delivered both to visual and verbal learners, there should be created at least two perfectly equivalent versions of the material in visual and in verbal form, respectively. Moreover, an adaptation strategy should be created that states that the visual content should be delivered to visual learners, whereas the verbal content should be delivered to the verbal learners. Thus, authors should not only be able to create different versions of their content, but be able to specify (and in some cases, design from scratch) adaptation strategies of delivery of contents. Issues with which authoring of adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> is confronted are: ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the field}} of digital and {{interactive}} television, Nested Context Language (NCL) is a declarative authoring language for <b>hypermedia</b> documents. NCL documents do not contain multimedia elements such as audio or video content; rather they function as a [...] "glue" [...] language that specifies how multimedia components are related. In particular, NCL documents specify how these components are synchronized relative {{to each other and}} how the components are composed together into a unified document. Among its main facilities, it treats <b>hypermedia</b> relations as first-class entities through the definition of <b>hypermedia</b> connectors, and it can specify arbitrary semantics for a <b>hypermedia</b> composition using the concept of composite templates.|$|E
5000|$|US patent 5,838,906, titled [...] "Distributed <b>hypermedia</b> {{method for}} {{automatically}} invoking external application providing interaction and display of embedded objects within a <b>hypermedia</b> document," [...] was filed on October 17, 1994 and granted on November 17, 1998.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{theories}} concerning <b>hypermedia</b> and learning. One important claim in the literature on <b>hypermedia</b> and learning is that it offers more control over the instructional environment for the reader or student. Another claim is that it levels the playing field among students of varying abilities and enhances collaborative learning.A claim from psychology includes the notion that <b>hypermedia</b> more closely models the structure of the brain, in comparison with printed text.|$|E
5000|$|With HATEOAS, {{a client}} interacts with a network {{application}} that application servers provide dynamically entirely through <b>hypermedia.</b> A REST client needs no prior knowledge {{about how to}} interact with an application or server beyond a generic understanding of <b>hypermedia.</b>|$|E
50|$|The first <b>hypermedia</b> {{application}} was the Aspen Movie Map in 1978. In 1980, Tim Berners-Lee created ENQUIRE, an early hypertext database system somewhat like a wiki. The early 1980s {{also saw a}} number of experimental hypertext and <b>hypermedia</b> programs, many of whose features and terminology were later integrated into the Web. Guide was the first significant hypertext system for personal computers. In 1983, a <b>hypermedia</b> authoring tool, Tutor-Tech, designed for Apple II computers, was produced for educators.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hypermedia</b> may be {{developed}} {{in a number of}} ways. Any programming tool can be used to write programs that link data from internal variables and nodes for external data files. Multimedia development software such as Adobe Flash, Adobe Director, Macromedia Authorware, and MatchWare Mediator may be used to create stand-alone <b>hypermedia</b> applications, with emphasis on entertainment content. Some database software, such as Visual FoxPro and FileMaker Developer, may be used to develop stand-alone <b>hypermedia</b> applications, with emphasis on educational and business content management.|$|E
