5|$|An acute <b>exacerbation</b> of COPD {{is defined}} as {{increased}} shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the chest is compressing the airways at this time. This can result in more air from the previous breath remaining within the lungs when the next breath is started, resulting {{in an increase in}} the total volume of air in the lungs at any given time, a process called hyperinflation or air trapping. Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less comfortable to breathe in when the lungs are already partly full. Hyperinflation may also worsen during an <b>exacerbation.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Exacerbations</b> {{of chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) are heterogeneous. In particular {{the association of}} airway inflammation with pathogens during <b>exacerbations</b> of COPD remains largely unknown. The identification of biomarkers of COPD aims to characterise and phenotype COPD and COPD <b>exacerbations,</b> explore mechanisms of pathogenesis and provide decisions regarding targeted treatment strategies. After validating the Meso scale discovery platform, biomarkers in stable state and during <b>exacerbations</b> COPD were explored. COPD <b>exacerbations</b> were associated with increased systemic and pulmonary inflammation and <b>exacerbations</b> associated with bacteria, virus and sputum eosinophils could be identified by sensitive and specific biomarkers. Multivariate statistical analysis identified independent biological <b>exacerbations</b> phenotypes and that these phenotypes could be predicted from stable state biomarkers. Finally a biomarker directed strategy using the peripheral blood eosinophil count to guide systemic corticosteroid therapy during <b>exacerbations</b> of COPD was effective, safe and identified phenotypes which have particular prognostic and therapeutic characteristics. To conclude, biomarkers can define the heterogeneity of COPD and COPD <b>exacerbations.</b> The identification of COPD phenotypes can potentially move the management towards phenotype specific management and personalised medicine.

5|$|Non-genetic, environmental, post-infectious, or psychosocial factors—while not causing Tourette's—can {{influence}} its severity. Autoimmune processes {{may affect}} tic onset and <b>exacerbation</b> in some cases. In 1998, a {{team at the}} US National Institute of Mental Health proposed a hypothesis based on observation of 50 children that both obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders may arise in a subset of children {{as a result of}} a poststreptococcal autoimmune process. Children who meet five diagnostic criteria are classified, according to the hypothesis, as having Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections (PANDAS). This contentious hypothesis is the focus of clinical and laboratory research, but remains unproven.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} arise when {{the concentration of}} metabolically active gases is increased. These range from the toxic effects of oxygen at high partial pressure, through buildup of carbon dioxide due to excessive work of breathing, increased dead space, or inefficient removal, to the <b>exacerbation</b> of the toxic effects of contaminants in the breathing gas due to the increased concentration at high pressures. Hydrostatic pressure differences between {{the interior of the}} lung and the breathing gas delivery, increased breathing gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased flow resistance due to higher breathing rates may all cause increased work of breathing and fatigue of the respiratory muscles.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis vulgaris (also {{known as}} chronic {{stationary}} psoriasis or plaque-like psoriasis) {{is the most}} common form and affects 85%–90% of people with psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis typically appears as raised areas of inflamed skin covered with silvery-white scaly skin. These areas are called plaques and are most commonly found on the elbows, knees, scalp, and back. Psoriatic erythroderma (erythrodermic psoriasis) involves widespread inflammation and exfoliation of the skin over most of the body surface. It may be accompanied by severe itching, swelling, and pain. It is often the result of an <b>exacerbation</b> of unstable plaque psoriasis, particularly following the abrupt withdrawal of systemic glucocorticoids. This form of psoriasis can be fatal as the extreme inflammation and exfoliation disrupt the body's ability to regulate temperature and perform barrier functions.|$|E

5|$|An acute <b>exacerbation</b> (a sudden {{worsening}} of symptoms) {{is commonly}} triggered by infection or environmental pollutants, or sometimes by other {{factors such as}} improper use of medications. Infections {{appear to be the}} cause of 50 to 75% of cases, with bacteria in 25%, viruses in 25%, and both in 25%. Environmental pollutants include both poor indoor and outdoor air quality. Exposure to personal smoke and secondhand smoke increases the risk. Cold temperature may also play a role, with exacerbations occurring more commonly in winter. Those with more severe underlying disease have more frequent exacerbations: in mild disease 1.8 per year, moderate 2 to 3 per year, and severe 3.4 per year. Those with many exacerbations have a faster rate of deterioration of their lung function. Pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the lungs) can worsen symptoms in those with pre-existing COPD. Signs of PE in COPD include pleuritic chest pain and heart failure without signs of infection.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{psoriasis}} in HIV-positive {{individuals is}} {{comparable to that of}} HIV-negative individuals, however, psoriasis tends to be more severe in people infected with HIV. A much higher rate of psoriatic arthritis occurs in HIV-positive individuals with psoriasis than in those without the infection. The immune response in those infected with HIV is typically characterized by cellular signals from Th2 subset of CD4+ helper T cells, whereas the immune response in psoriasis vulgaris is characterized by a pattern of cellular signals typical of Th1 subset of CD4+ helper T cells and Th17 helper T cells. It is hypothesized that the diminished CD4+-T cell presence causes an overactivation of CD8+-T cells, which are responsible for the <b>exacerbation</b> of psoriasis in HIV-positive people. Psoriasis in those with HIV/AIDS is often severe and may be untreatable with conventional therapy.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the nature and effect of <b>exacerbations</b> in patients with a 1 -antitrypsin deficiency and {{to assess the impact}} of <b>exacerbations</b> on health status. Furthermore, the relationship of <b>exacerbations</b> to changes in lung function and health status was investigated. In total, 265 patients with severe deficiency (PiZ phenotype) were assessed over 12 months and a subgroup of 87 patients was studied for 3 yrs. <b>Exacerbations</b> were recorded and patients underwent full lung function testing and health status measurement. <b>Exacerbations</b> occurred in 142 patients (54 %) over 12 months, with a median duration of 14 days (interquartile range 7 – 21). Health status was significantly worse in patients with <b>exacerbations,</b> especially those with frequent <b>exacerbations.</b> Neither the presence nor the frequency of <b>exacerbations</b> showed a relationship to decline in forced expiratory volume in one second, but the number of <b>exacerbations</b> was weakly associated with decline in gas transfer of the lung for carbon monoxide. Despite lung function decline, health status did not change significantly over 3 yrs. In conclusion, <b>exacerbations</b> occur commonly in patients with a 1 -antitrypsin deficiency and are associated with worse health status. <b>Exacerbations</b> were associated with a decline in the gas transfer of the lung for carbon monoxide over time, but show no relationship to changes in forced expiratory volume in one second.

Despite the clinical importance of exacerba-tions, it is not entirely clear why some COPD patients experience frequent <b>exacerbations,</b> while others remain relatively stable. Though <b>exacerbations</b> tend to become more frequent in those with poor lung function, it has recently been shown that the single best predictor of <b>exacerbations</b> is a history of previous <b>exacerbations</b> [4].

40|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of multiple sclerosis is the unpredictable occurrence of <b>exacerbations</b> and remissions. These fluctuations in disease activity are related to alterations in (auto-) immune activity. <b>Exacerbations</b> lead to short-term morbidity, but may also influence long-term disability. This longitudinal study in 73 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis assessed the contribution of systemic infections to the natural course of <b>exacerbations.</b> In addition, we analysed whether infections lead to {{an increase in the number}} of gadolinium-enhancing lesions. A total of 167 infections and 145 <b>exacerbations</b> were observed during 6466 patient weeks. During a predefined at-risk period (ARP) of 2 weeks before until 5 weeks after the onset of a clinical infection (predominantly upper airway infections), there was an increased risk of <b>exacerbations</b> (rate ratio 2. 1), which is in accordance with previous studies. <b>Exacerbations</b> with onset during the ARP led more frequently to sustained deficit [increase of > or = 1 Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) point or > or = 0. 5 above EDSS 5. 5 for > 3 months] than <b>exacerbations</b> with onset outside the ARP, with a rate ratio of 3. 8. Minor and major <b>exacerbations</b> were equally distributed between the ARP and non-ARP onset groups. ARP <b>exacerbations</b> were associated with significantly higher plasma levels of the inflammatory marker soluble intracellular adhesion molecule 1 than non-ARP <b>exacerbations,</b> indicating relatively enhanced immune activation during ARP relapses. Three serial MRI scans were performed after the onset of an infection over a 6 -week period. There was no difference in the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions between the three time points.
