5000|$|Selective inabilities to {{recognize}} faces were documented {{as early as}} the 19th century, and included case studies by Hughlings Jackson and Charcot. However, it was not named until the term prosopagnosia was first used in 1947 by Joachim Bodamer, a German neurologist. He described three cases, including a 24-year-old man who suffered a bullet wound to the head and lost his ability {{to recognize}} his friends, family, and even his own face. However, he was able to recognize and identify them through other sensory modalities such as auditory, tactile, and even other visual stimuli patterns (such as gait and other physical mannerisms). Bodamer gave his paper the title Die Prosop-Agnosie, derived from Classical Greek πρόσωπον (prósōpon) meaning [...] "face" [...] and αγνωσία (agnōsía) meaning [...] "non-knowledge". In October 1996, Bill Choisser proposed using the term <b>face</b> <b>blindness</b> for this condition.

50|$|Delia {{was born}} in February 2009 at the Abbott cabin, with Billy and Lily Winters (Christel Khalil) helping deliver her. Since the character's rapid aging, Delia had been kidnapped, and was later {{diagnosed}} with acute myeloid leukemia and {{was in need of}} a bone marrow transplant. All of her relatives get tested to become her donor, but none are a match. Billy, who had left town after marital problems, was unable to be located to be tested. Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) later found him in prison in Myanmar and brought him home, but enlisted the help of Chloe's boyfriend Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), who would pose as the donor when in fact it would be Billy. The ruse was successful; Delia received the transplant and later recovered from the illness. In 2013, Delia is scheduled to portray the Wicked Witch of the West in her school play of The Wizard of Oz. Billy gets her a dog, whom she names Dash, for the play, angering Chloe. On the way home from the show with Delia in the car, Billy stops at a store to pick up ice cream. While in the store, Delia opens the car door and Dash runs away. She runs out into the road to follow him, and is struck by a black SUV. Billy finds her {{on the side of the}} road and she is brought to the hospital, where she is tragically pronounced dead. Chloe's friend Chelsea Lawson's (Melissa Claire Egan) son Connor is <b>facing</b> <b>blindness</b> and is in need of a cornea transplant. Billy and Chloe offer Delia's corneas to Connor; the transplant is successful and his eyesight is saved.

50|$|Prosopagnosia, {{also called}} <b>face</b> <b>blindness,</b> is a {{cognitive}} disorder of face perception {{in which the}} ability to recognize familiar faces, including one's own face (self-recognition), is impaired, while other aspects of visual processing (e.g., object discrimination) and intellectual functioning (e.g., decision making) remain intact. The term originally referred to a condition following acute brain damage (acquired prosopagnosia), but a congenital or developmental form of the disorder also exists, which may affect up to 2.5% of the United States population. The specific brain area usually associated with prosopagnosia is the fusiform gyrus, which activates specifically in response to faces. The functionality of the fusiform gyrus allows most people to recognize faces in more detail than they do similarly complex inanimate objects. For those with prosopagnosia, the new method for recognizing faces depends on the less-sensitive object recognition system. The right hemisphere fusiform gyrus is more often involved in familiar face recognition than the left. It remains unclear whether the fusiform gyrus is only specific for the recognition of human faces {{or if it is}} also involved in highly trained visual stimuli.|$|E
40|$|We used {{a change}} {{blindness}} paradigm {{to examine the}} "other race" effect in perception. White Caucasian and Indian Asian participants viewed scenes in which White Caucasian and Indian Asian students were present. Changes were made either to {{the faces of the}} students, to their bodies or to an independent object in the background. Changes in faces were detected faster than changes in the bodies, which were in turn detected faster than changes in the background. For face detection there was a crossover interaction, with changes in White Caucasian faces detected faster than changes in Indian Asian faces by White Caucasian participants, whilst the opposite result occurred for changes in Indian Asian faces. In contrast, there was no effect of race on the detection of body-part changes or on the detection of changes to background objects. The results suggest that participants of both races attended equally well to subjects from the other race in the scene, but despite this they remained less sensitive to "other race" <b>faces.</b> Change <b>blindness</b> can provide a useful way of analysing attentional and memorial processes in social contexts. © 2005 Psychology Press Ltd...|$|R

30|$|Of course, {{one could}} argue that linking any {{lessening}} in recognition performance to change detection, especially when recognition is relatively accurate in the <b>face</b> of change <b>blindness,</b> might constitute a relatively low bar for demonstrating some kind of representational failure. As mentioned above, however, it is possible to observe equivalent and above-chance recognition in participants who do and do not detect changes (Angelone et al., 2003). So, if the specific failures documented in research using highly incidental tasks and/or in lab tasks can also be documented in more naturalistic and applied tasks where participants are focusing on material with the goal of learning, then the growing domain of representational failures may begin to encompass a substantial and important segment of visual experience, {{and this is one of}} the key goals of the current project.|$|R
5000|$|Prosopagnosia, {{also called}} <b>face</b> <b>blindness,</b> is a {{disorder}} {{that results in}} the inability to recognize or discriminate between faces. It can often be associated with other forms of recognition impairment, such as place, car, or emotional recognition. [...] A study conducted by Gross et all in 1969 found that certain cells were selective for {{the shape of a}} monkey hand, and they observed that as the stimulus they provided began to further resemble a monkey hand, those cells became more active. A few years later, in 1972, Gross et al. discovered that certain IT cells were selective for faces. Although it is not conclusive, ‘face-selective’ IT cortex cells are assumed to play a large role in facial recognition in monkeys. After the extensive research into the result of damage to the IT cortex in monkeys, it is theorized that lesions in the IT gyrus in humans result in prosopagnosia. Rubens and Benson’s 1971 study of a subject in life with prosopagnosia reveals that the patient is able to name common objects on visual presentation flawlessly, however she cannot recognize faces. Upon necropsy conducted by Benson et al., it was apparent that a discrete lesion in the right fusiform gyrus, a part of the inferior temporal gyrus, {{was one of the main}} causes of the subject’s symptoms.|$|E
50|$|The {{audience}} is introduced to Gina (Lena Headey), a successful radiologist, who is examining x-rays {{of a patient}} with Situs Inversus, an uncommon condition {{in which a person}} is born with their heart and other organs reversed or mirrored from their normal positions. On the birthday of her father, John (Richard Jenkins), Gina, along with her boyfriend Stefan (Melvil Poupaud), her brother Daniel (Asier Newman) and his girlfriend Kate (Michelle Duncan) surprises John in his home. In the middle of the dinner party, a mirror previously knocked askew when John entered the room falls and shatters. Kate and Gina proceeded to clean the shards and discuss that mirrors breaking is a sign of bad luck. At work the next day, Gina was baffled by her assistant Anthony (Damian O'Hare) when he tells her that he saw Gina walking out of the building. Gina explains that she has been inside the whole time. On her way home however, she sees a woman who looks exactly like her driving a car identical to hers. Gina follows the woman to her flat and sees a picture of her and John inside the woman's room. A frightened Gina runs out of the building and drives her car. Seemingly disturbed at what she saw, she collides head on with another truck {{in the middle of the}} road. Gina awakens in a hospital with no memory of the accident. She is introduced to a therapist Dr. Robert Zachman (Ulrich Thomsen). Robert leaves her a calling card and Stefan fetches her out of the hospital. At Stefan's flat, Gina notices his mirror is missing and he explains he broke it by accident. A leakage bothers Gina in the bathroom and goes to check on it in the attic but is stopped by Stefan. Stefan appears to be cold and less emotional than earlier appearances in the film. Stefan's dog also whines at him, and attempts to bite his hand. Gina contacts Robert about her concerns that Stefan is not really her boyfriend. Dr. Zachman suggests this may be a form of Prosopagnosia, or <b>face</b> <b>blindness,</b> brought on by brain damage and memory loss sustained in the car crash. Dr. Zachman advises more tests to be performed, and recommends that Gina visit her wrecked car in hopes that it will help her remember the events surrounding the accident.|$|E

60|$|How ungenerous, {{and even}} cruel, {{it is to}} reproach or ridicule a child for stupidity, is evident when we reflect that any {{supposed}} inferiority in his mental organization can not, by any possibility, be his fault. The question what degree of natural intelligence he shall be endowed with, in comparison with other children, is determined, not by himself, but by his Creator, and depends, probably, upon conditions of organization in his cerebral system as much beyond his control as any thing abnormal in the features of his <b>face,</b> or <b>blindness,</b> or deafness, or any other physical disadvantage. The child who shows any indications of inferiority to others {{in any of these}} respects should be the object of his parent's or his teacher's special tenderness and care.

This difference is initially discussed in a qualitative framework, and then quantified. The survey data showed that many blind and vision-impaired individuals face restrictions on their use of such services as taxis due to their limited financial resources when mitigating the effects of their vision loss.

40|$|SummaryIt {{is unknown}} if the white-matter {{properties}} associated with specific visual networks selectively affect category-specific processing. In a novel protocol we combined measurements of white-matter structure, functional selectivity, and {{behavior in the}} same subjects. We find two parallel white-matter pathways along the ventral temporal lobe connecting to either face-selective or place-selective regions. Diffusion properties of portions of these tracts adjacent to face- and place-selective regions of ventral temporal cortex correlate with behavioral performance for face or place processing, respectively. Strikingly, adults with developmental prosopagnosia (<b>face</b> <b>blindness)</b> express an atypical structure-behavior relationship near face-selective cortex, suggesting that white-matter atypicalities in this region may have behavioral consequences. These data suggest that examining the interplay between cortical function, anatomical connectivity, and visual behavior is integral to understanding functional networks and their role in producing visual abilities and deficits...|$|E
40|$|Many people {{experience}} transient difficulties in recognizing faces {{but only a}} small number of them cannot recognize their family members when meeting them unexpectedly. Such <b>face</b> <b>blindness</b> is associated with serious problems in everyday life. A better understanding of the neuro-functional basis of impaired face recognition may be achieved by a careful comparison with an equally unique object category and by a adding a more realistic setting involving neutral faces as well facial expressions. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neuro-functional basis of perceiving faces and bodies in three developmental prosopagnosics (DP) and matched healthy controls. Our approach involved materials consisting of neutral faces and bodies as well as faces and bodies expressing fear or happiness. The first main result is that the presence of emotional information has a different effect in the patient vs. the control group in the fusiform face area (FFA). Neutral faces trigger lower activation in the DP group, compared to the control group, while activation for facial expressions is the same in both groups. The second main result is that compared to controls, DPs have increased activation for bodies in the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) and for neutral faces in the extrastriate body area (EBA), indicating that body and face sensitive processes are less categorically segregated in DP.

40|$|A {{woman in}} her early 40 s with {{congenital}} prosopagnosia and {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} observed for the first time sudden and extensive improvement of her face recognition abilities, mental imagery, and sense of navigation after galactose intake. This effect of galactose on prosopagnosia has never been reported before. Even if this effect is restricted to a subform of congenital prosopagnosia, galactose might improve the condition of other prosopagnosics. Congenital prosopagnosia, the inability to recognize other people by their face, has extensive negative impact on everyday life. It has a high prevalence of about 2. 5 %. Monosaccharides are known to {{have a positive impact on}} cognitive performance. Here, we report the case of a prosopagnosic woman for whom the daily intake of 5 g of galactose resulted in a remarkable improvement of her lifelong <b>face</b> <b>blindness,</b> along with improved sense of orientation and more vivid mental imagery. All these improvements vanished after discontinuing galactose intake. The self-reported effects of galactose were wide-ranging and remarkably strong but could not be reproduced for 16 other prosopagnosics tested. Indications about heterogeneity within prosopagnosia have been reported; this could explain the difficulty to find similar effects in other prosopagnosics. Detailed analyses of the effects of galactose in prosopagnosia might give more insight into the effects of galactose on human cognition in general. Galactose is cheap and easy to obtain, therefore, a systematic test of its positive effects on other cases of congenital prosopagnosia may be warranted...|$|E

The brothers reunite at their fathers flat and discover to their amusement that they have both recently purchased exactly the same series of stamps from the post office.

Over time, uncontrolled diabetes can leave in its wake people <b>facing</b> renal failure, <b>blindness,</b> and heart disease, and communities daunted by new, chaotic phenomena. Westernized lifestyles are a recognized explanation for the escalating prevalence.

In-depth interviews were conducted with nine elder women to learn: (1) about the factors attributable to diabetes, (2) about related narratives addressing health protection and diabetes prevention, and (3) how knowledge about health protection is shared. The elders saw diabetes as an outside, unnatural disorder, the contributing influences of which are external as well as internal. They offered narratives about chaos, restitution, testimony, and quests for cures and meaning. The elders connected health to traditional values and ways, the land, and memory. Reservoirs of wisdom reside in the knowledge systems of tribal elders who remember when diabetes was unknown.
