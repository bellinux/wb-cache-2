40|$|This paper {{challenges}} the traditional view that nominal classifiers classify individuals. Instead, {{we suggest that}} classifiers coerce nouns to refer to <b>kinds</b> <b>and</b> events {{as well as to}} individuals. This finding argues against the view that nouns refer only to entities, and suggests that classifiers do not simply agree with a noun, but instead coerce a particular meaning from it. Moreover, the Mandarin classifier system creates a taxonomic system involving events, <b>kinds</b> <b>and</b> individuals respectively. Within each classifier type an independent classification system of the collocating noun type is created. These findings are important first because they emphasize that the understanding of the semantics of nouns involves more than simple reference to an individual entity. Second, {{it is the first time}} that the previously abstract semantic distinctions among <b>kinds,</b> individuals <b>and</b> events, as well as within <b>kinds</b> <b>and</b> within events, have been found to be instantiated in a particular system of a natural language grammar...|$|R
