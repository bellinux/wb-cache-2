50|$|Jeff - Jeff {{begins by}} {{installing}} his boxes {{so that they}} are flush {{to the edge of the}} wood, rather than extending them out by a half-inch (to account for the finished wall). When drilling holes in his studs for his electrical, Jeff does not realize that his drill is in reverse, and prompts Fred to try doing what he could not do after a whole minute. Harvey goes through in seconds after setting Jeff's <b>drill</b> <b>back</b> to forward. No further footage of Jeff's work is shown, although he is finished by the time Jaime has finished connecting the solar panels to the sheds. Jeff's electrical work, by the time it is put to the test, fails, giving him an overall failing grade after 2 hours and 45 minutes of work. Jeff's mistake, as found by Rob, was that the wire that connects the lights to his panel is far too loose.|$|R

5|$|Drilling {{boreholes}} {{through the}} Hamilton Group shales in the subsurface can be problematic. The Marcellus has {{a relatively low}} density, and these shales may not be chemically compatible with some drilling fluids. The shale is relatively fragile, and may fracture under pressure, causing a problem in circulating the <b>drilling</b> fluid <b>back</b> up through the borehole known as lost circulation.
