Fly/bottom ashes may be used as a replacement for naturally occurring resources and therefore offer environmental benefits by avoiding the need to quarry or mine these resources.

Different suspensions of nano-objects (with varying material, size and shape) stabilized in aqueous solutions were prepared therefore on different flat substrates.

Due to the structure of the polymer and its specific characteristics, such as the presence of carboxylic groups and CD cavities, the adsorption mechanism involves four main interactions: ion exchange, <b>electrostatic</b> interactions and <b>precipitation</b> for metal removal, and inclusion complexes for organics removal.

40|$|Biochar {{has been}} shown to act as an {{effective}} sorbent for many organic and inorganic contaminants (including phosphate) and can help {{to improve the quality of}} our fresh water resources by preventing eutrophication. Most of the high efficiency biochar phosphate-adsorbent feedstocks are modified with chemical pretreatment, phytoremediation or anaerobic digestion to accumulate desired elements. The main objectives of this project were to first engineer magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) altered biochar by chemical pretreatment followed by pyrolysis at either 350 or 550 °C and evaluate their phosphate adsorption rate and potential as compared to their unaltered counterparts. Determination of surface physiochemical characteristics of the unaltered (U 350 and U 550), Mg-altered (Mg 350 and Mg 550), and Ca-altered (Ca 350 and Ca 550) hardwood biochars was also completed. The unaltered biochars did not adsorb any phosphate which was likely due to a lack of Mg or Ca and crystalline structures as confirmed by ICP-AES and XRD. Adsorption kinetics revealed that both the Ca-altered and Mg-altered biochars took about 10 days to reach equilibrium. The Langmuir isotherm model was the best fitting model for all altered biochars and Mg 550 adsorbed the most phosphate with a Langmuir maximum capacity (Q) of 135. 8 mg/g at pH 9. XRD spectra confirmed crystallinity for both the Ca-altered and Mg-altered biochars for calcite (CaCO 3) on the Ca-altered biochar and both periclase (MgO) and brucite (Mg(OH) 2) on the Mg-altered biochars. SEM images of Mg 550 followed by EDS confirmed the presence of nano-sized flakes on the biochar surface and identified them as the primary phosphate adsorption sites. SEM images of Ca 550 identified globular, rather than flakey structures on the biochar surface and EDS offered further confirmation that these were calcite minerals. Although Ca 350 and Ca 550 adsorbed phosphate from solution, Mg 350 and Mg 550 exhibited a much greater phosphate sorption potential with Q at 18. 91, 16. 34, 39. 59 and 135. 8 mg/g (pH 9), respectively. This may be attributed to the morphological differences between the highly crystalline flake-like structures of the Mg altered biochars and the globular structures on the surface of the Ca altered biochars.

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{modification of}} the Bayer Process is investigated in this PhD Thesis, aiming to save energy. The difference of this new method lies in the precipitation stage during which, monohydrate alumina (boehmite) (Al 2 O 3 ?H 2 O) seeds are added into a supersaturated sodium aluminate solution at 90 oC in order to perform precipitation of boehmite instead of gibbsite. The thermodynamic study of hydrothermal transformation of gibbsite to boehmite proved that boehmite is the thermodynamically stable solid phase of the Al 2 O 3 -Na 2 O-H 2 O ternary system, at temperatures as low as 47, 6 οC depending on the initial caustic concentration. The kinetic study of boehmite precipitation from supersaturated sodium aluminate solutions revealed respectively, that crystalline boehmite can be precipitated from such solutions at temperatures lower than 100 οC. The typical boehmite precipitation curve is characterized by an initially high rate of boehmite precipitation that gradually decreases and the system reaches an apparent equilibrium in which, the alumina concentration in solution is almost twice the boehmite solubility under same conditions. The predominant mechanisms during the first nine hours of precipitation are: surface precipitation and agglomeration, while primary nucleation mechanism dominates afterwards. By studying the electrochemical properties of boehmite-water interface in the alkaline pH range, the observed kinetic inhibitions {{were found to be}} attributed to the negative value of boehmite’s surface potential produced by the negatively charged ?AlO- surface species. As a consequence, the aluminate complex ion, cannot be easily adsorbed to the boehmite surface due to the repulsive <b>electrostatic</b> forces. <b>Precipitation</b> under constant concentration of free caustic in solution and/or using very high initial concentration of boehmite seed in solution, increases the value of surface potential and leads to higher boehmite precipitation rate and yield. Depending on the initial particle size of the boehmite seeds used and the application of continuous recycling of the precipitated solids, boehmite with desirable particle size can be produced. Finally, during the calcination stage, boehmite can be transformed to α-Al 2 O 3, γ-Al 2 O 3 as well as to transition aluminas {{that can be used for}} the production of ceramics, refractories, catalysts and other special materials. ...|$|R
40|$|Fly Ash (FA) is {{obtained}} by <b>electrostatic</b> or mechanical <b>precipitation</b> of dust-like particles from the flue gases of furnace fired with coal or lignite at 1100 to 1400 °C. About 95 - 99 % of Fly Ash consists of oxides of Si, Al, Fe and Ca, about 0. 5 to 3. 5 % consists of Na, P, K and S {{and the remainder}} is composed of trace elements. PFA has also been used as an adsorbing material when applied in treatment effluents. The use of Fly Ash as a chemical conditioner has previously been investigated with results indicating that Fly Ash does facilitate the filtering process since it decreases both specific resistance and capillary suction time. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} paper was to assess the potential of PFA as an ameliorant for soil artificially spiked with various Lead compounds (PbSO 4, PbCO 3, PbNO 3 and PbS). Additions of quicklime and Fly Ash to the contaminated soils effectively reduced heavy metal leachability well below the regulatory limits for hazardous wastes. The results showed the effect of PFA on leaching of lead was significant for all the samples. A high interaction value depicting sampling effect over the use of the PFA as an ameliorant was observed. The order of the difference between samples treated with PFA and without PFA was PbNO 3 > PbSO 4 > PbCO 3 > PbS (17 mg L - 1) when compared to that of the control.

50|$|Shortly after {{returning}} to Berkeley, Cottrell began consulting for the DuPont Company at its explosives- and acids-producing facility near Pinole, California, 20 {{miles north of the}} University. DuPont wanted {{to address the problem of}} precipitating the acid mists which form when sulfur trioxide is bubbled through water or dilute sulfuric acid. Using an electrical method similar to one envisioned by Sir Oliver Lodge in England, Cottrell began experimenting with <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitation</b> as a means of collecting sulfuric acid mists. The result of Cottrell’s work was the electrostatic precipitator, a device which could collect fly ash, dust and fumes, acid mists and fogs that spewed from turn-of-the century plants, and which became a primary means for controlling industrial air pollution. Cottrell made it work by developing a reliable high-voltage power supply and electrodes that permitted electrical energy to leak across a gas-filled chamber from many small points. In 1906, electric current was applied to a small laboratory device emitting sulfuric acid mist, and the concept became a reality. The first patent, No. 895,729, was issued on August 11, 1908. The electrostatic precipitator remains a principal technology for pollutant removal from industrial waste flows to this day.|$|E
50|$|Cottrell {{was not a}} businessman, but he {{recognized}} the business potential of his invention and decided {{to use it to}} fund scientific research through the creation of Research Corporation. In the time before science was routinely funded by government and private sources, Cottrell, at the age of 34, resolved that science would be the principal beneficiary of his invention. Those associated with him in developing <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitation</b> agreed with this highly unusual suggestion, and Cottrell made several attempts to donate the patent to organizations that might market the precipitator, using the proceeds to finance scientific research. After the University of California and the Smithsonian Institution declined his offer, Cottrell worked with then-Secretary of the Smithsonian Charles Doolittle Walcott, to form Research Corporation, a foundation devoted to philanthropy in science. The original board of directors—academics, scientists, lawyers and bankers—invested a total of $10,100 to fund the fledgling organization, and served without compensation. The board of directors shared Cottrell’s goal of acquiring inventions and patents, developing them, making them available to industry under licensing, and applying all profits to support investigations in fundamental scientific research. Within a year, all of the Board’s investments had been repaid and the precipitator business was under way. Cottrell is perhaps best known for this act of philanthropy.|$|E

The work presented in this thesis was focused on the synthesis, characterisation and testing of magnetic nanoparticles and their potential applications. There are a number of magnetic nano-materials prepared for specific applications such as metal oxide nanoparticles encapsulated with various porous materials including Fe₃O₄/Fe₂O₃ coated with soft bio-organic materials such as glycol chitosan and bovine serum albumin and hard materials such as silica (SiO₂) and zinc sulphide (ZnS). The preparation of these materials was achieved principally by bottom-up methods with different approaches including micro-emulsion, <b>precipitation,</b> <b>electrostatic</b> and thermolysis processes. The thesis also presents the uses of various analytical techniques for characterising different types of nano-materials including Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transformer Infrared Vibrational Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), Ultraviolet Visible- Near Infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) Spectroscopy, Zeta Potentiometric Surface Charge Analysis, Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) and Vibration Sample Magnetometry (VSM) for magnetic analysis and powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) for crystallographic pattern analysis. There are many applications of magnetic nanoparticles, including nano-carriers for biological and catalytic reagents. The magnetic nanoparticles can facilitate separation in order to isolate the carriers from solution mixtures as compared to many inefficient and expensive classic methods, which include dialysis membrane, electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, precipitation and column separation methods.

At sufficient field strength, a sharp liquid meniscus forms, which emits a jet of highly charged droplets that drift through the surrounding gas and are collected on the walls of a conductive tube. Particles in the gas have a high probability of contact with the droplets either by adhering to the droplets or otherwise acquiring a high level of charge, causing them to be captured on the collecting electrode as well.

40|$|<b>Electrostatic</b> <b>precipitation</b> {{processes}} {{have been}} widely applied to remove particulate matter from flue gases in coal-fired power stations. A high negative voltage is usually applied to a discharge electrode so that the gases are ionised in such processes. When the suspended particles in flue gases enter the ionised space, they are electrically charged and deposited on collection walls to form a layer of particle packing. Essentially, the underlying working principle of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitation</b> processes is the packing of fine particles under electric fields. Despite the possibility of achieving high collection efficiencies of the precipitation processes through careful tuning of the electrical and aerodynamic conditions, improvements on the removal of fine particulate matter, such as PM 2. 5 have not been achieved. Understanding the formation process of particle packing under electric fields {{is the key to}} improve the collection efficiency of fine particulate matter. Yet, it is mostly impossible to carry out a study on packings of fine particles through practical experiments. In this thesis, we have developed a numerical model based on the discrete element method to simulate packings of fine particles under various electric fields. Both the formed packings under uniform and non-uniform electric fields are comprehensively examined. For the packings under uniform electric fields, the packing structures are characterised in terms of the packing fraction, coordination number, radial distribution function, and Voronoi tessellations. Our results indicate that the particle diameter and electric field are the two important parameters that determine the structure of the formed packings under electric fields. Such observations {{can be explained by the}} competition between the electric-field-induced electrostatic interactions and the interparticle van der Waals interactions during the formation of stable packings. For the packings under non-uniform electric fields, special emphasis is given to the elliptical-shaped packing structural profiles commonly observed in <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitation</b> processes. The results have demonstrated that non-uniform packing structures are formed as a result of the imposed non-uniform electric fields. Despite the non-uniformity of the overall structural profile, the local packing structures are correlated to the local electric fields in terms of packing fraction and coordination number. These findings may lead to better controls of the formed packings under various electric fields. In addition, a novel numerical method to evaluate electrical transport in the formed packings under electric fields is presented. Both the electrical potential and electric current on each and every particle in a packing are numerically solved to obtain the effective electrical conductivity of the packing. Here, the focus is given to the contacts between particles. Our results have shown that the three variables, the material properties of particles, the contact area between particles and packing structures all have determining effects on the effective conductivity. Furthermore, analyses on the electric current network and contact force network have revealed that the electric current flow is significantly influenced by the contact force distribution in a packing. Lastly, two mathematical models, that are applicable to industrial <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitation</b> processes, have been developed to predict the effective conductivity of the formed packings under electric fields. Conventional models predicting the effective conductivity require the use of the structural parameters of packings, such as the packing fraction, coordination number and contact diameter. However, such information is difficult to obtain in industrial applications. In contrast, based on the previously established relations, we have modelled the effective conductivity of packings using only the particle diameter, electric field and packing depth, which are all controllable parameters. Hence, the desirable electrical transport properties of the formed packings under electric fields can be achieved through changing the controllable parameters. Our findings may lead to better design and controls of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitation</b> processes...|$|E

Analysis of charging of micron and sub-micron particles with different conductivies has been conducted using the analytical Cochet approach which takes into account the field and diffusion charging mechanisms.

40|$|Reducing indoor {{exposure}} to influenza particles associated with flu {{can be an}} important strategy to manage residential infections. Many portable air cleaning (PAC) technologies are currently employed in residential environments but very little research has been performed to evaluate and compare their performance in terms of particle removal associated with influenza. This study evaluates the effectiveness of portable air cleaners at removing airborne NaCl particles as an analogue to the influenza virus and applies the results to an IAQ mass balance model to evaluate the performance in controlling residential exposures and mitigating infection risks. Various devices representing different PAC technologies were tested using a pull down particle challenge in a full scale stainless steel chamber. Particle generation and measurement were conducted using a 6 -jet atomizer and a paired aerodynamic particle sizer (APS) -scann ing mobility particle size r (SMPS), respectively. PAC incorporating HEPA filt ration, <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitation,</b> ion generation and electret filtration were tested. We found that particle exposures released during a cough or sneeze event in a typical Canadian residential room can significantly be reduced using HEPA, <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitation</b> and electret filtration PACs when compared with a situation where no PAC is being used. Modelling analysis demonstrates that the use of these PACs can mitigate the risks of influenza infection via airborne route for a caregiver or a spouse sharing the same room. The implications of this study is significant considering low. 9 2011 ASHRAE. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
