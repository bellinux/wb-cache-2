The group {{consists}} of eighteen elected members and it advises and assists the pastor in important decisions concerning {{the affairs of}} the church.

Tara, who was overcome with shyness while speaking during the Wicca meeting, easily expresses courage when touching Willow, and Willow realizes she has finally found someone who understands and shares what she is seeking.|$|E

5|$|With the {{exception}} of Tesla Motors, almost all new cars in the United States are sold through dealerships, so they {{play a crucial role}} in the sales of electric vehicles, and negative attitudes can hinder early adoption of plug-in electric vehicles. Dealers decide which cars they want to stock, and a salesperson can have a big impact on how someone <b>feels</b> <b>about</b> a prospective purchase. Sales people have ample knowledge of internal combustion cars while they do not have time to learn about a technology that represents a fraction of overall sales. As with any new technology, and in the particular case of advanced technology vehicles, retailers are central to ensuring that buyers, especially those switching to a new technology, have the information and support they need to gain the full benefits of adopting this new technology.|$|E
25|$|The plot {{follows a}} {{non-sequential}} structure; it switches from past memories to present experiences, and often entangles the two. This meshing of memory with sensation creates confusion {{between past and}} present, in which no details are concrete. Words and phrases are repeated throughout the book, highlighting themes and recurring ideas. This redundancy generates a sense of obsession throughout the narrative, Erika's obsession to learn the truth, and Hilde's obsession to forget it. Coupled with repetition, Reichart's use of recurring words—such as alone, exclusion, and guilt—emphasize their importance to the main points and the extreme feelings Hilde <b>feels</b> <b>about</b> them.|$|E

She feels that, because she has yet to be the best rhythmic gymnast, Ooishi might fall for Shiina because of her gymnastic skills and talent. Hikari begins to perfect her skills, and is soon competing at the national and international level, where she meets new rivals.|$|E

25|$|Virginia Woolf {{is taking}} her walk while {{thinking}} of ideas for her novel. She already believes Clarissa Dalloway will commit suicide, now Virginia plans for Mrs.Dalloway {{to have had}} one true love: not her husband, but a girl Clarissa knew during her own girlhood. Her love of another girl will have represented {{a time when she}} was not afraid to go against the destiny laid out for her by society and family. Virginia plans for Clarissa to kill herself in middle-age over something quite trivial, a representation of what her life has become and what has been repressed. As Virginia walks about Richmond she reflects on how Mrs.Dalloway's deterioration in middle-age represents how Virginia <b>feels</b> <b>about</b> being trapped in suburban Richmond when she only feels fully alive in London. She is aware she is more susceptible to mental illness in London, but would rather die 'raving mad' in London than avoid life (and perhaps prolong her years) in Richmond.|$|E
25|$|Many tattoos {{serve as}} rites of passage, marks of status and rank, symbols of {{religious}} and spiritual devotion, decorations for bravery, sexual lures and marks of fertility, pledges of love, amulets and talismans, protection, and as punishment, like the marks of outcasts, slaves and convicts. The symbolism and impact of tattoos varies in different places and cultures. Tattoos may show how a person <b>feels</b> <b>about</b> a relative (commonly mother/father or daughter/son) or about an unrelated person. Today, people choose to be tattooed for artistic, cosmetic, sentimental/memorial, religious, and magical reasons, and to symbolize their belonging to or identification with particular groups, including criminal gangs (see criminal tattoos) or a particular ethnic group or law-abiding subculture. Some Māori still choose to wear intricate moko on their faces. In Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, the yantra tattoo is used for protection against evil and to increase luck. Text-based tattoos including quotes, lyrics, personal mottos or scripture are popular in western culture. As an example some Christians might have a Psalm or verse from the Bible tattooed on their body. Popular verses include John 3:16, Philippians 4:13, and Psalms 23.|$|E

At Emily's encouragement, he manages to confront them both about it, and later loses his virginity when Emily decides to have pity sex with him.
