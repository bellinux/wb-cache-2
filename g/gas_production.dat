5|$|About 16hours {{before the}} storm moved through the Lesser Antilles, the {{government}} of Saint Lucia declared a tropical storm warning. Guadeloupe, Martinique, Dominica, St. Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius, Puerto Rico and the U.S Virgin Islands issued tropical storm watches. Combined {{with the threat of}} Hurricane Charley, Bonnie forced the evacuation of 154oil platforms and 32oil rigs. The cease in production was equivalent to over 1.2million barrels of loss in crude oil, or 0.2% of the annual oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas reserves were also limited. The lack of <b>gas</b> <b>production</b> due to the storms was equivalent to 7.4% of the total daily production in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Although 85% {{of world}} crude {{production}} was still coming from Pennsylvania wells in the 1880s, drilling in Russia and Asia began {{to reach the}} world market. Robert Nobel had established his own refining enterprise in the abundant and cheaper Russian oil fields, including the region's first pipeline and the world's first oil tanker. The Paris Rothschilds jumped into the fray providing financing. Additional fields were discovered in Burma and Java. Even more critical, {{the invention of the}} light bulb gradually began to erode the dominance of kerosene for illumination.

5|$|Lethbridge's economy {{developed}} from drift mines opened by Nicholas Sheran in 1874 and the North Western Coal and Navigation Company in 1882. North Western's president was William Lethbridge, from whom the city derives its name. By {{the turn of}} the century, the mines employed about 150 men and producing 300 tonnes of coal each day. In 1896, local collieries were the largest coal producers in the Northwest Territories, with production peaking during World War I. An internment camp was set up at the Exhibition Building in Lethbridge from September 1914 to November 1916. After the war, increasing oil and natural <b>gas</b> <b>production</b> gradually replaced coal production, and the last mine in Lethbridge closed in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Several {{additional}} preparations {{took place}} in addition to tropical cyclone warnings and watches. According to the Federal government of the United States, nearly 25% of crude oil and natural <b>gas</b> <b>production</b> in the Gulf of Mexico was shut down.

On June24, voluntary evacuations were issued for several areas in northwest Florida during the approach of the storm, especially Taylor and Wakulla Counties.

40|$|International audienceWe use a price-based {{methodology}} {{to assess}} the global energy-return-on-investment (EROI) of coal, oil, and gas,fromthe beginning of their reported production (respectively 1800, 1860, and 1890) to 2012. It appears that theEROI of global oil and <b>gas</b> <b>productions</b> reached their maximumvalues in the 1930 s– 40 s, respectively around 50 : 1 and 150 : 1, and have declined subsequently. Furthermore, we suggest that the EROI of global coal production hasnot yet reached its maximumvalue. Based on the originalwork of Dale et al.

Modifications of the originalmodelwere {{needed in order to}} performcalibrationson each of our price-based historical estimates of coal, oil, and gas global EROI. Theoretical modelsreplicate the fact that maximum EROIs of global oil and <b>gas</b> <b>productions</b> have both already been reached whilethis is not the case for coal. In a prospective exercise, the models show the pace of the expected EROIs decreasefor oil and gas in the coming century.

5|$|There {{are large}} {{deposits}} of petroleum (as {{oil and natural}} gas) in rocks beneath the seabed. Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore oil and <b>gas</b> <b>production</b> can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales. Toxic substances such as mercury, lead, and arsenic may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage and oil may be spilt.|$|E
5|$|After {{the storm}} was named, {{officials}} in Texas began making preparations for Don. The University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston issued a level one alert for Don, and city officials began preparing for a possible evacuation. On July 27, oil companies throughout the western Gulf of Mexico began removing non-essential personnel from their rigs and platforms in preparation for Don. The next day, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Anadarko and Apache announced the evacuations {{of some of the}} oil facilities in the area, while Exxon-Mobil began preparing the Baytown Refinery for a possible storm strike. Several oil companies stopped oil production as a result of Don; by midday on July 28, 6.8% of oil production and 2.8% of natural <b>gas</b> <b>production</b> in the Gulf had been shut in ahead of the storm.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) {{was formed}} as a joint venture by British Petroleum and Gulf. Both British Petroleum and Gulf held equal shares in the venture.

Oil production started from Rawdhatain in 1955 and Minagish in 1959. KOC started <b>gas</b> <b>production</b> in 1964.

40|$|In North Texas, the Barnett Shale {{underlies}} {{large areas}} of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex (DFW), which magnifies debates about the externalities of shale gas development (SGD). Continued demand for natural gas and expansive urbanization in DFW will cause more people to come in contact with drilling rigs, gas transport, and other urban shale gas landscapes. Thousands of gas wells within the DFW region occupy a large, yet scattered land surface area. DFW city planners, elected officials, and other stakeholders must deal with current and future urban growth and the surface impacts that are associated with gas development. This research examines how shale gas landscapes affect urban land uses, landscapes, and patterns of development in DFW. The study focuses on multiple fast growing DFW municipalities that also have high numbers of gas well pad sites.

Storm warnings were broadcast in seven languages, {{a response to}} there being only English and Arabic warnings during Cyclone Gonu, which struck Oman in 2007. Residents were advised to remain away from the rough seas during the storm. Businesses and schools were shut down in the areas the storm affected, with schools operating as emergency shelters near Muscat. About 85% of the isolated Masirah Island was evacuated; the passage of Phet and subsequent storms affecting the Arabian Peninsula influenced the Omani government's decision to build a fixed link with the island 40km (25mi) offshore.
