Romance studies departments usually include the study of Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese. Additional languages of study include Romanian and Catalan, on one hand, and culture, history, and politics on the other hand.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in cultural research and human emotions is the lack of diversity in samples. Currently, the research literature is dominated by comparisons between Western (usually American) and Eastern Asian (usually Japanese or Chinese) sample groups. This limits our understanding of how emotions vary and future studies should include more countries in their analyses.Another challenge outlined by Matsumoto (1990) [...] is <b>that</b> <b>culture</b> is ever changing and dynamic. Culture is not static. As the cultures continue to evolve it is necessary that research capture these changes. Identifying a culture as [...] "collectivistic" [...] or [...] "individualistic" [...] can provide a stable as well as inaccurate picture of what is really taking place. No one culture is purely collectivistic or individualistic and labeling a culture with these terms does not help account for the cultural differences that exist in emotions. As Matsumoto argues, a more contemporary view of cultural relations reveals <b>that</b> <b>culture</b> is more complex than previously thought. Translation is also a key issue whenever <b>cultures</b> <b>that</b> <b>speak</b> different languages are included in a study. Finding words to describe emotions that have comparable definitions in other languages can be very challenging. For example, happiness, which {{is considered one of the}} six basic emotions, in English has a very positive and exuberant meaning. In Hindi, Sukhi is a similar term however it refers to peace and happiness. Although happiness is a part of both definitions, the interpretation of both terms could lead to researchers to making assumptions about happiness that actually do not exist.|$|R
50|$|Standing at 6 ft, scholar Fouad Ajami {{describes}} Sadr's {{charisma and}} magnetism as such: Lebanon {{has long been}} a country finicky about the looks, the aura, al haiba of a leader. The Shia in particular have been noted to be a people of some vanity. In the Shia tradition, the Imams were not only morally infallible men (an Imam was said to be masum, not subject to error), but also physically perfect beings. A blind man or a lame man would not have been accepted as an Imam. Musa al Sadr, a handsome man of striking looks, was true to his people's fantasy of what a man of piety and distinction and high birth slated for bigger things should look like. He was, in addition, a dazzling speaker in a <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> exalted the <b>spoken</b> word and those who could express in classical Arabic what was on the minds of others.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{applications}} are available {{that are designed to}} enhance student engagement in the classroom through the use of Tablet PCs. The value of this goal is well documented, and researchers working with applications such as Classroom Presenter and DyKnow Vision have blazed the way in studying not only how best to deploy this technology, but also how to best teach with it in actual classrooms. Our own experiments with Tablet PCs using Classroom Presenter have identified three issues that we address in this paper: (1) the combining of digital ink from multiple students into a single display so that one can quickly {{get a sense of the}} overall classroom response, (2) the storing of digital ink so that it can be recalled later in a structured manner, and (3) the reliable sharing of digital ink between systems so that absolutely no strokes are lost due to transmission errors. ENGAGEMENT VIA DIGITAL INK Professors often try to engage students by asking questions. It is not uncommon, however, for only a few students to respond. Some remain silent because they’re afraid to make a mistake in front of their peers. Some hate drawing attention to themselves. Some lack confidence in their English. And some, especially those brought up outside the U. S., come from <b>cultures</b> <b>that</b> eschew <b>speaking</b> unless spoken to directly, particularly when in the presence of an authority figure such as a professor...|$|R

In a <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> aligns verbal mastery with social standing, verbal animals present a conundrum <b>that</b> <b>speaks</b> to an anxiety about human communication. I argue that the earliest examples of speaking animals, in Homer, Hesiod and Archilochus, show a fundamental connection with Golden Age tales. Later authors, such as Plutarch and Lucian, look back on such cases from a perspective that does not easily accept notions of divine causation that would permit such fanciful modes of communication. I argue that Plutarch uses a talking pig to challenge philosophical categories, and that Lucian transforms a sham-philosopher of a talking-cock to undermine the very pretense of philosophical virtue...|$|R
