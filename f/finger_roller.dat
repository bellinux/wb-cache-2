50|$|In 2000, Ford of Brazil {{developed}} a cheaper {{version of the}} Zetec-S engine with single cam and 8 valves driven by a chain. As a result, this engine exhibits rougher behaviour, producing more vibration and noise. On the other hand, it has a superb torque output thanks to {{the addition of the}} Rocam (<b>roller</b> <b>finger</b> camshaft) feature.|$|R
40|$|A low friction, object guidance, and {{gripping}} finger {{device for}} a robotic end effector on a robotic arm is disclosed, having {{a pair of}} robotic fingers each having a finger shaft slideably located on a gripper housing attached to the end effector. Each of the robotic <b>fingers</b> has a <b>roller</b> housing attached to the <b>finger</b> shaft.

50|$|The F154 V8 engines have a 90° angle {{between the}} {{cylinder}} banks, aluminium block and heads. The forced induction system uses two parallel twin-scroll water-cooled turbochargers supplied by IHI and two air-to-air intercoolers. The valvetrain consists of 32 valves actuated through <b>roller</b> <b>finger</b> followers by two overhead camshafts per bank; the timing chain {{is located on}} the flywheel side. All versions feature gasoline direct injection and continuously variable valve timing on both intake and exhaust side.|$|R
5000|$|The Coyote {{features}} all new 4V DOHC {{cylinder heads}} that have shifted the camshafts outboard, which {{allowed for a}} compact <b>roller</b> <b>finger</b> follower setup with remote hydraulic valve lash adjusters and improved (raised) intake port geometry. The result is an intake port that outflows the Ford GT intake port by 4 percent and the Yates D3 (NASCAR) intake port up to 0.472" [...] (12 mm) lift, which is the maximum lift of the Coyote's intake cams. Engine redline is 7000 rpm.|$|R
60|$|The Slab is a {{piece of}} thick plate glass, of the same length and width as the handle to the roller, so they pack up easily together; its edges are ground to save the <b>fingers</b> and <b>roller</b> alike from being cut. (Porcelain takes the ink better than glass, but is not to be {{commonly}} found in the shops, of a convenient shape and size; a glazed tile makes a capital slab.) A collapsible tube of printer's ink, a few rags, and a phial of washing soda, complete the equipment (benzole may spoil india-rubber). When using the apparatus, spread a newspaper on the table to prevent accident, have other pieces of newspaper ready to clean the roller, and to remove any surplus of ink from it by the simple process of rolling it on the paper. Take care that the washing soda is in such a position that it cannot be upset and ruin the polish of the table. With these precautions, the apparatus may be used with cleanliness even in a drawing-room. The roller is of course laid on its back when not in use.|$|R
50|$|Clarke and his {{engineers}} studied engine designs {{from major}} European and Japanese automakers {{and sought to}} develop a V8 that was technologically advanced and power-dense, yet also dependable with no major service required before 100,000 miles of use. The initial engine design would implement a 90° vee-angle with a bore of 90.2 mm (3.552 in) and a stroke of 90 mm (3.543 in), resulting in a 4.6-liter (4601 cc, 281 CID) displacement and creating a nearly 1:1 bore-to-stroke ratio. This square configuration was chosen primarily for its positive noise, vibration and harshness characteristics. The engine would utilize features such as a chain-driven, single-overhead camshaft valvetrain with <b>roller</b> <b>finger</b> followers, a deep-skirt cast-iron block construction and cross-bolted main bearings, all benefitting long-term durability. In the interest of reducing overall engine weight, aluminum-alloy heads and pistons would be standard and all major engine accessories would be mounted directly to the block, resulting in more complex block casting but {{eliminating the need for}} heavy mounting brackets. Tight construction tolerances were used in shaping the engine’s cylinder bores with narrow piston rings fitted to the engine’s pistons. This would serve to improve engine efficiency through reduced friction and reduce the engine’s oil consumption, while also promoting cleaner emissions.|$|R
5000|$|The F160 is a 60° V6 {{gasoline}} engine that displaces [...] It utilizes a turbocharger for each cylinder bank, twin intercoolers and direct injection. The engine is designed by Ferrari (loosely based on Pentastar engine block) and assembled by Ferrari; specifically, the engine blocks are cast and machined to Ferrari's approved specifications respectively in Chrysler's Kokomo, Indiana and Trenton Engine Plant, then shipped to Modena, Italy for assembly by Ferrari. This engine shares bore and combustion chamber design, the same valves control technology (i.e. <b>roller</b> <b>finger</b> followers and four cam phasers), the same twin turbocharging approach and direct injection-ignition system with Ferrari F154 engine. The engine auxiliaries are identical (alternator, starter motor and power steering pump) or very similar (variable displacement oil pump). The difference of F160 from F154: F160 engine block {{is made by}} high pressure die cast (HPDC) process which is extremely suitable for high volume production. However, it is open deck type and can't endure to high specific power in HP/liter. F160 doesn't have an overboost function and is not used in Ferrari cars either (both F136 and F154 engines are used in Ferrari cars as well). Ferrari was responsible for design and bench testing of this engine.|$|R
5000|$|Moraz {{was born}} on 24 June 1948 in Morges, Switzerland into a musical family. His father {{used to work for}} Polish pianist and {{composer}} Ignacy Jan Paderewski. As a child, he played the violin, piano, and percussion and wrote compositions for the piano at the age of five. He studied jazz and classical music until his development came to an abrupt halt at thirteen after he broke four <b>fingers</b> in a <b>roller</b> skating accident. He recalled, [...] "I was told I could never play classical music again". Following a course of therapy and a considerable amount of practice with his left hand playing, Moraz was able to regain his technique, becoming ambidextrous in the process. Initially, Moraz wished to be an anthropologist and learned to speak Greek and Latin. Instead he chose to pursue music and studied in Lausanne at the Lausanne Conservatory, where he studied with Clara Haskil and, while in Paris, Nadia Boulanger. At sixteen, Moraz became the youngest person to receive the Best Soloist award at the Zurich jazz festival. Moraz went on to win awards at the festival, as a solo artist or in his jazz groups, for five consecutive years. In 1964, Moraz spent his summer in Cadaques, Spain as a scuba diving instructor and spent time with Salvador Dali at his property in Portlligat where he organised and performed at several gatherings for his guests.|$|R
50|$|The engine's {{displacement}} is 1,598 cc {{and it has}} a bore/stroke {{ratio of}} 79.7/80.1 mm, attaining cylinder pressures of 180 bar and a compression ratio of 16:1. It uses an aluminum engine block, die-cast aluminum bedplate, and am aluminum cylinder head. A chain-driven dual overhead camshaft with dual continuous variable cam phasing, employing weight-saving hollow sections and lobes, operates four valves per cylinder with low-friction, hydraulic <b>roller</b> <b>finger</b> followers. The pistons are made from aluminum for reduced reciprocating mass, feature a concave, shallow-bowl profile to facilitate efficient combustion, and are cooled by under-skirt oil spraying. The crankshaft employs four counterweights to minimize mass, and both it and the con-rods are made of forged steel. The engine features multiple improvements to reduce NVH, such as a cam cover made of GRP and fully decoupled from the engine to reduce noise and vibration, while also saving weight compared to aluminum; a composite intake manifold encapsulated in acoustic padding as well as an external plastic shield that both significantly reduce noise emissions; a mechanical crankshaft isolator which reduces radiated noise and torsional vibrations in the accessory drive system; and scissor gears for the timing drive system, incorporating tooth profiles ground with a Low Noise Shifting (LNS) process for optimal noise reduction. More than 150 patented diesel control functions are deployed by the engine's ECU, which was developed in-house by General Motors and jointly engineered in Italy (by GM Powertrain Torino), Germany, and the United States, and will be used in all future GM four-cylinder diesel engines.|$|R
