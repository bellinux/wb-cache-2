The workshop focussed on implementation and control issues related to the identification and measure of landscape features and buffer strips, as well as on scientific references for definition and mapping of soil related issues (e. g. soil erosion or soil organic matter). Participants also showed much interest on technical aspects related to the implementation of the future CAP with particular reference to landscape features in the framework of the so-called <b>Ecological</b> <b>Focus</b> <b>Area.</b> The workshop allows setting up and fine-tuning future main JRC activities taking into account DG AGRI and Member States inputs.

40|$|The 2014 - 2020 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform defines {{new rules}} for farmers {{including}} {{maintenance of the}} <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>area</b> (EFA). Sustainability is also a requirement to meet consumer expectations and a competitive advantage for firms. This paper aims to evaluate the farmers’ intention to implement sustainable practices related to the EFA measure and to the private sustainability schemes proposed by the food industry. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was applied on a sample of durum wheat producers to analyse intentions 1) to maintain 7 % of the arable land as an EFA, and 2) to implement the private sustainability scheme. Structural equation modelling was applied to test for {{the relative importance of}} intention determinants. The farmers’ attitude and past behaviour positively affect intentions to implement the EFA, while perceived behavioural control and attitudes predict intentions to adopt the private sustainability scheme. These results suggest possible interventions that public authorities and supply chain leaders might implement to stimulate farmers’ sustainable behaviours.  </p...|$|E
40|$|In Wallonia, {{organic farming}} {{continues}} to increase its share of agricultural activities, the number of organic farmers exceeding {{for the first time}} 10 % {{of the total number of}} farmers in 2014, with 8. 6 % of the total agricultural area. Meadows represent 83 % of the organic areas, general crops 15 % and vegetables 1 %. The number of cattle heads is still increasing, while poultry and laying hen recorded a significant progress during the last years. Organic products consumption is also increasing and the market share of organic products in food products reached 2. 3 % in 2014. On the other hand, the implementation of the new Common Agricultural Policy, and particularly its green payment, obliges 50 % of Walloon farmers to practice crop diversification and 46 % to have at least 5 % of <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>area</b> within their arable land in 2015, which represents more than 24, 000 ha.

30|$|The UBA’s {{thoughts}} regarding {{compensation measures}} for the indirect effects of PPPs on biodiversity have been vehemently {{rejected by the}} conventional farming associations and PPP producers. They draw attention in a joint position paper {{to the fact that}} the greening requirements of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) also serve to protect biodiversity, e.g., the requirement for 5 % <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas.</b> They also argue that “the protection of biodiversity is already addressed in a variety of ways by the environmental and agricultural policies.” [62]. However, neither the dedication of 5 % of arable land as <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas</b> in accordance with the CAP greening, nor the agro-environment measures from the CAP “second pillar” are sufficient to protect biodiversity in landscapes which are heavily affected by agriculture, as is required under German plant protection legislation ([63], see also: 21). It is true that the <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas</b> in accordance with CAP can also be effective for the proposed PPP-specific application requirement for the protection of biodiversity. Therefore, the UBA supports the corresponding recommendation of the NAP Forum from December 2014 (see further above).|$|R
40|$|Over {{large parts}} of Europe, {{biodiversity}} loss on farmland is an urgent problem. A suggested answer is to demand from farmers to implement <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas.</b> Within the EU it is discussed how high the proportion of such <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas</b> should be and of which quality they have to be. In Switzerland, since 15 years <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas</b> are mandatory and the topic of several research projects. As a “report on work in progress”, this article outlines some current studies of the Swiss Ornithological Institute on the subject “Effects of <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas</b> on agricultural birds”. The mean proportion of <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas</b> on the utilised agricultural area in the Swiss lowland is 9. 5 %. Nevertheless, no substantial improvement of population sizes of typical farmland species is seen on a national scale. Research shows that, besides quantity, mainly the ecological quality of the <b>focus</b> <b>areas</b> {{is essential for the}} occurrence of many bird species. Thereby, the accessibility of food is an important factor for birds. Sparse vegetation as well as succession play a key role. For example, densities of some farmland bird species are highest in four to six year old wildflower areas/strips. Several case studies show that populations of some farmland bird species benefit from <b>focus</b> <b>areas</b> of high <b>ecological</b> quality. Based on statistical models, about 14 % of high value habitat (<b>focus</b> <b>areas</b> with high <b>ecological</b> quality, semi-natural habitat outside the utilised agricultural area) is necessary in Swiss arable regions to increase populations of typical bird species to considerable densities. Farmers play a decisive role for the realisation of options promoting biodiversity. We could show that farmers, who got an advisory service providing whole-farm solutions optimising ecological and economic aspects, increase their biodiversity performance. The 24 advised farmers in the project agreed to increase the proportion of <b>focus</b> <b>areas</b> with high quality on their farms from 3. 3 % to 8. 7 % of the utilised agricultural area. Within the same project a tool was developed that is used to score the different options promoting biodiversity. An evaluation of this credit-point-system on 133 farms shows that the point score is an adequate and objective proxy for the biodiversity performance of farms. In Switzerland, there is a strong demand for ecological and environmental friendly produced label products. The Swiss organisation for integrated farming (IP-Suisse) focuses on the promotion of biodiversity and demands a certain ecological performance from all its producers, which is measured with the above-mentioned credit-point-system. Thus, biodiversity is an added value that can be turned into financial benefit for producers by higher prices...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas</b> are one {{of three}} {{greening}} measures that were introduced into the European Common Agricultural Policy by the reform in 2014, {{with the aim of}} enhancing the ecological function of agricultural landscapes. However, there are concerns that they will provide little or no ecological benefit as those that are declared may already exist and/or any new areas will be implemented on the basis of farm management burdens rather than ecological criteria, such as those which are the easiest or least costly to implement. To implement <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas</b> to achieve greater benefits requires taking account of numerous spatial and management parameters, scientific understanding of ecosystem services, and the needs and behaviour individual and communities of species.

This paper describes the development of an indicator framework which aims to distil this complex scientific information to aid decision making with regard to the implementation of <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas</b> to enhance and increase benefits for ecosystem services and biodiversity. It involved collating scientific evidence from over 350 papers, reports and guides and then structuring this evidence to form the indicator framework. 230 impacts were identified for 20 land uses and landscape features, and these are characterised using 138 parameters and attributes, containing 708 descriptive classes. The framework provides level of detail that captures the most important factors that affect potential impacts without being overly burdensome in terms of utilisation within decision making processes. The framework aims to help land managers identify the potential benefits and burdens of different options for the specific spatial and management context of their farm, thus enabling them to select those with greatest benefits and least burden for their circumstances. <b>Ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas</b> are part of the first evolution of greening measures, so there is little doubt there is scope to improve them to make their implementation more <b>ecological</b> and more <b>focused.</b> Tools, such as the indicator framework presented herein, can support this process by educating and raising awareness of potential impacts, thus facilitating the transfer of scientific knowledge and resulting in a more ecological aware industry.

40|$|A crucial {{element of}} the post- 2013 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform is the ‘greening’ payment. ‘Greening’ is a {{compulsory}} {{part of the new}} direct payment scheme, accounting for 30 per cent of national ceilings. To qualify, farmers must undertake compulsory agricultural practices that are ‘beneficial for the climate and the environment’, comprising crop diversification, maintenance of existing permanent grassland and establishing an <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>area</b> or putting in place ‘equivalent measures’. The payment had a controversial legislative passage, with several environmental groups questioning its pro-environmental effects and alleging that it was merely a clever way of disguising product support to European Union (EU) farmers, even before several of the provisions were watered down by the European Parliament. Despite these difficulties, throughout the process all parties assumed the ‘greening’ payment was compatible with the Green Box exemption in the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), so that it would be exempt from the EU’s domestic support reduction commitments in that Agreement. Specifically, it was understood that the payment would be decoupled income support under paragraph 6 of Annex 2 to the AoA and as such the payment had ‘no, or at most minimal trade-distorting effects or effects on production’ under paragraph 1 of the same Annex (the so-called ‘fundamental requirement’) ...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} 2013, a new Common Agricultural Policy {{was defined}} at the European level, {{including}} {{the implementation of the}} so-called “green payment”, which obliges farmers to respect three new conditions in order to get financial support through direct payments. The year 2015 being the first implementation year, the consequences on Walloon agriculture are examined. It appears that 50 % of Walloon farmers are not obliged to practice crop diversification, while 16 % are obliged to have at least two crops on their arable land and 33 % are obliged to have at least three crops on their arable land. Less than 1 % does not respect the new diversification rules. Concerning the obligation to have at least 5 % of <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>area</b> on the arable land, it appears that 54 % of Walloon farmers are in conditions not to be obliged to respect the measure. When they implement the measure, the percentage of ecological focus areas in arable land reaches 6. 9 % as a mean and 2. 4 % do not reach the requested 5 %.

40|$|This {{study is}} a first attempt to use the EFA (<b>Ecological</b> <b>Focus</b> <b>Area)</b> {{calculator}} {{as a tool to}} support an assessment of policy impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services of the EFA implementation at European level. Potential impacts at NUTS 3 level were calculated using the data on EFA implementation in 2015. Results show the existence of a clear correspondence between potential impacts and EFA types declared. Impact scores for biodiversity demonstrate that NUTS 3 regions where landscape features represent more than 50 % of EFA declared could perform much better than the others while for some specific ecosystem services also other NUTS 3 regions show good positive potential impacts: it is the case for the NUTS 3 regions where catch crops constitute more than 70 % of the EFA declared for the ecosystem service chemical condition of freshwaters, or NUTS 3 regions with more than 70 % of fallow land declared as EFA for the ecosystem service pollination. By overlaying results obtaiend with the EFA calculator with other sources of information (such as the presence of semi-natural vegetation or water erosion risk areas) it is possible to highlight areas where the policy implementation shows different grades of potential effectiveness.

40|$|The {{reformed}} Common Agricultural Policy {{includes a}} mandatory "greening" component for direct payments, implementation {{of which will}} start in 2015. Two of the three measures introduced (crop diversification and <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>area)</b> will not be applied in holdings with arable land below specific thresholds (10, 15 and 30 ha). This paper uses statistical data of different territories and agricultural systems {{in order to assess}} the possible impacts of these exclusions. It investigates if and in which regions this exemption may generate a theoretical loss of environmental effectiveness, depending on farming systems and current level of semi-natural vegetation. The analysis sketches a complex picture and highlights the regions where the exclusion from these two measures may generate greater issues. Noticeably, in all regions where there is a major prevalence of specialist cereals farming systems, these greening measures concern over half of all arable land. Regions with current low values of semi-natural vegetation where more than half of arable land are exempted from greening are relatively few. Member states may consider adopting specific targeted policy in these regions Applying a set of decision thresholds to fine-tune the analysis, the GIS created {{could be used as a}} decision support tool by national authorities.

40|$|Increasing {{pressures}} on natural areas and limited conservation budgets require, particularly in rural landscapes in the Western world, an immediate {{answer to the}} question how much natural area is required to provide a sustainable future for wild plant and animal species on farmland. The European Union proposed in its Common Agricultural Policy that 3 – 7 % of EU farmland should be managed as <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>area</b> (EFA) in order to halt biodiversity loss. For the first time, we empirically assessed the implications of this policy by evaluating the effects of the density of natural elements in agricultural landscapes on multi-taxon species richness, including vascular plants, breeding birds, butterflies, hoverflies, dragonflies, and grasshoppers for an entire European country. We found that species richness increased either as linear or as a logarithmic function of the proportion of natural elements in the landscape, but not with a sigmoid function as predicted by the ‘intermediate landscape complexity’ hypothesis. Even landscapes with 3 – 7 % of natural elements harboured generally 37 – 75 % of maximum species richness, indicating good potential of implementing the CAP target to preserve farmland biodiversity. However, differences between the 3 and 7 % limits were considerable for butterflies, birds, and hoverflies. Also, the shape of the species richness response was shown to differ between landscape types for butterflies. Thus, {{it may be necessary to}} develop tailor-made guidelines at regional levels...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{reform in}} the European Union {{introduced}} a new element: greening. The aim of greening is to support the environment and create non-productive value in agriculture. The main element of greening is the <b>Ecological</b> <b>Focus</b> <b>Area</b> (EFA) meaning that a portion of farmland area has to be designed for environmental purposes. This article consists of an evaluatation of greening and its elements {{in the first year}} CAP reform has come into force. Surveys were used as a tool to gather information about farm characteristics, ways to meet greening requirements as well as the opinions of farmers as to changes in direct subsidies and greening obligations. The research was conducted in 2015 directly interviewing 290 farmers from the whole of Poland. The farmers interviewed lived {{in different parts of the}} country and had different size farms. Data was prepared with the use of spreadsheets and were analysed using the R statistical program and the “gmodel” and “vcd” statistical packages were used during the calculations. Polish farmers are against greening. Greening does not significantly change the way farmers run their farms. They choose the cheapest options of EFA which are usually not the best for the environment. Furthermore, farmers have to bear the cost of introducing the new elements themselves. Despite a high number of environmental and agricultural advantages offered by new farming methods, crop rotation and after-crop sowing duty, CAP reform is assessed in a negative light. As a result of negative opinions held by farmers due to the lack of subsidies, farmers may not continue greening practices in the future...|$|E

Montpellier, France. 23 - 25 May 2016. Marie Gosme Eds., ISBN 978 - 2 - 87614 - 717 - 1 Farming has a significant {{role to play in}} the delivery of a number of desirable outcomes, including ecosystem services and biodiversity. Regardless of past agri-environmental policy and its intentions, there are still ongoing ecological problems that need attention, as demonstrated by the decline in populations of birds and mammals across the EU. <b>Ecological</b> <b>Focus</b> <b>Areas</b> (EFAs) have been introduced as part of the so called 'greening' measures of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Member States can select (activate) the elements that they wish to be applicable within the area for which they are the competent authority. Agroforestry (intercropping) has been activated in 12 MSs. Eligible farms, those with an arable area 15 ha or more, select from the EFAs activated in their Member State. They need to account for 5 % by area of the total arable land declared, including fallow land, temporary grassland and crop land. It does not include permanent grassland or permanent crops. The introduction of <b>Ecological</b> <b>Focus</b> <b>Areas</b> (EFAs) on the farm has potential to deliver tangible environmental improvements. It is also recognised however, that the extent of such improvements, and so the success of the policy, will ultimately depend on the specific EFA elements selected in addition to farm specific factors. To address this issue, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) commissioned a project to develop a software tool to help farmers select EFA elements that can deliver the optimal environmental benefits. It needed to consider the site specific characteristics of individual farms, and the pragmatic requirements of ensuring that the EFA solution overall was realistic in terms of farm management. The software developed, the EFA calculator, is a standalone Windows application freely available to download from [URL] The calculator determines the potential impact of each EFA feature on ecosystem services, biodiversity and farm management. For each feature-impact, a set of parameters (and classes within those parameters) are derived and then used to determine the relative significance of the impact of that feature on the specified impact. A bespoke scoring system has been developed, which although relatively simple, distils complex and data intensive parameters into a readily interpretable and user friendly format.

40|$|The {{most recent}} National Forest Inventory (Th Institute of Forest Ecosystems, National Forest Inventory) subdivides the areas not devoted to short {{rotation}} coppice (SRC) as follows: Aspen 81, 000 ha, black poplar & hybrid varieties 38, 500 ha, grey poplar 5, 500 ha, white poplar 2, 600 ha, balsam poplar 19, 200 ha, in total 147, 000 ha. During the period under review, the area cultivated by poplars and willows as SRC has hardly extended. Several factors are responsible for this: attractive alternative crops, in particular maize production for biogas, combined with the far-reaching ban on converting grassland {{and a lack of}} incentives from the Regulation on Greening decided at EU level in 2014. With regard to the cultivation of poplars and willows greening stipulates that their cultivation as SRC or agro-forestry-system may be counted as <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>area,</b> yet only with a factor of 0. 3. The total SRC surface in Germany has hence only increased to some 7, 000 hectares and is currently almost stagnating. The woody biomass of approx. 50, 000 t that is annually produced in SRCs is insignificant as compared to the quantities of fuel wood used in private households of 34 million m 3 and the imported wood pellets, which amount to several million tonnes. Efforts have been continued to preserve the remaining pure black poplar occurrences, consisting mostly of relict stands with over-mature trees through in situ and ex situ measures and to approve black poplar stands for harvesting reproductive material for conservation purposes in accordance with the Act on Forest Reproductive Material (Forstvermehrungsgutgesetz - FoVG). Using molecular-genetic methods the species purity of the reproductive material is safeguarded. For 11 of the 14 poplar species, species-specific SNPs/InDels in the chloroplast genome and for identification of poplar cultivars sets of genetic markers have also been developed. For the identification of cultivars of the Section Populus 24 nuclear SSRs and for the identification of willow cultivars 12 nuclear SSRs were established, which are developed further continually. These markers also facilitate the unequivocal identification of multiple hybrid varieties and the resolution of the genealogy of hybrids up to the parental generation. Under the provisions of the Act on Forest Reproductive Material three poplar clones, Matrix 11, 24, and 49 from the Northwest German Forest Research Station (NW-FVA) and four hybrid aspen cultivars and two hybrid aspen families (in each case P. tremula 7 P. tremuloides) by the Th Institute for Forest Genetics, Grosshansdorf, were approved for the production of forest reproductive material in the category "Tested". Over 50 research projects, carried out at 26 institutions on genetics and breeding, cultivation, physiology, resistance of poplar and willows as well as wood utilisation were funded by third parties and have been included in the report. Also, over 180 scientific publications and seven book titles are listed in the report.

A life-cycle analysis approach derives greenhouse gas emissions for 18 key representative options, accounting for spatial environmental variables (annual precipitation, soil type and erosion risk). Findings ??? Most options achieve an absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to an existing arable crop baseline but at the expense of removing land from production, risking production displacement. Soil and water protection options designed to reduce soil erosion and nitrate leaching decrease greenhouse gas emissions without loss of crop yield. Undersown spring cereals support decreased inputs and emissions per unit of crop yield. The most valuable agri-environment options identified are included in the proposed <b>Ecological</b> <b>Focus</b> <b>Areas,</b> although lower priority is afforded to some. Originality/value ???

Eligible farms must have a minimum arable area (including fallow land, temporary grassland and crop land) of 15 ha, for which EFAs need to comprise 5 % of this area. The overall environmental benefits delivered by a given EFA option will depend on farm specific factors, and will vary between farms and Member States. In order to help account for this variability, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) commissioned the development of a software tool, the EFA calculator, to assist land managers in the selection of EFA elements appropriate to their farm, in order to optimise ecosystem services, biodiversity and farm management. A simple bespoke scoring system underpins the calculator but enables the distillation of complex and data-intensive parameters into a readily interpretable and user friendly format. Although multiple ecosystem services are accounted for by the tool, this paper will focus on pest control, specifically the impact of EFAs on ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and their potential role as beneficial insects. Crop cover, frequency of cultivation, field size and the quality and connectedness of field boundaries are key factors taken into account...|$|R

The analysis is based on scenarios with a spatially explicit rural agent-based model (SERA) that explicitly models farmers, their socio-economic decision-making, their land use, and the landscape of which they are part. The first part of the analysis focuses on the effects of environmental cooperative collective decision-making for implementation of the ‘greening measure’ <b>Ecological</b> <b>Focus</b> <b>Areas</b> (EFAs). The second part of the analysis focuses on the interest of collective agri-environment measures. Results show that ways through which EFAs are allocated are crucial for effectiveness of cooperative approaches. Relying on simple market oriented governance structures will not by definition result in a better allocation of EFAs in a region. Results show that when the environmental cooperative is a key player in the designation and allocation of Pillar II agri-environment schemes, farmland biodiversity potentially increases because local expert knowledge on favorable ecological sites can be used for optimal allocation of the scheme...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ecological</b> <b>Focus</b> <b>Areas</b> (EFAs) {{are one of}} {{the three}} new {{greening}} measures of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). We used an interdisciplinary and European-scale approach to evaluate ecological effectiveness and farmers‟ perception of the different EFA options. We assessed potential benefits of EFA options for biodiversity using a survey among 88 ecologists from 17 European countries. We further analyzed data on EFA uptake at the EU level and in eight EU Member States, and reviewed socio-economic factors influencing farmers‟ decisions. We then identified possible ways to improve EFAs. Ecologists scored field margins, buffer strips, fallow land, and landscape features as most beneficial whereas farmers mostly implemented „catch crops and green cover‟, nitrogen-fixing crops, and fallow land. Based on the expert inputs and a review of the factors influencing farmers‟ decisions, we suggest that EFA implementation could be improved by a) prioritizing EFA options that promote biodiversity (e. g. reducing the weight or even excluding ineffective options); b) reducing administrative constraints; c) setting stricter management requirements (e. g. limiting agrochemical use); and d) offering further incentives for expanding options like landscape features and buffer strips. We finally propose further improvements at the next CAP reform, to improve ecological effectiveness and cost-effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} the result of the work of the EIP AGRI Focus Group (FG) on <b>Ecological</b> <b>Focus</b> <b>Areas</b> (EFAs) and more {{specifically}} on how landscape features (LFs) contribute to the profitability of arable crop production. The scientific literature shows that LFs provide habitats for beneficial insects and other arthropods, birds, plants etc. When appropriately designed and targeted, they also prove to be effective in controlling erosion, wind, and nutrient loss and providing landscape amenities. In this report, we focus on: i) ‘field margins’, the spontaneously established strips of herbaceous plants at the edge of fields; ii) ‘hedgerows’, composed of one or two rows of planted or naturally established shrubs and/or trees, and; iii) ‘grassy or flower strips’, intentionally sown, the former mostly with grasses and the latter with flowering plants. The central scope was to examine if and how landscape features could contribute to the profitability of arable crop production. Other direct economic effects for the farmers include the production of wood, fruits, grass for horses, etc. We also included the benefits of landscape features to the society (aesthetics, social value, ecosystem services towards society) that the markets mostly fail to provide.

40|$|Farm {{technical}} efficiency {{is a global}} productivity indicator {{in the sense that}} it considers all outputs produced and all inputs used by the farms. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) aims at promoting farm competitiveness, and hence a legitimate question is whether the CAP subsidies received by farms contribute to enhance their {{technical efficiency}}. Studies investigating the effect of subsidies on technical efficiency so far have considered only marketed outputs, that is to say, food (and fibre and feed) sold and generating revenue. Non-marketed outputs such as environmental and social outputs are not considered. Here we contribute to this issue by incorporating environmental outputs in the calculation of technical efficiency and performing the analysis of the effect of CAP subsidies on technical efficiency for more than one thousand farms across nine countries of the European Union, with Farm Accoutancy Data network (FADN) data of 2014 / 2015 and additional data collected via the FLINT project. Results indicate the effect of subsidies on farm technical efficiency changes when environmental outputs (namely greenhouse gas emissions, nitrogen balance and <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas)</b> are taken into account in the efficiency calculation. Accounting for environmental outputs may thus change policy recommandations, but it is important to account for such outputs when possible so that farms producing such outputs are not penalised in the calculation of technical efficiency...|$|R

However, despite the fact that that there has been significant emphasis placed on environment and biodiversity in policy over the years, it is generally accepted that there is still some way to go if the industry is to deliver what is expected of it in this regard. It is hoped that the introduction of <b>Ecological</b> <b>Focus</b> <b>Areas</b> (EFAs) on the farm will aid in delivering tangible environmental improvements, but this is to some extent dependent on the EFA elements a farmer selects, and their appropriateness to the local environment. Consequently, the European Commission???s Joint Research Centre (JRC) funded and coordinated a project to develop a tool which will help farmers select EFA elements that can deliver the optimal environmental benefit. The aim of this project was to develop a software application for European farmers and advisory services. The software firstly helps farmers calculate the contribution of different EFA elements to their 5 % target. Secondly, it takes into account the farms site specific characteristics and assesses the contribution of EFA elements to biodiversity and a range of ecosystem services. This will help ensure that the EFA elements selected by a farmer offer optimal benefits in terms of ecosystem services and biodiversity and are pragmatic in terms of farm management...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the new CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) of the European Union is the enhancement of environmental performance through a mandatory "greening" component of direct payments, which will support agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment. A part of the financial support that farmers receive will be linked to simple, generalized, non-contractual farming practices that go beyond cross-compliance, such as crop diversification, the maintenance of permanent grassland, and the establishment of <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas.</b> In order to better achieve {{the objectives}} of "greening" and to allow for its efficient administration and control, these practices are implemented {{depending on the size of}} the eligible area declared by the farmer and are compared to the whole area held by the applicant. The compulsory nature of those practices should also concern farmers whose lands are fully or partly situated in "Natura 2000 " areas. The implementation of the "greening" component in the Land Parcel Identification Systems (LPIS) is a challenge to be further analyzed according to their specific conditions. All spatial objects of the "greening" category should be identifiable, measurable, locatable and stable in time, which allow efficient controls. This article addresses the geospatial nature of the LPIS „greening“ component and introduces possible monitoring, measuring and control methods for the related elements and practices. In particular, it focuses on administrative checks and photointerpretation methodology based on satellite and aerial imagery. JRC. H. 4 -Monitoring Agricultural Resource...|$|R
40|$|Agri-environmental schemes (AES) in {{irrigated}} {{olive groves}} (IOG) in southern Spain were assessed based on farmers’ preferences toward these schemes. A choice experiment {{was used in}} this ex-ante assessment, with the inclusion of some innovative elements, such as collective participation and <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas</b> (EFA). The results showed that farmers’ mean willingness to accept (WTA) participation in collective rather than individual AES was € 124. 5 /ha. Their mean WTA for an additional 1 % of EFA was € 64. 6 /ha, while regarding the use of other agri-environmental practices, they showed a WTA of € 6. 3 /ha and € 114. 7 /ha for an additional 1 % in the use of cover crops (CC) in olive grove areas and restrictive management of CC, respectively. These estimates were strongly influenced by farmers’ expectations and socio-economic characteristics, as well as farm management. We obtained that farmers’ expectations of no farm takeover reduce WTA for collective participation, whereas agricultural training and having at least a secondary-school education reduce farmers’ WTA for EFA and restrictive management of the CC, respectively. Conversely, harvesting ground olives increased farmers’ WTA for a high proportion of the area under CC. The analysis of the AES scenarios showed moderately high estimates of total WTA (€ 101 - 349 /ha), especially when collective participation is required (€ 225 - 474 /ha). The results supported the argument that there are efficient ways to encourage public goods provision, overcoming trade-offs with private goods provision by identifying the type of joint production. </p...|$|R
40|$|The "greening" of the European Union's (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{is meant}} to protect and enhance {{biodiversity}} {{as well as to}} make food production more sustainable by encouraging, for example, the responsible use of natural resources. The "greening" process seems to be driven by, first of all, the policy push through various policy and regulatory measures. Farmers have to invest time and resources in maintaining permanent grasslands, practice crop diversification and manage <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas</b> for which they will receive compensation from the EU. "Greening" is also driven by the consumer or market pull generated by preferences for more sustainably produced food and sustainability initiatives along the agro-food chain. EU investments in research and development activities are required for the successful implementation of greening practices. Professionals from different disciplines are called upon to provide, in the next few years, solutions for all the new requirements in order to realize a sustainable and socially and economically healthy agricultural system. Besides this, farmers need support to implement and manage greening measures, but also to reap the benefits of their investments by networking and engaging with stakeholders higher in the agro-food chain, such as retailers and supermarkets. This is not only to assure sustainability at processing, packaging and storage, but also to increase visibility of farmers' practices to consumers through communication that may help influencing consumers' choices. These factors are currently not given the importance they need by the EU, but are crucial for a successful "greening". © 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

Although extensive literature has analyzed AES, some important issues remain understudied. This paper performs an ex-ante assessment of AES in permanent cropping, analyzing several issues that have received little attention from researchers, such as <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas</b> (EFA) and collective participation. For this purpose, a choice experiment was used to assess farmers’ preferences toward AES in a case study of olive groves in southern Spain. Results show high heterogeneity among farmers, with different classes being identified, from potential participants to non-participants. As regards EFA, almost half of the farmers would be willing to accept it for low monetary incentives (€ 8 - 9 /ha per additional 1 % of the farmland devoted to EFA) while the rest would do it for moderate-to-high monetary incentives (€ 41 - 151 /ha per additional 1 % of EFA). However, for a high share of EFA (e. g., 5 - 7 %) higher incentives would presumably be required due to the intrinsic spatial restrictions of olive groves. With regard to collective participation, we find that it is unlikely that farmers would participate collectively with the incentive of the up-to- 30 % EU-wide bonus. These results are relevant for policy-making now when new AES are being designed for the next programming period 2014 - 2020.

40|$|The EFA {{software}} is a prototype tool {{that has been}} designed to perform two key functions: (1) provide a facility to describe and declare features on the farm as <b>Ecological</b> <b>Focus</b> <b>Areas</b> (EFAs); and (2) Assess the impact of features on the farm with respect their potential effects on ecosystem services, biodiversity and farm management. The first function allows users to enter data about features (in the Land and Feature Manager), such as dimensions, and then an EFA assessment will allow user to declare these features as EFAs. This EFA assessment will check the rules and determine if the features selected are eligible to be EFA. If the features are eligible, then the EFA assessment will track progress towards the 5 % EFA target and, if the target has not been met, make suggestions on what could be implemented on the farm to reach the 5 % target. The second function provides users with feedback on the potential impact of the features on the farm on ecosystem services, biodiversity and farm management. These are just suggestions on potential impacts, as such they are not quantified with numbers. Instead indicator bars and icons are used as a means to communicate potential impacts. This impact data can also be used when considering what new features to implement, e. g. in the event that the 5 % EFA target is not met with existing features. A ranking tool with the software allows users to rank features based on their potential impact for a range of criteria (these can be the top level criteria of ecosystem services, biodiversity and management or they can be bespoke/specific impacts selected by the user). In so doing, this helps steer users towards implementing features that will increase the potential positive impact of the farm on ecosystem services, biodiversity and management...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractSustainable {{development}} of agriculture {{is at the}} core of agricultural policy debates in Europe. There is a consensus that diversification of cropping would support sustainable development. However, a reduction in legume cultivation has been observed in the EU during the last decades. This decline has induced, in turn, a deficit of proteins and a reduction of ecosystem services provided by legumes. Therefore, we analysed the mechanisms that shape agricultural systems to identify leverage points for reviving European legume production. Specifically, we reviewed the factors that affect the market and non-market value of legumes and the relevant agricultural policies. We characterized the decline in legume cropping as an outcome of the dominance of economic forces that favour specialization of production systems over diversification. We found that the value of market outputs of legumes per unit area is relatively low and volatile, with a 25 – 78  % variation in pea gross margins, which reduces market competitiveness. We observed that the value of system-internal outputs of legumes such as the nitrogen fixed, of 130 to 153  kg N ha− 1; crop protection services that reduce agrochemical costs, by 20 – 25  % in cereals; and yield enhancements of subsequent crops, of 0. 2 to 1. 6  t ha− 1 in cereals, are often underestimated. In addition, markets fail to translate external effects of legumes such as biodiversity enhancement, reduction in emissions, of up to 50  % in N 2 O, and soil improvements into economic benefits. Current policies support legumes through selected mechanisms such as <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas,</b> agri-environmental programmes and sparse coupled support measures. Domestic cultivation of legumes could be supported through trade policies such as import restrictions on genetically modified soybean or new mechanisms to appreciate non-market outputs including payments for ecosystem services and carbon markets.

40|$|Meeting the world's growing {{energy demand}} through {{bioenergy}} production involves extensive land-use change {{which could have}} severe environmental and social impacts. Second generation bioenergy feedstocks offer a possible solution to this problem. They {{have the potential to}} reduce land-use conflicts between food and bioenergy production as they can be grown on low quality land not suitable for food production. However, a comprehensive impact assessment that considers multiple ecosystem services (ESS) and biodiversity is needed to identify the environmentally best feedstock option, as trade-offs are inherent. In this study, we simulate the spatial distribution of short rotation coppices (SRCs) in the landscape of the Mulde watershed in Central Germany by modeling profit-maximizing farmers under different economic and policy-driven scenarios using a spatially explicit economic simulation model. This allows to derive general insights and a mechanistic understanding of regional-scale impacts on multiple ESS in the absence of large-scale implementation. The modeled distribution of SRCs, required to meet the regional demand of combined heat and power (CHP) plants for solid biomass, had little or no effect on the provided ESS. In the policy-driven scenario, placing SRCs on low or high quality soils to provide <b>ecological</b> <b>focus</b> <b>areas,</b> as required within the Common Agricultural Policy in the EU, had little effect on ESS. Only a substantial increase in the SRC production area, beyond the regional demand of CHP plants, had a relevant effect, namely a negative impact on food production as well as a positive impact on biodiversity and regulating ESS. Beneficial impacts occurred for single ESS. However, the number of sites with balanced ESS supply hardly increased due to larger shares of SRCs in the landscape. Regression analyses showed that the occurrence of sites with balanced ESS supply was more strongly driven by biophysical factors than by the SRC share in the landscape. This indicates that SRCs negligibly affect trade-offs between individual ESS. Coupling spatially explicit economic simulation models with environmental and ESS assessment models can contribute to a comprehensive impact assessment of bioenergy feedstocks that have not yet been planted...|$|R
