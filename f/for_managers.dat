5|$|After taking office, Booker voluntarily reduced his own salary twice, {{reducing}} {{his salary}} by 8% {{early in his}} first year as mayor. He also raised the salaries of many city workers. However, his administration imposed one-day-a-month furloughs for all non-uniformed employees from July through December 2010, as well as 2% pay cuts <b>for</b> <b>managers</b> and directors earning more than $100,000 a year. In 2008 and 2009 the City of Newark received the Government Finance Officers Association's Distinguished Budget Presentation Award. In an effort to make government more accessible, Booker held regular open office hours during which city residents can meet with him personally to discuss their concerns. In 2010, Booker was among the finalists for the World Mayor prize, ultimately placing seventh. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the 2012 award.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} move, Rowe formed {{a new group}} under Herbert Skinner to develop the {{magnetron}} into an AI system, at that time known as AI, Sentimetric (AIS). Lovell adapted his parabolic antennas to the magnetron with relative ease, and the AIS team immediately detected a passing aircraft when they turned on the set {{for the first time}} on 12 August 1940. The next day they were asked to demonstrate the set <b>for</b> <b>managers,</b> but no airplane happened to be flying by. Instead, they had one of the workers bicycle along a nearby cliff carrying a small plate of aluminum sheet. This neatly demonstrated its ability to detect objects very close to the ground. As AIS rapidly developed into the AI Mk. VII, development of the Mk. IV's follow-ons, the Mk. V, and Mk. VI (see below) saw vacillating support.|$|E
5|$|The Veterans Committee {{election}} process was revised in July 2007. With the 2007 rules changes, the composite ballot was {{split into two}} separate ballots—one <b>for</b> <b>managers</b> and umpires {{and the other for}} executives. Also, the voting membership of the Committee, which previously included all living members of the Hall, was reduced to include just a handful of those members, plus additional executives and sportswriters. Voting for both the managers/umpires and executives ballots, which now takes place prior to inductions in even-numbered years, began with the 2008 class of inductees, when two managers and three executives were elected. To be eligible, managers and umpires must be retired for at least five years, or for at least six months if they are age 65 or older, while executives must be either retired or at least age 65.|$|E

25|$|Although it was {{admitted}} {{that those who}} were mere investors {{ought not to be}} liable for debts arising from the management of a corporation, throughout the late nineteenth century there were still many arguments for unlimited liability <b>for</b> <b>managers</b> and directors on the model of the French société en commandite. Such liability for directors of English companies was abolished in 2006. Further, it became increasingly common {{from the end of the}} nineteenth century for shareholders to be directors, protecting themselves from liability.|$|E
25|$|Blue crab populations {{naturally}} fluctuate {{with annual}} changes in environmental conditions. They {{have been described}} as having a long-term dynamic equilibrium, which was first noted after irregular landings data in the Chesapeake in 1950. This tendency may have made it difficult <b>for</b> <b>managers</b> to predict the severe decline of the Chesapeake’s blue crab populations. Once considered an overwhelmingly abundant annoyance, the declining blue crab population is now the subject of anxiety among fishermen and managers. Over the decade between the mid-1990s to 2004, the population fell from 900 million to around 300 million, and harvest weight fell from 52,000 tons (115,000,000 lbs) to 28,000 tons (62,000,000 lbs). Revenue fell further, from $72 million to $61 million. Long term estimates say that the overall Chesapeake population decreased approximately 70% in the last few decades. Even more alarming, the number of females capable of reproducing, known as spawning age females, has plummeted 84% in just a few decades. Survival and addition of juveniles to the harvestable crab population is also low. Many factors are to blame for low blue crab numbers, including high fishing pressure, environmental degradation, and disease prevalence.|$|E
25|$|Bureaucratic {{structures}} {{have many}} levels of management ranging from senior executives to regional managers, {{all the way}} to department store managers. Since there are many levels, decision-making authority has to pass through more layers than flatter organizations. A bureaucratic organization has rigid and tight procedures, policies and constraints. This kind of structure is reluctant to adapt or change what they have been doing since the company started. Organizational charts exist for every department, and everyone understands who is in charge and what their responsibilities are for every situation. Decisions are made through an organized process, and a strict command and control structure is present at all times.In bureaucratic structures, the authority is at the top and information is then flowed from top to bottom. This causes for more rules and standards for the company which operational process is watched with close supervision. Some advantages for bureaucratic structures for top-level managers are they have a tremendous control over organizational structure decisions. This works best <b>for</b> <b>managers</b> who have a command and control style of managing. Strategic decision-making is also faster because there are fewer people it has to go through to approve. Some disadvantages in bureaucratic structures are it can discourage creativity and innovation in the organization. This can make it hard for a company to adapt to changing conditions in the marketplace.|$|E

500|$|Like Khrushchev, Kosygin {{tried to}} reform the command economy within a socialist framework. In 1965 Kosygin {{initiated}} an economic reform widely {{referred to as the}} [...] "Kosygin reform". Kosygin sought to make Soviet industry more efficient by including some market measures common in the First World such as profit making for instance; he also tried to increase quantity of production, increase incentives <b>for</b> <b>managers</b> and workers, and freeing managers from centralised state bureaucracy. The reform had been proposed to Khrushchev in 1964, who evidently liked it and took some preliminary steps to implement it. Brezhnev allowed the reform to proceed because the Soviet economy was entering a period of low growth. In its testing phase, the reform was applied to 336 enterprises in light industry.|$|E
500|$|During the Roman {{occupation}} of Britain (AD 43–409), the settlement was [...] "extensive and of considerable importance." [...] Its location along the fen-edge {{may have made}} it economically and administratively significant as a centre <b>for</b> <b>managers</b> and owners of fenland estates. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} a road connected Old Sleaford to Heckington (about [...] east), where Roman tile kilns have been uncovered and may imply the presence of a market at Sleaford. When the first roads were constructed by the Romans, Sleaford was bypassed due to it being [...] "less conveniently located" [...] and more [...] "geared to native needs". A smaller road, Mareham Lane, which the Romans renewed, ran through Old Sleaford, and southwards along the fen edge, towards Bourne. Where it passed through Old Sleaford, excavations have revealed a large stone-built domestic residence, associated farm buildings, corn-driers, ovens and field systems, all from the Roman period, and a number of burials. Other Roman remains, including a burial, have been excavated in the town.|$|E
