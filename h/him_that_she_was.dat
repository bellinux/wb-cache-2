Sixteen-year-old Sharon met twenty-two-year-old college student James Kinne at a church function in the summer of 1956, and the couple dated regularly until Kinne returned to Brigham Young University in the fall. Sharon, reportedly deeply interested in finding a partner with prospects and who could take her away from Independence, soon wrote a letter to Kinne at school informing <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> pregnant by him. Kinne took leave from his college and returned to Independence, where he married Sharon on October 18, 1956.
