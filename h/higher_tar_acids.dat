This is why the focus in this master thesis study {{was to create a}} catalyst for secondary tar steam reforming. The aim was to create a catalyst that was suitable for tar steam reforming and also evaluate the effect that alkali had on the catalyst. A catalyst composed of 20 %Bronzes –ZrO 2 impregnated with nickel was prepared in this study and characterised with XRD and BET. The bronzes consisted of K 0. 25 WO 3 and was prepared with two different methods and analysed with XRD {{to see if there was}} some difference in the structure and purity. Three different weight loads of nickel: 5 -, 10 - and 15 wt%, was prepared for each catalyst that was named Method 1 and Method 2. In total six catalysts was tested in an experimental test rig that was situated at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. In addition a blank test was performed for comparison of the catalytic activity. For the experiments 1 -methylnaphthalene was decided to be used as a simulated tar. The experiments were divided into two parts where in Part 1 a S/C ratio of 4 was used and Part 2 a S/C ratio of 6 was used. The experiments were conducted at reactor temperatures of 700 °C and 800 °C with or without alkali aerosols. Other parameters changed in the experiments were the catalyst load, 1 -methylnaphthalene flow and the gas hourly space velocity. Results were analysed with 4 micro gas chromatographs and solid phase adsorption. Results from the catalyst characterisation indicated that the wanted catalyst had been prepared however in Method 2 a higher purity of the bronzes was reached compared to Method 1. The results from the BET analysis gave a surface area of between 40 - 46 m 2 /g for the different catalysts. In the experiments from Part 1 a very high gas hourly space velocity was used and the results indicated that there was almost tar reduction compared to the blank test. In Part 2 the gas hourly space velocity was lowered and a <b>higher</b> <b>tar</b> reduction and was obtained. One test was also conducted at 900 °C where the <b>highest</b> <b>tar</b> reduction was obtained, almost 40 %. From the results it could be seen tar reduction and 1 -MN/naphthalene ratio was increasing with higher temperatures and nickel loadings. Catalysts prepared from Method 2 also showed a <b>higher</b> <b>tar</b> reduction and 1 -MN/naphthalene ratio compared to Method 1 which could indicate that it was more stable and had a higher purity of the bronzes. The results from atomic absorption spectrophotometer showed that the mass of potassium in the catalyst before the experiment decreased between 3 - 29 % compared to after the experiment. From the rather low decrease in potassium the hexagonal structure of the bronzes clearly protects the potassium from evaporating within the bulk.

For biomass gasification, the <b>high</b> <b>tar</b> {{and carbon}} {{monoxide}} contents {{and the low}} heat value of fuel gas are problems to be solved, which leading to the poor operating conditions of the completed projects in China. Therefore, a new technology of biomass oxygen-enriched gasification in pressurized fluidized bed is proposed. Coupling the technologies of pressurized biomass oxygen-enriched gasification at low temperature, high-temperature gasification and melting, steam reforming and hydrocarbon synthesis, the <b>high</b> gasification efficiency, <b>tar</b> cracking and gas reforming shall be realized, and the middle/high heat value gas which meets the national standards will be produced. ASPEN PLUS simulation was carried out for biomass oxygen-enriched gasification. Both the equivalent ratio and gas yield of rice husk are {{lower than that of}} the wood sawdust, while the gas calorific values are equivalent. Considering the gas yield, the calorific value and economy, the optimum operating conditions are obtained: the gasification temperature at 1200 ˚C, the oxygen purity at 0. 9, the equivalent ratio at about 0. 25, the S/B ratio at 0. 1 ~ 0. 2. The gas yield could reach 1. 9 m 3 /kg, and the gas calorific value was above 11 MJ/m 3...|$|R
