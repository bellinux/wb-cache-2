5|$|After Flower was {{released}} to critical praise and awards, Chen and Thatgamecompany {{moved on to}} their next game, Journey. Journey was intended by Chen {{to focus on the}} element of communication and social interaction in video games. Since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals, in Journey Chen intended for the player to be able to either play alone or to come across other players, but not be able to communicate with them directly. Instead, players have to build relationships with each other through their actions, <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> other or leaving as they choose. Journey {{was released}} on the PlayStation Network on March 13, 2012, and has received critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} May 16, 1988, in the Tabernas Desert in Spain's Almería province. Spielberg originally had planned the chase to {{be a short}} sequence shot over two days, but he drew up storyboards to make the scene an action-packed centerpiece. Thinking he would not surpass the truck chase from Raiders of the Lost Ark (because the truck was much faster than the tank), he felt this sequence should be more story-based and needed to show Indiana and Henry <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> other. He later said he had more fun storyboarding the sequence than filming it. The second unit had begun filming two weeks before. After approximately ten days, the production moved to Bellas Artes to film the scenes set in the Sultan of Hatay's palace. Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park {{was used for the}} road, tunnel and beach sequence in which birds strike the plane. The Spanish portion of location filming finished on June 2, 1988, in Guadix, Granada, with filming of Brody's capture at İskenderun train station. The filmmakers built a mosque near the station for atmosphere, rather than adding it as a visual effect.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{introduces}} Mick St. John, {{a private}} investigator {{who has been a}} vampire for over fifty years. Mick meets Beth Turner, a reporter for the online newspaper BuzzWire, {{at the scene of the}} murder of a young woman. Mick and Beth begin investigating the crime together, <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> other to catch the killer. Flashbacks to 22 years ago show a domestic fight between Mick and his ex-wife Coraline Duvall over a kidnapped girl. Mick lights the house on fire and rescues the girl, leaving Coraline to the fire. It is revealed that the little girl has grown up to be Beth, and that Mick has tried to watch over her and keep her safe over the years. In the present, Beth discovers that Mick is a vampire, and Mick reveals how one becomes a vampire and tells her the story of how he was turned by his bride, Coraline, on their wedding night.|$|E

25|$|The Destiny of Nations was {{composed}} by Samuel Taylor Coleridge {{as part of}} Robert Southey's Joan of Arc epic poem. The lines were later isolated from Southey's and expanded.

25|$|FIRST {{seeks to}} promote a {{philosophy}} of teamwork and collaboration among engineers and encourages competing teams to remain friendly, <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> other out when necessary. Terms frequently applied to this ethos are Gracious Professionalism and Coopertition; terms coined by Woodie Flowers and Kamen that support respect towards one's competitors and integrity in one's actions. The concept of Gracious Professionalism grew from a robotics class that Flowers taught at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Coopertition is patented under US Patent 7,507,169 by Dean Kamen.|$|E
25|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Chris Robinson. It premiered on VH1 on March 5, 2012. The video {{was inspired by the}} films Thelma & Louise (1991) and Waiting to Exhale (1995), and portrays the singers in dysfunctional relationships and <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> other in both situations. Monica and Brandy promoted the song doing several performances, radio and television interviews. The singers were also going to perform the track on the Clive Davis' Pre-Grammy Party in 2012; however, the performance was cancelled following Whitney Houston's passing.|$|E
25|$|Eukaryotic {{transcriptional}} activators {{have separate}} DNA-binding and activating functions. Upon binding to its cis-element, an activator can recruit polymerase directly or recruit other factors {{needed by the}} transcriptional machinery. An activator can also recruit nucleosome modifiers that alter chromatin {{in the vicinity of}} the promoter and thereby help initiation. Multiple activators can work together, either by recruiting a common or two mutually dependent components of the transcriptional machinery, or by <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> other bind to their DNA sites. These interactions can synergize multiple signaling inputs and produce intricate transcriptional responses to address cellular needs.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{societies}} share {{a common}} value of people <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> other; not only do volunteer acts assist others, but they also benefit the volunteering individual on a personal level. Despite having similar objectives, tension can arise between volunteers and state-provided services. In order to curtail this tension, most countries develop policies and enact legislation to clarify the roles and relationships among governmental stakeholders and their voluntary counterparts; this regulation identifies and allocates the necessary legal, social, administrative, and financial support of each party. This is particularly necessary when some voluntary activities {{are seen as a}} challenge to the authority of the state(e.g., on 29 January 2001, President Bush cautioned that volunteer groups should supplement—not replace—government agencies’ work).|$|E
25|$|Outside of cricket, Vaughan {{worked for}} Shell in Ceylon {{during the early}} 1930s. Returning from Ceylon, he took up farming in 1935, buying Middle Farm in Winterbourne Monkton, Wiltshire. He married to Blanche Innes Dickson in 1937, with the couple having 3 children, with their {{daughter}} Sarah Merion Vaughan being bestowed an OBE during her life. He served in World War II with the Royal Army Service Corps, obtaining the rank of 2nd Lieutenant in 1940. He was later promoted to a full Lieutenant and later in March 1941 to a Temporary Captain. The Service Corp was later attached to the 18th Infantry Division, arriving in Singapore just 3 weeks before the Japanese invasion, which ended in a British surrender. He spent time following the surrender as a POW in the Changi Prison, before being sent {{to work on the}} Burma Railway, working there for 8 months. During his internment he came across his brother-in-law, John Austin Dickson, with the two of them <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> other through their captivity. His experiences during the war were rarely mentioned by him in later life.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{no longer}} {{formally}} operating as a team, Ambrose and Reigns continued to infrequently {{work together and}} maintained an on-screen friendship following The Shield's split. On the January 9, 2015 episode of SmackDown, Reigns {{was about to be}} put into a handicap match against Rollins and Big Show until Ambrose came to the aid of Reigns and helped defeat them, with the two continuously <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> other against The Authority thereafter. On the May 4 episode of Raw, Ambrose defeated Rollins and (as per pre-stipulation by the Director of Operations Kane) gained his first opportunity for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, being added to the title match at Payback and making it a fatal four-way match, also including Reigns and Randy Orton, with the latter being pinned by Rollins. During the match, Ambrose, Reigns and Rollins briefly worked together to perform their signature triple powerbomb on Orton. Ambrose later faced Rollins at Elimination Chamber on May 31, which saw Reigns' involvement after multiple interference by The Authority on Rollins' behalf to help Ambrose, who won by disqualification after Rollins pushed the referee in Ambrose's way as he tried to catch the standing Rollins with his signature diving elbow drop. Despite the win, Ambrose did not gain the championship, but he still took the championship belt with him and challenged Rollins in a ladder match at Money in the Bank on June 14, which he would go on to lose.|$|E

500|$|In addition, unlike {{preceding}} traditional Disney animated feature films, {{the developing}} romantic relationship between Mulan and Li Shang {{is treated as}} more of a subplot as opposed to a traditional central plot, as observed by film critic Andy Klein of Animation World Network. Klein commented, [...] "Mulan isn't waiting for her prince to someday come; when he does arrive, having known her primarily as a man, and having learned to admire her for her deeper qualities, the romance is muted and subtle." [...] Throughout the movie they are constantly working towards <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> other change into better and truer versions of themselves in order to achieve their true potential.|$|E

[...] Even so, the three comedians [...] "shared a certain comedic sensibility", and admitted that they had a good time while <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> other out.

500|$|To {{accommodate}} {{increasing interest}} for the club following good results during the early 1970s, the board approved a new grandstand on the east long side.

The club house was expanded to [...] In 1974, the club won promotion to the First Division, and the new grandstand was extended by 352 seats. On the west side, two wooden and steel standing terraces were built. The expansion was done with help of volunteer work, with 30 to 40 people <b>helping</b> <b>each</b> weekday evening and up to 80 people helping at the weekends.|$|E
