40|$|AbstractCyclic ribodiguanylic acid, c-(GpGp), is the {{endogenous}} effector regulator {{of cellulose}} synthase. Its three-dimensional structure {{from two different}} crystal forms (tetragonal and trigonal) has been determined by X-ray diffraction analysis at 1 Å resolution. In both crystal forms, two independent c-(GpGp) molecules associate {{with each other to}} form a self-intercalated dimer. A hydrated cobalt ion is found to coordinate to two N 7 atoms of adjacent guanines, forcing these two guanines to <b>destack</b> with a large dihedral angle (32 °), in the dimer of the tetragonal form. This metal coordination mechanism may be relevant to that of the anticancer drug cisplatin. Moreover, c-(GpGp) exhibits unusual spectral properties not seen in any other cyclic dinucleotide. It interacts with planar organic intercalator molecules in ways similar to double helical DNA. We propose a cage-like model consisting of a tetrameric c-(GpGp) aggregate in which a large cavity (‘host’) is generated to afford a binding site for certain planar intercalators (‘guests’) ...|$|E
40|$|A sample {{stacking}} {{procedure to}} which a specific combination of electrolyte solutions is applied is isotachophoresis (ITP) superimposed on capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), a so-called ITP/CZE system. In ITP/CZE some components migrate in an ITP fashion {{on top of a}} background electrolyte, and the other analytes migrate in a zone electrophoretic manner. For such a system, the leading electrolyte consists of a mixture of an ionic species, L 1, of high mobility (the leading ion of the ITP system), an ionic species, L 2, of low mobility (the coions of the CZE system), and a buffering counterionic species, whereas the terminating solution only contains the ionic species L 2 and the buffering counterions. The zones of the components migrating in the ITP/CZE mode are sharp owing to the self-correcting properties of the zones and the concentrations of the L 1 ions of the system. Mobility windows can be calculated, indicating which ions can migrate in the ITP/CZE mode. In this article mobility windows are calculated by applying both strong and weak acids as L 1 and L 2 ions and it appears that mobility windows can be optimized by chosing different ratios of L 1 and L 2 as well as different pH values. It is possible to construct very narrow mobility windows, and thereby choose which component of a sample solution can be concentrated, and to what concentration, in a very selective way. The big advantage of ITP/CZE compared with applications such as transient ITP and transient stacking is that the stacked sample ionic species migrate in the ITP mode during the whole experiment; furthermore, they do not <b>destack.</b> Experimentally obtained electropherograms validate the calculated mobility windows for the ITP/CZE mode...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} my {{research}} {{is the development of}} technology for building compound biological systems from simpler pieces. I designed BioScaffold parts, a family of variable regions that can be inserted into a DNA sequence so that at a later time another set of pieces can be substituted for each variable. The variable regions are selective so that a particular piece can be targeted to each region. I have used this technique to assemble protein domains, tune the expression levels of proteins and remove BioBrick scars. BioScaffold parts can be used in combination with BioBrick Standard Biological Parts to create and store devices with tunable components. I developed simplified methods to produce and examine SbpA, a protein that can either self associate into two-dimensional crystals or bring together fused enzymes when divalent cations such as calcium are added to the protein monomers. My fast and easy purification protocol allows SbpA to be produced under non-denaturing conditions as well as examination of the native state of the protein monomers before crystallization. The absence of a white precipitate when calcium is added to SbpA monomers concentrated to 1 mg/ml provides a simple visual screen that indicates that the protein has failed to crystallize. I also developed a protocol to embed SbpA crystallized on lipid monolayers in trehalose for electron microscopy, allowing creation of a 7 Å resolution map for SbpA. I created a cells-on-paper system to compose, isolate, and subsequently <b>destack</b> and examine different cell types grown in sheets of ordinary filter paper and maintained in a humidified incubation chamber. I found that E coli diluted in LB broth and then applied to filter paper grew at rates similar to the same culture spotted on agar plates. Track etch membranes could be used to isolate different cell types, while still allowing chemical communication between the layers. Use of plasmids that contain fluorescent proteins allowed the behaviour of cells to be tracked using a scanner after destacking of the layers. The cells-on-paper system can be used both to test and construct modular synthetic systems composed of bacterial ensembles and to create and examine the behavior of compositions of cell types typically found in biofilms. by Julie Erin Norville.

This spin-labelled analogue of an endogenous thylakoid lipid has previously been shown to exhibit a selectivity of interaction with thylakoid proteins. Neither <b>destacking,</b> phosphorylation nor illumination was found to change the ESR spectra appreciably, suggesting that for phosphatidylglycerol at least, neither the number of protein-associated membrane lipids nor their pattern of selectivity was altered.

40|$|Part I: The Use of Deuterated Phospholipids to Elucidate Lipid-Lipid Interactions in Bilayer Vesicles. The {{motional}} {{state of}} lecithin molecules in single walled bilayer vesicles {{has been studied}} by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Inter- and intramolecular relaxation rates have been determined for the hydrocarbon chain methylene protons. The intermolecular contribution is much smaller than previously estimated. The data suggest a model in which hydrocarbon chain motion is described by rapid kink formation and diffusion along the chains in addition to slower C-C trans-gauche rotations. A lateral diffusion coefficient of 2. 5 - 5. 5 x 10 ^(- 8) cm^ 2 sec^(- 1) is estimated. Both linewidths and spin-lattice relaxation rates have been measured for lecithins with different hydrocarbon chain lengths. Above the crystal to liquid crystal phase transition temperature, the linewidths are independent of chain length. This is taken {{to indicate that the}} hydrocarbon chain mobility and order are also independent of chain length. The motional state of cholesterol in bilayer vesicles has been studied. Cholesterol dispersed in bilayers consisting of dipalmitoyl lecithin with perdeuterated hydrocarbon chains has an NMR spectrum with well defined features. Two of the five methyl resonances are sharp and clearly resolved. These are assigned to the isopropyl methyls of the hydrocarbon tail. The other methyl resonances are much broader. This is taken to indicate that the hydrocarbon tail is much more mobile and disordered than the steroid nucleus. These conclusions are in agreement with and provide experimental support for the model proposed by Rothman and Engelman, but contrast with recent NMR studies which conclude that both the steroid nucleus and hydrocarbon tail are highly immobilized. Part II: The Effect of Chain Length on the Secondary Structure of Oligoadenylates. The oligoadenylates (Ap) _(2 _ 4) A have been studied by proton magnetic resonance (pmr) spectroscopy. All the exterior base protons and a number of the interior base proton resonances have been assigned. The results of this work showed that the adenine bases in these oligoadenylates are intramolecularly stacked at 20 °C with their bases oriented preferentially in the anti conformation about their respective glycosidic bonds. The oligomers were found to associate extensively even at concentrations of 0. 02 M, primarily via "end to end" stacking. With increasing temperature the oligomer bases <b>destack,</b> but it is argued that this unfolding process cannot be described in terms of a two-state stacked versus unstacked model. Instead, the temperature dependences of the base proton chemical shifts support a base-oscillation model. The relationship between this model and the "two-state" model is discussed. Finally, {{on the basis of the}} chain-length dependence of the proton chemical shifts of the various adenine bases, it was concluded that subtle variations in the secondary structure of these oligomers exist with increasing chain length. Evidence is presented to show that the effects of distant base shielding are considerably smaller than what was previously estimated. The observed departures from the "extended dimer" model are attributed to differences in the relative orientations of the bases with respect to their neighbors in the oligomer...|$|E

A normal morphology of the membranes in which stacked grana can be observed is preserved up to 35 °C.

Heating above 45 °C causes phase-separation of non-bilayer lipids into aggregates of cylindrical inverted micelles.

Hydrothermal synthesis of MoS 2 in an autoclave was also found to result in <b>destacking,</b> and in that study, the presence of hydrocarbons was presented as a possible contributor (Peng et al. 2001) while, in a separate study, Chianelli et al. note that possible intercalation of H 2 at high pressures could result in MoS 2 layers simply sliding apart over time (Chianelli et al. 2006).

40|$|With the aim to {{specifically}} study the molecular mechanisms behind photoinhibition of photosystem I, stacked spinach (Spinacia oleracea) thylakoids were irradiated at 4 °C with far-red light (> 715 nm) exciting photosystem I, but not photosystem II. Selective excitation of photosystem I by far-red light for 130 min {{resulted in a}} 40 % inactivation of photosystem I. It is surprising that this treatment also caused up to 90 % damage to photosystem II. This suggests that active oxygen produced at the reducing side of photosystem I is highly damaging to photosystem II. Only a small pool of the D 1 -protein was degraded. However, most of the D 1 -protein was modified to a slightly higher molecular mass, indicative of a damage-induced conformational change. The far-red illumination was also performed using <b>destacked</b> and randomized thylakoids in which {{the distance between the}} photosystems is shorter. Upon 130 min of illumination, photosystem I showed an approximate 40 % inactivation as in stacked thylakoids.

In accordance with this, photosystem II, but not photosystem I is more protected from photoinhibition in <b>destacked</b> thylakoids.

Furthermore, the spin densities of both of these radicals can be manipulated using water and pH. In the case of the semiquinone radical, the comproportionation reaction governs the pH- and hydration-dependent behavior. In contrast, the mechanism underlying the carbon-centered radical’s pH- and hydration-dependent behavior is not clear; consequently, we have proposed a new <b>destacking</b> model in which the intermolecular structure of melanin is disordered due to π–π <b>destacking,</b> brought about by the addition of water or increased pH, which increases the proportion of semiquinone radicals via the comproportionation reaction...|$|R

40|$|Sweeping under inhomogeneous {{electric}} field conditions {{has been described}} as a process that includes stacking or <b>destacking</b> of the micelles when entering the sample zone, sweeping of analytes by the stacked or <b>destacked</b> micelles, and <b>destacking</b> or stacking of the swept analyte zone. However, there is ongoing debate that not only the retention factor of the analyte but also the electric conductivity of the sample solution or the concentration of an added salt can have an impact on the enrichment efficiency. Revisiting the equations describing sweeping, a factor θ (phase ratio shift factor) is defined to quantitatively describe the change of the retention factor between the sample and separation zones. The influence of the sample matrix composition on the experimentally obtained sweeping efficiency is studied with SDS as pseudostationary phase taking parabens, benzamide and anilines as model analytes. To this end, a robust and reliable method for the assessment of the sweeping efficiency is developed. The values obtained via this method are very precise and agree well with theoretically predicted ones. The results obtained for varied buffer concentration and varied concentration of NaCl in the sample solution show that under the conditions of our experimental study, the approximation of assuming θ to be equal to the reciprocal value of the field strength enhancement factor γ is valid. Accordingly, the sweeping efficiency for neutral analytes is independent of the electric conductivity of the sample matrix. It is also shown that under specific conditions unexpectedly high enrichment factors are obtained which are ascribed to the focusing of neutral analytes by micellar transient isotachophoresis (mtITP). The results obtained in this study can be used as a guide for better understanding of the sweeping process and the factors affecting the sweeping efficiency in micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) ...|$|R

Systems for 3 D cultures exist but do not replicate the spatial distributions of oxygen, metabolites, and signaling molecules found in tissues. Microfabrication can create architecturally complex scaffolds for 3 D cell cultures that circumvent some of these limitations; unfortunately, these approaches require instrumentation not commonly available in biology laboratories. Here we report that stacking and <b>destacking</b> layers of paper impregnated with suspensions of cells in extracellular matrix hydrogel makes it possible to control oxygen and nutrient gradients in 3 D and to analyze molecular and genetic responses.

A control analysis reveals an unexpected flux control of the whole chain electron transport by photosystem (PS) II. The contribution of PSII to the flux control of whole chain electron transport was high in stacked thylakoids (control coefficient, CJ(PSII) = 0. 85), but decreased after <b>destacking</b> (CJ(PSII) = 0. 25). From an ‘electron storage’ experiment, we conclude that in stacked thylakoids only about 50 to 60 % of photoreducable PQ is involved in the light-saturated linear electron transport. No redox equilibration throughout the membrane between fixed redox groups at PSII and cytochrome (cyt) bf complexes, and the diffusable carrier PQ is achieved. The data support the PQ diffusion microdomain concept by Lavergne et al. [J. Lavergne, J. -P. Bouchaud, P. Joliot, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1101 (1992) 13 – 22], but we come to different conclusions about size, structure and size distribution of domains. From an analysis of cyt b 6 reduction, as a function of PSII inhibition, we conclude that in stacked thylakoids about 70 % of PSII is located in small domains, where only 1 to 2 PSII share a local pool of a few PQ molecules. Thirty percent of PSII is located in larger domains. No small domains were found in <b>destacked</b> thylakoids. We present a structural model assuming a hierarchy of specific, strong and weak interactions between PSII core, light harvesting complexes (LHC) II and cyt bf. Peripheral LHCII’s may serve to connect PSII–LHCII supercomplexes to a flexible protein network, by which small closed lipid diffusion compartments are formed. Within each domain, PQ moves rapidly and shuttles electrons between PSII and cyt bf complexes in the close vicinity. At the same time, long range diffusion is slow.

40|$|In {{the current}} study, a new {{approach}} to the synthesis of highly <b>destacked</b> ReS 2 layers embedded in amorphous carbon via the thermal decomposition of a tetraoctylammonium perrhenate precursor, under sulfidizing atmosphere (15 % v/v H 2 S mixture H 2 S/H- 2 gas), is described. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the thermolysis product confirm the formation of rhenium disulfide. The synthesized compound is found as single layers with a minor proportion of few-layer arrangements, embedded in amorphous carbon.

40|$|Non-detergent {{procedure}} for isolation of sub-thylakoid vesicle populations derived from different structural domains of the chloroplast thylakoid membrane has been developed. Sub-thylakoid vesicles representing the grana, grana core, stroma lamellae and the grana margins have been isolated and their protein composition has been investigated. Furthermore a novel non-detergent {{procedure for}} investigating the pigment composition of photosynthetic complexes {{located in the}} different structural domains has been developed. This procedure circumvents selective extractions and pertubing effects often combined with detergent isolations of membrane bound protein complexes. The fractionation experiments show that the NADPH dehydrogenase, suggested to be operating as NADPH or ferredoxin-plastoquinone oxidoreductase in cyclic electron transport around photosystem I, is stoichiometrically depleated on photosystem I basis in the grana domain. The fractionation studies {{are consistent with the}} model of the thylakoid membrane where the photosystems in the grana are operating in a linear electron transport whereas the site of cyclic electron transport is in the stroma lamellae. It is suggested that partial <b>destacking</b> of grana, as a result of light induced protein phosphorylation, may promote the exposure of the granal photosystem I centers to the chloroplast stroma and thereby enhance their participation in cyclic electron transport activity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA ribooligonucleotide microhelix {{derived from}} the {{acceptor}} stem of Escherichia coli tRNAAla having a C 3 -A 70 mismatch {{in place of the}} G 3 -U 70 wobble pair in the wild-type tRNAAla, and a sequence variant with a regular U 3 -A 70 base pair have been investigated by NMR. In vivo, suppressor tRNAAla variants with C 3 -A 70 (as well as several other) mismatch pairs are substrates for alanyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS), supporting the hypothesis of an `indirect' recognition of the identity element 3 - 70 mismatch pair via structural modifications caused by the mispair in comparison to canonical A-RNA helices. It is demonstrated that the C-A mismatch likewise induces helix geometry alterations, in particular with respect to base stacking {{in the vicinity of the}} mismatch. However, with reference to the `wild-type' G 3 -U 70 microhelix, <b>destacking</b> in the C 3 -A 70 acceptor stem duplex occurs in the opposite direction from the mismatch pair. Therefore it is concluded that the locally enhanced conformational flexibility or dynamics associated with the structural changes induced by the mismatch pairs could be an essential prerequisite for optimal adaptation of the tRNAAla acceptor stem to the contact region of the ARS...|$|R
