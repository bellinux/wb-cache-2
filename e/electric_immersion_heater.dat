50|$|In British {{electric}} locomotives the steam generator was usually an electric steam boiler, heated {{by a large}} <b>electric</b> <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> running at the (then) line voltages of 600 volts from a third rail or 1,500 volts from an overhead wire.|$|E
50|$|Where hot-water {{space heating}} boilers are installed, {{domestic}} hot water cylinders are usually heated indirectly by primary water from the boiler, or by an <b>electric</b> <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> (often as backup to the boiler). In the UK these vessels are called indirect cylinders, or direct cylinders, respectively. Additionally, if these cylinders form part of a sealed system, providing mains-pressure hot water, they are known as unvented cylinders. In the US, when connected to a boiler they are called indirect-fired water heaters.|$|E

An automated sub‐system was developed and incorporated to control the hot water draw‐offs and <b>electric</b> <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> to mimic the operation of solar water heating systems in domestic dwellings. The maximum recorded collector outlet fluid temperature was 70. 3 oC while the water temperature {{at the bottom of the}} hot water tank was 59. 5 oC. The annual average daily energy collected was 20. 4 MJd‐ 1, energy delivered by the solar coil was 16. 8 MJd‐ 1, supply pipe loss was 3. 6 MJd‐ 1, solar fraction was 33. 8 %, collector efficiency was 63. 2 % and system efficiency was 52. 0 %. Reducing the supply pipe losses which represented 17. 7 % of energy collected and 21. 5 % of energy delivered to the hot water tank, and developing a better pump control strategy for heavily overcast and intermittent cloud covered days could result in system improvement...|$|E

Hot water tanks {{may have a}} built-in gas or oil burner system, <b>electric</b> <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters.</b> Some types use an external heat exchanger such as a central heating system, or heated water from another energy source.

40|$|In hotels, hospitals, nursing homes, sport centres, {{block of}} flats and apartments {{buildings}} the annual energy demand for heating of domestic hot water (DHW) typically range from 25 to 60 % of the total annual heating demand of the building. Due to the considerable DHW heat load, a centralized DHW system that covers the entire demand {{can be a very}} profitable installation. Possible heating systems include <b>electric</b> <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters,</b> solar collectors in combination with <b>electric</b> <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters</b> for supplementary heating, gas-fired boilers, pellet-fired boilers and heat pump water heaters (HPWH) utilizing e. g. ambient air, exhaust ventilation air, groundwater, boreholes in crystalline rock or grey water as heat source. This papers shows that HPWH systems using carbon dioxide (CO 2, R 744) as working fluid will typically achieve 20 % higher COP than the most energy-efficient HPWH systems on the market using HFC or propane as working fluid. In terms of energy efficiency and utilization of renewable heat it even outperforms state-of-the-art solar heating systems. Air-to-water and water-to-water CO 2 HPWHs in the capacity range from about 5 to 60 kW have now become commercially available in Japan and Europe from a number of Japanese manufacturers...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of engine cooling {{systems can be}} improved by replacing the traditional mechanical driven radiator fan and water pump assemblies with computer controlled components.

5000|$|Home spas are a {{worldwide}} retail item {{in western countries}} since the 1980s, and are sold in dedicated spa stores, pool shops, department stores, the Internet, and catalog sales books. They are almost always made from heat-extruded acrylic sheet Perspex, often colored in marble look-alike patterns. They rarely exceed 6 m2 and are typically 1 m deep, restricted by {{the availability of the}} raw sheet sizes (typically manufactured in Japan). There is often a mid-depth seating or lounging system, and contoured lounger style reclining seats are common. Upmarket spas include various jet nozzles (massage, pulsating, etc.), a drinks tray, lights, LCD flat-screen TV sets and other features that make the pool a recreation center. Due to their family-oriented nature, home spas are normally operated from 36 to 39 C. Many pools are incorporated in a redwood or simulated wood surround, and are termed [...] "portable" [...] as they may be placed on a patio rather than sunken into a permanent location. Some portable spas are shallow and narrow enough to fit sideways through a standard door and be used inside a room. Low power <b>electric</b> <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters</b> are common with home spas.|$|R
40|$|Implementing {{the smart}} grid {{requires}} coordinating competing objectives and constraints from multiple engineering domains. This paper explores the challenges involved in scheduling flexible demand according to objectives in two: the power system and household heat domains. The context is the Northern Isles New Energy Solutions {{project on the}} Shetland Islands, UK, where Active Network Management {{is being used to}} schedule flexible <b>electric</b> storage and <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters.</b> The study highlights that simplifications and assumptions in both domains must be coordinated to understand the overall effectiveness of a scheme. In the case study, customer facing objectives such as home comfort levels are prioritised over the power system objective of reducing fossil fuel generation. Power system operation aggregates houses into a small number of groups to allow practical scheduling. Modelling results show that this prioritisation and aggregation achieves a reduction in fossil fuel generation of 0. 71 GWh; 65 % of that achieved if customer facing objectives are not prioritised...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} is today {{more important than}} ever, mainly due to the high energy prices and the approaching climate changes. Heating of buildings is an essential area within energy efficiency. Many buildings are old and were built {{at a time when}} the energy prices were low and the term “energy efficiency” was unheard of. By applying today’s broad range of energy saving actions on these old, and thereby often, heating ineffective buildings, this area has a large potential in reducing energy consumption and costs. Churches and chapels are generally old buildings with, in many cases, ineffective heating systems and therefore consume much more energy than needed. Significant part of the means of the parish goes to the heating of such a church/chapel, resources that could be used for other purposes instead. Another aspect is that if the heating is not performed properly, it could lead to major damages to the building and its fixtures. The churches of Laholm and Skummeslöv and the chapels of Skogaby and St. Gertrud are all buildings with heating systems that should be looked into. The buildings belong to Laholm Church Communion and they are a part of Gothenburg Diocese. These churches and the chapels are observed to consume a unnecessary large amount of energy at heating, primary because of that the majority of the heating systems are built up by different types of direct electricity, oil filled <b>electric</b> radiators and <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters</b> acting on a waterborne heating system...|$|R

40|$|In this study, an {{electrical}} <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> {{mounted on a}} water tank has been investigated. Themain aim was to reduce heat transfer and to utilize the maximum energy available from heater toheat the water. To observe the effects of essential geometrical and operating parameters on thesystem performance, different computational test cases were run for three different designs. In the first case of simulation, the <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> of existing design mounted on a water tankhas been analyzed. The cold-water tank with inlet and outlet and given appropriate boundaryconditions was used to see the temperature contours inside the water tank and temperature of theimmersion layer itself. In the second case, an insulation plate has been introduced in the <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> head in orderto reduce heat loss by considering the possible heat leakage through the gap inside the heaterhead by radiation. In the third case, an insulation ring has been introduced in the <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> head as asubstitute for the insulation plate which has the same aim as second case. The results obtained from the CFD simulation shows the thermal performance of immersionheater in a water tank for three different cases. The results are helpful in optimizing both heatingelement and <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> by introducing different changes to optimize the design. It showsthat the redesigned <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> and storage tank can provide improved working conditions. Also, at early design stages, CFD simulations {{could be used as}} an effective tool to optimizethermal storage tank parameters, so it may add value to the storage tank and immersion heaterperformance and efficiency, by optimizing the whole thermal heating system design and size. Different materials and geometry design are tested giving the minimum heat losses from thesystem and uniform temperature distribution in the water heater...|$|R

25|$|Electrical <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters</b> may heat water {{immediately}} {{adjacent to}} the heating element high enough to promote the formation of scale, commonly calcium carbonate, in hard water areas. This accumulates on the element, and over time, as the element expands and contracts through its heating cycle, the scale cracks off and drops {{to the bottom of}} the tank, progressively filling up the tank. This reduces the tank's capacity and, where the <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> is secondary to the heating of the water by a coil fed from a gas or oil-fired boiler, can reduce the efficiency of the primary heating source by covering that other coil and in turn reducing its efficiency. Regular flushing-out of accumulated sediment can reduce this problem.|$|R

5000|$|Air {{leaving the}} {{building}} {{when the heat}} pump's compressor is running is usually at around -1° in most versions, thus the unit is extracting heat from the air {{that needs to be}} changed (at around a half an air change per hour) [...] Air entering the house is of course generally warmer than the air processed through the unit so there is a net 'gain'. Care must be taken that these are only used in the correct type of houses. Many specifiers mis-understand that low heat loss means small. Exhaust air heat pumps have minimum flow rates that when installed in a small flat the air flow chronically over ventilates the flat increasing the heat los by drawing in large amounts of unwanted outside air. For most exhaust air heat pumps there will be a low heat output to the hot water and heating of just around 1.2 Kw from the compressor / heat pump process but if that falls short of the building's requirements additional heat will be automatically triggered in the form of <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters</b> or an external gas boiler. The <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> top up will be substantial and when a unit with a 6 kW <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> operates at full output it will cost £1 per hour to run.|$|R

In a typical off-peak installation, a lower <b>immersion</b> <b>heater</b> is connected to the separately switched off-peak heating circuit and an upper heater is connected to the normal circuit via its own switch. The consumer then has the option to top up the available hot water supply at any time, rather than waiting for the cheaper supply to turn on (typically after midnight). A poorly insulated hot water cylinder will increase running costs because a consumer must pay for electricity used to replace lost heat.|$|R

50|$|Most commonly, {{aquarium}} <b>heaters</b> are <b>immersion</b> style <b>heaters,</b> these heaters {{consist of}} a glass tube containing a heating element wound around a ceramic or glass insert. Some glass <b>immersion</b> <b>heaters</b> also contain sand, and most, but not all, are fully submersible. The glass tube also contains an adjustable thermostat which turns the heating element on to maintain the required temperature. This thermostat is often a bimetallic strip; because the strip contains two metals, the metals will expand at different rates when the temperature rises, causing the strip to bend. This strip carries the current, but breaks the current at the correct temperature. The setting of this bimetallic strip can be adjusted. More advanced thermostats may use microchip technology. A small light in the heater is often included to indicate operation.|$|R
