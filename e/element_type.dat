Initially only the long-wheelbase One Ten was available and it was sold with the same engine line-up as the preceding Series III model- 2.25-litre petrol and diesel engines and the 3.5-litre Rover V8. However, Land Rover planned a series of rolling improvements. Launched shortly before the short-wheelbase Ninety model in 1984 was a 2.5-litre diesel engine. This {{was little more than}} an updated version of the existing diesel unit (at this time 22 years old). The stroke was lengthened to improve torque, and an updated cylinder head was used to reduce noise and emissions. A more modern injector pump improved fuel economy and an improved glow plug system improved cold-starting performance. The most significant change was the swapping of the chain-driven camshaft for one driven by a fibre toothed belt, which also drove the repositioned injector pump. The drive vacated by the injector pump was used to power a vacuum pump for the brake servo system. To reduce engine weight, extensive use of aluminium castings was made for the cambelt case, vacuum pump, rocker cover and other parts. Other small improvements were made such as the fitment of a spin-on cartridge oil filter instead of older, harder-to-change <b>element</b> <b>type</b> and the fitting of under-piston oil jets. In the mid-1980s Land Rover was part of the Land Rover Group, responsible for production of the Freight Rover van. The 2.5-litre diesel was fitted to the Freight Rover 300-series and the FX4 taxi (the engines for these applications had slight design changes, such as higher-mounted injector pumps and non-waterproof cambelt cases. They received the designations 14J and 15J respectively. Being fitted with a timing belt rather than a chain the 15J engine suffered none of the reliability problems in the FX4 that its 10J predecessor had encountered (see above)). The engine became a special-order only option after the introduction of turbodiesel engines (see below) but remained in production (and popular with military and some commercial buyers) until 1994. The British Army used this engine {{in the vast majority of}} the 20,000 Land Rovers it bought between 1985 and 1994. A manufacturing flaw with pistons combined with Army maintenance practises (such as a tendency to over-fill the sump with oil) caused the engines to over-breathe and ingest their oil, leading to piston failure. Late military-spec engines had a centrifugal separator in the breather system, allowing excess oil to drain back to the sump. These engines were designated 13J. and 11J (ref Land Rover Defender Military 110 1991 Supplementary Parts Catalogue). These later, modified engines were the first in their class (small capacity high-speed diesels) to pass the Ministry of Defence's arduous 500-hour durability trial.|$|E

[...] Each monster initially has four slots available for abilities. [...] Monsters can quickly learn abilities {{of their own}} <b>element</b> <b>type,</b> but can also pick up abilities from other elements. [...] A fire dragon, for instance, can learn snow-based attacks. [...] Using an ability requires the expenditure of a monster's [...] "Jewel Points", a mana-like energy of which each creature has only a finite amount. [...] When a monster's Jewel Points are depleted, it becomes inaccessible to the character and another monster must be selected to fight. [...] Monsters can return to battle when their Jewel Points have been restored at a save point.|$|E
2500|$|Spectral element {{method is}} a finite <b>element</b> <b>type</b> method. It {{requires}} the mathematical problem (the partial differential equation) to be {{cast in a}} weak formulation. This is typically done by multiplying the differential equation by an arbitrary test function and integrating over the whole domain. Purely mathematically, the test functions are completely arbitrary - they belong to an infinite-dimensional function space. Clearly an infinite-dimensional function space cannot be represented on a discrete spectral element mesh; {{this is where the}} spectral element discretization begins. The most crucial thing is the choice of interpolating and testing functions. In a standard, low order FEM in 2D, for quadrilateral elements the most typical choice is the bilinear test or interpolating function of the form [...] In a spectral element method however, the interpolating and test functions are chosen to be polynomials of a very high order (typically e.g. of the 10th order in CFD applications). This guarantees the rapid convergence of the method. Furthermore, very efficient integration procedures must be used, since the number of integrations to be performed in a numerical codes is big. Thus, high order Gauss integration quadratures are employed, since they achieve the highest accuracy with the smallest number of computations to be carried out.|$|E

These steel floor panels weighed {{less than the}} previous fiberglass floor and reduced interior noise levels. Horsepower rose to [...] for the base L-48 engine; [...] for the optional L-82. To further reduce cabin noise levels, cowl induction was dropped {{in favor of the}} air cleaner ducted over the radiator, picking up outside air {{from the front of the}} car, thus reducing wind turbulence at the base of the windshield. The hood was carried over, with its cowl vent grille and induction system opening becoming non-functional. The optional cast aluminum wheels were finally made available, which reduced the unsprung weight of the car by 32pounds. Nearly 15% of the cars were ordered with the new wheels at a cost of $299. A standard steel rim spare was used. This was the last year for optional white striped tires, as 86% of the cars were being delivered with the optional white lettered tires. A new rear nameplate for the rear bumper cover was introduced, eliminating the individual [...] "Corvette" [...] letters used since 1968. An unwelcome change was the [...] "Vega GT" [...] 4-spoke steering wheel, although its smaller diameter did provide extra room and eased entry/exit. The steering wheel, color-keyed to the interior, continued on 1977 through 1979 models, limited to non-tilt wheel cars only. GM's [...] "Freedom" [...] battery, a new sealed and maintenance-free unit, was now installed in all cars.

For each feature we automatically assign Useful / Not-Useful la-bels to <b>element</b> <b>types</b> using Fuzzy c-Means Clustering. We then rank the features by the accuracy with which they predict the manual judgments. We find strong over-lap between the top-ten most predictive features for the two collections and that seven features achieve high av-erage accuracy (F-measure> 65 %) acrosss them. We hypothesize that an XML retrieval system working on an unlabelled corpus could use these features to decide which retrieval units are most appropriate to return to the user...|$|R

40|$|Conodont {{elements}} {{other than}} those with platform ledges along the processes have often been unrecognized or disregarded in reconstructions and phylogenetic discussions of Ordovician "platform conodont genera. " The platform elements are larger than the other <b>element</b> <b>types</b> and often exhibit more rapid evolutionary changes in morphology. Nevertheless, to understand the evolution of, and relationships between and among "platform genera," {{it is necessary to}} also consider the associated ramiform and geniculate elements. Thus, on the basis of large collections, together comprising 10, 800 elements from Sweden and southern China, all <b>element</b> <b>types</b> of Lenodus antivariabilis (An, 1981), L. variabilis (Sergeeva. 1963), Yangtzeplacognathus crassus (Chen and Zhang, 1993) and Eoplacognathus pseudoplanus (Viira, 1974) are described and discussed.

40|$|In many {{finite element}} {{analysis}} models, there are usually regions that are ideal candidates for dimensional reduction. In order to capture stress concentrations at local details, it would be desirable to combine the reduced dimensional <b>element</b> <b>types</b> with higher dimensional elements in the whole global model. Therefore, it is important in such cases to integrate into the analyses some scheme for coupling the <b>element</b> <b>types</b> that conforms to the governing equations of the problem. In this paper, a novel method that can correctly couple beams to solids, beams to shells and shells to solids for elastic problems is presented. The approach adopted is to equate the work done {{on either side of}} the mixed dimensional interface and this leads to multi-point constraint equations, providing compatible relationships of the nodal degrees of freedom between the differing <b>element</b> <b>types.</b> Example results show that the proposed technique does not introduce any spuhous stresses at the dimensional interface...|$|R
