50|$|In 1683 {{there was}} an alleged Whig {{conspiracy}} to assassinate or mount an insurrection against Charles II of England because of his pro-Roman Catholic policies. This plot {{was known as the}} Rye House Plot, named from Rye House at Hoddesdon, near which ran a narrow road where Charles was supposed to be killed as he travelled from a <b>horse</b> <b>meeting</b> at Newmarket. By chance, according to the official narrative, the king's unexpectedly early departure in March foiled the plot. Ten weeks later, on 1 June, an informer's allegations prompted a government investigation.|$|E

5000|$|... the RHBAA has {{two methods}} of {{registering}} horses.

The second method is open registration, meaning that any <b>horse</b> <b>meeting</b> standards for temperament, gait and conformation may be registered after an evaluation by a licensed commissioner. Adult horses may be ridden for their evaluation, but foals are shown on a loose lead rope. Approximately 80,000 horses have been registered.|$|E
5000|$|Kaufman hired William Goldman {{to write}} the screenplay, but {{after a number of}} {{disputes}} about the focus of the story, Goldman quit and Kaufman wrote the screenplay himself. Goldman wanted the story to portray patriotism and center mostly on the astronauts, whereas Kaufman wanted much of the story to focus on Chuck Yeager (played by Sam Shepard), whom Goldman's script left out completely. Goldman writes in his memoirs, [...] "Phil's heart was with Yeager." [...] And Shepard's biographer, Don Shewey, explains that [...] "though its chief subject is the astronauts, Yeager is the apple of Kaufman's heroic eye." [...] Critic David Thomson agrees: [...] I think Kaufman picked Shepard for the way he represents the movie star as real man and existentialist...a man in a leather jacket on a <b>horse</b> <b>meeting</b> a jet plane in the desert. That is an arresting image, and Shepard is all that Kaufman wanted in The Right Stuff.|$|E

Later, at the appointed time, Ramon is led to the execution post with a distraught Isabel screaming to the annoyance of Montoya. As Grisham is about to give the order to fire, the Queen appears riding on top of two horses and dives on to the first man in the firing squad causing the line to collapse like dominoes. She frees Ramon and takes on the garrison single-handed to enable Ramon to escape. In the confusion Ramon calls to Isabel and she jumps onto the horse Ramon has taken, only for her brother Teodora to take a rifle to shoot Isabel. Stopped by his father, allowing Grisham to arrest him. The Queen escapes on Chico, taking along another <b>horse.</b> <b>Meeting</b> Ramon and Isabel outside town, she tells them to go and never come back.

40|$|Athletic {{production}} {{is what is}} sought from the horse. As mammary development {{is important to the}} dairy cow, skeletal development is important to <b>horses</b> <b>meeting</b> their production goals. As any integrative physiologist will appreciate, the variables that come together to result in optimal skeletal development are complex. Nutrition is one of these, and it contains two broad variables; the supply of dietary nutrients and energy. This presentation will focus on dietary energy and its links with skeletal development. I propose that it is not simply the amount of dietary energy, but the way and from that that energy is supplied that impacts skeletal development. Through an understanding of how dietary energy impact skeletal development, more precise feeding management strategies can be developed {{to reduce the risk of}} skeletal abnormalities and even potentially improve skeletal integrity...|$|R
