40|$|A {{model is}} {{constructed}} for risk management of crude pipeline subject to rupture {{on the basis}} of a methodology that incorporates structured expert judgment and analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The risk model calculates <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> and their probable consequences for different segments of crude pipeline, considering various failure mechanisms. Specifically, structured expert judgment is used to provide <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> assessments for identified failure mechanisms of the pipeline. In addition, AHP approach is utilized to obtain relative failure likelihood for attributes of failure mechanisms with very low probability of occurrence. Finally, the expected cost of failure for a given pipeline segment is estimated by combining its <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> and the consequences of failure, estimated in terms of historical costs of failure from the pipeline operator’s database. A real-world case study of a crude pipeline is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

In recent years, the reliabilities of power plants {{have become increasingly}} important issues in most developed and developing countries. Reliability, availability, maintainability and supportability (RAMS), as well as risk analysis, have become big issues in the power industries. Major causes of customer dissatisfaction often result from unexpected failures, which have led to unanticipated costs in the Afam thermal power-station. However, with proper integration of RAMS and risk analysis in each maintenance process in the Afam thermal power-station, the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>failures</b> can be reduced and their consequences diminished.

Mutants {{that have}} been {{selected}} for defects in phagocytic recognition, adhesion, and vegetative cell-cell cohesion {{were found to be}} larger and more highly multinucleate than their parent strain. This defect is associated with the complex mutant phenotype of these mutants since revertants of the mutants coordinately acquire the wild-type phenotype for all of the defects. The larger size and multinuclearity were due to a high <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> of cytokinesis in cells of wild-type size.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Populations live in {{habitats}} whose quality varies spatially and temporally. Understanding how populations {{deal with}} these variable habitats can aid our understanding of theoretical issues, and practical issues of biological invasions and biodiversity conservation. I investigate these issues by superimposing simple models of population growth and dispersal on spatiotemporally fractal landscapes, and examining {{the properties of the}} landscapes, and of the populations inhabiting them. The properties of the simulated landscape sequences are comparable to those of real habitats. The simulated populations exhibit a range of dynamic behaviors; these behaviors are strongly influenced by the fractal parameters of the landscapes. The results may help explain several important phenomena seen in reintroductions of threatened and endangered species, introductions of biological control agents, and biological invasions. These phenomena include frequently observed lags between population introduction and initial population growth and spread, and the observed high <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> of introductions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{help with}} the {{planning}} and design of distribution automation systems (DASs), the best amount of terminal units (TUs) mounted in a DAS is analyzed {{from the perspective of}} benefit/cost ratio first. From the perspective of reliability, the amount of various kinds of TUs in different situations is studied, that is only TUs with tele-control function, only TUs without tele-control function, a hybrid of TUs with tele-control function and TUs without tele-control function. Some circuit breakers with current protection mounted on some branches arc investigated at length. The following conclusions arc drawn that only one TU for each feeder is the best choice from the viewpoint of benefit/cost ratio, and that the demanded amount of various kinds of TUs depends on the reliability performance desired, the time of isolating the fault section by manual operation, the time of reparation, and the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> per-year.

MethodsA search was made in “colonic inertia”, “colon inertia” and “slow transit constipation” in PubMed database for articles of the last 5 years, in Portuguese or English with available abstract and full text. 59 articles and 2013 guidelines of the American Gastroenterological Association on constipation were included. ResultsThe pathophysiology is not completely elucidated and the reduction of the interstitial cells of Cajal is the most consistent histological finding. Diagnosis requires the exclusion of secondary causes of constipation and obstructed defecation syndrome, to which contribute several complementary diagnostic tests. Given the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> of the medical treatment, surgery is often the only possible option. Sacral nerve stimulation seems to be a promising therapeutical alternative.

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries are among the most commonly occurring problems in the young and active patient population. Higher-grade AC joint injuries (Rockwood types III through VI) represent failure of the coracoclavicular (CC) ligament complex, which is formed by the conoid and trapezoid ligaments. This complex has been termed the primary suspensory structure of the upper limb [1, 2]. In the literature, the incidence of traumatic AC joint separation varies from 3 to 4 per 100, 000 people with 25 - 52 % of these occurring during sporting activities, and they are also one of the most common shoulder injuries seen in orthopaedic trauma-tology [2 - 5]. For certain Rockwood type III AC joint separations and all type IV, V, and VI injuries, surgical treatment has been recommended to prevent disabling pain, weakness, and deformity [6 - 8].

40|$|Target {{levels of}} {{reliability}} for civil engineering designs are normally {{established as a}} matter of policy by specification committees or agency leadership. Target values are generally selected with some balance of consideration among perceived costs in a general sense, the consequences of failure, as well as general historical performance information. Deliberations regarding target levels of reliability seldom explicitly consider the incremental costs that are required to increase the reliability of structures and seldom involve explicit calculations to guide or inform such decisions. An approach to establish target levels of reliability for design of bridge foundations at both strength and serviceability limit states is presented in this paper. The approach combines consideration of “socially acceptable ” risk with economic considerations that seek to minimize the total cost associated with the foundations. Socially acceptable risk is generally represented through so-called FN curves, which describe socially acceptable relations between <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> (F) and the consequences of failure (N), or some other undesired consequence.
