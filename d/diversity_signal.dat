40|$|Abstract — In {{wireless}} communication systems, signal space diversity techniques are usually adopted to combat channel fading by exploiting time diversity, frequency diversity, spatial diversity {{or a combination}} of them. Most existing schemes to achieve signal space diversity are based on linear constellation spreading. In this paper, we propose a novel nonlinear signal space diversity technique based on maximum distance separable (MDS) codes. The new technique provides a design flexibility for almost any number of diversity channels and desired diversity orders. We also propose a simple and suboptimal diversity channel selection (DCS) decoding for our new scheme. DCS decoding can greatly reduce the decoding complexity at a cost of marginal performance loss relative to the optimal detection while keeping the diversity order. Simulation results show that with the same throughput but a lower decoding and implementation complexity, our scheme can have superior performance than the optimal linear spreading schemes over either independent fading or additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels.

40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} experimentally the relationships between cross-polarization discrimination (XPD), signal cross correlation, and polarization diversity gain with horizontally/vertically (HV) polarized reception at the base-station (BS) end at 1800 MHz. The performance of the horizontal/vertical polarization diversity scheme was also compared with a diversity scheme with 645 slanted polarizations and horizontal space diversity at 1800 MHz in a personal communication system (PCS) mobile network. A measurement campaign was conducted in small/micro cells in different types of areas, taking into account the influence of mobile antenna inclination. According to the measurements, XPD values for horizontal/vertical polarizations vary between 5 – 15 dB, depending on the environment. Furthermore, XPD values depend highly on the radio propagation path between the BS and mobile station (MS) due to line-of-sight (LOS) and nonline-of-sight (NLOS) situations. Signal cross correlations of horizontal and vertical polarizations in both LOS and NLOS situations were clearly below 0. 7, which is the generally accepted value to have a reasonable improvement at the receiving end with diversity. Finally, the results showed that almost equal diversity gain and system performance in a PCS network at 1800 MHz can be achieved in small/micro cells in different environments with 645 slanted polarizations at the BS end when comparing results with horizontal space diversity. The performance of horizontal/vertical polarization diversity scheme was approximately 1 dB worse than horizontal space diversity.

40|$|Future {{wireless}} network may {{consist of a}} cluster of low-complexity battery-powered nodes or mobile stations (MS). Information is propagated from one location in the network to another by cooperation and relaying. Due to the channel fading or node failure, one or more relaying links could become unreliable during multiple-hop relaying. Inspired by conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques exploiting multiple co-located transmit antennas to introduce temporal and spatial diversity, the error performance and robustness against channel fading of a multiple-hop cooperative network could be significantly improved by creating a virtual antenna array (VAA) with various distributed MIMO techniques. In this thesis, we concentrate on the low-complexity distributed MIMO designed for both coherent and non-coherent <b>diversity</b> <b>signal</b> reception at the destination node. Further improvement on the network throughput as well as spectral efficiency could be achieved by extending the concept of unidirectional relaying to bidirectional cooperative communication. Physical-layer network coding (PLNC) assisted distributed space-time block coding (STBC) scheme as well as non-coherent PLNC aided distributed differential STBC system are proposed. It is confirmed by the theoretical analysis that both approaches {{have the potential for}} offering full spatial diversity gain. Furthermore, differential encoding and non-coherent detection techniques are generally associated with performance degradation due to the doubled noise variance. More importantly, conventional differential schemes suffer from the incapability of recovering the source information in time-varying channels owing to the assumption of static channel model used in the derivation of non-coherent detection algorithm. Several low-complexity solutions are proposed and studied in this thesis, which are able to compensate the performance loss caused by non-coherent detection and guarantee the reliable recovery of information in applications with high mobility. A substantial amount of iteration gain is achieved by combining the differential encoding with error-correction code and sufficient interleaving, which allows iterative possessing at the receiver...|$|E

40|$|Osmoregulation is {{critical}} to life and is tightly regulated by integrated physiological and behavioral responses to maintain the osmolality of body fluid. In particular, this involves recovery from dehydration both at the intracellular and extracellular levels. To achieve appropriate body fluid balance, three major hormones namely secretin (SCT), angiotensin II (ANGII) and vasopressin (VP) are responsible. Of note, SCT and ANGII share overlapping physiological roles including similar expression pattern within the brain, dipsogenic actions and activation of VP expression and/or release in mice. However, it remains unclear how their receptor pathways may cross-interact to aid osmoregulation. In recent years, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) oligomerization has been implicated to play roles in regulating processes such as expression, pharmacological <b>diversity,</b> <b>signal</b> transduction and internalization. Though not as extensively studied, class B GPCRs are also gaining merit in their oligomerization abilities, within which the wealth of available information is focused on SCT receptor (SCTR) homomers and heteromers. Moreover, {{there is also evidence}} indicating the ability for ANGII receptors to oligomerize. On the basis of this information, this project predominantly aims to explore the molecular association between SCTR and ANGII receptors via in vitro experiments and provide insights into its physiological relevance. In this study, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays revealed SCTR and ANGII type 1 a receptor (AT 1 aR) to form hetero-complexes. This oligomerization event was found by BRET competition to be contributed predominantly by transmembrane (TM) domain regions 2 and 4 in SCTR, and TM 1 and TM 4 in AT 1 aR. Within which, combinational use of mutant TM peptides and SCTR chimeras revealed the importance of lipid-exposed residues, particularly Leu 204 and Ser 205 in SCTR TM 2 as key contact points for formation of the SCTR/AT 1 aR complex. Morphologically, the heteromers were visualized by confocal FRET imaging at the cell surface and found have a role in modulating AT 1 aR trafficking. It was also found that the SCTR/AT 1 aR complex affected Gαs signaling specifically, reducing maximal response values by 24. 3 ± 2. 8 % compared to CHO-K 1 cells transfected with only SCTR. While, this negative effect could be abolished by co-application of SCT and ANGII peptides, use of constitutively active AT 1 aR mutants or disruption of the hetero-complex using SCTR mutants. Taken together, the SCTR/AT 1 aR complex was proposed to impose conformational restraints on the SCTR that could be overcome upon activation of the AT 1 aR. Physiologically, hyperosmolality isovolemic induced drinking could be attenuated by central administration of TM peptides and the protein kinase A pathway blocker H- 89, indicating receptor oligomerization to have a role in neural osmoregulation via a Gαs dependent pathway. This study presents novel findings regarding the receptor oligomerization of SCTR and AT 1 aR, which may be the molecular basis to the overlapping roles of SCT and ANGII in water homeostasis. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
