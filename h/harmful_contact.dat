40|$|Harmful {{activities}} {{by means of}} modern technology also include detrimental contacts when abchild is targeted and chosen as a victim by another child or adult person. The paper deals with presentation of preliminary research results concerning the group of <b>harmful</b> <b>contacts</b> that pertain to the involvement in activities related to the Internet child pornography. The research analyzed the probation service documentation of 76 cases of convicted perpetrators of child exploitation for purposes of the Internet pornography. The presentation of the results includes information on the perpetrators and type of offenses, {{in addition to other}} data which will contribute to better understanding of criminal offenses that harm children and juveniles through child pornography and electronic violence. The presentation of the results aims at objectives analysis but also contributes to the sparse field of research...|$|R
50|$|Apprehension is {{a broader}} term than fear. If a {{defendant}} intends {{to cause the}} plaintiff to actually fear a <b>harmful</b> <b>contact,</b> for example, it will therefore always suffice as apprehension, {{but there are other}} ways to achieve apprehension as well.|$|E
5000|$|Intentional Act. Was the <b>harmful</b> <b>contact</b> the {{conscious}} {{object of the}} defendant? Did the defendant intend to cause the resulting harm? Though the necessity of intent remains {{an integral part of}} Commonwealth battery, some Commonwealth jurisdictions have moved toward the American jurisprudence of [...] "substantial certainty". If a reasonable person in the defendant's position would apprehend the substantial certainty of the consequences of his actions, whether the defendant intended to inflict the injuries is immaterial.|$|E
5000|$|An act which, {{directly}} or indirectly, {{is the legal}} cause of a <b>harmful</b> <b>contact</b> with another's person makes the actor liable to the other, if:(a) the act is done {{with the intention of}} bringing about a harmful or offensive contact or an apprehension thereof to the other or a third person, and(b) contact is not consented to by the other or the other's consent thereto is procured by fraud or duress, and(c) the contact is not otherwise privileged.|$|E
50|$|Cystamine is {{an organic}} disulfide. It is formed when cystine is heated, {{the result of}} decarboxylation. Cystamine is an {{unstable}} liquid and is generally handled as the dihydrochloride salt, C4H12N2S2·2HCl, which is stable to 203-214 °C at which point it decomposes.

50|$|Offenses {{requiring}} basic intent {{specify a}} mens rea element {{that is no}} more than the intentional or reckless commission of the actus reus. The actor either knew (intended) or deliberately closed his mind to the risk (recklessness) that his action (actus reus) would result in the harm suffered by the victim. The crime of battery, for example, only requires the basic intent that the actor knew or should have known that his action would lead to <b>harmful</b> <b>contact</b> with the victim.|$|E

40|$|Social {{networking}} {{sites have}} been rapidly adopted by children and, especially, teenagers {{and young people}} worldwide, enabling new opportunities for {{the presentation of the}} self, learning, construction of a wide circle of relationships, and the management of privacy and intimacy. On the other hand, there are also concerns that social networking increases the likelihood of new risks to the self, these centring on loss of privacy, bullying, <b>harmful</b> <b>contacts</b> and more. This article reviews recent findings regarding children and teenagers’ social networking practices in order to identify implications for future research and public policy. These focus on the interdependencies between opportunities and risks, the need for digital or media literacy education, the importance of building safety considerations into the design and management of social networking sites, the imperative for greater attention to ‘at risk’ children in particular, and the importance of a children’s rights framework in developing evidence-based policy in this area...|$|R
40|$|Enterocystoplasty and gastrocystoplasty {{have been}} {{developed}} to restore adequate bladder capacity but they still result in the undesired <b>harmful</b> <b>contact</b> of urine with the intestinal mucosa. In an attempt to prevent this nonphysiological interface we performed several modified enterocystoplasties in the mini-pig model using a pedicled, detubularized, de-epithelialized sigmoid patch. Five techniques of patch coverage were used to evaluate urothelial growth or survival on the sigmoid patch. All but 1 patch had intestinal mucosa remnants with mucocele formation. When no coverage was applied or a biodegradable polyglactin mesh was temporarily covering the pedicled, detubularized, de-epithelialized sigmoid patch, severe shrinkage occurred. Partial cover with autologous urothelium islets seemed to decrease shrinkage. Adequate urothelium survival and satisfactory elastic properties of the patch were observed when total cover of the sigmoid patch was achieved with a sheet of homologous urothelium recovering autologous urothelial islets or when the patch was applied to protruding urothelium obtained following sagittal posterior detrusor myotomy...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} solve the serious backup roll {{spalling}} of roughing mill during ultra-wide stainless steel rolling process, a 3 D elastic deformation finite element model of 4 -high roll stacks was established for simulating the mechanical behavior during the hot rolling process. The asymmetric contact pressure between backup and work rolls is the key factor for the frequent roll spalling accidents. Based {{on the principle of}} homogenizing contact pressure between rolls, minimizing <b>harmful</b> <b>contact</b> zone in different strip widths and considering roll wearing as a whole, SCR (Smart Contact Backup Rolls) was developed. The simulation reveals when using the SMS 200 backup roll contour, the peak position of contact pressure keeps consistent with the practical spalling position. Instead, the peak value of the roll contact pressure with SCR technology decreases significantly with various strip widths. The unevenness coefficients of roll contact pressure with SCR technology decline sharply from 1. 36 and more to less than 1. 18 with different strip widths. The roll consumption decreases from 0. 1254 kg/t to 0. 055 kg/t. During the continuous strip production of 20 million tons and more, non-occurring backup roll spalling, uniform roll wear and remarkable decrease in roll consumption have been validated by long-term industrial applications of the 2250 hot strip mill...|$|E
50|$|Three {{elements}} must {{be established}} {{in order to establish}} tortious assault: first, there must be a positive act by the defendant; second, the plaintiff had reasonable apprehension (the requisite state of mind) of immediate physical contact, and third, the defendant's act of interference was intentional (the defendant intended the resulting apprehension). But intent for purposes of civil assault can be either general or specific. Specific intent means that when the defendant acted, he or she intended to cause apprehension of a <b>harmful</b> or unwanted <b>contact.</b> General intent means that the defendant knew with substantial certainty that the action would put someone in apprehension of a <b>harmful</b> or unwanted <b>contact.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{criminal}} and civil law, assault {{is an attempt to}} initiate <b>harmful</b> or offensive <b>contact</b> with a person, or a threat to do so. [...] It is distinct from battery, which refers to the actual achievement of such contact.|$|R
40|$|For years, {{the law has}} {{grappled with}} {{the extent to which}} an {{individual}} can consent to <b>harmful</b> physical <b>contact.</b> This has never been more evident than in the area of hazing. Courts have fallen {{on both sides of this}} divide, often enough speculating about the mental state of the alleged hazing victim. The question is often whether the individual had the psychological wherewithal to resist situational or contextual demands placed on him or her. In this Article, the authors provide clarity to how the law has thought about this issue and how it should think about it in light of a range of psychological theories and empirical research...|$|R
50|$|A person commits {{a battery}} when he acts either {{intending}} {{to cause a}} <b>harmful</b> or offensive <b>contact</b> with another or intending to cause another imminent apprehension of such contact and when such contact results.

Therefore, there is {{a variety of ways}} in which a person can commit an assault.|$|R
2500|$|The {{compound}} CdTe {{has different}} qualities {{than the two}} elements, cadmium and tellurium, taken separately. Toxicity studies show that CdTe is less toxic than elemental cadmium. CdTe has low acute inhalation, oral, and aquatic toxicity, and is negative in the Ames mutagenicity test. Based on notification of these results to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), CdTe is no longer classified as harmful if ingested nor <b>harmful</b> in <b>contact</b> with skin, and the toxicity classification to aquatic life has been reduced. Once properly and securely captured and encapsulated, CdTe used in manufacturing processes may be rendered harmless.

50|$|In common law, assault is the tort {{of acting}} intentionally, that is with either general or {{specific}} intent, causing the reasonable apprehension of an immediate <b>harmful</b> or offensive <b>contact.</b> Because assault requires intent, {{it is considered}} an intentional tort, {{as opposed to a}} tort of negligence. Actual ability to carry out the apprehended contact is not necessary. In Criminal Law an assault is defined as an attempt to commit battery, requiring the specific intent to cause physical injury.|$|R
50|$|Assault usually accompanies battery if {{the assailant}} both threatens to make {{unwanted}} contact and then carries {{through with this}} threat. See common assault. The elements of battery are (1) a volitional act (2) done {{for the purpose of}} causing a <b>harmful</b> or offensive <b>contact</b> with another person or under circumstances that make such contact substantially certain to occur and (3) which causes such contact. Thus throwing a rock at someone for the purpose of hitting him is a battery if the rock in fact strikes the person, and is an assault if the rock misses.|$|R
