25|$|In 1700, {{three small}} Spanish villages were founded {{in what is}} now the {{outskirts}} of Hermosillo, Nuestra Señora del Pópulo, Nuestra Señora de Los Angeles and la Santísima Trinidad del Pitic. The native peoples <b>here</b> <b>soon</b> became hostile to the Spanish and managed to drive them out several times in the early 18th century. In 1716, the Spanish offered irrigated lands for farmers to natives who agreed to abide by Spanish law. Around 1726, a fort named the Presidio of Pitic was constructed to stop the domination of this area by the natives, especially the Seri. However, the situation did not settle soon so that the first church was not built until 1787 and the first formal parish was not established until 1822.|$|E
500|$|Two years later, Catherine faced a new {{crisis with}} the death of Charles IX at the age of twenty-three. His dying words were [...] "oh, my mother...". The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, where he had been elected king the year before. However, three months after his {{coronation}} at Wawel Cathedral, Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become king of France. Catherine wrote to Henry of Charles IX's death: [...] "I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which he showed me at the end... My only consolation is to see you <b>here</b> <b>soon,</b> as your kingdom requires, and in good health, for if I were to lose you, I would have myself buried alive with you." ...|$|E
2500|$|While in Indianapolis, Wheatley married actor Galway Herbert on June 6, 1911, in {{a simple}} {{ceremony}} before a justice of the peace. [...] They had been engaged for two years. [...] "Mr. Herbert came <b>here</b> <b>soon</b> after the stock company season opened, and one day we just ran down to the squire's office and were married," [...] Wheatley told the Indianapolis Star. [...] "No one in the company knew of marriage except Mr. [...] Kenyon and Miss Lillian Sinnott, who 'stood up' with us." [...] (Indianapolis Star, July 8, 1911).|$|E

2500|$|Paramahansa Yogananda {{started a}} small ashram in Dihika, West Bengal (near Asansol), in 1917 prior to moving to Ranchi, where he {{established}} and developed {{his first major}} ashram in India. The original site where Paramahansa Yogananda started his fledgling Dihika ashram, has been purchased in 1992 by Yogoda Satsanga Society of India and is being maintained by them as a heritage site of the organization. [...] "In 1997 YSS started a Kendra <b>here.</b> <b>Soon</b> thereafter, a charitable homeopathic dispensary was added. From mid 2010, this Kendra was slowly remodeled into a retreat center with a boundary wall and a guesthouse. Subsequently, the work of constructing a Dhyana Mandir — with an accommodation for about 75 devotees — has been completed at this site." ...|$|E
2500|$|The two next {{encounter}} {{a group of}} friars accompanying a lady in a carriage. Don Quixote takes the friars to be enchanters who hold the lady captive, knocks a friar from his horse, and is immediately challenged by an armed Basque traveling with the company. As he has no shield, the Basque uses a pillow to protect himself, which saves him when Don Quixote strikes him. Cervantes chooses this point, {{in the middle of}} the battle, to say that his source ends <b>here.</b> <b>Soon,</b> however, he resumes Don Quixote's adventures after a story about finding Arabic notebooks containing the rest of the story by Cid Hamet Ben Engeli. The combat ends with the lady leaving her carriage and commanding those traveling with her to [...] "surrender" [...] to Don Quixote.|$|E
2500|$|With {{collapse}} of Russia and {{the signing of}} the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk the occupying German forces had a quiet time but the subsequent {{collapse of}} German Empire and the Allied denunciation of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty changed everything. The Independence of Republic of Latvia was proclaimed in November 18, 1918 and the Latvian Provisional Government under Karlis Ulmanis was created. Bolshevik Russia now advanced into Latvian territory and met little resistance <b>here.</b> <b>Soon</b> the Provisional Government and remaining German units were forced to leave Riga and retreated all the way to Liepāja, but then the Red offensive stalled along the Venta river. A Latvian Soviet Republic was announced. Latvia now became the main theatre of Baltic operations for the remaining German forces in 1919. In addition, a Landeswehr was formed to work in conjunction with the German forces.|$|E

2500|$|At the time, George II had to {{accompanied}} [...] "Trux" [...] to Hanover. Frederick then summoned him to Silesia. <b>Here,</b> <b>soon</b> afterwards, he {{drew the}} king's anger, for which {{there seemed to be}} more reason, when, in confidence, [...] "Trux" [...] sent an officer to Olmütz, to take charge of deserters. The king then wrote to him. [...] "I believe that you are only fifteen [...] in number, in view of the extraordinary conduct which you have taken from the officers at Olmütz to demand deserters, be wary, or after so many such cases of discontent, you and I will quarrel." [...] A few months later, however, [...] "Trux" [...] convinced the king of his own good intentions, at the Battle of Lösch, and was with the Prussian army sent to Brünn, where, on 14 [...] March [...] 1742, [...] "Trux" [...] received the order to take the Veveří Castle. He was attacked by an Austrian force {{three times the size of}} his; he withdrew into a castle, but the Austrians set it on fire, forcing him to withdraw.|$|E
