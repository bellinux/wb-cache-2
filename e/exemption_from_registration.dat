40|$|Crowdfunding-the {{use of the}} Internet {{to raise}} money through small {{contributions}} from {{a large number of}} investors-could cause a revolution in small-business financing. Through crowdfunding, smaller entrepreneurs, who traditionally have had great difficulty obtaining capital, have access to anyone in the world with a computer, Internet access, and spare cash to invest. Crowdfunding sites such as Kiva, Kickstarter, and IndieGoGo have proliferated, and the amount of money raised through crowdfunding has grown to billions of dollars in just a few years.

40|$|The Securities Act of 1933 is an {{important}} restriction on capital markets in the United States. Unless an exemption is available, the Act requires companies selling securities to the public first to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a registration statement containing detailed information about the company, its business, its finances, and the contemplated offering. Offers cannot be made (except to underwriters) until the registration statement is filed, and the securities can be sold only after the registration statement survives the sometimes lengthy SEC review process and becomes effective. In addition, the securities seller must at some point furnish investors with a prospectus, which contains {{much of the information}} in the registration statement. Economic analysis of the Securities Act, both theoretical and empirical, has focused on the desirability of the registration requirement. Some scholars have questioned whether the registration requirement is economically sound; others have argued that mandatory disclosure is necessary to correct market failures in the securities markets. Lost in the debate on the economic merits of the registration requirement are the <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> that requirement-the offerings for which registration is not required. This Article fills the gap in the economic analysis of the Securities Act by examining the economics of the <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> <b>registration.</b> I will assume for the purpose of analysis that, in at least some cases, the registration requirement is economically sound: its benefits exceed its costs. I will then review the exemptions to see why that conclusion might not hold for particular types of exempted offerings. For the reader who believes the registration requirement is economically efficient, my analysis of the exemptions will highlight offerings in which that efficiency is less likely. For the reader who believes the registration requirement is economically inefficient, my analysis of the exemptions will highlight offerings for which the inefficiency is greatest. I begin in Part II with a brief focus on the registration requirement itself. Part II summarizes the economic debate concerning registration and, as a prelude to an economic analysis of the exemptions, discusses {{the costs and benefits of}} registration. In Part III, I turn to the <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> <b>registration</b> and ask why, if the benefits of registration generally exceed the costs, that might not be true for these exempted offerings. The transaction exemptions are extraordinarily different from each other. Some exemptions limit the dollar amount of the offering; others limit the number or types of purchasers to whom securities can be sold; others are contingent on oversight by some authority other than the SEC. I show that the exemptions can be placed into three categories, each with a slightly different economic justification. After establishing an economic model for each type of exemption, I explore some of the requirements of the current exemptions to see if they are economically sound. In Part IV, I focus on one particular feature of some of the exemptions-limits on the number of purchasers in an offering. Finally, in Part V, I examine an issue that has caused great difficulty for scholars, practitioners, the courts, and the SEC: What should happen when a single issuer makes two ostensibly separate, but roughly contemporaneous offerings and claims a different exemption for each? In determining whether an exemption is available, should the offerings be combined and treated as a single offering, or should their separation be respected? I explore how well the integration doctrine and the safe-harbor regulations that the SEC and the courts have developed to deal with this problem fit the economic model...|$|R
40|$|Federal {{securities}} law {{is in the}} midst of a revolution. Since 1933, the registration of securities offerings under the Securities Act of 19331 (the 2 ̆ 2 Securities Act 2 ̆ 2) and the exemptions from the registration requirement have rested on the elusive concept of 2 ̆ 2 transaction. 2 ̆ 2 The transactional system has three foundational elements: (1) current registration of discrete offerings [...] the idea that an issuer may register only discrete offerings of securities planned to be sold in the immediate future; (2) resale restrictions arising out of the underwriter concept [...] the idea that securities acquired in an exempted offering are not freely resalable; and (3) the integration doctrine [...] the idea that an entire offering, not individual offers and sales, must qualify for a single <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>registration.</b> That foundation is crumbling rapidly and the changes have not been uniform across all three elements of the system. It is time to free the Securities Act registration exemptions from their transactional underpinnings. The integration doctrine and the complex system of metaphysics, safe harbors, and informal interpretations that keep the system (barely) alive should be abolished, and replaced with the weighted exemption system proposed in this Article. A weighted exemption system would fulfill all of the goals of the current system at a substantially lower cost to issuers, the SEC, and the investing public...|$|E
40|$|Crowdfunding is a {{term used}} in many {{different}} contexts. The conversation surrounding crowdfunding encompasses diverse considerations and interests. In its broadest sense, crowdfunding is a technological fundraising medium for businesses, projects, or charitable causes. Instead of dealing with a financial institution or specific angel investors or venture capital funds, crowdfunded start-ups try to raise money from a worldwide 2 ̆ 2 crowd. 2 ̆ 2 Some crowdfunding campaigns solicit donations and pre-orders, such as Kickstarter or Gofundme. Others sell securities. This Comment will only address the rules that apply to crowdfunding campaigns which offer securities. Securities laws have two prime directives. First, companies can only offer and sell securities in a registered offering or in an offering that satisfies the requirements of an <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>registration.</b> Second, these businesses must not misstate material facts or omit material facts if the omission would make its other disclosures misleading to investors. Primarily, the JOBS Act and other crowdfunding laws focus on the first prime directive. They create exemptions from registration that allow businesses to crowdfund, utilize general solicitation and, in some cases, offer and sell securities to non-accredited investors. These new exemptions present exciting and important changes that democratize the capital raising process by allowing new subsets of businesses to communicate with a broader investor base than ever before. This Comment will briefly discuss these updated exemptions with a particular focus on Title II of the JOBS Act and the related SEC Rule 506 (c), as well as Title IV of the JOBS Act and what some call Regulation A+. Both Rule 506 (c) and Regulation A+ are revolutionary because they change who may talk to investors and the technologies {{that may be used}} to reach them. The primary focus of this Comment is to discuss these securities laws 2 ̆ 7 requirements for disclosures to investors in light of the brave new world crowdfunding offers. On their face, the updated exemptions change very little about what issuers must say to investors. The disclosure challenges posed by the updated exemptions affect new issuers who have little prior disclosure experience and may have very low compliance budgets. These challenges require such new issuers to comply with traditional securities disclosure rules when they are talking to a less sophisticated crowd of investors than ever before utilizing new technological platforms that are constantly evolving. This Comment discusses how and why an issuer taking advantage of these updated exemptions might inadvertently violate securities disclosure laws when the speaker changes, the audience changes, or the disclosure platform changes, and how to avoid potential traps these changes create when paired with newly available disclosure platforms...|$|E
