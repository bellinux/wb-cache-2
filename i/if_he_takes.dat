5|$|David prepares Weyland for an {{excursion}} to the Engineer ship. Shaw asks David {{about his}} freedom after Weyland's eventual demise, {{to which he}} ominously asks about every child's dream of having their parents dead. He leads the team to the flight deck of the ship, where he awakens and speaks with the Engineer, who reacts by decapitating him and killing {{the rest of the}} team, save for Shaw. David's severed head watches from the floor as the Engineer launches the ship and attempts to embark for Earth. After the ship is disabled by Prometheus getting purposefully crashed into it, David warns Shaw that the Engineer is coming for her. David contacts Shaw after she escapes the Engineer and convinces her to retrieve his head and body, so that he may pilot another ship. Shaw dictates that she will cooperate with him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> them to the Engineer home world, which he agrees to, despite not understanding her motivations. Together, they depart from the moon aboard an Engineer ship.|$|E
25|$|The bowler is {{credited}} in the statistics with having taken a wicket if the batsman is out bowled, LBW, caught, stumped, or hit wicket. If {{the ball is}} a no ball then the batsman cannot be out {{in any of these}} ways. The bowler is not credited with having taken a wicket if the batsman is run out, hits the ball twice, or obstructs the field; these dismissals may occur even when the delivery is a no ball. The fieldsman {{is credited}} in the statistics with a dismissal <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> a catch or a stumping (for a stumping this will necessarily be the wicket-keeper), and may be credited on scorecards for a run-out (although a run-out will not be credited to a player's statistics).|$|E
25|$|Fred {{comes down}} with an illness and is cured by Mr. Lydgate, the newest doctor in Middlemarch. Rosamond, who is well-educated and seeks {{to make a good}} match, decides to marry Lydgate and uses Fred's {{sickness}} as an opportunity to get close to the doctor. Though he initially views their relationship as pure flirtation, Lydgate backs away from Rosamond after discovering that the town considers them practically engaged. However, after seeing her a final time, he breaks his resolution to abandon his relationship with Rosamond and the two become engaged. At roughly the same time, Casaubon, returned from Rome, suffers a heart attack. Lydgate is brought in to deal with him and informs Dorothea that, in all likelihood, Casaubon only has around fifteen years left <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> it easy and ceases his studies. Meanwhile, as Fred recovers, Mr. Featherstone becomes ill. On his deathbed, he reveals that he has two wills and tries to get Mary to help him destroy one. Unwilling to be mixed up in the business of his will, she refuses, and Featherstone dies with the two wills still intact.|$|E

500|$|A You is {{a troubled}} 19-year-old who dislikes his life; {{he feels that}} his entire life is unlucky, yet he avoids hard work [...] and prefers to be lazy. He is {{encouraged}} by {{the people around him}} to work harder and told that he can change his life <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> control of it, but A You refuses to accept these notions. One day, he accidentally takes the wrong bus and finds himself in the suburbs of his city. A You enjoys his time away and takes shelter inside of a large, hollow tree when it begins to rain. After taking a nap and waking up, he wanders until he comes across a small, green old man referred to as Grandpa Beard. Grandpa Beard decides to help A You with his problems and transports him to a [...] "utopia" [...] called Abi Port in an alternate world.|$|E
500|$|Commentators {{have agreed}} that this is largely a {{reiteration}} of the previous common law rule on the duty of care. In Speight v Gaunt, Lord Blackburn said that [...] "as a general rule a trustee sufficiently discharges his duty <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> in managing trust affairs all those precautions which an ordinary prudent man of business would take in managing similar affairs of his own", similar to an objective test. It has been {{pointed out that the}} new duty of care creates problems, because it sets a fixed, objective point. It is not known where this point is, however - a professional trustee obviously cannot be held to the standards of a lay trustee, but it has been seen as equally unfair that a lay trustee would be held to the standards of a professional one. This duty, unlike the previous common law duty, at no point requires the trustee to act. The duty of care has been seen to be advantageous to charities compared to the old one, because it allows those charities forced to employ lay trustees to use professional agents to exercise some duties.|$|E
2500|$|... 104. And this is {{the third}} serfdom: if one acts as someone’s {{official}} or servant without the master’s knowledge; if there is an agreement, then whatever they decide, thus he shall be. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> the master’s tasks, he’s his servant.|$|E
60|$|He {{walked off}} with his 'ead in the air, and <b>if</b> <b>'e</b> <b>took</b> that letter out once and looked at it, he did five times.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her, then looked away again, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> no notice of her. But {{as a matter}} of fact, she {{interested}} him deeply.|$|R
50|$|In law, avowry {{is where}} one takes a {{distress}} for rent or other thing, {{and the other}} sues replevin. In which case the taker shall justify, in his plea, for what cause <b>he</b> <b>took</b> it, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> {{it in his own}} right, is to show it, and so avow the taking - which is called his avowry. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> it in the right of another, when he has shown the cause, he is to make conusance of the taking, as being a bailiff or servant to him in whose right he did it.|$|R
2500|$|Part the Second {{is divided}} into four sections: [...] "To Lovers", [...] "To the Wife", [...] "To the Friend" [...] and [...] "To your Good Sort of People; being an {{appendage}} to the foregoing chapter". To wives, she tells them to [...] "Be out of humour when your husband brings company home: be angry, if he goes abroad without you; and troublesome, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> you with him." [...] When speaking to friends, she argues that [...] "injuries go nearest to us, that we neither deserve nor expect".|$|E
2500|$|Further, {{this too}} should be said. Anyone who asserts that god exists either says that god {{takes care of}} the things in the cosmos or that he does not, and, if he does take care, that it is either of all things or of some. Now <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> care of everything, there would be no {{particular}} evil thing and no evil in general in the but the Dogmatists say that everything is full of evil; therefore god shall not be said to take care of everything. On the other hand, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> care of only some things, why does he take care of these and not of those? For either he wishes but is not able, or he is able but does not wish, or he neither wishes nor is able. If he both wished and was able, he would have taken care of everything; but, for the reasons stated above, he does not take care of everything; therefore, it is not the case that he both wishes and is {{able to take care of}} everything. But if he wishes and is not able, he is weaker than the cause on account of which he is not able to take care of the things of which he does not take care; but it is contrary to the concept of god that he should be weaker than anything. Again, if he is able to take care of everything but does not wish to do so, he will be considered malevolent, and if he neither wishes nor is able, he is both malevolent and weak; but to say that about god is impious. Therefore, god does not take care of the things in the cosmos.|$|E
2500|$|Albus Dumbledore {{appears in}} some episodes of Robot Chicken voiced by Seth Green. In [...] "Password: Swordfish" [...] when {{the threat of}} the puberty {{creature}} Pubertis is known, Dumbledore gives Harry a stone that might help him fight Pubertis. During this appearance, Dumbledore is an African-American who states that he is played by a different actor in each of the movies. Upon confrontation with Pubertis, Harry rubs the stone two times, which summons ghosts to punch it. When it comes to the third time, Dumbledore appears and tells Harry that the stone can only be warmed up three times a day (four <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> a week off) and that Pubertis cannot be destroyed since it lives in everyone just like his own demon Wandus Limpus prevents him from having meaningful relationships. In [...] "Tell My Mum", Dumbledore tells the students that Professor Snape suffered a [...] "minor potion accident" [...] and has enlisted Criss Angel as their substitute teacher.|$|E

2500|$|The game {{world has}} coins {{scattered}} around it for Mario to collect, and special bricks {{marked with a}} question mark (?), which when hit from below by Mario, may reveal more coins or a special item. Other [...] "secret", often invisible, bricks may contain more coins or rare items. If the player gains a red and yellow Super Mushroom, Mario grows to double his size and can take one extra hit from most enemies and obstacles, {{in addition to being}} able to break bricks above him. Players are given a certain number of lives, and may gain additional lives by picking up green and orange 1-Up mushrooms, collecting 100 coins, defeating several enemies in a row with a Koopa shell, or bouncing on enemies successively without touching the ground. Mario loses a life <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> damage while small, falls in a bottomless pit, or runs out of time. The game ends when all lives are lost.|$|E
