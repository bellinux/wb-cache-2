He is told that Gawain has left again, seeking a better remedy. Raising himself somewhat, the King says going off without leave ("?") <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> impulsiveness which led himself into Klingsor's realm and to his downfall. He accepts the potion from Gurnemanz and tries to thank Kundry, but she answers abruptly that thanks will not help and urges him onward to his bath.|$|E

I was at the camp to-day, and just in one little corner this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing I found – The nurse, underfed and overworked, just sinking on to her bed, hardly able to hold herself up, after coping with some thirty typhoid and other patients, with only the untrained help of two Boer girls–cooking as well as nursing to do herself.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers criticized Lone Survivor for {{focusing}} more on its action scenes than on characterization. In {{his review}} for The Star-Ledger, Stephen Whitty wrote, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> bare-bones story that well served plenty of World War II movies once, {{and it would}} work here, if Berg had the sense to develop these men as characters, first. But we don't really get to know any of them, or what they might bring personally to this life-or-death emergency." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday wrote, [...] "The movie seems more concerned with military-style action than with telling us who these fallen heroes really were." ...|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} critical acclaim from music critics, with many citing it as {{a highlight of}} the album. Paul Lester from BBC felt that the song was [...] "generic machine RnB". Evan Sawdey from PopMatters commented that [...] "Dance in the Dark", along with [...] "Monster" [...] are a [...] "delightfully dirty retro workout ..... to make for one surprisingly effective pop cocktail." [...] Scott Plagenhoef from Pitchfork Media felt that Gaga had morphed into Madonna on the song. Nick Levine from Digital Spy commented that [...] "'Dance in the Dark' <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> song that, well, {{makes you want to}} dance with your top off in a grotty German bondage basement." [...] Edna Gunderson from USA Today called the song [...] "campy".|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive, however. The American Mathematical Society's Deborah Loewenberg Ball and Hyman Bass {{reviewed}} {{the book from}} a mathematical perspective. Although they praised its [...] "attractive and imaginative fantasy," [...] the two mathematicians found several issues. Ball and Bass were concerned with The Number Devil negative characterization of math teachers, its apparent presentation of mathematics as magical rather than factual, {{and a number of}} other contentions. Ted Dewan, writing for the Times Educational Supplement, believed it to be [...] "far more compelling than a standard text," [...] but found it less adventurous than he hoped for. He also criticized its use in mathematics education, stating [...] "I suspect this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> book that well-meaning adults will mistakenly thrust upon children because it will be good for them." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{weight of}} information, and its {{constant}} repetition, made an apparently strong case against Driberg, and former friends such as Mervyn Stockwood, the Bishop of Southwark, {{became convinced that}} he had indeed betrayed his country. Other friends and colleagues were more sceptical. According to ex-Labour MP Reginald Paget, not even the security services were [...] "lunatic enough to recruit a man like Driberg", who was famously indiscreet and could never keep a secret. Mitrokhin's [...] "blackmail" [...] story is questioned by historian Jeff Sharlet, {{on the grounds that}} by the 1950s and 1960s Driberg's homosexuality had been an open secret in British political circles for many years; he frequently boasted of his [...] "rough trade" [...] conquests to his colleagues. The journalist A. N. Wilson quotes Churchill commenting years before that [...] "Tom Driberg <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> person who gives sodomy a bad name".|$|E
500|$|Quatermass 2 {{received}} mixed reviews. Campbell Dixon in The Daily Telegraph {{found the}} film “all good grisly fun, if this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing you enjoy”. The reviewer in The Times remarked that “the {{writer of the}} original story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air {{of respect for the}} issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally”. On the other hand, Jympson Harman of the London Evening News wrote: “Science-fiction hokum can be convincing, exciting or just plain laughable. Quatermass II [...] fails on all these scores, I am afraid”. Similarly, the reviewer in the Daily Herald felt “The whole thing is daft and full of stilted dialogue. [...] At the end a detective says: “How am I going to make a report on all this?” I felt the same way”.|$|E

Ryan Hadfield of Consequence of Sound labelled [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] as an [...] "essential track" [...] of Looking 4 Myself and stated that, alongside [...] "What Happened to U", the song displays the same [...] "vocal prowess" [...] {{as the rest of the}} album, but is matched with [...] "beats of higher sophistication which avers his earnest attempt to deviate from a traditional blend of R and hip-hop". According to Verse of SoulCulture [...] "'Sins Of My Father', with its reggae vibe meets Marvin Gaye or Curtis Mayfield sensibilities addressing family issues this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> track we need to hear more of from our artists." ...|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs {{was more}} negative, giving the episode a C− rating and criticizing the two plots {{and the lack}} of good jokes. He wrote that while there was [...] "some comic potential" [...] in the premise, the writers failed to deliver funny material. Commenting on the plot with Homer and Roz, Childs {{explained}} that [...] "there’s some comic possibility and resonance in having Homer stabbed in the back at work. Many people have been stabbed in the back by an ambitious colleague. Unfortunately, Homer {{may not be the best}} character to give this sort of storyline a heart. Homer is a bad employee who deserves to be ratted out by his subordinate. The fact that she is selfish and mean doesn’t add to this story. Yes, that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> person who would stab someone in the back for their own gain, but yes, Homer also had it coming. Where is the joke?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{primarily}} criticized for its short length. IGN's Hilary Goldstein {{stated that the}} game offers [...] "no reason to come back" [...] once you've completed all the puzzles. However, others compared Braids short experience to similar criticisms with Portal in that its length [...] "can be disregarded {{in the face of}} its unique approach to storytelling and expansive ideas". The game's price was also seen as a negative for the game, though McShea wrote that [...] "Braid is worth every penny". Blow later said that he expected the price to be , but Microsoft, in promoting the game as part of its Summer of Arcade, made the price $15. Edge also noted that while Blow had tried to integrate the story and gameplay throughout the game, this only worked well in the final world, and otherwise the story was [...] "a little trite in its self-conscious obscurity". However, others—including new media academics—have disagreed, praising the philosophical complexity of the game, saying [...] "Jonathan Blow's Braid <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> ontological labyrinth that Jorge Luis Borges might have made. Embedded in the simple gameplay design are genuinely huge concepts." ...|$|E
500|$|Particularly-negative reviews {{included}} that of The New York Times Elvis Mitchell, {{who said}} the film was [...] "second-rate and ordinary," [...] while Variety's Todd McCarthy considered it [...] "a pretender {{in the realm of}} bona-fide superheroes." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman gave the film a [...] "C-", criticizing the story as [...] "sloppy" [...] and [...] "slipshod", saying, [...] "Daredevil <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> half-assed, visually-lackadaisical potboiler that makes you rue the day that comic-book franchises ever took over Hollywood." [...] Time Outs Trevor Johnston praised Ben Affleck, feeling he [...] "persuades us of the pain of sightlessness and supersensitive hearing," [...] but also felt writer/director Johnson's construction fails all involved in the film. Slates David Edelstein believed Johnson copied a lot of Batman, and concluded by saying [...] "that's not so bad: The movie looks best when it looks like other, better movies." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Michael Wilmington thought the film grabs the attention, but felt it does not reward it. The New York Posts Lou Lumenick panned the film, describing it as a [...] "mind-numbing, would-be comic-book franchise, which often seems as blind as its hero -- not to mention deaf and dumb." [...] Character co-creator Stan Lee himself felt, [...] "hey just wrote the whole thing wrong. They made him too tragic." [...] Ben Affleck won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor for his work in the movie, as well as for Gigli and Paycheck.|$|E

500|$|Reception of {{the episode}} by {{television}} critics has been generally positive. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club praised the episode, gave a A- and commented that it is [...] "good to see The Simpsons try an ambitious episode, and great to see those ambitions largely fulfilled." [...] He added that episodes that [...] "give Bart extra depth ('Bart Sells His Soul' especially) are among my favorite Simpsons half-hours," [...] and noted that this episode features [...] "a side of Bart that we rarely see: someone living outside the moment. Imagining himself on his deathbed and thinking of how his whole life outside of the cruise was wasted <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> device typically reserved for the Simpson women, particularly Lisa." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that in the episode there [...] "are elements that will be familiar – it's another episode where a Simpson family vacation verges on disaster – but the main emotional storyline involving Bart is one The Simpsons hasn't touched on before, as a fantastic luxury cruise makes him uneasy {{about the state of}} the rest of his life." [...] Sepinwall concluded that he is [...] "always a fan of single-story Simpsons episodes, as well as ones built around an emotional issue facing a member of the family, and this has both – in addition to being funny and sweet and clever in its depiction of the Best Cruise Ever." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Cherokee Rose" [...] {{attained}} favorable {{reviews from}} television critics. Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, {{and felt that}} it gave an accurate depiction of the characters. He opined: [...] "I {{had a problem with}} the show's tendency to wander into cul-de-sacs in the first season, mainly because so much of it felt redundant, the work of writers who had no real idea how to construct narrative television. But this season, I'm starting to think they're getting a handle on things, and [...] "Cherokee Rose" [...] <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> episode I'd like to see more off [...] as The Walking Dead continues." [...] Paste Josh Jackson asserted that the episode was superior to preceding installments, describing it as [...] "simply a catch of breath." [...] Similarly, Josh Wigler of MTV evaluated that despite less violence than usual, the quality of [...] "Cherokee Rose" [...] improved from the previous episode. HitFix's Alan Sepinwall echoed analogous sentiments, and argued that while the show's character still need more development, the development displayed in the episode was a [...] "definite {{step in the right direction}} on that front." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings concluded that the episode contained many powerful scenes. Eric Goldman of IGN was critical of the episode, ultimately giving it a seven out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "good" [...] rating. Goldman felt that [...] "Cherokee Rose" [...] was a disappointment, citing that it lack any focus or direction. Henry Hanks, writing for CNN, said that the episode was the weakest of the season.|$|E
500|$|Steven Rosen of The Denver Post wrote [...] "DreamWorks Pictures again proves a name {{to trust}} for imaginative, funny {{animated}} movies that delight kids and adults equally." [...] Susan Stark of The Detroit News gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Swift, sweet, irreverent, rangy and as spirited in the writing and voice work as it is splendid in design." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "A fat green ogre with a grouchy disposition and worse manners, Shrek <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> unlikely hero that nobody could love -- except just about everyone who sees this hip and hilarious animated delight." [...] Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "The brilliance of the voice work, script, direction and animation all serve to make Shrek an adorable, infectious work of true sophistication." [...] Rene Rodriguez gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, calling it [...] "a gleefully fractured fairy tale that never becomes cynical or crass". Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "Beating up on the irritatingly dainty Disney trademarks is nothing new; it's just that it has rarely been done with the demolition-derby zest of Shrek." [...] William Steig, the author of the original book, and his wife Jeanne Steig also enjoyed the film, stating [...] "We all went sort of expecting to hate it, thinking, 'What has Hollywood done to it?' But we loved it. We were afraid it would be too sickeningly cute and, instead, Bill just thought they did a wonderful, witty job of it." ...|$|E
