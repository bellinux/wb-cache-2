5|$|Analogous to its lighter congeners, the nonbonding {{electrons}} on unbiunium in UbuF {{are expected}} to be able to bond to extra atoms or groups, resulting {{in the formation of the}} unbiunium trihalides UbuX3, continuing the trends of existence of ScX3, YX3, LaX3, and AcX3. Hence, the main oxidation state of unbiunium in its compounds should be +3, although the closeness of the valence subshells' energy levels may permit higher oxidation states, just like in elements 119 and 120. The standard <b>electrode</b> <b>potential</b> for the Ubu3+/Ubu couple is predicted as −2.1V.|$|E

5000|$|Since the <b>electrode</b> <b>potentials</b> are {{conventionally}} {{defined as}} reduction potentials, {{the sign of}} the potential for the metal electrode being oxidized must be reversed when calculating the overall cell potential. Note that the <b>electrode</b> <b>potentials</b> are independent of the number of electrons transferred [...] - they are expressed in volts, which measure energy per electron transferred - and so the two <b>electrode</b> <b>potentials</b> can be simply combined to give the overall cell potential even if different numbers of electrons are involved in the two electrode reactions.|$|R
5|$|Late in the 20th century, lithium {{became an}} {{important}} component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high <b>electrode</b> <b>potential.</b> Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells. Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a high energy density, {{should not be confused with}} lithium batteries, which are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode. Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} speculated that the 7s {{electrons}} are relativistically stabilized, so that in reducing conditions, only the 7p1/2 or 6d electron would be ionized, leading to the monovalent Lr+ ion. However, all experiments to reduce Lr3+ to Lr2+ or Lr+ in aqueous solution were unsuccessful, similarly to lutetium. On the basis of this, the standard <b>electrode</b> <b>potential</b> of the E°(Lr3+→Lr+) couple was calculated {{to be less than}} −1.56V, indicating that the existence of Lr+ ions in aqueous solution was unlikely. The upper limit for the E°(Lr3+→Lr2+) couple was predicted to be −0.44V: the values for E°(Lr3+→Lr) and E°(Lr4+→Lr3+) are predicted to be −2.06V and +7.9V. The stability of the group oxidation state in the 6d transition series decreases as RfIV > DbV > SgVI, and lawrencium continues the trend with LrIII being more stable than RfIV.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} <b>electrode</b> <b>potential</b> for the Sr2+/Sr {{couple is}} −2.89V, approximately midway between {{those of the}} Ca2+/Ca (−2.84V) and Ba2+/Ba (−2.92V) couples, and close {{to those of the}} neighboring alkali metals. Strontium is intermediate between calcium and barium in its reactivity toward water, with which it reacts on contact to produce strontium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Strontium metal burns in air to produce both strontium oxide and strontium nitride, but since it does not react with nitrogen below 380°C, at room temperature, it forms only the oxide spontaneously. Besides the simple oxide SrO, the peroxide SrO2 can be made by direct oxidation of strontium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Sr(O2)2. Strontium hydroxide, Sr(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of strontium are known.|$|E

25|$|The SHE {{electrode}} can {{be connected}} to any other electrode by a salt bridge to form a cell. If the second electrode is also at standard conditions, then the measured cell potential is called the standard <b>electrode</b> <b>potential</b> for the electrode.

The polarity of the standard <b>electrode</b> <b>potential</b> provides information about the relative reduction potential of the electrode compared to the SHE. If the electrode has a positive potential {{with respect to the}} SHE, then that means it is a strongly reducing electrode which forces the SHE to be the anode (an example is Cu in aqueous CuSO4 with a standard <b>electrode</b> <b>potential</b> of 0.337 V).

With a uniform potential, the driving force for the corrosion reaction is halted.

25|$|Radium, like barium, is {{a highly}} {{reactive}} metal and always exhibits its group oxidation state of +2. It forms the colorless Ra2+ cation in aqueous solution, which is highly basic and does not form complexes readily. Most radium compounds are therefore simple ionic compounds, though participation from the 6s and 6p electrons (in addition to the valence 7s electrons) is expected due to relativistic effects and would enhance the covalent character of radium compounds such as RaF2 and RaAt2. For this reason, the standard <b>electrode</b> <b>potential</b> for the half-reaction Ra2+ (aq) + 2e− → Ra (s) is −2.916V, even slightly lower than the value −2.92V for barium, whereas the values had previously smoothly increased down the group (Ca: −2.84V; Sr: −2.89V; Ba: −2.92V). The values for barium and radium are {{almost exactly the same}} as those of the heavier alkali metals potassium, rubidium, and caesium.|$|E

Flerovium(II) sulfate (FlSO4) and sulfide (FlS) should be very insoluble in water, and flerovium(II) acetate (FlC2H3O2) and nitrate (Fl(NO3)2) should be quite water-soluble. The standard <b>electrode</b> <b>potential</b> for the reduction of Fl2+ ions to metallic flerovium is estimated to be around +0.9V, confirming the increased stability of flerovium in the neutral state.

500|$|Nihonium is {{the first}} member of the 7p series of {{elements}} and the heaviest group 13 element on the periodic table, below boron, aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium. It is predicted to show many differences from its lighter homologues: a largely contributing effect is the spin–orbit (SO) interaction. It is especially strong for the superheavy elements, because their electrons move much faster than in lighter atoms, at velocities comparable to the speed of light. In relation to nihonium atoms, it lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels (stabilizing the corresponding electrons), but two of the 7p electron energy levels are stabilized more than the other four. The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the inert pair effect, and the effect [...] "tearing" [...] the 7p subshell into the more stabilized and the less stabilized parts is called the subshell splitting. Computation chemists see the split as a change of the second (azimuthal) quantum number l from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more stabilized and less stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. For many theoretical purposes, the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as 7s27p1/21. These effects stabilize lower oxidation states: the first ionization energy of nihonium is expected to be 7.306eV, the highest in group 13. Hence, the most stable oxidation state of nihonium is predicted to be the +1 state, and nihonium is expected to be less reactive than thallium. Differences for other electron levels also exist. For example, the 6d electron levels (also split in halves, with four being 6d3/2 and six being 6d5/2) are both raised, so that they are close in energy to the 7s ones. Thus, the 6d electron levels, being destabilized, should still be able to participate in chemical reactions in nihonium (as well as in the next 7p element, flerovium), thus making it behave in some ways like transition metals and allow higher oxidation states. Nihonium should hence also be able to show stable +3 and possibly also +5 oxidation states. However, the +3 state should still be less stable than the +1 state, following periodic trends. Nihonium should be the most electronegative among all the group 13 elements: for example, in the compound NhTs, the negative charge is expected to be on the nihonium atom rather than the tennessine atom, the opposite of what would be expected from simple periodicity. The electron affinity of nihonium is calculated to be around 0.68eV; in comparison, that of thallium is 0.4eV. The high electron affinity and electronegativity of nihonium are due to it being only one electron short of the closed-shell valence electron configuration of flerovium (7s27p1/22): this would make the −1 oxidation state of nihonium more stable than that of its lighter congener thallium.
