Reimbursement amounts for transporting and caring for prisoners were capped to prevent inflation of costs by local law enforcement. Salaries of state officials were reduced by 20 percent. The state property tax was also increased from 40 to 45 cents per $100 of taxable property, and laws were strengthened to facilitate the collection of delinquent taxes.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two types}} of cells in cardiac muscle: muscle cells which have the ability to {{contract}} easily, and pacemaker cells of the conducting system. The muscle cells make up the bulk (99%) of cells in the atria and ventricles. These contractile cells are connected by intercalated discs which allow a rapid response to impulses of action potential from the pacemaker cells. The intercalated discs allow the cells to act as a syncytium and enable the contractions that pump blood through the heart and into the major arteries. The pacemaker cells make up 1% of cells and form the conduction system of the heart. They are generally much smaller than the contractile cells and have few myofibrils which gives them limited contractibility. Their function is similar in many respects to neurons. Cardiac muscle tissue has autorhythmicity, the unique ability to initiate a cardiac action potential at a <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> – spreading the impulse rapidly from cell to cell to trigger the contraction of the entire heart.|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{was first}} {{observed}} to be radioactive in 1898, by the German chemist Gerhard Carl Schmidt and later that year, independently, by the Polish-French physicist Marie Curie. It {{was the second}} element that {{was found to be}} radioactive, after the 1896 discovery of radioactivity in uranium by French physicist Henri Becquerel. Between 1900 and 1903, British physicists Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy showed how thorium decayed at a <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> over time into a series of other elements. This observation led to the identification of the half-life as one of the outcomes of the alpha particle experiments that led to their disintegration theory of radioactivity. The biological effect of radiation was discovered in 1903. The newly discovered phenomenon of radioactivity excited scientists and the general public alike. In the 1920s, thorium's radioactivity was promoted as a cure for rheumatism, diabetes, and sexual impotence. In 1932, most of these uses were banned in the United States after a federal investigation into the health effects of radioactivity. Public interest in radioactivity had declined {{by the end of the}} 1930s.|$|E
5|$|However, {{conscription}} was not {{in practice}} universal. Firstly, a land-based levy meant recruits were exclusively the sons of peasants, as opposed to townspeople. Thus some 20% of the empire's population was excluded. In addition, as during the Principate, slaves were not admissible. Nor were freedmen and persons in certain occupations such as bakers and innkeepers. In addition, provincial officials and curiales (city council members) could not enlist. These rules were relaxed only in emergencies, as during the military crisis of 405–6 (Radagaisus' invasion of Italy and the great barbarian invasion of Gaul). Most importantly, the conscription requirement was often commuted into a cash levy, at a <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> per recruit due. This was done for certain provinces, in certain years, although the specific details are largely unknown. It appears from the very slim available evidence that conscription was not applied evenly across provinces but concentrated heavily in the army's traditional recruiting areas of Gaul (including the two Germaniae provinces along the Rhine) and the Danubian provinces, with other regions presumably often commuted. An analysis of the known origins of comitatenses in the period 350–476 shows that in the Western army, the Illyricum and Gaul dioceses together provided 52% of total recruits. Overall, the Danubian regions provided {{nearly half of the}} whole army's recruits, despite containing only three of the 12 dioceses. This picture is much in line with the 2nd-century position.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the puzzle of}} regime-dependent volatility in foreign exchange. We extend the literature in two ways. First, our microstructural model provides a qualitatively new explanation for the puzzle. Second, we test implications of our model using Europe's recent shift to rigidly <b>fixed</b> <b>rates</b> (EMS to EMU). In the model, shocks to order flow induce volatility under flexible rates because they have portfolio-balance effects on price, whereas under <b>fixed</b> <b>rates</b> the same shocks do not have portfolio-balance effects. These effects arise in one regime {{and not the other}} because the elasticity of speculative demand for foreign exchange is (endogenously) regime-dependent: low elasticity under flexible rates magnifies portfolio-balance effects; under credibly <b>fixed</b> <b>rates,</b> elasticity of speculative demand is infinite, eliminating portfolio-balance effects. New data on FF/DM transactions show that order flow had persistent effects on the exchange rate before EMU parities were announced. After announcement, determination of the FF/DM rate was decoupled from order flow, as predicted by the model...|$|R

40|$|The global {{positioning}} system (GPS) is increasingly being used to monitor animal movement and to develop more sustainable land management practices. Reliable and accurate GPS data are required to develop robust animal resource selection functions (RSFs). This study used Earth Centred Earth Fixed (ECEF) high <b>fix</b> <b>rate</b> (4 Hz) GPS data collected from Fleck™ 2 GPS collars fitted to six cows over a four-day period. The GPS data were used to derive speed and mean speed histograms. Maximum mean speed values were used to model the maximum distance travelled {{for a range of}} sample intervals. Maximum distance travelled was used to estimate the minimum area that could be predicted. To extend the methods further, we explored the use of probability density functions to describe the speed profiles; a Gamma probability density function (PDF) was shown to provide the best description. By modelling animal speeds using both the raw data and the PDF, it was possible to estimate the minimum area occupied for varying GPS sample frequencies and patch areas. Overall, the cows spent the greatest proportion (77 %) of their time either stationary or moving very slowly (less than 0. 2 m s− 1). Despite the slow speeds, the prediction errors were around 90 % for sample frequencies of greater than half an hour and a patch area of 100 m 2. If study patch areas are between 10 and 100 m 2 the GPS <b>fix</b> <b>rate</b> would need to be less than 10 s.
