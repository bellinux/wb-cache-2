50|$|Chin-up {{bars are}} {{playground}} equipment {{that were once}} ubiquitous on children's playgrounds. They are still important in the adult equivalent of a playground, the Par course. A chin-up bar is simply a smooth <b>horizontal</b> <b>metal</b> <b>bar,</b> often a pipe, held solidly above ground by a wooden or metal frame. Typical installations include 2 or 3 different heights of bars for people of different heights. Chin up bars are {{also a part of}} a home gym setup. Types of chin-up bars include doorway-mounted, wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted and free-standing.|$|E

Table football tables can vary in size, but a typical table is about 120 cm (4 ft) long and 61 cm (2 ft) wide.

The older infant had partly slipped through the front and was suspended with his head and arms within the stroller-pram and with his face pushed firmly into the mattress by a <b>horizontal</b> <b>metal</b> <b>bar.</b> Stroller-prams are a potentially dangerous sleeping environment unless infants are closely supervised gaps {{in the front of}} stroller-prams closed and upright footplates stabilised.

40|$|Atypical neuroleptics produce fewer {{extrapyramidal}} side-effects (EPS) than typical neuroleptics. The pharmacological {{profile of}} atypical neuroleptics {{is that they}} have equivalent or higher antagonist affinity for 5 -HT 2 than for dopamine D 2 receptors. Our aim was to identify which 5 -HT 2 receptor contributed to the atypical profile. Catalepsy was defined as rats remaining immobile over a <b>horizontal</b> <b>metal</b> <b>bar</b> for at least 30 [*]s, 90 [*]min after dosing. Radioligand binding assays were carried out with homogenates of human recombinant 5 -HT 2 A, 5 -HT 2 B and 5 -HT 2 C receptors expressed in Human Embryo Kidney (HEK 293) cells. Haloperidol (1. 13 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. p.) induced catalepsy in all experiments. The selective 5 -HT 2 C/ 2 B receptor antagonist, SB- 228357 (0. 32 – 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 p. o.) significantly reversed haloperidol-induced catalepsy whereas the 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 2 B receptor antagonists, MDL- 100907 (0. 003 – 0. 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 p. o.) and SB- 215505 (0. 1 – 3. 2 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 p. o.) respectively did not reverse haloperidol-induced catalepsy. The data suggest a role for 5 -HT 2 C receptors in the anticataleptic action of SB- 228357...|$|E

The target areas of the men are the centre top, and upper left and right sides for cutting strikes and the centre of the throat protector for a thrust.|$|R
40|$|Source of support: Departmental sources Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of agomelatine in a psychosis-relevant behavior model. Material/Methods: We used 18 adult male Wistar rats in this study. Twelve rats given LPS for endotoxemia were randomly divided into 2 groups (n= 6). Group I was treated with 1 mL/kg 0. 9 % NaCl i. p. and Group II was treated with 40 mg/kg agomelatine. Six normal rats served as the control group and were not given LPS for endotoxemia. Cylindrical steel cages containing vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>metal</b> <b>bars</b> with top cover were used. Rats were put in these cag-es for the purpose of orientation for 10 min. Apomorphine was given to rats removed from cages, and then they were immediately put back in the cages for the purpose of observing stereotyped conduct. Brain HVA lev-els and plasma TNF-a levels were evaluated in tissue homogenates using ELISA. The proportion of malondial-dehyde (MDA) was measured in samples taken from plasma for detection of lipid peroxidation similar to thio-barbituric acid reactive substances. Results: LPS induced-plasma TNF-a, brain TNF-a, and plasma MDA levels were significantly lower in the LPS+agomelatine group compared to the LPS+saline group (p< 0. 05). HVA levels and stereotype scores were significantly lower in the LPS+agomelatine group compared to the LPS+saline group (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Agomelatine reduced TNF-a, HVA, MDA levels, and the stereotype score in relevant models of psychosis. Ou...|$|R
40|$|Observations of piglet play {{behaviour}} {{were recorded}} on real time video over 28 days during six periods for 6 h per period per litter (days 1 - 5, 6 - 10, 11 - 15, 16 - 20, 21 - 25, 26 - 30), from birth, in three farrowing environments: (i) an adjustable parallel crate (800 mm width) in a 2130 mm x 2105 mm pen; (ii) a round crate (1. 85 mm diameter) within a pen (2130 mm x 2105 mm); (iii) a pen (2130 mm x 2105 mm) surrounded {{on the inside}} by <b>horizontal</b> <b>metal</b> <b>bars</b> 200 mm above the floor. Eight sows and their litters were observed in each environment. Individual play was recorded as spring (sudden jumping or leaping, 9. 6 % of observations of play frequency, highest in the round crate), run (8. 3 % of play, no pen differences) and object play (18. 8 % of play, highest in the parallel crate). These behaviours all began at 3 - 5 days of age, and peaked at 21 - 25 days. Social play, which involved nudging or pushing other animals also began at 3 - 5 days. Nudging contributed 12. 3 % of observations of play, this behaviour occurring more frequently in the open pen, while pushing comprised 17. 1 % of play observations and was greatest in the parallel crate. Play with sow began on days 1 - 2 with piglets climbing, nudging, or biting the sow. This accounted for 22. 6 % of observations of play and occurred at higher levels in the round crate and open pen than in the parallel crate. Naso-naso contact of piglets with the sow also began early (days 1 - 2) and averaged 11. 0 % of play observations with a higher frequency in the parallel crate. The end to a social play episode was usually separation as piglets ceased their activity and walked away (average 72. 2 % of observations of play endings). Aggression, where the play developed into a fight, accounted for 27. 8 % of endings in the parallel crate, only 12. 5 % in the open pen and 13. 4 % in the round crate. Rest, where the piglets lay down after play, accounted for an average 9. 7 % of observations of play endings and was much higher in the parallel crate. This study shows that play behaviour develops rapidly in an intensive farrowing environment, which may indicate that piglet welfare is not compromised...|$|R

40|$|Transorbital brain {{injuries}} caused by <b>metal</b> <b>bar</b> penetration are uncommon and often cause serious damage without prompt treatment. Artifacts {{caused by the}} penetrating <b>metal</b> <b>bar</b> on computed tomography (CT) often obscure the actual brain damage along the path of penetration, and delayed treatment for the brain insult may result. We present 2 cases of transorbital brain injury following penetration by a <b>metal</b> <b>bar.</b> CT scans were initially performed on both patients. However, image resolution was poor {{and the extent of}} brain damage could not be ascertained due to severe artifacts associated with the <b>metal</b> <b>bars.</b> Both patients deteriorated in the emergency room and subsequently received surgical intervention. One patient recovered uneventfully. Unfortunately, the other patient died following surgery due to an unrecognized intracranial hemorrhage with brain herniation.
