5|$|The Indonesian {{occupation}} of <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> began in December 1975 and lasted until October 1999. After centuries of Portuguese colonial rule in <b>East</b> <b>Timor,</b> a 1974 coup in Portugal {{led to the}} decolonisation of its former colonies, creating instability in <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> and leaving its future uncertain. After a small-scale civil war, the pro-independence Fretilin declared victory {{in the capital city}} of Dili and declared an independent <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> on 28 November 1975.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Transitional Administration in <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> (UNTAET) was {{established}} {{at the end of}} October and administered the region for two years. Control of the nation was turned over to the Government of <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> and independence was declared on 20 May 2002. On 27 September of the same year, <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> joined the United Nations as its 191st member state.|$|E

5|$|According to Fretilin, {{this effort}} yielded assurances from twenty-five countries—including the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, Mozambique, Sweden, and Cuba—to {{recognise}} the new nation. Cuba currently shares close relations with <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> today. On 28 November 1975, Fretilin unilaterally declared independence for the Democratic Republic of <b>East</b> <b>Timor.</b> Indonesia announced, UDT and APODETI leaders {{in and around}} Balibó would respond the next day by declaring that region independent from <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> and officially part of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} {{increase in}} international attention to self-determination {{and human rights}} put further pressure on Indonesia. Subsequent events within <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> in the 1990s helped to dramatically raise the international profile of <b>East</b> <b>Timor,</b> which in turn significantly boosted {{the momentum of the}} resistance groups.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1974 Carnation Revolution, Portugal began {{a process}} of decolonisation and began a {{withdrawal}} from Portuguese Timor (later <b>East</b> <b>Timor).</b> Australians had long taken {{an interest in the}} colony; the nation had sent troops to the region during World War II, and many East Timorese had fought the Japanese as guerrillas. In September 1974, Whitlam met with President Suharto in Indonesia and indicated that he would support Indonesia if it annexed <b>East</b> <b>Timor.</b> At the height of the Cold War, and {{in the context of the}} American retreat from Indo-China, he felt that incorporation of <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> into Indonesia would enhance the stability of the region, and reduce the risk of the East Timorese FRETILIN movement, which many feared was communist, coming to power.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} invasion, the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council passed resolutions condemning Indonesia's actions in <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> {{and calling for}} its {{immediate}} withdrawal from the territory.

40|$|The {{account of}} the events {{surrounding}} <b>East</b> <b>Timor’s</b> liberation from Indonesia by News Limited journalists Don Greenlees and Robert Garran is subtitled ‘The inside story of <b>East</b> <b>Timor’s</b> fight for freedom’. Dealing as it does primarily with the diplomatic machinations of the Indonesian and Australian governments in that period, {{it would be fair}} to say the subtitle should read ‘The inside story of those who worked against <b>East</b> <b>Timor’s</b> fight for freedom’. By detailing the story of <b>East</b> <b>Timor’s</b> transition to independence from the perspective of Jakarta and Canberra, the two reporters run dangerously close to echoing the perceptions of these two governments. The book reads in some parts like press releases from, alternately, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and the Indonesian state newsagency, Antara. A well-placed former Australian army officer remarked to me that, after reading the book, he came away ‘almost feeling sorry for the TNI [Indonesian Army]’...|$|R

5|$|The 2nd Commando Regiment, {{then known}} as 4 RAR (Cdo), was {{deployed}} {{as a part of}} the United Nations Transitional Administration in <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> (UNTAET) in 2001. When notified to replace 1 RAR in <b>East</b> <b>Timor,</b> 4 RAR had not long previously been raised as a commando battalion, developing special forces capabilities to supplement those of the SASR. With the commitment to <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> continuing, however, 4 RAR was re-roled as a light infantry battalion for deployment to <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> as AUSBATT IV. This involved reorganising from the existing two commando-companies structure to a light infantry battalion with four companies and a growth in the unit from 220 to 670 personnel. This saw B and C Company remain commando-qualified. A Company was formed in June 2000 followed by D Company in November both filled with Regular infantry soldiers posted in to the unit. The battalion took official control over Area of Operations (AO) Matilda in the northern border region on 25 April under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Sengelman.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{first arrived}} in Timor in the 16th century, and in 1702 <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> came under Portuguese colonial administration. Portuguese rule was tenuous until the island was divided with the Dutch Empire in 1860. A {{significant}} battleground during the Pacific War, <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> was occupied by 20,000 Japanese troops. The fighting helped prevent a Japanese occupation of Australia, but resulted in 60,000 East Timorese deaths.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{language}} was banned in <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> and Indonesian was made {{the language of}} government, education and public commerce, and the Indonesian school curriculum was implemented.

5|$|The testimonies {{of foreigners}} at the {{cemetery}} were quickly reported to international news organisations, and video footage of the massacre was widely broadcast internationally causing outrage. In response to the massacre, activists around the world organised in solidarity with the East Timorese, and a new urgency was brought to calls for self-determination. TAPOL, a British organisation formed in 1973 to advocate for democracy in Indonesia, increased its work around <b>East</b> <b>Timor.</b> In the United States, the <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> Action Network (now the <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> and Indonesia Action Network) was founded and soon had chapters in ten cities around the country. Other solidarity groups appeared in Portugal, Australia, Japan, Germany, Malaysia, Ireland, and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The vote, to be {{administered}} by the United Nations Mission in <b>East</b> <b>Timor</b> (UNAMET), was originally scheduled for 8 August but later postponed until 30 August. Indonesia also took responsibility for security; this arrangement caused worry in <b>East</b> <b>Timor,</b> but many observers believe that Indonesia would have refused to allow foreign peacekeepers during the vote.|$|E

5|$|Tensions {{between the}} F-FDTL and PNTL have also reduced the {{effectiveness}} of <b>East</b> <b>Timor's</b> security services. During 2003 and 2004, members of the police and F-FDTL clashed {{on a number of}} occasions, and groups of soldiers attacked police stations in September 2003 and December 2004. These tensions were caused by the overlapping roles of the two security services, differences of opinion between members of <b>East</b> <b>Timor's</b> leadership and the fact that many members of the PNTL had served with the Indonesian National Police prior to <b>East</b> <b>Timor's</b> independence while the F-FDTL was based around FALINTIL. In 2003, the East Timorese Government established three new paramilitary police forces equipped with modern weapons. The formation of these units led to dissatisfaction with the Government among some members of the F-FDTL.|$|R
