5|$|Armillaria gallica may {{itself be}} parasitized by other soil flora. Several {{species of the}} fungus Trichoderma, {{including}} Trichoderma polysporum, T.harzianum and T.viride, are able to attack and penetrate and the outer tissue of A.gallica rhizomorphs and parasitize the internal hyphae. The infected rhizomorphs become devoid of living hyphae about {{one week after the}} initial infection. Entoloma abortivum is another fungus that can live parasitically upon A.gallica. The whitish-gray malformed fruit bodies that may result are due to the E.abortivum hyphae penetrating the mushroom and disrupting <b>its</b> <b>normal</b> development.|$|E

The investigation revealed that Armstrong was a plumber who was bidding {{on behalf of his}} brother-in-law, a former prison official in the Stanley administration.

5|$|For {{the first}} time all four Canadian {{divisions}} were assembled to participate in a battle. The nature and size of the planned Canadian Corps assault necessitated support and resources beyond <b>its</b> <b>normal</b> operational capabilities. Consequently, the British 5th Infantry Division and supplementary artillery, engineer and labour units reinforced the four Canadian divisions. This brought the nominal strength of the Canadian Corps to about 170,000 men, of whom 97,184 were Canadian.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In a Boolean algebra, {{every element}} has two {{canonical}} forms, <b>its</b> disjunctive <b>normal</b> form (BDNF) and <b>its</b> conjunctive <b>normal</b> form (BCNF). If these elements are {{viewed in the}} algebra consisting of the unit interval with operations min, max, and the usual negation, the inequality BDNF BCNF always holds. If the operations min and max in this algebra are replaced by a t-norm and its t-conorm dual to the usual negation, the resulting inequality holds sometimes and fails sometimes. This paper examines this phenomenon, expecially in the two variable case, which has been of interest to Turksen. Index Terms — Inequality, t-norm, normal form I...|$|R

This happened in 1863 and 1888, and a major irruption took place in 1908 when many birds were seen as far afield as Ireland and the United Kingdom where they bred in Yorkshire and Moray.|$|E
