5|$|The botched arrest {{attempt was}} {{politically}} disastrous for Charles. No English sovereign had ever entered the House of Commons, and his unprecedented {{invasion of the}} chamber to arrest its members was considered a <b>grave</b> <b>breach</b> of parliamentary privilege. In one stroke Charles destroyed his supporters' efforts to portray him as a defence against innovation and disorder.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin {{blocked the}} speech, {{saying that it}} would shock many people and would be a <b>grave</b> <b>breach</b> of {{constitutional}} principles. By modern convention, the sovereign could only act with the advice and counsel of ministers. In seeking the people's support against the government, Edward was opting to oppose binding ministerial advice and instead act as a private individual. Edward's British ministers felt that, in proposing the speech, Edward had revealed his disdainful attitude towards constitutional conventions and threatened the political neutrality of the Crown.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{disputes}} whether, {{and if so}} to what extent, it is an {{occupying power}} {{in relation to the}} Palestinian territories and as to whether Israeli settlements in these territories are in breach of Israel's obligations as an occupying power and constitute a <b>grave</b> <b>breach</b> of the Geneva Conventions and whether the settlements constitute war crimes. In 2015, over 800,000 Israelis resided over the 1949 Armistice Lines, constituting nearly 13% of Israel's Jewish population.|$|E
40|$|<b>Grave</b> <b>breaches</b> of the Geneva Conventions are {{one type}} of war crime. In this Article, I argue that the <b>grave</b> <b>breaches</b> regime has three {{possible}} futures. In the first, the regime remains segregated from other categories of war crimes in deference to {{the historical development of}} these crimes. This future, however, is one that will see a relatively dramatic decline in the use of <b>grave</b> <b>breaches</b> in practice, primarily because other offences cover the same acts more efficiently. In the second possible future, the <b>grave</b> <b>breaches</b> are entirely abandoned, but this eventuality seems both improbable and undesirable. Even though judicial pragmatism has diminished aspects of the <b>grave</b> <b>breaches</b> regime that were once unique, <b>grave</b> <b>breaches</b> still offer important features over and above all alternatives. The <b>grave</b> <b>breaches</b> regime is therefore unlikely to disappear entirely. A third possible future involves assimilating the <b>grave</b> <b>breaches</b> with other categories of war crimes, ideally through the promulgation of a more coherent treaty regime. In the short term, this proposition appears politically untenable, leaving judges to unify the stark disparities between <b>grave</b> <b>breaches</b> and other war crimes. A future that continues to adopt this course will nonetheless pose serious problems for the discipline in the years to come. Over the longer term, a treaty creating a more comprehensive code governing all war crimes is therefore inevitable...|$|R

25|$|The {{international}} community has formally entrusted the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) {{with the role of}} guardian of international humanitarian law. That includes a watchdog function by which it takes direct action to encourage parties to armed conflict to comply with international humanitarian law. The head of the International Red Cross delegation to Israel and the Occupied Territories stated that the establishment of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories is a <b>grave</b> <b>breach</b> of the Geneva Conventions that constitute war crime.|$|E
25|$|Muwalo was {{expelled}} from his posts of MCP Secretary General and Minister without Portfolio on 27 October 1976. The announcement gave the reason as a <b>grave</b> <b>breach</b> of discipline and stated that Muwalo would forfeit any property gained through his governmental or party posts. His expulsion occurred shortly after that of Focus Gwede, and both men were arrested, Muwalo on 27 October and Gwede on 10 November. It was suggested that these expulsions and arrests followed {{an investigation into the}} activities of Muwalo and Gwede which found the men had misused Banda's name when abusing their powers. In particular, the two men (who were related) interfered with a police investigation involving another relative.|$|E
25|$|On May 3, 2006, Chen {{canceled}} {{plans to}} pass through the United States on his way to Latin America. He was hoping to stop by either San Francisco or New York City to refuel and stay overnight, but the US refused his request instead limiting him to a brief refuelling stopover in Anchorage, Alaska where Chen {{would not be allowed to}} step off the plane. Chen and Taiwan saw this as a snub and led to Chen's cancellation. The trip to Latin America will continue, however, without a US stopover. The US State Department claimed that the Alaska stopover offer was consistent with its previous accommodations. However, former Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui was granted a visit to Cornell University eleven years ago. More recently, in addition, Taiwan's leaders have in general been granted permission to stopover in the United States for brief periods before continuing on to other countries. This recent American stance is interpreted by Taiwan to be an expression of the increasing irritation the United States feels towards Taiwan and Chen's seemingly pro-independence gestures. Chen attended the inauguration of Óscar Arias, the president of Costa Rica, one of the few countries that recognized the Republic of China at that time. Laura Bush was also present to represent U.S. president George W. Bush. Chen seized the opportunity, approached her and shook her hands, while Chen's aide produced a camera immediately for an impromptu photo-op. Chen's supporters saw this act as a step forward in Taiwan's struggle for diplomatic recognition, while his detractors claimed that it was a <b>grave</b> <b>breach</b> of international etiquette and put Taiwan to shame.|$|E

2500|$|After {{two weeks}} of hearing {{witnesses}} and reviewing evidence, the Committee determined that the trial had been fair and a new trial was not warranted. They assessed the charges against Thayer as well. Their criticism, using words provided by Judge Grant, was direct: [...] "He ought not to have talked about the case off the bench, and doing so was a <b>grave</b> <b>breach</b> of judicial decorum." [...] But they also found some of the charges about his statements unbelievable or exaggerated, and they determined that anything he might have said had {{no impact on the}} trial. The panel's reading of the trial transcript convinced them that Thayer [...] "tried to be scrupulously fair." [...] The Committee also reported that the trial jurors were almost unanimous in praising Thayer's conduct of the trial.|$|E

[...] "Al Manar management apologized for airing the series, dropped it and explained that the Station had purchased it without first viewing the entire series."

2500|$|EY's member firm in Japan, Ernst & Young ShinNihon, {{was fined}} [...] (...) {{for failing to}} spot {{irregularities}} during audit of its client Toshiba, which was Japan's worst accounting scandal in years. The firm was also suspended from taking up new business for three months. An official from Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) described that [...] "here was a <b>grave</b> <b>breach</b> of duty". The firm's CEO and chairman, Koichi Hanabusa stepped down the following month to take responsibility and monthly salaries for 19 employees were cut from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. In an unusual move, the FSA publicly named seven accountants involved in the audit who were said of failing to exercise due caution and signing off on false financial documents. The FSA also said the [...] "firm’s operations were deeply improper". ShinNihon, at the time, was Japan's biggest accounting firm, with about 3,500 certified accountants and more than 4,000 clients. Ernst & Young ShinNihon audited about 960 listed companies in Japan, the most among the Big Four, as reported in 2015. Ernst & Young ShinNihon had audited Toshiba for over 60 years and the firm had around 70 staff serving Toshiba before the accounting scandal broke.|$|E
