5|$|Like most crows, {{they will}} {{scavenge}} at landfills, scattering garbage in the process. Where available, corn, wheat {{and other crops}} are a <b>favorite</b> <b>food.</b> These habits have historically caused the American crow {{to be considered a}} nuisance. However, it is suspected that the harm to crops is offset by the service the American crow provides by eating insect pests.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the species}} is {{primarily}} fossorial, it occasionally gathers food near the entrance of a tunnel. Dandelions seem to be its <b>favorite</b> <b>food,</b> and are also used as nesting material. During breeding season males will enter the tunnels of females, and males and females may make purring (or cooing) sounds when they are together. Mothers seem to comfort the young by softly vocalizing, with the young twittering in response.|$|E

5|$|Of {{most vital}} {{importance}} to marshes are invertebrate animals, {{the foundation of}} food webs. Amphibious invertebrates such as apple snails (Pomacea paludosa), crayfish, and grass shrimp consume plant material, hastening its decomposition and acting as a food source for fish and birds. Insect larvae use water for breeding, feeding upon smaller copepods and amphipods that live in microscopic algae and periphyton formations. Mosquitos, born in water, are in turn the <b>favorite</b> <b>food</b> of 112 species of dragonflies and 44 species of damselflies in Florida. These animals are water hardy and adaptable to dry conditions when water levels fluctuate from one season to the next or through drought and flood cycles.|$|E
5|$|Whitebark pine {{communities}} have been heavily damaged {{due to the}} effects of blister rust, a non native fungus. In Glacier and the surrounding region, 30% of the whitebark pine trees have died and over 70% of the remaining trees are currently infected. The whitebark pine provides a high fat pine cone seed, commonly known as the pine nut, that is a <b>favorite</b> <b>food</b> of red squirrels and Clark's nutcracker. Both grizzlies and black bears are known to raid squirrel caches of pine nuts, one of the bears' favorite foods. Between 1930 and 1970, efforts to control the spread of blister rust were unsuccessful, and continued destruction of whitebark pines appears likely, with attendant negative impacts on dependent species.|$|E
5|$|Bears, {{both black}} and brown, are seen in Glacier Bay in the {{intertidal}} zone which they frequent for foraging. They are also seen “scraping barnacles off of rocks and munching mussels.” Invariably they are spotted wandering alone along the beaches of the Glacier Bay in search of salmon. The habitats of the black bears are generally the southern forested areas of the bay. However, the brown bears are mostly found in the northern, more recently glaciated zones of the Glacier Bay. Occasionally, black bears are sighted near the glaciers or near Gustavus town. Black bears with black dots and brown bears with brown dots have been {{seen over the last}} 10 years. Their travel routes have been identified as along the easy tracks such as along beaches, stream beds and river valleys. The most commonly identified locations for sighting bears in the Glacier Bay are: The Bartlett Cove, the Bartlett River, the Beardslee Islands and North and South Sandy Cove locations for black bears, while brown bears are seen to the north of Tidal Inlet in the west arm of glacier and north of Adams Inlet in the east arm. They are also seen swimming in the Bay, crossing from one bank to the other. Salmon are their <b>favorite</b> <b>food,</b> apart from bumblebees, sand fleas, bird eggs, birds, voles and marine mammal carcasses.|$|E

25|$|Red {{harvester}} ants are a <b>favorite</b> <b>food</b> for desert horned lizards.

25|$|In short grass prairie {{there are}} two {{dominant}} plants, buffalo grass (Bouteloua dactyloides), is a strong and hardy grass that is the favorite of grazers. The second is blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), which is essential for soil retention. In tallgrass prairie there are four dominant species, big bluestem grass (Andropogen gerardii), Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans), switch grass (Panicum virgatum), and little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium). Big bluestem grass is 4–8 feet tall and was the <b>favorite</b> <b>food</b> of the buffalo.|$|E

He is depicted as somewhat gullible and very rash, especially when angered. He has often been tricked by Doctor Robotnik, but is stated in one game manual to have become more skeptical of him.|$|E
25|$|Chibiusa's {{dream is}} to one day become a real lady, to have her own prince, and {{to be friends with}} {{everyone}} she knows. Meanwhile, she is a fairly ordinary little girl; she likes the colour pink and red, pudding, pancakes, and rabbits. Her favorite school subject is drawing, while her least favorites are language classes. Her least <b>favorite</b> <b>food</b> is listed in the manga as carrots, just like Usagi, but they both eat them in the anime. Chibiusa hates taking care of the house and is afraid of such things as thunder and lightning, ghosts, vampires, dentists, and needles. She also likes to collect things with rabbits on them, and belongs to the Gardening Committee at school. She is very short when she first appears, but grows slightly taller as she gets older.|$|E
25|$|<b>Favorite</b> <b>food</b> plants include {{native and}} {{introduced}} species from {{all sorts of}} dicot families, such as Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Bignoniaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, Myrtaceae or Solanaceae. Magnoliidae fruit, for example of Duguetia furfuracea (Annonaceae) or avocados (Persea americana, Lauraceae) can be seasonally important. They do not usually eat cereal grains, or monocots in general. However, the leaves of particular grass species like Brachiaria brizantha can be eaten in large quantities, and Liliaceae (e.g. the sarsaparilla Smilax brasiliensis) have also been recorded as foodplants. Even tough and spiny vegetable matter like tubers or thistles is eaten with relish. Like many birds which feed on tough plant matter, the greater rhea swallows pebbles which help grind down the food for easy digestion. It is much attracted to sparkling objects and sometimes accidentally swallows metallic or glossy objects.|$|E

25|$|This is an erect or {{spreading}} cactus with narrow, long stems {{which can}} well exceed one meter in length, at times approaching five meters. It {{is covered in}} long, yellow or yellow-tipped spines which may be up to 4 centimeters long. It produces enormous tubular flowers up to 20 centimeters long which are sweet-scented and white to pinkish in color. They bloom at night. The fruit is spherical and red or orange in color, measuring up to 6 centimeters wide. The fruits are a <b>favorite</b> <b>food</b> of local birds, which likely help to disperse the seeds. The cactus has been noted to live at least 19 years, and in general has low fecundity; older, larger plants {{are more likely to}} survive, and they have higher fecundity, as well. Small plants may benefit from growing with nurse plants.|$|E
25|$|Up to 2,000 feral cats can in {{some years}} {{be found on the}} island; the {{population}} became established in the 19th century. Their depredations seriously harm the birdlife. Since the late 19th century, they have driven about 60% of the seabird species from the mainland completely, and during particular dry spells they will cross the mudflats and feast upon the birds on the motus. Spectacled tern chicks seem to be a <b>favorite</b> <b>food</b> of the local cat population. There are some measures being taken to ensure the cat population does not grow. That lowering the cat population by some amount would much benefit Christmas and its inhabitants is generally accepted, but the situation is too complex to simply go and eradicate them outright (which is theoretically possible; see Marion Island) – see below for details. A limited population of feral pigs exists. They were once plentiful and wreaked havoc especially on the Onychoprion and noddies. Pig hunting by locals has been encouraged, and was highly successful at limiting the pig population to a sustainable level, while providing a source of cheap protein for the islanders.|$|E
500|$|Kishimoto was {{satisfied}} with his character having blond hair and blue eyes, something rarely seen in Japanese anime or manga.

When asked why Naruto's <b>favorite</b> <b>food</b> was ramen instead of kitsune udon, Kishimoto said that he himself likes eating ramen.
