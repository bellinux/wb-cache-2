One important source of inefficiency of employment subsidies is non-additional employment and deadweight spending which occur when private firms receive a subsidy for jobs {{that would have been}} created without the subsidy. We identify the asymmetry of information {{between the government and the}} private firm as the source of these problems. When the government proposes optimal incentive contracts to promote employment, we show that all <b>employment</b> <b>creations</b> are additional and that the deadweight spending is equal to the information rent, which may be null when firms’ types are discrete...|$|R

We also address the gender gap by age, with similar results: a sharp decline during the last fifteen years, especially for young women. Finally, the gender gap {{in unemployment}} does not reveal a mismatch between the characteristics of job seekers (e. g. number of women or men competing for jobs, type of contracts, full or part-time work, etc.), and the structure of <b>employment</b> <b>creations,</b> which numerically favour women. ...|$|R

30|$|When {{we examine}} the {{relationship}} between the response variable B 3 and the two predictor variable B 1 and B 2 of Model (3) in Table  5, B 2 is statistically significant to the response variable B 3 only. The predictor variable B 2 has a positive (+) estimated coefficient β̂_B 2  =  2.803, Z value =  7.19 *** and exp(β̂_B 2) =  16.50. So, new <b>employment</b> performance <b>creation</b> success probability odds ratio increases 16.50 -fold when B 2 changes from the reference level B 2  =  0 to B 2  =  1. Among the five predictor variables in Model (3), B 2 has the largest values of estimated coefficient, Z value and odds ratio. Thus, new employment performance can be improved by generating sales performance in advance. However, the odds ratio exp(β̂_B 2) =  16.50 of not-for-profit institutions is much less than the odds ratio exp(β̂_B 2) =  41.79 of for-profit institutions. It indicates that the sensitivity of new <b>employment</b> performance <b>creation</b> success probability decreases in the case of not-for-profit institutions.|$|R
