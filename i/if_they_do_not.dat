Embarrassingly parallel applications are considered the easiest to parallelize.|$|E

5|$|In December 2016, when World Rugby was {{considering}} {{a change in}} the eligibility rules for international selection, FFR president Bernard Laporte announced that the body would require that all France national team members hold French passports. This requirement is in addition to then-current WR rules mandating three years' residency for international selection, a period which WR increased to five years effective from 31 December 2020. Players who represented France prior to Laporte's announcement remain eligible for selection even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> hold French passports.|$|E

By two years post-injury, 80% of men recover at least partial erectile function, though many experience problems with the reliability and duration of their erections <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> use interventions to enhance them. Studies have found that half or up to 65% of men with SCI have orgasms, although the experience may feel different than it did before the injury. Most men say it feels weaker, and takes longer and more stimulation to achieve.|$|E

All the nominations have to be delivered to the Astronomical Society of the Pacific by December 15 of the nominating year and remain valid for three years.

5|$|Before mating, {{males and}} females may stridulate, or vibrate the objects they are on. In the Meloidae, the male climbs onto the dorsum of the female and strokes his {{antennae}} on her head, palps, and antennae. In Eupompha, the male draws his antennae along his longitudinal vertex. They may not mate at all <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> perform the precopulatory ritual. This mating behaviour may be different amongst dispersed populations of the same species. For example, the mating of a Russian population of tansy beetle (Chysolina graminis) is preceded by an elaborate ritual involving the male tapping the female's eyes, pronotum and antennae with its antennae, which is not evident in the population of this species in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Hill was {{qualifying}} for a 1997 event at Sonoma when his car suffered severe vibration {{as he crossed}} the finish line. The car went out of control and was completely destroyed. Hill had two broken toes and a shoulder contusion, which were not serious injuries. The run had been fast enough to make Hill the fastest qualifier, and Hill wanted to race his backup car in the first round on the day after the accident. The NHRA had a rule that the car used for qualifying had {{to be used in the}} event, so the sanctioning body did not allow him to compete. The rule was changed after the event to allow racers to race on race day even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> use the same car.|$|E
5|$|Human Rights Watch, {{in their}} 2008 report on Saudi Arabian {{criminal}} justice system, {{noted that the}} criminal procedure code introduced in 2002 lacked some basic protections but, as mentioned above, had been ignored by judges in any case. Those arrested are often not informed {{of the crime of}} which they are accused or given access to a lawyer and are subject to abusive treatment and torture <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> confess. At trial, there is a presumption of guilt and the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense. Most trials are held in secret, that is, without the public or press. The physical punishments imposed by Saudi courts, such as beheading, stoning, amputation and lashing, and the number of executions have also been strongly criticized.|$|E
5|$|Hunters {{primarily}} {{attack the}} player by bracing themselves and firing bursts from their flechette cannon. Four flechettes can vaporize an ordinary human soldier. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> strike a living target, the flechette charge up {{for several seconds}} and then explode, dealing minor damage to everything nearby. Hunters may also conduct a charging attack or strike with their legs if the player gets too close. Hunters are vulnerable to all weapons, but to compensate, are still quite resilient, making explosives and the pulse rifle's charged energy ball the most attractive options. Objects thrown with the gravity gun are also effective, especially if the player catches some of their flechettes with the object before hurling it (one of the in-game Achievements). In outdoor environments, they can be run over with a vehicle.|$|E
