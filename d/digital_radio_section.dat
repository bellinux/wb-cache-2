40|$|A {{review of}} the {{relative}} merits of various terrestrial and satellite technologies for <b>digital</b> <b>radio</b> broadcasting services and restricted datacasting services in regional areas.   <b>Digital</b> <b>radio</b> in Australia commenced in the five mainland state capital cities — Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney—in mid- 2009. <b>Digital</b> <b>radio</b> was introduced to supplement, not replace, analog (AM and FM) radio services. It provides consumers who purchase a suitable receiver with access to additional radio services from commercial, national (ABC and SBS) broadcasters and, since early  2011, wide-coverage community radio broadcasters. Many of the receivers available also provide consumers with additional features that are not available for analog radio services. These may include improved sound quality, text on screen, a pause and rewind function, the ability to connect to the internet and dock with other devices. When the Australian Parliament passed legislation to implement the framework for the introduction of <b>digital</b> <b>radio</b> in 2007, a parliamentary committee noted that it was too early to prescribe a technology for services in regional areas. Accordingly, the legislation required that a review be undertaken by 1 January 2011 of various technologies suitable for regional <b>digital</b> <b>radio</b> services. <b>Section</b> 215 A of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (the Act) requires the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy to cause to be conducted a {{review of the}} relative merits of various terrestrial and satellite technologies for digital radio broadcasting services and restricted datacasting services in regional areas.    ...|$|R

40|$|In 2015 <b>digital</b> <b>radio</b> {{broadcasting}} {{will have}} been on air for 20 years {{in a number of}} European countries. Some observers will call for celebration, others for commemoration. Progress in rolling out <b>digital</b> <b>radio</b> in those countries, with the long term intention of switching from FM completely, has proved variable. Some countries, such as the UK and Denmark, are considered success stories, while in others such as Germany and France (the originators of the DAB <b>digital</b> <b>radio</b> system) it has been all but abandoned. Elsewhere, such as in Asia and Australia, different versions of the original <b>digital</b> <b>radio</b> standard have been adopted; meanwhile the US has taken a completely different approach.

40|$|The UK {{remains one}} of the world’s leading {{countries}} in the development of <b>digital</b> <b>radio.</b> However, it is unclear when radio will migrate from analogue to digital broadcasting in a similar way to television, which is progressively switching to digital transmission in a number of countries.
