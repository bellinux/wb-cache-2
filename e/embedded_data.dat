The algorithm {{is based on}} changing the relative length of the middle segment between two successive maximum and minimum peaks to <b>embed</b> <b>data.</b> Spline interpolation is used to change the lengths. To ensure smooth monotonic behavior between peaks, a hybrid orthogonal and nonorthogonal wavelet decomposition is used prior to <b>data</b> <b>embedding.</b> The possible <b>data</b> <b>embedding</b> rates are between 20 and 30 bps.

In this paper, we present a new robust hybrid watermarking scheme based on DCT and SVD.

These four quadrants represent frequency bands from the lowest to the highest. The singular values in each quadrant are then modified by the singular values of the DCT-transformed visual watermark.

The recent {{popularity}} of digital media such as CD-ROM and the Internet has prompted exploration of techniques for <b>embedding</b> <b>data,</b> either visibly or invisibly, into text, image, and audio objects.

30|$|Recently, {{reversible}} {{data hiding}} (RDH) techniques for JPEG images {{have become more}} extensively used to combine image and authentication information conveniently into one file. Although <b>embedding</b> <b>data</b> in JPEG image degrades visual quality and increases file size, it is proven to be useful for data communication and image authentication. In this paper, a data hiding method in JPEG image using a new coefficient selection technique is proposed. The proposed scheme <b>embeds</b> <b>data</b> using the histogram shifting (HS) method. According {{to the number of}} zero AC coefficients, block ordering is used to <b>embed</b> <b>data</b> first in the blocks causing less distortion. In order to further reduce the distortion, positions of AC coefficients are selected carefully. Finally, AC coefficients valued + 1 and − 1 are used for embedding, and the remaining non-zero AC coefficients are shifted to the left or right directions according to their sign. Compared to the current state-of-the-art method, experimental results show that the proposed method has higher peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and smaller file size.|$|R

40|$|A {{steganalysis}} {{system based}} on 2 -D Markov chain of thresholded prediction-error image is proposed in this paper. Image pixels are predicted with their neighboring pixels, and the prediction-error image is generated by subtracting the prediction value from the pixel value and then thresholded with a predefined threshold. The empirical transition matrixes of Markov chain along the horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions serve as features for steganalysis. Support vector machines (SVM) are utilized as classifier. The effectiveness of the proposed system has been demonstrated by extensive experimental investigation. The detection rate for Cox et al. ’s non-blind spread spectrum (SS) data hiding method, Piva et al. ’s blind SS method, and a generic QIM method (as <b>embedding</b> <b>data</b> rate being 0. 1 bpp (bits per pixel)) are all above 90 % over an image database consisting of approximately 4000 images.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel high capacity steganography algorithm for <b>embedding</b> <b>data</b> in the inactive frames of {{low bit rate}} audio streams encoded by G. 723. 1 source codec, which is used extensively in Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). This study reveals that, contrary to existing thoughts, the inactive frames of VoIP streams {{are more suitable for}} <b>data</b> <b>embedding</b> than the active frames of the streams, that is, steganography in the inactive audio frames attains a larger <b>data</b> <b>embedding</b> capacity than that in the active audio frames under the same imperceptibility. By analysing the concealment of steganography in the inactive frames of low bit rate audio streams encoded by G. 723. 1 codec with 6. 3 kbps, the authors propose a new algorithm for steganography in different speech parameters of the inactive frames. Performance evaluation shows <b>embedding</b> <b>data</b> in various speech parameters led to different levels of concealment. An improved voice activity detection algorithm is suggested for detecting inactive audio frames taking into packet loss account. Experimental results show our proposed steganography algorithm not only achieved perfect imperceptibility but also gained a high <b>data</b> <b>embedding</b> rate up to 101 bits/frame, indicating that the <b>data</b> <b>embedding</b> capacity of the proposed algorithm is very much larger than those of previously suggested algorithms...|$|R

Due to growing need for security of data, image steganography is gaining popularity. The traditional image steganography algorithm is Least Significant Bit embedding, but it can be easily detected by the attackers as it <b>embeds</b> <b>data</b> sequentially in all pixels. Instead of sequentially <b>embedding</b> <b>data,</b> <b>data</b> can be <b>embedded</b> in random pixels, but it causes speckles in the image. A better approach is to hide the data in the regions like edges. An attacker has less suspicion of the presence of data bits in edges, because pixels in edges appear to be either much brighter or dimmer than their neighbors. So we present a novel technique to hide data in the edges of the image by extending the Least Significant Bit embedding algorithm. This algorithm hides data in the edge pixels and thus ensures better security against attackers...|$|R
