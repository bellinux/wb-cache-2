5|$|Yamashiro was {{completed}} on 31 March 1917 and {{assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 1st Fleet in 1917–18, though she had no combat role in World War <b>I.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>her</b> sister, she patrolled {{off the coast of}} China during the war and assisted during the Great Kanto Earthquake. Little detailed information is available about her activities during the 1920s, although she did make a port visit to Port Arthur, China, on 5 April 1925 and also conducted training off the coast of China. Yamashiro became flagship of the Combined Fleet in 1935. In early 1941, the ship experimentally launched radio-controlled Kawanishi E7K2 floatplanes.|$|E
500|$|... "Love Song" [...] {{tells the}} story of an ex-girlfriend fondly remembered ("I knew a girl and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> still"). It is the first of two songs which feature dreamlike-senses in the lyrics ("I'll lay my head down and see what I see"). Barrett {{performed}} the song for Bob Harris' show in 1971.|$|E
6000|$|Our {{host and}} hostess had {{by this time}} {{returned}} from church, and Mrs. Hall came frankly and heartily {{to the door to}} greet us, scolding us (kindly) for having got wet. [...] . <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> simple, easy, gentle, quiet manners, and <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> husband too.|$|R
6000|$|Yes, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> today. A {{little or}} much? Don't know. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> {{and it seems}} a new feeling to me. Then, in that case, all the rest, all that I thought I thought and all that I felt I felt, all the rest before now, in fact... O, give it up, old chap! Sleep it off! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> {{better when}} she was spiteful than {{when she was}} smooth. I didn't feel so scared of her then.|$|R
500|$|On the {{creation}} of Yang, Shonda Rhimes said the character contained [...] "a little bit of [...] personality". Speaking with talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Rhimes said: [...] "Cristina was second, simply because she's {{the kind of woman}} I know really well, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her.</b> There's something interesting about a person who is that driven, a little bit emotionally disconnected but still a caring, sweet, and smart individual you could be friends with." [...] Sandra Oh, initially auditioned for the character of Bailey, adding: [...] "Thank God I did not get that part", explaining the show would not be the same without fellow cast member, Wilson. Discussing casting Oh as Yang, Rhimes said: [...] "She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit. One of my favorite things to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{writer from}} the Jamaica Gleaner noted that viewers had been getting restless with Jill's newfound {{closeness}} to Katherine, noting that, [...] "Katherine and Jill {{are at their}} best when they are at each other's throats." [...] Of the storyline where she returned to Jabot Cosmetics, Cooper stated: [...] "Since I {{went back into the}} business of business, I've been taking away some of Jill's power. You wanna go broke? Leave your company in the hands of Jill! The other day, we were filming some confrontational scenes, and Jess [...] says, 'Doesn't it feel good?' And the crew is like: 'Good! The girls are at it again!'" [...] Lilana Novakovich of The Record noted that the rivalry between the two women has [...] "outlived most marriages". Cooper stated: [...] "The audience – both young and old – relate to the Kay/Jill relationship". Walton describes their relationship as [...] "incredible" [...] and said: [...] "The love and the hate is so mixed, and there is never any telling when it will bubble out now. [...] It used to be, “This month <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her...</b> this month I hate her.” [...] Now, it’s more from moment to moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a {{child she}} {{spent much time}} at court, where {{her mother was a}} Gentlewoman of the Privy Chamber and a close confidante of Queen Elizabeth <b>I.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>her</b> brother, Philip Sidney, she {{received}} a humanist education which included classical languages, French, Italian, music and needlework. Following the death of Mary's youngest sister, Ambrosia, in 1575, the queen requested Mary to return to court to join the royal entourage.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> {{from the}} moment I saw her, and set myself to {{interest}} and please her as well as I knew how.|$|R
5000|$|Bogarde persuaded Margaret Lockwood to co star. [...] "I was dubious {{about being}} able to lay such a character, though <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> honesty," [...] said Lockwood.|$|R
60|$|In {{answer to}} this question, which was oddly abrupt, <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> very much and thought she was more {{agreeable}} than she used to be.|$|R
2500|$|For the album's {{artwork and}} promotional images, Amos enlisted fashion {{photographer}} Karen Collins. [...] "I {{love the way}} [...] shoots women," [...] Amos stated about the photographer's work. [...] "It's not vulgar or demeaning, but I find it just sexy. They look empowered to me, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> style." [...] The setting for the album's artwork is a cream-colored hotel room, with various photos of Amos depicting different ideas of sensuality through images such as voyeurism and sadomasochism, both of which tie into the ideas of power explored throughout the album. Collins' images {{was used for the}} cover artwork on both single releases from the album.|$|E
2500|$|In the Napoleonic war epic Scuola d'eroi (1914), Menichelli had a cameo as {{a drummer}} girl. Legend {{has it that}} her {{performance}} struck Giovanni Pastrone, the director of Cabiria, who cut a frame from the film reel and ordered that the unknown actress be brought to Itala Films of Turin. However, reviews of her last films at Cines [...] suggest that Menichelli was well {{on her way to}} film stardom before her move to Itala Films. Menichelli had graduated to starring roles in feature films, and her performances were generally positively reviewed, earning her favourable comparisons with Lyda Borelli and Francesca Bertini, the two most famous Italian film actresses of the time. One reviewer noted Menichelli's, [...] "uncommon talent," [...] in Alla Deriva (1915). Commenting on La casa di nessuno (1915), another reviewer remarked, [...] "The public like Menichelli, and that's enough. I could say that <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> too." ...|$|E
2500|$|The infanta was {{received}} at the Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa {{at the beginning}} of May 1785, and on , the couple received a nuptial benediction at the palace chapel. At the same time, John's sister, the Infanta Mariana Victoria, was married to the Infante Gabriel, also of the Spanish royal family. An assiduous correspondence between John and Mariana at that time reveals that the absence of his sister weighed upon him and, comparing her to his young wife, he wrote, [...] "She is very smart and has a lot of judgment, whereas you have rather little, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> a lot, but for all that I cannot love her equally." [...] John's young bride was little given to docility, requiring at times the correction of Queen Maria herself. Furthermore, the difference in their ages (John being 18 years old) made him uncomfortable and anxious. Because Carlota was so young, the marriage had not been consummated, and John wrote, [...] "Here's to the arrival of the time when I shall play a lot with the Infanta. The way these things go, I think six years from now. Better that she be a bit more grown up than when she came." [...] The consummation waited until [...] In 1793, Carlota gave birth to the first of nine children: Teresa, Princess of Beira.|$|E
6000|$|... "No such thing. Let me tell you, Colonel, {{my heart}} {{has been in}} it ever since I felt the relief of meeting real truth and unselfishness! <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> that first evening, when she was manfully chasing us off for {{frivolous}} danglers round <b>her</b> cousin! <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> for having no conventionalities, fast or slow, and especially for hating heroes! And when my sister had helped to let her get into this intolerable web, how could I look on without feeling the nobleness that has never shifted blame from herself, but bowed, owned all, suffered--suffered--oh, how grievously!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I quarrelled with <b>her</b> less, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> less,' {{answered}} Berenger--who, {{since the}} act of separation, {{had not been so}} guarded in his demeanour, and began to give way to his natural frankness.|$|R
6000|$|Marian was {{thoughtful}} all day; and at last, when {{sitting alone}} with Mrs. Wortley and Agnes, exclaimed, [...] "Poor Miss Morley! I really am {{very sorry for}} her; I did not know <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> so well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] Newman {{answered}} presently, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> {{because she}} has lived near you so long. Since your birth, she told me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eustacia {{has told}} me. He did pay {{her a little}} {{attention}} a year ago; but there's no harm in that. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> all the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh I’m {{willing to}} stand by that.” And he had another try, {{which would have been}} {{transparent}} to a compatriot. “I guess <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> type.” ...|$|E
60|$|So I {{chatted with}} Nan Brown, and studied her. She was a pretty, laughing, coquettish little minx and quite {{baseball}} mad. I had met many girl fans, but none so enthusiastic as Nan. But she was wholesome and sincere, and <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are much}} indebted to him, and to her," [...] said Lord Rotherwood courteously. [...] "She {{looked as if}} she hated it all in the first scene, though she warmed up afterwards. I must say <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> the better for her shyness." ...|$|R
60|$|MARGARET (shuddering). <b>I</b> didn't <b>like</b> <b>her</b> {{saying that}} about your losing me.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so, Bathurst. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> so {{much that}} I should be very sorry to see her throw herself away upon some empty headed fool. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> greatly, and I was {{convinced}} that you were just the man to make her happy, and as I knew that you had good prospects in England, I {{thought it would be}} a capital match for her, although you are but a young civilian; and I own that of late I have thought things were going on very well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, and {{she always}} sticks pins and daggers into her head, to {{increase}} that effect. I must say <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> husband better: he is so clever.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Susy {{looks as}} gay as a feather-duster. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her.</b> She never snubs a fellow," [...] said Joe, much {{impressed}} with the splendor of the court ladies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{ought to}} have given Agatha a plainer hint; but, except for school managers, we're not very {{conventional}} people in this country. Then <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> pluck. It's weak {{to give way to}} the prejudices of censorious folks. Besides, in a sense, she really wasn't rash." ...|$|R
6000|$|Libby {{looked as}} if this were rather a new and droll idea. But he seemed not to object to her {{tutoring}} him. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "as far as Mrs. Maynard was concerned, I don't know that <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> any more than I respected her." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{wonder if}} Mrs. Rennie is really as {{handsome}} as Mrs. Burnett says. I wonder how old she is. I {{wonder if she}} ever cared for Sidney ... no, she didn't. No woman who cared for Sidney could ever have thrown him over for an old moneybag. I wonder if <b>I</b> shall <b>like</b> <b>her.</b> No, <b>I</b> won't. I'm sure <b>I</b> shan't <b>like</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Why--yes, indeed. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her.</b> But I did {{not think}} of her in {{relation}} to you--that way. I am greatly surprised. Alfred, is she well born? What connections?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> singing best. I {{am sorry}} she can't sing this evening, {{as it is}} always such a treat to me to listen to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No--not {{particularly}} pretty. But <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> body. And I {{like the}} fresh air. I like the fresh air, the summer sea-air all through it--through her as well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hate to say}} it [...] . {{it seems}} so disloyal [...] . but, well, <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> Ruby Gillis now. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> when we went to school and Queen's {{together}} [...] . though not so well as you and Jane of course. But this last year at Carmody she seems so different [...] . so [...] . so [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{suppose she}} was {{expected}} to have any friends. I can't say <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her.</b> But <b>I</b> don't think I disliked her {{so much as the}} author does. She's pretty hard on her good-looking"--he was going to say girls, but as if that might have been rather personal, he said--"people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must confess}} that <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> better {{when she first}} came to Canada. She hadn't begun to remodel {{arrangements}} at her husband's homestead then. Hunter, I understand, came into some money shortly before he married her, and--" [...] he paused with a little laugh--"most {{of my friends are}} poor." ...|$|R
