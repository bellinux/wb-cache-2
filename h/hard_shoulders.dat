5|$|An {{additional}} third lane {{was added}} {{in each direction}} in 1966 using the land reserved within the central reservation, without the need to modify existing bridges. Despite the relative ease in this work, the lack of <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> at the bridges meant the number of available lanes during engineering works was inadequate {{to cope with the}} traffic volumes of the time, estimated to be have been in the region of 140,000 vehicles daily. Construction of the M61 motorway in 1969–1970 to carry Manchester traffic northbound had its northern terminus connect to a new junction on the by-pass at Bamber Bridge, requiring the construction of Blacow Bridge to carry the north-bound M61 traffic over the M6.|$|E
5|$|The {{contracted}} {{period for}} construction was {{planned to be}} around two years, but the timescale was lengthened by nearly 25% due to rainfall that persisted {{throughout much of the}} early construction period. The heavy rainfall in late 1956 had profound effects on the heavy engineering works required to construct the road foundation, resulting in this aspect of work being postponed until early 1957; an extension of five months was granted due to the extraordinary and unforeseen weather conditions. Numerous lessons were learnt from the construction of Britain's first motorway, particularly towards using an appropriately screened base material, with water drainage systems that should be appropriate and fit for purposes, as well as the inclusion of continuous <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders.</b>|$|E
25|$|The N4 Sligo road has a bypass {{around the}} town, which {{consists}} of single carriageway with <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> and four roundabouts. It was opened on 2 June 1995 and constitutes part of the planned Longford Ring Road which will encircle the town when completed.|$|E
50|$|When {{the speed}} limit has been lowered to 50 mph or below the <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> can be opened as an {{additional}} lane. To facilitate this and still maintain safety a series of refuge areas have been created around every 500 m along that stretch of the road. These {{take the form of}} lay bys {{to the side of the}} <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> and contain the SOS phones within them. In the event of a vehicle breaking down on the <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder,</b> operators can close it or they can close a lane to allow emergency services access to an accident. The <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> is never opened on the sections under a junction between the off and on slip roads. Close to junctions use of the <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> as a lane is restricted to traffic exiting or entering at that junction.|$|R

25|$|Because of its height, the narrowness of the spans (there are no <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders),</b> the low guardrails, and the {{frequency}} of high winds, it is {{known as one of the}} scariest bridges in the world, especially in higher tractor-trailer trucks. Several incidents related to the bridge have occurred. In some cases, these have caused significant closures and traffic congestion on either side approaching the bridge.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} sections, {{where there}} was no need to bypass the existing route, were not originally upgraded to motorway standard, but to dual carriageway without <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> or full grade separation. The gradual construction of the M6 from Rugby (where it met the M1 to London) to Carlisle in 1970, where it terminated on the A74, meant that the route from Glasgow to London was entirely dual carriageway.|$|E
25|$|Running {{approximately}} parallel both to {{the coast}} of the Solent and to the A27, the M27 starts as an eastwards continuation of the A31 from Bournemouth and Poole, meets the A36 from Salisbury, crosses the Wessex Main Line railway, and then meets the M271 to central Southampton. After the M271, the road becomes a dual four lane motorway and passes Rownhams services, it then meets the M3, (two lanes going off, two lanes continuing {{to the other side of}} the junction) reverting to a dual three lane motorway as it passes to the north of Southampton, passes Southampton Airport, meeting Junction 7 and becoming dual four lanes again, then becoming dual three lanes after Junction 8, it then runs alongside the West Coastway Line as it heads south-east towards Fareham. It then runs alongside the northern outskirts of Fareham, briefly with a fourth climbing lane in either direction, before its junction with the M275 to Portsmouth. Very shortly after this point the motorway ends, becoming the A27, a four lane dual carriageway almost to motorway standards until the junction with the A3 (M) Motorway. The official reason for this section of road not being a continuation of the motorway is the <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> being too narrow. Although the M275 which the M27 junctions with, has no official <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> throughout its entire length.|$|E

2500|$|The National Roads Authority in {{conjunction}} with Cavan and Donegal County Councils plan major improvements to the N3 route in Ulster. It is currently planned that the Virginia bypass will be developed as 12.5 kilometres of type 2 dual carriageway ( [...] known as 2+2). Type two dual carriageway has reduced width or no <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders</b> and also a reduced width median. This approach significantly cuts land acquisition costs.|$|E
2500|$|A dual {{carriageway}} with grade-separated junctions and which meets other requirements may be upgraded to motorway standard, denoted by an (M) added after the road number (e.g. [...] "A1(M)" [...] or [...] "A38(M)"). Unlike in Ireland, {{there was no}} official terminology for 'high-quality {{dual carriageway}}s' until April 2015, when in England a new standard was set to designate certain high-quality routes formally as [...] "Expressways". Many roads such as the A1, the A14, the A19 and the A42 are built to a high quality, with grade-separated junctions, full barriers at roadside and central reservations and, in some cases, three lanes of traffic. They may still fall short of motorway standard in terms of <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders,</b> the height of overpasses or the quality of intersecting junctions.|$|E
2500|$|The National Development Plan (1989–1993) {{set out a}} {{programme}} of road improvements costed at €1,257 million (1989 prices): it [...] "included thirty-four major improvement projects {{involving the}} provision of dual carriageway or motorway on 290 kilometres of national primary routes"; another 290 kilometers were to be upgraded to wide single carriageway standard (7.3 metre carriageway plus two 3 metre <b>hard</b> <b>shoulders).</b> A further €3,316 million (1994 prices) was spent on national primary routes between 1994 and 1999. Four key strategic corridors were identified for major improvements.

The Welsh Assembly Government revived the scheme as the M4 relief road tolled bypass in 2007 but later abandoned it for financial reasons. An extension to the Newport Southern Distributor Road through the old Corus steel works is being considered. This road is already a dual carriageway but not open to the public. A public consultation exercise on options for improving {{the capacity of the}} M4 corridor around Newport opened on 5 March 2012. [...] Its website states that: [...] "the motorway around Newport does not conform to today’s motorway standards.

40|$|UK {{motorways}} {{are experiencing}} growing congestion problems as {{the volume of}} traffic increases. Many innovative solutions are being considered within the current network to try and tackle this problem. One scheme that has been created and already implemented in particular motorway networks {{is the use of}} the <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> as an additional running lane. The <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> running (HSR) scheme has created challenges in itself, and therefore further trials have been required to understand the impact on road users. This scheme for increasing network capacity relies on the opening and closing of the <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> when needed. For example, opening the <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> when traffic is particularly congested or closing the <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> if a breakdown has occurred. This study seeks to understand driver comprehension of <b>hard</b> <b>shoulder</b> running when driving through and entering/exiting junctions. It is vital that drivers are aware of the status of the lanes and that it does not cause confusion, as this could potentially lead to an accident. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate drivers’ responses to a simulated Full Time Through Junction Running (FT TJR) scheme under conditions of high traffic density. This is to gain an overall understanding of how drivers are likely to behave in schemes of this nature, and to enable the creation of a safe and comprehensive design. The concept needs to be viewed by the motoring public as useable and a positive experience to ensure the additional network capacity is utilised correctly...|$|R
