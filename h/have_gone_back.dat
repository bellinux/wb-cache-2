5|$|Sri Lankan Tamils {{continue}} to seek refuge in countries like Canada and Australia. The International Organization for Migration and the Australian government have declared Tamil refugees as economic migrants.

5|$|The next day, Archie follows {{through on}} Regina's warning by convincing Henry that {{the fairy tale}} stories are not real, {{upsetting}} Henry. This prompts Emma to {{pay a visit to}} Archie as she figures out that Regina was responsible for threatening him. Emma accuses Regina of threatening Archie, but Regina says that Henry is missing again. Archie conjectures that Henry may <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> to the mine shaft. There, Henry begins to investigate the area and comes across a glass item similar to the one Regina found earlier that he puts into his backpack. Archie goes in to search for Henry and finds the boy, but as they try to escape, an aftershock blocks off the main entrance, leaving an injured Archie and Henry trapped. They find an elevator shaft, not knowing that above ground Emma and Regina have taken the suggestion of blasting the main entrance from Marco (Tony Amendola), which results in the elevator carrying Henry and Archie being lowered even further after the blast takes place.|$|E
60|$|Which was better? {{he asked}} himself. All this was Dede's own thought. It {{was what she}} had meant when she prayed he would go broke. He held up his {{offending}} right arm. It wasn't the same old arm. Of course she could not love that arm and that body as she had loved the strong, clean arm and body of years before. He didn't like that arm and body himself. A young whippersnapper {{had been able to}} take liberties with it. It <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> on him. He sat up suddenly. No, by God, he <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> on it! He <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> on himself. He <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> on Dede. She was right, a thousand times right, and she had sense enough to know it, sense enough to refuse to marry a money slave with a whiskey-rotted carcass.|$|R

25|$|The 80th {{floor of}} the {{original}} design was planned to be an observation deck, {{the first one in}} Miami. The complex was later redesigned as two 70-floor towers, with the main tower being all office space, hence taller. The shorter tower was to be all hotel space. The current design goes back to a single mixed-use tower with 80 floors on a large podium with the top floors being office space and the bottom being hotel or residential space. The observation deck {{can be seen in the}} schematic diagram. Two FECR published sources <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> to the floor count of 80 with the 1,010-foot design, and renderings of this design from 2009 show an observation deck, as well as the Metromover connection, in the blueprints.|$|E

Ned takes his sons to witness Will's execution. Will reports repeatedly {{that he saw}} White Walkers, but nobody believes him. The young man faces death bravely, admitting that he [...] "should <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> to the Wall and warned them". Ned himself passes sentence and beheads him. When Bran asks his father about the ranger's talk of White Walkers, Ned dismisses it as a madman's ravings, insisting that the Walkers have been considered extinct for thousands of years.|$|E
500|$|Spencer was a {{difficult}} and hyperactive child  with poor school attendance. Raised as a Catholic, at nine years old he {{was placed in the}} care of Dominican nuns in the hope of transforming his behavior. Later in life he remarked, [...] "I never would <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> to school if there had been any other way of learning to read the subtitles in the movies." [...] He became fascinated with motion pictures, watching the same ones repeatedly and then re-enacting scenes to his friends and neighbors. Tracy attended several Jesuit academies in his teenage years, which he claimed took the [...] "badness" [...] out of him and helped him improve his grades. At Marquette Academy he met future actor Pat O'Brien, and the pair began attending plays together, awakening Tracy's interest in the theatre.|$|E
500|$|The Union {{supply ship}} Eugene was fired at by Confederate rebels on the Mississippi River {{at the second}} Chickasaw Bluff, while {{carrying}} supplies to Memphis in September 1862. Major General Sherman ordered Colonel Charles C. Walcutt of the 46th Ohio Infantry to Randolph. He informed his subordinate officer that [...] "the attack on the Eugene was by a small force of guerrillas from Loosahatchie, who by this time <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>back,</b> and therefore you will find no one at Randolph" [...] (emphasis in the original). Although he could not locate the snipers, Sherman was determined to punish those who helped them, thus sealing the fate of Randolph. Sherman instructed Walcutt to [...] "destroy the place, leaving one house to mark the place". Union Army soldiers under Colonel Walcutt's command burned Randolph {{in retaliation for the}} guerrilla activities emerging from the area. To his superior officer, Major General Ulysses S. Grant, Sherman reported that he had [...] "given public notice that a repetition [...] will justify any measures of retaliation, such as loading the boats with guerrilla prisoners where they would receive fire". In 1869, Ulysses S. Grant (1822–85) would become the 18th President of the United States and William T. Sherman would become commanding General of the United States Army.|$|E

Her exit has been described by journalist Danny Buckland as Josie's only decent storyline, but he adds [...] "even this belated plot was unrealistic". Hooley commented, [...] "There was no explanation about the visa problem.
