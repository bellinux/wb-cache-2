5|$|Most notable part of Ninja Gaiden, which {{certainly}} made it famous, was its unforgiving, challenging difficulty, especially with very steep platforms, enemies that respawn upon dying {{unless they are}} close enough, aerial enemies and complicated platforming sections, all combined, make Ninja Gaiden {{one of the hardest}} <b>games</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> NES, and its difficulty setting earned it both praise and criticism.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the home}} {{teams in the}} playoffs were decided based on a yearly rotation. From 1970 to 1974, the {{division}}al playoff round rotated which of the three division champions would not have home field advantage, with the wild-card teams and the teams they would face in the divisional playoff game would never have home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Starting in 1970, the divisional playoff games consisted of the AFC Central champions and the NFC West champions playing their <b>games</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road. Then in 1971 it rotated to the AFC East champions and the NFC East champions playing their <b>games</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road. In the 1972 divisional playoff games, the AFC West champions and the NFC Central champions were the visiting teams. And 1973 it would start all over with the AFC Central and NFC West again, and so on.|$|E

5|$|The {{game has}} been praised for staying true to the comedic {{nature of the}} series, for its {{entertaining}} writing, and for the detail to which the background material is explained.

5|$|After {{the success}} of the first two Broken Sword <b>games</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> PlayStation, Sony {{contacted}} Revolution Software to develop a game to be released initially on the console.

Director Charles Cecil stated that the game was inspired by crime films such as Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects. The game engine was written specifically for the title. It was released to average reviews from critics, who praised the game's story, puzzles and graphics, but criticized its controls, action scenes and animation.|$|E

An 8-bit port was released for Game Gear, which itself served as the basis for a Master System port released exclusively in Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Criticism {{focused on}} {{particular}} {{aspects of the}} game. Miller considered the inability to save progress a drawback since gamers will {{have to play the}} entire game in one sitting if they wish to complete it.
