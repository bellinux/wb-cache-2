500|$|For {{decades the}} Roman Catholic Church avoided {{official}} refutation of evolution. However, it would rein in Catholics who proposed that evolution could {{be reconciled with}} the Bible, as this conflicted with the First Vatican Council's (1869–70) finding that everything was created out of nothing by God, and to deny that finding could lead to excommunication. In 1950, the encyclical Humani generis of Pope Pius XII first mentioned evolution directly and officially. It allowed one to enquire into the concept of humans coming from pre-existing living matter, but not to question Adam and Eve or {{the creation of the}} soul. In 1996, Pope John Paul II said that evolution is [...] "more than a hypothesis" [...] and acknowledged the large body of work accumulated in its support, but reiterated that any attempt to give a material explanation of the human soul is [...] "incompatible with the truth about man." [...] Pope Benedict XVI has reiterated the conviction that human beings [...] "are not some casual and meaningless product of evolution. <b>Each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> the result of a thought of God. <b>Each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> willed, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> loved, <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> necessary." [...] At the same time, he has promoted the study {{of the relationship between the}} concepts of creation and evolution, based on the conviction that there cannot be a contradiction between faith and reason. Along these lines, the research project Thomistic Evolution, run by a team of Dominican scholars, endeavours to reconcile the scientific evidence on evolution with the teaching of Thomas Aquinas.|$|E

2500|$|Augustine, one {{of western}} Christianity's most {{influential}} early Christian thinkers, described the soul as [...] "a special substance, endowed with reason, adapted {{to rule the}} body". Some Christians espouse a trichotomic view of humans, which characterizes humans as consisting of a body (soma), soul (psyche), and spirit (pneuma). However, the majority of modern Bible scholars point out how spirit and soul are used interchangeably in many biblical passages, and so hold to dichotomy: the view that <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> body and soul. Paul said that the [...] "body wars against" [...] the soul, [...] "For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing {{as far as the}} division of soul and spirit" [...] (Heb 4:12 NASB), and that [...] "I buffet my body", to keep it under control.|$|E
