5|$|A fierce {{defense was}} {{launched}} {{from within the}} walls, even as Bowie and Travis made unsuccessful attempts {{to negotiate with the}} Mexican army. Travis repeatedly dispatched couriers with pleas for reinforcements.

5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the double burden in Africa {{is that there is}} class divide, meaning that most white families, {{including}} poor ones, employ Africans <b>either</b> <b>as</b> a live-in worker or a part-time worker.

Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell. On rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes form {{in association with the}} mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, {{in the same manner as}} the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado <b>either</b> <b>as</b> a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a supercell.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{sketches}} were derived almost exclusively from the books, whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes interspersed with cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles and recipes, proved easily adaptable {{to the screen}} <b>either</b> <b>as</b> raw material or creative inspiration. In later series, as usable material from the books and other obvious sources began to run out, concepts were drawn from more standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the oral}} polio vaccine is inexpensive, easy to administer, and {{produces}} excellent immunity in the intestine (which helps prevent infection with wild virus in areas where it is endemic), {{it has been the}} vaccine of choice for controlling poliomyelitis in many countries. On very rare occasions (about one case per 750,000 vaccine recipients), the attenuated virus in the {{oral polio vaccine}} reverts into a form that can paralyze. Most industrialized countries have switched to inactivated polio vaccine, which cannot revert, <b>either</b> <b>as</b> the sole vaccine against poliomyelitis or in combination with oral polio vaccine.|$|E

Today, such activities are more common <b>either</b> <b>as</b> hobbies, for entertainment and tourism, or for sports such as pigeon racing.|$|E
