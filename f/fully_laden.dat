5|$|During 1918, Australia and the Grand Fleet's {{other capital}} ships on {{occasion}} escorted convoys travelling between Britain and Norway. The 2nd BCS spent {{the period from}} 8 to 21 February covering these convoys in company with battleships and destroyers, and put to sea on 6 March in company with the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron to support minelayers. From 8 March on, the battlecruiser tested the capabilities of aircraft launched from platforms mounted over 'P' and 'Q' turrets. Australia, {{along with the rest}} of the Grand Fleet, sortied on the afternoon of 23 March 1918 after radio transmissions had revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. However, the Germans were too far ahead of the British and escaped without firing a shot. The 2nd BCS sailed again on 25 April to support minelayers, then cover one of the Scandinavian convoys the next day. Following the successful launch of a <b>fully</b> <b>laden</b> Sopwith 1½ Strutter scout plane on 14 May, Australia started carrying two aircraft—a Strutter for reconnaissance, and a Sopwith Camel fighter—and operated them until the end of the war. The 2nd BCS again supported minelayers in the North Sea between 25–26 June and 29–30 July. During September and October, Australia and the 2nd BCS supervised and protected minelaying operations north of Orkney.|$|E

There had been speculation that Vale Brasil {{was not allowed to}} enter the Chinese port <b>fully</b> <b>laden,</b> but according to Vale the destination was changed due to commercial, not political reasons. The ship arrived at the port of Taranto on 14 July 2011 to discharge her cargo. Since then, <b>fully</b> <b>laden</b> Valemax vessels have unloaded at various ports, such as Dalian in China, Sohar in Oman, Rotterdam, Ōita in Japan, Dangjin in South Korea, and the transshipment hub Vale has constructed at Subic Bay in the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|The tunnel's {{design was}} {{incompatible}} with the ASG class Garratt steam locomotives used by the Western Australian Government Railways in the 1940s. The worst accident in the tunnel was on 5 November 1942, when both drivers and firemen were asphyxiated by carbon monoxide, one driver dying, when a <b>fully</b> <b>laden</b> double-header train passed through the tunnel at walking pace.|$|E
25|$|Construction of a new, hexagonally shaped {{terminal}} {{complex on}} the airport's south side began during the 1960s. This {{coincided with the}} lengthening of the runways to permit <b>fully</b> <b>laden</b> widebodied aircraft to take off and land without restricting their range and construction of a motorway and access road linking the new terminal to the city centre. It became operational on 1 November 1974.|$|E
25|$|According to Vale, {{the discussions}} about {{allowing}} the Valemax ships to enter Chinese ports had been ongoing since the ban came into {{force and the}} Chinese officials had given a preliminary go-ahead {{for the construction of}} new berths capable of accommodating the 400,000-ton ships. According to the Ningbo Port Company, the construction of the new port facilities would take two to three years, causing further delays for Vale which in the meantime is losing $2–3 per ton of ore due to the ban. On 15 April 2013, Vale Malaysia became the first 400,000-ton Valemax vessel to call a Chinese port. The partially loaded ship docked at the port of Lianyungang en route from the Vale transshipment hub in Subic Bay, Philippines. However, at the time the Chinese officials had not yet lifted the ban for <b>fully</b> <b>laden</b> Valemax vessels. The first <b>fully</b> <b>laden</b> Valemax vessel to call a Chinese port since 2012, Shandong Da Ren, docked at the Dongjiakou port in Qingdao on 2 October 2014. The ban was officially lifted in July 2015.|$|E

25|$|In September 2014, Vale {{signed a}} {{framework}} agreement for strategic co-operation in iron ore shipping with the state-owned China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company (COSCO). Later that month, a 25-year freight contract was signed between Vale and China Merchants Group. As {{part of the}} agreement, the Chinese shipping company will construct 10 new very large ore carriers to transport iron ore from Brazil to China. Following these agreements, China's ban for Valemax vessels has been effectively lifted and <b>fully</b> <b>laden</b> ships have called Chinese ports.|$|E
25|$|For a BBC Radio 4 documentary, Tom Mangold had {{an expert}} from Lloyds {{investigate}} {{the loss of}} Cyclops. The expert noted that manganese ore, being much denser than coal, had room to move within the holds even when <b>fully</b> <b>laden,</b> the hatch covers were canvas and that when wet the ore can become a slurry. As such, the load could shift and cause the ship to list. Combined with a possible loss of power from its one engine it could founder in bad weather.|$|E

Laënnec, also seriously damaged, was towed to Barry for repairs. One {{of the reasons}} for the incident was that she was not carrying enough sailing ballast on her voyage from the shipyard, and as a result her rudder was not completely submerged in water, significantly reducing the maneuverability of the ship. Towards the end of the nine-month voyage, while carrying potassium nitrate from Chile to Bremerhaven, Germany, a minor mutiny broke out when four crew members disobeyed orders from Captain Turbé.|$|E
25|$|Farnham {{became a}} {{successful}} market town; the author Daniel Defoe wrote that Farnham {{had the greatest}} corn-market after London, and describes 1,100 <b>fully</b> <b>laden</b> wagons delivering wheat to the town on market day. During the seventeenth century, other new industries evolved: greenware pottery (a pottery, dating from 1873, still exists {{on the outskirts of}} the town), wool and cloth, the processing of wheat into flour, and eventually hops, a key ingredient of beer. The Anglican divine, Augustus Montague Toplady, composer of the hymn Rock of Ages (1763, at Blagston) was born in Farnham in 1740 - a plaque now marks the building on West Street where he was born.|$|E

25|$|Early on, the TBM 700 was {{available}} in several different configurations and models. The introduction of the TBM 700C2, which increased the maximum takeoff weight from 6,578lb to 7,394lb, enabled operators to fly with both <b>fully</b> <b>laden</b> fuel tanks and maximum cabin occupancy instead of comprising between the two due to weight restrictions. The modifications made upon this model included {{the addition of a}} baggage compartment aft of the rear pressure bulkhead, the strengthening of the wing and landing gear, and seat crashworthiness certification for up to 20 G to accommodate for an elevated stall speed at higher weights. Around the same time, SOCATA decided to re-design the interior of the aircraft, both in terms of the fittings and finish, along with the adoption of a new integrated environmental control system, to improve passenger comfort levels.|$|E

25|$|Originally, Vale {{planned to}} own and manage a fleet of 19 Valemax vessels by itself {{in order to control}} the wildly {{fluctuating}} charter prices for large bulk carriers which had dropped from US$233,988 per day in June 2008 to as low as US$2,400 by December of the same year. However, because of the global economic downturn and the reluctance of Chinese ports to accept the <b>fully</b> <b>laden</b> ships, the new board of directors decided to focus capital allocation to mining. As a result, Vale decided to sell the ships and charter them back under long-term contracts. Although Vale was expected to suffer financial losses from selling the ships, they would have been covered by the profit from iron ore sales even at depressed ore prices if only one or two full shipments could be unloaded in Chinese ports.|$|E
