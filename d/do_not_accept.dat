5|$|Domains are a {{relatively}} new grouping. First proposed in 1977, Carl Woese's three-domain system was not generally accepted until later. One main characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of Archaea and Bacteria, previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called Monera), with the Eukaryota for all organisms whose cells contain a nucleus. A small number of scientists include a sixth kingdom, Archaea, but <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> the domain method.|$|E

This wider political sense is, he argued, accentuated by its English setting, where class differences are more marked than in the USA. The film pits passion and the dream of happiness against ambition and arrivisme, resolving the dispute with a pitiless blow that disallows all chance of justice.|$|E
5|$|Qiyas or analogical {{reason is}} the fourth source of the sharia for the {{majority}} of Sunni jurisprudence. It aims to draw analogies to a previously accepted decision. Shiites <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> analogy, but replace it with reason (aql); among Sunnis, the Hanbalites have traditionally been reluctant to accept analogy while the Zahirites don't accept it at all. Analogical reason in Islam is the process of legal deduction according to which the jurist, confronted with an unprecedented case, bases his or her argument on the logic used in the Qur'an and Sunnah. Legally sound analogy must not be based on arbitrary judgment, but rather be firmly rooted in the primary sources.|$|E
5|$|Richard's posthumous {{reputation}} {{has been}} shaped {{to a large extent}} by William Shakespeare, whose play Richard II portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition by Bolingbroke as responsible for the 15th-century Wars of the Roses. Modern historians <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> this interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. While probably not insane, as historians of the 19th and 20th centuries believed, he may have had what psychologists today identify as a personality disorder, particularly manifesting itself towards the end of his reign. Most authorities agree that, even though his policies were not unprecedented or entirely unrealistic, the way in which he carried them out was unacceptable to the political establishment, and this led to his downfall.|$|E

The government proclaims that the crash was caused by pilot error and closes the investigation. Knowing that Rathod was an ace pilot, Sonia and her friends <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> the official explanation. Instead, they claim that he sacrificed his life to save hundreds of other lives {{that would have been}} lost had he ejected from the aircraft and left it to crash into a populous city. They investigate and learn that the crash was due to a corrupt defence minister Shastri (Mohan Agashe), who had signed a contract exchanging cheap and illegal MiG-21 aircraft spare parts for a personal favour. To their surprise, they learn that the key person who was responsible for organizing the deal was Karan's father, Rajnath Singhania (Anupam Kher).|$|E
5|$|Raoul Wallenberg's half-brother, Guy von Dardel, a {{well-known}} physicist, retired from CERN, {{was dedicated to}} finding out his half-brother's fate. He traveled to the Soviet Union about fifty times for discussions and research, including {{an examination of the}} Vladimir prison records. Over the years, Professor von Dardel compiled a 50,000-page archive of interviews, journal articles, letters, and other documents related to his quest. In 1991, Dardel initiated a Swedish-Russian working group to search eleven separate military and government archives from the former Soviet Union for information about Wallenberg's fate, but the group was not able to find conclusive information. Many, including Professor von Dardel and his daughters Louise and Marie, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> the various versions of Wallenberg's death. They continue to request that the archives in Russia, Sweden, and Hungary be opened to impartial researchers.|$|E
5|$|Most Vietnamese are unrepresented in the Cambodian commune councils as {{they lack}} Cambodian citizenship. According to {{respondents}} from Ehrentraut's field research, {{the majority of}} Cambodian commune chiefs and officials express support in excluding Vietnamese representatives from getting citizenship and participating commune elections and meetings due to contempt. The Vietnamese appoint their own village heads, and convey community concerns Vietnamese community associations (Vietnamese: Tổng hội người Campuchia gốc Việt) that was first established in 2003. The community associations own limited assets and obtains funding from membership fees, donations from the Vietnamese embassy in Cambodia and sale of cemetery land from the Vietnamese communities. The funds are subsequently used to address Vietnamese communal concerns which includes supporting religious places of worship and teaching of the Vietnamese language, {{as well as providing}} assistance to disadvantaged families. While the community associations have the tacit support of the Vietnamese community, the majority <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> membership for fear of getting social stigma from mainstream Cambodian society. As of 2013, branches of these associations are established in 19 out of 23 provinces across Cambodia.|$|E
