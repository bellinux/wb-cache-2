5|$|The three cannot {{decide what}} to do with Hardenberg and take him to a remote, rarely used cabin {{belonging}} to Jule's uncle in the Tyrolean Austrian Alps near Jenbach, overlooking Achensee. As they try to <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> deal with their hostage, they learn that Hardenberg was a radical himself during the 1960s. A leader of the Socialist German Student Union, he was a good friend of Rudi Dutschke before marrying, getting a good job and abandoning his ideals.|$|E
5|$|After {{being caught}} by the Environmental Protection Agency dumping nuclear waste in the city park, Mr. Burns is fined $3 million. A town meeting is held so that the {{citizens}} can <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> spend the money. Marge suggests that the city {{use the money to}} fix Main Street, which is in poor condition. The town is about to vote in favor when someone new to town, a fast-talking salesman named Lyle Lanley, suggests that Springfield construct a city monorail. After being swayed by a song, the now enthused townspeople decide to build the monorail.|$|E
5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} with three or more boards. The game is played {{in exactly the same}} way as normal bughouse with boards placed with {{alternating}} colours and two players and one clock per board. On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will get that piece. In three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has to <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available.|$|E

5|$|The High Court {{agreed with}} the {{plaintiff}} that since the PSA had authority to <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> allocate berths, it was also entrusted with the duty to exercise that discretion after taking various key factors into consideration, and would have acted unlawfully if it had abrogated its responsibility by taking orders from other public authorities such as the Gambling Suppression Branch or the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board unless it was under a statutory duty to do so. However, on {{the facts of the}} case, the decision to deny berths to the plaintiff's cruise ship had been taken by the PSA alone.|$|E
5|$|In November 1968, Grant {{secured a}} $143,000 advance {{contract}} from Atlantic Records, {{which was then}} the biggest deal of its kind for a new band. Atlantic were a label with a catalogue of mainly blues, soul, and jazz artists, but in the late 1960s they began to {{take an interest in}} British progressive rock acts. Record executives signed Led Zeppelin without having ever seen them. Under the terms of their contract, the band had autonomy in deciding when they would release albums and tour, and had the final say over the contents and design of each album. They would also <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> promote each release and which tracks to release as singles. They formed their own company, Superhype, to handle all publishing rights.|$|E
5|$|Okabe did {{not want}} to use {{traditional}} lyrics, as he felt they would clash with the design of the world in the game, and wanted to use a variety of languages to represent the open nature of the game's world. He also {{did not want}} easily recognizable lyrics to be sung in the background while the characters were speaking, and for any noticeable words to instead evoke emotions in the player. Evans only knew English, Japanese, and French when she began the project; she listened to the other languages on YouTube to learn the rhythms and sounds of the languages and then mixed and changed them. Okabe largely allowed Evans to <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> integrate the lyrics with the early forms of the songs, and as he usually did not know where the songs would be used in the game gave her only light direction as to the emotional tone for the songs. The composers often would modify the songs in later revisions to follow how Evans had sung for that song.|$|E

5|$|While {{watching}} a 1950s science fiction movie, Bart and Lisa see {{a commercial for}} a model rocket kit and Bart orders it by using Homer's credit card number. Homer helps Bart and Milhouse build it, but it blows up before launching. Jealous that Ned Flanders built a superior rocket, Homer enlists {{the help of his}} former nerdy college roommates, Gary, Doug, and Benjamin, to build a rocket piloted by the hamster Nibbles. The rocket lifts off successfully, but it develops complications and Nibbles bails out. However, Homer makes an attempt to shoot down the rocket with a 12 gauge shotgun, but the rocket crashes into the church. The church council meets up to <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> come up with money to fund the repairs to the church, and with no other aid available they accept help from Mr. Burns and Lindsay Naegle who wish to run the church as a business. The two rebuild the church as a commercial monstrosity, complete with advertising signs, a Lard Lad statue, and a Jumbotron. Lisa is appalled at this and abandons the church, feeling her religion has lost its soul.|$|E
