40|$|AbstractViruses {{from the}} genus Pestivirus {{of the family}} Flaviviridae have a non-segmented, {{single-stranded}} RNA genome and can cause diseases in animals from the order Artiodactyla. Homologous recombination is rarely reported in this virus family. To detect possible recombination events, all complete pestivirus genomes that are available in GenBank were screened using distinct algorithms to detect <b>genetic</b> <b>conversions</b> and incongruent phylogenies. Three putative recombinant viruses derived from recombination from different pestivirus subtypes/genogroups were detected: Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV- 1) strain 3156, BVDV- 2 strain JZ 05 - 1 and Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) strain IND/UK/LAL- 290. The present study demonstrated that the pestivirus classification cannot be based only on the analysis of one fragment of the genome because <b>genetic</b> <b>conversions</b> can lead to errors. The designation of the recombinant forms (RF) provides a more informative structure for the nomenclature of the genetic variant. The present work reinforces that homologous recombination occurs in pestivirus populations under natural replication and describes the first evidence of recombination in BVDV- 2...|$|R

F 1 hybrids were {{generated by a}} cross between the wild #C. pseudozanguebariae$ and the anciently cultivated #C. liberica$ var. #dewevrei$ (DEW); progeny were then derived from a backcross between F 1 hybrid and DEW. The map construction consisted of a two-step strategy using 5. 5 and 3. 1 LOD scores revealed by simulation file. The map consisted of 181 loci : 167 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and 13 radom fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) loci. The markers were assembled into 14 linkage groups, each with 4 - 31 markers covering 1, 144 cM.

40|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of 16 deletions {{obtained in the}} amiA locus of pneumococcus is described. When present on donor DNA, all deletions increased drastically the frequency of wild-type recombinants in two-point crosses. This effect was maximal for deletions longer than 200 bases. It was reduced for heterologies shorter than 76 bases and did not exist for very short deletions. In three-point crosses in which the deletion was localized between two point mutations, we demonstrated that this excess of wild-type recombinants {{was the result of}} a <b>genetic</b> <b>conversion.</b> This conversion extended over several scores of bases outside the deletion. Conversion takes place during the heteroduplex stage of recombination. Therefore, in pneumococcal transformation, long heterologies participated in this heteroduplex configuration. As this conversion did not require an active DNA polymerase A gene it is proposed that the mechanism of conversion is not a DNA repair synthesis but involves breakage and ligation between DNA molecules. Conversion of deletions did not require the Hex system of correction of mismatched bases. It differs also from localized conversion. It appears that it is a process that evolved to correct errors of replication which lead to long heterologies and which are not eliminated by other systems...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{cortical}} {{endoplasmic reticulum}} (ER) is an intricate network of tubules and cisternae tightly {{associated with the}} plasma membrane (PM) in plants, yeast, and the excitable cell types in metazoans [1 – 5]. How the ER {{is attached to the}} cell cortex and what necessitates its highly reticulated architecture remain largely unknown. Here, we identify the integral ER vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins (VAPs), previously shown to control the composition of phosphoinositides at the ER-PM contact sites [6, 7], as major players in sustaining the ER-PM tethering in fission yeast. We show that <b>genetic</b> <b>conversion</b> of the reticulated ER structure to the cisternal morphology shields large areas of the PM, preventing the actomyosin division ring assembly at the equatorial cortex. Using a combination of VAP mutants where the cortical ER is detached from the PM and a set of artificial ER-PM tethers suppressing this phenotype, we demonstrate that the PM footprint of the cortical ER is functionally insulated from the cytosol. In cells with prominent ER-PM contacts, fine reticulation of the ER network may have emerged as a critical adaptation enabling a uniform access of peripheral protein complexes to the inner surface of the plasma membrane...|$|E
40|$|Poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) {{produces}} sec-ondary metabolites, {{which have}} {{important roles in}} self-defence processes – alkaloids (Szabo et al. 2003). Pothier and Goland (2005) described as major alkaloids contained in poppy morphine, codeine, thebaine, papaverine, narcotine (noscap-ine). Poppy capsules with a high alkaloid content are of great importance to the pharmaceutical industry (Szucs et al. 2002). On the contrary, a mutation-breeding programme using γ-rays and ethyl methane sulphonate was carried out for <b>genetic</b> <b>conversion</b> of narcotic opium poppy into non-narcotic seed poppy (Sharma et al. 1999). Poppy, despite the low Cd concentrations in the soil, reaches the highest Cd concentrations in the seeds (Chizzola 1997). Chizzola et al. (2003), Tlustoš et al. (1997) and Pavlíková et al. (1997) confirmed a high tendency of the poppy to ac-cumulate heavy metals, above all Cd and Pb and also semi-metal arsenic. As Pavlíková et al. (1997) found, spraying of poppy during the growing sea-son by potassium humate resulted in a significant growth of Cd and Zn contents in the plant. The concentration of alkaloids in capsules is affected by many factors. Kadar et al. (2001) reported an increase of alkaloids in capsules {{as the result of}} N fertilisation, while it generally decreased following P fertilisation. Also irregular stress effects change the alkaloid content of poppies. Szabo et al. (2003) observed that drought stress resulted in higher levels of the alkaloids whereas mycotoxin stress did not result in significant differences. As reported by Morimoto et al. (2001), in response to stress, morphine is quickly metabolised to bismorphine consisting of two morphine units.

The well characterised {{immunogenicity}} and genetic diversity associated with E. maxima promote its use in genetics-led studies on avian coccidiosis. The development of a genetic map for E. maxima, presented here based upon 647 amplified fragment length polymorphism markers typed from 22 clonal hybrid lines and assembled into 13 major linkage groups, is a major new resource for work with this parasite. Comparison with genetic maps produced for other coccidial parasites indicates relatively high levels of <b>genetic</b> recombination. <b>Conversion</b> of ∼ 14 % of the markers representing the major linkage groups to sequence characterised amplified region markers can provide a scaffold for the assembly of future genomic sequences as well as providing a foundation for more detailed genetic maps. Comparison with the Eimeria tenella genetic map produced 10 years ago has revealed a less biased marker distribution, with no more than nine markers mapped within any unresolved heritable unit. Nonetheless, preliminary bioinformatic characterisation of the three largest publicly available genomic E. maxima sequences suggest that the feature-poor/feature-rich structure which has previously been found to define the first sequenced E. tenella chromosome also defines the E. maxima genome. The significance of such a segmented genome and the apparent potential for variation in genetic recombination will be relevant to haplotype stability and the longevity of future anticoccidial strategies based upon multiple loci targeted by novel chemotherapeutic drugs or recombinant subunit vaccines...|$|R
40|$|Codon bias is the non-randomuse of synonymous codons, a {{phenomenon}} that has been observed in species as diverse as bacteria, plants and mammals. The preferential use of particular synonymous codons may reflect neutral mechanisms (e. g. mutational bias, G|C-biased gene <b>conversion,</b> <b>genetic</b> drift) and/or selection for mRNA stability, translational efficiency and accuracy. The {{extent to which these}} different factors influence codon usage is unknown, so we dissected the contribution of mu-tational bias and selection towards codon bias in genes from 15 eudicots, 4 monocots and 2 mosses. We analysed the frequency of mononucleotides, dinucleotides and trinucleotides and investigated whether the compositional genomic background could account for the observed codon usage pro-files. Neutral forces such asmutational pressure andG|C-biased gene conversion appeared to under-lie most of the observed codon bias, although there was also evidence for the selection of optimal translational efficiency and mRNA folding.

We developed a set of ultra-high-risk criteria for bipolar disorder [bipolar at-risk (BAR) ]. The primary aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the predictive validity of the BAR criteria. MethodsThis was a 12 -month prospective study that was conducted at Orygen Youth Health Clinical Program, a public mental health program for young people aged 15 – 24 years in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. At intake, BAR screen-positive individuals and a matched group of individuals who did not meet BAR criteria were observed over a period of 12 months. The BAR criteria include general criteria such as being in the peak age range for the onset of the disorder, as well as sub-threshold mania, depression plus cyclothymic features, and depression plus <b>genetic</b> risk. <b>Conversion</b> to first-episode mania/hypomania was defined by the presence of DSM-IV manic symptoms for more than four days, in line with the DSM-IV definition of hypomania/mania. ResultsA total of 559 help-seeking patients were screened. Of the eligible participants, 59 (10. 6 %) met BAR criteria. Thirty-five participants were included in the BAR group and 35 matched participants were selected to be in the control group. During the follow-up, five BAR patients out of 35 (14. 3 %) converted to first-episode hypomania/mania as opposed to none in the non-BAR group [χ 2 (1) = 5. 38, p = 0. 020]. Four out of these five converters had a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. ConclusionsThese findings support the possibility of identification of persons prior to the onset of mania/hypomania.

40|$|AbstractPreviously, we {{reported}} {{the phenomenon of}} genome diversification in Salmonella typhimurium LT 7, i. e., individual strains derived from LT 7 kept changing the genome structure by inversions, translocations, duplications, and mutations. To elucidate the genetic basis, we sequenced selected genes of the mismatch repair (MMR) system for correlations between MMR defects and genome diversification. We chose S. typhimurium LT 7 mutants 8111 F 2 and 9052 D 1 for mut gene sequence analyses and found that both mutants had a deletion of one of three tandem 6 -bp repeats, GCTGGC GCTGGC GCTGGC, within mutL, which was designated 6  bpΔmutL. mutS and mutH genes were unchanged in the mutants analyzed. Some sublines of 8111 F 2 and 9052 D 1 spontaneously stopped the genome diversification process at certain stages during single-colony restreaking passages, and in these strains the 6  bpΔmutL genotype also became wild-type mutL. We conclude that conversion between mutL and 6  bpΔmutL occurs spontaneously and that transient defects of mutL facilitate genome diversification without leading to the accumulation of multiple detrimental <b>genetic</b> changes.

To examine the similarities and differences in WM connectivity between those at-risk for and in early stages of SZ, a cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging study of 48 individuals diagnosed with first-episode SZ (FE-SZ), 37 nonpsychotic individuals at a high genetic risk of SZ (GHR-SZ), and 67 healthy controls (HC) was conducted. Decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the corpus callosum (CC), anterior cingulum (AC), and uncinate fasciculus (UF) was observed in both the GHR-SZ and FE-SZ groups, while decreased FAs in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and the fornix were only seen in the FE-SZ participants. Additionally, both GHR-SZ and FE-SZ showed worse executive performance than HC. The left SLF III FA was significantly positively correlated with hallucinations, and right SLF II was positively correlated with thought disorder. The presence of shared WM deficits in both FE-SZ and GHR-SZ individuals may reflect the genetic liability to SZ, while the disparate FA changes in the FE-SZ group may represent symptom-generating circuitry that mediates perceptual and cognitive disturbances of SZ and ultimately culminates in the onset of psychotic episodes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the bachelor’s thesis of Curtis Kendall Madsen {{which can be}} broken down into the following three goals. The first goal of this project is to develop a way to convert genetic networks into logical models. Once this is done, finding the state graph of these nets and performing Markov chain analysis on them can provide researchers with insight into the reachability of the states in the original network. Therefore, the second goal of this project is to develop an automated tool that can perform state space exploration of a logical model, and the third goal is to implement a Markov chain analyzer for the stage graph. For the logical representation of <b>genetic</b> networks, the <b>conversion</b> method uses labeled hybrid Petri nets (LHPNs) because they are designed for modeling logic while still allowing for important information required by Markov chain analysis such as transition rates {{to be included in the}} model. This conversion method is automated and is integrated into the iBioSim program allowing users to transform a Genetic Circuit Model (GCM) into an LHPN with just a click of a button. Also, iBioSim now includes the LHPN file type in its file tree so users can view and edit LHPNs once conversion is complete.

40|$|Genomic or {{detailed}} {{genetic data}} are now increasingly available for both model and non-model organisms, {{and this is}} allowing researchers to investigate the role that different forces play in shaping the evolution of species’ genomes. In this thesis I use large genetic and genomic datasets to attempt to quantify the action of natural selection and other forces on patterns of genetic polymorphism, differentiation and divergence in the natural world. These other forces include mutation, GC-biased gene <b>conversion,</b> <b>genetic</b> drift, and demography. Some of these forces act {{in the same direction}} in terms of their effect on the composition of genomes, and therefore the action of one may confound the detection of the action of others.

Where possible, I incorporate the effects of demography into these analyses. In the three main chapters that follow, I investigate 1) the forces that affect genetic differentiation between two populations of Drosophila melanogaster; 2) the forces underlying a naturally occurring colour polymorphism in the Australian finch Erythrura gouldiae; and 3) the forces which affect evolution at 4 -fold degenerate sites in ancestral populations of D. melanogaster and D. simulans...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of sexual reproduction {{is difficult to}} explain because the 2 -fold cost of meiosis requires a compensatory 2 -fold advantage {{that is difficult to}} prove. Here, I show that asexual reproduction has a short-term disadvantage due to the loss of complementation of recessive deleterious mutations, which can overcome the 2 -fold cost of meiosis in one or few generations. This complementation hypothesis can also explain why most asexual species are polyploid, why only certain types of asexual reproduction exist, why meiosis is not one-step, and the origin of amphimixis. I also show that the promotion of variation by recombination is not necessary to explain the evolution of amphimixis. Instead, recombination can be the result of an intragenomic conflict between alleles that induce the initiation of crossing over and alleles that evolve to resist that initiation. Thus recombination does not require any advantage at the individual or population level.

In Australia, however, robotic surgery has only been established in urologic and cardiac surgery. In 2008, the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) was the first public hospital to initiate a robotic surgery program in gynaecology and gynaecological oncology in Australia. Aims: To evaluate the feasibility and outcome of the robotic surgery program in gynaecology and gynaecological oncology at the RAH. Methods: A prospective case series analysis of the first 71 patients operated by robotic surgery from August 2008 to May 2010 was performed. Results: All patients underwent a total or radical robotic hysterectomy with or without staging for gynaecological cancer, benign disease or <b>genetic</b> risk. No <b>conversions</b> to laparotomy were required. Sixty-seven patients (95 %) were discharged the morning after surgery. Four patients (5 %) required hospital stays of up to 3 days because of pre-existing medical conditions or logistical reasons. The only major postoperative complication was one vault dehiscence. Minor short-term problems in four patients were vaginal cuff cellulitis, vaginal vault granulation tissue and infected port sites. Conclusion: The RAH experience is that robotic surgery in gynaecology and gynaecological oncology is safe and feasible. Patient recovery is excellent, and the hospital stay is reduced. Robotic surgery has the potential to significantly expand the minimally invasive surgical options for women undergoing surgery for benign and malignant gynaecological disease in Australia. Martin K.

In addition to the characterized glycosyl hydrolase family 11 (GH 11) endoxylanase designated XynA, B. subtilis 168 secretes a second endoxy-lanase as the translated product of the ynfF gene. This sequence shows remarkable homology to the GH 5 endoxylanase secreted by strains of Erwinia chrysanthemi. To determine its properties and potential role in the depolymerization of MeGAXn, the ynfF gene was cloned and overexpressed to provide an endoxylanase, designated XynC, which was characterized with respect to substrate preference, kinetic properties, and product formation. With different sources of MeGAXn as the substrate, the specific activity increased with increasing methylglucuronosyl substitutions on the - 1, 4 -xylan chain. With MeGAXn from sweetgum as a preferred substrate, XynC exhibited a Vmax of 59. 9 units/mg XynC, a Km of 1. 63 mg MeGAXn/ml, and a kcat of 2, 635 /minute at pH 6. 0 and 37 °C. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization—time of flight mass spectrom-etry and 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance data revealed that each hydrolysis product has a single glucuronosyl substitution penultimate to the reducing terminal xylose.

Several technical hurdles impinge upon the economic feasibility of this strategy, including the development of energy crops amenable to facile deconstruction. Reliable assays to characterize feedstock quality are needed to measure the effects of pre-treatment and processing and of the plant and microbial genetic diversity that influence bioconversion efficiency. Results We used the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans to develop a robust assay for biomass digestibility and conversion to biofuels.

The assay detected significant differences in the supernatant ethanol from wildtype sorghum compared with brown midrib sorghum mutants previously shown to be highly digestible.

In order to capitalize on the potential of lignocellulosic biofuels, the genes underlying natural <b>genetic</b> variation for <b>conversion</b> efficiency must be determined. We have developed a robust and high-throughput assay to measure feedstock quality using the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans. We have measured biomass accumulation phenotypes and utilized this assay to perform quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the model grass species Brachypodium distachyon. We detected four biomass accumulation QTLs and one bioconversion QTL, BIOFUEL 1 (BFL 1). We additionally found four significant total biomass accumulation marker-trait associations (MTAs) and two bioconversion MTAs within our GWAS. We developed near-isogenic lines and confirmed the effect of the BFL 1 QTL and provide evidence that Bradi 2 g 01480, a glucosyltransferase belonging to CaZY family 61 is the current best candidate for underling this QTL. Additionally, we have performed whole-genome resequencing on a total of 42 B. distachyon accessions at an average coverage of 72 x to accelerate candidate gene discovery. These accessions will join the growing genetic resources for B. distachyon, enabling even more robust association studies in the future. The discovery of genomic regions significantly associated with biomass accumulation and conversion phenotypes should enable more rapid gene discovery.

40|$|Homologous {{recombination}} (HR) is an evolutionarily conserved {{process that}} plays {{a pivotal role}} in the equilibrium between genetic stability and diversity. HR is commonly considered to be error-free, but several studies have shown that HR can be error-prone. Here, we discuss the actual accuracy of HR. First, we present the product of <b>genetic</b> exchanges (gene <b>conversion,</b> GC, and crossing over, CO) and the mechanisms of HR during double strand break repair and replication restart. We discuss the intrinsic capacities of HR to generate genome rearrangements by GC or CO, either during DSB repair or replication restart. During this process, abortive HR intermediates generate genetic instability and cell toxicity. In addition to genome rearrangements, HR also primes error-prone DNA synthesis and favors mutagenesis on single stranded DNA, a key DNA intermediate during the HR process. The fact that cells have developed several mechanisms protecting against HR excess emphasize its potential risks. Consistent with this duality, several pro-oncogenic situations have been consistently associated with either decreased or increased HR levels. Nevertheless, this versatility also has advantages that we outline here. We conclude that HR is a double-edged sword, which on one hand controls the equilibrium between genome stability and diversity but, on the other hand, can jeopardize the maintenance of genomic integrity. Therefore, whether non-homologous end joining (which, in contrast with HR, is not intrinsically mutagenic) or HR is the more mutagenic process is a question that should be re-evaluated. Both processes can be Dr. Jekyll in maintaining genome stability/variability and Mr. Hyde in jeopardizing genome integrity...|$|R

While germ-line gene conversion has {{been implicated in}} the pathogenesis of some diseases, somatic gene conversion has remained technically difficult to investigate on a large scale. Methods A novel analysis technique is proposed for detecting the signature of somatic gene conversion from SNP microarray data. The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium has gathered SNP microarray data for two control populations and cohorts for bipolar disorder (BD), cardiovascular disease (CAD), Crohn's disease (CD), hypertension (HT), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type- 1 diabetes (T 1 D) and type- 2 diabetes (T 2 D). Using the new analysis technique, the seven disease cohorts are analyzed to identify cohort-specific SNPs at which conversion is predicted. The quality of the predictions is assessed by identifying known disease associations for genes in the homologous duplicons, and comparing the frequency of such associations with background rates. Results Of 28 disease/locus pairs meeting stringent conditions, 22 show various degrees of disease association, compared with only 8 of 70 in a mock study designed to measure the background association rate (P - 9). Additional candidate genes are identified using less stringent filtering conditions. In some cases, somatic deletions appear likely. RA has a distinctive pattern of events relative to other diseases. Similarities in patterns are apparent between BD and HT.

The quality of the predictions is assessed by identifying known disease associations for genes in the homologous duplicons, and comparing the frequency of such associations with background rates. Results: Of 28 disease/locus pairs meeting stringent conditions, 22 show various degrees of disease association, compared with only 8 of 70 in a mock study designed to measure the background association rate (P < 10 - 9). Additional candidate genes are identified using less stringent filtering conditions. In some cases, somatic deletions appear likely. RA has a distinctive pattern of events relative to other diseases. Similarities in patterns are apparent between BD and HT. Conclusions: The associations derived represent the first evidence that somatic gene conversion could be a significant causative factor {{in each of the}} seven diseases. The specific genes provide potential insights about disease mechanisms, and are strong candidates for further study...|$|R
40|$|Background: There is {{currently}} considerable {{interest in developing}} renewable sources of energy. One strategy is the biological conversion of plant biomass to liquid transportation fuel. Several technical hurdles impinge upon the economic feasibility of this strategy, including the development of energy crops amenable to facile deconstruction. Reliable assays to characterize feedstock quality are needed to measure the effects of pre-treatment and processing and of the plant and microbial genetic diversity that influence bioconversion efficiency. Results: We used the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans to develop a robust assay for biomass digestibility and conversion to biofuels. The assay utilizes {{the ability of the}} microbe to convert biomass directly into ethanol with little or no pre-treatment. Plant samples were added to an anaerobic minimal medium and inoculated with C. phytofermentans, incubated for 3 days, after which the culture supernatant was analyzed for ethanol concentration. The assay detected significant differences in the supernatant ethanol from wild-type sorghum compared with brown midrib sorghum mutants previously shown to be highly digestible. Compositional analysis of the biomass before and after inoculation suggested that differences in xylan metabolism were partly responsible for the differences in ethanol yields. Additionally, we characterized the natural <b>genetic</b> variation for <b>conversion</b> efficiency in Brachypodium distachyon and shrub willow (Salix spp.). Conclusion: Our results agree with those from previous studies of lignin mutants using enzymatic saccharification based approaches. However, the use of C. phytofermentans takes into consideration specific organismal interactions, which will be crucial for simultaneous saccharification fermentation or consolidated bioprocessing. The ability to detect such phenotypic variation facilitates the genetic analysis of mechanisms underlying plant feedstock quality...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} role of {{nucleotide}} excision repair in the induction of intrachromosomal homologous recombination in mammalian cells, we introduced a plasmid containing a substrate for recombination into three human cell lines that differ in their repair capacity and compared the frequency of recombination induced by UV radiation and by 1 -nitrosopyrene. One strain had a normal capacity for nucleotide excision repair, the second exhibited an intermediate rate of repair, and the third, derived from a patient with xeroderma pigmentosum, had no ability to repair UV- or 1 -nitrosopyrene-induced DNA damage. The endogenous thymidine kinase genes in these cell strains had been inactivated, and the cells contained an integrated copy of a plasmid carrying duplicated copies of the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (Htk) gene, each inactivated by an 8 -base-pair XhoI site inserted at a unique site. A functional tk gene can only be generated by a productive recombination event between the two Htk genes. In all three stains, UV and 1 -nitrosopyrene induced dose-dependent increases {{in the frequency of}} recombinants. However, the doses required to cause a specific increase in recombination in the repair-deficient strains were 10 to 30 times lower than the dose required for the cell strain with a normal capacity for repair. These results strongly suggest that unexcised DNA lesions, rather than excision repair per se, stimulate intrachromosomal homologous recombination. Southern blot analysis of DNA from representative recombinants indicated that in all cases one of the two Htk genes had become wild type (XhoI resistant). The majority (90 %) retained the Htk duplication, consistent with nonreciprocal transfer of <b>genetic</b> information (gene <b>conversion)</b> ...|$|R

Methods: In this prospective longitudinal study of 2765 individuals, 777 subjects progressed to neovascular disease (NV) or geographic atrophy (GA) in either eye over 12 years. Recently reported genetic loci were assessed for their independent effects on incident advanced AMD after controlling for 6 established loci in 5 genes, and demographic, behavioral, and macular characteristics. New variants which remained significantly related to progression were then added to a final multivariate model to assess their independent effects. The contribution of genes to risk models was assessed using reclassification tables by determining risk within cross-classified quintiles for alternative models. Results: Three new genetic variants {{were significantly related to}} progression: rare variant R 1210 C in CFH (hazard ratio (HR) 2. 5, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 2 – 5. 3, P = 0. 01), and common variants in genes COL 8 A 1 (HR 2. 0, 95 % CI 1. 1 – 3. 5, P = 0. 02) and RAD 51 B (HR 0. 8, 95 % CI 0. 60 – 0. 97, P = 0. 03).

40|$|The {{ability of}} a series of DNA-damaging agents to induce {{homologous}} intrachromosomal recombination between duplicated genes in the chromosome of mouse cells was investigated. The target cells were the thymidine kinase-deficient mouse L-cell strain 333 M, which contains a single integrated copy of a plasmid with two herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Htk) genes, each containing an 8 -base-pair XhoI linker inserted at a unique site. Expression of a functional Htk enzyme requires a productive recombinational event between the two nonfunctional genes. The spontaneous rate of recombination in this strain is 3 per 10 (6) cells per generation. The agents tested represent physical carcinogens (UV and ionizing radiation), a simple alkylating agent (N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine), an alkylating cross-linking agent (mitomycin C), and a reactive metabolite of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ((+/-) - 7 beta, 8 alpha-dihydroxy- 9 alpha, 10 alpha-epoxy- 7, 8, 9, 10 - tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene [BPDE]). The background frequency of tk+ recombinants in the untreated population averaged 18 X 10 (- 6) +/- 5 X 10 (- 6). Ionizing radiation had little or no effect on recombination; exposure to mitomycin C, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, BPDE, or UV, at doses that lowered the survival to between 90 and 10 % of the control, caused a dose-dependent increase in frequency of recombinants, reaching 50 X 10 (- 6) to 100 X 10 (- 6). No tk+ cells could be generated with a control cell line that contained only one mutant copy of the Htk gene. Molecular hybridization analysis showed that 85 to 90 % of the tk+ recombinants retained the Htk gene duplication, consistent with nonreciprocal transfer of wild-type <b>genetic</b> information, gene <b>conversion.</b> In the rest, only a single copy of the Htk gene remained, reflecting a single reciprocal exchange within a chromatid or a single unequal exchange between sister chromatids. Each recombinant tested contained an XhoI-resistant (wild-type) Htk gene...|$|R

40|$|Double-stranded DNA breaks are {{potentially}} lethal lesions {{that can be}} repaired in mitotic cells by either homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end- joining (NHEJ) pathways. In the HR pathway, the broken DNA molecule is repaired using either the sister chromatid or the homolog as a template. Mitotic recombination events involving the homolog often result in loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of markers located distal to the crossover. In humans that are heterozygous for a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene, mitotic recombination leading to LOH can be an early step in cancer development. In my thesis research, I analyzed mitotic recombination in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using oligonucleotide-containing microarrays to detect LOH of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In analyzing cells treated with ionizing radiation, I performed the first whole-genome analysis of LOH events done in any organism (Chapter 2). I showed that irradiated cells had between two and three unselected LOH events. I also showed that crossovers were often associated with non- reciprocal exchanges of <b>genetic</b> information (gene <b>conversion</b> events) and that these conversion events were more complex than predicted by standard models of homologous recombination. In Chapter 3, I describe my mapping of spontaneous crossovers in a 1. 1 Mb region of yeast chromosome IV. This analysis is the first high-resolution mitotic recombination map of a substantial fraction (about 10 %) of a eukaryotic genome. I demonstrated the existence of recombination "hotspots" and showed {{that some of these}} hotspots were homolog-specific. Two of the strongest hotspots were formed by closely- spaced inverted repeats of retrotransposons. I demonstrated that the hotspot activity was a consequence of a secondary DNA structure formed by these repeats. Additionally, the majority of spontaneous LOH events reflect DNA lesions induced in unreplicated chromosomes during G 1 of the cell cycle, indicating that G 1 -initiated lesions threaten genome stability more than G 2 -initiated lesions. In Chapter 4, I describe mitotic crossovers associated with DNA replication stress induced by hydroxyurea (HU) treatment. Surprisingly, most HU-induced crossovers had conversion tracts indicative of DNA lesions initiated in G 1. Additionally, HU- induced recombination events were very significantly associated with solo delta elements, a 330 bp sequence that is repeated several hundred times in the yeast genome.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 66 - 77). Genes {{within the}} Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) of vertebrates code for proteins {{that are involved}} in antigen recognition and activation of the adaptive immune response. The hallmark of the MHC is the extremely high levels of polymorphism found at loci. A diverse array of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the generation and maintenance of diversity at MHC loci, including the processes of gene <b>conversion,</b> <b>genetic</b> drift and selection; in the presence of many pathogens balancing selection is thought to be the dominant mechanism by which selection operates. Amino acid substitutions within the peptide-binding region (PBR) of MHC genes further supports the hypothesis that positive selection enhances amino acid diversity in the PBR, such that natural selection will favour PBR diversity in natural populations. This study investigated mechanisms that shape genetic diversity of MHC class II genes in a natural population of the Nile crocodile, Crocodylus niloticus. Using PCR-cloning-sequencing methodology, allelic diversity at MHC Class II genes was investigated and provides evidence for at least two Class II 13 gene families in the Nile crocodile. The Crni-OAB family is homologous to classical Class II vertebrate genes; high levels of both allelic and amino acid diversity characterise this gene family and a strong signal of balancing selection acts to maintain functional diversity. The second family, Crni-OBB, most likely represents a non-classical Class II locus in crocodiles and was characterized by reduced levels of diversity. Analysis suggests that Crni-OBB loci have evolved in a divergent manner to those of the Crni-OAB as balancing selection was not detected within the putative PBR. Results from this study suggest that duplication followed by a recombination event has most likely {{led to the formation of}} two distinct crocodilian Class II 13 gene families. Secondly, the relative contributions of balancing selection and random genetic drift in the evolution of extant MHC diversity are examined in a natural population of the Nile crocodile. Temporal variation in allele frequencies for MHC and microsatellite loci was assessed in four successive cohorts of crocodiles from the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Results from this study suggest that a combination of short-term neutral forces such as random genetic drift, together with longer-term selection influence variation at Class II loci in the Okavango Nile crocodile. Loci within the MHC of the Nile crocodile appear to be evolving within a dynamic framework of selection, random genetic drift and recombination. This study is the first of its kind to investigate the respective influence of demography and selection on allele frequencies in a natural population of crocodilians...|$|R
