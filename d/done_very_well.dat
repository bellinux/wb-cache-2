5|$|Hockey is Canada's {{national}} winter sport, and Canadians {{are extremely}} {{passionate about the}} game. The nation has traditionally <b>done</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> at the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union competed in its first World Championship in 1954, defeating Canada and winning the gold medal. At the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, the Soviet team went undefeated and won its first gold medal. Canada's team lost to the Soviets and the United States in the medal round, winning the bronze. The 1960 Winter Olympics, in Squaw Valley, United States, saw the first, and to date only, team from Australia compete in the tournament. Canada, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Sweden were the top four teams heading into the Games, but were all defeated by the American team, which won all seven games en route to its first Olympic gold medal. Canada won the silver medal and the Soviet Union won the bronze.|$|E
5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's <b>done</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E
25|$|Castleford {{where the}} winner would reach the final. 3,000 people turned up to first see Thompson score a penalty after 15 minutes, but then Nigere Tariu slid over {{to put the}} Islanders ahead. Just before the break however, Tait charged through three players to put Scotland back in the game. In the second half the Cook Islands, with several NRL players in their ranks, showed their {{strength}} as Sonny Shepherd scored a controversial try as Scottish players complained about the grounding. From a play the ball Shepherd went over again and in the 73rd minute Tariu scored a converted try. The Bravehearts did get a late consolation, skipper Tait going over for Scotland's last try before Islander Ali Davys sealed Scotland's fate with a drop-goal. The match finished Scotland 10–21 Cook Islands. In the final the Cook Islands beat Ireland 22–6 in Bury to win the tournament and secure {{a place in the}} next World Cup. Despite losing this final match the Scotland team and supporters thought that they had <b>done</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> considering how young the team was and how well their performances had been against Russia and the USA.|$|E

25|$|The 1930s were {{to herald}} {{a new era}} for the team as it emerged at times {{as one of the}} {{dominant}} sides in world rugby league. In 1930 and 1933 Wales played Australia at Wembley Stadium in London. On both occasions they failed to win, losing 26–10 and being thrashed 51–19. However at the time Australia were arguably considered the world's second best nation (behind England) and so particularly in the first game, Wales had <b>done</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> against the touring Kangaroos. Wales luck against England did not change either suffering three losses to the Lions in three games, in Huddersfield, Salford and Leeds. They were very unlucky in the latter however, with England winning 14 points to 13. Exactly 27 years after Wales played their first match, they played France {{for the first time in}} a new competition called the European Nations Cup, in which Wales, France and England would play two matches each. Wales and France kicked off the tournament on New Year's Day in front of 15,000 in Bordeaux. But the Dragons lost 18–11, and their match against England was just as bad losing 24–11 in Liverpool. The France versus England match finished a 15–15 draw so England won the inaugural competition on points difference. Wales finished bottom. The next European Nations Cup brought better fortunes to the Welsh and they kicked off the competition, which was staged across Winter 1935 and 1936, with a 41–7 thrashing against France. The team were cheered on by 25,000 people at Llanelli and three months later Wales did the unexpected and squeezed past England, winning 14–17 away at Hull. This was a huge result for Wales, having not beaten England since 1923, and they had won the cup for the first time. For the next two competitions Wales successfully defended the cup. A 3–2 win against the English in Pontypridd, coupled with a 9–3 victory in Paris saw Wales clinch the cup for the second time, and then in 1938 the Dragons beat England again by one point in Bradford before beating the French 18–2. This represents perhaps the highest point in Welsh rugby league history with great players such as Jim Sullivan, Gus Risman, Alan Edwards and Alec Givvons featuring. In 1935 Welsh rugby league would produce its first black international in George Bennett (some 48 years before Welsh rugby union would do so). In the 1938/1939 tournament, the last to be held for six years because of the Second World War, Wales beat their main rivals England before dramatically losing 16–10 in Bordeaux against Les Tricolores. Because of the French's victory against England, Wales finished second and the cup was taken across the channel.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{observed}} 12 Monkeys {{depiction of}} the future, finding similarities with Blade Runner (1982; also scripted by David Peoples) and Brazil (1985; also directed by Terry Gilliam). [...] "The film is a celebration of madness and doom, with a hero who tries to prevail against the chaos of his condition, and is inadequate", Ebert wrote. [...] "This vision is a cold, dark, damp one, and even the romance between Willis and Stowe feels desperate rather than joyous. All of this is <b>done</b> <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> {{and the more you}} know about movies (especially the technical side), the more you're likely to admire it. And as entertainment, it appeals more to the mind than to the senses." ...|$|E

If I go out in the madness of greyscale, then I'll have thought I've <b>done</b> <b>very</b> <b>well.</b> It's been a complete treat to be a part of the show. They're a lovely group of people. But the greyscale has definitely got this actor worried, I'll be honest about that." ...|$|E

GamesRadar praised {{the idea of the}} film, stating that if produced it would be [...] "the best movie since Piranha 3D" [...] and calling it [...] "good enough for grown-ups". In a further discussion via their Pokémon Monday cast, the three editors involved praised the film as [...] "very well done". While one editor stated disdain for the appearance of the various Pokémon in the film, they agreed that in any live-action adaptation the creatures would [...] "always look weird", and that for a film with a lack of budget they were <b>done</b> <b>very</b> <b>well.</b> They also praised the attention of detail, and praised David Quast's portrayal of Giovanni, as well as the presentation of recurring anime villains Jessie, James and Meowth. Editor Carolyn Gudmundson added that she was uncomfortable with the grittiness of the production, though praised it for presenting out the inherent problem of the concept behind the games and its similarity to dog fighting.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} positive {{reviews in}} trade publications. The Moving Picture World review said. [...] "Probably {{the story of}} Rip Van Winkle as told by Washington Irving {{will always be a}} delight. Surely the Rip Van Winkle, as depicted by the late Joseph Jefferson, will linger long in the memory of those fortunate enough to have seen it. Unquestionably, however, the third in the list of delights is this film from Thanhouser which tells the story over again {{in much the same way}} that Jefferson told it. The Rip of Jefferson and the Rip of Irving are two different versions, though both do substantially the same things. ... It is a good piece of work from every standpoint. The actors have entered into the spirit of the story and have depicted it with close adherence to the facts as they are related in the original. The stage manager understood what was required to make the background appear natural, while the photographer handled the camera with full knowledge of the requirements." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer also agreed and commended the film by stating, [...] "The Thanhouser Company has <b>done</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> with this old legend, paying particular attention to details. ... The acting is exceptionally good for a story representing that era of time, and the adaption is very clear to the spectator." ...|$|E

Hockey is Canada's {{national}} winter sport, and Canadians are extremely passionate about the game. The nation has traditionally <b>done</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> at the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the Soviet Union. The USSR won all but two gold medals from 1956 to 1988 {{as well as a}} final time as the Unified Team at the 1992 Albertville Olympics. The United States won their first gold medal in 1960. On the way to winning the gold medal at the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics amateur US college players defeated the heavily favoured Soviet squad—an event known as the [...] "Miracle on Ice" [...] in the United States. Restrictions on professional players were fully dropped at the 1998 games in Nagano. The Games saw the full participation of players from the NHL, which suspended operations during the Games and has done so in subsequent Games. The 2010 games in Vancouver were the first played in an NHL city since the inclusion of NHL players. The 2010 games were the first played on NHL-sized ice rinks, which are narrower than the IIHF standard.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the recent}} Beatles Anthology having {{introduced}} {{the group to}} newer and younger fans, it was reasoned that Starr would benefit from the exposure; McCartney's Flaming Pie had <b>done</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> upon its 1997 release. With Starr newly signed to a worldwide major label deal with Mercury, he was hoping for a similar reaction. On 1 June, radio stations were sent promotional copies of the single. A radio special, on 15 June, premiered the album worldwide. Vertical Man was released on 16 June in the US, with [...] "La De Da" [...] released as a single on 20 July before being withdrawn a week later. It received average reviews and reached number 61 in the US. The album was then released in the UK on 3 August, where it bubbled below the official Top 75, reaching number 85 there, after having sold 2,000 copies. The album was originally to be titled Thanks for Comin, before being changed after looking through a book belonging to Barbara Bach's daughter, Francesca. The German version of the album included the bonus track [...] "Mr. Double-It-Up", while the Japanese edition contained [...] "Mr. Double-It-Up" [...] and [...] "Everyday". Within the album's week of release, Starr held an online chat with fans. Attendees at the Beatlefest convention who had pre-ordered the album were given a 7" [...] single of [...] "La De Da", which included a non-album track as the B-side.|$|E
2500|$|Jeremy Estes of PopMatters called Tatsumi's {{imagination}} [...] "dark and disturbing, {{but definitely}} worth the trip." [...] Esters added that Tatsumi's utilitarian art style and clean style of storytelling make the manga {{easy to follow}} visually, but its tone of despair can be overwhelming. Bill Randall of The Comics Journal described the manga's stories [...] "as subtle as pissing in someone's face", but acknowledged Tatsumi's place in manga history {{and the strength of}} his images. In a starred review, Publishers Weekly observed that Tatsumi tackles difficult subjects, but instead of exploiting, he humanizes his characters. It also called his art masterful in how he varies his style and depicts [...] "graceful motion, grisly suffering and complicated emotion." [...] Gordon Flagg of Booklist noted that the stories in the manga are more political than usual for Tatsumi in their portrayal of postwar Japan, saying of the manga: [...] "Tatsumi's mastery of the visual simplicity of classic manga gives a stark power to these devastating, uncompromising pieces." [...] Richard Rayner of the Los Angeles Times described the stories as [...] "remarkable, amazing" [...] saying that their style is [...] "spare, elliptical and it's sometimes necessary to read two or three times to appreciate the full nightmarish power." [...] Andrew Wheeler of ComicMix preferred the stories translated in Abandon the Old in Tokyo, but still found the stories [...] "Hell" [...] and the titular title to be comparable, calling the manga [...] "a stunning achievement, a collection of dark, realistic stories from a side of the world we rarely see." [...] Calling the manga bleak, Tom Baker of The Daily Yomiuri said that [...] "there's no point in reading such depressing stuff unless it is <b>done</b> <b>very</b> <b>well.</b> And Tatsumi does it excellently." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{first act}} of the Papen {{government}} was to dissolve the Reichstag {{in accordance with the}} [...] "gentlemen's agreement" [...] Schleicher had reached with Hitler on 4 June 1932. As the Nazis had <b>done</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> in Länder elections that spring in Oldenburg and Mecklenburg-Schwerin, winning nearly 50% of the vote in both elections, it was reasonably expected by all concerned that the dissolution of the Reichstag only two years into its four-year term would only benefit the National Socialists. As a presidential government, Papen ruled by Article 48, having his emergency decrees signed into law by President Hindenburg and did not seek to govern via the Reichstag. However, the Reichstag could by majority vote cancel any law passed by Article 48 within sixty days of it being signed into law and could pass a vote of no-confidence in the government, which meant that Papen like Brüning before him needed a friendly majority in the Reichstag. As Papen made no secret of his rabid hostility to the Social Democrats and the Zentrum hated him for his role in bringing down Brüning, it was unlikely that the Reichstag elected in 1930 would [...] "tolerate" [...] his government the same way it had the [...] Brüning government. [...] Papen called a national election for July 1932, {{in the hope that the}} Nazis would win the largest number of seats in the Reichstag, which would allow him the majority he needed to create a dictatorship. On 15 June 1932, the new government lifted the ban on the SA and the SS, who were secretly encouraged to indulge in as much violence as possible as Schleicher wanted mayhem on the streets to justify the new authoritarian regime he was creating.|$|E
