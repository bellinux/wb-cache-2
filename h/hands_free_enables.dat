40|$|Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is an {{emerging}} technology. Eye gaze technique {{is one of}} the very significant techniques of HCI and can be used as <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> pointing tool <b>enabling</b> hands-free operation of the display for the user. The important advantage in using eye gaze systems is that the user can communicate from a distance, and there is no requirement of physical contact with the computer. Investigation of eye gaze helps to understand various aspects of the user like attention, intention, desire and area of interest etc. The eye gaze detection techniques can be classified on the basis of direct eye detection, appearance, template, shape, feature, motion, hybrid, regression, 3 D methods etc. There are significant factors like shape and size of the object, distance from the subject, texture, light conditions, colour, orientation, head movement, calibration which may influence and affect th...|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} {{acoustic}} neuromas is usually unknown; however {{there is a}} growing body of evidence that sporadic defects in tumor suppressor genes may give rise to these tumors in some individuals. In particular, loss or mutation of a tumor suppressor gene on the long arm of chromosome 22 is strongly associated with vestibular schwannomas. Other studies have hinted at exposure to loud noise on a consistent basis. One study has shown a relationship between acoustic neuromas and prior exposure to head and neck radiation, and a concomitant history of having had a parathyroid adenoma (tumor found in proximity to the thyroid gland controlling calcium metabolism). There are even controversies on hand held cellular phones. Whether or not the radiofrequency radiation {{has anything to do with}} acoustic neuroma formation, remains to be seen. To date, no environmental factor (such as cell phones or diet) has been scientifically proven to cause these tumors. The Acoustic Neuroma Association (ANA) does recommend that frequent cellular phone users use a <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> device to <b>enable</b> separation of the device from the head.|$|R
50|$|The Nokia Lumia 735 was {{released}} in 2014, and runs the Windows 10 Mobile operating system as the software can be upgraded continuously. All variants of the Lumia 735 are upgradable to Windows 10 Mobile. Many long time users of the phone reported that certain apps like Here Maps and Here Drive have been phased out. As of September 18, 2016, purchasers of a new Nokia Lumia 735, along with Microsoft Insider participants to the Windows 10 mobile environment have reported technology enhancements and software changes creating a compelling handset. While the Here Maps App is missed, it is reported that the Microsoft Maps App is very similar, and works very well with outstanding map graphics. Users also report that both the camera and video capture modes include a 'Pro' function with a myriad of enhancements including HDR for the camera and editing abilities which also works very well with the latest upgrade. The Cortana voice assistant allows <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> voice <b>enabled</b> instructions for most every task including the <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> use of the Groove Music App. Microsoft Cloud enabled services are second to none and are integrated into the handset. The battery can be removed, and a 128gb capable mini SD slot is provided along with wireless charging capability. The outstanding software package of the Windows 10 mobile environment has allowed the classic Nokia Lumia 735 to become an outstanding performer considering the tasks Microsoft has placed on itself. With most new 2016 smartphones being overpriced, lacking the long term software upgrades along with gimmick features {{that none of us}} really need, The Nokia Lumia 735 has become the real deal, while overcoming the Wall Street smartphone hype that other smartphone manufacturers rely on. This while becoming an even better performer in its own right over time with consistent technology upgrades. The Nokia Lumia 735 is still a compelling value package two years on with excellent features and software integration,and will delight both fans of Nokia form and function, tech geeks and the above average smart phone user.|$|R
40|$|Smart {{wearable}} {{devices are}} integrated our everyday lives. Such wearable technology is worn {{on or near}} the body, while leaving both <b>hands</b> <b>free.</b> This <b>enables</b> users to receive and send information in a non-obtrusive way. Because of the ability to continuously assist and support activities, wearables could be of great value to persons with a disability. Persons with a disability can only benefit from the potential of wearables if they are accessible. Like other devices, platforms, and applications, developers of wearables need to take accessibility into account during early development, for example by including multimodal interfaces in the design. Even though some accessibility guidelines and standards exist for websites and mobile phones, more support for the development of accessible wearables is needed. The aim of our project is to develop a set of guidelines for accessible wearables. Three approaches are combined to develop the guidelines. A scan of the literature was done to identify publications addressing the accessibility of wearables and/or development guidelines. Semi-structured interviews were held with developers of accessible wearable technology. Based on these first activities, a draft set of guidelines is created. This draft is evaluated with developers and researchers in the field of universal design, accessibility, and wearables. Further, the draft is evaluated with visually impaired people (VIP) in interviews. Based on these results, a final set of guidelines will be created. This set is evaluated against an actual project in which apps are developed for VIP. This study is in progress; first results are presented (literature study, semi-structured interviews, first draft of guidelines) and a call for participation in the Delphi study is issue...|$|R

Annelies Labaere 1, Jan Vanderwegen 2, Frans Debruyne 1 1 Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium 2 Antwerp University Hospital, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Antwerp, Belgium Annelies. Labaere@uz. kuleuven. ac. be Objectives: The {{objective of this}} study was to make a qualitative comparison between tracheo-esophageal speech with manual stoma occlusion and <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> tracheo-esophageal speech with the Provox FreeHands device. Patients/Materials and Methods: Both Manual and handsfree tracheo-esophageal speech were compared in 13 patients who were regular users of Provox Freehands for at least four months. Evaluation of speech material consisted of objective analysis using the KayPentax CSL, perceptual ratings by a group of experienced listeners and patients own perceptual judgment. In addition, data concerning user-friendliness, additional values and inconveniences of the FreeHands device were gathered using questionnaires. The Voice Handicap Index (VHI) was used to evaluate the relation between voice related QOL and method of stoma occlusion. Therefore a control group of TE-speakers who did not use <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> speech, was selected. Results: Objective analysis revealed significant differences (p< 0. 05) for parameters fluency (i. e. the number of syllables produced on one intake of breath) and maximal phonation time, to the detriment of <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> speech. There were no significant differences found for the dynamic characteristics Perceptual judgements of running speech were rated higher in the manual occlusion condition for most patients, but there were interrater differences. Subjective impressions showed that the majority of patients preferred <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> speech to manual stoma occlusion, noticably for voice quality, fatigability, attractivity and feelings of self-confidence. Major inconveniences of <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> speech were a significantly decreased duration of sticker adhesion, the occurrence of disturbing noises and the need for continued effort. The VHI scores were significantly higher in the group of <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> speakers compared to the control group. Conclusions: This clinical study showed that in selected patients the Provox FreeHands shows important subjective benefits. Improvements however are necessary to make the device a useful rehabilitation device for a larger group of laryngectomized patients.

40|$|In Victoria, <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> wash <b>hand</b> basins in food {{preparation}} areas were a regulatory requirement introduced under the 1984 Health (Eating House and Food Premises) Regulations. The food safety standards introduced in January 2001 replace existing state, territory {{and local government}} food hygiene regulations {{and the provision of}} a <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> wash <b>hand</b> basin is no longer prescribed (Australia and New Zealand Food Authority 2001). The aim of the pilot study was to investigate the hypothesis that there is no difference between the effectiveness of <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> wash <b>hand</b> basins and manual tap operated basins in reducing microbial flora on hands. Thirteen premises with manual hand basins and a comparison random sample of 19 premises with <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> basins were selected from the City of Yarra in Melbourne, Australia. Data collection involved an Environmental Health Officer visiting the premises, conducting a survey and swabbing the food handler’s hands prior to and post washing. The impact of variables, including the temperature of water supplied to the wash hand basin, number of food handling employees, types of food handled, time the sample was taken and approximate number of meals sold per hour, were also investigated. The results indicated that the mean percentage {{reduction in the number of}} colonies compared for the manual and <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> basins showed no significant difference (Manual mean = 58 %, <b>Hands</b> <b>free</b> mean = 79 %, p = 0. 163). Overall, there was large variability in pre and post microbial counts for both basins and considerable variability in the temperature of water to wash hand basins. No clear association, however, was found between the number of employees, temperature of wash hand basin, meals served or use of either facility, with the percentage reduction in the microbial load. The pilot study has indicated that there is no difference between the use of either a manual or <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> wash <b>hand</b> basin for a small group of food retailers. Consideration should be given to a range of factors which might have impacted on this study, including frequency of hand washing, types of foods handled, length of mechanical wash, and number of manual wash hand basins available for the study. Education regarding the need to maintain the temperature of the wash hand basin water between 22 - 40 °C should also be investigated among food retailers as well as strategies for the correct washing of hands...|$|R
