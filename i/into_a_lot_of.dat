Adam LaClave stated the differing musical tastes of the band helped cultivate their sound: [...] "Each {{one of us is}} really <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> different things ... it helps make our sound because you can hear all kinds of things". Live performances were characterized by [...] sunglasses, futuristic costumes, and energetic showmanship. Many bands have influenced Earthsuit's style; the group has performed covers of songs by Basement Jaxx, Black Sheep, Kraftwerk, and The Talking Heads. They have also utilized samples by DJ Shadow and The Verve.|$|E

HOK Sport's {{project manager for}} the project, Melinda Lehman, said that the Rooney family asked for the stadium's design to [...] "acknowledge the history of Pittsburgh and also bring in an element of looking forward, this is where Pittsburgh is going." [...] In order to accomplish this, HOK Sport used steel structurally and externally. The stone used in Heinz Field's design is artificial, in order to decrease cost. Of the glass used in the stadium's design, Lehman said, [...] "The glass is a more modern building element, which ties <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the buildings in [...] Pittsburgh and gives great views of the surrounding areas." [...] The Steelers and Panthers have their own locker rooms, which differ in size based {{on the amount of}} players each team is permitted to dress for each game. The visitor facilities are modeled after the home locker rooms' design. As with its predecessor, Heinz Field's culinary service provider is Aramark; over 400eateries are located throughout the stadium. A bronze statue of Steelers founder Art Rooney, similar to those located outside PNC Park, was moved [...] from its previous position outside Three Rivers Stadium. In addition, a statue of a Pitt Panther over a paved depiction of Pitt's Cathedral of Learning was placed outside Gate A.

500|$|In February 2003, Case {{temporarily}} {{exited the}} show {{as a result of}} lengthy contract negotiations. Instead of having the character depart permanently (or be killed off), executive producer David Shaughnessy chose to have her leave town after issues with her marriage to Nick. While away, Sharon becomes suicidal; Case explained that Sharon's life had fallen apart and she left town to commit suicide, drinking herself into [...] "a complete stupor". Travelling to Denver, she meets (and has an affair with) businessman Cameron Kirsten (Linden Ashby), who physically abuses her. In April, Case signed a new contract with the show. Executive producer and head writer at the time John F. Smith said that upon Sharon's return to Genoa City, she wants to keep where she was a secret. That December, Sharon is horrified when Cameron arrives in town for apparent business with Newman Enterprises. Smith stated that the story with Cameron and Sharon would be one that [...] "builds quickly <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> drama". Explaining their relationship, Ashby revealed that Cameron and Sharon were [...] "kindred spirits" [...] and hooked up, but Cameron becomes abusive, with Ashby calling him [...] "really disturbing". Cameron blackmails Sharon into meeting him at a motel. When she arrives they have a physical altercation in which Sharon throws a bottle at him to keep him from raping her, [...] "killing" [...] him (or so she believes). Australian magazine TV Soap noted that [...] "sweet, demure" [...] Sharon had become a murderer. After driving around with his body in her car trunk for days, she dumps it in an alley. Sharon's former friend, Grace, returns to town; she discovers Cameron alive, and nurses him back to health. Detective Weber (Sherman Augustus) is suspicious of Sharon's involvement in Cameron's disappearance. Sharon begins [...] "hallucinating" [...] with visions of Cameron's [...] "ghost" [...] (which is actually him, alive). Case noted that Sharon was getting into deeper trouble by making mistakes [...] "trying to do the right thing".|$|E

[...] Although Fatboy is in love with Mercy, he does not believe that Mercy sees him as more than a friend and may call off the wedding if he tells her. He does not think of the consequences, such as imprisonment. Norwood revealed that Fatboy has known Mercy since they were nine years old and he had feelings for her when EastEnders: E20 started, as he was upset when she got pregnant by someone else. He said that Fatboy would be heartbroken when Mercy leaves. Norwood told Inside Soap that the wedding creates more problems for the characters, rather than solving all their problems. The fact that they try so hard to prove they are genuine makes it [...] "very hard for them to be friends." [...] The wedding episode sees Fatboy have a dream come true, {{but at the same time}} it is a nightmare for him. Knowing the wedding is a sham he is [...] "waiting for that monster to appear". Ashley turns up and is annoyed that Fatboy has kept the wedding a secret, and of this, Norwood stated: [...] "When [...] finds out what has happened he is pretty shocked. He tries to make Fatboy see the consequences of his actions, but Fatboy doesn't want to hear it—his dad has already betrayed him when it comes to Mercy." [...] Mercy is shocked to learn that Fatboy did not tell her that Ashley reported her. Although Norwood concluded that Fatboy [...] "will go to the ends of the earth to make this marriage work".|$|E

2500|$|... "With {{the release}} of Unexpected, Williams has welcomed R back into her arms with a modern edge, a la Rihanna and Chris Brown, infusing her soulful lyrics with party beats and dance-like synths. Take the lead single, for instance. [...] "We Break the Dawn" [...] is an immensely catchy mid-tempo jam co-written by Williams and ex-Child Beyonce's sister, Solange Knowles. The track re-launched the {{ebullient}} singer back into the mainstream, sporting a new, edgy electronica look and sound. [...] "We Break the Dawn" [...] has {{a certain amount of}} memorability in the synth riff and the laid-back party lyrics. The song is carefree, and {{a far cry from the}} depth of Gospel music. The album features a collection of [...] "moods" [...] including the bouncy tracks [...] "Hello Heartbreak," [...] hilariously including [...] "It's time for the percolator" [...] as the bridge, and [...] "Lucky Girl" [...] once the smooth intro stops. These dance-pop R beats are the same light and noncommittal ones you've become accustomed to with artists like, as I said earlier, Rihanna and Chris Brown, along with the party feel of The Pussycat Dolls and other contemporaries. Another mood of Unexpected is the party jam feel exhibited by [...] "Private Party" [...] and [...] "Hungover," [...] the tracks you jam while driving down the road with your windows down. [...] "The Greatest," [...] a fantastic pop ballad, and [...] "Thank U," [...] a melodic song about thanking what held you down so you can appreciate how far you've come, round out the heavier, and slower, moods on the album. Summary; this album fits nicely <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> musical niches, making it a good addition to most collections. And you may be humming some of these tracks years down the line. Not my favorite of the year, but not too shabby either." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Chicago house album, Virgos music draws {{elements}} {{from the local}} deep house and acid house styles, and bears influence and similitaries {{with the work of}} Larry Heard, Fingers Inc. and Armando.

However, Virgo has been noted for its idiosyncratic sound, more introspective and dreamy than other mechanically intense styles from its era, Phuture's [...] "Acid Trax" [...] for example. In a 2009 interview, Merwyn Sanders stated: [...] "We were <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> classic stuff, Kraftwerk and Gary Numan and a lot of jazz stuff. That’s what I grew up around, listening. My dad was a huge jazz fan, so that was just engrained in my head without me even knowing it. So I guess that’s what you get a little sense of with that album we did." [...] Fact called it a [...] "deep post-acid" [...] album, and wrote that despite being similar to other contemporary house releases, [...] "it stands alone, and its cerebral but generously groovy evocation of the urban nightscape has never been matched for elegance or acuity." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described it as [...] "music you might make the day after a drugged-out bacchanal – wistful and contemplative, shot through with a creeping, contagious melancholy." [...] Joe Muggs described Virgo as [...] "archetypal house music through and through: it is design {{as much as it is}} art, absolutely attuned to the proportions and metabolism of the human body in a technological society." [...] He also noted that despite the [...] "soulfulness and the spindly stripping down of its production", the album is not [...] "less powerful than noisier, bassier or thicker music." ...|$|E
