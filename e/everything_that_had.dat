5|$|The video focuses {{solely on}} lead singer, Jason Wade, {{as the rest}} of the band members do not appear in the video. The video begins by showing Wade sitting alone on a bed, with {{pictures}} of him and his girlfriend on the wall. He proceeds to walk around the house, while various things in the room he's in begin to explode around him, such as the bed and pictures in the bedroom, and various food and drink items in the kitchen. Near the end things begin going in reverse, and <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> exploded is put back together. The video ends with Wade sitting back on the bed with his girlfriend now lying next to him.|$|E
5|$|The film began full {{production}} in 2002. While most projects of its type took 18–24 months to complete, the development team completed {{the film in}} 13months. The project's budget was later estimated as being between $3.5 to $5million. In addition to Creative Capers, Taiwanese studio CGCG created most of the animation: at the time, overseas outsourcing was a rarity for CGI movies. By the end of production, the film ran to 77minutes of raw footage. At this stage, 310 Studios {{was brought in to}} handle post production, which mostly entailed cutting the film's length down by 7minutes. According to 310 Studios president Billy Jones, the hardest part of this was deciding which pieces needed to be cut, as they were impressed with <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been produced. 310 Studios also created the opening title and ending credit sequences. Lego also partnered with Miramax to distribute the film, along with developing a future full feature-length theatrical film.|$|E

Diodorus' view was <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> happened must be true, and that therefore nothing is possible which can never be true.|$|R

25|$|Bobby Ewing's {{death in}} the season eight finale, {{alongside}} his subsequent absence during the following season, was explained away {{at the beginning of}} season ten as a dream of Pamela Barnes Ewing, thus effectively erasing <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> happened during season nine. Actor Patrick Duffy had left the series to pursue other opportunities, but due to declining ratings, he was convinced to return to the series by production company Lorimar as well as series star Larry Hagman.|$|E

Two days later, <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> not been sold (with {{the exception of the}} Face, Crystal Palace, and Coney Island) was bulldozed to the ground and burnt. The park was rebuilt by Australian Amusements, following design advice from Texas-based LARC International.|$|E

25|$|In 1953, the Battle Creek team {{became the}} Muskegon Lassies, {{and by the}} end of the season, it too, folded. Faut came back for her final year in the AAGPBL. Her team was {{weakened}} considerably by the player losses at the end of the previous season, and Faut was worn down from all the dissension. South Bend would finish the season second from last, compiling a 45–65 record. In spite of <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> gone wrong, Faut still turned to post a 17–11 record and produced a league-best 1.51 ERA in 29 games, though league offensive levels were increasing. By her final season, only overhand pitching was allowed, the ball was a lively cork-centered ten inches, and the basepaths were seventy-five feet. More importantly from a pitching perspective, the pitching rubber was moved back to fifty-six feet, thirteen feet farther away than in 1946. At the same time, fences were moved in to allow for more home runs.|$|E
25|$|Bernini did {{not entirely}} lose patronage, not {{even of the}} pope. Innocent X {{maintained}} Bernini {{in all of the}} official roles given to him by Urban. Under Bernini's design and direction, work continued on decorating the massive new but entirely unadorned nave of St. Peter's, with the addition of an elaborate multi-colored marble flooring, marble facing on the walls and pilasters, and scores of stuccoed statues and reliefs. It is not without reason that Pope Alexander VII once quipped, 'if one were to remove from Saint Peter's <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been made by the Cavalier Bernini, that temple would be stripped bare.' Indeed, given all of his many and various works within the basilica over several decades, it is to Bernini that is due the lion's share of responsibility for the final and enduring aesthetic appearance and emotional impact of St. Peter's. He was also allowed to continue to work on Urban VIII's tomb, despite Innocent's antipathy for the Barberini. A few months after completing Urban's tomb, Bernini won, under controversial circumstances, the Pamphilj commission for the prestigious Four Rivers Fountain on Piazza Navona, marking the end of his disgrace and the beginning a yet another glorious chapter in his life.|$|E

Previously, {{the very existence of}} the communist party as a component of GRUNK had been hidden. Within the [...] "liberated zones" [...] it was simply referred to as [...] "Angka" [...] – the organization. During 1973, the communist party fell under the control of its most fanatical members, Pol Pot and Son Sen, who believed that [...] "Cambodia was to go through a total social revolution and that <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> preceded it was anathema and must be destroyed." ...|$|E

While Jackson sought medical help for his faltering health, his legal team and friends, such as Presley and Taylor, took control of his defense and finances. Much of Jackson's legal team would meet three times a week at Taylor's home to discuss the case. Taylor then called in more legal professionals on Jackson's behalf. Eventually Presley, Taylor, and Jackson's team all agreed that the singer should settle out of court; it was their opinion that the entertainer's health had deteriorated {{to such a degree that}} he could not endure a lengthy trial.|$|E

500|$|Tzara's career changed course between 1914 and 1916, {{during a}} period when the Romanian Kingdom kept out of World War I. In autumn 1915, as founder {{and editor of the}} {{short-lived}} journal Chemarea, Vinea published two poems by his friend, the first printed works to bear the signature Tristan Tzara. At the time, the young poet and many of his friends were adherents of an anti-war and anti-nationalist current, which progressively accommodated anti-establishment messages. Chemarea, which was a platform for this agenda and again attracted collaborations from Chapier, may also have been financed by Tzara and Vinea. According to Romanian avant-garde writer Claude Sernet, the journal was [...] "totally different from <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been printed in Romania before that moment." [...] During the period, Tzara's works were sporadically published in Hefter-Hidalgo's Versuri și Proză, and, in June 1915, Constantin Rădulescu-Motru's Noua Revistă Română published Samyro's known poem Verișoară, fată de pension ("Little Cousin, Boarding School Girl").|$|E

[...] Moss' initial reaction [...] "was just one of feeling like {{there was really no}} other logical way to go for her. After <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> happened for five years, she can't just keep butting her head up against that wall. [...] She's becoming her own person and she needs to have her own place not under Don." [...] Moss also said, [...] "I will thank [...] forever for not telling me. It would have made my life harder. I knew about Peggy's baby in season one. I fought against it, to play it as she was living it, feeling it, and not be in my head. Not knowing Peggy would quit allowed me to find it for myself, to really feel Peggy's growing frustration with Don all season." ...|$|E
500|$|Summit Entertainment, the {{production}} company which had produced Step Up, offered Rosenberg {{the chance to}} adapt Stephenie Meyer's bestselling novel Twilight into a film of the same name, which she accepted. Her primary inspiration for the adaptation was Brokeback Mountain, which she described as a [...] "great model" [...] of forbidden love alongside Romeo and Juliet, and thought its adaptation from short story to film was [...] "beautiful". She was given a [...] "manifesto" [...] written by Meyer outlining <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> to be included or could not be changed in the adaptation. She wrote a detailed 25-page outline in August 2007, expecting to have another two months to write the actual screenplay, but had only five weeks to finish the script before the commencement of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. After the release of Twilight, she was hired by Summit to adapt the sequels New Moon and Eclipse, {{the second and third}} books in the series, respectively, and she had already begun drafting the New Moon screenplay by November 2008.|$|E
