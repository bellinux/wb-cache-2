The incident investigated was a hydraulic oil leak from the Eirik Raude drilling rig during exploration drilling in the Barents Sea in April 2005. The incident is analyzed using influence diagrams, from which seven general barriers against hydraulic leaks have been identified. For each barrier both checkpoints and indicators have been developed, which provide information {{about the status of}} the barriers and <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> of potential spills.

We use a quarterly panel of 40 EU and OECD countries for the period 1970 – 2010. As the response variable, we construct a continuous index of crisis incidence capturing the real costs for the economy. As the potential <b>warning</b> <b>indicators,</b> we evaluate a wide range of variables, selected according to the previous literature and our own considerations. For each potential indicator we determine the optimal lead employing panel vector autoregression, then we select useful indicators employing Bayesian model averaging. We re-estimate the resulting specification by system GMM to account for potential endogeneity of some indicators. Subsequently, to allow for country heterogeneity, we evaluate the random coefficients estimator and illustrate the stability among endogenous clusters.

40|$|Abstract: Exploration and {{production}} {{of oil and gas}} in certain sensitive areas such as the Barents Sea and Lofoten, is controversial and further expansion depends on the ability to avoid harmful spills. One way of improving the ability to avoid such spills is to use <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>indicators.</b> The objective of the work presented in this paper is to describe and compare strengths and weaknesses of different approaches for the development of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>indicators.</b> The approaches that have been compared are: safety performance-based methods; risk-based methods; incident-based methods; and resilience-based methods. There are pros and cons with all methods. All methods are very favorable with respect to some characteristics {{and at the same time}} very unfavorable to some other characteristics. They are also different in terms of scope and depth of analysis. This suggests that we should be flexible with respect to the choice of methods, and preferably use more than one method. Thus, the main conclusion is that it is favorable to have the possibility to use several different methods for the establishment of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>indicators...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{and provides}} empirical tests of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> of banking and currency crises in emerging economies. The {{aim is to}} identify key empirical regularities {{in the run-up to}} banking and currency crises that would enable officials and private market participants to recognize vulnerability to financial crises at an earlier stage. This, in turn, should make it easier to motivate the corrective policy actions that would prevent such crises from actually taking place. Interest in identifying <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> of financial crises has soared of late, stoked primarily by two factors. First, there is increasing recognition that banking and currency crises can be extremely costly to the countries in which they originate; in addition, these crises often spillover via a variety of international channels to increase the vulnerability of other countries to financial crisis. The second reason for the increased interest in <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> of financial crises is that there is accumulating evidence that two of the most closely watched “market indicators” of default and currency risks [...] namely, interest rate spreads and changes in credit ratings [...] frequently do not provide much advance warning of currency and banking crises. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of persistent midlatitude atmospheric flow regimes with time-scales larger than 5 - 10 days and indications of preferred transitions between them motivates to develop early warning indicators for such regime transitions. In this paper, {{we use a}} hemispheric barotropic model together with estimates of transfer operators on a reduced phase space to develop an <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> of the zonal to blocked flow transition in this model. It is shown that, the spectrum of the transfer operators {{can be used to}} study the slow dynamics of the flow as well as the non-Markovian character of the reduction. The slowest motions are thereby found to have time scales of three to six weeks and to be associated with meta-stable regimes (and their transitions) which can be detected as almost-invariant sets of the transfer operator. From the energy budget of the model, we are able to explain the meta-stability of the regimes and the {{existence of}} preferred transition paths. Even though the model is highly simplified, the skill of the <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> is promising, suggesting that the transfer operator approach can be used in parallel to an operational deterministic model for stochastic prediction or to assess forecast uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{sustainable}} water quality management {{is to keep}} total pollutant discharges from exceeding the assimilation capacity of a water body. Climate change may influence streamflows, and further alter assimilation capacity and degrade river sustainability. The {{purposes of this study}} are to evaluate the effect of climate change on sustainable water quality management and design an <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> to issue warnings on river sustainability. A systematic assessment procedure is proposed here, including a weather generation model, the streamflow component of GWLF, QUAL 2 E, and an optimization model. The Touchen creek in Taiwan is selected as the study area. Future climate scenarios derived from projections of four global climate models (GCMs) and two pollutant discharge scenarios, as usual and proportional to population, are considered in this study. The results indicate that streamflows may very likely increase in humid seasons and decrease in arid seasons, respectively. The reduction of streamflow in arid seasons may further degrade water quality and assimilation capacity. In order to provide warnings to trigger necessary adaptation strategies, an <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> is designed and its 30 -year moving average is calculated.
