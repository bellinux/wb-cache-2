The project was articulated in several subsequent phases, each focusing on specific systems. ASV- 3, the third phase of the project, proposed an ARAS System based on inter-vehicle communication able to connect and share considerable information between vehicles (relative position, relative speed and so forth). The associated HMI system is comprised of an Head Up Display, a display for rear view camera, speakers and a microphone integrated in the helmet. The ARAS functions included <b>intersection</b> <b>accident</b> avoidance and blind spot assistance, and warnings to the rider were transmitted through visual and acoustic signals. The head up display showed a representation of PTW surrounding area split in several sectors: the enlightened sector indicated {{the direction of the}} oncoming vehicle.

This thesis focuses on analysis of crash data from vehicles not equipped with collision warning systems. Vehicle parameters before and during an accident can be recorded using an Event Data Recorder (EDR) which helps in reconstructing an accident. This tool, installed in the vehicle, records different crash parameters like vehicle speed, lateral and longitudinal acceleration, seat-belt status, and air-bag deployment over a period that spens the accident. This thesis focuses on accident reconstruction with and without EDR data. A simulation software tool called HVE is used to visually recreate the reconstructed accidents. HVE is a platform to execute different accident simulation methods which are used for specific types of simulations. Two such simulation methods, EDSMAC 4 and EDHIS, are discussed in this thesis. The former is an important method for vehicle-to-vehicle collisions and the latter is used for analysis of human behavior involved in the accident. 		Three real-life accidents were chosen for reconstruction and simulation. They were Bus and Car accident, Three Vehicle accident and <b>Intersection</b> <b>accident.</b> These particular accidents were chosen to represent a diverse selection of accidents based on the following parameters: {{the locations of the}} accidents, the vehicles involved in each accident, and the data available. A qualitative analysis of vehicle occupant's behavior is also presented for one of the three accidents. The thesis discusses in detail the reconstruction of these three accidents. Throughout these simulations, the thesis illustrates the advantages and limitations of the EDR and HVE simulation software for accident reconstruction and simulation...|$|E

For accident preventive measures to be effective, knowledge is needed about common causal {{factors that contribute}} to the occurrence of accidents. This paper aims towards identification of such common factors for a specific subset of all road <b>accidents,</b> namely <b>intersection</b> <b>accidents.</b> The data used for the study consists of in-depth investigation material from sixteen <b>intersection</b> <b>accidents</b> that have been investigated by a multi-disciplinary accident investigation team. Data analysis was performed using DREAM, a MTO based accident investigation method. The results indicate that cognitive bias, hidden information, inadequate design of traffic environment, and competing task are common contributing factors of <b>intersection</b> <b>accidents.</b> Also, the distribution of factors for different collision path scenarios was studied, and several patterns in the distribution were discovered. These patterns were then compared to the results of another study with a similar aim, but based on database statistics rather that in-depth data. The conclusion of the comparison is that the DREAM method, in combination with in-depth accident data, provides a deeper and more detailed insight into how and why different factors contribute to accidents, and these insights are well suited for accident preventive work...|$|R

40|$|After age 75, {{the risk}} of <b>intersection</b> <b>accident</b> {{involvement}} for older drivers increases for most intersection maneuvers. Failure to yield right-of-way and violation of traffic controls are common citations. Previous research has argued that age-related declines in attentional breadth and switching can discriminate between those who are and are not {{more likely to be}} in an accident. The present study examined the effect of time constraints on older and younger driver intersection decisions. It was expected that less time to decide, process and act upon intersection decisions would adversely affect older drivers more so than younger drivers. The change blindness or flicker paradigm was modified to address these questions (see, e. g., Rensink, et al., 1997). Typically, an image (A) is alternated with a modified image (A’) each for a short duration (250 ms) with a blank field or mask (80 ms) between A and A’. In the present study, a focus screen (or prime) that indicated the expected direction of travel (i. e., left, right, or straight) was added prior to the alternation of images. Forty-eight images were selected from 2500 intersection approaches in Calgary, Winnipeg and Montreal that were filmed using a digital camera during the day. Photoshop was used to create the A’ images by manipulating a variety of elements including pedestrians, vehicles, signs, and signals. The goal of the participant was to decide if the indicated direction of travel in the pair of intersection images was safe (press accelerator) or not (press brake). Sixteen younger (M = 22. 3) and 16 older drivers (M = 73. 6) drivers were screened for visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and medication use. Length of image alternation was the primary independent variable (4 and 8 s). As expected, older drivers were more likely to miss intersection changes at shorter exposure durations than younger drivers. A number of qualitative probes were also collected that clearly illustrate the contextual demands of intersections on attention. The implications of the results for intersection design and older driver selective attention are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Left-turning {{traffic is}} {{a major source of}} {{conflicts}} at intersections. Though an average of only 10 % to 15 % of all approach traffic turns left, these vehicles are involved in approximately 45 % of all accidents. This report presents the results of research conducted to develop models which estimate approach accident rates at high speed signalized intersections. The objective of the research was to quantify the relationship between traffic and intersection characteristics, and accident potential of different left turn treatments. Geometric, turning movement counts, and traffic signal phasing data were collected at 100 intersections in Iowa using a questionnaire sent to municipalities. Not all questionnaires resulted in complete data and ultimately complete data were derived for 63 intersections providing a database of 248 approaches. Accident data for the same approaches were obtained from the Iowa Department of Transportation Accident Location and Analysis System (ALAS). Regression models were developed for two different dependent variables: 1) the ratio of the number of left turn accidents per approach to million left turning vehicles per approach, and 2) the ratio of accidents per approach to million traffic movements per approach. A number of regression models were developed for both dependent variables. One model using each dependent variable was developed for intersections with low, medium, and high left turning traffic volumes. As expected, the research indicates that protected left turn phasing has a lower accident potential than protected/permitted or permitted phasing. Left turn lanes and multiple lane approaches are beneficial for reducing accident rates, while raised medians increase the likelihood of accidents. Signals that are part of a signal system tend to have lower accident rates than isolated signals. The resulting regression models may be used to determine the likely impact of various left turn treatments on <b>intersection</b> <b>accident</b> rates. When designing an intersection approach, a traffic engineer may use the models to estimate the accident rate reduction as a result of improved lane configurations and left turn treatments. The safety benefits may then be compared to any costs associated with operational effects to the intersection (i. e., increased delay) to determine the benefits and costs of making intersection safety improvements...|$|E
40|$|Department of Electrical EngineeringOver {{the past}} several years, the {{computer}} vision community has been researching object detection and classification. These can be applied many fields, but are particularly important to autonomous car development. In initial work in this area, many researchers sought higher accuracy on images. The recently developed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) stands as great achievement. However, its training model is only suitable for photos, because its training data consists of many photos. To achieve higher performance on dash-cam videos, we need to acquire and process voluminous dash-cam training data for suitable training. For supervised learning, each object must be labelledhowever, is the computation cost for this is very high because the video has many frames and many objects. For reducing cost of labeling and automatically increasing object detection and classification system accuracy, the present study proposes incremental learning for an object recognition system. The proposed model {{is based on a}} Faster R-CNN (Regions with Convolutional Neural Network features) model for object detection and recognition. My main idea can be divided into two parts. The first is detection with object tracking. Faster R-CNN’s object detector depends solely on an object proposal network. Thus, sometimes it ignores many objects. In the proposed method, this shortcoming is overcome using video’s feature. Video has a time domain, and previous and current frames have correlation of visualized objects. Accordingly, an object tracker is used. Summation of object proposal and object tracking results yields remarkable progress in object detection. The second is object classification and incremental learning. Previous works train a model using training data, and they focus on optimizing the model with training data. Thus, to improve the accuracy or add training data, we should use a re-training model. This method requires a division of time between training and testing. Thus, a simultaneous learning system for real-time to improve accuracy is proposed here. If inputted data’s output object score is higher than a threshold, then we retain this object for reuse as training data. This method makes mAP improvement effects. For availability of autonomous vehicles, security is paramount. State-of-the-art works are based on sensor or simple visual detection. For example, distance between vehicles is detected using the radar, and lane departure detection is done using a line detection algorithm. However, this is just a single functionit can detect head-on collisions but cannot execute sufficiently rapidly for dangerous situations. So, a hazard or accident prediction and accident categorization system is proposed here. The proposed system can detect a variety of hazards and accidents, and it can categorize kinds of accident, not only involving the user’s car but also between others. The proposed system focuses on giving warning information to drivers. The algorithm used here is based on a CNN-LSTM model with many accident videos. Two models are used for this system. The first is a hazard or accident detection model. This model attaches the label of accident probability, and final loss layer is the Euclidean loss layer for model training. This enables it to detect the probability of hazard or accident, and if its output is over the threshold then a hazard is identified and then input into the accident categorization model. Second is an accident categorization model. My system can detect nine kinds of accidents: forward, cut in car accident, <b>intersection</b> <b>accident,</b> jay walking, collision with two-wheeled vehicle, collision between another vehicle and a two-wheeled vehicle, another car slipping, another car reversing, and rollover accident of another car. The algorithm uses a max-pooling layer after LSTM layers for feature information propagation of having striking features. clos...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} models for predicting <b>accidents</b> at the <b>intersections</b> in a road network, from the turning traffic volumes at each <b>intersection.</b> The <b>accident</b> prediction models were developed using Poisson and negative binomial regression {{for each of the}} major accident types, at each of the major intersection types. Countrywide models that predict the motor vehicle accidents (accidents involving motor vehicles only) in a five year period, from the product of the conflicting traffic volumes were developed for each accident type. Accident prediction models have also been developed to predict the number of motor vehicle accidents occurring in different periods of the day (eg. the morning peak, 7 am to 9 am) and in different urban centres. This thesis also describes three case studies, where the accident prediction models have been used to predict the total number of accidents (major accident types) at the intersections in three road networks.

For the Netherlands, the fraction of accidents where the PTW rider is not hit from behind is 99 % for both fatalities and injuries. Since no better statistics are available, it is assumed that the same fractions hold for the EU.

30|$|The {{effectiveness}} is estimated as 50 – 60 % (the road user is {{made aware of}} the danger and system is expected to be effective), based on results from the eIMPACT [15], PReVAL [16] and Intersafe 2 projects [17, 28]. These studies looked at a similar system, the main difference being that the VRU is not warned. The system effect could be negatively impacted by overreliance, distraction, annoyance or lack of trust. eIMPACT and PReVAL both estimate a reduction of the effect of the system. eIMPACT estimates that speed at intersections will increase by 1 %, leading to an increase in fatalities and injuries at intersections by 2 %. PReVAL estimates an increase of fatalities and injuries by 1.5 % due to overreliance. Assuming that the vehicle speed will increase by 0 – 2 % (in line with the eIMPACT assumption), there is a 0 – 6 % increase of <b>intersection</b> <b>accidents</b> due to overreliance (taking into account that VRUs are more vulnerable than vehicle passengers).

40|$|<b>Intersection</b> <b>accidents</b> {{result in}} a {{significant}} proportion of road fatalities, and attention allocation likely plays a role. Attention allocation may depend on (limited) working memory (WM) capacity. Driving is often combined with tasks increasing WM load, consequently impairing attention orienting. This study (n = 22) investigated WM load effects on event-related potentials (ERPs) related to attention orienting. A simulated driving environment allowed continuous lane-keeping measurement. Participants were asked to orient attention covertly towards the side indicated by an arrow, and to respond only to moving cars appearing on the attended side by pressing a button. WM load was manipulated using a concurrent memory task. ERPs showed typical attentional modulation (cue: contralateral negativity, LDAP; car: N 1, P 1, SN and P 3) under low and high load conditions. With increased WM load, lane-keeping performance improved, while dual task performance degraded (memory task: increased error rate; orienting task: increased false alarms, smaller P 3). Practitioner Summary: Intersection driver-support systems aim to improve traffic safety and flow. However, in-vehicle systems induce WM load, increasing the tendency to yield.

Consistent with the original infrastructure consortium proposal, this report emphasizes gaps, older drivers, and rural thru-STOP intersections (Donath & Shankwitz, 2001). This is because older drivers have a high accident risk at rural thru-STOP intersections and problems with gap detection, perception, and acceptance are contributing factors. A task analysis of rural thru-STOP negotiation was used to define the informational requirements for an IDS system for assisting with gap detection, perception and judgment. An abstraction hierarchy defined the operator (driver) constraints relevant to an infrastructure-based IDS system. Four design concepts were constructed and tested in a driving simulator with older (55 +) and younger (20 - 40) drivers in day and night driving conditions.

40|$|Proper {{intersection}} {{sight distance}} can effectively lower {{the possibility of}} <b>intersection</b> <b>accidents.</b> American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (2011) provide a series of recommended dimensions of intersection sight triangles for uncontrolled and stop/yield-controlled intersections. However, in reality, although the actual intersection design for unsignalized intersections satisfies the requirements of sight distance and clear sight triangle in American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' guideline, {{there are still a}} large number of crashes occurring at unsignalized intersections for drivers running stop/yield signs or failing to slow down. This paper presents a driving simulator study on pre-crash at intersections under three intersection field of view (IFOV) conditions. The aim was to explore whether better IFOVs at unsignalized intersections improve their emergent collision avoidance performance under an assumption of valid intersection sight distance design. The experimental results show drivers' ability to identify potential hazards to be significantly affected by their IFOVs. As drivers' IFOV improved, drivers were more likely to choose braking actions to avoid collisions. Better IFOVs were also associated with significant increases in brake time to intersection and significant reductions in deceleration rate and crash rate, thus leading to a lower risk of traffic crash involvement. The results indicate that providing a better IFOV for drivers at intersections should be encouraged in practical applications in order to improve drivers' crash avoidance capabilities.

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} first to identify the mechanisms of impact through which selected ITS systems influence the safety of PTW riders, and to describe their effects. Second, we aimed to estimate these impacts quantitatively once these ITS systems are fully deployed in the EU- 28, including in selected future scenarios for 2020 and 2030. According to the analysis, all of the systems we looked at {{have a positive impact on}} PTW rider safety by preventing fatalities and injuries. The best effects (when considering 2012 accident data and full penetration) were offered by PTW 2 V and INS, and the weakest by VBS. The estimated medium annual drop in PTW rider fatalities in the EU- 28 varied between 216 and 283 per system at 2012 accident levels. The strong effect of PTW 2 V is not surprising, since this system potentially addresses all multi-vehicle accidents. It could be even increased if higher levels of usage attained (currently 20 – 50 % of non-usage was assumed to be caused by annoyance). Furthermore, based on the results, the other two systems (INS and VBS) also show significant potential for improving the safety of PTW riders. Their effects are, however, slightly lower, mainly because INS and VBS target only specific situations — INS <b>intersection</b> <b>accidents,</b> and VBS mainly situations with obstructed views or unexpected behaviour of VRUs. However, even small safety effects can be significant when, as we assume will happen in the future, the systems are introduced as combinations or bundles, especially when individual systems in a bundle target different type of accidents.|$|R

The charter driver was a former MTA bus driver, until he was fired in April 2015 after a crash in his personal automobile in which he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence and leaving the scene of the crash.|$|R
40|$|YRS 2015 - Young Researchers Seminar, Rome, Italie, 17 -/ 06 / 2015 - 19 / 06 / 2015 Accidents statistics, {{show that}} older drivers are {{over-represented}} in <b>intersection</b> <b>accidents,</b> especially when turning left. Our study aims at better understanding how does ageing affects the driving abilities of elderly drivers {{in this particular}} situation. Three groups participates, young (25 - 35 years), younger-old (60 - 69 years) and older-old (70 and more) {{took part in the}} experiment. The experiment consisted in two parts. Perceptual, cognitive and motor abilities were assessed in the first one. The second one took place on a driving simulator. Participants had to decide if they could perform a left turn at intersections. Traffic conditions such as speed, number of vehicles and direction of the traffic were manipulated. Statistical analysis showed the classicals age-related perceptual, cognitive and physical declines. With regards to driving performance, elderly drivers accepted fewer left-turn than younger drivers, but exhibited more risky behaviors. They initiated the maneuvers later, had shorter safety margins and took more risky decisions. Two patterns emerge from correlations between test results and driving behavior. Driving performances of young people showed that both their cognitive - inhibition and working memory - and perceptual abilities - visual scanning and vision - correlated with driving performances, but not their motor abilities. As for elderly people, cognitive - processing speed, inhibition and updating - and motor abilities - motor flexibility - were connected to driving performance, but not their perceptual abilities. Regressions are being processed in order to detail the relationships between the different variables. Results will determine which are the predictors of risky behavior among elderly in intersection...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Turkey is a {{developing}} country undergoing a system change in the prehospital emergency medical services (EMS). The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of the institutional structure and legislative framework on the number of ambulance accidents in Turkey. Methods: During the first phase of the study, ambulance accident data was requested and obtained from the Ministry of the Interior. Similarly, data on ambulance numbers were requested and obtained from the Ministry of Health through the Right to Information law. During the second phase of the study, a survey consisting of 112 EMS personnel viewpoints about the effects of the institutional structure and legislative framework on ambulance accidents was conducted using a structured questionnaire. A total of 209 EMS personnel completed the survey. Results: The number of ambulance accidents increased by 42. 5 % over the last five years, whereas the area of coverage increased by 57. 3 % during the same period. The rate of EMS personnel experiencing ambulance accidents was 69. 4 %. When age, sex, and profession variables were considered, the varying profiles of the ambulance operators were found to have no significant effect on the number of ambulance accidents following the system change. Conclusion: The rise in the number of ambulance accidents in Turkey was not significant when compared with the increase in the area of responsibility. The present system change was also found to have no effect on the number of accidents. On the other hand, problematic areas in the institutional structure and the legislative framework increased the risk of accidents.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated that older drivers {{are more likely to be}} involved in collisions in complex traffic scenarios like intersections even if they are not more involved in accidents in general. Moreover, being more vulnerable, the older driver is generally at higher risk of sustaining an injury when involved in a traffic accident. Even though there may be many factors leading to the over-involvement of older drivers in intersection collisions it is clear that the visual capacity and the ability to observe may be one of the possible causes that is of high interest to understand further. The objective of the study is to identify to what degree the visual behaviour could explain older drivers' involvement in <b>intersection</b> <b>accidents.</b> A 20 km long route composed by intersections in rural and urban environment was selected to collect both driving and eye movement data. Two groups of drivers were compared, one group aged 35 - 55 years and one aged 75 and above. Apart from the driving data, neck flexibility measurement was performed. The results from the neck flexibility measurement showed a clear age effect, with the older drivers showing less neck flexibility. When it comes to visual behaviour data, a difference was also found concerning the area of interest the drivers looked at; while the older drivers looked more at lines and markings on the road to position themselves in the traffic, the younger drivers looked more at dynamic objects such as other cars representing a possible threat. The difference in the visual behaviour should be used to design safety systems for all drivers to support them when they drive through an intersection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Accident {{studies in}} Germany {{found that in}} about 90 % of <b>intersection</b> <b>accidents,</b> failure to acquire the {{relevant}} information of the driving situation was {{the main reason for}} drivers’ errors (Vollrath et al. in Ableitung von Anforderungen an Fahrerassistenzsysteme aus Sicht der Verkehrssicherheit. Wirtschaftsverlag NW, Bremerhaven, 2006). Studies of bicycle–car accidents assume that improper attention allocation strategies and unjustified expectations by drivers are important for this kind of error (Ra¨sa¨nen and Summala in Accid Anal Prev 30 : 657 – 666, 1998). Aim {{of the study was to}} examine the psychological processes of drivers’ attention allocation and driving behavior in different intersection situations varied by two environmental characteristics. A give way T-intersection was varied by (1) low and high traffic density of oncoming cars from the left and (2) number of task-relevant information areas (in addition to the oncoming cars from the left with or without pedestrians on the right). It was examined how these environmental characteristics change in their relevance for drivers while entering the intersections. The analysis was conducted in three intersection epochs (Approaching, Waiting, Accelerating). A total of 40 subjects (26 male, 14 female), ranged in age from 19 to 55 years (M = 31. 0 years), participated in the study. The results showed that drivers’ attention allocation (e. g., mean gaze duration) and driving behavior (e. g., waiting time) systematically depends on these environmental characteristics which require different actions of the driver and change in their relevance when entering an intersection. The results support the idea of attention allocation strategies by drivers which are specific for certain driving situations. These findings can support approaches of driver modeling at intersections...|$|R
