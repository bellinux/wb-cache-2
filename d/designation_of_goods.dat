Incorporating safety in the <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> a Dangerous <b>Goods</b> Route Network will be demonstrated using the City of Calgary’s network as an example. A research project was conducted in 2003 by Hamilton-Finn for the Centre of Transportation Engineering and Planning (C-TEP) {{in cooperation with the}} City of Calgary, to: • Establish criteria for the selection <b>of</b> dangerous <b>goods</b> routes; • Review the adequacy of the current network; and • Identify changes and upgrades using a transparent and repeatable process.

40|$|Small {{retention}} basins are water managing objects for acumulation {{of water for}} the purpose of cultivating land, cattle feeding and other. They are mostly used by individual rural economies for their own local needs for irrigation of smaller agricultural areas (orchards, smaller plantations etc.) or source of water for their livestock.

This is followed by some basic instructions for building small detention basins on different composition of geological characteristics found in Slovenia. <b>Designation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>good</b> catchment area can be a challenging task because of the very high inequality of precipitation distribution in Slovenia. Therefore this thesis includes a good orientational help in form of maps of potential annual and winter water storage in Slovenia that have been made on demand of Ministry of agriculture. In continuation there is a more thorough description of the realization of all four basic components of retention basin: reservoir, dam, outlet structure and emergency spillway.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityThe general problem {{of this study was}} to evaluate the judo programs in selected gymnasiums in the Republic of Korea (R. O. K.). All the gymnasiums (43) were private. The evaluative instrument was a modified version of the N. P. Neilson/Sung-Chul Moon Score Card to Evaluate University Sport Education Programs in the Republic of Korea. The purpose {{of this study was to}} evaluate the judo programs of 43 gymnasiums in the Republic of Korea. To modify the instrument for use in evaluating the specific area of judo programs, a panel of four South Korean experts was selected through a review of literature and based upon their publications and experience in judo programs. Since Sung-Chul Moon modified the score card pioneered by N. P. Neilson for evaluating boys' physical education programs in high schools in the United States, needed cultural adjustments had already been made. The researcher and the panel of experts then made the requisite modifications to the N. P. Neilson/Sung-Chul Moon Score Card so the instrument could be used to evaluate judo programs in the R. O. K. Each judo program was evaluated in four areas; I) Instructor, 2) Team Captain, 3) Programs, and 4) Facilities. All data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, scoring each judo program with the possible <b>designations</b> <b>of</b> excellent, <b>good,</b> average, below average, or poor in each of the four program divisions. The results indicated the total scores for judo programs in all gymnasiums ranged from poor to good. Specific recommendations were for each of the 43 judo gymnasiums to improve their weaknesses and retain strengths. General recommendations were made for all the gymnasiums, Programs in the Republic of Korea...|$|R

All the men and only one-quarter {{of the women were}} identified by name. Patronymic designations were typical for the majority of men and only used once as the <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> a woman.
