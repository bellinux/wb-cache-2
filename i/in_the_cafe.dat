40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to examine how a {{community}} health project “Sundhedshuset”(House of health) in Tingbjerg, manages to reduce inequality in health. It is in this project analyzed from interviews and observations, how Sundhedshuset through cafés works with health promotion to a target group of highly socially exposed women. The definition of ‘health’ in this project, {{is based on the}} review “Det åbne sundhedsbegreb” (The open health concept) by Steen Wackerhausen. Health is understood as ‘competence’ which means the capability of reaching a goal. This project aims to uncover whether the highly exposed women’s ‘competences’ are improved and as we understand this improvement though the process of learning, we use theories of learning by Knud Illeris and Etienne Wenger. The possibilities of learning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cafés</b> and <b>the</b> question whether the womens ‘competences’ are improved, becomes our focus of attention. It is concluded that the possibilities of learning existing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cafés,</b> results <b>in</b> an improvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> women’s ‘competences’. There are potential learning possibilities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cafés,</b> through social interaction, talks and the option to become a volunteer worker. <b>The</b> <b>cafés</b> are not obligatory, but open for everyone. It constitutes a relaxed place, where networking, information, counseling, a social gathering takes place in an informal, secure and social learning context. The women have the option of learning different things; for example, concrete professional knowledge, developing abilities to engage in activities, to take responsibility, gain new insights, to negotiate meaning and to exchange knowledge, which summarized can be viewed as good possibilities for learning. Furthermore it is concluded that the women who attends <b>the</b> <b>cafés</b> will, as a result, acquire the possibilities of developing their own capacity of action and life-conditions, thus improving the ‘competences’ altogether...|$|R
