5|$|After having {{consulted}} for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, Gingrich encouraged his <b>fellow</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{to unify}} behind Trump, who had by then become the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Gingrich reportedly figured among Trump's final three choices {{to be his}} running mate; the position ultimately went to Mike Pence, a politician known {{for his role as}} Governor of Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{views on}} the 2011 budget cuts and his departures from GOP {{consensus}} placed him at odds {{with some of his}} <b>fellow</b> <b>Republicans</b> and prominent Tea Party conservatives, including Glenn Beck.

Unlike most of his <b>fellow</b> <b>Republicans,</b> Ryan voted in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in 2007, which would have prohibited employment {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{began his}} {{four years as}} a state senator as a {{political}} unknown; he ended them {{as one of the}} most popular figures in the Ohio Republican Party. He always appeared calm and displayed humility, characteristics that endeared him to <b>fellow</b> <b>Republicans</b> even as he passed them in his political rise. Legislative leaders consulted him on difficult problems. It was usual at that time for state senators in Ohio to serve only one term, but Harding gained renomination in 1901. After the assassination of McKinley in September (he was succeeded by Vice President Theodore Roosevelt), much of the appetite for politics was temporarily lost in Ohio. In November, Harding won a second term, more than doubling his margin of victory to 3,563 votes.|$|E
5|$|With Speaker Schuyler Colfax’ {{election}} to the Vice Presidency in 1868, {{the leadership of the}} House became vacant. Blaine had only been a member of Congress since 1863, but he had developed a reputation for parliamentary skill and, aside from a growing feud with Roscoe Conkling of New York, was popular with his <b>fellow</b> <b>Republicans.</b> He was elected with the unanimous vote of the Republican members {{at the start of the}} 41st Congress in March 1869. Blaine was an effective Speaker with a magnetic personality. Moreover, President Ulysses S. Grant valued his skill and loyalty in leading the House. He enjoyed the job and made his presence in Washington more permanent by buying a large residence on Fifteenth Street in the city. At the same time, the Blaine family moved to a mansion in Augusta.|$|E

5|$|In 1789, Adams {{was elected}} Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts {{and served in}} that office until Governor Hancock's death in 1793, when he became acting {{governor}}. The next year, Adams was elected as governor in his own right, {{the first of four}} annual terms. He was generally regarded as the leader of his state's Jeffersonian Republicans, who were opposed to the Federalist Party. Unlike some other Republicans, Adams supported the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 for the same reasons that he had opposed Shays's Rebellion. Like his <b>fellow</b> <b>Republicans,</b> he spoke out against the Jay Treaty in 1796, a position that drew criticism in a state that was increasingly Federalist. In that year's U. S. presidential election, Republicans in Virginia cast 15 electoral votes for Adams {{in an effort to make}} him Jefferson's vice-president, but Federalist John Adams won the election, with Jefferson becoming vice-president. The Adams cousins remained friends, but Samuel was pleased when Jefferson defeated John Adams in the 1800 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|John Boehner, {{a member}} of the Republican Party from Ohio, served as the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives from February 2006 until January 2007. As the Democratic Party assumed control of the House {{following}} the 2006 elections, Boehner served as Minority Leader from January 2007 until January 2011. When Republicans reassumed control of the House of Representatives in January 2011, Boehner was elected as Speaker, with the votes of all 241 of his <b>fellow</b> <b>Republicans.</b> In 2014, some House Republicans reached out to Ben Carson about his interest in becoming Speaker should they be able to oust Boehner; Carson declined, citing his impending candidacy for president. Boehner's Republican opponents formed a congressional caucus, called the Freedom Caucus, in January 2015 to focus their opposition. Though Boehner was reelected as Speaker {{at the beginning of the}} 114th United States Congress that month, 25 conservative members of the Republican caucus did not vote for him. Daniel Webster, a Republican from Florida, received 12 votes.|$|E
5|$|When the 39th Congress {{assembled}} in December 1865, Hayes {{was sworn in}} {{as a part of a}} large Republican majority. Hayes identified with the moderate wing of the party, but was willing to vote with the radicals for the sake of party unity. The major legislative effort of the Congress was the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, for which Hayes voted and which passed both houses of Congress in June 1866. Hayes's beliefs were in line with his <b>fellow</b> <b>Republicans</b> on Reconstruction issues: that the South should be restored to the Union, but not without adequate protections for freedmen and other black southerners. President Andrew Johnson, who succeeded to office following Lincoln's assassination, to the contrary wanted to re-admit the seceded states quickly without first ensuring that they adopted laws protecting the newly freed slaves' civil rights; he also granted pardons to many of the leading former Confederates. Hayes, along with congressional Republicans, disagreed. They worked to reject Johnson's vision of Reconstruction and to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1866.|$|E

Roosevelt. Sabin and her supporters emphasized that repeal would generate enormous sums of much-needed tax revenue, and weaken the base of organized crime.|$|E
