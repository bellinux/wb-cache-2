5000|$|The late John Ostrom of Yale University mapped {{the site}} and {{reported}} finding 134 tracks preserved in the sandstone beds in a seminal paper he wrote on dinosaur gregariousness. Ostrom attributed the tracks to small, medium, and large theropod dinosaurs, and assigned the tracks to the ichnospecies Grallator cuneatus, which are 3 in to 5 in long, Anchisauripus sillimani, and <b>Eubrontes</b> <b>giganteus,</b> which are 11 in to 13 in long. The parallel orientation of the <b>Eubrontes</b> <b>giganteus</b> trackways and the supposed lack of a physical barrier led Ostrom {{to the conclusion that}} the large animals were gregarious and traveled in a [...] "herd, pack, or flock." ...|$|E
50|$|Tracks {{discovered}} in the Höganäs Formation have been assigned to the ichnogenus Grallator (<b>Eubrontes)</b> cf. <b>giganteus,</b> which were {{discovered in}} Rhaetian strata, and Grallator (Eubrontes) soltykovensis, which were discovered in Hettangian strata. A few of the tracks were taken to museums, {{but most of them}} disappeared in natural floodings. In 1994, Gierlinski and Ahlberg assigned these tracks from the Hoganas Formation of Sweden to Dilophosaurus as well.|$|R
25|$|Fossilized footprints, {{discovered}} in 200-million-year-old sedimentary rock, which {{were assigned to}} Dilophosaurus were {{discovered in}} the Höganäs Formation in Vallåkra, Sweden, during the 1970s. The footprints appears to show that these dinosaurs lived in herds. Fossilized footprints assigned to Dilophosaurus have also been discovered in Sala, Sweden. Other tracks discovered in the Höganäs Formation have been assigned to the ichnogenus Grallator (<b>Eubrontes)</b> cf. <b>giganteus,</b> which were discovered in Rhaetian strata, and Grallator (Eubrontes) soltykovensis, which were discovered in Hettangian strata.

In 1994, Gierlinski and Ahlberg assigned these tracks from the Hoganas Formation of Sweden to Dilophosaurus as well. Gierlinski (1996) observed unusual traces associated with a track specimen in the collection at the Pratt Museum in Amherst, Massachusetts. Specimen AC 1/7 is a [...] "dinosaur sitting imprint", made when a dinosaur is resting its body on the ground, leaving an impression of its belly between a pair of footprints. Traces associated with AC 1/7 were interpreted by Gierlinski as the imprints of feathers, suggesting that Dilophosaurus was a feathered dinosaur. Further analysis proved, however, that the lines that seemed to be feathers were in reality just cracks in the mud where the animal sat. While this does not rule out the possibility of feathery covering on this species, there is no evidence for it and it currently remains as speculation.|$|R
50|$|The first scientifically {{verified}} dinosaur bones {{discovered in}} North America were uncovered during the 1818 excavation of a well in Connecticut. Other notable finds include the aetosaur Stegomus, the phytosaur Clepsysaurus, and the prosauropod dinosaur Anchisaurus. The Jurassic dinosaur track <b>Eubrontes</b> <b>giganteus</b> is the Connecticut state fossil.|$|E
5000|$|The latest mapping project, {{conducted}} by Patrick Getty and Aaron Judge, {{has shown that}} {{there are at least}} 787 dinosaur tracks at the site and that the <b>Eubrontes</b> <b>giganteus</b> trackways are in fact parallel, or nearly parallel, to the orientation of oscillation wave-formed ripples. Considering that oscillation ripples form parallel to the shoreline, these authors suggested that the parallel trackways represent shoreline-paralleling behavior in large carnivores rather than group behavior. The hypothesis that the parallel trackways were made by shoreline-paralleling behavior is further supported by the fact that parallelism is not seen in <b>Eubrontes</b> <b>giganteus</b> trackways preserved at other sites in the Connecticut River Valley. In addition to the footprints of theropod dinosaurs, those of early ornithischians, called Anomoepus scambus (some with associated tail drags), have been identified at Dinosaur Footprint Reservation. [...] Non-dinosaurs are represented by footprints called Batrachopus, which were made by basal crocodilians.|$|E
50|$|In early 1970s, a {{fiberglass}} cast of an <b>Eubrontes</b> <b>giganteus</b> footprint {{was made}} by Paul E. Olsen, then 14 years old, and his friend Tony Lessa. On June 29, 1972, it was sent by Olsen and Lessa to President Richard Nixon to get his support for registering the Riker Hill Fossil Site in Roseland, New Jersey as a National Natural Landmark.|$|E
50|$|Evidence {{of early}} {{occupants}} of the area {{can be found in}} the dinosaur fossil tracks in the sandstone bedrock at Dinosaur Footprints Reservation to the east of Little Tom. <b>Eubrontes</b> <b>giganteus,</b> Anchisauripus sp., and Grallator cuneatus, all bipedal theropods, lived in this area some 200 million years ago. Although no fossil tracks are known to be visible on Little Tom, undoubtedly many are preserved deep within the sandstone layers on the property.|$|E
50|$|When {{the fate}} of the quarry site became uncertain, the teens {{came up with a plan}} to prevent the site from being developed. They made a cast from a {{footprint}} of <b>Eubrontes</b> <b>Giganteus</b> and sent that to President Richard Nixon to get support. Eventually, the quarry was split. The most productive portion was preserved and donated to the Essex County Park Commission and named after Walter Kidde. The rest of the quarry was later developed into Nob Hill apartments. In June 1971, the preserved site was registered as a National Natural Landmark.|$|E
40|$|<b>Eubrontes</b> <b>giganteus</b> is {{a common}} ichnospecies of large dinosaur track in the Early Jurassic rocks of the Hartford and Deerfield basins in Connecticut and Massachusetts, USA. It has been {{proposed}} that the trackmaker was gregarious based on parallel trackways at a site in Massachusetts known as Dinosaur Footprint Reservation (DFR). The gregariousness hypothesis {{is not without its}} problems, however, since parallelism can be caused by barriers that direct animal travel. We tested the gregariousness hypothesis by examining the orientations of trackways at five sites representing permanent and ephemeral lacustrine environments. Parallelism is only prominent in permanent lacustrine rocks at DFR, where trackways show a bimodal orientation distribution that approximates the paleoshoreline. By contrast, parallel trackways are uncommon in ephemeral lacustrine facies, even at sites with large numbers of trackways, and those that do occur exhibit differences in morphology, suggesting that they were made at different times. Overall, the evidence presented herein suggests that parallelism seen in Hartford Basin <b>Eubrontes</b> <b>giganteus</b> is better explained {{as a response to the}} lake acting as a physical barrier rather than to gregariousness. Consequently, these parallel trackways should not be used as evidence to support the hypothesis that the trackmaker was a basal sauropodomorph unless other evidence can substantiate the gregariousness hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|Olsen et al. (1), in a {{detailed}} study of skeletal remains and fossil footprints in the Newark Supergroup of eastern North America, found that Triassic theropods there were all of small to moderate size, whereas large theropod bones and footprints such as <b>Eubrontes</b> <b>giganteus</b> (� 35 cm long) did not appear until the earliest Jurassic. From that evidence, they inferred that the maximum body size of theropods increased significantly {{at the start of}} the Jurassic, perhaps in response to the elimination of nondinosaurian competitors in a mass extinction at the close of the Triassic. An alternative explanation—that big theropods had immigrated to eastern North America {{at the start of the}} Jurassic—was discounted but is actually supported by footprint evidence from the Gondwana continents...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT-The classic Early Jurassic age {{theropod}} footprints <b>Eubrontes</b> <b>giganteus.</b> Anchisauripus sillil 1 Ulni. and Grallator parallelus {{were established}} by Edward Hitchcock in 1836 - 1847 {{and are the}} type ichnospecies of their respective ichnogenera. We identify, describe, and figure the type specimens in detail {{for the first time}} since they were named. We also figure and describe the other elements of the type series as well as specimens mistakenly thought to be the types. All of the tracks corne from cyclical lacustrine and marginal lacustrine to fluvial strata from an interval spanning about one million years in the Early Jurassic age Meriden and Agawam groups of the Hartford and Deerfield basins of Connecticut and Massachusetts. Based on osteometric comparisons with skeletal material, these three ichnospecies were most likely made by theropod dinosaurs, as usually assumed. Although treated here as distinct ichnogenera, it is possible that their major proportional differences derive from allometric growth with individuals of several related species in one genus or even within one species of trackmaker. The rigorous establishment of these classic ichnological taxa forms a basis for more wide ranging studies of theropod diversity in the early Mesozoic...|$|E
