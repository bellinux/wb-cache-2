40|$|The {{collimation}} {{based on}} bent crystals represents {{an opportunity to}} increase the cleaning efficiency and reduce the beam impedance in high energy accelerators, starting from LHC, whose luminosity is now limited (at the 40 % of the nominal value) by the collimation system. The basic idea of the crystal based collimation is to replace the amorphous primary collimator with a silicon bent crystal able to deflect the beam halo outside the beam towards an absorber. The UA 9 experiment is testing this scheme on the CERN SPS circulating beam. The 120 GeV/c proton beam is stimulated to create a halo that impinges on the selected crystal; the particles deflected by the crystal are directed on to a tungsten absorber located ~ 70 m after. The experiment combines the standard beam diagnostic system (beam loss monitors and <b>ionisation</b> <b>detectors)</b> with a silicon microstrip tracking system that will be placed in two roman pots located between the crystal and the absorber.

40|$|Measurements of {{the rates}} of {{pressure}} rise and a photo&raphic study of the flames emerging from the maximum experimental safe gap apparatus have shown that although relief venting may reduce the maximum explosion pressure it may increase the rate of pressure rise within the time interval when the reaction zone and following hot combustion products are flowing through the flange gap. In some explosions {{the presence of the}} relief caused acoustic standing waves, and the resultant movement of gas interfered with the combustion wave. Schlieren and direct photographs of the transmitterr explosions have shown that, in vented explosions, transmission through a flange gap need not necessarily occur nearest to the igniting source, and in some cases ignition took place in two locations simultaneously. With ethylene/air and propane/air mixtures the transmissions occurred during the initial stages of the explosion. With hydrogen/ air mixtures the transmission of the explosion occurred when the explosion pressure reached 25 per cent of the peak value. As the location of the explosion transmission through a flange gap is largely unpredictable, the timing of the newly formed flame front outside the vessel with <b>ionisation</b> <b>detectors</b> opposite the igniting source may be inaccurate.
