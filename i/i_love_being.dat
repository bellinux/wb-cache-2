5|$|Avril {{talked about}} her life and what things were {{important}} to her – she was {{the inspiration for the}} song :-) :-). Matthew began creating the melody and track, and I started working on the lyrics.

Anyway, we finally finished the lyric, then we completed the demo.|$|E

5000|$|Their {{first two}} {{children}} (Melinda and Julian) were born {{before he became}} prime minister. Their third child, Deborah, was born in 1972, during McMahon's term as prime minister. As a prime ministerial spouse from March 1971 to December 1972, Sonia McMahon organised for a nanny {{to look after the}} children at the family home in the Sydney suburb of Bellevue Hill, while she lived with her husband at The Lodge, Canberra, attending official duties. In an interview with her biographer, Sonia McMahon said: [...] "It was a hard decision. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>being</b> with Bill and <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>being</b> a mum. But I knew I had to make a decision, and I chose to be with my husband." ...|$|R

500|$|Fagerbakke {{referred}} to Patrick as [...] "AquaDauber" [...] (a {{reference to his}} role as Michael [...] "Dauber" [...] Dybinski on the 1990s sitcom Coach) {{in the first few}} years of working on the show. Patrick is [...] "enormously entertaining to portray" [...] because, according to Fagerbakke, [...] "when I'm performing Patrick, there are many secrets that I could never divulge". Fagerbakke's approach in voicing Patrick is [...] "much the same way I would do [...] any kind of character." [...] "I'm always looking for opportunities to explore that freewheeling imagination and insanity of children. To be able to plug in to that and let that carry you in to a performance is such a gas, I have so much fun with that. I love kids; I raised two girls and <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>being</b> a parent," [...] he said. The cast members record as a whole cast. Fagerbakke says that the situation improves his performance as a voice actor because [...] "there is something remarkable that happens when people are working together that is unique to that." [...] Fagerbakke modeled his performance whenever Patrick is angry after that of American actress Shelley Winters.|$|E
500|$|Having {{refused to}} betray Yaotl in {{exchange}} for serving the Generals, April, Casey and the Foot Clan work together, searching for the final monster, the Sea Monster, while the Turtles fight the generals. Splinter and Yaotl fight off numerous monsters emerging from the portal. April, Casey and Karai arrive at the tower with the Sea Monster.

She {{and the rest of}} the Foot Clan depart. Yaotl, now mortal, honors the Turtles and Splinter, thanking them for fulfilling his wish before dissipating. Splinter places Yaotl's helmet among his trophy collection, as well as Raphael's [...] "Nightwatcher" [...] helmet and Michelangelo's [...] "Cowabunga Carl" [...] head. As they return to their roles as the shadowy guardians of New York City, Raphael says that the Turtles will always be brothers.

500|$|Fatboy {{is one of}} four {{characters}} {{created for}} the first series of the EastEnders online spin-off EastEnders: E20 who also appear in the main show, along with ZsaZsa, Leon and Mercy. Fatboy, along with the other characters from E20, was created by the show's thirteen writers during a summer school run by the BBC in August 2009. Open auditions for the cast were held at Theatre Royal Stratford East. Norwood's casting was announced on 25 November 2009, on which he said [...] "I am so excited to be on the show. It's an honour to now be part of a show that has been on in my house for as long as I have been alive. I am born and bred in the East End—a stone's throw from the real Albert Square. It feels like a homecoming. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>being</b> part of a cast that feels like family and can't wait to have a scene in The Vic." [...] Kenny, who {{was also one of the}} writers, said a character like Fatboy would not have appeared in EastEnders had he not been written by young people. Norwood stated in 2013 that being from east London and playing a character from east London meant that he could [...] "bring the truth to that character from the knowledge I have. [...] try and bring the truth out of that instead of doing it from an outside perspective." ...|$|E
50|$|I liked school. I {{got a lot}} of {{approval}} there. Except when it came to sport. I was uninterested. I preferred to read...My interest in theatre started at school. They used to have a concert every year. The first half would be items by individuals or groups and the second half would be a play. I was in two or three plays and <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> it. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>being</b> someone else even if it was only for a short time.|$|R
5000|$|Pam {{revealed}} in a UK interview that {{she no longer}} would {{want to live in}} Australia. “Well, <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>being</b> back there, and I’ll probably get killed for this, but I don’t think I could live out there anymore!... Don’t get me wrong, it’s so nice to go home and spend time there, but after living in London and New York, I think my attention span has been shortened--I need more.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Dotrice recalled, [...] "He {{was how he}} looked—an imp, and <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>being</b> his shadow. <b>I</b> can't imagine {{making movies}} would have been half as much fun without him. He <b>loved</b> <b>being</b> naughty, finding and jumping off of small {{buildings}} on the back lot. While I was Victorian proper and wouldn't let myself get dirty or muddy, Matthew had {{a great sense of}} fun and danger. He was a daredevil and could have been a race car driver. And he did live a full life over his 21 years." ...|$|R

2500|$|On 16 October 2012, his 50th birthday, Flea gave an {{interview}} with CNN discussing the Chili Peppers and {{was asked if he}} plans to continue with them. Flea responded by saying [...] "I love the Chili Peppers, and I would love to. If there's anything I know, it's every time you start making plans, you don't know what's going to come up next. Anything can happen. So <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>being</b> in the Chili Peppers and it's my home, and I've been doing it for more than half my life. Of course, during the course of doing it, there's been all kinds of ups and downs, and moments of extreme (positivity), floating on clouds of greatness, and times of just groveling, and misery, and uncertainty, and anger, and love and all those things. Like being in a family. I really can't predict. But <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>being</b> in it for now, and right now, about as far as I'm thinking is getting through this tour that we're doing, performing at the highest level possible, then hunkering down and writing another record." ...|$|E
50|$|So here I am, this is it, this is me, I {{am alone}} now.

2500|$|GameZone's Louis Bedigian {{scored the}} game 8.4 out of 10, feeling [...] "Dark Cloud 2 {{includes}} many annoyances {{that were not}} present in the first game, such as a longer, cheesier storyline; dorkier characters; and voice-overs that are so traumatizing you'll think you were watching an episode of Blue's Clues." [...] He concluded that [...] "For all its annoyances, Dark Cloud 2 is still a really, really good game. [...] I love the battles, I love the Georama system, and <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>being</b> able to build my own weapons. But I am also very disappointed in the direction that was taken with the story. Most PlayStation 2 owners are adults [...] The gameplay is so challenging that it's unlikely that a six-year-old will even care about it. But the childish voices are so annoying that this game will almost certainly turn off {{a large number of}} hardcore gamers who would have otherwise loved it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alternate identities {{presented}} include [...] "Damita Jo", {{an aggressive}} persona mentioned during the album's title track and [...] "Sexhibition", and [...] "Strawberry", a lascivious performer who emerges on [...] "Strawberry Bounce". Speaking about the personae, Jackson said [...] "She's {{another way to}} express and expose a deeper part of me." [...] "Damita Jo" [...] is [...] "a lot harsher, and quick {{to put you in}} your place. She doesn't sit and ponder about stuff, where I'll go, 'Should I or shouldn't I?' She's tougher than I am. Then there's Strawberry. She's the most sexual of them all, the wildest." [...] Blender magazine commented the latter identity represents [...] "a time when she doesn't need to be the polite, professional Janet, and can turn into raw, unrestrained Strawberry." [...] Jackson added [...] "It's not an everyday indulgence. Not even every week. But every now and then I like playing around in that mode." [...] Jackson said the characters [...] "absolutely" [...] live inside of her, exclaiming [...] "it feels wonderful" [...] to release them. The concept is further explored in [...] "Looking for Love", in which Jackson says every individual is composed of [...] "many people rolled into one," [...] unified by a similar motive of seeking love, companionship, or identity. Jackson previously desired to record an album which was a [...] "complete departure" [...] from what she is known for and title it after her middle name, but was convinced to use the title for the album by producer Dallas Austin. The title was initially used as self-acceptance; saying [...] "My mother made up [...] "Damita." [...] I presumed [...] "Jo" [...] was for Joseph, my father, even though I later learned it wasn't. Because he was emotionally withdrawn, I was never comfortable using it. For years I didn't. Now <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>being</b> called Jo. I've come to the point where I'm trying to accept - even embrace - everything that has happened to me. I believe that without acceptance there's no serenity." ...|$|E

It can make no difference to me. I have had dreams perhaps of a great future, of being the wife of a Prime Minister who would lead his country into a new era of prosperity, who would put the last rivets into the bonds of a great imperial empire. But one never realizes all one's hopes, Lawrence. I love politics. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>being</b> behind the scenes, and helping to move the pawns across the board.

5000|$|Vincent married Herb Sandker on Christmas Eve, 1983.
