25|$|A {{succession}} of controversial political appointments {{to the highest}} offices of the Institutions of the European Union - who have failed to garner favourable public opinion for their vision of the European project and demonstrate leadership required to steer the European project - has resulted in successful electoral challenges to prevent any further devolution of sovereignty from the national parliaments to the Institutions of the European Union in Brussels. European electorates have become deeply suspicious of the <b>democratic</b> <b>deficit,</b> corporate lobbying activities and opacity of political arrangements brokered in Brussels.

Arguing that the world {{is in the middle of}} a transition from the American Empire to the rule of a global ruling class that has emerged from within the American Empire, they point out that right-wing populist conspiracy theorists, blinded by their anti-communism, fail to see is that what they demonize as the [...] "New World Order" [...] is, ironically, the highest stage of the very capitalist economic system they defend.|$|E

40|$|Stakeholder' {{has become}} the primary {{category}} of political actor in decision-making, not least within nature conservation. Drawing from Habermas' theory on communicative action, this article argues that there are <b>democratic</b> <b>deficits</b> to the stakeholder model that promote citizens {{to remain locked in}} predetermined, polarized positions. It contends that the stakeholder model must, hence, be scrutinized with respect to its potential role in perpetuating conservation conflicts in modernity. Using the case study of stakeholder-based game management delegations (GMDs) in Sweden, our research identifies four barriers, which tie to the instrumental basis and liberal democratic legacy of the stakeholder approach: 1) strong sense of accountability; 2) overly purposive atmosphere; 3) overemphasis on decision as final outcome; and 4) perceived inability {{on the part of the}} delegates to influence science-led decision-making. The article suggests that these <b>democratic</b> <b>deficits</b> preclude the deliberation and contestation necessary to legitimate conservation policy. Indeed, stakeholder rationality causes citizens to become inert, instrumental agents who approach discussion with strategic rather than communicative rationality. We conclude that the deficits of the stakeholder model currently: 1) restrict democratic freedom for citizens; 2) engender a crisis of legitimacy of management; and 3) reproduce the conflict, which in Sweden relates to the conservation of wolves...|$|R

Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski said in 2009 that the asymmetric devolution {{in place in the}} UK has created a <b>democratic</b> <b>deficit</b> for England. This is more commonly known as the West Lothian question, which cites the anomaly where English MPs cannot vote on affairs devolved to Scotland, but Scottish MPs can vote on the equivalent subjects in England.

Often, politically interested and motivated citizens are confronted with the concepts ‘democracy’, ‘politics’ and ‘democratic elections’ in various newspapers or on TV news. Moreover, there are intense debates about <b>democratic</b> <b>deficits,</b> {{and an increase in}} extremism is feared if the civic education young people receive is not enhanced. For these reasons, I intend to address the questions of how knowledge about politics is effectively provided through civic education and to show the impact political commitment has on young people by discussing the concepts of civic education, learning democracy and political participation...|$|R

The paper canvasses a number of pitfalls of CIR. These include: their potential to aggravate rather than ameliorate the democratic deficit; the problems associated with under-deliberation; and potentially detrimental consequences for existing electoral arrangements. Specifically, CIR could engender voter fatigue, reduce the salience of elections and exacerbate levels of ungovernability and accountability, all of which are known to turn people off politics and voting.

40|$|This {{collection}} explores how {{principles and}} practices of democracy are elaborated and implemented within the global justice movement, both in their internal organization and in experiments of public decision-making. The issue of internal democracy is particularly relevant for a multifaceted and heterogeneous movement which has denounced the <b>democratic</b> <b>deficits</b> of decision-making processes and {{stressed the need for}} radical democratic reforms. In addition, and in part as a response to these demands for greater levels of citizen participation, experiments in participatory and deliberative forms of democracy are underway. Taking an empirical perspective, this collection investigates the development of new conceptions {{and practices of}} democracy, integrating research into approximately 250 European and transnational social movement organizations...|$|R
2500|$|The Scottish {{government}} and pro-independence campaigners {{said that a}} <b>democratic</b> <b>deficit</b> existed in Scotland because the UK was a unitary state {{that did not have}} a codified constitution. The SNP also described the unelected House of Lords as an [...] "affront to democracy". The [...] "democratic deficit" [...] label has sometimes been used to refer to the period between the 1979 and 1997 UK general elections, during which the Labour Party held a majority of Scottish seats but the Conservative Party governed the whole of the UK. Alex Salmond said in September 2013 that instances such as this amounted to a lack of democracy, and that [...] "the people who live and work in Scotland are the people most likely to make the right choices for Scotland". In January 2012, Patrick Harvie said: [...] "Greens have a vision of a more radical democracy in Scotland, with far greater levels of discussion and decision making at community level." [...] The Scottish Government intended that an independent Scotland should have a written constitution which [...] "expresses our values, embeds the rights of our citizens and sets out clearly how our institutions of state interact with each other and serve the people".|$|E

40|$|People {{have tended}} to load their {{different}} conceptions of democracy with their own political ideals; in this paper {{it is argued that}} normative and definitional questions should rather be separated, so that political philosophers and political scientists may adopt the same concept of democracy, even if they disagree normatively or politically. Moreover, it is argued that we should replace an absolute notion of democracy by a relativized notion, which allows for different degrees of democraticity. This facilitates the separation of normative and conceptual issues and it is convenient in contexts in which “democratic deficits” are discussed – as e. g. when democracy is to be implemented on a supranational level. Moreover, it has the consequence that <b>democratic</b> <b>deficits</b> are not necessarily bad. DOWNLOAD THIS PAPER FROM SSRN : [URL] </p...|$|R
40|$|Political {{participation}} beyond elections is {{a recurrent}} {{subject in the}} analysis of politics at the domestic level. Since the beginning of the 1990 s, official discourses and academic research increasingly underlines the capacities of NGO participation in decision-making to reduce the major <b>democratic</b> <b>deficits</b> that have grown during the recent decades in the governance of global relations. The emergence of this participatory discourse has fundamental consequences for the strategies, the power and the organisational structures of non-state actors. We argue that this discourse has led to increasing inclusion of non-state actor participation in decision making processes. What follows is a process of professionalization and adaptation of nongovernmental non-profit actors. The aim of our contribution is to develop a conceptual framework which prepares the ground for the empirical analysis of this particular topic...|$|R

40|$|In {{citizenship}} education, tensions {{exist between}} pedagogical goals and students’ perspectives. This article investigates the discrepancies and commonalities between the theoretical positions and young people’s lived citizenship, especially concerning their conceptual and social foundations. Two theoretical positions on democratic citizenship development and one Dutch student’s {{sense of his}} civic self are compared. Our findings indicate that the theoretical positions are less suitable to detect and appreciate more subtle ways in which young people already do contribute to democracy in their everyday lives. Secondly, they indicate that democratic citizenship education needs to attend more to students’ perceptions of a need to contribute and to develop their citizenship identities. Two complementary approaches are suggested: investigating more subtle ways in which students already do contribute, and raising student’s awareness of <b>democratic</b> <b>deficits...</b>|$|R
40|$|This review {{documents}} how scholarly {{concern with}} <b>democratic</b> <b>deficits</b> in American constitutionalism {{has shifted from}} the courts to electoral institutions. Prominent political scientists are increasingly rejecting the countermajoritarian difficulty as the proper framework for studying and evaluating judicial power. Political scientists, who study Congress and the presidency, however, have recently emphasized countermajoritarian difficulties with electoral institutions. Realistic normative appraisals of American political institutions, this emerging literature on constitutional politics in the United States maintains, should begin by postulating a set of democratic and constitutional goods, {{determine the extent to}} which American institutions as a whole are delivering those goods, and either explain how the political system as a whole might be redesigned to better deliver those goods or accept second-best constitutional goods that can actually be delivered by some attainable combination of political institutions...|$|R

To this end, we present our democratic engagement typology and its derivation from empirical and conceptual research, and discuss several strengths and limitations of each type of engagement. We also explain the additive value of our typology in relation to existing engagement typologies, and conclude that in order to vitalize democratic communities, local and (inter) national communities and institutions also need to cultivate a thick type of democratic engagement among European youth...|$|R

40|$|The {{involvement}} {{of civil society}} organizations (CSOs) is widely regarded by students of the EU’s domestic policy fields as enhancing transparency and accountability and, more generally, the democratic quality of political processes. This article explores the contribution of CSOs to the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy and assesses whether a democracy-enhancing effect of their involvement can also be demonstrated for this policy field. We analyse the contribution of CSOs based on two common models of democracy: the intergovernmental and the supranational model of democracy. We find that CSOs are indeed quite {{actively involved in the}} EU’s security policy. With regard to their democracy-enhancing effects, however, our findings are rather mixed.

The letter’s implication is obvious: had more robust democratic institutions been in place, the war between Russia and Georgia might not have occurred. In this paper, I argue that U.

Once Saakashvili took office, Washington reduced funding to critical democratization programs, especially those that supported independent media and civil society organizations. This shift in U. S. assistance, which contributed to the slowdown of democratic consolidation in Georgia, demonstrates that U. S. aid is critical to Georgia’s political development. " [...] from pages 69 - 7...|$|R
