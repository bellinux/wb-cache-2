50|$|The R22 uses a {{horizontally}} mounted Lycoming O-320 (O-360-J2A on the Beta II), four-cylinder, air-cooled, normally aspirated, carburetor-equipped piston engine. It {{is fueled}} with 100LL grade aviation gasoline. Cooling is provided through a direct drive squirrel-cage cooling fan. At sea level it is derated, or operated {{at less than}} maximum power, which {{has been attributed to}} the company wishing for the power unit to maintain the same performance at sea level as it does at altitude. As the air becomes thinner with increasing altitude, maximum available horsepower decreases, reaching a point where the throttle can be completely open and rotor RPM is controlled by collective position. By <b>derating</b> the <b>engine</b> at sea level, the R22 achieves acceptable high-altitude performance without use of supercharging or turbocharging, thus saving the weight, cost, complexity, unreliability, and shortened engine life of a forced induction system.|$|R

2500|$|The DH.9's {{performance}} in action over the Western Front was typically deemed {{to have been}} a disaster; heavy losses of the type were quickly incurred, attributed to both its poor performance and to engine failures, despite the prior <b>derating</b> of its <b>engine</b> to reduce the failure rate. Between May and November 1918, a pair of squadrons stationed at the Western Front (Nos. 99 and 104) had 54 of its DH.9s shot down and another 94 aircraft written off due to accidents. On multiple occasions, less than half of a flight of bombers would reach their intended targets; according to Bruce, the successful missions performed by the DH.9 were frequently a product of [...] "the courage and determination of the pilots and observers that flew them".

The potential {{of each of these}} technologies is examined individually and in combination.

It is important to note that the control technologies discussed in this report have received limited evaluation in underground mines.

40|$|Most micro gas {{turbines}} (MGTs) are currently operated with {{natural gas and}} biogas. However, MGTs are generally able to operate {{on a variety of}} different gaseous and liquid fuels, including natural gas, biogas, syngas, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel fuel/distillate heating oil. Compared to piston engines micro {{gas turbines}} can oxidize fuels with very low heating value without <b>engine</b> <b>derating.</b> The combustion systems of micro gas turbines can also be designed in a way that fuels with lower Methane Number as well as gases with heavier hydrocarbon components can be easily burned. The same is true for fuels containing hydrogen. The presentation focusses on the MGT combustor research & development within the German Aerospace Center in terms of fuel flexibility. The developed combustion systems are based on the FLOX® (flameless oxidation) concept. Latest results include the operation with wood gas (coupling of wood gasifier and MGT) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Also, combustion systems with high operation flexibility able to oxidize SOFC off gas and natural gas (hybrid power plant: coupling of SOFC and MGT) or biogas and natural gas using the same design are presented. The development of the combustion systems is based on computational fluid dynamics simulations using detailed chemistry for modelling the combustion process.

40|$|The {{effects of}} using neat FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester) {{in a modern}} small {{displacement}} passenger car diesel engine have been evaluated in this paper. In particular the effects on engine performance at full load with standard (i. e. without any special tuning) ECU calibration were analyzed, highlighting some issues in the low end torque due to the lower exhaust gas temperatures at the turbine inlet, which caused a remarkable decrease of the available boost, with a substantial decrease of the engine torque output, far beyond the expected <b>engine</b> <b>derating</b> due to the lower LHV of the fuel. However, further tests carried out after ECU recalibration, showed that the same torque levels measured under Diesel operation can be obtained with neat biodiesel too, thus highlighting the potential for maintaining {{the same level of}} performance. Moreover, the effects of FAME on brake specific fuel consumption and on engine out exhaust emissions (CO 2, CO, HC, NOx and PM) were also evaluated at 7 different part load operating conditions, representative of the New European Driving Cycle. Both standard and specifically adjusted engine calibrations were evaluated for part load operating conditions, highlighting a 13 % average rise of fuel consumption, on a mass basis, at same fuel conversion efficiency and CO 2 emissions. A remarkable increase of CO and HC emissions at low load could be noticed, along with an almost negligible increase in NOx emissions when using a specifically adjusted engine calibration, and a considerable smoke emission reductio...|$|R
40|$|This aims to {{find the}} {{potentiality}} of introducing absorption chiller systems to improve the diesel power plant performance in Sri Lanka. The energy efficient operation of diesel power plants is very much important for the country due to {{the high cost of}} generation of thermal electricity. Therefore waste heat of diesel power plant is utilized to run a suitable absorption chiller. The considered waste heat is mainly of exhaust and cooling water in the diesel engines of the power plant. The performance of the power generating diesel engines is considered in two ways. That is in terms of specific fuel oil consumption (SFC) and engine deration. The SFC of the engines varies due to many factors. Since the site conditions in Sri Lanka are not in standard conditions the higher SFC and engine deration is possible. The ISO standard site conditions mean the 25 oC (77 oF) ambient temperature, 30 % relative humidity and a model was developed to evaluate the performance of particular engines. All the temperature values in the model are given in Fahrenheit degrees (oF). It is observed that the engine SFC is low and the <b>engine</b> will not <b>derate</b> at the standard site conditions. From the model it is obvious that when the ambient temperature is 70 oF (21. 1 oC) the <b>engine</b> will not <b>derate</b> due to the effect of humidity even though the percentage of relative humidity reaches 100. In contrast, above 133. 6 oF (56. 4 oC) ambient temperature the power plant diesel <b>engines</b> <b>derate</b> due to the effect of humidity irrespective of the value of percentage relative humidity. The investigated model was applied to evaluate the improved performance of a diesel power plant by introducing an absorption chiller system. The building cooling load was additionally integrated to that system. Therefore it further uplifts the advantages by saving electricity of vapour compression air conditioners...|$|R
