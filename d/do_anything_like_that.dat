2500|$|Foley said in {{his first}} book that his wife cried during a post-match phone {{conversation}} between the two, and this made Foley strongly consider retiring from wrestling.

[...] Many evangelical leaders initially showed support for Haggard and were critical of media reports, including James Dobson who issued a statement of support for Haggard, which stated: [...] "It is unconscionable that the legitimate news media would report a rumor like this based on nothing but one man's accusation.... Ted Haggard is a friend of mine, and it appears someone is trying to damage his reputation as a way of influencing the outcome of Tuesday's election [...] especially the vote on Colorado's marriage-protection amendment, which Ted strongly supports." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Rusty Cage" [...] {{was written}} by {{frontman}} Chris Cornell. Guitarist Kim Thayil on the song:The tuning on that song was pretty nutty. It's recorded with a wah wah in the low position used as a filter. That {{was the first time}} we <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> It was Chris's idea; he wanted to get that weird tone that you can't really dial in on an amp. But if you use the wah wah as a filter, it gets an incredibly weird sound. And if you listen to that riff, especially if you've heard the original demos of it, it almost sounds backward.|$|R

2500|$|At times, {{the healing}} {{services}} were criticized in mainstream media and on Internet blogs {{for the occasional}} violence done to the participants, {{in the tradition of}} Smith Wigglesworth. Todd Bentley was known to forcefully kick, hit, smack or knock over participants. In one incident, a man was knocked over and lost a tooth. In another, an elderly woman was intentionally kicked in the face. Bentley held that the Holy Spirit led him to such actions, saying that those incidents were taken out of context and adding that miracles were happening simultaneously.
