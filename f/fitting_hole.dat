50|$|A {{basin wrench}} {{consists}} of a long shaft {{with a pair of}} asymmetrical jaws at one end and a transverse handle at the other end. The two jaws form an assembly in which the jaws are joined with a pivot pin. One of the jaws is fixed relative to the shaft, and the other is curved and spring-loaded relative to the fixed jaw so that it will automatically close and grip the fastener. When the shaft is turned in the direction that causes the curved jaw to trail the pivot pin, the jaws will increase their grip on the fastener as shaft torque increases, thereby allowing the operator to apply torque to the fastener without slippage. The transverse handle passes through a loosely <b>fitting</b> <b>hole</b> in the shaft {{so that it can be}} shifted to conform to tight spaces or to elongate it so as to increase leverage.|$|E
40|$|To achieve {{accurate}} measurements, the {{creating a}} <b>fitting</b> <b>hole</b> for internal diameter (CFHID) measurement method and the establishing multi-sectional curve for external diameter (EMCED) measurement method are proposed in this paper, {{which are based}} on computer vision principle and three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction. The methods are able to highlight the 3 D characteristics of the scanned object and to achieve the accurate measurement of 3 D data. It can create favorable conditions for realizing the reverse design and 3 D reconstruction of scanned object. These methods can also be applied to dangerous work environment or the occasion that traditional contact measurement can not meet the demands, and they can improve the security in measuremen...|$|E
40|$|Described is a {{foldable}} expandable pallet for Space Station interface attachments {{with a basic}} square configuration. Each pallet {{consists of}} a series of struts joined together by node point fittings to make a rigid structure. The struts have hinge fittings which are spring loaded to permit collapse of the module for stowage transport to a Space Station in the payload bay of the Space Shuttle, and development on orbit. Dimensions of the pallet are selected to provide convenient, closely spaced attachment points between the node points of the relatively widely spaced trusses of a Space Station platform. A pallet is attached to a strut at four points: one close <b>fitting</b> <b>hole,</b> two oversize holes, and a slot to allow for thermal expansion/contraction and for manufacturing tolerances. Applications of the pallet include its use in rotary or angular joints; servicing of splints; with gridded plates; as instrument mounting bases; and as a roadbed for a Mobile Service Center (MSC) ...|$|E

On one of the sides, the top corner is colored red and has a cut-it-out mechanism which creates a <b>hole</b> <b>fitting</b> a 355 can for its extraction, leaving the pack still together.|$|R
40|$|Octopuses {{have large}} brains and exhibit complex behaviors, but {{relatively}} {{little is known}} about their cognitive abilities. Here we present data from a five-level learning and problem-solving experiment. Seven octopuses (Octopus vulgaris) were first trained to open an L shaped container to retrieve food (level 0). After learning the initial task all animals followed the same experimental protocol, first they had to retrieve this L shaped container, presented at the same orientation, through a tight <b>fitting</b> <b>hole</b> in a clear Perspex partition (level 1). This required the octopuses to perform both pull and release or push actions. After reaching criterion the animals advanced to the next stage of the test, which would be a different consistent orientation of the object (level 2) {{at the start of the}} trial, an opaque barrier (level 3) or a random orientation of the object (level 4). All octopuses were successful in reaching criterion in all levels of the task. At the onset of each new level the performance of the animals dropped, shown as an increase in working times. However, they adapted quickly so that overall working times were not significantly different between levels. Our findings indicate that octopuses show behavioral flexibility by quickly adapting to a change in a task. This can be compared to tests in other species where subjects had to conduct actions comprised of a set of motor actions that cannot be understood by a simple learning rule alone...|$|E

30|$|PSNR is {{calculated}} {{to compare the}} quality of rendered view using processed depth versus that of using original depth [10]. It essentially measures how close the rendered view is to the 'ideal' one. In our calculations, pixels, dis-occluded during the rendering process, are excluded so to make the comparison independent on the particular <b>hole</b> <b>fitting</b> approach. For color images, we calculate PSNR independently for each color channel and then calculate the mean between three channels.|$|R
50|$|Siege {{artillery}} limbers, unlike {{field artillery}} limbers, {{did not have}} an ammunition chest. Siege artillery limbers resembled their predecessors: they were two-wheeled carts with a pintle, now somewhat behind the axle. When the piece was to be hauled, the trail was raised above the limber, then lowered, with the pintle <b>fitting</b> into a <b>hole</b> in the trail. Unlike the situation with its predecessors, horses were harnessed to the 19th-century limber in pairs, with six to ten horses needed to haul a siege gun or howitzer.|$|R
25|$|Each {{player has}} 16 spatula-shaped pieces with a bottom end <b>fitting</b> into the <b>holes</b> of the board. One player has pieces that are rather wide and thin; {{whereas the other}} player's pieces are more obelisk-shaped. At the {{beginning}} of the game, player A's pieces are placed in the holes of row A so that the spatulas are perpendicular to the row (un-dalled), and equivalently for player B. Later in the game, the pieces will be turned (fordallede, or dalled) so that the spatula is parallel to the rows.|$|R
5000|$|As {{artillery}} pieces developed trunnions {{and were}} placed on carriages featuring two wheels and a trail, a limber was devised. This was a simple cart with a pintle. When the piece was to be towed, it was raised over the limber and then lowered, with the pintle <b>fitting</b> into a <b>hole</b> in the trail. Horses or other draft animals were harnessed in single file to haul the limber. [...] There was no provision for carrying ammunition on the limber, but an ammunition chest was often carried between the two pieces of the trail.|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the magnetic-field and {{concentration}} dependences of the magnetizations of the hole and Mn subsystems in diluted ferromagnetic semiconductor Ga 1 -xMnxAs. A mean-field approximation to the hole-mediated interaction is used, in which the hole concentration p(x) is parametrized {{in terms of a}} <b>fitting</b> (of the <b>hole</b> effective mass and hole/local moment coupling) to experimental data on the T-c critical temperature. The dependence of the magnetizations with x, for a given temperature, presents a sharply peaked structure; with maxima increasing with applied magnetic field, which indicates that application to diluted-magnetic-semiconductor devices would require quality control of the Mn-doping composition. We also compare various experimental data for T-c(x) and p(x) on different Ga 1 -xMnxAs samples and stress the need of further detailed, experimental work to assure that the experimental measurements are reproducible.

40|$|The nuclear star {{clusters}} of late-type spiral galaxies are comprised of multiple components. Gemini near-infrared spectroscopy {{of the nuclear}} star cluster in NGC 4244 shows clear rotation. Earlier, De Lorenzi et al. (2013) constructed two component (disc + spheroid) axisymmetric three integral particle models of NGC 4244, finding a negative vertical anisotropy (βz < 0). We construct a series of axisymmetric, single-component, particle models of NGC 4244 using these data, combined with F 814 W band photometric data from the Hubble space telescope and the χ 2 -made-to-measure code NMAGIC. We find a best <b>fitting</b> central black <b>hole</b> mass of 5 x 105 M⊙. Our models also have a negative βz, as in earlier models. We conclude that although the disc component of NGC 4244 ’s nuclear star cluster is clearly present, it has a negligible effect on the measured kinematics. We also present a preliminary density model for the nuclear star cluster residing in the pure spiral galaxy M 33...|$|R
40|$|Some recent {{literature}} has considered the holographic-induced cosmology of a brane universe {{in the background}} of an anti-de Sitter-black hole geometry. In this regard, curved-brane scenarios have only just begun to receive attention. Our current interest is in a formal discrepancy that exists between two such works (hep-th/ 0111247 and hep-th/ 0111276). After a more general review, we clarify this issue and discuss the implications on the prior results. 1 Much of current gravitational physics has been influenced by the intriguing concept of “holography ” [1, 2]. The underlying principle, which has followed closely from the original “Bekenstein bound ” [3], is based on the notion that the maximal entropy that can be stored within a given volume will be determined by the largest black <b>hole</b> <b>fitting</b> inside of that volume. Since the entropy of a black hole is essentially given by its (outer-horizon) surface area [4, 5], it follows directly that all relevant degrees of freedom of any system must (in some sense) live on a boundary enclosing that system...|$|R
6000|$|She was {{clothed in}} {{garments}} {{of the richest}} description, which glittered with gold embroidery and jewels. Seated thus, stroking the cat, and with a self-satisfied smile on her fat pretty face, she seemed the very personification of contentment. Her soft brown neck was almost hidden with rows of pearls, and long rows of the same jewels depended from the high filigree cap which towered above her head. Her dress consisted of three open jackets or short caftans, one above the other, without sleeves. These were profusely garnished with gold lace, and fastened only at the waist. White linen trousers or drawers covered her limbs to the ankles, but these were so immensely wide as to bear more resemblance to female drapery than to the masculine appendages which their name suggests. A silken, gold-striped shawl was fastened by two corners round her waist, and hung down in front like an apron. Sleeves of fine embroidered muslin and of great width covered her arms. Her little feet and ankles were bare, but the latter were ornamented with several thick gold leglets. In each ear she wore five large round ear-rings, two of these <b>fitting</b> into two <b>holes</b> in the lower, and three into {{the upper part of}} the ear. One awkward result of this was that the upper ear-rings pulled the ears down, and made them pendent like those of a poodle! ...|$|R
5000|$|In sailing, pintles insert into {{gudgeons}} {{that are}} normally {{affixed to the}} transom of a boat. Normally, the corresponding pintle fitting on the rudder slides, lowers or clips into the gudgeon. There are variations where gudgeons are mounted to the rudder and boat, and a pivot clevis pin is inserted into these gudgeons, or the pintles are fastened to the boat, and gudgeons {{are attached to the}} rudder. In any case, the <b>fitting</b> with the <b>hole</b> is referred to as a gudgeon. They are used to attach the rudder to the boat so that it can swing freely. The rudder can then be turned with the tiller. There must be at least two gudgeon/pintle sets for stability in the rudder's attachment to the transom. The pintles must face the same direction for insertion into the gudgeons and usually one is a bit longer so it can be the first into its gudgeon, giving some stability for the insertion of the other pintle. To prevent the rudder from rising out of the gudgeons there is often some preventer such as rudder weight or a locking device slid across the path of the pintle's removal from the upper gudgeon (also referred to as a Rudder Stop).Really good installations (gudgeons) have bushings, (plain bearing) either a solid sleeve, flanged or clenched. This will allow for smoother operation of the helm and preserve the pintles and gudgeons. A bushing can be seen as [...] "consumable".|$|R
50|$|The AR-18's {{action is}} powered by a short-stroke gas piston above the barrel. The gas piston is of 3-piece design to {{facilitate}} disassembly, with a hollow forward section with 4 radial gas vent <b>holes</b> <b>fitting</b> around a stainless steel gas block projecting rearwards from the foresight housing. The gas is vented from the barrel and travelled via a vent through the foresight housing into the hollow front section of the piston, which causes it to move rearwards a short distance. The rear end of the piston emerges through the barrel extension to contact the forward face of the bolt carrier, causing it in turn to move rearwards. The bolt itself is of similar configuration to the AR-15 with 7 radial locking lugs engaging corresponding recesses in the barrel extension, and the extractor in place of the 8th lug. The bolt is moved {{into and out of the}} locked position via a cam pin that engaged a helical slot in the bolt carrier, which rides on two metal guide rods (each with its own return spring) instead of contacting the receiver walls, providing additional clearance for foreign matter entering the receiver. Unlike the AR-15, the cocking handle fits directly into a recess in the bolt carrier and reciprocates with it during firing, allowing the firer to force the breech closed or open if necessary. The cocking handle slot has a spring-loaded cover that can be closed by the user to prevent debris entering the receiver, and it will open automatically as the bolt carrier moves rearwards after the first shot. The recoil springs are housed within the receiver, differing from the AR-15 which houses its more elaborate buffer mechanism in the buttstock. The AR-18's compact design enables the use of a side-folding stock with a hinging mechanism (which proved to be less than adequately rigid).|$|R

In this regard, curved-brane scenarios have begun to receive considerable attention. Our current interest is in a formal discrepancy that exists between two such works by Padilla (hep-th/ 0111247) and Youm (hep-th/ 0111276). In particular, these authors have incorporated different values for a conformal factor that is used to relate the thermodynamics of the relevant (AdS bulk and CFT brane) spacetimes. After a more general review, we clarify this issue and discuss the implications on the prior results. 1 Much of current gravitational physics has been influenced by the intriguing concept of “holography ” [1, 2].

Since ’t Hooft [1] and Susskind [2] originally proposed the holographic principle as being fundamental to any gravitational theory (at least at a semi-classical level), it has received its fair share of criticism. (See Ref. [6] for a review and references.) However, one undeniable success of holography has been the celebrated duality that apparently exists between anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes and conformal field theories (CFTs); that is, the AdS/CFT correspondence [7, 8, 9]. It has, in fact, been argued (and demonstrated in many instances) that the horizon thermodynamics of a given n+ 2 dimensional AdS black hole can be identified with a certain n+ 1 -dimensional CFT. Furthermore, the CFT of interest is assumed to be in a strongly coupled, high-temperature regime and to live on a timelike surface that can be identified as an asymptotic boundary of the AdS spacetime...|$|R
40|$|As {{with any}} {{language}} or dialect, Australian English {{has its share}} of idiomatic expressions in which simple-seeming words come together to produce a meaning inexplicable without cultural translation and therefore destined to mystify newcomers to the language. It might even be the reason such expressions exist in the first place. They are the linguistic equivalents of handshakes in Masonic temples, of passwords whispered to guards at fortress gates. The ones I remember being particularly baffled by – we arrived, my mum, dad and me, in Australia in 1990; my sister stayed in Europe – are “it’s my shout” (oh the stories I could tell you…) and “bring a plate” (likewise), though perhaps most puzzling of them all was a single word, unhyphenated and modestly prefixed: “overqualified”. Where we were from, you couldn’t be too educated or too experienced for a professional, skilled job. Not so in Australia, it turned out, not for new arrivals anyway. My father’s periodic removal from his résumé of his Ukrainian/Soviet PhD in hydraulics – a bizarre ritual of self-administered shrinkage, necessary, he was told, to get a “foot in the door” – has been replicated across decades by migrants to this country. Particularly by migrants from Africa, Asia, eastern Europe: the non-West guild. Melbourne writer Ralph Johnstone has told of two Somali men, Abdulkadir Shire and Ali-nur Duale, who in the course of 17 years of “downskilling” crossed out any hint of their respective Masters in petrochemical engineering and PhD in applied entomology from 300 -plus job applications. Still no joy. Because who could be less employable than an overqualified alien? Ridiculous business, this practically standing on your head not to appear too smart to prospective employers. As a migrant you are already up against it, what with the language barrier and the close-to-zero social capital and the sometimes not actually owning a pair of employment-ready pants to wear to a job interview. And then, crazily, you are compelled to hide your goods. Most people routinely inflate their capabilities in CVs (“selling themselves”, it’s called) whereas these PhDed migrants – my father, once upon a time – have been doing what, precisely? As far as I can tell they have been doing the Great Australian Undersell. The smaller you make yourself, the bigger the chance of the square peg that is (sort of) you <b>fitting</b> the round <b>hole</b> that is Australia’s jobs market. So there’s logic to it. But it is a pretty brick-like logic. Read the full article>...|$|R
