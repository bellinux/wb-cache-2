5|$|In November 1938, Blamey was {{appointed}} {{chairman of the}} Commonwealth Government's Manpower Committee and Controller General of Recruiting. As such, he {{laid the foundation for}} the expansion of the Army in the event of war with Germany or Japan, which he now regarded as <b>inevitable.</b> <b>In</b> 1938 and 1939, he headed a successful recruiting campaign which doubled the size of the part-time volunteer Militia from 35,000 in September 1938 to 70,000 in March 1939. On 5 April 1939 he married Olga Ora Farnsworth, a 35-year-old fashion artist, at St John's Anglican Church, Toorak.|$|E
5|$|In June 1938, Segrè paid {{a summer}} visit to California {{to study the}} {{short-lived}} isotopes of technetium, which did not survive being mailed to Italy. While Segrè was en route, Benito Mussolini's fascist government passed racial laws barring Jews from university positions. As a Jew, Segrè was now rendered an indefinite émigré. The Czechoslovakian crisis prompted Segrè to send for Elfriede and Claudio, as he now feared that war in Europe was <b>inevitable.</b> <b>In</b> November 1938 and February 1939 they made quick trips to Mexico to exchange their tourist visas for immigration visa. Both Segrè and Elfriede held grave fears for the fate of their parents in Italy and Germany.|$|E

5|$|Phylogenetic {{studies have}} shown that, in its current circumscription, the genus Hydnellum is polyphyletic and only distantly related to the white-spored genera Bankera and Phellodon, {{currently}} grouped together in the family Bankeraceae. Analyses of the ITS region by Parfitt and colleagues and Ainsworth and colleagues, have further revealed multiple cryptic lineages within the genus. Most of the cryptic species belong to the H. concrescens/H. scrobiculatum species complex, resulting in frequent misinterpretations of these old and widely applied names. At the moment, the number of phylogenetically distinct lineages confirmed by molecular sequencing exceeds the number of described taxa in the genus, making further taxonomic revisions <b>inevitable</b> <b>in</b> the future.|$|E
5|$|The Allies had {{confidently}} {{expected that}} victory {{in a major}} set-piece battle would compel LouisXIV to accept peace on Allied terms, but after Malplaquet (the bloodiest battle of the war), that strategy had lost its validity: Villars had only to avoid defeat for a compromise peace settlement to become <b>inevitable.</b> <b>In</b> March 1710, fresh peace talks re-opened at Geertruidenberg, but again LouisXIV would not concede Whig demands to force his grandson, PhilipV, from Spain. Publicly Marlborough toed the government line, but privately he had real doubts about pressing the French into accepting such a dishonourable course.|$|E
5|$|The Butler Stand {{roof was}} blown {{off in a}} storm in January 1976. The ground damage meant the club's next home game against Middlesbrough had to be played at Vale Park, the home of local rivals Port Vale. The repair bill, {{in the region of}} £250,000, put the club in {{financial}} trouble, which was eased by the sale of Alan Hudson, Mike Pejic and Jimmy Greenhoff for a combined sum of £440,000. With the team depleted, relegation proved <b>inevitable</b> <b>in</b> the 1976–77 season. Waddington, after a spell of 17 years in charge, left the club after a 1–0 home defeat in March 1977.|$|E

25|$|Disagreeing {{with many}} {{mainstream}} economists of the day, {{he argued that}} these swings, and the booms and busts that can accompany them, are <b>inevitable</b> <b>in</b> a so-called free market economy – unless government steps in to control them, through regulation, central bank action and other tools. Such mechanisms did in fact come into existence in response to crises such as the Panic of 1907 and the Great Depression. Minsky opposed the deregulation that characterized the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|In the Austrian view it {{was this}} {{inflation}} of the money supply that led to an unsustainable boom in both asset prices (stocks and bonds) and capital goods. By the time the Fed belatedly tightened in 1928, it was far too late and, in the Austrian view, a significant economic contraction was <b>inevitable.</b> <b>In</b> February 1929 Hayek published a paper predicting the Federal Reserve's actions {{would lead to a}} crisis starting in the stock and credit markets.|$|E

25|$|The grain {{direction}} {{can be determined}} {{by looking at the}} edge or side of the work piece. Wood fibers can be seen running out to the surface that is being planed. When the fibers meet the work surface it looks like the point of an arrow that indicates the direction.

However, PSG's form slowly declined and eventually, a split from owners Canal+ became <b>inevitable.</b> <b>In</b> 2006, Canal+ sold PSG to investment firms Colony NorthStar, Butler Capital Partners and Morgan Stanley for €41m.

25|$|In 1799, after {{a series}} of naval battles with the French (known as the Quasi-War), {{full-scale}} war seemed <b>inevitable.</b> <b>In</b> this crisis, Adams broke with his party and sent three new commissioners to France. Napoleon, who had just come to power, received them cordially, and the danger of conflict subsided with the negotiation of the Convention of 1800, which formally released the United States from its 1778 wartime alliance with France. However, reflecting American weakness, France refused to pay $20 million in compensation for American ships seized by the French navy.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, an {{effective}} defence of Canada by France requires an extraordinarily large commitment of resources {{in comparison to}} the scant economic value in return, and any resources thus expended, even if allowing victories in the short term, are wasted as they can only serve at best to postpone for a few more decades the handing over of Canada to Britain, which is <b>inevitable</b> <b>in</b> the long term. Consequently, sound economic policy dictates handing over Canada to Britain as soon as possible and concentrating France's resources in its Caribbean colonies, more valuable economically and more readily defensible.|$|E
25|$|While PAVN/VC defeat was <b>inevitable</b> <b>in</b> {{the face}} of U.S. firepower, the failure to sever the PAVN supply lines and isolate the {{battlefield}} meant that the battle lasted longer and was more costly to the ARVN and U.S. than was necessary. Until {{the last week of}} the battle the ARVN, U.S. Marines and 1st Cavalry each fought separate, largely uncoordinated battles without any unified command structure, no overall strategy and competing demands for logistics, air and artillery support. Delaying the counterattack until a clear strategy was developed and the necessary forces assembled might have reduced casualties among the ARVN, U.S. forces and civilians and shortened the battle.|$|E
25|$|The Sahel’s {{farmers have}} been largely cleared of blame for the 20th century’s Sahel {{droughts}}. The Sahel region’s droughts in the 1970s and 1980s were caused by the recent warming of the Indian Ocean, rather than by over-farming causing environmental degradation as previously assumed, {{according to a new}} joint Scidev/UN study. With both a 3.5 C. rise in the Niger's temperature over the last decade and with irrigated land accounting for only 0.1% of the Niger's inhabitable land, regular famine crisis is <b>inevitable</b> <b>in</b> most years. Acute water shortages, which are common in the region's harsh weather, make irrigation systems all the more important for the local farmers.|$|E
