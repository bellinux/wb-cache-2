40|$|<b>European</b> <b>canker</b> {{is caused}} by the fungus Neonectria ditissima (Neonectria galligena, {{formerly}} Nectria galligena). The disease causes significant losses to apple production in Sweden and many other countries with a temperate wet climate. Application of fungicides and good horticultural practices do not prevent canker damage in nurseries and orchards. Disease outbreaks damage and even completely destroy trees. To date, complete resistance to N. ditissima is not known in apple, but cultivars differ considerably in their level of partial resistance. To be able to conduct breeding for resistance to <b>European</b> <b>canker,</b> reliable plant tests are urgently needed. Differences in resistance to N. ditissima (colonization rate; CR) in apple cultivars were evaluated by wound inoculations with a standardized number of conidia on cut shoots from mature trees placed in a climate chamber and on potted trees in an unheated greenhouse. Infection percentage (Inf%) was assessed by 'natural' inoculations in leaf scars under high infection pressure in the field. All the experiments were carried out over 2 years. Lengths of lesions were measured at regular time intervals on five occasions for shoots and seven occasions for trees. Considerable differences in CR and Inf% were found among the cultivars. The relative levels of resistance obtained are consistent with previous reports for most cultivars. Assessment of CR (area under curve) and Inf% thus proved to be useful tools for evaluation of resistance to <b>European</b> <b>canker.</b> Also, some potentially new sources of resistance were identified. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Carbendazim {{can be used}} by New Zealand pipfruit growers {{for control}} of <b>European</b> <b>canker,</b> caused by Neonectria ditissima. A total of 162 N. ditissima {{isolates}} were tested for carbendazim sensitivity using a mycelial growth assay on amended malt extract agar plates at concentrations from 0 - 2 mg/litre. Generally, isolates ceased growth at 2 mg/ litre carbendazim, with 65 isolates ceasing growth at 1 mg/litre. The EC 50 values calculated for 19 isolates ranged from 0. 51 to 1. 38 mg/litre. The data suggested that isolates ranged from sensitive (EC 50 100 mg/litre. The isolates tested were mostly sensitive to carbendazim, but some showed a shift towards intermediate resistance. Mycelial growth tests at 2 mg/litre may be a useful tool to screen single spore isolates quickly for potential carbendazim resistance...|$|E
40|$|<b>European</b> {{fruit tree}} <b>canker,</b> caused by Nectria galligena, {{is a major}} disease in organic apple cultivation. No copper {{can be used in}} Denmark and the Netherlands to control the disease. Removal of cankers is the only {{remaining}} method to control the disease. Slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) was applied at 50 or 100 kg/ha three times during the leaf fall period to protect apple trees against the disease. Experiments under high inoculum pressure showed a reduction in newly formed cankers of 57, 35 and 60 % with respect to untreated for 3 years respectively. The chemical standard thiophanate-methyl further reduced the number of newly formed cankers by 99, 60 and 89 % with respect to untreated for these 3 years respectively in these experiments. These results showed that slaked lime was less efficacious than the chemical standard under these high inoculum pressure circumstances. Demonstration experiments showed an efficacy of 70 and 68 % for slaked lime and 62 and 62 % for the conventional standard (carbendazim and captan) with respect to untreated controls in 2 years respectively. The demonstration experiments, done in commercial orchards and under normal inoculum pressure, showed a similar efficacy as the conventional standard. It is concluded that the use of slaked lime to control <b>European</b> fruit tree <b>canker</b> can contribute to a more economic organic apple and pear production in temperate climate zones...|$|R
40|$|<b>European</b> {{fruit tree}} <b>canker,</b> caused by Neonectria ditissima, is an {{important}} disease of pome fruit worldwide. Apple cultivars differ in their levels of susceptibility to N. ditissima. In order to design an effective plant resistance test, we examined the effectiveness of two resistance parameters: infection frequency and lesion growth. Both parameters were evaluated in parallel tests using 10 apple cultivars in three experimental years, applying seminatural infection of leaf scars (infection frequency) or inoculation of artificial wounds (lesion growth). We compared six parameters for lesion growth, of which a new parameter, lesion growth rate (LGR), {{appeared to be the}} best with respect to reproducibility and statistical significance. LGR is defined as the slope of the regression of lesion size versus time. The slope was estimated for each lesion, employing a common start date and a lesion-specific end date determined by the girdling of the lesion. The two parameters (infection frequency and LGR) were examined in separate experiments and in three successive years, and provided complementary information and resulted in reproducible conclusions on the relative resistance levels to N. ditissima of the tested cultivars. The presented methods can be used to develop strategies for the control of <b>European</b> fruit tree <b>canker</b> (e. g., in the breeding of new apple cultivars with high levels of resistance to N. ditissima) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>European</b> apple <b>canker</b> (EC) {{is caused}} by Neonectria ditissima, a {{pathogen}} officially registered as a quarantine pest in 2012. Thirty-five isolates of N. ditissima of different geographical regions of southern Brazil from apple branches showing symptoms of EC were identified by the specific pair primers Ch 1 and Ch 2 and analyzed concerning the virulence on Gala apple cultivar and morphophysiological characteristics. The disease symptoms were characterized and the isolates compared based on average mycelium growth (AMG), mycelium growth index (MGI), colony color, conidia type, dimensions and growth on potato dextrose agar (PDA), malt agar (AM), and synthetic SNAY (SN) culture media. Nineteen isolates showed the greatest AMG on PDA, forming three growth groups of 35. 56 (GI), 52. 71 (GII), and 62. 67 mm (GIII). Seven isolates showed MGI greater than 4. 0 mm diameter on PDA compared with that on AM and SN. The highest conidia production was on SN, and the predominant colony color in all media was white to beige with central pigmentation of brown and borders colored in shades of beige. There were significant differences among the average dimensions of micro- and macroconidia on PDA, AM, and SN. The pathogenicity was confirmed for all isolates despite of different morphophysiological characteristics. There was no correlation among isolates morphophysiological variability, virulence, and geographical origin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Autumn leaf scars are an {{important}} pathogen infection site for <b>European</b> <b>canker</b> on apples. Trials were undertaken to evaluate the effects of adjuvants on spray coverage of new leaf scars, and determine if adjuvants could (1) impart any significant rainfastness to protectant captan sprays and (2) provide any redistribution of captan during a rain event post-leaf drop. Retention on fresh leaf scars was increased {{with the use of}} organosilicone-latex sticker adjuvants only. Rain had little effect on spray residues but these adjuvants could improve rainfastness of captan due to their effects on spray retention. Retention on stem wood and around leaf nodes was increased by up to seven-fold with the use of superspreader-type adjuvants, due to redistribution of spray runoff from leaves. High initial deposits resulted in post-rain residues on leaf scars three-fold higher than a captan spray alone. Redistribution of captan onto exposed leaf scars in rain appears likely with these adjuvants...|$|E
40|$|Fruit {{pathogens}} {{are currently}} {{one of the}} main factors involved in quarantine-related market access. Unconfirmed South African records pertaining to the presence of the causative agent of <b>European</b> <b>canker</b> of apples, Neonectria ditissima, have been the cause of many disputes regarding its status as a quarantine pest in this country. To clarify this issue, the identity of fungal isolates that were presumed to be N. ditissima, were verified by making use of species-specific PCR primers designed for N. ditissima. The isolates were obtained from symptomatic apple trees in the major apple-producing areas in South Africa. These data were supplemented by a morphological reexamination of all six previous herbarium specimens presumed to be N. ditissima. The results revealed that none of the samples tested positive for N. ditissima, nor were any of the six herbarium specimens representative of Neonectria species. This study represents the first attempt to resolve the status of N. ditissima in South Africa by means of a molecular approach, and our findings support the current regulated status of N. ditissima in South Africa.

40|$|<b>European</b> <b>canker,</b> {{caused by}} the fungus Neonectria ditissima, is a severe problem in apple {{production}} both in Sweden and in many other northern European countries. Even when applying fungicides and good horticultural practices, canker damage occurs almost yearly in nurseries and orchards. Some years, devastating outbreaks destroy numerous trees. To date, complete resistance to N. ditissima is not known in apple. For further research and plant breeding, heritable variation in quantitative resistance should be investigated by phenotyping large sets of cultivars. In the present project, 55 apple cultivars were screened for resistance to N. ditissima. One-year-old shoots from mature trees were inoculated in the greenhouse with a standardized volume and concentration of conidia suspension using different inoculation methods. Two-year-old trees of five cultivars were inoculated in the field. Length of the occurring cankers was measured at regular intervals throughout a period of up to three months. The investigated cultivars showed considerable differences in colonization rate. In cultivars known to be highly resistant, i. e., âSantanaâ, lesions progressed much slower compared to susceptible cultivars like âCoxâs Orange Pippinâ and âJames Grieveâ. Since the inoculation-based phenotyping is demanding in labour and time (duration), especially when the test is performed on grafted trees, qPCR-based assessment of fungal biomass at early stages of infection was explored as an alternative or complementary approach for phenotyping...|$|E
40|$|Fruit tree canker {{caused by}} Neonectria ditissima {{is a serious}} problem in apple-producing regions with {{moderate}} temperatures and high rainfall throughout the year; especially in northwestern Europe, Chile, and New Zealand. Control measures are applied to protect primary infection sites, mainly leaf scars, from invasion by external inoculum. However, latent infections may occur when young apple trees are infected symptomlessly during propagation. This study aimed to develop a method for detection of latent fruit tree canker infections. Inoculations with conidiospore suspensions of N. ditissima were carried out in tree nurseries on the main stems of two-year-old trees of three apple cultivars and one pear cultivar. The inoculations were carried out during the natural abscission period in the autumn. No visible lesion or canker formations were present at the time when the inoculated trees were uprooted. It appeared that the infections may remain latent during the period from infection to uprooting (2 months) and during the subsequent 4 months of cold storage of the trees. Nevertheless, symptoms were generally induced within 8 weeks after transfer of infecting planting material from the nursery field into a climate chamber with high temperature and high relative humidity. The methodology presented is developed to detect latent infections of N. ditissima in nursery trees, prior to planting in the orchards, and it may contribute in reducing the problem with <b>European</b> fruit tree <b>canker</b> in commercial production...|$|R
40|$|The {{apple canker}} disease (aka <b>European</b> <b>canker),</b> {{which is caused}} by the fungus Neonectria distissima, infects apple trees and can cause severe damage on both the fruit and the tree itself. For some time it has been assumed that apple trees may be {{infected}} as early as the planting stage. There is, however, no previous documentation on rootstock infection. If rootstocks can get infected, how does this happens and what is the entry point for the infection? This project has investigated the issue by means of testing different kinds of rootstocks and different methods of inoculation. The different methods used were inoculation by pricking the rootstock with needles containing inoculum, spraying the rootstocks with a spore suspension and dripping spore suspension in the wound made after cutting off the top shoot of the rootstock. Inoculation occurred at different dates, and the rootstocks received different treatments of pinching and topping. The experiments showed that all rootstocks may become infected by apple canker, although there was a difference in how effective the different methods of inoculation were. The rootstocks which were inoculated by needles containing inoculum had a high probability of developing infections and showed symptoms of infection after four weeks. Needles with inoculum inserted into the shoots provoked earlier symptoms than those inserted into the stem. Inoculation by spraying the rootstocks with a spore suspension developed very little infection, and did not show symptoms until eleven weeks after inoculation. Results also showed that, the rootstocks were most prone to develop infections if they were pinched the same day as they were sprayed with spore suspension. Rootstocks pinched one or three days before being sprayed with spore suspension developed fewer infections. All rootstocks tested, M 9, B 9, M 26 and MM 106, developed infections of apple canker, and {{there was no difference in}} susceptibility. When wounds were made in the rootstock, either by pricking with a needle or by cutting the top off, the infection levels after inoculation were high. If the wounds were made by pinching off the shoots, however, the probability of infection was low. Wounds in younger tissue were more susceptible for infection than wounds in older tissue. The results show that to reduce the risk of infection of apple canker, it is important to be considerate while handling rootstocks to avoid damages. When pinching, topping and grafting one should take precautions to avoid apple canker and be aware of potential sources of inoculum in the near vicinity. M-P...|$|E
