40|$|This paper {{provides}} step-by-step {{illustrations of}} the practical methods of computer-aided flat pattern development (CAFPAD) for bend <b>formable</b> <b>sheet</b> metal component (SMC) manufacture. Based on these methods, software systems are exclusively designed and developed for fully automated loft generation. The shape {{and complexity of the}} SMC geometry influence the choice among these methods comprising of contour augmentation, unfold, cross-section development as well as normal cross-section development techniques. Computer-integrated manufacturing activity for production of over 1000 aircraft SMCs that followed is utilized for constant improvization through continuous testing and validation. Efficient exploitation of special features such as symmetry and multiple bends have {{become an integral part of}} the methods included herein, which paved way for the creation of systems extending their scope beyond bend-formable SMCs. An assessment and the suitability of these practical methods vis-a-vis present-day SMC CAD/CAM solutions is also included...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Thermoforming of {{advanced}} thermoplastic composite sheets offers several advantages over traditional processing of these materials, such as tape laying However, some important processing issues {{have to be}} resolved before this can become a viable economical process. These include fiber placement control, low cycle times for molding and wrinkle-free complex shape forming. Some {{of the work that}} has been reported in the literature so far is reviewed. The major processing considerations that {{have to be dealt with}} in going from the design to the thermoforming of a part are discussed. In particular, emphasis is placed on the different processing techniques such as matched-metal forming, hydroforming and diaphragm forming (superplastic aluminum and polymeric) and on material forms such as woven fabrics, angle-plied unidirectional tapes and the newly developed ordered staple <b>formable</b> <b>sheet</b> based on aligned discontinuous fibers. The forming of several shapes using these techniques is presented to illustrate the potential {{of advanced}} composite thermoforming and possible limitations. Some rules of thumb are also offered to reduce the trial-and-error approach currently faced by persons new to the field. 1...|$|E
40|$|Lightweight {{solutions}} and functional integration {{become more and}} more important in different fields of industry. In order to achieve a sensor and actuator functionality of shaped sheet metal parts, today a generally manual application step of the piezomodule is necessary. This subsequent process is time consuming and leads to high costs. In earlier studies a method was presented allowing the fabrication of a formable compound with an integrated sensor and actuator functionality [1, 2]. The formability of the compound is achieved using a viscous adhesive, surrounding the piezomodule during the forming operation. The low viscosity of the adhesive allows a relative movement between the piezomodule and the sheet metals and drastically reduces the transfer of critical strains to the piezomodule. Curing of adhesive takes place after the forming operation. To improve the efficiency of the process chain an advanced adhesive system with robust application properties has to be used. Furthermore, the productivity of several fabrication steps and their sequence in the process chain have to be verified and improved. The paper presents the process chain designed for automated production of <b>formable</b> sandwich <b>sheets</b> with integrated piezomodules, including the production steps for the fabrication of the semi-finished part as well as the forming operation. Aiming on a good formability during the shaping operation and on a stiff connection between the piezomodule and the sheet metal in the finished sandwich part, one focus is set on the adhesive properties required during the different process steps...|$|R
40|$|Steel {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the primary materials in use today, however, even after 200 years of published research, innovative methods are being discovered and exploited to produce steel with enhanced properties. One such recent discovery has been termed Quenching and Partitioning (Q&P). The Q&P heat treatment process is reported to produce a multiphase microstructure consisting of retained austenite stabilised to room temperature, and a harder martensitic phase. This combination is prospected to form a new generation of high strength, <b>formable</b> <b>sheet</b> steel well suited to the demands of the automotive industry. Previous research has reported on the application of Q&P to commercial grades of steel, however, the temperatures required have hampered study of the process. In this investigation a model alloy has enabled separation of Q&P into its individual stages for closer inspection. Standard metallographic techniques were used to examine the microstructure of the material, followed by X-ray diffraction measurements to determine the stability of the austenite phase fraction before and after partitioning, confirming the effectiveness of the partitioning process in stabilising retained austenite. Estimations of carbon concentration via lattice parameter measurements have provided evidence of austenite carbon enrichment, but also suggest that some carbon remains unaccounted for, possibly as an equilibrium distribution between epsilon carbides and strained interstitial sites. In-situ partititioning in a neutron diffractometer has been utilised to obtain real-time measurements of the partitioning process. These measurements suggest that redistribution of carbon within martensite occurs before partitioning to austenite becomes kinetically significant. The trapping of carbon within energetically favourable locations is postulated to be a major factor in retarding carbon migration from martensite to austenite when compared to mathematical models of the partitioning process. Neutron diffraction measurements of carbon interstitial occupancy in austenite have also provided further evidence of austenite carbon enrichment during the partitioning process.
