40|$|Vitamins may be {{required}} in minute amounts by the body, but they are undeniably necessary for normal metabolic and physiological processes. The discovery of vitamins and an improved understanding of their functions {{are among the most}} important achievements of this century. Most vitamin deficiency diseases are rarely seen today <b>except</b> <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> What exactly are vitamins? The nature of vitamins is as varied as any group of nutrients. In general, vitamins are organic compounds which cannot be produced in adequate quantities in the body and must be obtained from food or the environment. More specifically, vitamins serve the similar purpose of maintaining normal body function. Vitamins are necessary for optimal growth, health, feed conversion and reproduction. To further complicate this, vitamins are also necessary for proper physical performance in horses. The target tissues of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K are skin, bones, muscles and blood. B vitamins serve as catalysts in the conversion of nutrients to tissues and the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates and protein to the final oxidation end products of CO 2 and H 2 O (via the citrat...|$|E

40|$|Widespread {{coral reef}} decline has {{included}} {{the decline of}} reef fish populations, and the subsistence and artisanal fisheries that depend on them. Overfishing and destructive fishing {{have been identified as}} the greatest local threats to coral reefs, but the greatest future threats are acidification and increases in mass coral bleaching caused by global warming. Some reefs have shifted from dominance by corals to macroalgae, in what are called “phase shifts”. Depletion of herbivores including fishes has been identified as a contributor to such phase shifts, though nutrients are also involved in complex interactions with herbivory and competition. The depletion of herbivorous fishes implies a reduction of the resilience of coral reefs to the looming threat of mass coral mortality from bleaching, since mass coral deaths are likely to be followed by mass macroalgal blooms on the newly exposed dead substrates. Conventional stock assessment of each fish species would be the preferred option for understanding the status of the reef fishes, but this is far too expensive to be practical because of the high diversity of the fishery and poverty where most reefs are located. In addition, stock assessment models and fisheries in general assume density dependent populations, but a key prediction that stocks recover from fishing is not always confirmed. Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) has far too many weaknesses to be a useful method. The ratio of catch to stock and the proportion of catch that is mature depend on fish catch data, and are heavily biased toward stocks that are in good condition and incapable of finding species that are in the worst condition. Near-pristine reefs give us a reality check about just how much we have lost. Common fisheries management tools that control effort or catch are often prohibitively difficult to enforce for most coral reefs <b>except</b> <b>in</b> <b>developed</b> <b>countries.</b> Ecosystem-based management requires management of impacts of fishing on the ecosystem, but also vice versa. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been a favorite management tool, since they require little information. MPAs are excellent conservation and precautionary tools, but address only fishing threats, and may be modest fisheries management tools, which are often chosen because they appear to be the only feasible alternative. “Dataless management” is based on qualitative information from traditional ecological knowledge and/or science, is sufficient for successful reef fisheries management, and is very inexpensive and practical, but requires either customary marine tenure or strong governmental leadership. Customary marine tenure has high social acceptance and compliance and may work fairly well for fisheries management and conservation where it is still strong...|$|R
40|$|Summary. -Breast-cancer {{incidence}} and mortality rates {{in different countries}} {{were found to be}} correlated with height, weight and age at menarche, all of which have been identified as risk factors in cohort or case-control studies of breast cancer. There were, however, correlations with total fat and animal protein consumption per capita even after controlling for the 3 anthropometric variables. This suggests that, while some of the effects of diet on breast-cancer rates may be mediated through effects on these known risk factors, there may be more direct effects as well. INCIDENCE and mortality rates for breast cancer show a marked geographic variation, being higher <b>in</b> industrialized nations (<b>except</b> Japan) than <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> Past attempts to explain this variation in rates have focused on differences in food consumption per capita and have shown the rates to be highly correlated with animal product and fat intake (Lea, 1966 : Carroll et al., 1968...|$|R

40|$|Year-to-year economy-wide {{measures}} of income distribution, {{such as the}} Gini coefficient, are rarely available for long periods <b>except</b> <b>in</b> a few <b>developed</b> <b>countries,</b> {{and as a result}} few analyses of year-to-year changes in inequality exist. But wage and earnings data by industrial sectors are readily available for many countries over long time frames. This paper proposes the application of the between-group component of the Theil index to data on wages, earnings, and employment by industrial classification in order to measure the evolution of wage or earnings inequality through time. We provide formal criteria under which such a between-group Theil statistic can reasonably be assumed to give results that also track the (unobserved) evolution of inequality within industries. While the evolution of inequality in manufacturing earnings cannot be taken as per se indicating the larger movements of inequality in household incomes, including those outside the manufacturing sector, we argue on theoretical grounds that the two will rarely move in opposite directions. We conclude with an empirical application to the case of Brazil, an important <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> for which economy-wide Gini coefficients are scarce, but for which a between-industries Theil statistic may be computed on a monthly basis as far back as 1976. ...|$|R
