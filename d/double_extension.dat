40|$|International audienceA {{statistical}} analysis is conducted on sequential (10 - 12) -(10 - 12) <b>double</b> <b>extension</b> twinning in a Mg AZ 31 alloy obtained after two mutually perpendicular successive compressions. Indeed, primary twins form {{during the first}} compression, which produce secondary twins during the second compression. Here, ``sequential double twinning'' is adopted to describe this twinning mechanism, which is different from classic double twinning obtained during monotonic loading. <b>Double</b> <b>extension</b> twins, no matter sequential or classic ones, can be classified into Groups I-IV according to their misorientations {{with respect to the}} parent grain. In the present study, the majority of the sequential <b>double</b> <b>extension</b> twins have relatively high Schmid factors (SFs) and a misorientation of 60 degrees with respect to the parent grain (Group III). However, the classical SF based analysis fails to explain why secondary twin variants in Group III are preferred over their nearest orientated neighbors in Group IV, since their SF differences are negligible. Therefore, a static double inclusion model is developed to analytically compute the elastic energy in a final configuration of sequential double twinning. The model well explains the predominance of secondary twins in Group III by a noticeable greater decrease of free energy after secondary twinning...|$|E

The notion of the generalized <b>double</b> <b>extension</b> of quadratic Lie superalgebras proposed by I. Bajo, S. Benayadi and M.  Bordemann [I. Bajo, S.

In particular, we will improve some results of [S. Benayadi, Quadratic Lie superalgebras with the completely reducible action of the even part on the odd part, J. Algebra 223 (2000) 344 – 366], in the sense that we will not demand that the action of the even part on the odd part is completely reducible, which naturally makes the proofs of our results more difficult...|$|E

This deficit may be due to a lesser reliance on the non-dominant limb. The contractions of multiple lower body muscle groups enhanced the activation of the dominant quadriceps. Greater levels of activation may be necessary to cope with the stabilization necessary for bilateral and multi-articular contractions...|$|R
