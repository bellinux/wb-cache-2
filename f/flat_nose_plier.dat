60|$|Among the {{newcomers}} was <b>Flat</b> <b>Nose,</b> the rascal who had aided Jean Bevoir and Jacques Valette {{to make the}} raid on the Morris pack-train. <b>Flat</b> <b>Nose</b> listened with interest {{to all the other}} red men had to tell him, and looked at Dave when the young pioneer was eating his dinner. Then <b>Flat</b> <b>Nose</b> left the camp in a hurry, stating that he would be back the next day.|$|R

60|$|While he was meditating, Jean Bevoir, <b>Flat</b> <b>Nose,</b> {{and several}} Indians of the Wanderers' tribe came up. The young pioneer was {{immediately}} surrounded, and <b>Flat</b> <b>Nose</b> caught {{him around the}} breast from the rear, pinning his arms to his side. The hunting knife was taken from him, and he realized at once that further resistance would be useless.|$|R

40|$|As {{a part of}} {{the program}} to study high sinking rate shapes, a series of drag tests was run in the High Speed Water Tunnel. Since <b>flat</b> <b>noses</b> are used to {{facilitate}} water entry, a preliminary investigation was made of the drag of <b>flat</b> <b>nosed</b> bodies of varying bluntness. The study as planned will later include streamline shapes. Drag measurements were also obtained for the 6 -in. Projector Charge Ex. l and the 5 -in. A. S. Projectile Ex. 30...|$|R

60|$|As Dave {{was rising}} a form {{appeared}} before him, and {{an instant later}} he was confronted by <b>Flat</b> <b>Nose.</b> The Indian came forward before the young pioneer could think of withdrawing.|$|R

50|$|Electrical {{power was}} {{supplied}} by duplicated ram-air turbines located behind the twin air intakes in the <b>flat</b> <b>nose.</b> The earlier Blue Danube design had relied on lead-acid batteries which had {{proven to be}} both unreliable and to require time-consuming pre-flight warming.|$|R
60|$|But {{this was}} a mistake. Jean Bevoir and <b>Flat</b> <b>Nose</b> had been eager for the fight, but word had come in {{at the last moment}} that the attack must be put off, and such was the power of Pontiac and other great chiefs of that {{vicinity}} that <b>Flat</b> <b>Nose</b> obeyed.
