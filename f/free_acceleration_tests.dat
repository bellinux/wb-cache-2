40|$|Particulate {{emissions}} cause {{adverse health}} effects {{and for this reason}} they are regulated since the 80 s. Vehicle regulations cover particulate emission measurements of a model before its sale, known as type approval or homologation. For heavy-duty engines the emissions are measured on an engine dynamometer with steady state points and transient cycles. For light-duty vehicles (i. e. the full power train) the particulate emissions are assessed on a chassis dynamometer. The measurement of particulate emissions is conducted either by diluting the whole exhaust in a dilution tunnel with constant volume sampling or by extracting a small proportional part of the exhaust gas and diluting it. Particulate emissions are measured by passing part of the diluted exhaust aerosol through a filter paper. The increase of the weight of the filter is used to calculate the particulate matter mass (PM) emissions. Vehicles are also checked during the course of their lives, i. e. those pulled over by authorities for roadside checks or the mandatory periodic inspection in a garage. In this case smoke is assessed with <b>free</b> <b>acceleration</b> <b>tests.</b> However, all these tests do not give any relevant information about the emissions of the vehicles during real driving conditions. This was only recently regulated. The particulate emissions on the road are measured with portable emission measurement systems (PEMS). The particulate emissions of newer vehicles decreased by more than two orders of magnitude since the 80 s. The particulate measurement methods reached their detection limit and for this reason the particle number (PN) concentration was introduced in the European Union legislation as a new metric. In this paper a short summary of the particulate emission legislation of vehicles over the years is given. Then the instrumentation that has been used and is currently being used, like gravimetric filter measurement, is explained. In addition, other popular methods and instruments are analyzed, like chemical analysis of filters, light extinction, scattering and absorption instruments, electrical mobility and particle counting instruments. Correlation of the different instruments is discussed for different vehicle emission levels. Predictions for future instruments for low emission vehicles are given. JRC.

40|$|A new {{parameters}} {{determination method}} for squirrel-cage induction motors is presented. As a main contribution, the method uses the instantaneous electrical {{power and the}} mechanical speed measured in a <b>free</b> <b>acceleration</b> <b>test</b> to estimate the double-cage model parameters. The parameters are estimated from the machine impedance calculated at several points. At speed points where the double-cage effect is significant, i. e., between the zero speed point and the maximum torque point, the machine impedance is evaluated by the instantaneous power method, and at speed points where the double-cage effect is not significant, i. e., between the maximum torque point and synchronism, the machine impedance is evaluated by a dynamic-model-based linear least-square method. The proposed method {{has been applied to}} obtain the parameters of three motors tested in the laboratory. To check the method accuracy, the steady-state torque and current-slip curves predicted by the estimated parameters are successfully compared with those measured in the laboratory.

40|$|Abstract—Theon {{road vehicle}} {{population}} in India {{is growing at}} an exponential rate. Hence the condition and roadworthiness of many on-road vehicles are highly unsatisfactory leading to higher exhaust emissions and road accidents. Pollution Under Control (PUC) is the existing system of periodic I&M in India which is a mandatory requirement for all categories of on-road vehicles including two wheelers. Under this system the PUC certificate is issued for a vehicle upon conformity to emissions based on idle test for Gasoline vehicles and <b>free</b> <b>acceleration</b> smoke <b>test</b> for diesel vehicle. This manual process may result in some hindrances. So we are thinking about automating the above mentioned process.

The captured image by the camera would be converted into text using optical character recognition. Further in our system we would be using a sensor to detect the amount of CO emitted by the vehicle. This value would be sent to the software whichwould save it along with the vehicle number. The entire software system would be developed in Mat la...|$|R

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model {{that could be}} useful for investigating the performance of ground vehicles using <b>acceleration</b> <b>tests</b> was developed. The model takes into account all of the forces acting on a moving vehicle to give a description of its kinematics: the rolling friction of the propulsion devices, their slip on the soil, aerodynamic resistance, road slope and traction developed by the engine.

For the accelerated vibration <b>test,</b> the <b>acceleration</b> <b>test</b> of {{six degrees of freedom}} (DOF) in the time domain using MAST and the <b>acceleration</b> <b>test</b> of single-DOF in the frequency domain using single axis equipment are performed.

The tests are performed by enveloping and amplifying PSD lines of real roads after analyzing frequencies. No failure is found in the six-DOF <b>acceleration</b> <b>tests.</b> However in single-DOF tests, the connection part between the battery and bracket had been broken.
