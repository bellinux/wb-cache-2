Recently, multi-agent simulations are getting more important in many fields such as planning of a large-scale disaster evacuation and military operations (Cil 2010, Nakajima 2008, Persons 2005). Since such simulations are characterized that they are composed of multi-ple of heterogeneous organizations, {{and the number of}} agents is very large, we have to provide an effec-tive and efficient simulation environment. We have focused on a decision making model of organizations in the real world (Kuramoto 2012), and have implemented FUSE in Java.

One dilemma surrounds how firms might engage in routinized, path dependent activities while simultaneously exploring new opportunities. Another question surrounds the strategic role required of key firm decision makers in bringing about differential performance. Using an in-depth case study (2007 to 2012) on the airline Spanair, we ask the following question: How can a firm leverage its resource base to bring about deep purposeful change? In our findings we identify a hierarchical framework with two first order dynamic capabilities, <b>goal</b> <b>directing</b> and renewing, and one second order capability, transforming. We contribute to the literature by demonstrating, how {{a link between the}} <b>goal</b> <b>directing</b> capability of senior directors and the transforming capability, create a strategic <b>goal</b> <b>directed</b> path used to guide and monitor performance.
