5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

2500|$|Netanyahu defines {{capitalism}} as [...] "the {{ability to}} have individual initiative and competition to produce goods and services with profit, but not to shut out somebody else from {{trying to do the}} same." [...] He says that his views developed while he was working as an economic consult for Boston Consulting Group: [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the Boston Consulting Group looked at governments and worked for governments. They wanted to do a strategic plan for the government of Sweden. I was on that case and looked at other governments. So I went around to other governments in Europe in 1976 and I was looking at Britain. I was looking at France. I was looking at other countries, and I could see that they were stymied by concentrations of power that prevented competition. And I thought, hmm, as bad as they are, ours was worse because we had very little room for private sector competition to the extent that we had government-controlled or union-controlled companies, and so you really didn't get the competition or the growth... And I said, well, if <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> a chance, I'll change that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anberlin lead vocalist Stephen Christian {{has stated}} {{different}} {{origins of the}} band's name in various interviews, prevalent among which was his claim that he had long intended to name his first daughter Anberlin. Struggling to find {{a name for the}} band, Stephen suggested it; [...] "We were all sitting around {{trying to come up with}} a name. None of us were married or had kids, but one day I was going to name my daughter Anberlin, so I figured we could name the band that until we thought of something better. So we chose Anberlin and no one has thought of anything better." [...] He stated he was no longer going to use Anberlin to name his first daughter, however he said, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> a daughter and name her Anberlin, she'll think she was named after the band instead of the other way around." [...] Christian had also stated in another interview that the band's name was created when he was thinking about cities in Europe he wanted to visit. In his mind he listed [...] "London, Paris, Rome, and Berlin." [...] Christian thought that [...] "and Berlin" [...] would be an appropriate name for a band, and so when the band was looking for a name Christian suggested [...] "And Berlin," [...] which was then modified to [...] "Anberlin." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 56, {{he married}} Li Shuxian, a {{hospital}} nurse, on 30 April 1962, in a ceremony held at the Banquet Hall of the Consultative Conference. From 1964 until his death he worked as an editor for the literary department of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, where his monthly salary was around 100 yuan. One yuan in the 1960s was equivalent to about 40 cents USD. Li recalled in a 1995 interview that: [...] "I found Pu Yi a honest man, a man who desperately needed my love {{and was ready to}} give me as much love as he could. When I was having even a slight case of flu, he was so worried I would die, that he refused to sleep at night and sat by my bedside until dawn so he could attend to my needs". Li also noted like everybody else who knew him that Puyi was an incredibly clumsy man, leading her to say: [...] "Once in a boiling rage at his clumsiness, I threatened to divorce him. On hearing this, he got down on his knees and, with tears in his eyes, he begged me to forgive him. I shall never forget what he said to me: 'I have nothing in this world except you, and you are my life. If you go, I will die'. But apart from him, what did <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> in the world?".|$|E
2500|$|In his {{analysis}} of Portal, Daniel Johnson points out that [...] "the larger chunk of Portals narrative exists in GLaDOS' dialogue", which tells [...] "a metaphoric tale of a power struggle of identity roles within an institution". He discusses how the [...] "backstage" [...] of the institution is hinted at and gradually revealed through GLaDOS's slip-ups, from the momentary glitch during her initial instructions to the player ("the first flaw in the routine") to her ultimate abandonment of the formal language of the institution as she desperately pleads with the player {{to return to the}} testing area (the [...] "front stage", where the institution's inner workings are supposedly hidden from view). Microsoft Game Studios developer Tom Abernathy, in discussing the importance of compelling characters in video games, praises Portal for giving its audience [...] "room to do some imagination work" [...] by inviting them to read between the lines to understand GLaDOS's motivations. His own interpretation is that GLaDOS is conflicted between her wants and needs, a conflict which ultimately [...] "causes her to go crazy". Stephen Totilo notes the [...] "artful way" [...] in which GLaDOS's antagonistic character is slowly revealed and defined throughout Portal despite [...] "little interactivity in how the story is told". [...] Of his own reaction to that character development, he writes, [...] "I wanted to hunt GLaDOS down, confront her for her lies, and break free of her clutches. I wanted this boss battle. I don't know if <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> wanted a boss battle before." [...] Newsweek editor N'Gai Croal describes her as a [...] "maternal, mischievous, malevolent and finally murderous unreliable narrator".|$|E
2500|$|At the {{previous}} race in Italy, {{the gap between}} Rosberg and Hamilton had closed by seven points. Hamilton had started from pole position ahead of Rosberg, but had a poor start off the line and fell to fourth. He retook the lead after Rosberg braked late and went straight on at the first turn and used the escape road to rejoin the track. Hamilton remained the lead {{for the rest of}} the race to win. With six races left in the season, Hamilton was aware he could not lose any further ground to Rosberg in the championship battle and was pleased to make an improvement after his Monza victory: [...] "Despite the highs and lows, I'm still well and truly in the hunt for the championship and that is something that gives me huge motivation for the final six races - starting in Singapore." [...] Rosberg admitted Hamilton's form and past experience in championship battles could possibly be advantageous but it was something the latter was not concerned over and would focus on himself: [...] "At the moment, I am enjoying the moment more than <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> in the sport because I get to a race and I have a car where I know I can be on pole and I can win," [...] Ricciardo stated that while he was aware his chances of winning the championship were not realistic, he would take a race-by-race approach, and hoped to win either of the season's next two races to draw closer in the title battle: [...] "All it takes is a couple of wins and a couple of bad races for the championship leader, and all of a sudden everything's possible again. So let's see what happens." ...|$|E
