25|$|One {{important}} issue related to <b>human</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> is safety, {{particularly for the}} gene therapy of non-fatal diseases such as OA. The main concern is the high immunogenicity of certain viral vectors. Retroviral vectors integrate into the chromosomes of the cells they infect. There will be always a chance of integrating into a tumor suppressor gene or an oncogene, leading to virulent transformation of the cell. In general, gene transfer to humans is considered as a safe therapeutic method, despite recent events that have provided examples of random adverse events.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} five thousand known genetic diseases, {{and the potential}} to treat these diseases using transgenic animals is, perhaps, {{one of the most}} promising applications of transgenes. There is a potential to use <b>human</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> to replace a mutated gene with an unmutated copy of a transgene in order to treat the genetic disorder. This can be done through the use of Cre-Lox or knockout. Moreover, genetic disorders are being studied through the use of transgenic mice, pigs, rabbits, and rats. More recently, scientists have also begun using transgenic goats to study genetic disorders related to fertility.|$|E

40|$|After over 20 {{years from}} the first {{application}} of <b>gene</b> transfer in <b>humans,</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> is now a mature discipline, which has progressively overcome several of the hurdles that prevented clinical success {{in the early stages}} of application. So far, the vast majority of <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> clinical trials have exploited viral vectors as very efficient nucleic acid delivery vehicles both in vivo and ex vivo. Here we summarize the current status of viral gene transfer for clinical applications, with special emphasis on the molecular properties of the major classes of viral vectors and the information so far obtained from <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> clinical trials...|$|R
25|$|Moreover, {{there is}} some {{research}} on <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> for animals with achromatopsia, with positive results on mice and young dogs, but less effectiveness on older dogs. However, no experiments have been made on humans. There are many challenges to conducting <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> on <b>humans.</b> See <b>Gene</b> <b>therapy</b> for color blindness for more details about it.|$|R
25|$|Despite a {{great deal}} of {{publicity}} and promises, the history of <b>human</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> has been characterized by relatively limited success. The effect of introducing a gene into cells often promotes only partial and/or transient relief from the symptoms of the disease being treated. Some gene therapy trial patients have suffered adverse consequences of the treatment itself, including deaths. In some cases, the adverse effects result from disruption of essential genes within the patient's genome by insertional inactivation. In others, viral vectors used for gene therapy have been contaminated with infectious virus. Nevertheless, gene therapy is still held to be a promising future area of medicine, and is an area where there is a significant level of research and development activity.|$|E
25|$|Wild-type AAV has {{attracted}} considerable interest from gene therapy researchers {{due to a}} number of features. Chief amongst these is the virus's apparent lack of pathogenicity. It can also infect non-dividing cells and has the ability to stably integrate into the host cell genome at a specific site (designated AAVS1) in the human chromosome 19. This feature makes it somewhat more predictable than retroviruses, which present the threat of a random insertion and of mutagenesis, which is sometimes followed by development of a cancer. The AAV genome integrates most frequently into the site mentioned, while random incorporations into the genome take place with a negligible frequency. Development of AAVs as gene therapy vectors, however, has eliminated this integrative capacity by removal of the rep and cap from the DNA of the vector. The desired gene together with a promoter to drive transcription of the gene is inserted between the inverted terminal repeats (ITR) that aid in concatemer formation in the nucleus after the single-stranded vector DNA is converted by host cell DNA polymerase complexes into double-stranded DNA. AAV-based gene therapy vectors form episomal concatemers in the host cell nucleus. In non-dividing cells, these concatemers remain intact {{for the life of the}} host cell. In dividing cells, AAV DNA is lost through cell division, since the episomal DNA is not replicated along with the host cell DNA. Random integration of AAV DNA into the host genome is detectable but occurs at very low frequency. AAVs also present very low immunogenicity, seemingly restricted to generation of neutralizing antibodies, while they induce no clearly defined cytotoxic response. This feature, along with the ability to infect quiescent cells present their dominance over adenoviruses as vectors for <b>human</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapy.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} replicate, viruses {{introduce}} their genetic material into the host cell, tricking the host's cellular machinery into {{using it as}} blueprints for viral proteins. Retroviruses go a stage further by having their genetic material copied into the genome of the host cell. [...] Scientists exploit this by substituting a virus's genetic material with therapeutic DNA. (The term 'DNA' may be an oversimplification, as some viruses contain RNA, and gene therapy could take this form as well.) A number of viruses {{have been used for}} <b>human</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapy,</b> including retroviruses, adenoviruses, herpes simplex, vaccinia, and adeno-associated virus. Like the genetic material (DNA or RNA) in viruses, therapeutic DNA can be designed to simply serve as a temporary blueprint that is degraded naturally or (at least theoretically) to enter the host's genome, becoming a permanent part of the host's DNA in infected cells.|$|E

40|$|Recombinant {{adeno-associated virus}} (rAAV) is an {{attractive}} tool for gene transfer and shows potential for use in <b>human</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapies.</b> The current methods for the production and purification of rAAV from the transfected cell lysate are mainly based on cesium chloride and iodixanol density ultracentrifugation, although those are not scalable. Meanwhile, chromatography-based systems are more scalable. Therefore, in this study, we developed a novel method for the production and purification of rAAV serotype 1 (rAAV 1) from serum-free culture supernatant based on ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography to obtain highly purified products with an ultracentrifugation-free technique towards Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) production. The purified rAAV 1 displayed three clear and sharp bands (VP 1, VP 2, and VP 3) following sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and more than 90 % of rAAV 1 particles contained fully packaged viral genomes according to negative-stain electron micrographic analysis. Consequently, the resultant genomic titer of the purified rAAV 1 was 3. 63 [*]×[*] 1013 v. g. /ml (the total titer was 4. 17 [*]×[*] 1013 v. g.) from the 4 [*]×[*] 109 HEK 293 cells.

40|$|Recombinant {{adeno-associated virus}} {{serotype}} 3 B (rAAV 3 B) can transduce cultured human liver cancer cells and primary human hepatocytes efficiently. Serine (S) - and threonine (T) -directed capsid modifications further augment its transduction efficiency. Systemically delivered capsid-optimized rAAV 3 B vectors can specifically target cancer cells {{in a human}} liver cancer xenograft model, suggesting their potential use for <b>human</b> liver-directed <b>gene</b> <b>therapy.</b> Here, we compared transduction efficiencies of AAV 3 B and AAV 8 vectors in cultured primary human hepatocytes and cancer cells {{as well as in}} human and mouse hepatocytes in a human liver xenograft NSG-PiZ mouse model. We also examined the safety and transduction efficacy of wild-type (WT) and capsid-optimized rAAV 3 B in the livers of nonhuman primates (NHPs). Intravenously delivered S 663 V+T 492 V (ST) -modified self-complementary (sc) AAV 3 B-EGFP vectors led to liver-targeted robust enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) expression in NHPs without apparent hepatotoxicity. Intravenous injections of both WT and ST-modified rAAV 3 B. ST-rhCG vectors also generated stable super-physiological levels of rhesus chorionic gonadotropin (rhCG) in NHPs.

40|$|Transfection methods. The first {{transfection}} procedures {{occurred in}} the early 1960 s and experiments with different cell types and tissues has now become widespread (Wolff & Lederberg, 1994). Different transfection methods have been employed (Mulligan, 1993) : a) The in vitro procedure when foreign genes are introduced into cultured cells or tissues. b) The in vivo method, when genes are directly introduced into the tissue (by injection, aerosol, etc); c) The ex-vivo system, in which cells are transfected in vitro and then introduced into a living organism; b and c) Have been the basis for <b>human</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapies</b> (Anderson, 1998). The foreign DNA can be used free or associated to different vectors (Mulligan). Vectors are molecules that become associated to DNA and facilitate its entrance into the host cytoplasm and nuclei. The most employed vectors are some viruses (retrovirus or adenovirus), some lipidic molecules and liposomes. On the other hand, DNA has been also employed as a free molecule (naked DNA).
