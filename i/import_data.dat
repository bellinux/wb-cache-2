40|$|Collecting {{the data}} {{required}} for quality prediction within a development team is time-consuming and expensive. It {{is tempting to}} make predictions using data that crosses from other projects or even other companies. The literature is contradictory {{on the value of}} effort estimates based on such cross data. We hypothesis that data irrelevancies are the root cause of unreliable cross effort estimation. To test that, this study takes three groupings of three projects, and trains effort estimators for project X using either local data (from within the same project) or <b>imported</b> <b>data</b> (that crosses from other projects or companies). This is repeated with and without relevancy filtering. Our results clearly show that without relevancy filtering, <b>imported</b> <b>data</b> performed significantly worse than using local data. However, with relevancy filtering, <b>imported</b> <b>data</b> performed no worse than local data. Therefore, we recommend the use of relevancy filtering whenever generating estimates using data from another project...|$|R
