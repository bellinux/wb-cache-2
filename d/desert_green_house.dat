40|$|ABSTRACT The major {{constraint}} of {{rice cultivation}} in the flood-prone {{area is the}} lack of tolerant varieties. A rapid screening method have to be developed under controlled environments, such as a <b>green</b> <b>house,</b> to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the selection under submergence condition. The aim of this research was to study the correlation beetween selection methods in greenhouse and in the field. This experiment was conducted at a <b>green</b> <b>house</b> of Muara Experimental Station, Bogor in 2011 / 2012. The experimental designs used were randomized complete design for greenhouse experiment and randomized complete block design for field experiment, with three replicates respectively. There were four sub-experiments in the greenhouse experiment, grouped based on seedling age (10 days and 35 days after seeding) and duration of submergence (10 days and 14 days). Those sub-experiments in the <b>green</b> <b>house</b> were compared with the experiment in the field. The results showed that there was strong correlation between recovery percentage in the <b>green</b> <b>house</b> and percentage recovery in the field.

40|$|The {{climate change}} policy {{is one of}} the key factors in the {{achievement}} of sustainable development in the Republic of Croatia. Control and mitigation of <b>green</b> <b>house</b> gases is correlated with all economy activities. Waste management {{is one of the}} main tasks of environmental protection in Croatia. The Waste Management Strategy of the Republic of Croatia and the Waste Management Plan in the Republic of Croatia define the concept of waste management hierarchy and direct and indirect measures as criteria for sustainable waste management establishment. The main constituent of this system is avoiding and minimizing waste, as well as increasing the recycling and recovery level of waste and land fill gas, which also represent <b>green</b> <b>house</b> gases mitigation measures. The Waste Management Plan consists of several direct and indirect measures for <b>green</b> <b>house</b> gases emission reduction and their implementation also affects the <b>green</b> <b>house</b> gases emissions. The contribution of the methane emission from land fills amounts to about 2 % of the total <b>green</b> <b>house</b> gases emissions in Croatia. The climate change control and mitigation measures as an integral part of waste management sector strategies represent the measures of achieving the national objectives to wards <b>green</b> <b>house</b> gases emission reduction which Croatia has accepted in the frame work of the Kyoto Protocol...|$|R

40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{estimating}} the technical efficiency of vegetable producing air-conditioned and non-air conditioned <b>green</b> <b>houses.</b> The study also aimed at examining {{the effect of}} the size of <b>green</b> <b>houses</b> on their technical efficiency within the KSA. The study relied on basic data collected from enquiry forms which were applied to stochastic sample of air conditioned and non-air conditioned <b>green</b> <b>houses.</b> Representing all regions of the KSA. The sample included 62 projects of non-air conditioned projects and 22 projects of air conditioned ones in the summer and autumn of 2007. the study made use of stochastic frontier functions of production according to actual hypotheses {{about how to deal with}} the stochastic errors. Based on standard estimates of the stochastic frontier function of the non-air conditioned <b>green</b> <b>houses</b> it appears that the increase in any of the <b>green</b> <b>houses</b> areas the number of employees or the variable costs of 10 %, leads to an increase in the producing of vegetable by a percentage of 9 %, 0. 7 % and 0. 2 % respectively. On the other hand, the increase in the fixed cost, by a percentage of 10 %, leads to a decrease in the vegetable producing by 0. 6 %. the estimated technical efficient by use of the stochastic frontier function for the non-air conditioned <b>green</b> <b>houses</b> ranged from a minimum of 0. 10 %, a maximum of 0. 97 % and an average of 0. 46 %. as for the air conditioned <b>green</b> <b>houses,</b> it appears that an increase in any of the fixed costs, the areas of the greenhouses and the variable costs by 10 %, leads to an increase of vegetable producing at percentages of 10. 6 %, 11. 1 % and 2. 9 % respectively. In addition, the estimated technical efficiency of the stochastic frontier function of air conditioned <b>green</b> <b>houses</b> ranged from a minimum of 0. 13 % a maximum of 0. 99 % and an average of 0. 59. The study recommended upgrading the administrative efficiency of the <b>green</b> <b>house</b> managers in order to increase producing vegetable of the air conditioned and non-air conditioned <b>green</b> <b>houses</b> by a percentage of 50. 4 % and 41. 4 respectively without any increase in the economic resources. Furthermore, the study recommended to expand the <b>green</b> <b>houses</b> projects for producing vegetables since they represent a developed technical approach to increase the producing of the vegetables in both quantity and quality, and helps to produce vegetables in other seasons. Accordingly the fluctuations in prices can be eliminated. In addition, <b>green</b> <b>houses</b> rationalize the consumption of water they save about 60 % of water used in open air agriculture.
