40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the European project PICASSO (Collaborative Project 234117, 7 th Framework), the radiographic simulator aRTist (analytical Radiographic Testing inspection simulation tool) [1] developed by BAM has been extended for reliability assessment of film and digital <b>industrial</b> <b>radiology.</b> NDT of safety relevant components in the aerospace industry requires proof on probability of detection (POD) for the inspection method. Simulation tools can reduce the expense of such extended, time consuming NDT trials by fitting the simulation results to the experiment. A concept has been developed as well as a software extension for reliability investigations, completed by a user interface for planning automatic simulations with varying parameters and defects. Furthermore, an automatic image analysis procedure is included to evaluate the defect visibility. The software tool is applied to a test case from the aeronautics industry [2, 3]. NDT trials of the RT inspection of simulated defects have been performed, and the results are compared t...|$|E

BAM has been working on modeling in the field of radiographic testing for many years. With the gathered theoretical background and the familiarity with practical requirements of industrial application the simulation software aRTist has been developed. This analytical simulator includes a description of the radiation source, the interaction of radiation with test pieces and flaws, and the detection process with special focus on film and digital <b>industrial</b> <b>radiology.</b> It features high processing speed with nearinteractive frame rates and a high level of realism. Here we focus on the recent developments of the simulator, notably the release of aRTist version 2.

40|$|This book {{presents}} concepts, {{methods and}} techniques to examine symptoms of faults and failures of structures, systems and components and to monitor functional performance and structural integrity. The book is organized in five parts. Part A introduces {{the scope and}} application of technical diagnostics and gives a comprehensive overview of the physics of failure. Part B presents all relevant methods and techniques for diagnostics and monitoring: from stress, strain, vibration analysis, nondestructive evaluation, thermography and <b>industrial</b> <b>radiology</b> to computed tomography and subsurface microstructural analysis. Part C cores the principles and concepts of technical failure analysis, illustrates case studies, and outlines machinery diagnostics {{with an emphasis on}} tribological systems. Part D describes the application of structural health monitoring and performance control to plants and the technical infrastructure, including buildings, bridges, pipelines, electric power stations, offshore wind structures, and railway systems. And finally, Part E is an excursion on diagnostics in arts and culture. The book integrates knowledge of basic sciences and engineering disciplines with contributions from research institutions, academe, and industry, written by internationally known experts from various parts of the world, including Europe, Canada, India, Japan, and USA...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: New digital {{detectors}} {{were developed}} for medical applications, {{which have the}} potential to substitute the X-ray film and revolutionise the radiological technique. Digital Detector Arrays (DDA: Flat Panel Detectors, Line Detectors) and Imaging Plates (Computed Radiography) allow a fast detection of radiographic images in a shorter time and with higher dynamic than film applications. Companies report about a reduction of exposure time down to 5 – 25 % in comparison to NDT film exposures. This provides together with the reduction of consumables economical (and also ecological) benefits and short amortisation periods. But this does not always provide the same image quality as NDT film. The requirements of the European and USA standards for film radiography are analysed to derive correct requirements for the digital image quality and procedures for prediction and measurement of image quality. Basically the USA standards seem to be more tolerant for these new innovative technologies. New standard proposals use signal/noise ratio and unsharpness as dominant parameters for image quality. Specialised measurement procedures are described. The properties of the new detectors can be controlled by electronics and exposure conditions. New names appear in literature like "direct radiography " and "film replacement techniques". The basic advantage of the new digital techniques is the possibility to use numeric procedures for image interpretation. <b>Industrial</b> <b>radiology</b> can be optimised for crack detection as well as for analysis of flaw depth and shape measurement. Automated flaw detection, measurement of part dimensions and detection o...|$|E
40|$|Detecting and localizing {{radiation}} {{is the very}} basis of physicists ’ work {{in a variety of}} fields, especially nuclear or subnuclear physics. Certain instruments have assumed special importance in the understand-ing of fundamental phenomena and have been milestones in the building up of modern theories. They make up a long list: the ionization chamber, the cloud chamber, Geiger-Müller counters, proportional counters, scintilla-tion counters, semiconductor detectors, nuclear emulsions, bubble cham-bers, spark and streamer chambers, multiwire and drift chambers, various calorimeters designed for total absorption and then measurement of parti-cle energy, Cherenkov or transition radiation counters designed to identify or select particles, and many other detectors, some very important examples of which are still being developed. However, some of this equipment has become obsolete as physicists ’ requirements have changed. Wire and drift-chambers, introduced in 1968, met the then requirements of physicists, whereas the properties of the most productive detectors available at the time, mainly bubble and spark chambers, were no longer capable of meet-ing those needs. Multiwire chambers gave rise to further developments in the art of detectors, of which some are highly innovative. Most high-energy physics experiments make use of these methods, but their application has extended to widely differing fields such as biology, medicine, and <b>industrial</b> <b>radiology.</b> Our study of multiwire proportional chambers, which began in 1967, was triggered by the problems with spark chambers which then faced us. The latter, introduced in 1959 by Fukui and Myamoto, beautifully supplement-ed the bubble chamber. Whereas the latter was still peerless in the quality of the information which it provided and from which one single exposure could on its own lead to an interesting discovery, the spark chamber gave a repetition rate more than 100 times higher. Moreover, as it had a memory of almost 1 µ s, the instrument could be triggered only for events selected by faster auxiliary counters, making it possible to address the study of phenom-ena which occurred much more rarely in very high-energy interactions. Nevertheless, the need to store the information on photographic films le...|$|E
