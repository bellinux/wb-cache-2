5000|$|Lever {{action is}} a type of firearm action which uses a lever located around the trigger <b>guard</b> <b>area</b> (often {{including}} the trigger guard itself) to load fresh cartridges into the chamber of the barrel when the lever is worked. This contrasts to bolt-action, semi-automatic, or selective-fire weapons. Most lever-action firearms are rifles, but some lever-action shotguns and a few pistols have also been made. One of the most famous lever-action firearms is the Winchester Model 1873 rifle, but many manufacturers—notably Marlin and Savage—also produce lever-action rifles. Even Colt's Mfg. Co. produced 1883 until 1885 6403 lever-action Colt-Burgess rifles. Mossberg produces the 464 in centerfire [...]30-30 and rimfire [...]22. While the term lever-action generally implies a repeating firearm, it is also sometimes —and incorrectly— applied to a variety of single-shot or falling-block actions that use a lever for cycling, such as the Martini-Henry or the Ruger No. 1.|$|E
50|$|That night, Arthur Square is {{plucked from}} his bedroom {{and taken to}} a strange, alien landscape. He {{encounters}} the insane, babbling King of Pointland, a being of zero dimensions. Then he encounters Lineland, a universe of one dimension that is populated by an arrogant line segment King who cannot imagine a new dimension that he cannot see. Finally, Arthur is whisked back to his living room. Suddenly he hears a voice booming out and sees a point grow to a circle {{and then back to}} a point. The being identifies himself as Spherius, a three-dimensional solid from Spaceland. After failed attempts to explain the third dimension, Arthur is popped into Spaceland and taken on a journey by Spherius. They stop at Area 33H and Arthur realizes that the symbols show a progression from point to line to square to cube, and that the constantly changing shape in the center is actually a cube, halfway though the plane of Flatland and spinning along all three axes. Hex was right! Arthur excitedly asks Spherius to show him the fourth dimension and the fifth dimension. Spherius laughs, saying there couldn't possibly be a higher dimension. He tells Arthur to spread the word of the third dimension and drops Arthur back into bed. Meanwhile, at the Ministry, Pantocyclus is ordering the triangle guards and circles, including Miss Helios, to beware any employees who mention the third dimension and to <b>guard</b> <b>Area</b> 33H.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe United States Coast <b>Guard</b> <b>area</b> and district commands are assigned platforms to accomplish required missions. As {{the nature and}} profile of the missions change over time, the platforms must be reallocated to better satisfy the new mission needs. The problem of reallocating existing platforms and, perhaps, acquiring new ones {{is referred to as}} the force structure problem. This problem is complex because of the multi-mission capability of the platforms, and the difficulty in quantifying projected mission requirements and platform suitability in meeting these requirements. In this thesis, methods for quantifying the mission requirements and platform suitability are proposed. Using these methods, a linear integer optimization model to allocate platforms is developed. Additionally, a FORTRAN based interface is implemented to facilitate the utilization of the model. Included in this interface are basic functions of a database system to aid the users in maintaining and updating model data. To demonstrate the use of the system, a realistic sample problem was extracted from Fiscal Year 1989 operational and administrative data. Outputs for the problem are given and analyzed [...] [URL] United States Coast Guar...|$|E

40|$|The disector is {{the only}} {{objective}} method for quantifying particles of variable size in a given volume. With this method, cell organelles are identified on adjacent sections, but only those present in one section are counted. When counting extremely rare structures in transmission electron microscope sections (physical disector), the usual procedure of counting on electron micrographs is limited for economic reasons (e. g. micrographs highly outnumbering the investigated structures). Hence, to apply this unbiased stereological method, a modification of the physical disector concerning 3 aspects has been developed. (1) The prerequisite of screening large corresponding tissue areas (here ∼ 65000 μm 2) was fulfilled by examining tissue areas {{along the edges of}} ultrathin sections. (2) The size of the counting frame was determined by measuring the lengths of the section margins (minus a <b>guard</b> <b>area)</b> by means of a Morphomat. This value was multiplied by the width of the investigated tissue zone, corresponding to the diameter of the electron microscope viewing screen. (3) Disector counting was carried out simultaneously on both sections (bidirectional disector) to improve efficiency. In the present study tiny synaptic bodies (SBs) were quantitated by disector in a rat pineal gland, yielding ∼ 30 SBs/ 1000 μm 3. By contrast, single section profile counts of SBs amounted to 90 SBs/ 20000 μm 2. Since the presently described adaptation of the disector is time-consuming, it is proposed to determine a proportion factor allowing to estimate number of structures per volume based on single section profile counts. This would decrease the evaluation time by more than 50 %...|$|E
