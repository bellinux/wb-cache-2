25|$|As Tayler (2003) mentions, <b>demutualisation</b> moves succeeded {{immediately}} {{because neither}} Conservative nor Labour party UK governments created a framework which put obstacles {{in the way}} of <b>demutualisation.</b> Political acquiescence in <b>demutualisation</b> was clearest {{in the case of the}} position on 'carpet baggers', that is those who joined societies by lodging minimum amounts of £100 or so in the hope of profiting from a distribution of surplus after <b>demutualisation.</b> The deregulating Building Societies Act 1986 contained an anti-carpet bagger provision in the form of a two-year rule. This prescribed a qualifying period of two years before savers could participate in a residual claim. But, before the 1989 Abbey National Building Society <b>demutualisation,</b> the courts found against the two-year rule after legal action brought by Abbey National itself to circumvent the intent of the legislators. After this the legislation did prevent a cash distribution to members of less than two years standing, but the same result was obtained by permitting the issue of 'free' shares in the acquiring plc, saleable for cash. The Thatcher Conservative government declined to introduce amending legislation to make good the defect in the 'two-year rule'.|$|E
25|$|The Building Societies (Funding) and Mutual Societies (Transfers) Act 2007, {{known as}} the Butterfill Act, was passed in 2007 giving {{building}} societies greater powers to merge with other companies.

25|$|Along {{with many}} other UK {{building}} societies in the 1990s, Northern Rock chose to demutualise as a building society and float on the stock exchange as a bank. Throughout this period a concern against <b>demutualisation</b> was that the assets of a mutual society were built up by its members throughout its history, not just by current members, and that <b>demutualisation</b> was a betrayal of the community that the societies were created to serve. Northern Rock chose to address these concerns by founding the Northern Rock Foundation, which funded community-based projects. At its Stock Exchange flotation Northern Rock distributed shares to members with savings accounts and mortgage loans; the flotation share price was £4.51908. It joined the stock exchange as a minor bank and {{was expected to be}} taken over by one of its larger rivals, but it remained independent.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of its <b>demutualisation</b> the country's main {{stockbrokers}} received shares in the €56m-valued exchange and dividing up €26m in excess cash. Davy Stockbrokers took the largest stake, at 37.5 per cent, followed by Goodbody Stockbrokers with 26.2 per cent; Investec with 18 per cent; RBS 6.3 per cent; Cantor Fizgerald 6 per cent; and Campbell O’Connor with 6 per cent.|$|E
25|$|The process {{began with}} the <b>demutualisation</b> of the Abbey National Building Society in 1989. Then, from 1995 to late 1999, eight {{societies}} demutualised accounting for two-thirds of building societies assets as at 1994. Five of these societies became joint stock banks (plc), one merged with another and the other four were taken over by plcs (in two cases after the mutual had previously converted to a plc).|$|E
25|$|The ASX (Australian Stock Exchange Limited) {{was formed}} in 1987 by {{legislation}} of the Australian Parliament which enabled the amalgamation of six independent stock exchanges that formerly operated in the state capital cities. After <b>demutualisation,</b> the ASX was the first exchange {{in the world to}} have its shares quoted on its own market. The ASX was listed on 14 October 1998. On 7 July 2006 the Australian Stock Exchange merged with SFE Corporation, holding company for the Sydney Futures Exchange.|$|E

25|$|In their heyday, {{there were}} {{hundreds}} of building societies: just about every town in the country had a building society named after that town. Over succeeding decades the number of societies has decreased, as various societies merged to form larger ones, often renaming in the process, and other societies opted for <b>demutualisation</b> followed by – in the great majority of cases – eventual takeover by a listed bank. Most of the existing larger building societies are the end result of the mergers of many smaller societies.|$|E
25|$|In the end, after {{a number}} of large demutualisations, and {{pressure}} from carpetbaggers moving from one building society to another to cream off the windfalls, most of the societies whose management wished to keep them mutual modified their rules of membership in the late 1990s. The method usually adopted were membership rules to ensure that anyone newly joining a society would, for the first few years, be unable to get any profit out of a <b>demutualisation.</b> With the chance of a quick profit removed, the wave of demutualisations came to an end in 2000.|$|E
25|$|All {{building}} {{societies in}} the UK {{are members of the}} Building Societies Association. At the start of 2008, there were 59 building {{societies in the}} UK, with total assets exceeding £360 billion. The number of societies in the UK fell by four during 2008 due to a series of mergers brought about, to a large extent, by the consequences of the financial crisis of 2007–2008. With three further mergers in each of 2009 and 2010, and a <b>demutualisation</b> and a merger in 2011, there are now 44 building societies.|$|E
40|$|Following privatisations in the 1980 's, the UK {{financial}} industry {{embarked on a}} series of <b>demutualisations,</b> which developed into a global trend in the late 1990 's. This structural shift has generated numerous debates in academic circles concerning various managerial issues of mutual versus stock owned companies. Informed by agency theory, this thesis contributes to this debate by exploring the link between ultimate organisational form and the behaviour of companies in the UK unit trust industry. The UK unit trust fund industry provides an excellent environment to explore this line of research because ultimate organisational form varies, and because the intra-industry variations are far smaller than those of other industries in term of regulations, income structure, and the use of information technology. For the purpose of analysis, the thesis compares unit trust management companies belonging to mutual and stock owned groups along three dimensions: (i) risk-taking and (ii) efficiency at the corporate level, and (iii) quality of their products, e. g. risk and fee adjusted performance of unit trusts that the companies offer. To this end, a number of quantitative analyses are undertaken, including Tobit regression and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), using data from a sample of 130 unit trust management companies for the financial year 1999 - 2000. The results support the agency theory hypothesis, revealing that at the corporate level, stock owned companies show higher managerial efficiency than the mutual counterparts whilst undertaking higher risk activities than the comparable mutual companies. Nonetheless, at the product level, no difference is found by ultimate ownership type with regard to risk-fee-adjusted performance of unit trusts. The latter indicates that competitive product markets remove the performance distinctions between mutuals and proprietary companies. Overall, these findings suggest that mutual organisations exhibit weaker cost control in conducting unit trust business via their affiliated companies.

2500|$|In {{its first}} meeting, the Co-operative Commission {{formally}} adopted {{the terms of}} reference set {{for it in the}} Movement leaders' original letter. These included aims to enable the Co-operative Movement to show that it could survive in the modern marketplace whilst still delivering on its social goals, and for the larger retail societies to help smaller co-operatives in other sectors to grow and thrive. Also included was the importance of ensuring that co-operatives could strongly resist any threat of <b>demutualisation</b> and prevent [...] "the liquidation of assets built up by prior generations of co-operators".|$|E
2500|$|The Co-operative Movement existed {{under the}} threat of <b>demutualisation,</b> whereby a society could {{be turned into a}} private company and its assets taken {{out of the hands of}} its members and under the control of private shareholders. The Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd (CWS) was {{particularly}} attractive to [...] "demutualisers" [...] because of the size of its assets, turnover and customer base, and in 1997 entrepreneur Andrew Regan began making an attempt to demutualise the CWS. He made a bid of £1.2bn for the co-operative, which was rejected by the members but led to two senior CWS executives being dismissed, and ultimately jailed for accepting a bribe for an unrelated transaction via a company that CWS sold to Regan. The bid had the benefit of shining a spotlight on the Movement's weaknesses, and it came to realise that its best long-term defence was to operate successful co-operative businesses: that they must succeed [...] "as , in terms of [...] performance – and as , meeting [...] social goals".|$|E
2500|$|... "The [...] {{directors}} of Northern Rock were the principal {{authors of the}} difficulties {{that the company has}} faced since August 2007. It is right that members of the Board of Northern Rock have been replaced, though haphazardly, since the company became dependent on liquidity support from the Bank of England. The high-risk, reckless business strategy of Northern Rock, with its reliance on short- and medium-term wholesale funding and an absence of sufficient insurance and a failure to arrange standby facility or cover that risk, meant that it was unable to cope with the liquidity pressures placed upon it by the freezing of international capital markets in August 2007. Given that the formulation of that strategy was a fundamental role of the Board of Northern Rock, overseen by some directors who had been there since its <b>demutualisation,</b> the failure of that strategy must also be attributed to the Board. The non-executive members of the Board, and in particular the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of the Risk Committee and the senior non-executive director, failed in the case of Northern Rock to ensure that it remained liquid as well as solvent, to provide against the risks that it was taking and to act as an effective restraining force on the strategy of the executive members." ...|$|E

50|$|At {{the same}} time <b>demutualisation</b> would address the {{perceived}} corporate governance issues that centred on the long-standing board conflict.
