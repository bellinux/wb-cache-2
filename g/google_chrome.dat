5|$|Microsoft Security Essentials is an {{antivirus}} software (AV) product that fights malicious software (malware), including computer viruses, spyware, Trojan horses and rootkits. It replaces Windows Live OneCare, a discontinued commercial subscription-based AV service, {{and the free}} Windows Defender, which until Windows 8 only protected users from adware and spyware. It automatically checks for and downloads the virus definitions it relies on from Microsoft Update, a web-based software service updated three times a day. Users may alternatively download the updates manually from the Microsoft Security Portal website. On 30 September 2011, a faulty definition update caused the product to incorrectly tag <b>Google</b> <b>Chrome</b> as malware. The issue was resolved within three hours. MSE originally ran on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7, although versions 4.5 and later do not run on Windows XP and Microsoft stopped producing definition updates for Windows XP on 14 July 2015.|$|E

40|$|We empirically {{assess whether}} browser {{security}} warnings are as ineffective {{as suggested by}} popular opinion and previous literature. We used Mozilla Firefox and <b>Google</b> <b>Chrome’s</b> in-browser telemetry to observe over 25 million warning impressions in situ. During our field study, users continued through a tenth of Mozilla Firefox’s malware and phishing warnings, a quarter of <b>Google</b> <b>Chrome’s</b> malware and phishing warnings, {{and a third of}} Mozilla Firefox’s SSL warnings. This demonstrates that security warnings can be effective in practice; security experts and system architects should not dismiss the goal of communicating security information to end users. We also find that user behavior varies across warnings. In contrast to the other warnings, users continued through 70. 2 % of <b>Google</b> <b>Chrome’s</b> SSL warnings. This indicates that the user experience of a warning can {{have a significant impact on}} user behavior. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for warning designers and researchers. ...|$|R
