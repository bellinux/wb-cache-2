To increase the spectral efficiency of the narrowband systems, identical carrier frequencies are reused in distant cells. The interference rejection capability of the receiver determines this frequency reuse and is therefore critical. In this thesis, we propose an improved demodulation scheme, employing high-resolution frequency estimation techniques, for continuous phase modulated (CPM) signals in presence of CCI. Minimum shift keying (MSK), which is a special case of CPM, is a very popular modulation format around the world. <b>Frequency</b> <b>detectors,</b> such as the limiterdiscriminator permit the non-coherent demodulation of MSK signals.

A wide range PLL could be used by different protocols and applications so that we maximize the reusability and reduce time to market. In this report we try to present an extended frequency CMOS monolithic VCO design. A negative feedback control algorithm is used to automatically adjust the VCO range according to control voltage. Based on this analog feedback control algorithm, the VCO achieves a wide range without any pre-register settings.

5000|$|A phase-frequency {{detector}} is an [...] sequential logic circuit originally made of four flip-flops (i.e., the {{phase-frequency detector}}s found {{in both the}} RCA CD4046 and the motorola MC4344 ICs introduced in the 1970s).

40|$|Photoacoustic tomography, also {{referred}} to as optoacoustic tomography, employs short laser pulses to generate ultrasonic waves in biological tissues. The reconstructed images can be characterized by the convolution of the structure of samples, the laser pulse and the impulse response of the ultrasonic transducer used for detection. Although the laser-induced ultrasonic waves cover a wide spectral range, a single transducer can receive only part of the spectrum because of its limited bandwidth. To systematically analyse this problem, we constructed a photoacoustic tomographic system that uses multiple ultrasonic transducers simultaneously, each at a different central frequency. The photoacoustic images associated with the different transducers were compared and analysed. The system was tested by imaging both mouse brains and phantom samples. The vascular vessels in the brain were revealed by all of the transducers, but the image resolutions differed.

Therefore, the proposed detector can utilize the channel frequency domain coherence to further decrease its computational complexity with a controlled performance loss. Moreover, a novel approach is proposed to calculate the frequency domain correlation matrix and matched filter.
