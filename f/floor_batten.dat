50|$|Batten has {{multiple}} meanings in construction and shipbuilding but is generally {{a strip of}} solid material, historically made from wood but can also be made from plastic, metal, or fiberglass. In a sense used in <b>flooring</b> a <b>batten</b> may be relatively large, up to 2.5 in thick by 7 in wide and more than 6 ft long.|$|R
50|$|The choir loft {{over the}} {{vestibule}} {{is supported by}} twin, canted, timber columns and is accessed via a small stair on the east side. The loft {{is open to the}} nave and has a tiered, timber <b>floor.</b> Timber <b>battens</b> line the rear wall which angles into the ceiling forming a shell-like space for the projection of sound into the nave. A fixed organ console stands near the front and its screened pipes are located {{at the rear of the}} loft. The loft contains timber pews and chairs.|$|R
40|$|The {{assigment}} of Bachelor`s work is {{the heating}} of kindergarten`s premises. The building is situated in the Central region in a village Běrunice. The kindergarten has 2 above – ground floors and 1 underground floor. The heating system of the building consists of double heating pipes. The horizontal distribution system is fitted above the <b>floor</b> in <b>battens.</b> The source of heat are two gass furnaces located in a technical room on the first floor. The furnaces serve {{as a source of}} the heat for the central heating system, heating of water and heating of ventilated air. The building is ventilated by ventilators...|$|R
5000|$|The wood shed {{was built}} about 1910. It {{is located on}} {{the western edge of the}} compound. It is an L-shaped structure. The {{building}} is 15 ft by 18 ft with a dirt <b>floor,</b> board and <b>batten</b> siding, and asymmetric gable covered with a galvanized metal roof. There are two separate doors on the east side and a third door on south side.|$|R
5000|$|... 1923 Both BDO and the Batten Co. {{moved to}} the Knapp {{building}} at 383 Madison Avenue. BDO leased an entire <b>floor,</b> while the <b>Batten</b> Co., with 246 employees, took a floor and a half. The 12-story building, designed by the architectural firm of Cross and Cross, was demolished in the late 1990s {{to make way for}} the 47-story Bear Stearns building (now JP Morgan Chase.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{hotel is}} a good {{regional}} example of a large timber interwar hotel that demonstrates the principal characteristics of its type. Built to provide comfortable accommodation for tourists, its original form and layout is legible and it retains many features including its lounge and coffee room (ballroom) space and evidence of its bars, parlours and retail facilities on the ground floor. On the first floor it retains: largely intact bedrooms, each with wash basin, opening off a central hall and onto wide verandahs; separate male and female bathroom facilities off the rear verandah; and a central guest lounge. Decorative features include ornamental plaster ceilings in the public ground <b>floor</b> spaces, <b>battened</b> sheet ceilings {{to the first floor}} rooms and generously sized timber joinery including built-in cabinets.|$|R
50|$|The {{symmetrical}} northern street facade has a verandah with a {{corrugated iron}} skillion awning supported by timber posts, with a timber <b>floor</b> and <b>batten</b> balustrade. The central entry has a timber framed door with glass panels, and {{is flanked by}} a sash window to either side. There is a single brick chimney stack on the eastern side, and the building has timber sash windows with arched headers. The laterite stone has been rendered and painted, but the southwest corner wall exhibits evidence of stone coursing and the rough pitted surface of the laterite stone. The walls display large bulges and variation and texture. A timber addition {{is attached to the}} rear of the building, and consists of a corrugated iron gabled roofed structure with another timber free standing structure to the south.|$|R
50|$|Each {{floor of}} the home's main section {{contains}} two large rooms while the rear ell has one large room on each floor. The ell's first floor room contains the kitchen. Many of the original details are still intact in the main section of the house such as the <b>flooring,</b> stairwell, and <b>batten</b> doors. The staircase features square balusters and a square newel. A dilapidated two-story kitchen and servants' house, possibly built in the 1930s or 1940s, is located behind the home.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} elevation has timber verandah posts {{supported on}} dark brick piers {{with an open}} balustrade supporting the oversized handrail to the ground floor and sliding multi-pane timber windows and fixed glazing {{to each of the}} upper <b>floor</b> bays. Timber <b>battens</b> line the understorey openings. The three storey rendered masonry addition built in the 1970s and attached by an enclosed walkway at the western end of the southern verandah has been detailed to match the existing building and houses a garage on the ground floor and bathrooms on the upper floors.|$|R
50|$|The {{basement}} plan {{is similar}} to the upper two floors. The space is more simply finished than the upstairs, though all of the walls are plastered and the spaces finished with simple woodwork. All but the southwest room have twentieth century wood <b>floors.</b> A <b>battened</b> door of beaded boards is located {{at the foot of the}} simple stair. A door at the south end of the hall leads to the area beneath the front porch. The opposite end of the hall has been enclosed and contains a modern kitchen. This area originally had iron bars on the window and a dirt floor. The original function of the northwest room is unknown. The northeast room is identically detailed and likely served as a dining room. The southeast room, which possesses an added bath in the corner, was used as a schoolroom. The southwest room still retains its brick floor, a large fireplace with cooking crane and a door leading to the basement of the hyphen. This room now contains the mechanical equipment for the house.|$|R
50|$|The next order {{placed with}} Newport Workshops was for wagons 113-127. These wagons were {{identical}} in design {{to the previous}} series; after 113 and 114, the wagons returned to the single roof and louvres type. About {{a year after the}} delivery of U 112, number 113 emerged from Newport Workshops on 19 March 1895. Wagons were constructed in intervals of a handful at a time, with gaps of months or years between deliveries, with the final wagon (U 125) emerging on 25 July 1895; deliveries were not in order of construction. Wagons 121 and 122 are noted in a 1904 rollingstock diagram as having <b>battened</b> <b>floors</b> for carrying fish.|$|R
5000|$|The {{construction}} of a chartaque was an operation that lasted several weeks. In 1706, {{during the time of}} the Kuruc wars, precise details are known about the fortifications of the Kuruc schanzen in eastern Styria. For one four-man chartaque, thus a relatively small one (there were also chartaques for up to 20 men), which was to be built in Goritz bei Radkersburg, about three kilometres north of the town of Radkersburg, the following was assessed to be needed: 20 workers (socagers from the surrounding villages), eight log posts each of three fathoms (ca. 18 feet long), 24 logs for beams and wall benches, 18 logs for the upper and lower <b>floors,</b> 25 <b>battens,</b> 75 wide boards, 400 batten nails, 1,000 shingle nails, 67 carts and, as for tradesmen, master carpenter: 18 man days and carpenter's apprentices: 54 man days. Such a chartaque came at a cost of 28 guilders and 24 kreuzer (plus the [...] "free" [...] socage). For two or three chartaques an overseer was appointed in addition to the crews of each chartaque. For the rebuilding of another chartaque which was burned down to its supporting posts, the cost was estimated at 30 guilders. There were also chartaques that were additionally protected by a small redoubt (redutierte Tschartaken), the redoubt costing an estimated 40 guilders. For larger chartaques for 12-15 men, 32 construction-quality logs (Stubenbäume), six rafter logs (Gesparrbäume), four complete trees for the posts, 75 standard boards and 1,500 batten nails were needed.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a typical}} hemp system, a [...] "line set" [...] {{consists}} of multiple hemp lines running from a batten above the stage {{up to the}} grid, through loft blocks to a headblock and then down to the fly floor where they are tied off in a group to a belaying pin on the pin rail. The lift lines and hand (operating) lines {{are one and the}} same. Typically, a lift line runs from the sand bag (counterweight) assigned to a specific line set, up to [...] "a single loft block" [...] above the fly floor and back down to the fly floor. A trim clamp (a.k.a. knuckle-buster) or a [...] "Sunday" [...] (a circle of wire rope) is used to attach this sandbag to the [...] "line set" [...] to balance the load placed on the batten. The sandbags are usually filled to weigh the same as the loads, making the two weights (the weight of the batten and the weight of the bag) equal. This arrangement assures greater safety. When the flyman wishes to fly a batten (scenery or lights) [...] "In" [...] (i.e., to the floor), the flyman pulls down on the lift line thereby raising the sandbag off the fly <b>floor</b> and the <b>batten</b> descends. When the flyman wishes to fly the batten [...] "Out", he pulls down on the line set (leaving it tied off) and the batten flies out as the sand bag descends to the flyfloor. This arrangement allows the flyman to control the speed of ascent and/or descent and provides greater safety for people on the stage below. The proper [...] "Out" [...] position for the batten is set when the sand bag reaches the fly floor in its descent (adjustable) and the proper [...] "In" [...] position for the batten is established when the line set (previously tied off to the pin rail) is fully extended (adjustable). This makes it unnecessary to [...] "spike" [...] or [...] "mark" [...] either the line set or the lift line. (An [...] "unbalanced working line set" [...] should never be allowed to exist over the stage.) ...|$|R
40|$|Aiming {{to measure}} the {{resistance}} of ewes against gastrintestinal nematodes, an experiment was conducted at Centro de Pesquisa do Arenito, of the Universidade Estadual de Maringá, located {{in the city of}} Cidade Gaúcha, northwest of Paraná. Ninety- four Santa Inês, 14 Bergamácia and 25 Texel ewes were used. The flock remained on Tanzânia (Panicum maximum cv. Jaq) pasture during the day, being withdrawn indoors, with suspended <b>battened</b> <b>floor,</b> during the night, when they were provided cassava bagasse. The ewes were monitored monthly and individually regarding the amount of endoparasites, through egg counting per gram of feces (EPG), and worms culture for identification of the species of those endoparasites. The Santa Inês ewes presented had lower (P ? 0, 05) susceptibility comparing to the breeds Texel and Bergamácia, being the averages of EPG 838, 58; 1240, 31 and 1821, 33 respectively. The highest percentage of endoparasites corresponded to the Haemonchus contortus, showing that this was the main type of endoparasites responsible for the EPG levels, followed by Trichostrongylus colubriformis. The counting of EPG of Santa Inês ewes showed a cubical behaviour over the year of observation, reaching the higher level in October, month in which the giving births happened. The Texel and Bergamácia ewes also showed cubical behaviour during the year, however, the higher EPG levels happened in the months of May, June and July. The Santa Inês ewes were the least prone to infection by endoparasites. Com o objetivo de verificar a susceptibilidade de ovelhas à infecção por nematóides gastrointestinais foi realizado experimento no Centro de Pesquisa do Arenito (UEM), no município de Cidade Gaúcha, noroeste do Paraná. Foram utilizadas 94 ovelhas Santa Inês, 14 Bergamácia e 25 Texel. Os rebanhos permaneceram em pastagem de Tanzânia (Panicum maximum cv. Jaq) no período diurno, sendo recolhidos em instalações cobertas, com piso ripado suspenso, no período noturno, onde foi fornecido resíduo de fécula de mandioca. As ovelhas foram monitoradas mensal e individualmente quanto à carga endoparasitária, por meio de contagem de ovos por grama de fezes (OPG), e realizada cultura de larvas para identificação das espécies de endoparasitos. As ovelhas Santa Inês apresentaram menor (P ? 0, 05) susceptibilidade comparada às raças Texel e Bergamácia, sendo as médias de OPG de 838, 58; 1240, 31 e 1821, 33, respectivamente. A maior porcentagem de endoparasitos correspondeu à espécie Haemonchus contortus, demonstrando que este parasito foi o principal responsável pelos valores encontrados de OPG, seguido por Trichostrongylus colubriformis. A contagem de OPG das ovelhas Santa Inês apresentou comportamento cúbico ao longo do ano de observação, atingindo pico máximo em outubro, mês em que se concentraram as parições. As ovelhas Texel e Bergamácia também apresentaram comportamento cúbico ao decorrer do ano, contudo, foram observadas maiores contagens de OPG nos meses de maio, junho e julho. As ovelhas Santa Inês foram menos susceptíveis à infecção por endoparasitos...|$|R
