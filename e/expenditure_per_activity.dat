40|$|SummaryBackgroundIt {{remains unclear}} how closely the {{physical}} inactivity observed {{in patients with}} Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) relates to the severity of their airflow limitation. Furthermore, it is unknown whether spirometric variables such as maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) and inspiratory capacity (IC) reflect the level of physical activity in daily life better than the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1), the main spirometric variable {{used to determine the}} severity of COPD. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the relationship between physical activity in daily life and the severity of COPD assessed by different spirometric variables: MVV, IC and FEV 1. MethodsForty patients with COPD (21 men; 68 ± 7 years; FEV 1 41 ± 14 % predicted) were performed spirometry and assessment of the physical activity level in daily life using an accelerometer (SenseWear® Armband). ResultsMVV was significantly correlated to total energy <b>expenditure</b> <b>per</b> day, energy <b>expenditure</b> <b>per</b> day in <b>activities</b> demanding more than 3 metabolic equivalents (METs), number of steps per day and time spent per day in moderate and vigorous activities (0. 42 ≤r≤ 0. 52; p< 0. 01 for all). Correlation of these variables with IC and especially FEV 1 was more modest, borderline or not statistically significant. There was no difference in time spent in vigorous activities among patients classified according to the FEV 1 -based GOLD stages II, III and IV, differently than that observed when patients were classified in groups according to their MVV. ConclusionIn COPD patients, MVV better reflects the physical activity level in daily life than FEV 1 and IC...|$|R

50|$|Our {{analysis}} {{indicates that}} the Current Urban Planning Assumptions are of virtually no value in predicting local government <b>expenditures</b> <b>per</b> capita.

This is after 50 years of unprecedented urban decentralization, which seems to be more than enough time to have developed the purported urban sprawl-related higher local government expenditures. It seems unlikely that the higher expenditures that did not develop due to sprawl in the last 50 years will evolve in the next 20 year, despite predictions to the contrary in The Costs of Sprawl 2000 research.It seems much more likely that the differences in municipal <b>expenditures</b> <b>per</b> capita are the result of political, rather than economic factors, especially the influence of special interests.|$|R
