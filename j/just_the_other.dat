500|$|In 1862 Whistler {{had met the}} English poet Algernon Charles Swinburne, {{with whom}} he {{developed}} a close friendship. The {{relationship between the two}} was mutually beneficial. Inspired by Whistler's Little White Girl, Swinburne wrote a poem with the title [...] "Before the Mirror". Before the painting went on exhibition at the Royal Academy, Whistler pasted the poem written on gold leaf onto the frame. The idea of decorating a painting's frame with a poem was one Whistler had gotten from Rossetti, who had similarly pasted a golden paper with one of his poems on the frame of his 1849 painting The Girlhood of Mary. To Whistler, this poem underlined his idea of the autonomous nature of the painted medium. It showed that painters were more than mere illustrators, and that visual art could be an inspiration for poetry, not <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way around.|$|E
500|$|The York City War Memorial was {{designated}} a grade II listed building (a status which offers statutory protection from demolition or modification, applied to structures of [...] "special interest, warranting {{every effort to}} preserve them") on 10 September 1970 and the gates and piers were separately listed at grade II on 24 June 1983. The nearby NER memorial, <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{side of the city}} walls, was listed at grade II* (defined as [...] "particularly important buildings of more than special interest" [...] and applied to about 5.5% of listed buildings) on 10 September 1970. In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a [...] "national collection" [...] and all of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed; their National Heritage List for England list entries were also updated and expanded. As part of this process, the York City memorial was upgraded from grade II to grade II*.|$|E

2500|$|According to David Ragan's Stars of the '30s, the McCreas were prodigious savers, accumulating a large estate, which {{included}} working-ranch properties. Joel McCrea's work ethic {{was in part}} attributed to his Scottish heritage and it also may have stemmed from his friendship in the 1930s with fellow personality and sometime actor Will Rogers. McCrea recounted that [...] "the Oklahoma Sage" [...] gave him a profound piece of advice: [...] "Save half of what you make, and live on <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> half." ...|$|E

2500|$|Relations {{with other}} Syrian {{political}} opposition groups are generally poor. The Syrian Revolution General Commission, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria or the Supreme Council of the Syrian Revolution oppose the NCC calls to {{dialogue with the}} Syrian government. In September 2012, the Syrian National Council (SNC) reaffirmed that despite broadening its membership, it would not join with [...] "currents close to [...] NCC". Despite recognizing the Free Syrian Army on 23 September 2012, the FSA has dismissed the NCC {{as an extension of}} the government, stating that [...] "this opposition is <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> face of the same coin".|$|E
2500|$|... "Satellite" [...] is a pop song {{written by}} American {{songwriter}} Julie Frost and Danish songwriter John Gordon. Frost told HitQuarters that {{the song is}} about [...] "unconditional love". The lyrics describe the thoughts {{of a woman in}} love ("I got it bad for you"), who is frustrated at being ignored ("I went everywhere for you/ I even did my hair for you/ I bought new underwear they're blue/ And I wore it <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> day.") and compares herself to a lonely traveller ("Like a satellite I'm in orbit all the way around you/ And I would fall out into the night/ Can't go a minute without your love."), {{but on the other hand}} seems to draw a kind of masochistic pleasure from her pain. Gordon has said it is a [...] "bubbly" [...] song, [...] "pretty easy and sweet with cheerful lyrics" [...] and [...] "three chords". Frost, the song's lyricist, explained, [...] "It deals with all the crazy hidden things a girl does and feels when she is in love. A man can make her feel everything at once, joyful but also tormented and helpless." ...|$|E
