40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to explore and provide evidence-based insight on <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> literacy in adolescents? homes. First, a comprehensive systematic review was conducted to understand (1) synthesize the literature on <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> literacy among adolescents, and (2) assess the methodological quality of these studies. The review comprised 38 articles and addressed how researchers conceptualize <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> literacy, their rationale for including some aspects of <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> literacy, and reasons for the methodology utilized. Second, photovoice and Grounded Theory were combined to assess <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> practices {{in the homes of}} four rural families with an adolescent household member. The analysis shows adolescents were encouraged to participate in <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> at home. The adolescents described their cooking experiences as challenging at first, but becoming easier overtime with practice. The adolescents believed <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> at home reduced stress and promoted bonding time with parents, but increased tiredness. On the other hand, the parents of adolescents reported their <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> literacy and teaching strategies emerged from observation, motivation, and direct instruction. Time, age, emotion, and family (grandparents) helped to determine when teaching and learning occurred. Other factors that impacted learning and teaching were resources (T. V., computers), location (home, school), and feedback. Overall, the two studies identified three key findings: (1) not enough work is being done in the area of food preparation; (2) many factors influence how <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> literacy is transmitted; and (3) <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> knowledge and skills are transmitted primarily through informal means. This study provides an initial theoretical model to understand the dynamics of <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> training among adolescents. Further research is needed to test the model qualitatively and better understand the definition in the use of <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> literacy. Health policy advocates or policymakers, health educators, and dietitians may consider developing and testing educational and behavioral interventions related to <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> literacy for adolescents and their parents...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundThe {{amount of}} time spent on <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> and cooking may have {{implications}} for diet quality and health. However, little is known about how food-related time use relates to food consumption and spending, either at restaurants or for food consumed at home. PurposeTo quantitatively assess the associations among the {{amount of time}} habitually spent on <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> and patterns of self-reported food consumption, food spending, and frequency of restaurant use. MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study of 1, 319 adults in a population-based survey conducted in 2008 – 2009. The sample was stratified into those who spent 2 hours/day on <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> and cleanup. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression models examined differences between time-use groups. Analyses were conducted in 2011 – 2013. ResultsIndividuals who spent the least amount of time on <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> tended to be working adults who placed a high priority on convenience. Greater {{amount of time spent}} on home <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> was associated with indicators of higher diet quality, including significantly more frequent intake of vegetables, salads, fruits, and fruit juices. Spending < 1 hour/day on <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> was associated with significantly more money spent on food away from home and more frequent use of fast food restaurants compared to those who spent more time on <b>food</b> <b>preparation.</b> ConclusionsThe findings indicate that time might be an essential ingredient in the production of healthier eating habits among adults. Further research should investigate the determinants of spending time on <b>food</b> <b>preparation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Frequent family {{meals and}} home <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> are {{considered}} important for children 2 ̆ 7 s nutritional health and weight maintenance. This cross-sectional study tested whether these parent-driven behaviors {{are related to}} the availability of <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> supplies in low-income urban households. Caregivers of children ages 6 - 13 provided information on family meal frequency, child consumption of home-prepared dinners, household food insecurity, and attitudes towards cooking. Researchers used a newly developed <b>Food</b> <b>Preparation</b> Checklist (FPC) to assess the availability of 41 <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> supplies during a physical audit of the home environment. Caregivers and children provided anthropometric measurements and jointly reported on child dietary intake. In ordinal logistic regression models, greater home availability of <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> supplies was associated with more frequent family meals and child consumption of home-prepared dinners. Associations were independent of household financial strain, food insecurity, caregiver attitudes toward cooking, and sociodemographic characteristics. Fewer <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> supplies were available in households characterized by greater food insecurity, lower income, and negative caregiver attitudes towards cooking, but did not differ by child or caregiver weight status. As in prior studies, more frequent family meals and consumption of home-prepared dinners were associated with healthier child dietary intake in several areas. We conclude that <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> supplies are often limited in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged households, and their availability is related to the frequency with which children consume family meals and home-prepared dinners. The potential role of <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> supplies as contributors to socioeconomic disparities in child nutritional health and obesity deserves further study...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{factors affecting}} {{the duration of}} eating and <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> among adults in single decision-maker households. Eating time is differentiated into primary and secondary eating time and further differentiated by location: at home versus away from home. We construct a simple theoretical model, based on Becker’s household production approach, to motivate empirical equations for eating and <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> time. Empirical analysis is performed {{using data from the}} 2006 to 2008 Eating and Health Module of the American Time Use Survey. Higher food-at-home prices are found to be associated with more time in <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> and primary eating at home. Higher fast food prices are associated with more time in <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> and less time in primary eating at home. We conclude that food prices influence home production and time allocation decisions. We also find that low-income adults spend more time in <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> and primary eating at home and are less likely to eat away from home than those with more income. The presence of children in the household is associated with more time in <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> and less time in primary eating away from home. Public policies attempting to effect an increase in <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> among low-income, single adult households with children may need to account for limited opportunities such households can have to acquire and prepare healthier foods when additional time is required...|$|R
