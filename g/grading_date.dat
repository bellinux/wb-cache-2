40|$|Purpose: The {{usefulness}} of extensive and repetitive surgery or patients with ovarian cancer still remains un-proven (at least for some conditions). We planned an accurate prospective {{test of the}} hypothesis that patients with advanced-stage disease, after they had reached a clinical complete remission (CR), may benefit from surgi-cal second look (SSL). Patients and Methods: One hundred two patients in CR (as assessed by clinical findings, markers, and visual-ization by computed tomographic [CT] scan and laparos-copy), after initial debulking and first-line chemother-apy, were randomized to two arms, which were well balanced for predictive criteria such as age, stage at pre-sentation, histology, <b>grading,</b> <b>date</b> of randomization, and residua after first surgery.

40|$|Classification of date fruits takes a {{remarkable}} place in food engineering research {{in light of}} the importance of results in designing the equipment for sorting, sizing, and packing. Two techniques were used to classify and grade three varieties of date fruits namely; Berhi, Nubot Saif and Sukkari. The two techniques were Fuzzy Logic (FL) and Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) based on CIE color measurements. FL and NF were effectively applied to serve as a decision support technique in <b>grading</b> <b>date</b> fruits. Grading results obtained from FL and NF showed a good agreement with the results from human experts. The study also showed that fuzzy techniques incorporated into a neural network operation improved the classification performance compared to the fuzzy logic alone. This study suggests that more studies are needed to standardize those methods and use them to automate the grading process...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the phenolic profile of second <b>grade</b> <b>date</b> extracts and evaluate their antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities with regard to some pathogenic microorganisms. Phenolic content was analyzed by HPLC. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the agar disk diffusion method, and in vitro cytotoxic activity was examined by cell proliferation assay. The results revealed that second <b>grade</b> <b>dates</b> presented three benzoic acids, five cinnamic acids and two flavonoids, with the predominance of q-coumaric acid (1998. 80 lg/ 100 g). The antimicrobial activities showed that the date extracts were active against Gram (+) and Gram (-) bacteria, showing marked activity against Escherichia coli with an inhibition zone of 25 mm. Cytotoxicity assays showed that the date extracts were able to inhibit the proliferation of HeLa cell lines. The results confirmed that the date extracts were rich in biologically active compounds that are highly valued in the functional food and nutraceutical industries. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate and optimize the possibility of xanthan gum production by Xanthomonas campestris PTCC 1473 in 500 ml shake flasks on the second <b>grade</b> <b>date</b> palm. Using an experimental response surface methodology (RSM) coupled with a central composite design (CCD), three major independent variables (nitrogen source, phosphor source and agitation rate) were evaluated for their individual and interactive effects on biomass and xanthan gum production in submerged fermentation. The optimum conditions selected for gum production were 3. 15 g. l - 1 for nitrogen source, 5. 03 g. l - 1 for phosphor source, and 394. 8 rpm for agitation rate. Reconfirmation test was conducted, and the experimental value obtained for xanthan production under optimum conditions was about 6. 72 ± 0. 26 g. l - 1, which was close to 6. 51 g. l - 1 as predicted by the model. A higher yield of biomass production was obtained at 13. 74 g. l - 1 for nitrogen source, 4. 66 g. l - 1 for phosphor source, and 387. 42 rpm for agitation rate. In the next stage, scale-up from the shake flasks to the 1 -L batch fermentors was carried. By using the optimum conditions for xanthan gum, the biomass and xanthan gum concentrations after 72 h in three levels of air flow rate (0. 5, 1 and 1. 5 vvm) were obtained as 3. 98, 5. 31 and 6. 04 g. l - 1,and 11. 32, 15. 16 and 16. 84 g. l - 1, respectively. Overall, the second <b>grade</b> <b>date</b> palm seemed to exhibit promising properties that can open new pathways {{for the production of}} efficient and cost-effective xanthan gum...|$|R

30|$|Our study {{indicates}} only little value addition through grading, sorting, and processing. At the date grower’s level there were large value losses due to bird attacks, molds following monsoon rains, improper packing, and poor transport to the market. Overall, improper post-harvest handling led to major losses in produce quality. Walsborn (2008) reported {{the same for}} date palm groves of Iraq where farmers were not sorting and <b>grading</b> <b>dates</b> after harvest. In the current study, most growers threw harvested date bunches to the ground. This not only destroyed dates but also contaminated fruits with dust and sand, which was affecting their quality. Walsborn (2008) observed similar problems at date harvesting in Iraq and Elshafia and Salih (1984) showed that harvesting by ropes reduced fruit losses up to 45  %.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method to <b>grade</b> the <b>date</b> fruits {{based on the}} combination of shape and texture features. The method begins with reducing the specular reflection and small noise using a bilateral filter. Threshold based segmentation is performed for background removal and fruit part selection from the given image. Shape features is extracted using the contour of the date fruit and texture features are extracted using Curvelet transform and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) from the selected date fruit region. Finally, combinations of shape and texture features are fused to <b>grade</b> the <b>dates</b> into six <b>grades.</b> k-Nearest Neighbour(k-NN) classifier yields the best grading rate compared to other two classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant(LDA) classifiers.

40|$|Chromium ore {{deposits}} {{range in}} age from 3. 5 -billion year-old chromite in the Selukwe greenstone belt (Zimbabwe) to the ophiolite-hosted Miocene deposits of New Caledonia. They provide indications of the evolving earth's tectonic processes in oceanic and continental crust and mantle. Podiform orebodies are hosted in peridotites, mostly now regarded as the remains of ob-ducted ophiolite complexes. They imply ocean spreading at their sites of original crystalliza-tion, and plate convergence where subsequently reemplaced by thrusting. Known ophiolites with chromite deposits date at 800 Ma or younger. Chromite deposits in Archcan green-stones resemble the ophiolite ores in respect to their peridotitc host rocks, shapes, and in-tense deformation but are recognizably cumulate ores. They are hosted in large ultramafic-mafic sill-like complexes in simatic volcanic sequences, suggesting that the Early Archcan ocean crust may have been more ultramafic in composition than at present.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the prevalence of}} date violence and rape among adolescents {{in order to examine}} the associations between date violence and rape, and eating disorders and psychopathology. The study also attempted to determine if these associations remained significant after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. A Minnesota school-based sample of 81, 247 boys and girls in grades 9 and 12 completed the Minnesota Student Survey. Overall, approximately 9 % of the girls and 6 % of the boys reported date rape or violence. Significant differences were found across race and <b>grade.</b> <b>Date</b> violence and rape was associated with higher rates of disordered eating and suicide behaviors, and lower scores on measures of emotional well-being and self-esteem.
