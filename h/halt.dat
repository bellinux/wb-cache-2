2500|$|Similarly, {{for every}} set S in , both S and its {{complement}} are in [...] {{and are therefore}} (by Post's theorem) recursively enumerable by some Turing machines T1 and T2, respectively. For every number n, exactly one of these <b>halts.</b> We may therefore construct a Turing machine T that alternates between T1 and T2, <b>halting</b> and returning 1 when the former <b>halts</b> or <b>halting</b> and returning 0 when the latter <b>halts.</b> Thus T <b>halts</b> on every n and returns whether it is in S, So S is computable.|$|R
50|$|Knowing {{the first}} N bits of &Omega;, one could {{calculate}} the <b>halting</b> problem for all programs {{of a size}} up to N. Let the program p for which the <b>halting</b> problem is to be solved be N bits long. In dovetailing fashion, all programs of all lengths are run, until enough have <b>halted</b> to jointly contribute enough probability to match these first N bits. If the program p hasn't <b>halted</b> yet, then it never will, since its contribution to the <b>halting</b> probability would affect the first N bits. Thus, the <b>halting</b> problem would be solved for p.|$|R

5|$|Motte, {{without power}} to <b>halt</b> the {{introduction}} of Faulkner's work on his own, asked Swift to intervene, but Swift passively refused. Even without the backing of Swift, Motte turned to the English legal system to <b>halt</b> {{the introduction of}} Faulkner's edition. Motte issued a Bill of Complaint and sued under the Statute of Anne, claiming that Faulkner's publishing of the 1735 Works infringed on his right to publish works like Gulliver's Travels. The case was heard by the Court of Chancery, and they agreed with Motte in a ruling by Lord Talbot, the Lord Chancellor of Great Britain. In the 28 November 1735, it was determined Motte could put forth an injunction to the whole of Swift's works. Although works like the Drapier's Letters were not under Motte's copyright and some works were printed before 1709, Faulkner's complete work was legally brought to a <b>halt</b> from being published in England.|$|E
5|$|On 25 September 1905, {{following}} lobbying by Ickenham Parish Council, the Metropolitan Railway {{opened a}} small <b>halt</b> on their line between Harrow and Uxbridge. The railway {{company had been}} reluctant to open a station in the area due to a perceived lack of demand, and so a compromise was reached {{with the construction of}} the <b>halt.</b> The new stop brought with it travellers from London seeking a day out in rural surroundings. Nearby villagers sold flowers from their gardens and served teas to the visitors. The parish council later requested shelters for passengers on the platforms, which were built in December 1905, followed by a booking hut in 1910. The original platforms, too short to align with all train carriages, were extended in 1922. Ickenham <b>Halt</b> was rebuilt as a station in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{programs}} that, for some inputs, return a correct {{answer to the}} <b>halting</b> problem, while for other inputs they do not return an answer at all. However the problem ″given program p, is it a partial <b>halting</b> solver″ (in the sense described) {{is at least as}} hard as the <b>halting</b> problem.To see this, assume that there is an algorithm PHSR (″partial <b>halting</b> solver recognizer″) to do that. Then {{it can be used to}} solve the <b>halting</b> problem,as follows:To test whether input program x <b>halts</b> on y, construct a program p that on input (x,y) reports true and diverges on all other inputs.Then test p with PHSR.|$|R

The crowd shrank back and the soldiers were allowed continue until they had advanced to {{the offices of the}} newspaper, the Baltimore American, near Holliday Street, where an order was given to <b>halt</b> and two volleys fired into the crowd. They were forced to <b>halt</b> a third time as they turned onto Charles Street, and again fired on the crowd near Light Street. There two men and one boy were killed.

Both Dorton <b>Halt</b> and Brill and Ludgersall stations were closed on 7 January 1963; the line remains in use by trains between Princes Risborough and Bicester North.
