40|$|The Lunar Cargo Transportation and Landing by Soft Touchdown (Lunar CATALYST) {{program is}} {{establishing}} multiple no-funds-exchanged Space Act Agreement (SAA) partnerships with U. S. private sector entities. The {{purpose of this}} program is to encourage the development of robotic lunar landers that can be integrated with U. S. commercial launch capabilities to deliver payloads to the lunar surface. NASA can share technology and expertise under the SAA {{for the benefit of}} the CATALYST partners. MSFC seeking to vacuum test Augmented Spark Impinging (ASI) igniter with methane and new exciter units to support CATALYST partners and NASA programs. ASI has previously been used/tested successfully at sea-level, with both O 2 /CH 4 and O 2 /H 2 propellants. Conventional <b>ignition</b> <b>exciter</b> systems historically experienced corona discharge issues in vacuum. Often utilized purging or atmospheric sealing on high voltage lead to remedy. Compact systems developed since PCAD could eliminate the high-voltage lead and directly couple the exciter to the spark igniter. MSFC developed Augmented Spark Impinging (ASI) igniter. Successfully used in several sea-level test programs. Plasma-assisted design. Portion of ox flow is used to generate hot plasma. Impinging flows downstream of plasma. Additional fuel flow down torch tube sleeve for cooling near stoichiometric torch flame. Testing done at NASA GRC Altitude Combustion Stand (ACS) facility 2000 -lbf class facility with altitude simulation up to around 100, 000 ft. (0. 2 psia [10 Torr]) via nitrogen driven ejectors. Propellant conditioning systems can provide temperature control of LOX/CH 4 up to test article...|$|E
5|$|The sealed {{spark gap}} {{assemblies}} in <b>ignition</b> <b>exciters</b> in some older jet engines contain {{a small amount}} of krypton-85 to produce consistent ionization levels and uniform operation.|$|R
50|$|Usually {{there are}} two igniter plugs in {{different}} positions in the combustion system. A high voltage spark is used to ignite the gases. The voltage is stored up from a low voltage (usually 28 V DC) supply provided by the aircraft batteries. It builds up to the right value in the <b>ignition</b> <b>exciters</b> (similar to automotive ignition coils) and is then released as a high energy spark. Depending on various conditions, such as flying through heavy rainfall, the igniter continues to provide sparks to prevent combustion from failing if the flame inside goes out. Of course, {{in the event that}} the flame does go out, there must be provision to relight. There is a limit of altitude and air speed at which an engine can obtain a satisfactory relight.|$|R
