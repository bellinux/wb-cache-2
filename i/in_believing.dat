The Democrats, the Brindle Tails, and all non-Republican newspapers openly and vocally denounced the election as fraudulent, and insisted that Brooks had in fact received the most votes. The general citizenry of both parties, however, accepted the results. The Brooks supporters were in the minority <b>in</b> <b>believing</b> that the election had been fraudulent.|$|E
5|$|Cho Ki-chon {{was born}} to poor Korean peasants {{in the village of}} Ael'tugeu in the Vladivostok District of the Russian Far East on 6 November 1913. The Pacific region of the Soviet Union, where he lived, was a center for Korean {{independence}} activists. He particularly drew literary inspiration from , a fellow Korean writer living in the Soviet Union who– <b>in</b> <b>believing</b> in national emancipation by upholding socialist principles– had already written about anti-Japanese guerillas. Thus he acquired a nationalistic and class conscious worldview in his literature.|$|E

5|$|While {{some other}} designs use clamps to couple the disc to the platter, Roksan shares the same {{philosophy}} as Linn <b>in</b> <b>believing</b> that rigid coupling would cause rumble to be transmitted {{from the main}} bearing, thus colouring the sound.

5|$|After {{becoming}} a cause célèbre {{from the late}} 1960s to the 1980s, the mythical Priory of Sion was exposed as a ludibrium created by Plantard {{as a framework for}} his claim of being the Great Monarch prophesied by Nostradamus. Evidence presented in support of its historical existence and activities before 1956 was discovered to have been forged and then planted in various locations around France by Plantard and his accomplices. Nevertheless, many conspiracy theorists still persist <b>in</b> <b>believing</b> that the Priory of Sion is an age-old cabal that conceals a subversive secret.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{cultures}} {{around the}} Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus {{made a series}} of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing. Thales was incorrect <b>in</b> <b>believing</b> the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.|$|E

Đôn insisted Nhu had orchestrated the raids, fearing that the generals had too much power. He asserted that Nhu used the cover of martial law to discredit the generals by dressing the Special Forces in ARVN uniforms. Đôn insisted that {{he was unaware of}} the plans and was at Joint General Staff headquarters with Khiêm when he received a radio message informing him of the assaults.

5|$|The {{house was}} built for Sir Edmund Wright, who became Lord Mayor of London in 1640. The brick {{structure}} dates from between 1629 and 1638. In 1629, Wright purchased the grounds from John Bingley, who had undertaken extensive remedial work on an existing 13th century structure in the grounds—probably timber-framed and wattle filled. Bingley's alterations {{were said to have}} been detrimental to the condition of the house and grounds. He was accused of driving away almost all the birds in the dovehouse, and of pulling up many healthy fruit-bearing trees from the orchard. The house had a moat, which Bingley filled <b>in,</b> <b>believing</b> the water to be unhealthy, at which point he also had a defensive brick wall built around the house.|$|E

25|$|In 1960, James E. Böhlke and C.

In 1995, John E. Randall expressed doubts as to the validity of this move. He was supported by ichthyologists Ray S. Birdsong and even Robins himself <b>in</b> <b>believing</b> that Rhinogobiops is in fact distinct from Coryphopterus.|$|E
25|$|Professor Taylor {{offered a}} gas {{theory of the}} explosion, in which he contended that {{deflagration}} would cause a pressure of gas to build up sufficiently quickly in the vaults - the entrance to which was small and through the roof—to cause the explosion. The difficulty with this explanation was <b>in</b> <b>believing</b> that the vaults were well enough sealed as to result in an explosion, when a more gradual forcing up of the cellar roof might more reasonably be anticipated.|$|E
25|$|Galen {{believed}} {{there to be}} no distinction between the mental and the physical. This was a controversial argument of the time, and Galen fell with the Greeks <b>in</b> <b>believing</b> that the mind and body were not separate faculties. He believed {{that this could be}} scientifically proven. This was where his opposition to the Stoics became most prevalent. Galen proposed organs within the body to be responsible for specific functions, rather than individual parts. According to Galen, the Stoics' lack of scientific justification discredited their claims of the separateness of mind and body, which is why he spoke so strongly against them.|$|E

He had five wives, and when Livingstone told him to get rid of four of them, it shook the foundations of the Kwena tribe. After he finally divorced the women, Livingstone baptised them all and everything went well. However, one year later one of his ex-wives became pregnant and Sechele was the father. Sechele begged Livingstone to not give up on him because his faith was still strong, but Livingstone left the country and went north to continue his Christianizing attempts.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Darwin {{returned}} from the Beagle survey expedition in 1836, {{he had begun to}} doubt Lyell's ideas about the permanence of species.

Lyell was also a friend of Darwin's closest colleagues, Hooker and Huxley, but unlike them he struggled to square his religious beliefs with evolution. This inner struggle has been much commented on.

25|$|India's pro-Arab {{policy had}} mixed success. Establishment of {{close ties with}} the socialist and secular Baathist regimes to some extent {{neutralized}} Pakistani propaganda against India. However, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 put the Arab and Muslim states of the Middle East in a dilemma as the war was fought by two states both friendly to the Arabs. The progressive Arab regimes in Egypt, Syria, and Algeria chose to remain neutral, while the conservative pro-American Arab monarchies in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and United Arab Emirates openly supported Pakistan. Egypt's stance was met with dismay by the Indians, {{who had come to}} expect close co-operation with the Baathist regimes. But, the death of Nasser in 1970 and Sadat's growing friendship with Riyadh, and his mounting differences with Moscow, constrained Egypt to a policy of neutrality. Gandhi's overtures to Muammar Gaddafi were rebuffed. Libya agreed with the Arab monarchies <b>in</b> <b>believing</b> that Gandhi's intervention in East Pakistan was an attack against Islam.|$|E
