We emphasize motionally induced horizontal electric fields (HEF) and bottom pressure and Inverted Echo Sounders (PIES) for measuring ocean velocities from a bottom lander. OBJECTIVES The primary objectives of this observational program are to observe the North Equatorial Current (NEC) as it bifurcates into the Kuroshio and Mindanao currents (i. e., KC and MC, respectively) and determine the volume transports of the Kuroshio off NE Luzon Is. The plan was also to reveal interactions between the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and the strong mesoscale eddies. The HEF and PIES provided barotropic and baroclinic velocity components.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{method of}} observing the sea surface height {{has been to}} make shipboard measurements of the vertical - density profile, and then calculating the surface height relative to a deeper reference surface. Two methods (a moored vertical string of instruments and an <b>inverted</b> <b>echo</b> <b>sounder)</b> were subsequently developed to obtain longer time in situ measurements. The first of these {{can be thought of}} as an extension of the discrete bottle hydrocast while the second integrates acoustically over the water column. One purpose of this note is to compare the result when coincidental observations are made by these two methods. This was done at two sites in the western tropical Pacific. Two inverted echo sounders were deployed alongside two enhanced TOGA-COARE moorings to be used in an in situ evaluation of TOPEX/Poseidon altimetric measurements of sea surface height. The mooring and <b>inverted</b> <b>echo</b> <b>sounder</b> data reproduced one another, at low frequency, with a correlation of 0. 93 and 0. 95 and the altimeter correlated with each of the above values ranging from 0. 84 to 0. 94.

40|$|The <b>Inverted</b> <b>Echo</b> <b>Sounder</b> (IES) is {{an ocean}} bottom-moored {{instrument}} that measures the vertical acoustic travel time (VATT) round-trip {{from the sea}} floor to the sea surface and back. The VATT varies principally due {{to changes in the}} temperature profile of the water column, making the IES well-suited for monitoring changes in temperature structure and dynamic height (baroclinic signal). Currently, the Model 6. 2, a combined IES, data-logger, and acoustic release, with optional measurements of bottom pressure, temperature and current speed and direction (with attached AanderaaTM Doppler current sensor) is produced at URI/GSO. Data are processed in situ and are available (optional) remotely by an acoustic telemetry link or expendable, satellite-link data shuttle. In addition to the IES-measured baroclinic signals, barotropic near-bottom pressure variations may be measured with the optional pressure sensor. A report was written in 1991 describing IES data processing (Fields et al., 1991). Since that report, significant improvements have been made to both IES hardware and software, warranting an update of the IES data processing. This report will document standard processing steps currently carried out for IES Models 6. 1 and 6. 2 at URI/GSO.

We calculate power spectra of these SSDH anomalies to discuss time-scale dependency of their differences. The differences between two SSDH anomalies are found mainly caused by components with the periods from 50 days to 100 days, which correspond to meso-scale eddies or small meanders of the Kuroshio.

Information on landings per trip, number of crew, fishing days per trip, diesel consumed per trip, gross registered tonnage and horsepower of vessels were gathered and analyzed using two approaches namely, Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The determinants of technical inefficiency (family background, age, years of experience as a captain and education level of fishermen together with age of vessel and possession of <b>echo</b> <b>sounder)</b> were analyzed using SFA and Tobit regression.

40|$|Data {{from six}} <b>inverted</b> <b>echo</b> <b>sounder</b> {{moorings}} and the Geosat satellite altimeter {{are used to}} examine the seasonal variability of sea surface elevation. Monthly sea level maps are constructed using a contemporaneous subsurface temperature survey to provide a reference sea level field. The maps are then used to describe the origin and structure of the western tropical Atlantic North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) during a two-year period beginning in November 1987. The data reveal a zonal current which is confined between 3 deg N and 9 deg N with a typical width of 300 km. The NECC flows strongly eastward during November and December 1986 and May 1987 through January 1988. The reappearance of the current is then delayed until August, but the current flows strongly from August {{until the end of the}} record in October 1988. Volume transport is estimated for the two-year period from surface elevation by approximating the vertical structure of the ocean as a two-layer fluid.

For a set of 4 IES records from the Newfoundland Basin the estimate of the accuracy of the geopotential height anomaly (integrated between 100 and 4000 db) calibrated from the IES measurements was reduced from 0. 65 m 2 s Γ 2 to 0. 52 m 2 s Γ 2, which is a substantial reduction toward the intrinsic scatter of the geopotential height anomaly versus travel time relationship for this region (0. 42 m 2 s Γ 2).

40|$|Profiles of {{absolute}} velocity {{are difficult to}} obtain in the ocean, especially {{over long periods of}} time at the same location. This paper presents a method of estimating full water column absolute horizontal velocity profiles as a function of time by combining historical hydrography with the measurements from two separate instruments, the <b>inverted</b> <b>echo</b> <b>sounder</b> (IES) and the horizontal electric field recorder (HEFR). Hydrography is used to construct temperature, salinity, and specific volume anomaly characteristics as functions of the independent variables pressure and seafloor-to-sea-surface round-trip acoustic travel time (t). Each IES measured t is com-bined with these two-dimensional characteristics to estimate the profile of specific volume anomaly, which then is integrated vertically to obtain profiles of geopotential height anomaly (Df). Profiles of Df from adjacent IES sites are differenced to yield vertical profiles of relative geostrophic velocity. Horizontal electric fields arising from the vertically averaged horizontal water velocity provide the requisite referencing of the IES-derived relative velocities. Comparisons are presented between HEFR 1 IES absolute velocities in the Southern Ocean near 518 S, 143. 58 E and absolute velocities determined via hydrography, acoustic Doppler current profiler, and current meter. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{procedures}} {{used in the}} Synoptic Ocean Prediction experiment for calibration of <b>inverted</b> <b>echo</b> <b>sounder</b> (IES) travel time t data have led to substantially improved accuracy. In previous work, t was converted to main thermocline depth ZT using point measurements of the 128 C depth from coincident expendable bathythermograph (XBT) casts. The new method presented in this study vertically integrates the XBT temperature to produce the quantity QT, which is very tightly related to t. The advantage of this method is that the calibration constants have roughly half the uncertainty obtained with the traditional method. Seasonal changes in t determined from hydrographic data in the Gulf Stream region were found to vary with geographic region; near 688 W t changed by 1. 8 ms from March to September, whereas near Cape Hatteras the annual change was only 1. 0 ms. The fully calibrated IES has an estimated error of 19 m (one standard deviation). An iterative optimal interpolationZ*T scheme is described, by which the Gulf Stream thermocline depth was mapped on a two-dimensional grid. Initially, daily maps were generated using established mapping techniques. Subsequently, these maps were averaged for 31 -day periods and in turn used as the new ‘‘mean fields’ ’ for the final maps.
