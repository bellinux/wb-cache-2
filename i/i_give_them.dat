[...] In his autobiography, {{he recalled}} the experience: [...] "As the students filed out, he singled me out from the crowd and asked me what I was doing. I responded, 'Well, Dr. Freud, I start where you leave off. You meet people in the artificial setting of your office. I meet them {{on the street and}} in their homes, in their natural surroundings. You analyze their dreams. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> the courage to dream again. You analyze and tear them apart. I let them act out their conflicting roles and help them to put the parts back together again.'" ...|$|E

500|$|When {{working with}} actors, Nolan prefers {{giving them the}} time to perform as many takes of a given scene as they want. [...] "I've {{come to realize that}} the {{lighting}} and camera setups, the technical things, take all the time, but running another take generally only adds a couple of minutes.... If an actor tells me they can do something more with a scene, <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> the chance, because it's not going to cost that much time. It can't all be about the technical issues." [...] Gary Oldman praised the director for providing a relaxed atmosphere on set, adding [...] "I've never seen him raise his voice to anyone". He also observed that Nolan would give the actors space to [...] "find things in the scene", and not just give direction for direction's sake.|$|E

[...] "I was a foreign correspondent for the paper, and it had taken me weeks of negotiations, dealing with shady contacts and a lot of walking to reach the cigar-smoking Karen twins– the boy soldiers who were leading attacks against the country's ruling junta. After I had reached them and written a cover story for the newspaper's G2 section, I {{got a call from the}} BBC's documentary department, which was researching a film on child soldiers.

We have accepted this mission, to defend order and to re-organize the country. When order has been re-established, the country will have the liberty to choose as it wishes whatever will be its future destiny." [...] Thiers declared that the country needed to unite behind the Republic; he stated his famous formula, [...] "The Republic is the form of government that divides us the least." ...|$|E

2500|$|After a gap {{of about}} a month, Max starts writing to Martin at home, {{carrying}} only what looks like business and remarks about the weather, but writing as though they have a hidden encoded meaning, with strange references to exact dimensions of pictures and so on. The letters refer to [...] "our grandmother" [...] and imply that Martin is also Jewish. The letters from Munich to San Francisco get shorter and more panicky, begging Max to stop: [...] "My God, Max, {{do you know what}} you do? ... These letters you have sent ... are not delivered, but they bring me in and ... demand <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> the code ... I beg you, Max, no more, no more! Stop while I can be saved." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 30 July 1914, {{on the eve}} of the First World War, Law {{met with}} Asquith and agreed to {{temporarily}} suspend the issue of Home Rule to avoid domestic discontent during wartime. By the following day both leaders had convinced their parties to agree to this move. On 3 August Law spoke openly in the House of Commons, saying that [...] "the Government already know, but <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> now the assurance on behalf of the party of which I am leader in this House, that in whatever steps they think it necessary to take for the honour and security of this country they can rely upon the unhesitating support of the Opposition". The following night, Germany rejected British demands for a withdrawal from Belgium, and Britain declared war.|$|E
2500|$|The classic Bible passage cited {{to prove}} a limited extent to the atonement is [...] in which Jesus uses {{shepherding}} practices {{as a metaphor for}} his relationship to his followers. A shepherd of those times would call his sheep from a mix of flocks, and his sheep would hear his voice and follow, while the sheep of other flocks would ignore any but their own shepherd's voice.. In that context, Jesus says, [...] "I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, ...and I lay down my life for the sheep," [...] and he tells the Pharisees that they [...] "do not believe because [...] are not part of [...] flock." [...] He continues, [...] "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand." [...] Since Calvinists (and many other Christians) believe that not all have eternal life with God, Calvinists conclude that there are only two possibilities: either Jesus was wrong in saying that he would lose none of his sheep (a conclusion they reject), or Jesus must not have laid down his life for everyone, as they understand [...] to imply. Formally, the Calvinist position can be expressed this way: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{left them}} my fire-arms, viz. five-muskets, three fowling-pieces; and three swords. I had above a barrel {{and a half}} of powder left; for after the first year or two I used but little, and wasted none. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> a {{description}} of the way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, and to make both butter and cheese: in a word, <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> every part of my own story; and told them I should prevail with the captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden seeds, which I told them I would have been very glad of: also <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> the bag of peas which the captain had brought me to eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increase them.|$|R
5000|$|About Bastien-Thiry, de Gaulle said [...] "The French need martyrs ... They {{must choose}} them carefully. <b>I</b> could have <b>given</b> <b>them</b> {{one of those}} idiotic generals playing ball in Tulle prison. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> Bastien-Thiry. They'll {{be able to make}} a martyr of him. He deserves it." ...|$|R

2500|$|I {{think it}} was the first summer I was at Harvard as a student, and I {{discovered}} a wonderful bookstore there where I could get modern poetry – which I'd never been able to lay my hands on very much until then – and they had the original edition of The Darkening Ecliptic with the Sidney Nolan cover. [...] I always had a taste for sort of wild experimental poetry – of which there really wasn't very much in English in America at the time – and this poet suited me very well. [...] I am obliged to give a final examination in my poetry writing course , which I'm always rather hard put to do, since we haven't really studied anything. The students have been writing poems of varying degrees of merit, and though <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> reading lists they tend to ignore them, after first demanding them. And the way the course is set up {{there is no way of}} examining them on their reading. And anyway they shouldn't have to pass an examination because they're poets who are writing poetry, and I don't like the idea of grading poems. So in order to pass the examination time I had to think of various subterfuges, and one of them is to use one of Malley's poems and another forbiddingly modern poem – frequently one of Geoffrey Hill's 'Mercian Hymns'. And asking them if they can guess which one is the real poem by a respected contemporary poet, and which one is a put-on intended to ridicule modern poetry, and what are their reasons. And I think they are right about fifty per cent of the time, identifying the fraud... fraudulent poem.|$|E

5000|$|Berro's brother, after {{apparently}} identifying Berro in a photograph, now {{denies that}} Berro had {{any role in}} the attack. [...] "They changed the truth," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> the photo Berro at 17 years old, but when I saw photo in the news, I said, 'How are they publishing the photo that <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> a few months back?

6000|$|... 2. Ezekiel also is {{punctual}} as to this: I caused them, saith God by that prophet, 'to {{go forth}} {{out of the}} land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.
