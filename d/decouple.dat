Around 10:30UTC on June8, Blanca made landfall over Isla Santa Margarita {{off the coast of}} Baja California Sur before striking the mainland, near Puerto Argudin, at 11:15UTC. This marked the earliest known landfall in the state, and peninsula, on record during a calendar year. It surpassed the previous earliest—Tropical Storm Calvin on July8, 1993—by a month. Turning back to the northwest, the system briefly emerged back over the Pacific Ocean before weakening to a tropical depression. Blanca made its third and final landfall near El Patrocinio around 20:30UTC. With deep convection no longer present, the depression degraded into a remnant low early on June9 over the central Baja California peninsula before dissipating hours later.|$|E
5|$|In June 1999, the {{contract}} to jointly develop and produce the Chengdu FC-1/Super 7 was signed. The project {{was to be a}} 50:50 partnership; the air forces of both countries would be committed to ordering the fighter. After GEC-Marconi had abandoned the bidding to supply an integrated avionics suite, FIAR and Thomson-CSF proposed a number of avionics suites based on the Grifo S7 and RC400 radars respectively, despite previously hoping to use the PAF's Super 7 to launch its new Blue Hawk radar. Because of sanctions placed on Pakistan after the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests, design work progressed very slowly over the next 18 months, preventing delivery of the Western avionics to the PAF. In early 2001, the PAF decided to <b>decouple</b> the airframe from the avionics, enabling design work on the aircraft to continue. As the airframe was developed, any new avionics requirements by the PAF could be more easily integrated into the airframe.|$|E
5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis precipitated in 2007 and 2008 shared {{some of the}} key features exhibited by the wave of international financial crises in the 1990s, including accelerated capital influxes, weak regulatory frameworks, relaxed monetary policies, herd behavior during investment bubbles, collapsing asset prices, and massive deleveraging. The systemic problems originated in the United States and other advanced nations. Similarly to the 1997 Asian crisis, the global crisis entailed broad lending by banks undertaking unproductive real estate investments as well as poor standards of corporate governance within financial intermediaries. Particularly in the United States, the crisis was characterized by growing securitization of non-performing assets, large fiscal deficits, and excessive financing in the housing sector. While the real estate bubble in the U.S. triggered the financial crisis, the bubble was financed by foreign capital flowing from many different countries. As its contagious effects began infecting other nations, the crisis became a precursor for the global economic downturn now referred to as the Great Recession. In the wake of the crisis, total volume of world trade in goods and services fell 10% from 2008 to 2009 and did not recover until 2011, with an increased concentration in emerging market countries. The {{global financial}} crisis demonstrated the negative effects of worldwide financial integration, sparking discourse on how and whether some countries should <b>decouple</b> themselves from the system altogether.|$|E

40|$|Unprecedented {{economic}} {{achievement in}} China has occurred along with rising resource consumption and waste productions levels. The goal of sustainability requires the <b>decoupling</b> {{of economic growth}} from resource consumption (resource <b>decoupling)</b> and environmental degradation (impact <b>decoupling).</b> For this paper, the performances of resource <b>decoupling</b> (energy and water) and impact <b>decoupling</b> (wastewater, SO 2 and CO 2) in China were evaluated, and the spatial pattern and temporal trend of <b>decoupling</b> performance were investigated by using the rescaled range analysis (R/S). The results indicate the following. (1) The performance of resource <b>decoupling</b> during the investigated period is worse than that of traditional impact (SO 2 and wastewater) <b>decoupling,</b> but better {{than that of the}} CO 2 emission. Additionally, the <b>decoupling</b> performances of energy consumption and related pollutant emission (except CO 2) are better than that of water usage and wastewater discharge; (2) The <b>decoupling</b> performance of energy consumption, SO 2 and CO 2, has substantially improved from the 10 th Five-Year Planning Period (FYP) (2001 – 2005) to the 11 th FYP (2006 – 2010), which indicates that the <b>decoupling</b> performance is highly related the environmental policy; (3) The spatial disparities of the performance of resource and impact <b>decoupling</b> are declining, which indicates the existence of cross-province convergence in <b>decoupling</b> performance; (4) The <b>decoupling</b> performance of SO 2 and water usage in most of regions shows an improving trend. Inversely, the <b>decoupling</b> performance of energy consumption, CO 2 emission, and wastewater discharge in most regions show a decreasing trend; (5) China needs more stringent water-saving targets and wastewater discharge standards; better policy efforts to improve the water recycling level both in agricultural, industrial and municipal level are required to prevent the decreasing trend of the <b>decoupling</b> performance...|$|R
25|$|The {{structure}} of {{the cosmic microwave background}} anisotropies is principally determined by two effects: acoustic oscillations and diffusion damping (also called collisionless damping or Silk damping). The acoustic oscillations arise because of a conflict in the photon–baryon plasma in the early universe. The pressure of the photons tends to erase anisotropies, whereas the gravitational attraction of the baryons, moving at speeds much slower than light, makes them tend to collapse to form overdensities. These two effects compete to create acoustic oscillations, which give the microwave background its characteristic peak structure. The peaks correspond, roughly, to resonances in which the photons <b>decouple</b> when a particular mode is at its peak amplitude.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} (1) covariance between environment and competition, and (2) species-specific {{response to the}} environment <b>decouple</b> the strongest intraspecific and interspecific competition experienced by a species. Intraspecific competition is strongest when a species is favored by the environment, whereas interspecific competition is strongest when its rivals are favored. After this decoupling, buffered population growth limits the impact of interspecific competition when a species is not favored by the environment. As a consequence, the impact of intraspecific competition on the species favored by a particular environment exceeds that of the interspecific competition on species less favored by that environment. We see that the fundamental requirement for species coexistence is fulfilled and thus storage effect is able to maintain stable coexistence {{in a community of}} competing species.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Sicking {{turned his}} {{attention}} to impact energy management in sports. Serious neck injuries in hockey are relatively infrequent but can be catastrophic. Impacts with the rigid walls can produce decelerations of over 100 G’s, causing severe concussions and even quadriplegia. Sicking led the creation of energy absorbing walls that have been shown to successfully reduce head decelerations by 50% under severe impact conditions. These walls are designed to flex and extend during impacts, reducing peak G’s on the player’s head by absorbing the energy of the impact. Sicking is now applying this same concept to develop both improved helmet impact performance standards and a helmet that is more flexible and can <b>decouple</b> head rotation from helmet rotation, thus reducing peak G’s on the head.|$|E

25|$|Utricularia have {{significantly}} greater respiration rates than most vegetative tissue, {{primarily due to}} their complex energy-dependent traps. Upon triggering, prey is captured through a two-step ATP-driven ion-pumping process where organisms are sucked in by internal negative pressure achieved by pumping {{water out of the}} trap and into the external environment. Recent research suggests that COX subunit I (COX1), a rate limiting enzyme in the cellular respiration pathway associated with the synthesis of ATP, has evolved under positive Darwinian selection in the Utricularia–Genlisea clade. There appear to be adaptive substitutions of two contiguous cysteines (C-C motif) at the docking point of COX1 helix 3 and cytochrome c. This C-C motif, absent in ~99.9% of databased Eukaryota, Archaea, and Bacteria, suggests a conformational change that might <b>decouple</b> electron transport from proton pumping. Such decoupling would allow Utricularia to optimize power output (energy × rate) during times of need, albeit with a 20% cost in energy efficiency.|$|E
