50|$|The huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus), {{also known}} as the South Andean deer, is found in Chile and Argentina. <b>Huemuls</b> live in groups of varying size, {{typically}} of two or three individuals, but sometimes as many as eleven. In the past, groups of over a hundred deer were reported. Groups are made up of a female and her young, while males are often alone.|$|E
50|$|Animals include river otters (Lontra longicaudis), {{southern}} Andean <b>huemuls</b> (Hippocamelus bisulcus), pudus (small deer), foxes, cougars, guanacos and maras. Huillin (Lontra provocax), {{an endangered}} native otter, {{has been reported}} in the park. Birds reported include Magellanic woodpeckers, green austral parakeets, geese, ducks, swans, blue-eyed cormorants, Andean condors (Vultur gryphus) and green-backed firecrowns (Saphonoides sephaniodes). Amphibian fauna reported are Hylorina sylvatica and Bufo spinolosus. Five genera and 32 species of Simuliidae (black fly) have been recorded. These genera are Cnesia, Cnesiamima, Gigantodax, Paraustrasimulium, and Simulium (Pternaspatha), a subgenus of Simulium with 19 species; these account for 57% of the Simuliidae fauna found in Argentina.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Argentina {{has taken}} some actions to {{implement}} the national plans. These include monitoring in the Los Alerces National Park, new Huemul survey work in Estancia Los Huemules, and continued updating of a database of records maintained by the National Parks Administration for both protected and unprotected areas. Contributions {{have been made to}} a study of the phylogeography and demographic history of the Huemul by Bio-Bio University in Chile. Work has also been underway in Argentina to update the management plans for the Lanín National Park and the Andino Norpatagónica Biosphere Reserve, with specific reference to measures for Huemul conservation. A project proposal has been developed for controlling livestock in the area occupied by <b>Huemuls</b> in the Los Alerces National Park. Awareness activities have included public talks, production of a two booklet on the conservation of the species linked to the Andino Norpatagónica Biosphere Reserve, and posters distributed in three of the country’s National Parks.|$|E

40|$|To {{assist with}} {{conservation}} of Endangered Patagonian <b>Huemul</b> Deer (Hippocamelus bisulcus), the <b>Huemul</b> Task Force (HTF) reassessed information on appendicular morphology, paleobiogeography, and historical distribution as potential factors in recovery efforts. Traditional claims {{of being a}} mountain specialist of the Andes were refuted by empirical evidence showing <b>huemul</b> morphology to coincide with other cervids rather than the commonly implied homology to rock-climbing ungulates. It thus supports historical evidence of <b>huemul</b> in treeless habitat and reaching the Atlantic coast, which cannot be dismissed as past erroneous observations. Instead, pre- and post-Columbian anthropogenic impacts resulted in <b>huemul</b> displacement from productive sites and in survival mainly in remote and marginal refuge areas. The process of range contraction was facilitated by easy hunting of <b>huemul,</b> energetic incentives from seasonal fat cycles and <b>huemul</b> concentrations, the change from hunting-gathering to a mobile equestrian economy, and colonization with livestock. However, areas used presently by <b>huemul,</b> as supposed mountain specialists, are also used by wild and domestic ungulates that clearly are not considered mountain specialists, whereas the only other Hippocamelus successfully uses areas homologous to tree-less Patagonia. Rigid application of modern habitat usage to infer past habitat use and ignoring historic extra-Andean accounts is unwarranted; these conclusions reached by the HTF indicate new opportunities for recovery efforts by considering morphological and historical evidence. For instance, reintroductions to other portions of the landscape used formerly by <b>huemul,</b> {{which tend to be}} more productive sites than those currently occupied by many <b>huemul</b> groups, would present a promising avenue...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Huemul</b> Project (Proyecto <b>Huemul)</b> was {{an early}} 1950s Argentine effort to develop a fusion power device known as the Thermotron. The concept was invented by Austrian {{scientist}} Ronald Richter, {{who claimed to have}} a design that would produce effectively unlimited power.|$|R
50|$|The Argentine {{government}} {{requested that}} he return to Argentina in 1952, {{a few months}} before the expiration of his scholarship, to serve in the scientific review panel of the <b>Huemul</b> Project, a study on nuclear fusion conducted by Ronald Richter. Balseiro's report and those of other members of the panel finally convinced the government that the <b>Huemul</b> Project had no scientific merit. Based on this, and reports from a second review panel (composed of physicists Richard Gans and Antonio Rodríguez), the <b>Huemul</b> Project was abandoned.|$|R
50|$|In 1955, José Antonio Balseiro, a {{research}} scientist {{and member of the}} first review panel on the <b>Huemul</b> Project, took over the recently created Instituto de Física de Bariloche, now Instituto Balseiro, which used Richter's facilities in the mainland, but abandoned the buildings in <b>Huemul</b> Island.|$|R

40|$|The <b>huemul</b> (Hippocamelus bisulcus) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{endangered}} and less known neotropical deer. We evaluated its diet in Los Alerces National Park, Argentina. Botanical composition of the diet was studied seasonally using microhistological analysis of fecal samples. Twenty six of the 72 available plant species were recorded in the <b>huemul</b> diet. The annual diet was largely dominated by shrubs (mean + SE= 64. 7 + 2. 4 %) and trees (28. 1 + 2. 4 %). Forbs and grasses only represented 4. 6 + 1. 1 % and 2. 5 + 0. 6 %. The <b>huemul</b> predominantly fed on Nothofagus sp., Maytenus sp., Embothrium coccineum, Schinus patagonicus and Gaultheria mucronata. Diet composition changed significantly between warm-growing and cold-dormant periods. The annual niche breadth was low, indicating a diet concentrated on few species.

50|$|Conservación Patagónica’s {{large-scale}} ecosystem restoration work {{serves as}} the foundation for targeted species-specific programs, such as the effort to monitor and protect the endangered and emblematic <b>huemul</b> deer. As wildness returns to this vast area, the populations of keystone species are finding a new equilibrium. With livestock gone, grasslands are producing more and better quality food for a range of herbivores, which have access to prime habitat and can roam freely without fences. Wildlife recovery programs take this ecosystem-level transition as the jumping-off point for initiatives to protect keystone species. The <b>huemul</b> deer represents the top priority for the Patagonia National Park project: habitat loss, disease transmitted from livestock, hunting, and predation by domestic dogs have diminished its population to 1,500 individuals left on Earth. Tracking pumas with GPS collars uncovers new information about their predation patterns, home ranges, and movements—critical data given their proximity to the <b>huemul</b> deer population. Simultaneously, Conservación Patagónica is developing strategies, such as livestock guardian dogs, to mitigate predator-livestock conflicts.|$|R
50|$|Lake Nahuel Huapi is {{the largest}} and deepest clear water lake in the lake {{district}} of Argentina, with a depth of 425 m. Located {{at the foot of}} the Andes Mountains at an altitude of 767 m, it measures 544 km2. The lake was discovered by the Jesuit priest Nicolás Mascardi in 1670 who also built a chapel on the <b>Huemul</b> Peninsula of the lake. The lake extends 100 km across the border with Chile, and includes many fjords and the Valdivian temperate rain forest. The southern shore of the lake has many hotels and restaurant catering to the tourist industry. The Quetrihué Peninsula in the north of the lake has been set aside as a separate national park, Los Arrayanes National Park. The lake has many islands. The Forest Research station is located on one of them, Victoria Island, which is a natural reserve approachable by boats. <b>Huemul</b> Island hosted the <b>Huemul</b> Project, the Argentinean secret research project on nuclear fusion in 1949-1952.|$|R

30|$|Records of {{presence}} of <b>huemul</b> {{were based on}} database of Administración de Parques Nacionales (APN) of Argentina surveyed during different studies (Vila et al. 2006; Flueck and Smith-Flueck 2011), including the location (latitude and longitude) of each direct sight of individuals or indirect (antlers, bones, feces, or foot prints) records (since 1997). These records were integrated into a geographical information system (GIS) using ArcMap 10.0 software (ESRI 2011). We determined the percentage of observations according to (i) ecosystem types (forests and open lands), (ii) forest types (Nothofagus pumilio, N. antarctica, or mixed evergreen forests), (iii) the difference between percentage of <b>huemul</b> field observations in each forest type {{and the percentage of}} each forest type area of Santa Cruz province, (iv) field observation distances of <b>huemul</b> from the forest edge (inside and outside the forests) expressed as the percentage of the total data, and (v) the difference between percentage of total field observations at each elevation and the percentage of field observations in each ecosystem type (forests and open lands).|$|R
