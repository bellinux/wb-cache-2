5|$|Some bathhouses have areas {{designed}} to facilitate impersonal sex. These areasrooms or hallwaysare illuminated {{only by a}} (dim) red exit sign. It is possible to <b>have</b> <b>sex,</b> but not to see with whom. Other bathhouses, such as the Continental Baths in New York or the Club Baths in Washington, D.C., have two or more bunkbeds in close proximity, in a public area. This provides a place to <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated exhibitionism and voyeurism for those so inclined. Baths often have a (porn) TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms.|$|E

50|$|A {{heterosexual}} threesome {{may involve}} {{two men and}} a woman, or one man and two women - that is, two men <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> with a woman (for example, in double penetration), or two women with a man. A bisexual threesome may involve a man <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> with {{a man and a}} woman, the woman <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> with a man and a woman, or all three <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> with each other. A homosexual threesome would involve either three men or three women.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} done to compare risk factors for HIV/STDs in women who {{reported}} <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with {{both men and women}} and women who reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with men only. METHODS: Female participants in a multisite, randomized HIV/STD prevention study in the Seattle area reported both <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with a man in the 3 months before and having at least 1 risk factor for HIV/STDs during the year before the study. Of these women, 38 % who reported ever <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with a woman were compared with those who reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with men only. RESULTS: Women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with both men and women were more likely than women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with men only to report drug use in the 3 months before the study, a greater lifetime number of male partners, a <b>sex</b> partner who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with a prostitute, an earlier age at sexual debut, and forced sexual contact (P <. 01 for all comparisons). Women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with both men and women had a mean of 3. 2 of these 5 risk factors, vs 2. 1 among women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with men only (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: Women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with both men and women were more likely than women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with men only to engage in multiple risk behaviors. Health workers should be aware of bisexual experience among women, since this may be a marker for multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STDs...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{explored}} people's perceptions {{of how they}} would feel if their partners cheated on them by <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> with their relatives, such as if a man's wife <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with his brother. Kin selection theory suggests that in such situations, victims of infidelity might feel slightly better if their partners <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with biological relatives (compared to sex with nonrelatives) {{because some of the}} victims' genes could still get passed on through their relatives. In two experiments, participants reported how they would feel in various scenarios involving their partners <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> with participants' relatives and nonrelatives. As expected, participants generally reported being very disapproving of a partner's hypothetical infidelity with both their relatives and nonrelatives. However, contrary to predictions generated by kin selection theory, participants tended to report that they would feel worse if their partners <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> with their relatives. We propose several explanations for the current findings and discuss their implications for kin selection theory...|$|R
