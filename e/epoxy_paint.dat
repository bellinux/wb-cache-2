To further evaluate the association of workplace exposure to <b>epoxy</b> <b>paints</b> and respiratory dysfunction, the cross workshift changes in pulmonary function and symptoms of 32 shipyard painters exposed to <b>epoxy</b> <b>paints</b> were compared with 28 shipyard painters not exposed to <b>epoxy</b> <b>paints.</b> The prevalence of lower respiratory tract symptoms was significantly higher among painters exposed to <b>epoxy</b> <b>paints</b> compared with controls. Among exposed painters the mean cross workshift change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) (- 3. 4 %) was greater than the decrement in the non-exposed group (- 1. 4 %). A significant linear relation was seen between % decrement in FEV 1 and hours of exposure to <b>epoxy</b> <b>paints.</b> This study suggests that epoxy resin coatings as used by shipyard painters are associated with increased lower respiratory tract symptoms and acute decrements in FEV 1.

In {{order to}} solve the {{problems}} of the pavement delamination or slip caused by the failures of waterproof adhesive layer or anti-corrosion coating, the <b>epoxy</b> zinc-rich <b>paint,</b> the <b>epoxy</b> clear water <b>paint</b> and <b>epoxy</b> asphalt adhesive material with good performance was selected for the roughness-adhesive force test, tensile test under different temperatures and corrosion resistance test. The optimal anti-corrosion layer and adhesive layer were selected to increase the service life of the steel deck pavement. The test results show that: When the steel roughness is 60 µm, the anti-corrosion material has the highest adhesive strength with the steel plate. Both the <b>epoxy</b> zinc-rich <b>paint</b> and the <b>epoxy</b> water <b>paint</b> have high adhesive strengths with the steel plate at room temperature. But at low temperature, the adhesion performance of the <b>epoxy</b> water <b>paint</b> is significantly better than that of the <b>epoxy</b> zinc-rich <b>paint.</b> At 70 °C, the adhesive strengths of both the <b>epoxy</b> water <b>paint</b> and <b>epoxy</b> zinc-rich <b>paint</b> adhesive system greatly decrease.

A secondary system could be used to pump water below the waterline between hull and ice floes. Two air bubbler systems were fitted: one in the bow to lubricate the hull and another in the stern to prevent ice from entering the nozzles.

40|$|Nowadays, it is consensual {{that the}} biggest {{degradation}} of concrete happens from outside to inside actions, due to the penetration of moisture, active gases and aggressive ions, by mechanical, physical and chemical causes that frequently act together. A low porosity, permeability and concrete penetration to moisture and gases are the first lines of defence against several deterioration mechanisms. The durability of concrete depends largely on how hard or easy fluids (water, carbon dioxide, oxygen) in liquid or gas form can migrate through the concrete hardened mass. When selecting the paint coating for concrete protection, importance {{is given to the}} properties of diffusion and permeability resistance, besides the properties of durability and chemical resistance. The paint coatings must stop the penetration of water and delay the influence of aggressive agents (CO 2, SO 2, Cl- ions), allowing the structure to breathe by a water vapour diffusion mechanism. Through tests of capillarity absorption, immersion absorption, porosity, water and oxygen permeability, a comparison was made between painted and non painted concrete specimens. Three different coating types were tested: silicon varnish; acrylic and <b>epoxy</b> <b>paints.</b> The results showed that, in general, all coatings reduce the porosity and the permeability.
