60|$|<b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>add</b> {{that on the}} morrow I {{found out}} that, after all, there was nothing serious the matter with my ox.|$|E
6000|$|I have {{mentioned}} that my obliging friend the amoureux-fou handed {{me over to}} the doorkeeper of the citadel. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>add</b> that I was at first committed ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Alack-a day!" [...] replied Ganlesse. [...] "Heaven forbid <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>add</b> {{to such a}} calamity! To stable, then, and see we how our steeds {{eat their}} provender, while ours is getting ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I do {{not mean}} to make accusations, Ferdinand. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> only <b>add</b> to our miseries by that. We should be happier apart." ...|$|R
60|$|P.S. - <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>added</b> that <b>I</b> have perfect {{evidence}} {{before me}} that (for some obscure reason) Stevenson was a favourite alias with the M'Gregors.|$|R
60|$|Señor Ortega gulped {{down some}} more wine and {{suggested}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> tell him who I was. “It’s only right <b>I</b> <b>should</b> know,” he <b>added.</b>|$|R
60|$|As a whole they will, I hope, {{take the}} reader forward, {{even if not}} far, rather than backward. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>add</b> that some lines in the early-dated poems have been rewritten, though they have been left {{substantially}} unchanged.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{suffered}} much {{on account}} of him; though <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>add</b> {{that he could not}} altogether be blamed for what had happened. At last the obstacle which separated them was providentially removed; and he came to marry her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Instead of answering, {{he gently}} lifted a long lock of my hair, which hung {{at the side}} of my neck. (My head, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>add,</b> had been dressed that evening on the old-fashioned plan, by my aunt's maid--to please my aunt.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God forbid <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say so! <b>I</b> {{know nothing}} of the youth but what is honourable and open. Honourable and open, said <b>I?</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>added,</b> free, generous, noble. But {{he is still a}} Ravenswood, and may bide his time. Remember the fate of Sir George Lockhart." ...|$|R
60|$|If I tried {{conclusions}} with him, I {{could break}} him in two notwithstanding his staff. But there would remain {{the girl to}} give the alarm, and when to dishonesty <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>added</b> violence, my case would be that of any common bandit.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think my}} debt to Mr. Hart was put down as £3,250," [...] he wrote, [...] "but <b>I</b> believe <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>added</b> another £350 for a {{transaction}} {{as to which}} I fancy he does not hold my note of hand. But the money is due." ...|$|R
6000|$|By the way, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>add</b> that in {{this matter}} also Mavovo's [...] "Snake" [...] did not lie. He had said that six of his company would be killed upon our expedition, and six were killed, neither more nor less.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, nor to {{any other}} {{reasonable}} man; and <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>add,</b> though perhaps you might not allow it, that so long as a man keeps within his means, {{he has a right}} to enhance his excitement and amusement by bets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not believe}} in flattery," [...] he said, [...] "but I think <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>add</b> to the {{qualifications}} personality and a sense of humour. I am quite sure I could never live with a woman--who didn't have a sense of humour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monday, December 1st.--The {{last month}} of the {{worn-out}} old year 1851! If I allowed myself to look back, what a miserable year <b>I</b> <b>should</b> see <b>added</b> {{to all the other}} miserable years that are gone! But I have made my resolution to look forward only, and I mean to keep it.|$|R
6000|$|... 42, 43. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>added,</b> {{that the}} number of the {{segments}} in the [...] cirri increases with the age of the specimen; but that the [...] relative numbers in the different cirri keep, as far as I have [...] seen, nearly constant; hence the numbers are often given in [...] the descriptions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I won't finish it. But, Uncle, I don't see why <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not," [...] <b>added</b> Rose wistfully, for she {{had reached}} {{the heart of the}} romance and found it wonderfully fascinating.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, I am not wanted. In fact, I {{do not see}} how you can be required, but {{anything}} will serve as an excuse. In justice, however, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>add</b> that our friends at the Terrace are disposed to think well of the younger part of the family.' ...|$|E
60|$|Contemplating him I shivered {{a little}} and felt thankful that he was dead. For {{to tell the truth}} I was afraid of that awesome countenance which, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>add,</b> was of the {{whiteness}} of paper, although the cheeks still showed tinges of colour, so perfect was the preservation of the corpse.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{authority}} is Lord Worthington, {{and a number}} of newspaper reports which he showed me. Byron himself will probably be proud to give you the fullest confirmation of the record. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>add,</b> in justice to him, that he is looked upon as a model--to pugilists--of temperance and general good conduct." ...|$|E
6000|$|Speaking of the London Olaf Churches, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>added</b> {{that from}} one of these the thrice-famous Tooley Street gets its name,--where those Three Tailors, {{addressing}} Parliament and the Universe, sublimely styled themselves, [...] "We, the People of England." [...] Saint Olave Street, Saint Oley Street, Stooley Street, Tooley Street; such are the metamorphoses of human fame in the world! ...|$|R
6000|$|... [ex] [...] ---- so I had [...] Him borne, as soon's I could, {{up several}} pair [...] Of stairs--and looked to,----But why <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>add</b> [...] More circumstances?----.--[MS.] ...|$|R
60|$|When {{you have}} got your large edition with its {{correspondence}} into form, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like to read the sheets as they are issued, and put merely letters of reference, a, b, and c, to be taken up in a short epilogue. But I don't want to do or say anything till you have all in perfect readiness for publication. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> merely <b>add</b> my reference letters in the margin, and the shortest possible notes at the end.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>add,</b> perhaps, {{that where}} {{authorities}} differ as to motives, {{where there is}} a conflict of evidence as to the facts themselves, or where the facts admit of more than one interpretation, I have permitted myself to be selective, and confined myself to a point of view adopted at the outset.|$|E
6000|$|... 'At {{this time}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>add</b> {{that he used}} {{from time to time}} to have other boys with him to school, and {{particularly}} Solomon Islanders, whose languages he alone could generally speak. He had also a good deal with him the second set of eight Banks Islanders, who were by this time recognised Catechumens.|$|E
60|$|In short, {{they were}} {{imposing}} persons, {{quite different from}} ordinary Central African natives, though {{there was something about}} their appearance which chilled and repelled me. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>add</b> that their spears had been left outside, and that they saluted the king by folding their arms upon their breasts and bowing in a dignified fashion.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>added,</b> that we careened {{and cleaned}} our ships here, and put {{ourselves}} into a posture for whatever adventures might happen; for as I resolved upon a trading voyage upon {{the coast of}} Chili and Peru, and a cruising voyage also, as it might happen, so I resolved also to put our ships into a condition for both, as occasion should present.|$|R
6000|$|... "It does," [...] Cathro admitted, grimly, [...] "but if {{what you}} wanted was a written {{certificate}} of character <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like to <b>add</b> this, that never did any boy sit on my forms whom I had such a pleasure in thrashing." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked by}} John Hawkins, the web {{manager of a}} right-wing blog, through a pre-written set of {{interview}} questions if she regretted the statement, Coulter replied by saying, [...] "Of course I regret it. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>added,</b> after everyone had left the building except the editors and reporters." [...] Lee Salem, the president of Universal Press Syndicate, which distributes Coulters column, later defended Coulter by characterizing her comments as satire.|$|R
60|$|Here <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>add</b> that, {{although}} {{there are two other}} roads to the plains--that by which, in order to outflank the Fung, the camels were let down when I started on my embassy to Egypt, and that to the north where the great swamps lie--these are both of them equally, if not more, impassable, at any rate to an enemy attacking from below.|$|E
6000|$|When I {{returned}} to the breakfast-room her face was as much discomposed as ever. Without speaking a word she handed me two sealed letters: one, a note to be left for Mr. Meeke at the parsonage; the other, a letter marked [...] "Immediate," [...] and addressed to her solicitor in London, who was also, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>add,</b> her nearest living relative.|$|E
6000|$|... "And in case <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>add</b> {{no further}} words to this, let me {{conclude}} by telling my dear, dear mother that my whole soul and spirit are asking her forgiveness, and by sending my love to my brothers, and sister, whom I love far {{better now than}} ever I did when I was with them. And to Elvira too—-perhaps she is my sister by this time.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>should</b> perhaps <b>add</b> that, while I have included, {{amongst the}} illustrative notes, {{extracts}} from Henry Crabb Robinson's 'Diary', etc., {{many of them}} are now published for the first time. These voluminous MSS. of Robinson's have been re-examined with care; and the reader who compares the three volumes of the 'Diary', etc.--edited by Dr. Sadler--with the extracts now printed from the original MS., will see where sentences omitted by the original editor have been included.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{week since}} the General died, {{circumstances}} {{connected with the}} burial expenses informed the Consul {{that he had taken}} refuge from his creditors, not in Paris as we supposed, but in London. The address is, Number 10, Camp's Hill, Islington. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> also <b>add</b> that the General, for obvious reasons, lived in London under the assumed name of Marillac. It will be necessary, therefore, to inquire for his widow by the name of Madame Marillac.|$|R
40|$|AbstractActivities of alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase in the livers of two {{patients}} with primary hyperoxaluria type I were substantially {{lower than those}} found in five control human livers. Detailed subcellular fractionation {{of one of the}} hyperoxaluric livers, compared with a control liver, showed that there was a complete absence of peroxisomal alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase. This enzyme deficiency explains most of the biochemical characteristics of the disease and means that primary hyperoxaluria type <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be <b>added</b> to the rather select list of peroxisomal disorders...|$|R
