Matching grants covering 90% of infrastructure development were allocated to local communities, {{which led to a}} dramatic {{increase in the number of}} public swimming pools and other facilities of consumptive infrastructure throughout West Germany. The federal crime-fighting apparatus was also modernised, while a Foreign Tax Act was passed which limited the possibility of tax evasion. In addition, efforts were made to improve the railways and motorways. In 1971, a law was passed setting the maximum lead content at 0.4 grams per liter of gasoline, and in 1972 DDT was banned. The Federal <b>Immissions</b> Control Law, passed in March 1974, provided protection from noxious gases, noise, and air-borne particulate matter.|$|E

The upper part houses the central axis of the campus towards Frohburgstrasse, where among others a restaurant, a wide meadow, and a scenic outpost overlooking the Limmat Valley are located. The then-new type of integration of gaming activities, a jogging facility, natural playgrounds and fireplaces in the natural areas of the park harbored a certain risk, but were solved within the 1990s. The park was created as a natural landscape park including approximately 32 ha, being the most recent spacious park in Switzerland, and serving to the public and to the members of the university as a recreation area. Sized to its wide area of hills that protect the park on the streets <b>immissions,</b> the topography creates differentiated landscapes. The individual institute buildings are grouped in the upper park part on both sides of a central pedestrian axis, that is separated by green courtyards. The outer courtyards are interlocked with the surrounding parkland, which are characterized mainly by two reconstructed streams and the observation point on the excavation of the university buildings. The park is free of individual traffic, and the tapping is done entirely underground on both sides of the Winterthurerstrasse. A wide green bridge connects the upper to the lower part of the park and ends in a large staircase made of granite. The lower part of the park is dominated by a large artificial lake and non-urban-like meadows.|$|E

The Law envisages that a lawsuit may be filed to prevent disturbances. Moreover, {{there is also}} the option to seek the compensation of incurred damages. The lawsuit for removal of neighboring <b>immissions</b> differs from the one for obstruction of possession, since it doesn't require establishment of the most recent status of possession, and since there is no deprivation of possession in fact. Neighboring <b>immissions</b> result in disturbance of possession, wherefore the lawsuit on neighboring <b>immissions</b> boils down to evidencing of environmental infringements of neighboring property's space - e. g. soil, air - set forth by the law. Disturbance of possession through illicit influencing of a property, whereupon such property does not change its holder, represents also a form of trespassing, which may be subject to a separate lawsuit.

30|$|Noteworthy is the {{differential}} development of bark pH in Wetzlar and Giessen. In Wetzlar in 1985, the acidification of all tree species {{was significantly lower}} than in Giessen, despite the comparable SO 2 <b>immissions</b> in both towns. This phenomenon {{can be explained by}} a peculiarity pollution situation in Wetzlar. In addition to the acidic <b>immissions,</b> there were lime dust-emitting sources in the north of Wetzlar. In 1970, their basic dusts neutralized the acidic emissions partly leading to a reduced acidification of the local tree bark. Thus, it was not surprising that the first neutrophytic lichens (e.g., Physcia tenella[3]) were found in the north-east of Wetzlar, in the lee of the sources.|$|E

40|$|This keynote {{introduces}} various {{contributions to}} a structured session on sound quality {{organized by the}} present author. In the last decade, basic research as well as practical applications of sound quality increased substantially. This holds true for sound quality of emissions e. g. in product sound {{as well as for}} sound quality of <b>immissions</b> e. g. in the environment. For product sound, two cases of sound quality are considered: one, where sound quality is the dominant, generic feature of a product like musical instruments or loudspeakers, and a second, where sound quality is a by-product like the sound of Dieselengines or- to give a more exotic example- the sound quality of snoring. As concerns sound <b>immissions,</b> wanted sounds typical for a soundscape and unwanted sounds typical for noise <b>immissions</b> can be distinguished. However, also sounds blending perfectly into a soundscape like the noise of a chain saw in the soundscape of a forest, may be pretty annoying. For both product sound and sound quality of the environment, influences of the meaning of sounds have to be considered. Additional extra-aural effects like the image of brand names or audio-visual interactions can significantly influence sound quality judgements. ...|$|E

40|$|Wind turbine (WT) sound annoys {{some people}} {{even though the}} sound levels are {{relatively}} low. This could be because of the amplitude modulated “swishing” characteristic of the turbine sound,which is not taken into account by standard procedures for measuring average sound levels. Studies of sound <b>immission</b> from WTs were conducted continually between 19 August 2011 and 19 August 2012 at two sites in Sweden. A method for quantifying the degree and strength of amplitude modulation (AM) is introduced here. The method reveals that AM at the <b>immission</b> points occur under specific meteorological conditions. For WT sound <b>immission,</b> the wind direction and sound speed gradient are crucial for the occurrence of AM. Interference between two or more WTs could probably enhance AM.

40|$|In {{a problem}} {{analysis}} issues of characterizing and regulating industrial noise are investigated. The {{focus is on}} 'qualitative' features of noise situations and their treatment in the regulation 'TA Laerm'.

The results show that noisiness factors such as impulse and tone characteristics, low frequency noise, information content, 'conspicuousness' of the sound, unfamiliarity and newness, perceived avoidability and <b>immissions</b> in times when quietness is particularly demanded are very relevant for noise evaluation but difficult to administrate. In consequence, some changes or specifications of noise regulations such as the 'TA Laerm' are recommended, including an explicit 'Malus' for specific tone, impulse and content attributes, distinct standards for daytime, evening (plus sunday) and night, and higher demands on noise prevention.

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported here}} {{is aimed at}} improving {{the knowledge of the}} mobility of the heavy metals cadmium and zinc in vulnerable soil types. We use the term vulnerable with reference to vulnerability of groundwater for contamination by soil leaching. At diffuse soil <b>immissions</b> of heavy metals, accumulation is often supposed to occur mainly in the topsoil. Binding of heavy metals in this soil compartment is relatively strong, because of de presence of soil organic matter, clay-minerals and sesquioxides. If soil contains little organic matter and no clay minerals a reduced accumulation in the topsoil and an increased leaching of heavy metals to the groundwater is expected. Also the pH of the soil is of influence on this leaching. Cadmium contamination of the environment has drawn attention since the sixties. The most important occasion was an environmental calamity in Japan where rice paddy was irrigated by cadmium contaminated river water. The pollution was originated from an upstream situated mine. Also in the Netherlands concern exists about pollution of the environment by cadmium.

In 2004, more than 30 % of the population in the Federal State of Baden-Württemberg felt annoyed by traffic noise and almost 20 % by aircraft noise. Noise emitted from industrial plants and leisure time facilities must still be added to these noise sources. So far, the individual types of noise sources were considered separately. Requirements, calculation and measurement methods are available for the respective types of noise. The impact of the individual types of noise, however, cannot be taken into consideration separately but must be integrally assessed as a totality of noise sources.
