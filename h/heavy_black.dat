5|$|One of {{the newest}} traditions on the UCF campus {{pertains}} to the Pegasus seal {{in the center of}} the main floor of the Student Union. From their first day on campus for orientation, new students are told to never walk on the Pegasus. As the tradition is told, those who step on the seal will never graduate from UCF. Usually the seal is roped off with <b>heavy</b> <b>black</b> velvet ropes, but when the ropes are not in place, students can be seen carefully avoiding the seal. In 2005, Florida Leader magazine named this new tradition the best college superstition in Florida.|$|E

5|$|First {{appearing}} in Dead 'Ard and Warrior, The Black Currant returned {{in a series}} of White Dwarf Thrud strips titled Thrud the Destroyer. In this story, The Black Currant is the leader of a horde of warriors who attack a small village, looting the homes, burning the women, raping the livestock and eating the babies. The Black Currant returned again in issue 3 of Critchlow's self-published Thrud the Barbarian comic as the leader of a group of bandits laying siege to a small town. The Black Currant is depicted in <b>heavy</b> <b>black</b> armour, wearing a helmet provided with a pair of exceedingly long, horizontally extending horns.|$|E
5|$|Production on {{the film}} was {{temporarily}} shut down after a fire destroyed several soundstages at Paramount Studios, {{one of which was}} adjacent to the set for the Genesis planet. Initially, the set's pyrotechnics were suspected of causing the fire, but the cause was ruled to be arson. Shatner was among the cast members who grabbed fire hoses to stop the flames. Correll hoped the place would burn down so that he would get his chance to film in Hawaii. While most of the set was undamaged, holes {{in the side of the}} building had to be covered with <b>heavy</b> <b>black</b> curtains to prevent outside light from leaking in.|$|E

25|$|Lagden's bushshrike is {{a stocky}} bird some 23cm long with a <b>heavy</b> <b>black</b> bill. The adult {{male and female}} are similar in plumage. The upper parts, {{including}} the wings and tail, are olive-green, and the head is dark grey. The underparts are yellow, sometimes tinged orange on the breast. The tail is edged with yellow. The legs are bluish grey.|$|E
25|$|Heavy oil and bitumen, {{which have}} far more carbon than hydrogen, are <b>heavy,</b> <b>black,</b> sticky and either slow-pouring or so close to being solid {{that they will not}} pour at all unless heated. Although the {{dividing}} line is fuzzy, the term heavy oil refers to slow-pouring heavy hydrocarbon mixtures. Bitumen refers to mixtures with the consistency of cold molasses that pour at room temperatures with agonizing slowness. Oils with high viscosity and heavy gravity do not float on water, but sink.|$|E
50|$|Snake Nation was a band {{consisting}} of Corrosion of Conformity members Mike Dean and Woody Weatherman, along with comic artist Brian Walsby on drums. While C.O.C. was on hiatus in 1989, Snake Nation released one album on Caroline Records. The music was {{a blend of}} the aggressive hardcore of Animosity-era C.O.C. with a slower, <b>heavier</b> <b>Black</b> Sabbath influence. The album features a cover of Blue Cheer's Babylon.|$|R

5000|$|By the 19th century, {{mourning}} behaviour in England {{had developed}} into {{a complex set of}} rules, particularly among the upper classes. For women, the customs involved wearing <b>heavy,</b> concealing, <b>black</b> clothing, and the use of <b>heavy</b> veils of <b>black</b> crêpe. The entire ensemble was colloquially known as [...] "widow's weeds" [...] (from the Old English waed, meaning [...] "garment").|$|R
25|$|This glossy all-black crow has a <b>heavy</b> <b>black</b> {{bill with}} an arching culmen (upper {{edge of the}} mandible) and has a fine tip. The {{feathers}} have a purple gloss throughout. The tail of the Indian jungle crow is rounded and the legs and feet are stout. The Himalayan japonensis (in this sense including western intermedius and eastern tibetosinensis) has a slightly wedge-shaped tail and a voice is a guttural and grating graak (intermedius) or a hoarse kyarrh (tibetosinensis). The calls of the Indian jungle crow are not unlike that of the house crow but are harsher. In Sri Lanka, the house crow lacks the light grey neck but the neck is slimmer than in the jungle crow. The sexes are indistinguishable.|$|E
25|$|The Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (Fall 1945) was a Turing complete, {{general-purpose}} computer that used 17,468 vacuum tubes {{to create the}} circuits. At its core, it {{was a series of}} Pascalines wired together. Its 40 units weighed 30 tons, occupied , and consumed $650 per hour (in 1940s currency) in electricity when idle. It had 20 base-10 accumulators. Programming the ENIAC took up to two months. Three function tables were on wheels and needed to be rolled to fixed function panels. Function tables were connected to function panels using <b>heavy</b> <b>black</b> cables. Each function table had 728 rotating knobs. Programming the ENIAC also involved setting some of the 3,000 switches. Debugging a program took a week. The ENIAC featured parallel operations. Different sets of accumulators could simultaneously work on different algorithms. It used punched card machines for input and output, and it was controlled with a clock signal. It ran for eight years, calculating hydrogen bomb parameters, predicting weather patterns, and producing firing tables to aim artillery guns.|$|E

500|$|My War is {{the second}} studio album by American band Black Flag. [...] It {{polarized}} fans on its release in 1984 on SST Records over the LP's B-side, on which the band slowed down to a <b>heavy,</b> <b>Black</b> Sabbath-esque trudge, despite the reputation the band had earned as leaders in fast hardcore punk on its first album, Damaged (1981).|$|E
500|$|Printed on {{yellowish}} paper, {{each page}} conforms strictly to a rhythmic six-panel grid, {{in contrast to}} the free placement of panels that characterized Brown's autobiographical period. [...] Tone and mood are set by the composition of the panels, as during Riel's trial when all tonal variation is dropped, and the white figures are placed against a <b>heavy</b> <b>black</b> background, which emphasizes the claustrophobic atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} text-driven, with few wordless panels in its 1,500 {{black-and-white}} panels. [...] The art has high contrast, with <b>heavy</b> <b>black</b> areas and thick black borders balanced against areas {{of white and}} wide white margins. [...] There is little gray in the shading. [...] In the narrative present, the pages are arranged in eight-panel grids; in the narrative past, Spiegelman found himself [...] "violating the grid constantly" [...] with his page layouts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the writing}} {{received}} mixed reviews, {{the reception of}} the artwork was almost entirely positive. Higgins, recalling the <b>heavy</b> <b>blacks</b> and bold outlines of the original strip, found Critchlow's new style {{to be much more}} open and expressive. Maxwell also praised Critchlow's development as an artist, judging the comic to be beautifully drawn and coloured with a clear line style. Carter thought that the art was a little flat in places, but nevertheless praised it for being unique with a lot of character.|$|R
5000|$|The {{story was}} an {{influence}} on Alan Moore when creating Watchmen. Moore has said, [...] "We wanted to take Superduperman 180 degrees - dramatic, instead of comedic," [...] but it also influenced the art: [...] "I think that we probably settled upon the kind of Wally Wood 'Superduperman' style. You know, super-heroics, lots of details, <b>heavy</b> <b>blacks,</b> of a distinctive style." [...] When asked {{about the influence of}} Superfolks on his work like the earlier Marvelman, Moore said, [...] "I’d still say that Harvey Kurtzman’s Superduperman probably had the preliminary influence." [...] He went into more detail in Kimota! the Miracleman Companion: ...|$|R

500|$|Scholar Ruth K. MacDonald {{argues that}} {{the black and white}} {{illustrations}} emphasize the mythic, permanent quality of the tale with <b>heavy</b> <b>black</b> lines that display little of the delicacy characteristic of Potter's work. [...] She suggests these pictures are more like woodcuts in their heaviness than drawings, and points out they were not [...] "tossed off" [...] to satisfy fans and her publisher, but deliberately planned to give an antique, primitive quality to the story in the manner of Caxton's woodcuts for his edition of Aesop's Fables.|$|E
500|$|She {{notes that}} the colour {{illustrations}} are not vignetted nor surrounded with <b>heavy</b> <b>black</b> lines but rather with a white border that prevents the pastels from fading into the background. The lightness of the pastels and the overall green tones of the colour illustrations contrast with the heavy lines of {{the black and white}} pictures and the blocks of print, and this contrast produces a sense of fading because of antiquity yet suggest permanence, [...] "as the greenness of nature is permanent and recurring in the cycle of seasons." ...|$|E
500|$|During the Who's That Girl World Tour of 1987, Madonna {{performed}} it in {{a medley}} with [...] "Material Girl" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin". She wore an elaborate costume, inspired by Dame Edna Everage. It {{consisted of a}} hat strewn with fake fruits, flowers and feathers, jeweled batwing spectacles with <b>heavy,</b> <b>black</b> frames, a ruffled skirt and a bodice covered with objects such as watches and dolls and fishnets. Author Carol Clerk stated that the dress was more [...] "ludicrous for Madonna, than humorous." [...] Two different performances of the song on this tour {{can be found on}} the videos: Who's That Girl: Live in Japan, filmed in Tokyo, Japan, on June 22, 1987, and , filmed in Turin, Italy, on September 4, 1987.|$|E

5000|$|Qadri’s {{works are}} largely {{monochromatic}} surfaces which he penetrates with punctures and serrations. The Buddhist scholar Robert Thurman has described his dots and striations as [...] "lustrous bubbles of energy." [...] Qadri transforms paper with these markings making {{it into a}} three-dimensional surface. Despite {{the fact that he}} lives in Northern Europe, a sense of Indian ethos pervades his art. His colors are luminous—Sindoori reds, peacock blues, intense oranges, even <b>heavy</b> <b>blacks</b> and grays—and distinctly Indian. Colors fade and seep through the paper. The vibrations created by the colors are endless and break the boundary between the inner space of the image and the external space of the viewer.|$|R
