40|$|The large {{charging}} times {{required by}} conventional batteries constitute an important limitation in many applications. The use of ultracapacitors as energy storage elements allows substantially faster charging. This paper presents {{a power supply}} system developed in order to validate the possibility of providing a mobile robot platform with an electrical energy storage system based on ultracapacitors and batteries, ensuring both the autonomy and the charging time required by this vehicle. Both simulations results and experimental results – also {{presented in this paper}} – validate this possibility. Using exclusively one ultracapacitors module as <b>energy-storing</b> <b>device</b> of the new power supply system, the mobile platform achieved an autonomy of 22 minutes after a charging time of 1 minute and 57 seconds. The charging time is less than 10 % of the autonomy time. The system also proved its ability to properly charge lead-acid batteries or nickel–metal hydride batteries, which may be used as energy-storing devices, allowing the mobile platform to achieve greater autonomy than the one obtained with ultracapacitors (at the cost of larger charging times).

25|$|Buggy Races – Buggy, officially called Sweepstakes, is a race around Schenley Park. It can {{be thought}} of as a relay race with five runners, using the buggy vehicle as the baton. Entrants submit a small, usually torpedo-shaped, vehicle that is pushed uphill and then allowed to roll downhill. The {{vehicles}} are unpowered, including the prohibition of such <b>energy-storing</b> <b>devices</b> as flywheels. They are, however, steered by a driver who is usually a petite female student lying prone, arms stretched forward to steer via a turning mechanism. Space is so tight inside the buggies that the drivers usually cannot change position beyond turning their heads.|$|R

This growing field of research and applications is currently being supported by numerous governmental and industrial initiatives in the United States, Asia and Europe to overcome grid energy distribution issues. The technology is particularly intended for densely populated areas. It is now being commercialized for power-delivery devices, such as power transmission lines and cables, motors and generators. Applications in electric utilities include current limiters, long transmission lines and energy-storage devices that will help industries avoid dips in electric power.

40|$|An {{engineering}} discipline denoted as {{hybrid power}} management (HPM) {{has emerged from}} continuing efforts to increase energy efficiency and reliability of hybrid power systems. HPM is oriented toward integration of diverse electric energy-generating, <b>energy-storing,</b> and energy-consuming <b>devices</b> in optimal configurations for both terrestrial and outer-space applications. The basic concepts of HPM are potentially applicable at power levels ranging from nanowatts to megawatts. Potential applications include terrestrial power-generation, terrestrial transportation, biotechnology, and outer-space power systems. Instances of this discipline at prior stages of development were reported (though not explicitly labeled as HPM) in three prior NASA Tech Briefs articles: "Ultracapacitors Store Energy in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle"(LEW- 16876), Vol. 24, No. 4 (April 2000), page 63; "Photovoltaic Power Station With Ultracapacitors for Storage" (LEW- 17177), Vol. 27, No. 8 (August 2003), page 38; and "Flasher Powered by Photovoltaic Cells and Ultracapacitors" (LEW- 17246), Vol. 24, No. 10 (October 2003), page 37. As the titles of the cited articles indicate, the use of ultracapacitors as energy-storage devices {{lies at the heart}} of HPM. An ultracapacitor is an electrochemical energy-storage device, but unlike in a conventional rechargeable electrochemical cell or battery, chemical reactions do not take place during operation. Instead, energy is stored electrostatically at an electrode/electrolyte interface. The capacitance per unit volume of an ultracapacitor is much greater than that of a conventional capacitor because its electrodes have much greater surface area per unit volume and the separation between the electrodes is much smaller. Power-control circuits for ultracapacitors can be simpler than those for batteries, for two reasons: (1) Because of the absence of chemical reactions, charge and discharge currents can be greater than those in batteries, limited only by the electrical resistances of conductors; and (2) whereas the charge level of a battery depends on voltage, temperature, age, and load condition, the charge level of an ultracapacitor, like that of a conventional capacitor, depends only on voltage...|$|R
