40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this report}} have been to describe important farming systems in the Central West of NSW, to gain some insights into current financial performance and to examine in more detail the role of pastures in these farming systems {{at a time when}} the profitability of wool growing has been low relative to <b>grain</b> <b>growing.</b> While <b>farms</b> and farming systems vary considerably across the region, a majority can be broadly grouped into a mixed livestock and cropping category. Although there is also significant variability within this category, two representative farms and farming systems were developed for the region with the assistance from a small group of farmers and extension staff from NSW Agriculture. One represents the farms and farming systems east of Condobolin and the other represents the farms and farming systems to the west of Condobolin. Whole-farm budget models have been developed for each to provide a description of the farms in this region and an indication of their current profitability. They are useful to give an indication of how farm income might be altered by the introduction of some new technology, a new enterprise such a pulse crop, or an alternative management practice. This report presents some examples of their application but importantly it has provided a template for the development of additional whole-farm budgets for alternative farming systems in this and other regions. Using the whole-farm budget representing farms east of Condobolin, and a linear programming model, PRISM Condobolin, this report shows that the optimal length of pasture is fairly insensitive to changing market signals for both cropping and livestock commodities. It also shows that although length of pasture is insensitive, the optimal mix of enterprises does change, highlighting the importance of considering the interactions between enterprises in whole-farm analysis.

40|$|Abstract. Under high {{pressure}} {{of more than}} 1 GPa, the <b>grain</b> <b>growing</b> process of Zinc-Aluminium (ZA) alloy is difficult observed by experimental method, therefore numerical simulation method is used to observe <b>grain</b> <b>growing</b> process of ZA alloy. Pressure as a important variable is leading-in thermodynamic parameters of ZA alloy, then solute diffusion and redistribution model, <b>grain</b> nucleating and <b>growing</b> model are present, and dendrite growth module is applied to describe grain growth. The simulation results of grain growth process under {{high pressure}} are demonstrated: In the initially solidification stage, <b>grains</b> are equiaxed <b>growing</b> process, after 15 s solidification time, dendrite arm size are not equal, the reason is there are nonhomogeneous temperature fields around grains, which make some <b>grains</b> appear fast <b>growing</b> velocity, even it can be observed that dendrite arm of different grains are meet each other at 25 s solidification time. Comparing simulated microstructure with experimental microstructure under 2 GPa high pressure, it shows both grain size and grain distribution are similar, proving that the <b>grain</b> <b>growing</b> process can be well observed by simulation method...|$|R

30|$|In {{the theory}} of planet formation, the issue {{concerning}} the radial drift of meter-size dust remains an open question. In a typical scenario, micrometer-size dust <b>grains</b> <b>grow</b> to be kilometer-size planetesimals via collision and merging in a protoplanetary disk (Goldreich and Ward 1973; Hayashi 1981). When the dust <b>grain</b> <b>grows</b> to be meter-sized, there is velocity {{with respect to the}} disk gas and losses in the angular momentum due to the drag force. Thus, the grain falls down to the central star and cannot grow further (Adachi et al. 1976; Brauer et al. 2008).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} farm growth and participation in agri-environmental schemes, using the example of meadow extensification schemes in Switzerland. As a result of small farm sizes in Swiss agriculture, theory would suggest that economies of scale are considerable for market production activities, so that for <b>growing</b> <b>farms</b> it would be rational to intensify. Configural frequency analysis is used to identify and describe combinations of farm size development and proportion of meadows placed under agri-environmental schemes. In the Swiss case, <b>growing</b> <b>farms</b> are likely to reduce their participation, whereas shrinking <b>farms</b> have a <b>growing</b> share of their meadows under extensification schemes.
