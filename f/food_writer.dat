5|$|Nigella Lucy Lawson (born 6 January 1960) is an English journalist, broadcaster, {{television}} personality, gourmet, and <b>food</b> <b>writer.</b> She is {{the daughter}} of Nigel Lawson, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Vanessa (née Salmon) Lawson, whose family owned the J. Lyons and Co. food and catering business. After graduating from Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University, Lawson started work as a book reviewer and restaurant critic, later becoming the deputy literary editor of The Sunday Times in 1986.

In 1998, she brought out her first cookery book, How to Eat, which sold 300,000 copies and became a best-seller.

5|$|The Book of Household Management {{has been}} edited, revised and {{enlarged}} several times since Isabella's death {{and is still}} in print as at 2016. Food writers have stated that the subsequent editions of the work were far removed from and inferior to the original version. Several cookery writers, including Elizabeth David and Clarissa Dickson Wright, have criticised Isabella's work, particularly her use of other people's recipes. Others, such as the <b>food</b> <b>writer</b> Bee Wilson, consider the censure overstated, and that Beeton and her work should be thought extraordinary and admirable. Her name has become associated with knowledge and authority on Victorian cooking and home management, and the Oxford English Dictionary states that by 1891 the term Mrs Beeton had become used as a generic name for a domestic authority. She is also considered a strong influence in the building or shaping of a middle-class identity of the Victorian era.|$|E

Sandy's spicy lamb served on a char grilled vegetable stack proved to the judges she was very accomplished behind the grill, despite her age. The always articulate Katie from Brisbane went for a cheaper option and whipped up some steak fajitas.

40|$|The role of <b>food</b> <b>writers</b> {{has changed}} - {{no longer are}} they {{concerned}} only with recipes and lifestyle issues. Today's <b>food</b> <b>writers</b> are faced with writing on a broad scope of topics that stretch from recipes and restaurant through to health, nutrition, and social and ethical eating issues. This study first outlines the professional role and responsibilities of <b>food</b> <b>writers,</b> and then examines the idea that, in a professional capacity, <b>food</b> <b>writers</b> are journalists. As such, <b>food</b> <b>writers</b> {{are faced with the}} responsibility of acting {{in the best interest of}} the public when they report information on food and food related issues. Yet, unlike their international colleagues, Australian <b>food</b> <b>writers</b> do not have their own code of ethics, although they do have an active professional association, the Food Media Club of Australia. This study identifies the ethical dilemmas faced by the Australian food media, and looks at how they are currently dealing with issues such as accepting junkets, and the idea of food being a subjective topic. It then considers the potential consequences of unethical professional practices by <b>food</b> <b>writers</b> before recommending the development of a professional code of ethics for Australia’s food media. Academic literature on the media and media ethics is considered, although there is little written specifically on the food media itself. Therefore, in order to ascertain specific insight and knowledge as well as some understanding of the current operations of Australia’s food media, interviews with industry professionals and an ethics expert were conducted. Additionally, information was gathered from members of international food media associations. The various interviews revealed a common concern over the lack of information published by the food media on social and ethical food issues such as genetic modification, and sustainable agriculture. Consequently, after examining approaches used by <b>food</b> <b>writers</b> in the United Kingdom to publish such information, recommendations also include a more strident and proactive approach by the Australian food media in order to reach the general public with information that they, the food media, deem important to the future of Australian food.
