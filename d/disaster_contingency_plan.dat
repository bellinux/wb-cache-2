This paper fits in the research area by introducing the development of a software system that facilitates personnel evacuations during an urban storm surge disaster. The system uses a linear programming model and simplex algorithm and is implemented with ArcGIS and C #. Post development experiments have shown it to be efficient in automatically calculating the affected area, the number of personnel to be evacuated and screening the settlement points of safety. In addition, an optimization calculation generates the maximum number of personnel to be allocated to the safety points as well as the best evacuation routes. The system is simple to operate with a high degree of visualization. Index Terms—linear programming, personnel evacuation, <b>contingency</b> <b>plan,</b> storm surge, flood I...|$|R

30|$|We {{use this}} {{conceptual}} framework to reexamine the current <b>disaster</b> preparedness and <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> in Hong Kong. We conclude that current disaster preparedness in Hong Kong is neither place-responsive, nor sufficiently {{attentive to the}} special needs of an ageing population that should be considered as a particularly vulnerable social group. Potential vulnerability is often dismissed by the general public, which tends to develop a very firm, positive opinion on government capability in rescue and restoration. This creates a gap between current government-led disaster preparedness and the expectations of the public. For Hong Kong, the current conventional <b>contingency</b> <b>plan,</b> which perceives the community as a passive recipient of top-down intervention policies, should be modified. Although social capital is a significant resource with which individuals and their families to earn a living, partake in culture, and benefit from social relationships (Bernard et al. 2007), this powerful resource is largely untapped in Hong Kong’s DRR planning. Social capital is a missing link in disaster response, but it can be effective in connecting different stakeholders for integrated and timely action (Nakagawa and Shaw 2004).|$|R
40|$|Background: The Disaster Preparedness Program (DPP) is a {{partnership}} between The Center for Disaster and Humanitarian Assistance Medicine (CDHAM) —a part of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences—and the United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM). The DPP aims to assist African partner nations to enhance their disaster preparedness and response capabilities. The programme takes a whole-of-government approach to disaster preparedness and response, {{with an emphasis on}} plan development and, in some cases, creation of an autonomous national disaster management agency. Methods: The DPP worked with the Embassy and other US government stakeholders to identify key ministries involved in disaster preparedness. With DPP assistance, a technical team from the partner nation undertook a comprehensive assessment of their current disaster response capabilities. This information was used to construct a disaster management strategic work plan that identified specific gaps in disaster preparedness. A disaster simulation exercise was conducted with representatives from agencies and ministries involved in disaster response. They applied their existing structure, plans and resources to a scenario designed for their country by CDHAM in order to identify any additional shortfalls in the plan. The finalised work plan could then be used by the partner nation to prioritise and address immediate needs. Findings: Since 2009, CDHAM has worked with 16 partner nations. Ten countries have developed national pandemic influenza preparedness and response plans. By December, 2014, one country had used this plan {{to prevent the spread of}} Ebola, one country adapted this plan to a whole-of-government Ebola response, and six others are currently in the process of adopting this approach. Eight African armies have drafted “military support to civil authorities” <b>disaster</b> <b>contingency</b> <b>plans,</b> and one army has used this approach with Ebola. Ten countries have developed disaster management strategic work plans and are currently conducting activities in partnership with the US State Partnership Program, USAFRICOM, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the World Bank to fill gaps in their national disaster preparedness.

40|$|At present {{post-disaster}} {{activities and}} plans seem to vary widely. An adequate {{estimation of the}} availability of post-disaster psychosocial services across Europe is needed in order to compare them with recently developed evidence-informed psychosocial care guidelines. Here we report on the results of a cross-sectional web-based survey completed in 2008 by two hundred and eighty-six representatives of organizations involved in psychosocial responses to trauma and disaster from thirty-three different countries across Europe. The survey addressed planning and delivery of psychosocial care after disaster, methods of screening and diagnosis, types of interventions used, and other aspects of psychosocial care after trauma. The findings showed that planning and delivery of psychosocial care was inconsistent across Europe. Countries in East Europe seemed to have less central coordination of the post-disaster psychosocial response and fewer post-disaster guidelines that were integrated into specific <b>disaster</b> or <b>contingency</b> <b>plans.</b> Several forms of psychological debriefing, {{for which there is no}} evidence of efficacy to date, were still used in several areas particularly in North Europe. East European countries delivered evidence-based interventions for PTSD less frequently, whilst in South- and South-Eastern European countries anxiety suppressing medication such as benzodiazepines were prescribed more frequently to disaster victims than in other areas. Countries across Europe are currently providing sub-optimal psychosocial care for disaster victims. This short report shows that there is an urgent need for some countries to abandon non-effective interventions and others to develop more evidence based and effective services to facilitate the care of those involved in future disasters.

40|$|Natural {{disasters}} pose serious {{threats to}} large urban areas, therefore understanding and predicting human movements {{is critical for}} evaluating a population's vulnerability and resilience and developing plans for disaster evacuation, response and relief. However, only limited {{research has been conducted}} into the effect of natural disasters on human mobility. This study examines how natural disasters influence human mobility patterns in urban populations using individuals' movement data collected from Twitter. We selected fifteen destructive cases across five types of natural disaster and analyzed the human movement data before, during, and after each event, comparing the perturbed and steady state movement data. The results suggest that the power-law can describe human mobility in most cases and that human mobility patterns observed in steady states are often correlated with those in perturbed states, highlighting their inherent resilience. However, the quantitative analysis shows that this resilience has its limits and can fail in more powerful natural disasters.

30|$|This study reformulates {{the concept}} and {{contents}} of disaster risk reduction (DRR) in Hong Kong through an explorative study on collaborative place audit (CPA) and social vulnerability index (SVI) for elders. We believe that DRR should be place- and age-responsive. Accordingly, DRR needs to go beyond technical concerns and address vulnerability and risk encountered in the built environment where an individual is located. A place-centered DRR begins with an assessment of person–environment relations from an interdependent perspective. Community becomes a significant scale at which to address vulnerability and risks {{across a range of}} environmental, socioeconomic, and institutional factors. A CPA is a ground-level assessment tool that identifies vulnerability and risk in the built and social environment. The audit encourages collaboration in problem solving that uses social capital to effect decision-making change in hierarchies and policy networks. Age-responsive DRR facilitates distinguishing living-alone elders from the general population. This perspective addresses varying degrees of vulnerability due to social and communicational isolation, poverty, disability, being sent to hospital and/or receiving institutional care, as well as lack of access to primary care. Accordingly, SVI, based on compound indicators, is developed to assess the differentiation of vulnerability across the territory with particular reference to the elders. These two approaches, namely, CPA and SVI, build community capacity to develop a resilient city, as well as to provide evidence-based recommendations that improve government-led <b>disaster</b> preparedness and <b>contingency</b> <b>plans.</b>|$|R

40|$|Any {{information}} technology(IT) {{system needs}} its computing resources to operate correctly (system integrity) and should maintain {{the value of}} its information (data integ-rity). Unfortunately, adverse events may damage data integrity or system integ-rity or both. <b>Contingency</b> <b>planning</b> for IT sys-tems focuses on preserving, enabling recovery, or the graceful degradation of system or data integrity. Unfortunately, contingency mechanisms that work in one adverse situation may be hopelessly inadequate in another. Consequently, different <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> types exist for different “disasters. ” The two pri-mary types are physical and logical event <b>plans.</b> Traditional IT <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> address physical events such as flood, fire, earthquake, war, or loss of power. Many sources discuss traditional con-tingency planning, which often empha-sizes replication and physical separation to guard against physical disasters. Such traditional planning does not consider logical events. A logical event (LE) strikes all sites that have similar information configura-tions (software, data, and firmware) —no matter how widely separated. The im-pacted system also may corrupt IT that is down the information flow stream. LE <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> has two subcat-egories: plans for incompletely under-stood systems and plans for well-under-stood systems. Because the Y 2 K problem is an LE, discussion of LE <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> is appropriate. LE <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> borrows from systems security principles, which include auditing, system modeling, input and output validation, and in-strumentation.
