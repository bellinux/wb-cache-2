2500|$|By 1930, the Ackerman Motor Car Company {{was a local}} Franklin distributor. For 23 years, John Connolly, {{secretary}} and treasurer, was associated with Franklin Automobile Company. In his new capacity, {{he was in charge}} of the service department of the company and under his guidance it was considered by [...] "automotive men" [...] to be one of the most efficiently operated in the country. The Franklin Service Station in Syracuse was thoroughly equipped and employed the most modern machinery and a corps of [...] "factory trained mechanics." [...] The company serviced fully 75 percent of the Franklin cars in the area and they carried a large stock of parts. They also had their own special machinery for such jobs as <b>grinding</b> <b>valves,</b> for searching out grounds and short circuits in the electrical system, and they were equipped for complete overhaul jobs as well as [...] "to effect repairs of every nature." [...] The company advertised that [...] "a road car is available at all times for towing in cars which have been in accidents or have been otherwise disabled." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1924 an {{employee}} demonstrated the K R Wilson Combination Machine. Within three hours he relined the crankshaft bearings, bored them to accurate size and re-bored four cylinders {{to a standard}} Ford size. The work would previously have taken 18 to 20 hours. A special assembly bench by Manley Motor Support assisted with quick and accurate re-assembly. The machinery was claimed to bring factory exactness to the local garage and ensure a full 12,000 miles of running without further attention. Other machinery for the same purpose included the Wright Multi-valve Grinder which <b>grinds</b> 4 <b>valves</b> at once, the Ames Cylinder Gauge, the Wilson Crankcase Aligning Jig and Weaver Axle Stand.|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{determining}} the age of bivalves by <b>grinding</b> off the <b>valves</b> and counting the yearrings in transverse section, developed by Thijssen (1971), was examined and as the results appeared to be reliable, was used in studying some populations of Macoma balthica L. on and near the Balgzand (a tidal flat near Den Helder), from some places in the North Sea near the Dutch Waddensea-islands and near the North Sea coast between Den Helder and IJmuiden...|$|R
5000|$|During 1929 new 6-cylinder engines were introduced. Experience had {{suggested}} operators would prefer the cheaper {{to buy and}} to maintain 4-cylinder engines. The new 6-cylinder engines were bending to the current fashion. A very valuable invention was patented which allowed the lifting of cylinder heads, decarbonising and <b>valve</b> <b>grinding</b> without dismantling the overhead camshaft. At the Annual General Meeting the chairman reported he {{had been asked to}} comment {{on the use of the}} crude oil engine and the chairman could [...] "only assure him that we are fully alive to the possibilities".|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study the wheel/workpiece dynamic {{interactions}} in high-speed grinding using vitrified CBN wheel and DTG (difficult to grind) work materials. This problem is typical in the <b>grinding</b> of engine <b>valve</b> heads. The influence of tangential force per abrasive grain was investigated as an important control variable for the determination of G ratio. Experiments were carried out to observe the influence of vibrations in the wheel wear. The measurements of acoustic emission (AE) and vibration signals helped in identifying {{the correlation between the}} dynamic interactions (produced by forced random excitation) and the wheel wear. The wheel regenerative chatter phenomenon was observed by using the wheel mapping technique. (c) 2008 CIRP...|$|R
500|$|The American Machinist {{reported}} in 1922 that The Churchill Machine Tool Co was [...] "now almost the only specialist in precision grinding machines in Great Britain" [...] {{and that the}} uses of the process in the railway industry {{for the production of}} axle journals were by that time accepted as best practice and that the usage of it for piston rods and cylinders was being established. A summary-box to the article says that: [...] The Carborundum Company and Pratt & Whitney companies are referred to in the article, perhaps demonstrating that Churchill could not operate in isolation despite the [...] "only specialist" [...] status accorded to them early in the article. Supplying grinding machinery to railways, for use in new production and refurbishment of worn mechanisms, became an important new area of operations: post-war government sales of used machinery had flooded the domestic market for machine tools, but exports, initially to Indian railways and then elsewhere, went some way towards softening the blow, and the Churchill companies, whilst scarred, were able to ride out the worst of the post-war recession. Among the more unusual supplies made was a universal grinding machine used to <b>grind</b> the <b>valves</b> of trumpets for the Salvation Army.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental research {{in which the}} thermal damage in inlet engine <b>valves</b> <b>grinding</b> was evaluated. Four different cutting fluids and two grinding wheel were tested and were analyzed the workpiece residual stress, the micro hardness and the optical observation of the workpiece microstructure. The cutting fluid and the grinding wheel types adopted resulted in different types of residual stress. The cutting oil resulted in compressive residual stresses, even using the conventional wheel. The CBN wheel, due to the best proprieties of its grains resulted in compressive residual stresses for all fluids tested by the reducing of the grinding energy and its easier dissipation from the grinding zone. The microstructure investigations showed {{that the source of}} the tensile residual stresses observed was the thermal cycles imposed. No microstructure alterations were detected.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{experimental}} research {{is presented in}} which different types of cutting fluids (a cutting oil and three different types of soluble oils) and grinding wheels (alumina and vitrified CBN) were tested in the inlet engine <b>valves</b> <b>grinding.</b> As evaluation parameters the workpiece residual stress and the grinding wheel wear were analyzed. The cutting fluid and the grinding wheel types adopted resulted in changes in all the parameters, due to the different lubricant abilities among the fluids and due to {{the differences in the}} mechanical and thermal properties among the abrasives tested. For grinding this steel, the CBN wheel is the best choice, mainly due to compressive residual stress results obtained for all cutting fluids tested. The cutting oil is the most adequate cutting fluid to be used, due to its higher lubricity and ability in keeping the wheel sharp for longer periods of time, reducing the overall grinding energy and the thermal damage...|$|R
5000|$|Longevity, as {{demonstrated}} in early automotive applications of the Knight engine. Prior to the advent of leaded gasolines, poppet-valve engines typically required <b>grinding</b> of the <b>valves</b> and valve seats after 20,000 to 30,000 miles (32,000 to 48,000 km) of service. Sleeve valves did not suffer from the wear and recession caused by the repetitive impact of the poppet valve against its seat. Sleeve valves were also subjected to less intense heat build-up than poppet valves, owing to their greater area of contact with other metal surfaces. In the Knight engine, carbon build-up actually helped to improve the sealing of the sleeves, the engines being said to [...] "improve with use", in contrast to poppet valve engines, which lose compression and power as valves, valve stems and guides wear. Due to the continuous motion of the sleeve (Burt-McCollum type), the high wear points linked to poor lubrication in the TDC/BDC (bottom dead centre) of piston travel within the cylinder are suppressed, so rings and cylinders lasted much longer.|$|R

A summary-box to the article says that: [...] In Great Britain the grinding process is now being used extensively on passenger car axles (particularly the journals) passenger railway carriage axle bearing units, crosshead guide bars, links, piston rods, chilled rolls, granite rolls, brass rolls, rubber rolls, paper rolls, crankshafts, camshafts, piston rings, planer knives, ball race rings, aluminium pistons, lenses, plate glass edges, glass tubes. Experiments are being carried out on the grinding of cylinders for locomotive and other engines.

40|$|The {{project has}} been {{focussed}} on ceramic valves for piston engines. That prejudiced nearly all outer conditions, concerning materials, quality, production quantities and costs. Acceptable machining time of less than one minute per piece - as asked for mass production needs - are almost todays standard, when using last generation <b>valve</b> <b>grinding</b> centers, installed {{at some of the}} bigger valve producers now. But for small shops like VEPA, which cannot afford those huge investments, a grinding strategy was developed in interaction with german institutes, by what it is possible to reduce machining time from former three hours to thirty minutes for each valve, without reducing quality and strength standards of the parts. Additionally VEPA developed, designed and produced a fully ceramic sliding bearing by which an older, continuously used grinding machine out of the own machine pool could become improved amazingly.

50|$|The {{cylinder}} head {{intake and exhaust}} ports and intake and exhaust manifolds are shape optimized for better volumetric efficiency. Mitsubishi lowered the friction of the engine by including elastic <b>grinding</b> of the <b>valve</b> stems, adopting a high-efficiency shroud equipped plastic impeller in the water pump and using 0W-20 low-viscosity oil. Mitsubishi increased the combustion efficiency by optimizing {{the design of the}} {{cylinder head}} intake and exhaust ports, by incorporating the MIVEC system on both intake and exhaust valves and by using injectors that give an ultra micro droplet fuel spray. To lower the engine's weight, Mitsubishi used die-cast aluminium for the cylinder block, plastic for the cylinder head cover and intake manifold, and stainless steel for the exhaust manifold. The engine features a compact balancer shaft module with an integrated oil pump. A silent chain is used to drive the camshafts. The compact balancer module, the silent chain, the stable combustion yielded by the intake and exhaust MIVEC system, and high rigidity designs for the cylinder head and cylinder block realize low vibration and noise.|$|R

Nesse artigo é apresentada uma pesquisa experimental sobre os danos térmicos que aparecem nas válvulas de admissão dos motores após passarem pelo processo de retificação. Foram utilizados, nessa experimentação, quatro tipos de fluidos de corte e dois rebolos (CBN e Al 2 O 3), sendo analisadas a tensão residual, a microdureza e a microestrutrura das peças fabricadas com esses materiais. Esses fluidos e rebolos resultaram em diferentes tipos de tensões residuais. O óleo de corte, por exemplo, induziu nas peças tensões residuais de compressão. Em relação ao rebolo de CBN, devido às melhores propriedades de seus grãos abrasivos, estes proporcionaram tensões de compressão para todos os fluidos testados. Em relação às alterações microestruturais, notou-se que nenhuma alteração térmica foi detectada nas peças, embora a inexistência de alterações microestruturais nem sempre sugerem que tensões residuais favoráveis foram obtidas...|$|R
