60|$|Here Bob, who {{had been}} trying {{for some time to}} find a decent excuse for getting away, pretended to see {{something}} of importance {{at the other end of}} the Cob, and trotted off to investigate it, leaving me to <b>finish</b> <b>dressing</b> by myself.|$|E
60|$|Yeobright ran {{upstairs to}} <b>finish</b> <b>dressing</b> himself. While {{he was gone}} another rapping came to the door. This time there was no {{delusion}} {{that it might be}} Eustacia's: the footsteps just preceding it had been heavy and slow. Yeobright thinking it might possibly be Fairway with a note in answer, descended again and opened the door.|$|E
60|$|Charles loudly {{protested that}} {{the charges were}} absurd and preposterous, and would be proved so in no time. He would <b>finish</b> <b>dressing</b> instantly, go to speak to his father, and show him {{the sense of the}} thing. Amy heard and hoped, and his mother, who had great {{confidence}} in his clear sight, was so cheered as almost to expect that today's post might carry a conciliatory letter.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Smike,' said Nicholas {{when the}} first piece was over, and he had almost <b>finished</b> <b>dressing</b> to go home, 'is there any letter yet?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is not <b>finished</b> <b>dressing</b> yet, Master Clinton; {{at least}} he has not {{come out of his}} room. But I expect he is pretty near dressed." ...|$|R
60|$|The two went {{below to}} meet Noel, {{who had just}} <b>finished</b> <b>dressing.</b> They set to work and a smoking hot breakfast was soon on the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad of that," [...] said Sir Thomas, [...] "because {{there will}} be {{something}} for you to live upon. I {{can assure you that}} Captain Batsby will never get a shilling of my money. Now, you had better <b>finish</b> <b>dressing</b> yourself, and come down and eat your dinner with me if you've got any appetite. You will {{have to go back to}} Dover by the boat to-night." ...|$|E
60|$|Fenn made up {{his mind}} swiftly. There was no time to <b>finish</b> <b>dressing.</b> Mr Kay, peering round, might note the absence of the rest of his clothes from their {{accustomed}} pegs if he got into bed as he was. There was only one thing to be done. He threw back the bed-clothes, ruffled the sheets till the bed {{looked as if it had}} been slept in, and opened the door just as Mr Kay reached the threshold.|$|E
60|$|To {{pursue that}} strange hint {{was of course}} the one impulse. The bell had ceased before Frank {{had been able to}} <b>finish</b> <b>dressing,</b> but the house was so far from having wakened to full life, that remembering the {{lateness}} of the breakfast hour, he decided on hastening out to lay his anxious, throbbing feelings before his God, if only to join in the prayer that our desires may be granted as may be most expedient for us.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Geoffrey Saxton, in Alaskan tan and New York evening {{clothes and}} Piccadilly poise, {{was talking to}} the Eugene Gilsons while Claire <b>finished</b> <b>dressing</b> for the theater.|$|R
6000|$|Just as I <b>finished</b> <b>dressing,</b> a tap {{came to the}} door: I said, [...] "Come in," [...] {{expecting the}} chambermaid, whereas a rough man walked in and said,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Wondering {{what could}} be the matter, Tom <b>finished</b> <b>dressing,</b> and in a few minutes {{presented}} himself at the office. President Wallington and Professor Sharp were both waiting for him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's {{all very}} well to say impossible, my dear,' said Lady Monogram; 'but still that's what people are saying. You see Mr Melmotte is a very great man, but perhaps--something else has turned up, so {{that he may be}} thrown over. Things of that kind do happen. You had better <b>finish</b> <b>dressing.</b> I shall. But I shan't make sure of going till I hear that the Emperor is there.' Then she descended to her husband, whom she found forlornly consoling himself with a cigar. 'Damask,' she said, 'you must find out.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{a wonderfully}} {{impractical}} child," [...] she said, deftly assisting Myrtle to <b>finish</b> <b>dressing.</b> [...] "What {{you really need}} is some one to order you around and {{tell you what to}} do. So you must stop thinking about yourself, for a time, and let us do the thinking. Here--sit in this chair by the window. Do you want Mumbles in your lap? All right. Now gaze upon the scenery until I come back. There's a man washing windows across the street; watch and see if he does his work properly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{glad you}} came, Ricky, instead {{of any of}} the others," [...] said the eye. [...] "Light a {{cigarette}} and give it to me. Going to take me to dinner? Fine. Go into the front room till I <b>finish</b> <b>dressing.</b> But don't sit in your usual chair. There's pie in it--Meringue. Kappelman threw it at Reeves last evening while he was reciting. Sophy has just come to straighten up. Is it lit? Thanks. There's Scotch on the mantel--oh, no, it isn't,--that's chartreuse. Ask Sophy to find you some. I won't be long." ...|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{possible}} they <b>finished</b> <b>dressing,</b> while the creaking and swaying continued. Then they rushed {{into the living room}} of the house and found Lady Aurex, fully dressed, awaiting them.|$|R
60|$|I {{had just}} <b>finished</b> <b>dressing</b> {{the wounds of}} a soldier, {{at the end of}} this terrible episode, when a touch on my {{shoulder}} caused me to look up. It was Dobri Petroff.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy had <b>finished</b> <b>dressing,</b> and {{had picked}} up a book to occupy the ten minutes before he would be needed downstairs, when there burst into the room Spike Mullins, {{in a state of}} obvious excitement.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I must {{go upstairs}} {{for a few}} minutes, to <b>finish</b> <b>dressing.</b> When I come down, I'll bring Madeline with me. Do you know, I had a very strange dream last night, which I have not remembered till this instant. I dreamt that it was this morning, and you and I had been talking {{as we have been}} this minute; that I went upstairs, for the very purpose for which I am going now; and that as I {{stretched}} out my hand to take Madeline's, and lead her down, the floor sunk with me, and after falling from such an indescribable and tremendous height as the imagination scarcely conceives, except in dreams, I alighted in a grave.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, {{it will be}} very kind," [...] said Raymond, {{running down}} before her, and meeting Susan {{waddling}} out in a fringe of curl-papers, for some mysterious instinct or echo had conveyed to her and her mistress that there was fire somewhere--perhaps at home. Mrs. Poynsett was not a nervous woman, and from the time she saw her eldest son come in, all fright was over, and she could have borne to hear that the house over her head was burning, in the perfect trust that he would save her from all peril; nor had he any difficulty in committing her to Rosamond, when he hurried away to <b>finish</b> <b>dressing</b> and repair to the spot.|$|E
60|$|Instantly {{there was}} a mad {{scramble}} to <b>finish</b> <b>dressing</b> and when time was up {{it was evident that}} no one proposed to go hungry that Christmas morning. During the meal it was decided that Alec should remain at camp to prepare for the grand feast while the others went in search of rabbits. Walter and Hal, knowing the surrounding country, were to go each on his own hook while Pat would take Sparrer with him. Just before starting the two former held a whispered conference. They had brought in with them a few gifts for Pat and his partner and also some small packages which the home folks had pledged them not to open until Christmas day. At Hal's suggestion it was decided to say nothing about these until night and spring them as a surprise at the Christmas tree on which Hal had set his heart.|$|E
6000|$|Elizabeth had <b>finished</b> <b>dressing,</b> {{a little}} too rapidly, and had gone to find Mrs. Woodbourne. 'Well, Mamma,' said she, {{as soon as she}} came into her room, 'Winifred has lived to say 'the dog is dead'.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Old Mr. Turveydrop is so sorry," [...] said Caddy, [...] "that {{he has not}} <b>finished</b> <b>dressing</b> yet and cannot {{have the}} {{pleasure}} of seeing you before you go. You are such a favourite of his, Esther." ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>finished</b> <b>dress</b> can {{currently}} {{be viewed}} {{on the website}} for this project www.zhibit.org/beautysprivilege. The dress was also recently featured in the April 2011 edition of San Diego Magazine {{in preparation for the}} fashion show in April.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that, Son. Nobody {{is going to}} stand for your tricks much longer. They are getting {{altogether}} too numerous." [...] Tom continued to look as stern as possible. [...] "I've got to take both of you in hand, {{and that is all}} there is to it. You are growing wilder every day. Something has got to be done. Now you go right upstairs and <b>finish</b> <b>dressing,</b> and don't dare to let me hear of any more tricks being played {{for the rest of this}} day, otherwise I'll not only give you a sound thrashing, but I'll cut off your spending money and do several other things that you won't like;" [...] and, thus speaking, the father of the twins opened the door to the hall and shoved them both out towards the stairs with more force than they had felt for some time. The two lads lost no time in retiring to their bedroom.|$|E
50|$|There {{were six}} such courtiers, with a barber and a page, to attend on the King in his bedchamber when he {{arose in the}} morning. They were {{responsible}} for dressing the King in his undergarments before he entered the privy chamber to <b>finish</b> <b>dressing</b> attended by the Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber. While the King ate two Esquires would sit at his feet while at least two served the food, and another served drink in a cup which had been handed {{to him by the}} Chief Butler, and others presented the ewer and basin. At other times the Esquires would be on hand to help the King with menial tasks such as carrying his cloak.|$|E
50|$|Miranda Wells is a nurse {{living in}} a small town. She {{is about to become}} a {{surgical}} nurse and is buying a new house. She's single and her friend sets her up on a blind date with a man named Kevin. On the day of the date, while she's still getting ready, Miranda hears someone outside on the porch. She opens the door and finds someone, who she assumes is Kevin, standing there and invites him in. She offers him lemonade and goes into her bedroom to <b>finish</b> <b>dressing.</b> While she is changing, he notices packing boxes in the house and asks her if she is moving. She replies that she is, and when she comes out of her room she sees he is blocking the door. She starts to feel uneasy and asks him to leave and come back later for their date. He refuses, but she insists that he leave so she can finish getting ready. He walks to the door and locks it. He then attacks and rapes her. Later he is seen running away from the house as someone else comes to the door and knocks. The door is ajar and the man, Kevin, comes in calling out for Miranda. He finds her in the kitchen and calls the police. Miranda is next seen in the hospital, beaten, and having a rape kit and photos taken by the police. The police ask if she had ever seen the man before, and she says that, actually, she had. They promptly go and arrest the rapist, William Finn.|$|E
6000|$|... "By St. Nicholas!" [...] exclaimed Guert, who had now <b>finished</b> <b>dressing,</b> and who {{accompanied}} me {{out into the}} open air, M my poor fellow shall be revenged, if the rifle will do it! Scalped, too, do you say, Corny?" ...|$|R
60|$|Sam {{gazed at}} him, revolted. More than ever {{he began to}} {{understand}} how it was that a girl with ideals had broken off her engagement with this man. He <b>finished</b> <b>dressing,</b> and, after a satisfying breakfast, went on deck.|$|R
60|$|Having <b>finished</b> <b>dressing,</b> {{the boys}} lost {{no time in}} {{following}} Dunston Porter toward the rock which had been {{the goal of the}} swimming race. They found the old hunter and traveler searching through the brushwood back of the rocks.|$|R
60|$|When he <b>finished</b> <b>dressing</b> {{he went to}} {{the little}} dark shop. The shopkeeper was making coffee with a handful of {{charcoal}} on the doorstep, {{for the sake of the}} draught, and took off his hat politely as Kit came up.|$|R
6000|$|Catherine {{thought a}} little. [...] "I don't know how; {{but not in}} that way. I wish {{to be just as}} usual." [...] And she <b>finished</b> <b>dressing,</b> and, {{according}} to her aunt's expression, went plumping down into the paternal presence. She was really too modest for consistent pathos.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the film}} [...] "Auntie Mame," [...] (1958), Brian O'Bannion (Robin Hughes) sings the first couplet of [...] "The Rose of Tralee" [...] as he <b>finishes</b> <b>dressing</b> to escort Mame (Rosalind Russell) {{to a black}} tie event to {{consider}} optioning the film rights of her autobiography to Warner Brothers.|$|R
6000|$|Before breakfast time, just as I had <b>finished</b> <b>dressing</b> {{myself in}} some of the clean things which had been brought from the wagon, Rodd came and made a {{thorough}} and business-like examination of his patient, while I awaited the result with anxiety on the stoep. At length he appeared and said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see anything, and {{the music}} has stopped. I think some elf just came to wake you up, and then flew away; so we won't waste any more time in looking here," [...] said Wee, as she <b>finished</b> <b>dressing</b> Daisy, who flew about like a Will-o'-the-wisp all the while.|$|R
60|$|Scarcely {{knowing whether}} to laugh or cry at Mrs. Brimmer's {{incoherent}} statement, Miss Keene hastily <b>finished</b> <b>dressing</b> {{as the door}} flew open to admit the impulsive Dona Isabel and her sister Juanita. The two Mexican girls threw themselves in Miss Keene's arms, and then suddenly drew back with a movement of bashful and diffident respect.|$|R
