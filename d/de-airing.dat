During heart {{surgeries}} it {{is necessary}} to direct the blood away from the heart and connect the patient to an extra corporeal circulation (ECC) with an associated reservoir (cardiotomy-reservoir). In the open wound a continuous flow of carbon dioxide is insufflated. This is to <b>de-air</b> the wound so that no air enters the heart and large vessels during surgery. An exchange of gases occurs between the tissue of the wound and the applied carbon dioxide. Throughout the surgery the wound will bleed and that blood will be evacuated in to the cardiotomy-reservoir. This can increase the total carbon dioxide level of the patient. The subject that was studied in this report was how to decrease the carbon dioxide levels in the blood. The method used was to fill the cardiotomy-reservoir with chosen volumes of water and simultaneously insufflate carbon dioxide and air. This was to measure the effectiveness of the evacuation of carbon dioxide. The results were that, despite water levels and carbon dioxide supply, one was able to ventilate the reservoir.

50|$|Pottery is made {{by forming}} a ceramic (often clay) body into objects of a {{required}} shape and heating them to high temperatures in a kiln which removes all {{the water from the}} clay, which induces reactions that lead to permanent changes including increasing their strength and hardening and setting their shape. A clay body can be decorated before or after firing; however, prior to some shaping processes, clay must be prepared. Kneading helps to ensure an even moisture content throughout the body. Air trapped within the clay body needs to be removed. This is called <b>de-airing</b> and can be accomplished either by a machine called a vacuum pug or manually by wedging. Wedging can also help produce an even moisture content. Once a clay body has been kneaded and de-aired or wedged, it is shaped by a variety of techniques.

Study II: Acute intraoperative plateletpheresis (APP) with 25 % circulating platelet yield was performed in 18 young adult patients undergoing Ross operation. APP in combination with 2 million units of aprotinin reduced the combined need of all blood product transfusions by 47 % compared to a matched cohort of 19 patients also undergoing the Ross operation and receiving 2 million units of aprotinin alone (p=. 036). Study III: Twenty patients undergoing elective open left heart surgery were de-aired alternately and prospectively either with the conventional technique, (pleural cavities unopened, dead space ventilation during cardiopulmonary bypass) or with a new <b>de-airing</b> technique (pleural cavities open, ventilator disconnected during cardiopulmonary bypass, staged perfusion and ventilation of lungs) The new <b>de-airing</b> technique significantly reduced the <b>de-airing</b> time (10 vs 17 minutes, p<. 001) and provided significantly greater freedom from residual air emboli (p= <. 001).

40|$|Background: Cardiac and {{pulmonary}} veins <b>de-airing</b> are of {{the most}} important steps during open heart surgery. This study evaluates the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on air trapping in pulmonary veins and on quality of <b>de-airing</b> procedure. Materials and Methods: This randomized prospective double blind clinical trial conducted on 40 patients. In the control group: During cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the ventilator was turned off and adjustable pressure limit (APL) valve was placed in SPONT position. In CPAP group: During CPB, after turning the ventilator off, the flow of oxygen flow was maintained at the rate of 0. 5 L/min and the APL valve was placed in MAN position on 20 mbar. During cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) weaning, the patients were observed for air bubbles in left atrium by using transesophageal echocardiography. Results: The mean <b>de-airing</b> time after the start of mechanical ventilation in CPAP group (n = 20) was significantly lower than the control group (n = 20) (P = 0. 0001).

40|$|Background: Residual air {{accumulated}} {{air in the}} pulmonary veins {{constitutes a}} challenge to achievment of complete <b>de-airing</b> in open left heart surgery. To adress this problem, a conceptual method for <b>de-airing</b> was developed in Lund comprising bilateral opening of the pleurae to induce pulmonary collapse and a strategy with gradual pulmonary reperfusion and ventilation at weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Aim: To evaluate effectiveness and safety aspects of the Lund concept for <b>de-airing.</b> Methods and results: In the first paper a randomized controlled study was conducted comparing the Lund method to a standardized carbon dioxide (CO 2) insufflation technique in twenty patients undergoing open left heart surgery. The number of cerebral microembolic signals (MES) was monitored by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) during <b>de-airing</b> {{and in the first}} ten minutes after CPB. Residual intracardiac air during the first ten minutes after CPB was graded by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The frequency of reopenings of the left ventricular (LV) vent during the first ten minutes after CPB was registered as well as the duration of the <b>de-airing</b> procedure. Compared to the CO 2 insufflation technique, the Lund method resulted in fewer MES during <b>de-airing</b> (p 6 kPa) despite compensational higher gas flows in the oxygenator at 30 minutes of CPB (p< 0. 001) and acidosis (pH< 7. 35) already at 15 min of CPB, (p< 0. 01). CO 2 production (VCO 2 mL/min) increased during CPB as did the respiratory quotient (RQ; p< 0. 001) secondary to the extraneously supplied CO 2. The mean blood flow velocities in both MCAs increased secondary to increasing PaCO 2 (p< 0. 001 at 45 and 60 minutes of CPB). rSo 2 measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) were also found higher at 30, 45 and 60 minutes of CPB (p< 0. 05, p< 0. 01 and p< 0. 01, respectively). Scanning electron microscope imaging the cardiotomy suction and LV vent line tubing showed a higher fraction of morphologically changed red blood cells in the CO 2 insufflation group. In the third paper we aimed to study the contribution of each component constituting the Lund concept. In a randomized controlled study of twenty patients undergoing open left heart surgery, we compared a group with open pleurae and conventional pulmonary reperfusion and ventilation to a group with intact pleurae combined with staged pulmonary reperfusion and ventilation. During <b>de-airing</b> and in the first ten minutes after CPB, there was a lower number of MES in the group with open pleurae (p< 0. 05, p< 0. 01, respectively). A lower amount of residual intracardiac air was also registered in the group with open pleurae in up to six minutes after CPB (p< 0. 01). The LV vent was reopened fewer times in the group with open pleurae (p< 0. 001). <b>De-airing</b> time was also shorter in the group with open pleurae, 9 vs 14 minutes (p< 0. 05). In the fourth paper we studied the impact of single right pulmonary collapse on effectiveness of the Lund method and the effectiveness of a right superior pulmonary vein vent (RSPV). Twenty patients in two prospective cohorts with right pleura open and RSPV respectively, were compared to a historical control cohort from the first paper with bilateral open pleurae and left ventricular apical vent (LVAV). We found a higher number of MES after CPB in the group with single right pulmonary collapse and in the group with RSPV compared to bilateral pulmonary collapse and LVAV (p< 0. 001, p< 0. 01, respectively) but no differences in residual intracardiac air graded by TEE or in <b>de-airing</b> times. Conclusion: The Lund concept for <b>de-airing</b> was demonstrated to be an effective and safe alternative to the CO 2 insufflation technique. The effectiveness of the Lund method depends primarily on bilateral pulmonary collapse and it may preferably be combined with a left ventricular apical vent...|$|E

40|$|Background: The risks {{connected}} {{with the presence of}} air microemboli in open-heart surgery, have recently been emphasized by reports that their number is correlated with the degree of postoperative neuropsychological disorder. Insufflation of carbon dioxide (C 02) into the chest wound is used in open-heart surgery to de-air the heart and great vessels. A new insufflation device, a gas-diffuser, was compared with traditional devices for <b>de-airing</b> in an experimental wound model. Finally, to assess the clinical value Of C 02 insufflation into the cardiothoracic wound, the effect of such insufflation on the incidence and behavior of microemboli in the heart and ascending aorta was studied under the conditions of a randomized clinical trial. Methods: In a cardiothoracic wound model, a full-size torso, the degree of air displacement achieved by the gas-diffuser, was compared with that of a 2. 5 mm. open-ended tube, a 6. 35 mm open-ended tube, a multiperforated catheter, and a gauze sponge, respectively, during steady state. The influence of suction, varying C 02 flow rates, an open pleural cavity, exposure to fluids and the position of the device were also evaluated. <b>De-airing</b> was assessed by measuring the remaining air content at the right atrium. In the trial, twenty (20) patients undergoing single valve surgery were randomly divided into two groups. Ten patients were insufflated with C 02 via a gas-diffuser and ten were not. Microemboli were ascertained by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) from release of the aortic crossdamp until 20 minutes after end of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Results: During steady state, the gas-diffuser produced efficient air displacement in the wound cavity model at C 02 flows of >= 5 I/Min (= 82 % and > 19. 5 % remaining air, respectively, at 2. 5 - 10 I/min C 02 flows (p< 0. 001). When using the gas-diffuser, an open pleural cavity prolonged the time needed to obtain a high degree of air displacement in the wound cavity (p= 0. 001). With suction of 10 I/min the median air content was still low (< 0. 50 %) at a simultaneous C 02 flow of 10 I/min. Conversely, suction of 25 I/min caused a marked increase in air content both at a C 02 flow of 5 and 10 I/min (p< 0. 001). When exposed to fluid, the gauze sponge and the multi-perforated catheter immediately became inefficient (70 % and 96 % air, respectively), whereas the gasdiffuser remained efficient (0. 4 % air). The two patient groups did not differ in clinical parameters. The median number of microemboli registered during the whole study period was 161 in the C 02 group versus 723 in the control-group (p< 0. 001). Corresponding numbers for the left atrium were 69 versus 340 (p< 0. 001), left ventricle 68 versus 254 (p< 0. 001), ascending aorta 56 versus 185 (p< 0. 001). In the C 02 group the median number of detectable microemboli after CPB fell to zero 7 minutes after CPB versus 19 minutes in the control group (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: The most efficient <b>de-airing</b> (< 1 % remaining air) in a cardiothoracic wound model was provided by a gas-diffuser at a C 02 flow of 10 I/min. For efficient <b>de-airing,</b> C 02 has to be delivered from within the wound cavity. Additional suction impaired air displacement with the gas-diffuser only when suction exceeded C 02 inflow. The gasdiffuser remained efficient after exposure to fluid, while both the gauze sponge and the multi-perforated catheter lost their function when they got wet.

Using available technology, we have devised a circuit and protocol that addresses these issues. To accomplish such support a bypass circuit consisting of 3 / 8 inch tubing {{connected to a}} centrifugal pump and low-prime heat exchanger was constructed. The circuit was primed via 1 / 4 inch spiked connectors attached to a 3 -liter bag of normal saline. After initial <b>de-airing,</b> the solution was recirculated through this bag. Patients were anticoagulated with 1 mg/kg of heparin prior to initiation of support. Left atrial-descending aorta bypass was used primarily. A cell salvage device was used for autotransfusion. All blood products were delivered via a rapid infusion device. During partial exsanguination, shed blood was not processed, but directed to the rapid infusor for immediate retransfusion. Any packed cells given were washed prior to transfusion. Citrate dextrose solution {{was used as an}} anticoagulant for the cell scavenger. This configuration was used successfully in 50 procedures during an 18 -month period. Use of this low-prime, custom circuit reduced both hemodilution and cost. A connection off the cell salvage pump offers fast retransfusion of shed blood during partial exsanguination. Minimal heparinization and citrate anticoagulation appears to reduce coagulopathy...|$|E
40|$|Arterial line {{filters are}} now {{routinely}} used in cardiac surgery {{in order to}} decrease the microemboli load to the patient. The Quart ® filter (Jostra, Hirrlingen, Germany) with a new planar construction design, an easy <b>de-airing</b> system and an integrated bypass, was tested for air filtration capacity and resistance to blood path in a standardized setting with surviving animals. Three calves (mean body weight: 71 – 3. 4 kg) were connected to a standard cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit by jugular venous and carotid arterial cannulation with a mean flow rate of 3. 5 l/min. The arterial line filter was challenged with upstream injections of boluses of air of 5, 10 and 15 ml, respectively. A Doppler ultrasound was positioned downstream on the arterial line to measure bubble count and size. The pressure drop through the filter was monitored at flow rates of between 1 and 6 l/min. At {{the end of the}} procedure the animals were weaned from the CPB and, thereafter, from the ventilator. After 7 days, the animals were sacrificed electively. This study shows that important quantities of air can be injected into the arterial line upstream of the filter with small volumes of small sized bubbles recorded downstream. With the 5 ml air bolus injection, mean values of 0. 3 – 0. 6 bubbles of 30 and 40 m m were detected, whereas with the 20 m...|$|E
40|$|AIMS This {{document}} aims {{to describe}} a standardised methodology for performing left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) using the AMPLATZER Amulet device, and to provide useful tips and tricks for operators with different levels of experience. METHODS AND RESULTS Physicians who are experts in LAAO and had personal clinical experience with the AMPLATZER Amulet device were asked to contribute {{in the preparation of}} this consensus document. Twenty-seven physicians (20 interventional cardiologists and 7 electrophysiologists) from 14 different countries reviewed the manuscript. A step-by-step approach, simulating a real case, was followed. Starting with patient selection and planning, related cardiac imaging is discussed, followed by vascular access - transseptal puncture optimisation. Then, angiographic calibration/sizing and the required fluoroscopy views are explained and a device sizing strategy is proposed. Device preparation and <b>de-airing</b> is briefly described, followed by sheath exchange, device deployment steps, evaluation of device stability and decision for final release. The way to recapture and change a device is then shown, together with some additional tips {{on how to deal with}} challenging anatomies like "chicken wing" left atrial appendage. Finally, for operators who are switching from AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug to Amulet, the main differences between the two devices with respect to implantation technique are presented. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, this document reflects a consensus approach by expert implanters on the steps of LAAO technique and best practices for implantation of the AMPLATZER Amulet device, along with some practical tips to minimise the complication rate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Risks {{associated}} with air emboli introduced during cardiac surgery have been highlighted by reports of postoperative neuropsychological dysfunction, myocardial dysfunction, and mortality. Presently, {{there are no}} standard effective methods for quantifying potential emboli in the bloodstream during cardiac surgery. Our objective was to develop software that can automatically detect and quantify air bubbles within the ascending aorta and/or cardiac chambers during cardiac surgery in real time. Findings We created a software algorithm (“Detection of Emboli using Transesophageal Echocardiography for Counting, Total volume, and Size estimation”, or DETECTS™) to identify and measure potential emboli present during cardiac surgery using two-dimensional ultrasound. An in vitro experiment was used to validate the accuracy of DETECTS™ at identifying and measuring air emboli. An experimental rig was built to correlate the ultrasound images to high definition camera images of air bubbles created in water by an automatic bubbler system. There was a correlation between true bubble size and the size reported by DETECTS™ in our in vitro experiment (r[*]=[*] 0. 76). We also tested DETECTS™ using TEE images obtained during cardiac surgery, and provide visualization of the software interface. Conclusions While monitoring the heart during cardiac surgery using existing ultrasound technology and DETECTS™, the operative team can obtain real-time data on the number and volume of potential air emboli. This system will potentially allow <b>de-airing</b> techniques to be evaluated and improved upon. This could lead to reduced air in the cardiac chambers after cardiopulmonary bypass, possibly {{reducing the risk of}} neurological dysfunction following cardiac surgery...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Systemic {{effects of}} carbon dioxide (CO(2)) {{insufflation}} during left-sided cardiac surgery were evaluated in a prospective randomized study, with regard to acid-base status, gas exchange, cerebral hemodynamics, and red blood cell morphology. METHODS: Twenty patients undergoing elective left-sided cardiac surgery were randomized to <b>de-airing</b> procedure either by CO(2) insufflation technique (CO(2) group, n = 10) or by Lund technique without CO(2) insufflation (Lund group, n = 10). Groups underwent assessment of acid-base status by intermittent arterial blood gases and in-line blood gas monitoring. Capnography {{was used to determine}} volume of CO(2) produced. Cerebral hemodynamics was measured by transcranial Doppler sonography and near-infrared spectroscopy. Red cell morphology from cardiotomy suction and vent tubing was studied by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Patients in the CO(2) group consequently developed significantly higher levels of hypercapnia with a concomitant increase in the volume of CO(2) produced despite significantly higher oxygenator gas flows compared with the Lund group. Effects on cerebral hemodynamics were observed in the CO(2) group with significantly higher blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery and higher regional cerebral saturation. Red blood cell damage was observed in the CO(2) group by scanning electron microscopy (97 % in CO(2) group vs 18 % in Lund group). CONCLUSIONS: Insufflation of CO(2) into the cardiothoracic wound cavity during left-sided cardiac surgery can induce hypercapnic acidosis and increased cerebral blood flow and local blood cell damage. These systemic effects should be monitored by in-line capnography and acid-base measurements for early and effective correction by increase in gas flows to the oxygenator...|$|E

40|$|Objective : The {{bidirectional}} Glenn shunt {{is commonly}} performed under cardiopulmonary bypass for conditions {{that lead to}} a single ventricle repair. We report our experience of bidirectional Glenn shunt done without cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods : Between June 2007 and May 2009, 186 consecutive patients underwent off-pump bidirectional Glenn shunt {{for a variety of}} complex cyanotic congenital heart defects. Age ranged from four months to six years and the median weight was 11. 17 kg (range 4. 3 - 18). After systemic heparinization, the procedure was done by creating a temporary shunt between the innominate vein and the right atrium connected across a three way connector for <b>de-airing.</b> Fifty one patients had bilateral cavae. All cases underwent complete clinical neurological examination. Results : No case required conversion onto cardiopulmonary bypass. Four patients (2. 14 &#x 0025;) died in the immediate postoperative period. The mean internal jugular venous pressure on clamping the decompressed superior vena cava was 24. 69 &# 177; 1. 81 mm Hg. There was no intra-operative hemodynamic instability and oxygen saturation was maintained at more than 70 &#x 0025; throughout. Post Glenn shunt, the saturations improved to mid 80 s. Seventy four cases had documented forward flow across the pulmonary valve. The mean duration of ventilation was 10. 17 &# 177; 8. 96 hours and there were no neurological complications. Six patients (3. 22 &#x 0025;) developed pleural effusions, 4 patients (2. 15 &#x 0025;) had nodal rhythm and 9 patients (4. 83 &#x 0025;) had superficial sternal wound infection. Conclusions : Our results show that off-pump bidirectional Glenn shunt can be done safely in patients not requiring associated intra-cardiac correction. It avoids cardiopulmonary bypass and its related complications, is economical and associated with excellent results. In our opinion, this is the largest series of off-pump bidirectional Glenn shunt in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Lateral soil {{pressure}} is recognized {{to be an}} important parameter in soil mechanics theory and in engineering practice, but is equally difficult to measure because it is sensitive to disturbance created by the insertion of a measuring device into the soil. A step-tapered blade has been developed to overcome this hurdle, by measuring horizontal soil pressures using pneumatically operated cell sensors on four thicknesses of blades, and extrapolating the results to zero thickness to obtain the in situ stress in soil;The pneumatic stepped blade was successfully designed and field tested, and is commercially available. A modified version was made to operate electronically. The electric blade used in this dissertation consists of two steps corresponding to the thinnest steps of pneumatic stepped blade. Each step is equipped with two electronic transducers, one to measure the lateral total soil pressure and the other for soil pore water pressure. By connecting the two-stepped blade to a portable data processor, these two pressures can be measured simultaneously and their decays over time can be monitored;The trends in soil pressure with time from the stepped blade data indicate the pressure measurement and <b>de-airing</b> system are properly designed, but not perfected. The main problem that remains to be solved is to effectively and permanently waterproof the stress transducers. Results from comparison between lateral stresses and K[subscript] o values from both pneumatic and electric blade show that data obtained from both stepped blades are equivalent and reproducible, and the data reflect the variations in the known soil profile at the testing site;Based on the pressure dissipation relationships, a tentative method for estimating the rate of soil consolidation is proposed. The method includes a consideration of the aspects of stress-strain relations of soils, the theory related to the design of the stepped blade, the soil response due to the blade insertion, and soil consolidation theory. The theoretical analysis involved in the method is not rigorous, but the distribution of the estimated coefficients of consolidation with soil depth follows the variations of the soil profile. Furthermore, the predicted coefficients of consolidation are shown to be comparable with the results determined from laboratory oedometer tests...|$|E
40|$|This project {{focused on}} {{advancing}} radio-frequency (RF) lamination technology closer to commercial implementation, {{in order to}} reduce the energy intensity of glass lamination by up to 90 %. Lamination comprises a wide range of products including autoglass, architectural safety and innovative design glass, transparent armor (e. g. bullet proof glass), smart glass, mirrors, and encapsulation of photovoltaics. Lamination is also the fastest growing segment of glass manufacturing, with photovoltaics, architectural needs, and an anticipated transition to laminated side windows in vehicles. The state-of-the-art for glass lamination is to use autoclaves, which apply heat and uniform gas pressure to bond the laminates over the course of 1 to 18 hours. Laminates consist of layers of glass or other materials bonded with vinyl or urethane interlayers. In autoclaving, significant heat energy is lost heating the chamber, pressurized air, glass racks, and the glass. In RF lamination, the heat is generated directly in the vinyl interlayer, causing it to heat and melt quickly, in just 1 to 10 minutes, without significantly heating the glass or the equipment. The main purpose of this project was to provide evidence that low energy, rapid RF lamination quality met the same standards as conventionally autoclaved windows. The development of concepts for laminating curved glass with RF lamination was a major goal. Other primary goals included developing a stronger understanding of the lamination product markets described above, and to refine the potential benefits of commercial implementation. The scope of the project was to complete implementation concept studies in preparation for continuation into advanced development, pilot studies, and commercial implementation. The project consisted of 6 main tasks. The first dealt with lamination with poly-vinyl butyral (PVB) interlayers, which prior work had shown difficulties in achieving good quality laminates, working with Pilkington North America. The second task dealt with a study of current lamination processes in the various laminate industries, and development of concepts for integrating RF lamination into new or existing processes. The third task explored the use of a non-destructive technique for analyzing laminate adhesion with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The fourth task focused on developing concepts for curved glass lamination using RF lamination. The fifth and sixth tasks together comprised an analysis of laminate product markets, ranking for applicability and commercialization potential, and the development of commercialization strategies for those products. In addition, throughout the project as new experimental data and conventional process data were obtained, the benefits analysis of RF lamination was refined. The goals of the project described above were achieved, positioning RF lamination for the next stage growth envisioned in the original Industrial Grand Challenge proposal. Working with Pilkington North America, lamination of flat autoglass with PVB was achieved, meeting all 16 stringent industry tests. In particular, PVB laminates made with RF lamination passed environmental tests including the high temperature, 120 ÃÂÃÂ°C bake test, without significant formation of bubbles (defects). The adhesion of PVB to glass was measured using the pummel method. Adhesion values ranging from 1 to 7 out of 10 were obtained. The significant process parameters affecting the environmental and adhesion performance were identified through a designed experiment. Pre-lamination process variables including PVB storage humidity and the <b>de-airing</b> process (vacuum or nip rolling) were significant, as well as the level of pressure applied to the laminate during the RF process. Analysis of manufacturing with RF lamination equipment, based on the processes developed indicated that 3 RF presses could replace a typical auto-industry autoclave to achieve equal or greater throughput with possibly less capital cost and smaller footprint. Concepts for curved lamination identifying castable molds for prototyping were developed, which allowed Ceralink to obtain commitment to begin curved tooling development. The project significantly helped to advance RF lamination past the feasibility and novelty stage and into the realm of commercial acceptance as a viable alternative to autoclaves. The demonstration of autoclave-quality autoglass produced in just 1 minute with RF lamination, with validation by Pilkington, has fueled industry motivation to seriously consider RF lamination. The industry and other contacts and outreach made in the study of laminate markets (including 3 technical publications and 5 conference presentations), has resulted in a recent surge in RF lamination activity...|$|E
