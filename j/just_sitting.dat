5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

25|$|The {{desirability}} of hiring directors over 60 is fairly diminished in this marketplace. At the same time, I hadn't had a good-sized hit {{in quite a}} while. And, frankly, I went {{through a couple of}} experiences that left me pretty disgusted with it all, and I was thinking the time had passed. I was <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> at home reading magazines and looking out the window — a couple of projects I had had just fallen apart — when I got a call from Sly, who had sent me a script.|$|E

25|$|Jack Whitaker and Frankie Frisch {{announced}} the backup games from 1959 to 1961. They usually did games {{that took place}} in Philadelphia, New York City, Washington, D.C. or Baltimore. Whitaker once said in three years, he would only broadcast three innings because CBS would not switch away from Dizzy Dean. However, he said that he learned a lot of baseball <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> next to Frisch. CBS had other backup crews for games featuring the Chicago Cubs and White Sox, Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds. In these cases, Bob Finnegan would handle the play-by-play duties with various analysts depending on the city. CBS did not have Game of the Week rights from any other ballparks in those years.|$|E
25|$|Although mice {{are small}} animals and {{care must be}} taken to avoid injury, they are also {{surprisingly}} robust and inquisitive. Once out of the cage many enjoy running along their owners' arms, investigating pockets, or <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> on the owner's lap and grooming. Some mice also tolerate gentle petting. Care must be taken as mice have poor eyesight and may try to lean too far over an edge and fall. Care must especially be taken when being handled by small children as they may be overly rough. Fancy mice very rarely bite except when hurt or very frightened. Biting behavior may result from improper handling, as mice are generally considered non-aggressive. They do have a greater likelihood of biting unfamiliar people, especially males who are wild and territorial.|$|E
500|$|Among the Canadians, {{only two}} players were not suspended: goalie Jimmy Waite and forward Pierre Turgeon. [...] Waite {{felt he could}} not risk being ejected for {{fighting}} under {{the belief that the}} game would resume, and that the Canadian backup goaltender, Shawn Simpson, was injured. [...] Steve Nemeth would later apply for early reinstatement arguing that he was not fighting, but trying to help break the players apart. [...] Many of their teammates never forgave Turgeon for failing to defend his teammates. In the words of Everett Sanipass: [...] "I'm looking for someone to help (Stéphane) Roy out and I look over at the bench. [...] There's this dog Turgeon, <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> there, with his head down. He wouldn't get his ass off the bench ... <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> there when everyone's off the Soviet bench and at least one of our guys is in real trouble getting double-teamed." ...|$|E

500|$|In November 2015, guitarist James Valentine {{spoke about}} the band's {{strategy}} moving onto their sixth studio album, saying the group wanted [...] "to make a more traditional record next ... like the way we made Songs About Jane, <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> {{in a room with}} our instruments and slugging it out.

500|$|Roger Ebert {{reasoned}} that [...] "part of {{the pleasure of}} movie-going is pure spectacle—of <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> there and looking at great stuff and knowing it looks terrific. There wasn't much Schumacher could have done with the story or the music he was handed, but in the areas over which he held sway, he has triumphed." [...] In contrasting between {{the popularity of the}} Broadway musical, Michael Dequina of Film Threat magazine explained that [...] "it conjures up this unexplainable spell that leaves audiences sad, sentimental, swooning, smiling—in some way transported and moved. Now, in Schumacher's film, that spell lives on." ...|$|E
500|$|At the session, Gaga led the {{direction}} of the production based on her preferences and influences, and used a piano and guitar to compose the song. Ronson explained that during their sessions Gaga was deeply involved with the technicalities of the music being recorded. Concerning this he confessed, [...] " [...] loves <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> at a piano and barking orders at a drummer and she has an incredible voice," [...] further clarifying that they would begin with the songs first and then go with the other aspects of the composition. In an interview for Rolling Stone, BloodPop recalled the singer being omnipresent always and it was her decisions which finalized the track's sound.|$|E

500|$|In March 2008, in an interview, Jason Statham {{said that}} [...] "somebody should just erase it from IMDb.... {{and put it}} back on there when it's fully due and ready.

500|$|To {{continue}} the tradition, the organization produces 20,500 white towels with the Canucks logo for each playoff game. [...] Following his first playoff game in 2007 Vancouver forward Alex Burrows stated [...] "It {{looks like the}} fans are really into {{the game and the}} atmosphere out there is something else, people are really passionate instead of <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> and no one moving or anything like some places. It just creates movement and it seems like there is more enthusiasm and intensity in the building." [...] As part of their 40th season celebration the Canucks organization commissioned a permanent statue of Nielson. Standing over 11 feet tall and weighing over 800 pounds the bronze statue depicts Nielson's mock surrender which started towel power.|$|E

Dolphin's ambulance partner, Tony Deluise of the New Haven Ambulance Company, said to the Boston Phoenix that he witnessed odd behavior while responding to Slee: [...] "They were all in seats, <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> there and facing the stage, like an audience.

500|$|The {{cast and}} crew were {{enthusiastic}} on set, with editor Steve Tucker calling it a [...] "giddy party". Behr said of the {{cast and crew}} in the episode that [...] "They all were having fun. <b>Just</b> <b>sitting</b> on those sets, being on that bridge, it was a hoot, a real hoot." [...] Deirdre L. Imershein was brought in at the last minute to play Lt. Watley, as she was a friend of one of the production crew and had previously appeared as a Risan pleasure girl in The Next Generation episode [...] "Captain's Holiday". She was brought in because none of the actresses the producers had seen during the casting process could say the role's one line ("Deck 15") convincingly enough. Her involvement led to the role's being expanded into a second scene where she was revealed to be Bashir's great-grandmother.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] is an {{evisceration}} of a no-good adolescent male, and {{is directed}} towards an ex-boyfriend. About the song's theme, Sean Dooley of About.com commented, [...] "Swift takes no prisoners in her quest {{to make a}} former flame feel her wrath for doing her wrong." [...] In the first verse, Swift introduces relationship by stating she acknowledged {{the fact that her}} former boyfriend was more in love with himself than with her. The second verse has Swift plotting retaliation: [...] "There's no time for tears / I'm <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> here planning my revenge / There's nothing stopping me / From goin' out with all of your best friends." [...] For the refrains, she speaks of igniting fire on photographs of her ex-boyfriend, concluding them with a musical punch line, [...] "As far as I'm concerned / You're just another picture to burn". Critics have found the song to a symbol of feminism.|$|E
500|$|... "Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows" [...] (January 17, 2002), a Family Guy episode which Povenmire directed, won the Emmy Award for Best Song. Creator MacFarlane, the {{recipient}} of the award, noted that Povenmire deserved to have received the award for the contribution the visuals made to the episode's win. Povenmire jokingly responded [...] "That's a nice sentiment and all, but did he offer to give me his? No! And it's not like he doesn't already have two of his own <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> in his house!" [...] Povenmire was nominated for an Annie Award for Directing in an Animated Television Production for the episode [...] "PTV" [...] (November 6, 2005) but lost out to a fellow Family Guy director Peter Shin, who had directed the episode [...] "North By North Quahog". Povenmire and several others were also nominated for their work on [...] "PTV" [...] in the Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour) category at the Primetime Emmy Awards. Povenmire also received the same nomination for [...] "Road to Rhode Island." ...|$|E

500|$|David Goodman comments, {{regarding}} the plot partially following Herbert that [...] "there {{is always a}} bit of trouble pitching a Herbert storyline to the network." [...] Samm Levine had originally been selected to voice Kyle, but the character was recast because, as show producer Seth MacFarlane comments, [...] "it seemed a lot funnier when Peter was beating up a kid if he was younger and more defenseless." [...] A deleted scene had been made which showed Chris asking for money and stating [...] "I spent my last ten bucks on a ham costume," [...] and Peter replying with [...] "it's <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> there right now, {{but you know what}} the great thing is, it's just three months until Halloween and I am done." [...] Peter's ancestor shown preparing to wrestle with a kangaroo was described by Seth MacFarlane to be [...] "a very strange gag," [...] which was added after the other parts of the episode had been created. Quagmire's profanity-laced tirade during the golf game was bleeped out on TV, but uncensored on DVD. The scene of Stewie remembering the time the Griffins had a nymphomaniac from Wisconsin in their attic was edited as FOX objected to the sounds of the woman having an orgasm being shown over a shot of a wide-awake Stewie.|$|E
500|$|Swift wrote [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] {{during her}} {{freshman}} year, {{knowing that she}} and her senior boyfriend, Brandon Borello, would break {{up at the end of}} the year when he left for college. Rose said Swift showed up at her after school job writing songs for Sony/ATV [...] "with the idea and the melody. She knew exactly what she wanted." [...] The nostalgic song describes a summer romance and Swift's hope that when Borello [...] "think Tim McGraw" [...] he would [...] "think [...] favorite song" [...] – McGraw's [...] "Can't Tell Me Nothin" [...] – and remember her. Conversely, [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] describes a girl furious after a break-up. Swift says that while the song is about [...] "just being mad" [...] and is [...] "completely, brutally honest"; she gave it a comedic edge. While at work after school, Swift [...] "found self <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> there with [...] guitar going, 'I hate his stupid truck that he doesn't let me drive. He's such a redneck! Oh my God!'," [...] a line which developed into the song's chorus. The up-tempo song is heavy with banjos and drums, while the chorus is marked by distorted guitars and big vocals.|$|E
500|$|When {{the tour}} was announced, U2 guitarist The Edge {{said of the}} show's design: [...] "It's hard {{to come up with}} {{something}} that's fundamentally different, but we have, I think, on this tour. Where we're taking our production will never have been seen before by anybody, and that's an amazing thing to be able to say. For a band like U2 that really thrives on breaking new ground, it's a real thrill." [...] Lead singer Bono said the design was intended to overcome the staid traditional appearance of outdoor concerts where the stage was dominated by speaker stacks on either side: [...] "We have some magic, and we've got some beautiful objects we're going to take around the world, and we're inside that object." [...] He also said that the group's goal was for the show to not be too choreographed. Williams said the goal is to establish a physical proximity: [...] "The band is <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> in the palm of the audience's hand." [...] At the conclusion of the tour, the intent was to leave the three structures in different parts of the globe and turn them into permanent concert venues. An auction of the stages was planned following the last concert.|$|E
