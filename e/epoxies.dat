5|$|For many years, the Moon {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an excellent site for telescopes. It is relatively nearby; astronomical seeing is not a concern; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold, and thus especially useful for infrared telescopes; and radio telescopes {{on the far side}} would be shielded from the radio chatter of Earth. The lunar soil, although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes, can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and <b>epoxies</b> and employed in the construction of mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter. A lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with ionic liquid.|$|E

The windings are typically stabilized by being impregnated with electrical epoxy potting systems. These are filled <b>epoxies</b> that have moderate mixed viscosity and a long gel time. They are highlighted by low shrinkage and low exotherm, and are typically UL 1446 recognized as a potting compound insulated with 180°C, Class H rating.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{performance}} {{and behavior of}} <b>epoxy</b> latex coatings are different from solvent-type ones. It is decided by the distinct curing mechanism. The solvent-type <b>epoxy</b> film obtained from <b>epoxy</b> resin and curing agent by homogeneous reaction, namely, the state of <b>epoxy</b> resin and curing agent is uniform. However, <b>epoxy</b> latex film made from <b>epoxy</b> resin emulsion or dispersion and water soluble amine by polyphase reaction. So the determination of potlife of <b>epoxy</b> latex can be showed by film gloss changes with residence time, dissimilar with solvent-type by the index of viscosity. The modern infrared spectrum measure shows that the <b>epoxy</b> groups in the dried <b>epoxy</b> latex film exist even if EEW to HAV proportion is 1. 2 : 1. This also testifies the incomplete polyphase reaction mechanism of <b>epoxy</b> emulsion coating curing at ambient temperature...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of an <b>epoxy</b> {{reactive}} diluent on the viscosity of a tetrafunctional <b>epoxy</b> precursor (TGMDA) has been analyzed for unfilled and nanofilled <b>epoxy</b> matrices. Despite very good mechanical performance of this <b>epoxy</b> resin, one of the current limitations of this <b>epoxy</b> precursor {{is related to the}} high value of the viscosity. This is a very critical point to manufacture CFRCs. In this paper we show an <b>epoxy</b> formulation able to overcome this drawback. In order to optimize the dispersion of MWCNTs inside the <b>epoxy</b> mixture, we have fluidified the initial <b>epoxy</b> precursors with an <b>epoxy</b> reactive monomer which has proven to be very effective to lower the viscosity of the nanoparticles/resin mixture and therefore in facilitating the nanofiller dispersion step...|$|R
50|$|<b>Epoxy</b> {{contains}} two parts {{which are a}} pigmented resin base and catalyst. The two parts are mixed in a specialized truck for <b>epoxy</b> marking application. The <b>epoxy</b> is then heated prior to spraying onto road surface. Retroreflective glass beads are applied using a separate bead gun behind the <b>epoxy</b> spray gun. Typically, <b>epoxy</b> markings last about 4 years.|$|R
25|$|Epoxy is more {{expensive}} than tape, but provides a greater mechanical bond between the heat sink and component, as well as improved thermal conductivity. The epoxy chosen must be formulated for this purpose. Most <b>epoxies</b> are two-part liquid formulations that must be thoroughly mixed before being applied to the heat sink, and before the heat sink {{is placed on the}} component. The epoxy is then cured for a specified time, which can vary from 2 hours to 48 hours. Faster cure time can be achieved at higher temperatures. The surfaces to which the epoxy is applied must be clean and free of any residue.|$|E
25|$|The {{susceptibility}} of a polymer to degradation {{depends on}} its structure. <b>Epoxies</b> and chains containing aromatic functionalities are especially susceptible to UV degradation while polyesters are susceptible to degradation by hydrolysis, while polymers containing an unsaturated backbone are especially susceptible to ozone cracking. Carbon based polymers {{are more susceptible to}} thermal degradation than inorganic polymers such as polydimethylsiloxane and are therefore not ideal for most high-temperature applications. High-temperature matrices such as bismaleimides (BMI), condensation polyimides (with an O-C-N bond), triazines (with a nitrogen (N) containing ring), and blends thereof are susceptible to polymer degradation in the form of galvanic corrosion when bare carbon fiber reinforced polymer CFRP is in contact with an active metal such as aluminium in salt water environments.|$|E
25|$|A {{thermoplastic}} synthetic wax resin mixture {{developed by}} John W Burke and Steve Colton in 1997 {{can be used}} to compensate losses in objects from translucent materials such as alabaster, marble, calcite, diorite, and anhydrite. The mixture consists of polyvinyl acetate (PVAC) AYAC, ethylene acrylic acid (EAA) copolymers A-C 540, and 580, antioxidants Irganox 1076 or 1035, dry pigments, marble powder, and other additives which were all melted together. This wax resin is a better substitute to wax-resins because wax collects dust and dirt and make the fill noticeable. Polyester resin and <b>epoxies</b> are toxic and noxious. The wax-resin is fast and easy to use, making it a possible new alternative to fill materials in the conservation field. The wax-resin works best on losses that allow for large contact with the original, primed surface and on losses that are thicker than 1/16in. Shallow losses and small gaps are more difficult due to the ease in which the fill is pulled out.|$|E

40|$|<b>Epoxy</b> ternary blends (DCN) were {{prepared}} by mixing diglycidyl ether bisphenol A (DGEBA), cycloaliphatic <b>epoxy,</b> and novolac <b>epoxy.</b> The silica diffusants {{were prepared}} {{by the addition of}} spherical silica (SS) into <b>epoxy</b> blends. The thermal properties of the <b>epoxy</b> composites were characterised using a thermo-mechanical analyser (TMA), a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), and a dynamic mechanical analyser (DMA). It was found that the storage modulus of the <b>epoxy</b> was increased in the presence of SS diffusants. However, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the <b>epoxy</b> ternary blends was reduced by the addition of SS diffusants, which was because the expansion of the <b>epoxy</b> matrix was constrained in the presence of silica fillers.

To provide <b>epoxy</b> based {{composites}} with self-healing ability, two-component healing system {{consisting of}} urea-formaldehyde walled microcapsules containing <b>epoxy</b> (30 ~ 70 µm in diameter) and CuBr 2 (2 -MeIm) 4 (the complex of CuBr 2 and 2 -methylimidazole) latent hardener was synthesized.

2500|$|Casting is a {{group of}} {{manufacturing}} processes by which a liquid material (bronze, copper, glass, aluminum, iron) is (usually) poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify.

Casting may be used to form hot liquid metals or various materials that cold set after mixing of components (such as <b>epoxies,</b> concrete, plaster and clay). Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods.

Teflon has very low absorption of 0.01%. Polyimides and cyanate esters, on the other side, suffer from high water absorption. Absorbed water can lead to significant degradation of key parameters; it impairs tracking resistance, breakdown voltage, and dielectric parameters. Relative dielectric constant of water is about 73, compared to about 4 for common circuitboard materials. Absorbed moisture can also vaporize on heating and cause cracking and delamination, the same effect responsible for [...] "popcorning" [...] damage on wet packaging of electronic parts.
