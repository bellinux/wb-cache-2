5|$|After the {{financial}} success of Saw, a sequel was immediately green-lit. Leigh Whannell and James Wan were busy preparing <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>next</b> film and {{were unable to}} write or direct. Bousman wrote a script called The Desperate before Saw was released and {{was looking for a}} producer but many studios rejected it. Hoffman received the script and showed it to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules. It was decided that, with some changes, it could be made into Saw II. Whannell became available to provide rewrites of the script. The film was given a larger budget and was shot from May to June 2005 in Toronto.|$|E

5|$|Development of Wild Guns {{began when}} a small team of Natsume staff was asked to create a game quickly and cheaply while waiting <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>next</b> major assignment. The team {{consisted}} of three core members: Shunichi Taniguchi for game design and graphics, Toshiyasu Miyabe for programming, and Hiroyuki Iwatsuki for sound. Two other people helped as support staff. The team chose to develop for the Super NES because the three had worked together previously on The Ninja Warriors (1994) for that system. Development of Wild Guns lasted approximately five months and was led by Taniguchi.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of their debut album Robbers & Cowards and {{spending}} the rest of 2007 touring across North America and Europe, the band started recording new material <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>next</b> album over the course of four months. Taking its title from the paper of the same name by American philosopher Josiah Royce, Loyalty to Loyalty carries a darker tone than its previous album by having a more experimental sound throughout and songs that deal with philosophies and politics, including suicide, crisis of faith, public security and job satisfaction.|$|E
5|$|Following their triumphant Earls Court appearances, Led Zeppelin took {{a holiday}} and planned an autumn tour in America, {{scheduled}} to open with two outdoor dates in San Francisco.

Before escaping from the explosion, the party encounters a dark knight whom Maria thinks she recognizes as Leon.|$|E

The album is a collection of Blur songs remixed by artists such as Thurston Moore, William Orbit and Moby.

Both teams then traded punts <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>next</b> six combined possessions before the Bulldogs missed a 23-yard field goal midway through the second quarter. On the Alabama drive that ensued, the Crimson Tide had their first of four turnovers on a Taveze Calhoun interception of an AJ McCarron pass. Alabama rebounded on their next possession with an 18-yard touchdown pass from McCarron to Brian Vogler that made the halftime score 10–0.|$|E

Little's Flight featured Clark trying to lend emotional support to a young girl who has full-sized wings. The next Aspect novel, Hauntings, followed Clark and his friends as they investigate a ghostly presence in one of Smallville's haunted houses. Animal Rage followed Clark as he tries to stop an animal rights activist when she tries to hurt the people harming animals in Smallville.

5|$|Stories also link Bahuchara {{to gender}} {{variance}} after she becomes divine. One myth concerns a king who prayed to Bahuchara for a son. Bahuchara complied, but the prince {{grew up to}} be impotent. One night Bahuchara appeared to the prince in a dream and ordered him to cut off his genitals, wear women's clothes and become her servant. Bahuchara is believed to continue to identify impotent men and command them to do the same. If they refuse, she punishes them: <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>next</b> seven incarnations they will be impotent. This myth is the origin of the cult of Bahuchara Mata, whose devotees are required to self-castrate and remain celibate.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{immediately}} began to prepare <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>next</b> attempt to recapture Henderson Field. The 3rd Battalion, 4th (Aoba) Infantry Regiment had landed at Kamimbo Bay on {{the western end of}} Guadalcanal on 11 September, too late to join Kawaguchi's attack on the U.S. Marines.

5|$|Adventure was {{published}} by the developer of the 2600 console, Atari, Inc, and programmed by Atari employee Warren Robinett. At the time, Atari programmers were generally given full control on the creative direction and development cycle for their games, but this required them to plan <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>next</b> game as they neared completion of their current one to stay productive. Robinett was finishing his work on Slot Racers when he was {{given an opportunity to}} visit the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Julius Smith, one of several friends he was sharing a house with. There, he was introduced to the 1977 version of the computer text game Colossal Cave Adventure, created by Will Crowther and modified by Don Woods. After playing the game for several hours, he was inspired to create a graphical version of the game.|$|E
5|$|After direct American {{intervention}} in 1965, the increased presence of U.S. naval vessels in coastal waters Operation Market Time nullified the seaborne route. The alternative devised by Hanoi was ingenious. Following on the agreement between Sihanouk and the Chinese, an arrangement was also struck between the prince and the DRV government. In October military supplies were sailed directly from North Vietnam on communist-flagged (especially of the Eastern bloc) ships to the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville, where that nation's neutrality guaranteed their delivery. The supplies were unloaded and {{then transferred to}} trucks which transported them to the frontier zones that served as PAVN/NLF Base Areas. These Base Areas also served as sanctuaries for PAVN/NLF troops, who simply crossed the border from South Vietnam and then rested, reinforced, and refitted <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>next</b> campaign in safety. None of {{this could have been}} accomplished without the acquiescence of Sihanouk.|$|E
