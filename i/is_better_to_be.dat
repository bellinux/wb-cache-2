25|$|Wherein it {{concerns}} states and rulers, Plato has made interesting arguments. For instance he asks which is better—a bad democracy or a country reigned by a tyrant. He {{argues that it}} <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ruled by a bad tyrant, than by a bad democracy (since here all the people are now responsible for such actions, rather than one individual committing many bad deeds.) This is emphasised within the Republic as Plato describes the event of mutiny on board a ship. Plato suggests the ship's crew to be {{in line with the}} democratic rule of many and the captain, although inhibited through ailments, the tyrant. Plato's description of this event is parallel to that of democracy within the state and the inherent problems that arise.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day, Alice wrote a {{much shorter}} letter to Louis {{in which she}} looked forward to their meeting, and hoped that [...] "my letter did not distress you – but it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite honest about all one's feelings". Despite marital problems, Alice remained {{a strong supporter of}} her husband, being highly critical when his abilities or talents were not fully recognised. On 20 March 1877, Louis' father Prince Charles died, making Louis heir apparent. On 13 June the same year, Charles' older brother Grand Duke Louis III died, and Louis and Alice became the Grand Duke and Duchess of Hesse. Her continued unpopularity in Darmstadt, however, coupled with her mother not wanting her in England, caused strain, and she and her children spent July and August in Houlgate, Normandy, where Louis often visited them. She was hurt by her reputation in Darmstadt, and she became increasingly bitter towards it; Louis wrote in August 1877 expressing the hope that [...] "bitterness of the salt water will drive away the bitterness that you still feel against Darmstadt. Please my darling, don't speak so harshly of it when I come to join you – it would quite spoil my happiness at seeing you again." [...] Alice took Louis's letter to heart, responding: [...] "I shall certainly say nothing to you about Darmstadt when you come...I have no intention of saying anything unpleasant, least of all to you. You shake off anything unpleasant like a poodle shaking off the water {{when it comes to the}} sea – natures like yours are the happiest in themselves, but they are not made to help, comfort and advise others, nor to share with others the heat of life's noon-day or the cool of the evening, with insight, understanding and sympathy." [...] In response, Louis sent a letter that [...] "made [...] cry", and after this letter, Alice's letters to Louis were more encouraging, assuring him of his ability to make decisions by himself.|$|E

2500|$|Next, {{against some}} vocal opposition, Brandt {{decided to move}} the next Socialist International Congress from Sydney, Australia to Portugal. Following this SI Congress in April 1983, Brandt retaliated against Carlsson by forcing him to step down from his position. However, the Austrian Prime Minister, Bruno Kreisky, argued on behalf of Brandt: [...] "It is a {{question}} of whether it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pure or to have greater numbers".|$|E
2500|$|... 1958 – General {{authority}} Bruce R. McConkie published Mormon Doctrine, {{in which}} he states that homosexuality is [...] "among Lucifer's chief means of leading souls to hell". In the section on [...] "Chastity" [...] he states that it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "dead clean, than alive unclean" [...] and that many Mormon parents would rather their child [...] "come back in a pine box with [...] virtue than return alive without it".|$|E

2500|$|While Hoyle was well-regarded for {{his works}} on {{nucleosynthesis}} and science popularization, he held controversial positions {{on a wide}} range of scientific issues, often in direct opposition to the prevailing theories of the scientific community. Paul Davies describes how he [...] "loved his maverick personality and contempt for orthodoxy", quoting Hoyle as saying [...] "I don't care what they think" [...] about his theories on discrepant redshift, and [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interesting and wrong than boring and right".|$|E
2500|$|Ibn Khaldun also anticipates Niccolò Machiavelli by {{attempting}} {{to answer the question}} of whether it is better for the ruler to be feared or loved. [...] Ibn Khaldun, like Machiavelli, answers that it is best to be both (though in The Prince, Machiavelli argues it's ultimately more effective for a ruler to retain power through fear). However, unlike Machiavelli, Khaldun believes that if that is not possible then it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loved than feared because fear creates many negative effects in the state's population.|$|E
2500|$|At a Sydney school, Muslim {{boys were}} {{told not to}} shake the hands of females {{presenting}} awards at the school. The instruction is understood to derive from an Islamic hadith which says, [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stabbed {{in the head with}} an iron needle than to touch the hand of a woman who is not permissible to you". There are claims that another Sydney public school is, [...] "run like a mosque" [...] with the school refusing to adopt a program aimed at countering violent religious extremism. [...] The principal of the school was removed.|$|E

2500|$|The Straight Course {{runs from}} the {{upstream}} end of Temple Island to a point opposite the upstream end of the Phyllis Court. It is [...] wide. The Straight Course has generally addressed the problems of unfairness: for example, between 1975 and 1984, 50.52% of races were won on Bucks and 49.31% on Berks (with the remainder dead heats). However, when a strong stream is flowing, the Berks station enjoys considerable shelter from the stream, particularly in the last ¼ mile. Conversely, {{when there is a}} strong south-westerly wind it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the Bucks station because it is more sheltered from the wind. The course is now piled and boomed along its entire length, except for crossing points. The booms can present a hazard for the inexperienced coxswain or steersman.|$|E
2500|$|... he {{executive}} {{authority is}} one. By this means we obtain very important advantages. We may discover from history, from reason, and from experience, the security which this furnishes. The executive power <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> trusted {{when it has}} no screen. Sir, {{we have a responsibility}} in the person of our President; he cannot act improperly, and hide either his negligence or inattention; he cannot roll upon any other person the weight of his criminality; no appointment can take place without his nomination; and he is responsible for every nomination he makes. We secure vigor. We well know what numerous executives are. We know there is neither vigor, decision, nor responsibility, in them. Add to all this, that officer is placed high, and is possessed of power far from being contemptible; yet not a single privilege is annexed to his character; far from being above the laws, he is amenable to them in his private character as a citizen, and in his public character by impeachment.|$|E
2500|$|Few human creatures would {{consent to}} be changed {{into any of the}} lower animals, for a promise of the fullest {{allowance}} of a beast's pleasures; no intelligent human being would consent to be a fool, no instructed person would be an ignoramus, no person of feeling and conscience would be selfish and base, even though they should be persuaded that the fool, the dunce, or the rascal is better satisfied with his lot than they are with theirs… [...] A being of higher faculties requires more to make him happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, and certainly accessible to it at more points, than one of an inferior type; but in spite of these liabilities, he can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence… It <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question… ...|$|E

2500|$|More probably, Anselm {{intended}} his [...] "single argument" [...] {{to include}} {{most of the}} rest of the work as well, wherein he establishes the attributes of God and their compatibility with one another. Continuing to construct a being greater than which nothing else can be conceived, Anselm proposes such a being must be [...] "just, truthful, happy, and whatever it <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> than not to be". Chapter 6 specifically enumerates the additional qualities of awareness, omnipotence, mercifulness, impassibility (inability to suffer), and immateriality; Chapter 11, self-existent, wisdom, goodness, happiness, and permanence; and Chapter 18, unity. Anselm addresses the question-begging nature of [...] "greatness" [...] in this formula partially by appeal to intuition and partially by independent consideration of the attributes being examined. The incompatibility of, e.g., omnipotence, justness, and mercifulness are addressed in the abstract by reason, although Anselm concedes that specific acts of God are a matter of revelation beyond the scope of reasoning. At one point during the 15th chapter, he reaches the conclusion that God is [...] "not only that than which nothing greater can be thought but something greater than can be thought". In any case, God's unity is such that all of his attributes are to be understood as facets of a single nature: [...] "all of them are one and each of them is entirely what [...] and what the other are". This is then used to argue for the triune nature of the God, Jesus, and [...] "the one love common to [...] and [...] Son, that is, the Holy Spirit who proceeds from both". The last three chapters are a digression on what God's goodness might entail. Extracts from the work were later compiled under the name Meditations or The Manual of StAustin.|$|E

50|$|During his premiership in {{the early}} 1960s Macmillan was savagely satirised for his alleged decrepitude by the comedian Peter Cook in the stage review Beyond the Fringe.
