The star phenomenon depends upon collapsing {{the distinction between the}} star-as-person and the star-as-performer. This does not usually mean that the incidents of a film's scenario are taken to be actual incidents in the star's life but rather that they 'reveal' or express the personality of the type-of-person of the star. In the case of Turner, however, not only do her vehicles furnish characters and situations in accord with her off-screen image, but frequently incidents in them echo incidents in her life so {{that by the end of}} her career films like Peyton Place, Imitation of Life, Madame X and Love Has Many Faces seem in parts like mere illustrations of her life.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between {{external and internal}} environments, however, is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality. There is an <b>interpenetration</b> {{of cause and effect}} between the environment and life. The laws of thermodynamics, for example, apply to ecology by means of its physical state. With an understanding of metabolic and thermodynamic principles, a complete accounting of energy and material flow can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way, the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated material parts. After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes; however, they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole, or holocoenotic system as it was once called. This is known as the dialectical approach to ecology. The dialectical approach examines the parts, but integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole (or umwelt). Change in one ecological or environmental factor can concurrently affect the dynamic state of an entire ecosystem.|$|E

Our focus is on firmly establishing three parameter-independent guarantees: that simulations of well-posed problems (a) have no <b>interpenetrations,</b> (b) obey causality, momentum- and energy-conservation laws, and (c) complete in finite time. We achieve these guarantees through a novel synthesis of asynchronous variational integrators, kinetic data structures, and a discretization of the contact barrier potential by an infinite sum of nested quadratic potentials. In a series of two- and threedimensional examples, we illustrate that this method more easily handles challenging problems involving complex contact geometries, sharp features, and sliding during extremely tight contact...|$|R

40|$|Structured {{deformations}} {{provide a}} multiscale geometry that captures the contributions at the macrolevel of both smooth geometrical changes and non-smooth geometrical changes (disarrangements) at submacroscopic levels. For each (first-order) structured deformation (g,G) of a continuous body, the tensor field G {{is known to}} be a measure of deformations without disarrangements, and M:=∇ g-G {{is known to be}} a measure of deformations due to disarrangements. The tensor fields G and M together deliver not only standard notions of plastic deformation, but M and its curl deliver the Burgers vector field associated with closed curves in the body and the dislocation density field used in describing geometrical changes in bodies with defects. Recently, Owen and Paroni [13] evaluated explicitly some relaxed energy densities arising in Choksi and Fonseca's energetics of structured deformations [4] and thereby showed: (1) (trM) ^+, the positive part of trM, is a volume density of disarrangements due to submacroscopic separations, (2) (trM) ^-, the negative part of trM, is a volume density of disarrangements due to submacroscopic switches and <b>interpenetrations,</b> and (3) |trM|, the absolute value of trM, is a volume density of all three of these non-tangential disarrangements: separations, switches, and <b>interpenetrations.</b> The main contribution of the present research is to show that a different approach to the energetics of structured deformations, that due to Baía, Matias, and Santos [1], confirms the roles of (trM) ^+, (trM) ^-, and |trM| established by Owen and Paroni.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} the {{modelling}} of the physical behaviour of woven structures imitating the textile fabrics. The model {{is based on a}} combined approach which presents longitudinal elastic properties of each yarn by a system of non-volumetric structural elements (springs), while the collision search and response algorithm works in a 3 D space based on tight-fitting of the yarns by using oriented bounding boxes (OBB). The separation axis theorem (SAT) for collision detection between OBBs is performed. Collision response is performed by applying collision impulses to colliding nodes thus avoiding <b>interpenetrations</b> of the yarns. A simplified approach is applied in order {{to take into account the}} deformation of the cross-section of a yarn. It is assumed that the cross-sectional area remains constant all the time while its shape is elliptic with changing lengths of axes. Numerical examples of simulation of tension, warp and shooting-through the fabric are presented...|$|R
