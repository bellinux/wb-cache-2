5|$|Writer Vince Gilligan was {{inspired}} to write the episode based on Time-Life mail order books he read as a child discussing the lives of serial killers. One of the books featured mass murderer Howard Unruh. The episode was also inspired by Ted Serios, whose thought-photographs were mentioned by Fox Mulder in the episode. The use of the dentist chair where Schnauz sat his victims was included considering people's common fear of the dentist. Gilligan had written the role of Schnauz with Taylor Vince <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{saw him in the}} Adrian Lyne film Jacob's Ladder. Vince had been approached to be a guest star on the show in the first season but declined the role due to it being too small.|$|E
25|$|Geoffrey's {{composite}} Merlin {{is based}} primarily on Myrddin Wyllt, also called Merlinus Caledonensis, and Aurelius Ambrosius, a mostly fictionalised version of the historical war leader Ambrosius Aurelianus. The former {{had nothing to do}} with King Arthur: in British poetry he was a bard driven mad after witnessing the horrors of war, who fled civilization to become a wild man of the wood in the 6th century. Geoffrey had this individual <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> wrote his earliest surviving work, the Prophetiae Merlini (Prophecies of Merlin), which he claimed were the actual words of the legendary madman.|$|E
25|$|Bournonville {{must have}} had the folk songs Elveskud (The Elf-shot) and Elvehøj (The Elves' Hill) <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> has Junker Ove linger at the hill after lunch with Miss Birthe, his fiancée, only to dream of another - a {{beautiful}} and gentle Hilda, the counter-image of Birthe. It is always at this point - the moment of doubt before a wedding - that the elves appear. For {{the young man in}} the folksong Elveskud, the encounter proves fatal. He refuses to dance with the elf girl and her punishment is so harsh that he dies. He is laid in his grave on his wedding day, followed by his fiancée and his mother. In Elvehøj, which is of a later date than Elveskud, it is God who has human fate in his hands. He lets the cock crow at dawn and the young man, who had slept by the hill, wakes from his spell (which turns out to have been a dream) and he counts himself lucky. The manager of the Royal Theatre, J.L. Heiberg - who Bournonville fell out with on numerous occasions during this period because he thought that Heiberg was trying to drive the ballet off the stage - had experienced great success with his Elvehøj, which in Biedermeier style, lets the elves' dance dissolve into dream and delusion.|$|E

[...] "Certain guys would have played Ferris and you would have thought, 'Where's my wallet?'" [...] Hughes said. [...] "I had to have that look; that charm had to come through. Jimmy Stewart could have played Ferris at 15...I needed Matthew." [...] Other actors who were {{considered}} for the role included Jim Carrey, John Cusack, Tom Cruise and Michael J. Fox.|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, Haggard {{spoke of}} how he {{composed}} She within a six-week period of February and March 1886, having just completed Jess, {{which was published in}} 1887. Haggard claimed that this period was an intensely creative moment: the text [...] "was never rewritten, and the manuscript carries but few corrections". Haggard went on to declare: [...] "The fact is that it was written at white heat, almost without rest, and that {{is the best way to}} compose."

500|$|Koen Decoster {{proposes that}} Josephus wrote of [...] "a citadel {{in the lower}} part of the city" [...] to an {{audience}} that would have been familiar with the Jerusalem of the 1st century CE—a city that did feature two citadels: the Antonia Fortress and the Herodian palace. As Josephus' Roman Jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill, [...] "a citadel in the lower city" [...] could have referred to anything located east of the Tyropoeon Valley, including the Antonia which stood north of the Temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it. In his view, this is the place Josephus must have had <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> wrote of the Acra.|$|E

500|$|In 1868 Gray had a year's {{leave of}} absence and visited Darwin in Englandthe first time they had met since they started their correspondence. Darwin had Gray <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> wrote, [...] "It seems to me absurd to doubt that a man may be an ardent theist & an evolutionist." [...] Darwin {{dedicated}} his 1877 book The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species to Gray [...] "as a small tribute of respect and affection". One area where Darwin and Gray disagreed was Darwin's theory of pangenesis. The Grays traveled to Europe again during 1880–1881, including a final visit to Down House, Darwin's home. He {{spent a year in}} Europe this time studying. Darwin died in 1882.|$|E
500|$|Ratnam cast Mohan, {{with whom}} he had worked in Idaya Kovil, as the male lead. Revathi, the female lead, had collaborated with Ratnam on Pagal Nilavu (1984). Ratnam {{initially}} had [...] "someone like Anant Nag and Supriya Pathak" [...] <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> finished writing Mouna Ragam. Between finishing the story and making the film, he decided to include Revathi, whose performance in Mann Vasanai (1983) impressed him. Nadhiya was also considered for the role, but she declined due to prior commitments. Ra. Sankaran was cast as Divya's father, Chandramouli, Kanchana as the lawyer and V. K. Ramasamy as Chandrakumar's boss. Vani plays Divya's mother and Bhaskar her brother; Kalaiselvi and Sonia play her sisters. Prabhu Deva, who became a successful Indian cinematic choreographer, made his acting debut in the film with an appearance in [...] "Panivizhum Iravu" [...] as a boy playing a flute.|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{emphasize}} winning, Tunis {{believed that}} values like {{hard work and}} perseverance could be taught through sports. The 1951football brochure for the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology Athletic Scholarship committee cites Tunis, saying [...] "The athletic department would like {{to feel that the}} existing program can do for the engineer what John Tunis had <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> said, 'The deep objective of games really is to train one’s reflex of purpose to develop a habit of keeping steadily at something you want until it is done. Many of Tunis' biggest heroes find themselves eventually brought low, like Roy Tucker in The Kid Comes Back, whose wartime service injury may have destroyed his career, or Iron Duke Jim Wellington at Harvard, ostracized and lonely, who perseveres by running track. The real victory is in the character's refusal to give up against long odds. [...] "My heroes are the losers" [...] he once said. [...] "All my books have been in that vein. Every book I've ever written." [...] In the Introduction to The Kid from Tomkinsville, Bruce Brooks writes [...] "for Tunis a win was what happened at the ballpark some of the time, usually just before a loss. It didn't make you a good person, [...] than a loss made you a jerk." ...|$|E

500|$|Other, less obvious, {{elements}} of the painting reveal more about the poet's personality and ideas. The poem he is attempting to write is entitled [...] "Upon Riches", {{which suggests that the}} poet lives in a fantasy world, while his wife and child go hungry. Ned Ward's first published poem in 1691 was The Poet's Ramble After Riches, which satirised his own struggles as an impoverished aspiring poet, and Hogarth may have had this <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> produced the picture. Earlier impressions showed the poem as [...] "Poverty, A Poem", which hinted at a connection to Theobald who had written [...] "The Cave of Poverty, A Poem, Written in Imitation of Shakespeare" [...] in 1714. The poet's dreams of riches are further suggested by the map that hangs over his head, entitled [...] "A View of the Gold Mines of Peru", replacing the image of Pope that appears in the earlier states of the print. The poet's self-interest is hinted by the presence of his pipe and tobacco on the window sill, the mug of beer sitting on the chair {{in the back of the}} room, the lace cuffs drying by the fire, his ill-fitting wig, and gentleman's sword lying at his feet; it may be that despite his family's circumstances, he refuses to forgo his own personal pleasures and effects. Alternatively, his fantasy of earning a fortune from his art may require that he keeps his gentlemanly accoutrements around him, as they will be required when his fantasies are realized.|$|E
500|$|Sean Connery as Professor Henry Jones: Indiana's father, a {{professor}} of Medieval literature who cared more about looking for the Grail than raising his son. Spielberg had Connery <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> suggested introducing Indiana's father, {{though he did not}} tell Lucas at first. Consequently, Lucas wrote the role as [...] "a crazy, eccentric" [...] professor resembling Laurence Olivier, whose relationship with Indiana is [...] "strict schoolmaster and student rather than a father and son". Spielberg had been a fan of Connery's work as James Bond and felt that no one else could perform the role as well. Spielberg biographer Joseph McBride wrote, [...] "Connery was already the father of Indiana Jones since the series had sprung from the desire of Lucas and Spielberg to rival (and outdo) Connery's James Bond movies." [...] Connery initially turned the role down as he is only twelve years older than Ford, but he relented. Connery—a student of history—began to reshape the character, and revisions were made to the script to address his concerns. [...] "I wanted to play Henry Jones as a kind of Sir Richard [...] Burton," [...] Connery commented. [...] "I was bound to have fun with the role of a gruff, Victorian Scottish father." [...] Connery believed Henry should be a match for his son, telling Spielberg that [...] "whatever Indy'd done my character has done and my character has done it better". Connery signed to the film on March25, 1988. He improvised the line, [...] "She talks in her sleep", which was left in because it made everyone laugh; in Boam's scripts, Henry telling Indiana that he slept with Elsa occurs later.|$|E

He is quoted as saying in 1986: [...] "I didn't grow up with the Supremes...I grew up with the Shirelles. Dreamgirls isn't about any one group.

60|$|All {{this was}} a part of Fate's mischievous prank. Sir Marmaduke was not afraid of meeting the old Quakeress, nor yet the surly smith; Richard being out of the way, he had no misgivings <b>in</b> his <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> retraced his steps towards the cottage.|$|R
60|$|He {{advanced}} a step--opened his lips--and suddenly checked himself.

[...] In 1956, Lewis recorded [...] "Rock-A-Bye Your Baby".|$|E
2500|$|England began day five {{looking as}} though they were looking to drag the day out for a draw, but Jones and Border had other ideas. Resuming their free-scoring from the {{previous}} evening, the pair moved rapidly onwards, Jones scoring at better than a run-a-ball for a well made 40 not out off 34 balls. Although not quite as rapid, Border's 60 not out off 76 was still quite pacey, and the captain clearly had a plan <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> soon declared the Australian innings closed at 230 for 3, leaving England an unlikely 401 for victory off two [...] sessions.|$|E
2500|$|Having overseen Kaiser Permanente's {{successful}} transformation from Henry Kaiser's healthcare experiment into a large-scale self-sustaining enterprise, Keene retired in 1975. By 1976, membership reached three million. In 1977, {{all six of}} Kaiser Permanente's regions had become federally qualified health maintenance organizations. Historians now believe then-President Richard Nixon specifically had Kaiser Permanente <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> signed the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, as the organization was mentioned in an Oval Office discussion of the Act, where John Ehrlichman characterized Kaiser's philosophy thus: [...] "All the incentives are toward less medical care, because the less care they give them, the more money they make." [...] In 1980, Kaiser acquired a non-profit group practice to create its Mid-Atlantic region, encompassing the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. In 1985, Kaiser Permanente expanded to Georgia.|$|E

[...] All My Children head writer Charles Pratt, Jr. was creating the role of Reese with Braun <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> offered her the role.

2500|$|In 2001, {{the town}} of Chichibu (秩父), Japan, {{under the name of}} [...] "Tokyo Theatre Company", {{produced}} an adaptation of The Mikado in Japanese. Locals believe that Chichibu was the town that Gilbert had <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> named his setting [...] "Titipu", but there is no contemporary evidence for this theory. Although the Hepburn system of transliteration (in which the name of the town appears as [...] "Chichibu") is usually found today, it was very common in the 19th century to use the Kunrei system, in which the name 秩父 appears as [...] "Titibu". Thus it is easy to surmise that [...] "Titibu", found in the London press of 1884, became [...] "Titipu" [...] in the opera. Japanese researchers speculate that Gilbert may have heard of Chichibu silk, an important export in the 19th century. The town's Japanese-language adaptation of The Mikado has been revived several times throughout Japan and, in 2006, the Chichibu Mikado was performed at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival in England.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{conflicting}} accounts {{as to when}} Shostakovich {{began the}} symphony. Officially, he {{was said to have}} composed it in response to the German invasion.

The composer stated, according to Testimony, that he had planned the symphony before the German attack and that he had [...] "other enemies of humanity" [...] <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> composed the [...] "invasion theme" [...] of the first movement. He had no problem calling the work the [...] "Leningrad" [...] Symphony. [...] "Which Leningrad?" [...] became the question after the publication of Testimony in the West.
