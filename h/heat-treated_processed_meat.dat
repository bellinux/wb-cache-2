40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the consumption patterns and preferences of some <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> products among residents in Riyadh Metropolitan area. Questionnaires were randomly distributed to 300 individuals representing Saudis and non-Saudis of which 276 answered questionnaires were received. Seventy-four percent of the participants consumed <b>processed</b> <b>meat,</b> and 62. 8 % of these people accustomed to eat <b>processed</b> <b>meats</b> for more than five years. Consumption of <b>processed</b> <b>meats</b> was mostly on weekly basis (35. 1 %), and associated with main meals, usually dinner (51. 9 %). Hamburgs ranked top (37. 4 %) as the most preferred products, followed by mortadella (8. 4 %). Consumers liked chicken (46 %) as <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> raw material and they preferred products to be prepared locally (82. 4 %). The bran name was the main reason that makes 77. 6 % of Riyadh residents purchase certain types of <b>processed</b> <b>meats.</b> Health concern was the reason for 62. 5 % of the non-consumer participants not eating <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> products.

Story narratives have been used effectively in changing health behaviours, including diet, but there is no research specific to <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> consumption. The current study examines the effect of story narratives on <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> consumption, with participants randomly presented with one of four messages: short-term health, long-term health, short-term environment or long-term environment, measuring the role of temporal frame and message focus. Temporal frame has been explored in previous research and found that the time frame a message is presented in can have an influence on the outcome behaviour. However, this has not been explored with direct (health) and indirect (environment) message focus. Two hundred and fifty two participants completed two online questionnaires. Participants’ <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> consumption, intentions, attitudes, perceived behavioural control and subjective norms for consuming <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> products where obtained at baseline and again, 7 days later. Results found that message focus had a significant effect on <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> consumption after the intervention with those who received an environmental message reporting less <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> consumption. There were no effects of temporal frame. The results suggest that indirect (environmental) messages are more persuasive in changing health behaviour than direct (health) messages.

40|$|In this {{cross-sectional}} study, {{we hypothesized}} that hemodialysis patients consuming greater <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> is associated with hypertension risk, which can be partly explained by the high sodium content in <b>processed</b> <b>meat.</b> From September 2013 to May 2014, one hundred and four patients requiring chronic hemodialysis treatment were recruited from hemodialysis centers. Data on systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure before receiving dialysis, and 3 -day dietary records of the recruited patients were collected. HD patients with systolic and diastolic blood pressures greater than 140 mmHg and higher than 90 mmHg, respectively, were considered hypertension risk. Protein foods were divided into 4 categories: red meat, white <b>meat,</b> soybeans, and <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> (e. g., sausage and ham). In a model adjusted for energy intake and hypertension history, additional servings of <b>processed</b> <b>meats</b> was positively associated to systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg (odds ratio [95 % confidence interval]: 2. 1 [1. 0 - 4. 3]), and diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg (odds ratio: 2. 5 [1. 2 - 5. 5]). After adjustment for dietary sodium contents or body mass index (BMI), most associations were substantially attenuated and were no longer significant. In systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg, one serving per day of red meats (β = - 1. 22, P <. 05) and white meats (β = - 0. 75, P =. 05) {{was associated with a}} reduced risk compared with one serving per day of <b>processed</b> <b>meats.</b> Similarly, compared with one serving per day of <b>processed</b> <b>meat,</b> a reduced risk of diastolic blood pressure higher than 90 mmHg was associated with one serving per day of red meat (β = - 1. 59, P <. 05), white meat (β = - 0. 62, P <. 05).

40|$|D ow nloaded from 2 Abstract Red and <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> intake is {{associated}} with increased risks of both colorectal adenoma and cancer. <b>Processed</b> <b>meats</b> contain nitrate and nitrite, precursors of N-nitroso compounds (NOC); furthermore, meats cooked at high-temperatures contain heterocyclic amines (HCA) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).

30|$|On {{the basis}} of global {{epidemiological}} and scientific studies, {{evidence suggests that the}} risk of CRC is increased by meat consumption (O’Keefe, 2016). The two recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis published in 2011 analyzed available prospective studies of red meat and CRC, and suggested that a high intake of red and <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> significantly increased the risk of CRC (Alexander et al., 2011; Chan, 2011). A meta-analysis (Chan, 2011) of observational studies on red and <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> intake and risk of colorectal adenomas was conducted and found that the summary RR of colorectal cancer for the highest versus the lowest intake was 1.22 (95 % CI=  1.11 – 1.34) and the RR for every 100 g/day increase was 1.14 (95 % CI=[*] 1.04 – 1.24). These indicated that high intake of red and <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> was associated with significantly increased risk of CRC (Chan, 2011). Based on numerous epidemiological and animal studies, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded that the evidence on the carcinogenicity of red and <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> was sufficient to classify <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> as “carcinogenic to humans” (Group 1) and red meat as “probably carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2 A) in 2015 (Domingo and Nadal, 2016).|$|R
40|$|A recent {{investigation}} by the World Health Organisation (WHO) {{has found that the}} consumption of <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> and potentially red meat promotes carcinogenesis and can increase the risk of colorectal cancer. This literature review aims to summarise both the red and <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> molecules associated with colorectal carcinogenesis and investigate their relationship with the pathogenic process of colorectal cancer. Literature relating to the carcinogenic effect of red and <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> molecules was critically reviewed. There are multiple molecules present in red and <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> with a potential carcinogenic effect on colorectal tissues. <b>Processed</b> <b>meat</b> is more carcinogenic compared to red meat because of the abundance of potent nitrosyl-heme molecules that form N-nitroso compounds. Studies have also noted that other molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic amines have potential mechanisms for the initiation of colorectal cancer pathogenesis. The non-human sugar molecule N-glycolylneuraminic acid may account for the carcinogenic effects of pork despite its heme content being comparable to that of chicken. Red meat products, especially those that have been processed, have a wide variety of carcinogenic molecules known to increase the risk of colorectal cancer.

For each study, relative risks and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were extracted and pooled with a random-effects model, weighting for the inverse of the variance, in highest versus lowest intake comparison, and dose-response meta-analyses. Red and <b>processed</b> <b>meats</b> intake was associated with increased colorectal cancer risk. The summary relative risk (RR) of colorectal cancer for the highest versus the lowest intake was 1. 22 (95 % CI  =  1. 11 − 1. 34) and the RR for every 100 g/day increase was 1. 14 (95 % CI  =  1. 04 − 1. 24). Non-linear dose-response meta-analyses revealed that colorectal cancer risk increases approximately linearly with increasing intake of red and <b>processed</b> <b>meats</b> up to approximately 140 g/day, where the curve approaches its plateau. The associations were similar for colon and rectal cancer risk. When analyzed separately, colorectal cancer risk was related to intake of fresh red meat (RR for 100 g/day increase  =  1. 17, 95 % CI  =  1. 05 − 1. 31) and <b>processed</b> <b>meat</b> (RR for 50 g/day increase  =  1. 18, 95 % CI  =  1. 10 − 1. 28).
