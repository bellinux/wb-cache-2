40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} <b>describing</b> <b>functions</b> {{inversion}} is {{used and the}} restoring force of a nonlinear element in a MDOF system is characterized. The <b>describing</b> <b>functions</b> can be obtained using linearized frequency response functions (FRFs). The response of the system to harmonic excitation forces at distinct frequencies close to the resonant frequency results in linearized FRFs. The nonlinear system can be approximated at each excitation frequency by an equivalent linear system. This approximation leads to calculation of the first-order <b>describing</b> <b>functions.</b> By having the experimental <b>describing</b> <b>functions</b> calculated and the systemâ€™s responses corresponding to the nonlinear element (measured or interpolated), nonlinear parameter identification can be performed.

50|$|Consider {{feedback}} {{around a}} discontinuous (but piecewise continuous) nonlinearity (e.g., an amplifier with saturation, or an element with deadband effects) cascaded {{with a slow}} stable linear system. Depending on the amplitude of {{the output of the}} linear system, the feedback presented to the nonlinearity will be in a different continuous region. As the output of the linear system decays, the nonlinearity may move into a different continuous region. This switching from one continuous region to another can generate periodic oscillations. The <b>describing</b> <b>function</b> method attempts to predict characteristics of those oscillations (e.g., their fundamental frequency) by assuming that the slow system acts like a low-pass or bandpass filter that concentrates all energy around a single frequency. Even if the output waveform has several modes, the method can still provide intuition about properties like frequency and possibly amplitude; in this case, the <b>describing</b> <b>function</b> method {{can be thought of as}} describing the sliding mode of the feedback system.|$|E
5000|$|In {{control systems}} theory, the <b>describing</b> <b>function</b> (DF) method, {{developed}} by Nikolay Mitrofanovich Krylov and Nikolay Bogoliubov in the 1930s, and extended by Ralph Kochenburger [...] is an approximate procedure for analyzing certain nonlinear control problems. It {{is based on}} quasi-linearization, which is the approximation of the non-linear system under investigation by a linear time-invariant (LTI) transfer function {{that depends on the}} amplitude of the input waveform. By definition, a transfer function of a true LTI system cannot depend on the amplitude of the input function because an LTI system is linear. Thus, this dependence on amplitude generates a family of linear systems that are combined in an attempt to capture salient features of the non-linear system behavior. The <b>describing</b> <b>function</b> {{is one of the few}} widely applicable methods for designing nonlinear systems, and is very widely used as a standard mathematical tool for analyzing limit cycles in closed-loop controllers, such as industrial process controls, servomechanisms, and electronic oscillators.|$|E

40|$|In {{the case}} of {{approach}} and landing, it is universally accepted that the pilot uses more than one vehicle response, or output, to close his control loops.

50|$|Function is not {{the same}} as purpose in the teleological sense. In the {{philosophy}} of biology, evolution is a blind process which has no 'goal' for the future. For example, a tree does not grow flowers for any purpose, but does so simply because it has evolved to do so. To say 'a tree grows flowers to attract pollinators' would be incorrect if the 'to' implies purpose. A function describes what something does, not what its 'purpose' is. However, teleological language is often used by biologists as a shorthand way of <b>describing</b> <b>function,</b> even though its applicability is disputed.|$|E
50|$|Although the <b>describing</b> <b>function</b> method {{can produce}} {{reasonably}} accurate results {{for a wide}} class of systems, it can fail badly for others. For example, the method can fail if the system emphasizes higher harmonics of the nonlinearity. Such examples have been presented by Tzypkin for bang - bang systems. A fairly similar example is a closed-loop oscillator consisting of a non-inverting Schmitt trigger followed by an inverting integrator that feeds back its output to the Schmitt trigger's input. The output of the Schmitt trigger {{is going to be}} a square waveform, while that of the integrator (following it) is going to have a triangle waveform with peaks coinciding with the transitions in the square wave. Each of these two oscillator stages lags the signal exactly by 90 degrees (relative to its input). If one were to perform DF analysis on this circuit, the triangle wave at the Schmitt trigger's input would be replaced by its fundamental (sine wave), which passing through the trigger would cause a phase shift of less than 90 degrees (because the sine wave would trigger it sooner than the triangle wave does) so the system would appear not to oscillate in the same (simple) way.|$|E
5000|$|Using this {{low-pass}} assumption, {{the system}} response {{can be described}} by one {{of a family of}} sinusoidal waveforms; in this case the system would be characterized by a sine input <b>describing</b> <b>function</b> (SIDF) [...] giving the system response to an input consisting of a sine wave of amplitude A and frequency [...] This SIDF is a modification of the transfer function [...] used to characterize linear systems. In a quasi-linear system, when the input is a sine wave, the output will be a sine wave of the same frequency but with a scaled amplitude and shifted phase as given by [...] Many systems are approximately quasi-linear in the sense that although the response to a sine wave is not a pure sine wave, most of the energy in the output is indeed at the same frequency [...] as the input. This is because such systems may possess intrinsic low-pass or bandpass characteristics such that harmonics are naturally attenuated, or because external filters are added for this purpose. An important application of the SIDF technique is to estimate the oscillation amplitude in sinusoidal electronic oscillators.|$|E
