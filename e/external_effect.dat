On the {{horizontal}} section the aperture will expand internally, a somewhat {{larger number of}} rays being thus reflected from the jambs; and the aperture being thus the smallest possible outside, this is the favorite military form of inlet window, always found in magnificent development in the thick walls of mediæval castles and convents. Its effect is tranquil, but cheerless and dungeon-like in its fullest development, owing to the limitation {{of the range of}} sight in the outlook, which, if the window be unapproachable, reduces it to a mere point of light. A modified condition of it, with some combination of the outlook form, is probably the best for domestic buildings in general (which, however, in modern architecture, are unhappily so thin walled, that the outline of the jambs becomes a matter almost of indifference), it being generally noticeable that the depth of recess which I have observed to be essential to nobility of <b>external</b> <b>effect</b> has also a certain dignity of expression, as appearing to be intended rather to admit light to persons quietly occupied in their homes, than to stimulate or favor the curiosity of idleness.|$|E
50|$|Dobb was {{an early}} theorist to {{recognise}} the relevance of <b>external</b> <b>effects</b> to market exchanges. In a market economy, each economic agent in an exchange makes decisions {{on the basis of}} a narrow range of information in ignorance of any wider social effects of production and consumption. When <b>external</b> <b>effects</b> are significant, it invalidates the information transmitting qualities of market prices so that prices will not reflect true social opportunity costs. He claimed that contrary to the convenient assumptions of mainstream economists, significant <b>external</b> <b>effects</b> are in fact pervasive in modern market economies. Planning that coordinates interrelated decisions before their implementation can take into account a wider range of social effects. This has important applications for efficient industrial planning, including decisions about the <b>external</b> <b>effects</b> of uneven development between sectors, and in terms of the <b>external</b> <b>effects</b> of public works, and for development of infant industries; this is in addition to widely publicised negative <b>external</b> <b>effects</b> on the environment.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore methods to {{incorporate}} <b>external</b> <b>effects</b> on decision making of public health programmes in a UK setting, using smoking cessation as an example. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) methodological guidance for evaluating public health programmes is missing the incorporation of <b>external</b> <b>effects.</b> Therefore {{there is a need}} for considering their incorporation in such evaluations and to assess what are the appropiate methods to do so. Smoking cessation is an example where epidemiological evidence of <b>external</b> <b>effects</b> exists but has not generally been incorporated into economic evaluation. This thesis therefore focused in measuring the impact, in terms of costs and QALYs lost, of the incorporation of passive smoking, smoking during pregnancy and transmission of smoking behavior into economic evaluation of smoking cessation programmes previously developed to inform policy. A static Markov model is used to incorporate passive smoking and smoking during pregnancy, whereas transmisison of smoking behaviour is incorporated through a dynamic model. The findings show that some <b>external</b> <b>effects</b> can be incorporated without a system dynamic model, when this does occur, a static Markov model may be used to account for <b>external</b> <b>effects</b> in economic evaluation. Sometimes, to incorporate <b>external</b> <b>effects,</b> the model needs a change of population. Because smoking cessation interventions are generally highly cost-effective, the incorporation of <b>external</b> <b>effects</b> does not appear to change policy decisions, but there is a clear impact on the magnitude of the ICER. Passive smoking and smoking during pregnancy have higher impact in terms of costs and QALYs lost than transmission of smoking behaviour. Our discussion considers the validity of the methods used; how much the decision making process would be affected considering or not <b>external</b> <b>effects</b> on economic evaluation of smoking cessation interventions; and other valuation approaches for <b>external</b> <b>effects,</b> such as contingent valuation.

6000|$|Born (May 1391) {{of such a}} noble stock, Charles was to {{know from}} the first all favours of nature and art. His father's gardens were the admiration of his contemporaries; his castles were {{situated}} in the most agreeable parts of France, and sumptuously adorned. We have preserved, in an inventory of 1403, the description of tapestried rooms where Charles may have played in childhood. (1) [...] "A green room, with the ceiling full of angels, and the DOSSIER of shepherds and shepherdesses seeming (FAISANT CONTENANCE) to eat nuts and cherries. A room of gold, silk and worsted, with a device of little children in a river, and the sky full of birds. A room of green tapestry, showing a knight and lady at chess in a pavilion. Another green room, with shepherdesses in a trellised garden worked in gold and silk. A carpet representing cherry-trees, {{where there is a}} fountain, and a lady gathering cherries in a basin." [...] These were some of the pictures over which his fancy might busy itself of an afternoon, or at morning as he lay awake in bed. With our deeper and more logical sense of life, we can have no idea how large a space in the attention of mediaeval men might be occupied by such figured hangings on the wall. There was something timid and purblind in the view they had of the world. Morally, they saw nothing outside of traditional axioms; and little of the physical aspect of things entered vividly into their mind, beyond what was to be seen on church windows and the walls and floors of palaces. The reader will remember how Villon's mother conceived of heaven and hell and took all her scanty stock of theology from the stained glass that threw its light upon her as she prayed. And there is scarcely a detail of <b>external</b> <b>effect</b> in the chronicles and romances of the time, but might have been borrowed at second hand from a piece of tapestry. It was a stage in the history of mankind which we may see paralleled, to some extent, in the first infant school, where the representations of lions and elephants alternate round the wall with moral verses and trite presentments of the lesser virtues. So that to live in a house of many pictures was tantamount, for the time, to a liberal education in itself.|$|E

To demonstrate the extent of bias due to the exclusion of within-family <b>external</b> <b>effects</b> when measuring the relative performance of inter-ventions for problem drinking and alcohol dependence. Methods: The timing and magnitude of treatment effects are modified to accommodate the external health-related quality of life impact of having a problem or dependent drinker in the family home. Results: The inclusion of within-family <b>external</b> <b>effects</b> reduces cost per QALY estimates of interventions for problem drinking and alcohol dependence thereby improving the performance of all evaluated interventions. In addition, the inclusion of within-family <b>external</b> <b>effects</b> improves the relative performance of interventions targeted at those with moderate-to-severe alcohol dependence as compared to interventions targeted at less severe alcohol problems. Conclusions: Failure to take account of <b>external</b> <b>effects</b> in clinical and eco-nomic evaluations results in an uneven playing field. Interventions with readily quantifiable health benefits (where social costs and benefits are predominantly comprised of private costs and benefits) are at a distinct advantage when competing for public funding against interventions with quantitatively important <b>external</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R

50|$|Guitar {{amplifiers}} {{have long}} included {{at least a}} few effect units, often tone controls for bass and treble, an integrated tremolo system (sometimes incorrectly labeled (and marketed) as vibrato), and/or a mechanical spring reverb unit. In the 2010s, guitar amps often have onboard distortion effects. Some 2010-era amps provide multiple effects, such as chorus, flanger, phaser and octave down effects. The use of offboard effects such as stompbox pedals is made possible by either plugging the guitar into the <b>external</b> <b>effect</b> pedal and then plugging the effect pedal into the amp, or by using one or more effects loops, an arrangement that allows effects to be electrically or mechanically switched in or out of the signal path as desired. In the signal chain, the effects loop is typically located between the preamplifier stage and the power amplifier stages (though reverb units generally precede the effects loop if both are featured on an amplifier). This allows the guitarist to apply modulation effects to the signal after it has been processed through the preamplifier, something generally desirable, particularly with time-based effects such as delay. By the 2010s, guitar amplifiers usually included a distortion effect. Effects circuitry (whether internal to an amplifier or not) can be taken as far as amp modeling, by which is meant alteration of the electrical and audible behavior {{in such a way as}} to make an amp sound as though it were another (or one of several) amplifiers. When done well, a solid state amplifier can sound like a tube amplifier (even one with power supply sag), reducing the need to manage more than one amp. Some modeling systems even attempt to emulate the sound of different speakers/cabinets. Nearly all amp and speaker cabinet modeling is done digitally, using computer techniques (e.g., Digital Signal Processing or DSP circuitry and software). There is disagreement about whether this approach is musically satisfactory, and also whether this or that unit is more or less successful than another.|$|E
