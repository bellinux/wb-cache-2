40|$|To {{determine}} {{the nature of}} the genetic component controlling susceptibility to leprosy and its subtypes, complex segregation analysis, by means of the POINTER strategy, was performed on 27 multigenerational pedigrees from Desirade, a Caribbean island where leprosy is highly prevalent. The results are consistent with the presence of a recessive or codominant major gene controlling susceptibility to leprosy per se and nonlepromatous leprosy, respectively. Under the major-gene model, tests of homogeneity to check for internal consistency of the sample and to compare subsamples according to an <b>epidemiological</b> <b>criterion,</b> the place of residence of the probands, were conducted; results of none of these tests were significant. However, we have noted that information on 3 generations (nuclear families with a pointer to the sibship) is of major importance for detecting major gene(s).

Objectives: To analyze the proportional increase of each treatment method, Hemodialysis (HD), Peritoneal Dialysis (DP) and Functional Renal Transplantation, {{and to establish}} the relationship among them and with the nephrologists rate pmp. Methods: Prevalence increase percentages were determined in each country and regions divided according to: a) the SLANH (geographical criteria); b) Global Burden of Disease study (GBD-WHO) (<b>epidemiological</b> <b>criteria).</b> Results: Percentage growth rate showed wide variability among the three methods, DP being the larger.

40|$|International audienceRoot-knot {{nematodes}} of {{the genus}} Meloidogyne are soil-borne, little mobile, polyphagous pests which threaten important sheltered crops such as vegetables or small fruits. They attack plant roots to feed and reproduce and {{have a major impact}} on crop yield. Most eco-friendly plant protection strategies are based on the use of resistant crops. The emergence of virulent nematode variants, which are adapted to the resistance, challenges the durability of such methods. Because virulent root-knot nematodes exhibit a reduced fitness on susceptible crops, combining both resistant and susceptible plants can help increase the efficacy and sustainability of resistance-based nematode control. Since nematodes have poor intrinsic dispersal ability, the association between resistant and susceptible plants should rely on crop rotation over cropping seasons, rather than on spatial arrangements. We proposed a semi-discrete model describing the population dynamics of plant roots and of nematodes within and over cropping seasons. This model, inspired by epidemiological concepts, was fitted to literature data on the within cropping season dynamics of susceptible tomato plants and avirulent nematodes; it was then extended to also account for resistant plants and virulent parasites. The model was used to compute optimal crop rotation strategies with respect to the minimization of an <b>epidemiological</b> <b>criterion</b> called AUDPC to increase crop yield over different time horizons (between 2 and 40 cropping seasons) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{describe}} the methodology {{used in the}} process of setting health priorities for community intervention in a community of older adults. METHODS Based on the results of a health diagnosis related to active aging, a prioritization process was conceived to select the priority intervention problem. The process comprised four successive phases of problem analysis and classification: (1) grouping by level of similarity, (2) classification according to <b>epidemiological</b> <b>criteria,</b> (3) ordering by experts, and (4) application of the Hanlon method. These stages combined, in an integrated manner, the views of health team professionals, community nursing and gerontology experts, and the actual community. RESULTS The first stage grouped the identified problems by level of similarity, comprising a body of 19 issues for analysis. In the second stage these problems were classified by the health team members by <b>epidemiological</b> <b>criteria</b> (size, vulnerability, and transcendence). The nine most relevant problems resulting from the second stage of the process were submitted to expert analysis and the five most pertinent problems were selected. The last step identified the priority issue for intervention in this specific community with the participation of formal and informal community leaders: Low Social Interaction in Community Participation. CONCLUSIONS The prioritization process is a key step in health planning, enabling the identification of priority problems to intervene in a given community at a given time. There are no default formulas for selecting priority issues. It is up to each community intervention team to define its own process with different methods/techniques that allow the identification of and intervention in needs classified as priority by the community...|$|E

Conditions for invasion are studied while crucial parameters (population density distribution, contact and water contamination rates, pathogen growth rates) and {{the characteristics of the}} networks (connectivity, directional transport, water retention times, mobility patterns) are varied. We analyze both simple, prototypical test cases and realistic landscapes, in which optimal channel networks mimic the water systems and gravitational models describe human mobility. Also, we show that the dominant eigenvector of J 0 effectively portrays the geography of epidemic outbreaks, that is, the areas of the studied territory that will be initially affected by an epidemic. This is important for planning an efficient spatial allocation of interventions (e. g., improving sanitation and providing emergency aid and medicines) ...|$|R

In males, the multivariate general linear model adjusted for age, alcohol, smoking, exercise, systemic hypertension, diabetes, and intraocular pressure (IOP) showed the quartiles for the anthropometric parameters BMI, fat mass/weight ratio and fat mass/muscle mass ratio were negatively associated with OAG.

Our rural study area included 28 contiguous villages from the district of Hooghly surrounding the rural base hospital located at Dhobapara in village Bakulia.
