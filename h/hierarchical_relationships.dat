25|$|Although Schenker himself usually {{presents}} his analyses in the generative direction, {{starting from}} the fundamental structure (Ursatz) to reach the score, the practice of Schenkerian analysis more often is reductive, {{starting from the}} score and showing {{how it can be}} reduced to its fundamental structure. The graph of the Ursatz is arrhythmic, as is a strict-counterpoint cantus firmus exercise. Even at intermediate levels of the reduction, rhythmic notation (open and closed noteheads, beams and flags) shows not rhythm but the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relationships</b> between the pitch-events. Schenkerian analysis is subjective. There is no mechanical procedure involved and the analysis reflects the musical intuitions of the analyst. The analysis represents a way of hearing (and reading) a piece of music.|$|E
25|$|Confucius judged a good ruler by his {{possession}} of de ("virtue"): {{a sort of}} moral force that allows those in power to rule and gain the loyalty of others {{without the need for}} physical coercion (Analects 2.1). Confucius said {{that one of the most}} important ways that a ruler cultivates his sense of de is through a devotion to the correct practices of li. Examples of rituals identified by Confucius as important to cultivate a ruler's de include: sacrificial rites held at ancestral temples to express thankfulness and humility; ceremonies of enfeoffment, toasting, and gift exchanges that bound nobility in complex <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relationships</b> of obligation and indebtedness; and, acts of formal politeness and decorum (i.e. bowing and yielding) that identify the performers as morally well-cultivated.|$|E

25|$|Schenkerian {{analysis}} {{is a method}} of musical analysis of tonal music based on the theories of Heinrich Schenker (1868–1935). The goal of a Schenkerian {{analysis is}} to interpret the underlying structure of a tonal work and to help reading the score according to that structure. The theory's basic tenets {{can be viewed as}} a way of defining tonality in music. A Schenkerian analysis of a passage of music shows <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relationships</b> among its pitches, and draws conclusions about the structure of the passage from this hierarchy. The analysis makes use of a specialized symbolic form of musical notation that Schenker devised to demonstrate various techniques of elaboration. The most fundamental concept of Schenker's theory of tonality may be that of tonal space. The intervals between the notes of the tonic triad form a tonal space that is filled with passing and neighbour notes, producing new triads and new tonal spaces, open for further elaborations until the surface of the work (the score) is reached.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a strong}} <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relationship</b> among {{different}} political/administrative levels of SDI concepts.

2500|$|The thawing of {{censorship}} in 1956–57 (known as the Hundred Flowers Campaign) {{and the early}} 1960s led to more indigenous Chinese films being made which were less reliant on their Soviet counterparts. During this campaign the sharpest criticisms came from the satirical comedies of Lü Ban. Before the New Director Arrives exposes the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relationships</b> occurring between the cadres, while his next film, The Unfinished Comedy (1957), was labelled as a [...] "poisonous weed" [...] during the Anti-Rightist Movement and Lü banned from directing for life.The Unfinished Comedy was only screened after Mao's death. Other noteworthy films produced during this period were adaptations of literary classics, such as Sang Hu's The New Year's Sacrifice (1956; adapted from a Lu Xun story) and Shui Hua's The Lin Family Shop (1959; adapted from a Mao Dun story). The most prominent filmmaker of this era was Xie Jin, whose three films in particular, Woman Basketball Player No. 5 (1957), The Red Detachment of Women (1961) and Two Stage Sisters (1964), exemplify China's increased expertise at filmmaking during this time. Films made during this period are polished and exhibit high production value and elaborate sets. While Beijing and Shanghai remained the main centers of production, between 1957–60 the government built regional studios in Guangzhou, Xi'an and Chengdu to encourage representations of ethnic minorities in films. Chinese cinema began to directly {{address the issue of}} such ethnic minorities during the late 1950s and early 1960s, in films like Five Golden Flowers (1959), Third Sister Liu (1960), Serfs (1963), Ashima (1964).|$|E
