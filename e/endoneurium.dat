2500|$|Neuroregeneration in the {{peripheral}} nervous system (PNS) occurs to a significant degree. Axonal sprouts form at the proximal stump and grow until they enter the distal stump. The growth of the sprouts is governed by chemotactic factors secreted from Schwann cells (neurolemmocytes). Injury to {{the peripheral}} nervous system immediately elicits the migration of phagocytes, Schwann cells, and macrophages to the lesion site in order to clear away debris such as damaged tissue. When a nerve axon is severed, the end still attached to the cell body is labeled the proximal segment, while the other end is called the [...] distal segment. After injury, the proximal end swells and experiences some retrograde degeneration, but once the debris is cleared, it begins to sprout axons {{and the presence of}} growth cones can be detected. The proximal axons are able to regrow as long as the cell body is intact, and they have made contact with the Schwann cells in the endoneurial channel or tube. Human axon growth rates can reach 1mm/day in small nerves and 5mm/day in large nerves. The distal segment, however, experiences Wallerian degeneration within hours of the injury; the axons and myelin degenerate, but the <b>endoneurium</b> remains. In the later stages of regeneration the remaining endoneurial tube directs axon growth back to the correct targets. During Wallerian degeneration, Schwann cells grow in ordered columns along the endoneurial tube, creating a band of Büngner (boB) that protects and preserves the endoneurial channel. Also, macrophages and Schwann cells release neurotrophic factors that enhance re-growth.|$|E
60|$|Section 103. Figure 7, Sheet 8, {{shows the}} typical {{structure}} of nervous tissues. The nerve fibres there figured are bound together by <b>endoneurium</b> into small ropes, the nerves, encased in perineurium. There {{is always a}} grey axis cylinder (a.c.), which may (in medullated nerves), or may not (in non-medullated or grey nerves) have a medullary sheath (s.S.) interrupted at intervals by the nodes of Ranvier (n.R.). Nuclei (n.) at intervals under the sheath indicate the cells from which nerve fibres are derived by a process of elongation. The nerves of invertebrata, where they possess nerves, are mostly grey, and so {{are those of the}} sympathetic system of vertebrata, to be presently described, g.c., g.c. are ganglion cells; they may have many hair-like processes, usually running into continuity with the axis cylinders of nerve fibres, in which case they are called multi-polar cells, or they may be uni- or bi-polar.|$|E
50|$|<b>Endoneurium.</b> Each nerve axon, or fiber is {{surrounded}} by the <b>endoneurium,</b> which is also called the endoneurial tube, channel or sheath. This is a thin, delicate, protective layer of connective tissue.|$|E
50|$|The <b>endoneurium,</b> perineurium, and the epineurium are intact.|$|E
5000|$|Neurotmesis: {{this type}} of injury {{involves}} the <b>endoneurium</b> with wallerian degeneration. Recovery is difficult.|$|E
50|$|It {{is a total}} {{severance}} or {{disruption of}} the entire nerve fiber.A peripheral nerve fiber contains an axon (Or long dendrite), myelin sheath (if existence), their schwann cells, and the <b>endoneurium.</b> Neurotmesis may be partial or complete.|$|E
50|$|Sunderland's third-degree is a {{nerve fiber}} interruption. In third-degree injury, {{there is a}} lesion of the <b>endoneurium,</b> but the epineurium and perineurium remain intact. Recovery from a third-degree injury is possible, but {{surgical}} intervention may be required.|$|E
50|$|Each nerve {{is covered}} {{externally}} by a dense sheath of connective tissue, the epineurium. Underlying {{this is a}} layer of flat cells, the perineurium, which forms a complete sleeve around a bundle of axons. Perineurial septae extend into the nerve and subdivide it into several bundles of fibres. Surrounding each such fibre is the <b>endoneurium.</b> This forms an unbroken tube {{from the surface of}} the spinal cord to the level where the axon synapses with its muscle fibres, or ends in sensory receptors. The <b>endoneurium</b> consists of an inner sleeve of material called the glycocalyx and an outer, delicate, meshwork of collagen fibres. Nerves are bundled along with blood vessels, since the neurons of a nerve have fairly high energy requirements.|$|E
50|$|Cryoneurolysis {{treatments}} which utilize {{liquid nitrogen}} (boiling point of -195.8 °C) as the coolant {{fall into the}} range of a neurotmesis injury, or 3rd degree injury according to the Sunderland classification. Treatments of the nerve in this temperature range are irreversible. Nerves treated in this temperature range experience a disruption of both the axon and the <b>endoneurium</b> connective tissue layer.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>endoneurium</b> {{contains}} a liquid known as endoneurial fluid, which contains little protein. In the {{peripheral nervous system}} the endoneurial fluid is notionally equivalent to cerebro-spinal fluid in the central nervous system. Peripheral nerve injuries commonly release increased amounts of endoneurial fluid into surrounding tissues; these can be detected by magnetic resonance neurography, thereby assisting in locating injuries to peripheral nerves.|$|E
50|$|Each nerve is a cordlike {{structure}} containing {{bundles of}} axons. Within a nerve, each axon {{is surrounded by}} a layer of connective tissue called the <b>endoneurium.</b> The axons are bundled together into groups called fascicles, and each fascicle is wrapped in a layer of connective tissue called the perineurium. Finally, the entire nerve is wrapped in a layer of connective tissue called the epineurium.|$|E
50|$|Each nerve is {{composed}} of a bundle of axons. Each axon is surrounded by the <b>endoneurium</b> connective tissue layer. These axons are bundled into fascicles which are surrounded by the perineurium connective tissue layer. Multiple fascicles are then surrounded by the epineurium, which is the outermost connective tissue layer of the nerve. The axons of myelinated nerves have a myelin sheath made up of Schwann cells that coat the axon.|$|E
50|$|Axonotmesis is {{an injury}} to the {{peripheral}} nerve {{of one of the}} extremities of the body. The axons and their myelin sheath are damaged in this kind of injury, but Schwann cells, the <b>endoneurium,</b> perineurium and epineurium remain intact. Motor and sensory functions distal to the point of injury are completely lost over time leading to Wallerian Degeneration due to ischemia, or loss of blood supply. Axonotmesis is usually the result of a more severe crush or contusion than neuropraxia.|$|E
50|$|An axon is {{the part}} of a neuron which conducts {{electrical}} impulses. Axons are surrounded by myelin, which contain Schwann cells. Schwann cells improve the electrical conduction. The myelin is surrounded by <b>endoneurium,</b> which is a protective sheath of connective tissue. This is surrounded by perineurium and epineurium, of which the latter is the outmost layer of dense connective tissue. When it comes to nerve repair, it is crucial that those layers make a good connection.|$|E
50|$|Neurotmesis: The {{most severe}} form of nerve injury, {{in which the}} nerve is {{completely}} disrupted by contusion, traction or laceration. Not only the axon, but the encapsulating connective tissue lose their continuity. The most extreme degree of neurotmesis is transsection, although most neurotmetic injuries do not produce gross loss of continuity of the nerve but rather, internal disruption of the nerve architecture sufficient to involve perineurium and <b>endoneurium</b> as well as axons and their covering. It requires surgery, with unpredictable recovery.|$|E
50|$|The {{optic nerve}} is ensheathed {{in all three}} meningeal layers (dura, arachnoid, and pia mater) rather than the epineurium, perineurium, and <b>endoneurium</b> found in {{peripheral}} nerves. Fiber tracts of the mammalian central nervous system (as opposed to the peripheral nervous system) are incapable of regeneration, and, hence, optic nerve damage produces irreversible blindness. The fibres from the retina run along the optic nerve to nine primary visual nuclei in the brain, from which a major relay inputs into the primary visual cortex.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>endoneurium</b> (also called endoneurial channel, endoneurial sheath, endoneurial tube, or Henle's sheath) is a {{layer of}} {{delicate}} connective tissue around the myelin sheath of each myelinated nerve fiber. Its component cells are called endoneurial cells. The endoneuria with their enclosed nerve fibers are bundled into groups called nerve fascicles, each fascicle within its own protective sheath called a perineurium. In sufficiently large nerves multiple fascicles, each with its blood supply and fatty tissue, may be bundled within yet another sheath, the epineurium.|$|E
50|$|The <b>endoneurium</b> runs {{longitudinally}} {{along the}} nerve fiber, but with discontinuities where septa pass inward from the innermost {{layer of the}} perineurium. It contains fine bundles of fibrous connective tissue, primarily collagen, embedded in a matrix of ground substance. This structure serves to support capillary blood vessels, arranged so as to form a network of elongated meshes. Similar structures occur around some nervous components elsewhere in the body, for example around the Schwann cells on the peripheral side of the transitional zone on the auditory nerve.|$|E
50|$|In the {{peripheral}} nervous system, the myelin sheath of each axon in a nerve is {{wrapped in a}} delicate protective sheath known as the <b>endoneurium.</b> Within the nerve, axons targeting the same anatomical location are bundled together into groups known as fascicles, each surrounded by another protective sheath known as the perineurium. Several fascicles may be in turn bundled together with a blood supply and fatty tissue within yet another sheath, the epineurium. This grouping structure {{is analogous to the}} muscular organization system of epimysium, perimysium and endomysium.|$|E
50|$|This fibrous {{connective}} tissue interpenetrates and surrounds the muscles, bones, nerves and blood vessels of the body. It provides connection and communication {{in the form of}} aponeuroses, ligaments, tendons, retinacula, joint capsules, and septa. The deep fasciae envelop all bone (periosteum and endosteum); cartilage (perichondrium), and blood vessels (tunica externa) and become specialized in muscles (epimysium, perimysium, and endomysium) and nerves (epineurium, perineurium, and <b>endoneurium).</b> The high density of collagen fibers is what gives the deep fascia its strength and integrity. The amount of elastin fiber determines how much extensibility and resilience it will have.|$|E
50|$|Within the <b>endoneurium,</b> the {{individual}} nerve fibres {{are surrounded by}} a low-protein liquid called endoneurial fluid. This acts {{in a similar way}} to the cerebrospinal fluid in the central nervous system and constitutes a blood-nerve barrier similar to the blood-brain barrier. Molecules are thereby prevented from crossing the blood into the endoneurial fluid. During the development of nerve edema from nerve irritation or (injury), the amount of endoneurial fluid may increase at the site of irritation. This increase in fluid can be visualized using magnetic resonance neurography, and thus MR neurography can identify nerve irritation and/or injury.|$|E
50|$|Neurotmesis {{occurs in}} the {{peripheral}} nervous system and most often in the upper-limb (arms), accounting for 73.5% of all peripheral nerve injury cases. Of these cases, the ulnar nerve was most often injured. Peripheral nerves are structured so that the axons are surrounded by most often a myelinated sheath and then an <b>endoneurium.</b> A perineurium surrounds that and the outermost layer is considered the epineurium. When injury occurs, “local vascular trauma leads to hemorrhage and edema (swelling), which results in vigorous inflammatory response resulting in scarring of the injured segment. In most cases, due to the extreme nature of the injury, there is typically complete loss of function.|$|E
5000|$|Cryoneurolysis {{treatments}} which utilize {{nitrous oxide}} (boiling point of -88.5 °C) as the coolant {{fall in the}} range of an axonotmesis injury, or 2nd degree injury according to the Sunderland classification system. Treatments of the nerve in this temperature range are reversible. Nerves treated in this temperature range experience a disruption of the axon, with Wallerian degeneration occurring distal to the site of injury. [...] The axon and myelin sheath are affected, but all of the connective tissues (<b>endoneurium,</b> perineurium, and epineurium) remain intact. Following Wallerian degeneration the axon regenerates along the original nerve path at a rate of approximately 1-2 mm per day.|$|E
50|$|Neurotmesis is {{the most}} severe lesion with no {{potential}} of full recovery. It occurs on severe contusion, stretch, laceration, or Local Anesthetic Toxicity. The axon and encapsulating connective tissue lose their continuity. The last (extreme) degree of neurotmesis is transsection, but most neurotmetic injuries do not produce gross loss of continuity of the nerve but rather internal disruption of {{the architecture of the}} nerve sufficient to involve perineurium and <b>endoneurium</b> as well as axons and their covering. Denervation changes recorded by EMG are the same as those seen with axonotmetic injury. There is a complete loss of motor, sensory and autonomic function. If the nerve has been completely divided, axonal regeneration causes a neuroma to form in the proximal stump. For neurotmesis, it is better to use a new more complete classification called the Sunderland System.|$|E
5000|$|Tarlov cysts {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{located in the}} S1 to S4/S5 region of the spinal canal, but can be found along any region of the spine. They usually form on the extradural components of sacrococcygeal nerve roots at the junction of dorsal root ganglion and posterior nerve roots and arise between the <b>endoneurium</b> and perineurium. Occasionally, these cysts are observed in the lumbar and thoracic spine. However, these cysts most commonly arise at the S2 or S3 junction of the dorsal nerve root ganglion. The cysts are often multiple, extending around the circumference of the nerve, and can enlarge over time to compress neighboring nerve roots, to cause bone erosion. [...] The cysts may be found anterior to the sacral area and {{have been known to}} extend into the abdominal cavity. These cysts, though rare, can be found to grow large - over 3 - 4 cm in size, often causing severe abdominal pain from compression on the cyst itself as well as adjoining nerves.|$|E
50|$|Skeletal {{muscles are}} {{sheathed}} by a tough layer of connective tissue called the epimysium. The epimysium anchors muscle tissue to tendons at each end, where the epimysium becomes thicker and collagenous. It also protects muscles from friction against other muscles and bones. Within the epimysium are multiple bundles called fascicles, {{each of which}} contains 10 to 100 or more muscle fibers collectively sheathed by a perimysium. Besides surrounding each fascicle, the perimysium is a pathway for nerves and {{the flow of blood}} within the muscle. The threadlike muscle fibers are the individual muscle cells (myocytes), and each cell is encased within its own endomysium of collagen fibers. Thus, the overall muscle consists of fibers (cells) that are bundled into fascicles, which are themselves grouped together to form muscles. At each level of bundling, a collagenous membrane surrounds the bundle, and these membranes support muscle function both by resisting passive stretching of the tissue and by distributing forces applied to the muscle. Scattered throughout the muscles are muscle spindles that provide sensory feedback information to the central nervous system. (This grouping structure is analogous to the organization of nerves which uses epineurium, perineurium, and <b>endoneurium).</b>|$|E

40|$|After {{years of}} {{investigation}} into blood-nervous tissue barriers controversies remain regarding the permeability {{of blood vessels}} to macromolecules in the enteric nervous system, the <b>endoneurium</b> of peripheral nerve, and the spaces between satellite cells and neurons in sensory and sympathetic ganglia.;The permeability of the above areas of the peripheral nervous system was investigated in rats using the following intravenously administered tracers: rhodamine-labelled bovine albumin; horseradish peroxidase; acriflavine and ethidium. The last two, which are fluorescent cationic dyes were shown to bind to serum proteins. In addition immunohistochemical staining for endogenous albumin was performed. One long-term study was done in which rhodamine-labelled bovine albumin was injected subcutaneously, once daily, for one week. With all these methods, {{it was possible to}} show that blood vessels in the brain were impermeable, whereas those in circumventricular organs were permeable, thus validating their application to regions in which the existence of permeable vessels was questionable.;Rhodamine-labelled bovine albumin was seen in all the extracellular spaces in sympathetic and sensory ganglia, even after short times in the circulation. The <b>endoneurium</b> of peripheral nerve contained this tracer only in rats in which it had been injected daily for one week. At no time did this fluorescent albumin enter the enteric ganglia. Positive immunohistochemical staining for endogenous albumin was present in the enteric nervous system, in the <b>endoneurium</b> of peripheral nerve, in the spaces between satellite cells and neurons in sensory ganglia, and around neurons in sympathetic ganglia. Horseradish peroxidase, which is present in the blood for about 5 minutes following intravenous injection, penetrated the enteric nervous system, and the extracellular spaces between satellite cells and neurons in sensory ganglia, but it did not enter the <b>endoneurium</b> of peripheral nerve. The fluorochromes acriflavine and ethidium entered enteric, sympathetic and sensory ganglia, but not the <b>endoneurium</b> of peripheral nerve.;In conclusion, the enteric nervous system, sympathetic and sensory ganglia are permeable to most circulating macromolecules. The <b>endoneurium</b> of peripheral nerve is permeable only to macromolecules that are present in the circulation for at least one week, so the transudation or diffusion in this tissue must occur more slowly than elsewhere. These permeabilities may explain how some pathogens enter the nervous system...|$|E

40|$|In fifty-seven resting nerve fibers of {{the squid}} Sepioteuthis sepioidea impaled from outside to inside, three {{potential}} difference (PD) levels were recorded. In twelve nerve fibers {{the position of}} the tip of the micropipette, when it was recording one of the PD levels, was labeled with carmine, and the minute spot of dye was localized histologically. The first PD level of - 10 to - 26 mv, was located in the <b>endoneurium</b> cells; the second level, formed by a single PD of - 33 to - 46 mv, was located in the Schwann cell; and the third level, formed by a single PD of - 50 to - 65 mv, was located in the axon. In sixteen nerve fibers the independence among these PD levels was demonstrated as follows. One micropipette was inserted inside the axon for recording its PD; a second one was inserted inside one <b>endoneurium</b> cell or inside one Schwann cell for recording the PD; and a third micropipette was inserted inside the axon to supply current to depolarize the axon. When the axon was depolarized no significant change was observed in the PD of either the <b>endoneurium</b> cell or the Schwann cell.

40|$|Abstract. A 2 -year-old, male Japanese native fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus) was {{presented}} with an inability to feed and torticollis. At a necropsy, there were cylindrical enlargements and yellow discoloration of multiple peripheral nerves, including nerves of the lumbosacral plexus, brachial plexus, and spinal ganglia. On histologic examination, these lesions consisted of diffuse proliferations of spindle cells with characteristic onion bulb–like structures around residual axons. The spindle cells were immunohistochemically positive for glucose transporter 1 (GLUT 1) and negative for S- 100 a/b proteins. On the basis of microscopic, histologic, and immunohistochemical findings, the tumors were diagnosed as multiple perineuriomas.

40|$|This study aims {{to observe}} the process of myelin loss and repair {{following}} the injection of the gliotoxic agent ethidium bromide (EB) in the sciatic nerve of rats previously induced to diabetes mellitus by streptozotocin. Injection of EB was also done in non-diabetic rats. The animals were euthanatized from 3 to 31 days after intraneural injection and nerve sections were collected for ultrastructural study. In non-diabetic rats, Schwann cells (CS) showed signs of intoxication 3 days after, with cytoplasmic vacuolization and rejection of their myelin sheaths. Myelin debris were removed by macrophages in the <b>endoneurium</b> and mast cells were abundant in the lesions. From 14 days following EB injection, supernumerary CS were seen in the expanded <b>endoneurium</b> as well as thin myelin sheaths indicating remyelination.

40|$|Severe edema in the <b>endoneurium</b> {{can occur}} after non-freezing cold {{injury to the}} {{peripheral}} nerve, which suggests damage to the blood-nerve barrier. To {{determine the effects of}} cold injury on the blood-nerve barrier, the sciatic nerve on one side of Wistar rats was treated with low temperatures (3 - 5 °C) for 2 hours. The contralateral sciatic nerve was used as a control. We assessed changes in the nerves using Evans blue as a fluid tracer and morphological methods. Excess fluid was found in the <b>endoneurium</b> 1 day after cold injury, though the tight junctions between cells remained closed. From 3 to 5 days after the cold injury, the fluid was still present, but the tight junctions were open. Less tracer leakage was found from 3 to 5 days after the cold injury compared with 1 day after injury. The cold injury resulted in a breakdown of the blood-nerve barrier function, which caused endoneurial edema. However, during the early period, the breakdown of the blood-nerve barrier did not include the opening of tight junctions, but was due to other factors. Excessive fluid volume produced a large increase in the endoneurial fluid pressure, prevented liquid penetration into the <b>endoneurium</b> from the microvasculature. These results suggest that drug treatment to patients with cold injuries should be administered during the early period after injury because it may be more difficult for the drug to reach the injury site through the microcirculation after the tissue fluid pressure becomes elevated...|$|E

40|$|Tissue-engineered {{bridging}} {{devices for}} surgical implantation into {{peripheral nerve injury}} sites could provide an attractive alternative to the nerve autograft. Here we report {{the development of an}} aligned cellular conduit which mimics key cellular and extracellular features of the autograft <b>endoneurium.</b> Previous work from our group has shown that aligned Schwann cells within a tethered collagen gel can promote and guide neuron regeneration in vitro and in vivo. Combining this cellular alignment with plastic compression to stabilise collagen gels produces a robust cellular biomaterial with the potential to form nerve repair conduits to enhance neuronal growth and provide a directional cue to regenerating neurons. Experiments using cell death assays, immunostaining and confocal microscopy show that Schwann cells in collagen gels survive plastic compression and also maintain their alignment following the compression process to form an aligned cellular collagen biomaterial. We have also demonstrated that dissociated DRG neurons growing on the surface of these aligned cellular sheets extend aligned neurites that appear guided by the orientation of the aligned Schwann cells. Rolling the flat sheets of aligned Schwann cells into columns provides a means to engineer fibers of aligned cells embedded within a robust collagen extracellular matrix. These engineered columns of aligned Schwann cells can then be packed together to form the <b>endoneurium</b> of a peripheral nerve repair device. In vitro testing of the engineered <b>endoneurium</b> within a silicone outer tube shows that neuronal growth is supported by this device, which has the potential to form an implantable conduit for peripheral nerve repair. ...|$|E
