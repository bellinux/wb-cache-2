40|$|Aims: This article {{examines}} <b>invisible</b> <b>work</b> tasks {{in the work}} organizations of call centres. The aim is to analyze what kinds of <b>invisible</b> <b>work</b> tasks there are and, moreover, {{to find out how}} these arrangements are divided according to employees’ gender and position in the work organization. Study Design: The empirical evidence is based on ethnographic research in three call centre organizations in Finland. The semi-structured interviews were the main research technique in the field. Researchers have only seldom focused on <b>invisible</b> <b>work</b> tasks as the starting point of analysis, even though this could give otherwise unattainable insights into the ways in which work at large is organized, especially in relation to gender. Conclusion: The analysis indicates that the <b>invisible</b> <b>work</b> tasks in call centres mostly follow the same gendered pattern as the formal work task...|$|E

40|$|Although {{patients}} are often absent in discourses on telemedicine, many telemonitoring applications constitute a new medical practice in which {{patients are}} expected to play an active role. The paper {{is based on a}} study of the use of one specific telemonitoring device, an ambulatory ECG recorder introduced to diagnose infrequent irregularities of the heart rhythm. It seeks to examine all the <b>invisible</b> <b>work</b> it takes to produce patients who are active and responsible as participants in the diagnosis of their heart problem. In particular, I address the question of how we can understand that individuals who are anxious about their heart function manage to adopt the role of ‘diagnostic agent’. This research shows that, although many patients managed to become competent users of the new technology, there are important patterns of selective use patients invented to integrate the technology in their daily life. In conclusion, the paper suggests that most patients were able to adopt the role of diagnostic agent not only because of their individual motivation but because of their location in the socio-technical network of this technology, in which the <b>invisible</b> <b>work</b> of home-care nurses and physicians at the telemedical centre made all the difference...|$|E

40|$|Visible persons, <b>invisible</b> <b>work?</b> Exploring {{articulation}} work in {{the implementation}} of person-centred care on a hospital ward Recently, many initiatives promoting a holistic view of the patient have been developed. In the last 20 years, different models and frameworks have been advanced to operationalize these different forms of holistic care. This article focuses on one specific case of holistic person-centred care, using the sociological theories of articulation work and <b>invisible</b> <b>work</b> to investigate the efforts involved in sustaining its realization. The article builds on a small ethnographic study conducted at a ward in a Swedish hospital implementing person-centred care. Following a nurse, and her patient, through a ‘person-centred’ admission process and its subsequent procedures, it is argued that person-centred care depends on nurses performing many new tasks which are rarely recognized and appreciated. Secondly, it is argued that nurses are continually asked to do what Anselm Strauss defined as articulation work, coordinating between these different new tasks and established duties. Thirdly, the article discusses the tensions arising when implementing a formalized model of care, which builds on a critique of standardization and objectification, and the work that is excluded and invisible in such routinized operationalization. Finally, it is concluded that while the successful implementation of person-centred care is often argued to rely on the willingness of nurses to surrender old habits, it seems rather to hinge on the skilled inventiveness of these nurses and their ability to overcome the practical difficulties they encounter.

40|$|This chapter {{develops}} a conceptual approach which understands sentencing {{as a collective}} practice which is generated {{by a number of}} actors, not only judges. Sentencing is seen as a series of decision making practices which are made visible in publicly available accounts. This way of seeing sentencing has significant implications for understanding conventional accounts of discretion. This chapter argues that discretion is best understood as a mode of justification based on trust in the <b>invisible</b> <b>work</b> of actors. Sentencing guidelines add a more visible, rule –based form of accountability which does not replace discretion but works alongside it as a complementary mode of justification...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this {{communication}} I {{question the}} contrast between the image of data as primary material that can seamlessly flow {{from one place to another}} and the work that such circulation takes behind-the-scenes, the frictions the data engender, their fragility, and their cost.

At the same time, he also warns us that caring for difference is a struggle that includes making radical cuts and disconnections, and in practice often may build on precarious and <b>invisible</b> <b>work.</b> This leads him to asks what academic institutions would look like that could value and cultivate that which they cannot evaluate...|$|E

In this article I will, through Donna Haraway’s way of conceptualizing discourses, analyze what I call “stories without significance”. I have mapped the stories and interpretations women undergoing reconstruction make, stories that are not becoming part of the monovocal discourse of breast reconstruction.

The article is also an effort to account for some of the <b>invisible</b> <b>work</b> that goes into the process of breast reconstruction in dialogue with the feminist STS field.

I outline the boundaries that characterize current relations of development and use, and the boundary crossings required to transform them. Three contrasting positions for design – the view from nowhere, detached intimacy, and located accountability – are discussed as alternative bases for a politics of professional design practice. From the position of located accountability, I close by sketching aspects of what a feminist politics and associated practices of technology production could be...|$|E

To what extent can an economy predicated on data and value transfer from the Global South to the North be construed as “neocolonial”? Theoretical parallels with slavery, imperialism, and colonization fail to assess the historical uniqueness of new global inequalities. This article claims that the germane notion of “coloniality” (by relating to existing works {{at the intersection of}} race, gender, postcolonial, and subaltern studies) better addresses the dynamics of social exclusion and exploitation at play in Western and non-Western countries.
