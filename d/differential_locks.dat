2500|$|On the A0 {{model the}} front Rockwell steer-drive axle has Hendrickson {{parabolic}} taper leaf springs. The rear tridem unit is sprung by Hendrickson-Turner air suspension. The rearmost axle is a steer-drive unit. All axles are Rockwell SVI 5MR hub-reduction with <b>differential</b> <b>locks.</b> Steering is power-assisted, {{and has an}} auxiliary pump should the main pump fail. Mechanical linkage also provides operator control in event of hydraulic oil pressure loss. [...] Rockwell (now AxleTech) S-cam drum brakes are fitted. A CM Automotive central tire inflation system (CTIS) is fitted, this having four predetermined terrain settings (Highway, Cross-Country, Mud & Snow, Emergency) that enable the operator to adjust tire pressure and lock-up to suit the terrain being crossed. A Run Flat mode checks tire pressures regularly and inflates as needed to compensate for leak(s).|$|E

5000|$|A <b>locking</b> <b>differential,</b> <b>differential</b> <b>lock,</b> {{diff lock}} or locker is a {{variation}} on the standard automotive <b>differential.</b> A <b>locking</b> <b>differential</b> may provide increased traction compared to a standard, or [...] "open" [...] differential by restricting each of the two wheels on an axle to the same rotational speed without regard to available traction or differences in resistance seen at each wheel.|$|R
5000|$|The {{provision}} of both {{front and rear}} <b>differential</b> <b>locks</b> enables the vehicle to make progress even if only one wheel is in firm contact with the ground.|$|E
50|$|The car’s braking {{technology}} features four-wheel EDS (electronic <b>differential</b> <b>locks</b> on both axles) and XDS (expanded electronic differential lock), the ESC electronic {{stability programme}} and the multi-collision brake.|$|E

50|$|Note: The {{electronic}} <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> (EDL) {{employed by}} Volkswagen is not — {{as the name}} suggests — a <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> at all. Sensors monitor wheel speeds, and if one is rotating substantially faster than the other (i.e., slipping), the EDL system momentarily brakes it. This effectively transfers all the power to the other wheel.|$|R
50|$|An On&Off Road Package is {{available}} for most markets (now including North America) as of the 2013 model year. The package adds a two-speed dual range Magna Powertrain transfer case with center <b>differential</b> <b>lock,</b> reduction gearing, underbody skid plates, and a 6-mode selectable terrain driving program system. The rear <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> has been discontinued.|$|R
50|$|The {{electronic}} <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> (EDL) {{employed by}} Volkswagen is not, {{as the name}} suggests, a <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> at all. Sensors monitor roadwheel speeds across an individual driven axle, and if one wheel is rotating substantially faster than the other (i.e. slipping) the EDL system momentarily brakes it. This effectively transfers power to the other wheel.|$|R
50|$|A 4X4 {{version of}} the LT was also produced. Volkswagen had already {{prepared}} for this in 1983 with the cab facelift, which incorporated instrumentation lights for front, centre and rear <b>differential</b> <b>locks.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{electronic}} <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> (EDL) {{employed by}} Volkswagen is not - {{as the name}} suggests - a <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> at all. Sensors monitor both roadwheel speeds across a driven axle, and if one is rotating substantially faster than the other (i.e. slipping) the EDL system momentarily brakes it. This effectively transfers the torque to the other driven wheel which is deemed to still have grip.|$|R
50|$|The Unimog 401 has a Daimler-Benz {{six-speed}} constant-mesh gearbox {{with two}} additional reverse gears. It has a clutch-independent switchable all-wheel drive and <b>differential</b> <b>locks</b> {{for the front}} and rear axle. The clutch is a Fichtel & Sachs single-disc-dry-clutch. Daimler-Benz offered an additional two-speed crawler-gearbox as a factory option.|$|E

5000|$|Four-wheel {{electronic}} {{traction control}} (ABS braking) is employed to simulate {{front and rear}} <b>differential</b> <b>locks</b> via aggressively [...] "brake locking" [...] the front or rear differentials, transferring up to 100 percent of torque from side-to-side. In the right conditions, the Explorer can keep moving even if only one wheel has traction, regardless of which wheel it is.|$|E
50|$|The {{drivetrain}} features Steyr’s Automatic Drivetrain Management (ADM). ADM automatically {{controls and}} monitors longitudinal and cross-axle <b>differential</b> <b>locks,</b> thereby reducing {{strain on the}} driver, with full drivetrain lock-up possible for maximum traction. RMMV literature states ADM offers advantages that include shorter driver training, longer service and maintenance intervals, prevention of damage by driver error or mistake, and longer tyre life.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "vacuum Servo" [...] can {{sometimes}} be mis-translated in vehicle engineering terms, to [...] "vacuum operated valve" [...] whereby a device is controlled either switched or proportionally {{by the use of}} a Vacuum.

40|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>lock</b> is a {{means of}} {{improving}} tractor performance. This system causes the revolution of the axles to become equal. It, improves traction, decreases abrasion of drive tires, improves fuel consumption, and increases tractor work rate. Despite advantages of the system, <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> has not been optimized in Iran. Thus, a semi-automatic <b>differential</b> <b>lock</b> system for MF- 285 tractor was designed and developed. First of all, the different parts of the system were designed, selected, assembled. Under critical conditions, the designed system should disengage the <b>differential</b> <b>lock.</b> Critical conditions for engaging this system are: using of independent brake pedals, high forward speed, and turning the steering wheel. For sensing and measuring the critical conditions, proper sensors were selected. Output signals of these sensors were sent to a micro controller to decide the continuous engaging or disengaging. Finally, a MF- 285 tractor was equipped with the designed system. The tractor performance in primary tillage was evaluated using a mounted moldboard plow with a width of 110 cm and a working depth of 25 cm. These tests showed that unbalanced weight distribution on wheels and unequal traction capacity under drive wheels cause the slip of one wheel to be 6 percent higher thananother. This system improves the unequal slip problem and decreases fuel consumption by 0. 5 L/ha...|$|R
