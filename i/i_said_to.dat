5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's really hard to play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I {{found it hard to}} make anything of that. In the end I felt the only thing I could do was to make it as hyper real as I could. I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E
5|$|None of them played instruments, so I {{was left}} to do the music and get that vibe together. What <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> them was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'. And I'd sing them the chorus and the melody—no lyrics or anything—and {{straight}} away five pencils and pads came out and they were throwing lines at us. Ten minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much {{it was a real}} quick process. They were confident in what they were doing, throwing it out there.|$|E
5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, {{you began to}} cry, because you could not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E

25|$|Emin {{has often}} {{made use of}} found objects in her work from the early use of a {{cigarette}} box found {{in a car crash}} in which her uncle died. The most well known example is My Bed, where she displayed her bed. Another instance is the removal of her beach hut from Whitstable to be displayed in a gallery. This work was titled The Last Thing <b>I</b> <b>Said</b> <b>To</b> You Is Don't Leave Me Here (The Hut) (1999).|$|E
25|$|When I {{became a}} member of the law firm of Steger, Thurmond and Rayburn, Messrs. Thurmond and Steger were {{representing}} the Santa Fe Railroad Company, receiving pay monthly. When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> him that I was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E

[...] When I told George and Ringo I'd agreed to that they were going, [...] "What? What if we love it?" [...] It didn't come to that, luckily. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Yoko, [...] "Don't impose too many conditions on us, it's really difficult to do this, spiritually. We don't know, we may hate each other after two hours in the studio and just walk out. So don't put any conditions, it's tough enough." ...|$|E
500|$|.....I {{thought about}} what I had been offered and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> myself, [...] "What am I being so damn grand about? I have two {{children}} to support, the part {{they want me to}} play has a lot of dignity, the show is already on the air, I wouldn't have to film a pilot, and they have a sponsor. This is really a great gift that has been offered me. I'd be stupid not to at least look into it." ...|$|E

Houchen later said that [...] "it {{was the only time}} I ever gave up... it wasn't the right club because it wasn't going anywhere... <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Yvonne, 'I'm just going to take the money'". In doing so he rejected moves to Preston North End and Third Division Bury.

[...] Geri Halliwell commented: [...] "I found it a bit bizarre bringing my mum to work with me on the 'Mama' video. You know: 'This is what I do—come and do it, too.'
