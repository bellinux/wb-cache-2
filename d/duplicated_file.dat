5000|$|... fdupes is {{a program}} written by Adrián López to scan {{directories}} for <b>duplicate</b> <b>files,</b> with options to list, delete or replace the files with hardlinks pointing to the duplicate.

5000|$|Source {{deduplication}} {{ensures that}} {{data on the}} data source is deduplicated. This generally takes place directly within a file system. [...] The file system will periodically scan new files creating hashes and compare them to hashes of existing files. When files with same hashes are found then the file copy is removed and the new file points to the old file. Unlike hard links however, <b>duplicated</b> <b>files</b> {{are considered to be}} separate entities and if one of the <b>duplicated</b> <b>files</b> is later modified, then using a system called copy-on-write a copy of that file or changed block is created. The deduplication process is transparent to the users and backup applications. Backing up a deduplicated file system will often cause duplication to occur resulting in the backups being bigger than the source data.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Duplicate</b> <b>file</b> names {{within a}} {{directory}} are not acceptable, since this would break applications' expectations {{of how a}} Unix file system works. Putting a logical, stack-like precedence ordering on the union's constituents partially solves this problem, but requires memory to record which files need to be skipped over during a directory listing (which is otherwise a nearly stateless operation).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To deduplicate the {{sensitive}} {{data in a}} cloud storage center, a scheme called as MHT-Dedup {{that is based on}} MHT (Merkle Hash Tree) is proposed. It achieves the cross-user file-level client-side deduplication and local block-level client-side deduplication concurrently. It firstly encrypts the file on block granularity, and then authenticates the file ciphertext to find <b>duplicated</b> <b>files</b> (Proofs of oWnership, PoW) and check the hash of block plaintext to find duplicated blocks. In the PoW protocol of MHT-Dedup, an authenticating binary tree is generated from the tags of encrypted blocks to assuredly find the <b>duplicated</b> <b>files.</b> MHT-Dedup gets rid of the conflict between data deduplication and encryption, achieves the file-level and block-level deduplication concurrently, avoids the misuse of storage system by users, resists to the inside and outside attacks to data confidentiality, and prevents the target collision attack to files and brute force attack to blocks...|$|R
25|$|The {{commands}} themselves could {{sometimes be}} obscure. For instance, the command to <b>duplicate</b> <b>files</b> was named PIP (Peripheral-Interchange-Program), {{the name of}} the old DEC utility used for that purpose. The format of parameters given to a program was not standardized, so that there was no single option character that differentiated options from file names. Different programs could and did use different characters.|$|R

This paper {{proposes a}} {{strategy}} of improving file availability of peer-to-peer file storage systems, which provides the ability of identifying <b>duplicate</b> <b>files</b> and leveraging the duplicates. Our mechanism includes 1) strategy of building indexes for files to be stored in the system, 2) method to automatically identify identical files and policy to merge the indexes, and 3) comparison to former work and evaluations of this mechanism. ...|$|R
5000|$|... freedup is {{a program}} to scan {{directories}} or <b>file</b> lists for <b>duplicate</b> <b>files.</b> The file lists may be provided to an input pipe or internally generated using find with provided options. There are more options to specify the search conditions more detailed. Other options influence the performed actions, i.e. whether to display only or to specify what kind of link under which circumstances. freedup first compares file sizes, then on equal sizes the MD5 signatures, and before taking actions a byte-by-byte check for verification is performed. An interactive mode allows to decide individually which files to link soft or hard or to delete.|$|R

A presentation on [...] "Unified Code Count with Differencing Functionality" [...] was presented in the 24th International Forum on COCOMO in October 2009.|$|R

In addition, the program's user interface (including icons and color scheme) can be customized.|$|R
5000|$|Convergent encryption, {{also known}} as content hash keying, is a {{cryptosystem}} that produces identical ciphertext from identical plaintext files.
