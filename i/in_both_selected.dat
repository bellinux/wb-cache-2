40|$|The interval-mapping {{procedure}} of Fulker and Cardon {{for analysis of}} a quantitative-trait loci (QTL) is extended for application to selected samples of sib pairs. Phenotypic selection of sib pairs, which is known to yield striking increases in power when a single marker is used, provides further increases in power when the interval-mapping approach is used. The greatest benefits of the combined approach are apparent with coarse maps, where QTLs of relatively modest (15 %- 20 %) heritability can be detected with widely spaced markers (40 - 60 cM apart) in reasonably sized sibling samples. Useful information concerning QTL location is afforded by interval mapping <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>selected</b> and unselected samples...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{fluorescent}} compounds rhodamine 123, LysoTracker Green DMD- 26, mitoxantrone, and BODIPY-prazosin {{were used}} with the antagonist fumitremorgin C (FTC) {{in order to develop}} functional assays for the half-transporter, MXR/BCRP/ABCP 1. A measure of FTC-inhibitable efflux was generated for each compound in a series of MXR-overexpressing drug-selected cell lines and in ten unselected cell lines which were used to determine if the four fluorescent compounds were sensitive enough to detect the low MXR levels found in drug-sensitive cell lines. FTC-inhibitable efflux of mitoxantrone and prazosin was found in four of the ten cell lines, SF 295, KM 12, NCI-H 460, and A 549, and low but detectable levels of MXR mRNA were also observed by Northern analysis in these cells. FTC-inhibitable mitoxantrone and prazosin efflux <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>selected</b> and unselected cell lines was found to correlate well with MXR levels as determined by Northern blotting, r 2 = 0. 89 and r 2 = 0. 70 respectively. In contrast, rhodamine and LysoTracker were not able to reliably detect MXR. Cytotoxicity assays performed on two of the four unselected cell lines confirmed increased sensitivity to mitoxantrone in the presence of FTC. FTC was found to be a specific inhibitor of MXR, with half-maximal inhibition of MXR-associated ATPase activity at 1 μM FTC. Short term selections of the SF 295, KM 12, NCI-H 460 and A 549 cell lines in mitoxantrone resulted in a small but measurable increase in MXR by both Northern blot and functional assay. These studies show that flow cytometric measurement of FTC-inhibitable mitoxantrone or prazosin efflux is a sensitive and specific method for measuring the function of the MXR half-transporter <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>selected</b> and unselected cell lines...|$|E

In the high line, recombination between Gl and Sb was increased from 14. 8 percent to about 30 percent in twelve generations, when a plateau was apparently reached. Realized heritability was 0. 12. The absence of a response to selection for low recombination is attributed mainly to genetic random drift, and partially to directional dominance and directional gene frequencies.

40|$|Background Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive congenital bleeding disorder with deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF).

Linkage analyses of 112 selected sib pairs, in which one or more members had trait values exceeding the disease threshold, were compared with analyses of the total unselected sib-pair sample (771 pairs). Selected sample regression models yielded comparable significance levels to those obtained from the unselected sample at most loci on the six simulated chromosomes, demonstrating the efficiency of selected sib-pair analysis for quantitative characters. Two of the three disease QTLs were detected <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>selected</b> and unselected samples.

40|$|Above-ground biomass {{estimation}} of successional and mature forests in moist tropical regions is attracting increasing attention. Because of complex stand structure and abundant vegetation species, rarely has remote-sensing research been successfully conducted in biomass estimation for moist tropical areas. In this paper, two study {{areas in the}} Brazilian Amazon basin—Altamira and Bragantina — with different biophysical characteristics were selected. Atmospherically corrected Thematic Mapper (TM) images and field vegetation inventory data {{were used in the}} analysis, and different vegetation indices and texture measures were explored.

40|$|Spectral feature {{selection}} identifies relevant features by measuring their capability of preserving sample similarity. It provides a powerful framework for both supervised and unsupervised {{feature selection}}, {{and has been}} proven {{to be effective in}} many real-world applications. One common drawback associated with most existing spectral feature selection algorithms is that they evaluate features individually and cannot identify redundant features. Since redundant features can have significant adverse effect on learning performance, it is necessary to address this limitation for spectral feature selection. To this end, we propose a novel spectral feature selection algorithm to handle feature redundancy, adopting an embedded model. The algorithm is derived from a formulation based on a sparse multi-output regression with a L 2, 1 -norm constraint. We conduct theoretical analysis on the properties of its optimal solutions, paving the way for designing an efficient path-following solver. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm can do well <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>selecting</b> relevant features and removing redundancy...|$|R

Changes in mortality levels have been associated with the implementation of relevant preventive programs. The development of mortality is analyzed according to age only for female population and causes of death using the standardized mortality rate of selected causes of death and age specific mortality rate and using the decomposition of life expectancy at birth between the years 1994 - 2001 and 2009 - 2015 in terms of age groups and causes of death.

Selecting video clips to use in professional development is a new task for most facilitators and requires specialized knowledge—knowledge of both the general affordances of video for teacher learning, {{as well as the}} specific affordances of particular videos. The articles in this special issue make an important contribution by elaborating what this work involves. Tekkumru-Kisa and Stein (2017), for example, emphasize the important role that facilitators play <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>selecting</b> and sequencing video clips prior to implementation in the TSCD-PD. They explain that the facilitator must consider how to organize video-clips “across the PD program by considering the trajectory of ideas that will be advanced” (p. 6). In particular, video clips should be purposefully sequenced in order to foster teachers’ “sensing, surfacing, and labeling of instructional factors that help teachers to maintain high-levels of student thinking” (p. 7). Thus, clip selection involves learning to identify videos that can help teachers develop each of these skills, as well as organizing the videos so that teachers build these skills over time.|$|R
