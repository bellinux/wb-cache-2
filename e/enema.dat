50|$|<b>Enemas</b> {{may be used}} as part of BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism, and masochism) activities, or as {{a regular}} sexual {{activity}} for an individual or between partners. <b>Enemas</b> can be pleasurable to either sex, and in males enemas can stimulate the prostate gland. Unexpected erections are common in medical settings, even if the person finds it an unpleasant procedure.|$|R
50|$|<b>Enemas</b> {{are used}} as part of some {{alternative}} health therapies and are also used to administer drugs for recreational or religious reasons.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Enemas</b> {{have been}} used {{around the time of}} {{childbirth}} however there is no evidence for this practice and it is now discouraged.|$|R
5|$|As of 2014, <b>Enema</b> of the State {{remains the}} highest seller in the band's catalogue, moving 4.54 million units {{to date in}} the U.S., {{according}} to Nielsen SoundScan. Combined sales from international markets estimate the album has sold over 15 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Lactulose and {{lactitol}} are disaccharides {{that are}} not absorbed from the digestive tract. They are thought to decrease the generation of ammonia by bacteria, render the ammonia inabsorbable by converting it to ammonium (NH4+) ions, and increase transit of bowel content through the gut. Doses of 15-30ml are administered three times a day; the result is aimed to be 3–5 soft stools a day, or (in some settings) a stool pH of <6.0. Lactulose may also be given by <b>enema,</b> especially if encephalopathy is severe. More commonly, phosphate enemas are used. This may relieve constipation, one {{of the causes of}} encephalopathy, and increase bowel transit.|$|E
5|$|Take Off Your Pants and Jacket is {{the fourth}} studio album by American rock band Blink-182. Produced by Jerry Finn, the album was {{released}} on June 12, 2001, through MCA Records. The band {{had spent much of}} the previous year traveling and supporting their third album <b>Enema</b> of the State (1999), which launched the band's mainstream career. The title is a tongue-in-cheek pun on male masturbation ("take off your pants and jack it"). The cover art has icons for each member of the trio: an airplane ("take off"), a pair of pants, and a jacket. The album's first, limited pressing came in three separate discs reflecting each icon and containing separate bonus tracks and joke songs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Enemas</b> cause {{feelings}} of humiliation which {{are key to}} many of those engaged in klismaphilia, [...] and watching the consequent defecation can amplify that humiliation.|$|R

50|$|<b>Enemas</b> or anal douches can, for {{hygienic}} reasons, {{be taken}} prior to anal masturbation if desired, {{but they can}} also be a form of anal masturbation themselves: see klismaphilia.Commonly inserted objects include butt plugs, anal beads, dildos, vibrators and fingers.|$|R
5|$|The group {{recorded}} with Finn {{over a period}} of three months at numerous locations in their hometown of San Diego and in Los Angeles. Finn was key in producing the fast-paced, melodic mixes, creating pop punk with a more radio-friendly, accessible polish. Lyrically, the album is inspired by adolescent frustration and relationships. Guitarist Tom DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus primarily culled stories from friends and autobiographical situations to craft summery tracks revolving around breakups, suburban parties and maturity, as well as more offbeat subject matter such as UFO conspiracy theories. The cover artwork for <b>Enema</b> of the State features porn star Janine Lindemulder famously clad in a nurse uniform, and the title is a pun on the term enemy of the state.|$|E
5|$|In October 2002, Triple H {{would begin}} a {{controversial}} feud with Kane, {{leading to a}} match at No Mercy on October 20 in which both Kane's Intercontinental Championship and Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship were at stake. In the weeks preceding the match, Triple H claimed that, several years earlier, Kane had an unrequited relationship with a woman named Katie Vick. He went on to claim that, after Vick {{was killed in a}} car crash, Kane (the driver) raped her corpse. Triple H later threatened to show video footage of Kane committing the act in question; however, the footage that finally aired showed Triple H (dressed as Kane) simulating necrophilia with a mannequin in a casket; Kane's tag team partner The Hurricane responded the following week by showing a video of Triple H (rather, someone wearing a Triple H series of masks) getting an <b>enema.</b> The angle was very unpopular with fans, and was de-emphasized before the title match. Triple H went on to defeat Kane at No Mercy, unifying the two titles.|$|E
5|$|Nero's predecessor, Claudius, was {{allegedly}} poisoned with mushrooms or alternatively poison herbs. However, {{accounts of the}} way Claudius died vary greatly. Halotus, his taster, Gaius Stertinius Xenophon, his doctor, and the infamous poisoner Locusta have all been accused of possibly being the administrator of the fatal substance, but Agrippina, his final wife, {{is considered to be}} the most likely to have arranged his murder and may have even administered the poison herself. Some report that he died after prolonged suffering following a single dose at his evening meal, while some say that he recovered somewhat, only to be poisoned once more by a feather dipped in poison which was pushed down his throat under the pretense of helping him to vomit, or by poisoned gruel or an <b>enema.</b> Agrippina is considered to be the murderer, because she was ambitious for her son, Nero, and Claudius had become suspicious of her intrigues.|$|E

50|$|<b>Enemas</b> {{have also}} been used for ritual rectal drug {{administration}} such as balché, alcohol, tobacco, peyote, and other hallucinogenic drugs and entheogens, most notably by the Maya and also some other American Indian tribes. Some tribes continue the practice in the present day.|$|R
50|$|<b>Enemas</b> {{have also}} been {{forcibly}} applied {{as a means of}} punishment. In the vastly influential Latin American text Facundo, or Civilization and Barbarism, for example, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento describes the use of pepper and turpentine enemas by police forces as a way of discouraging political dissent in post-independence Argentina.|$|R
5|$|Blink-182 {{consisted}} of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, and by 2004 had {{been regarded as}} the most successful pop punk act of the time since the releases of <b>Enema</b> of the State (1999) and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001). During its brief hiatus in 2002, DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back and collected several darker musical ideas he viewed unsuitable for the band; the ideas were used in supergroup Box Car Racer's self-titled album, recorded with assistance from Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy. Box Car Racer {{was intended as a}} one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band involving Barker. The side project would cause personal conflicts between DeLonge and Hoppus, the latter was {{not a member of the}} supergroup and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter on Box Car Racer was incorporated into the sound of Blink-182, who explored experimentalist elements on their eponymous fifth studio album (2003). After the success of Box Car Racer, DeLonge declined a solo recording deal offered by Geffen Records because he believed it would cast negative light on Blink-182, but it loomed over the band in addition to growing internal tension.|$|E
5|$|By 2004, Blink-182, {{consisting}} of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, had {{emerged as the}} biggest pop punk act of the era, releasing the seven-times-multiplatinum <b>Enema</b> of the State (1999) and number one album Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001). The band took a brief break in 2002 when DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back, during which time he collected several darker musical ideas he felt unsuitable for Blink-182, compiling them into a record, Box Car Racer. The album, recorded {{with the help of}} Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy, was intended as a one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band with Barker behind the kit. The side project would cause great division between DeLonge and Hoppus, who was not included and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter and music on Box Car Racer edged its way into the Blink sound as well, and the band explored experimentalist elements on their next effort, an eponymous fifth studio album (2003). Geffen Records, after the success of Box Car Racer, offered DeLonge a solo recording deal, which he declined, feeling that it would cast a negative shadow over the band. Nevertheless, the possible deal loomed over the band, contributing to internal tension.|$|E
5|$|With massive {{radio and}} video play, Blink-182 played to larger crowds {{when they began}} touring in support of <b>Enema</b> of the State. The Loserkids Tour {{commenced}} {{in the autumn of}} 1999 and was the band's first arena tour. The band was forced to postpone remaining dates of a spring European tour in 2000 when both DeLonge and Barker came down with strep throat. The band played to sold-out audiences and performed worldwide during the summer of 2000 on The Mark, Tom and Travis Show Tour. The tour was staged as a drive-in movie, with a giant retro billboard suspended from the ceiling, and films were projected on the screen behind the band– including vintage gay porn as a joke. The tour {{was one of the most}} anticipated rock tours of the season and the band headed out on the road with Bad Religion and Fenix TX. Barker broke one of his fingers during an altercation with two men who kept flirting with his girlfriend in Ohio, and Damon Delapaz, guitarist of Fenix TX, stepped in on drums for Barker. Hoppus recalled an overwhelming emotional feeling when the band sold out the Great Western Forum in Los Angeles.|$|E
50|$|Several other {{laxatives}} {{are available}} for cleansing of the bowels prior to colonoscopy, surgery, or other procedures. Studies have shown some of these to be comparable to macrogol solutions in terms of effectiveness and better tolerated by patients due to the lower volume of laxative which must be ingested. <b>Enemas</b> are another option.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Enemas</b> {{may also}} be used to relieve {{constipation}} and fecal impaction, although in the U.S. and some other parts of the world, their use has been replaced in most professional health-care settings by oral laxatives and laxative suppositories. In-home use of enemas for constipation and alternative health purposes is somewhat harder to measure.|$|R
50|$|In chronic {{constipation}} {{of unknown}} cause, the main treatment involves the increased intake {{of water and}} fiber (either dietary or as supplements). The routine use of laxatives is discouraged, as having bowel movements may come to be dependent upon their use. <b>Enemas</b> {{can be used to}} provide a form of mechanical stimulation. However, enemas are generally useful only for stool in the rectum, not in the intestinal tract.|$|R
25|$|The term barium <b>enema</b> usually {{refers to}} a lower {{gastrointestinal}} series, although enteroclysis (an upper gastrointestinal series) is often called a small bowel barium <b>enema.</b>|$|E
25|$|Various {{types of}} barium X-ray {{examinations}} {{are used to}} examine {{different parts of the}} gastrointestinal tract. These include barium swallow, barium meal, barium follow-through, and barium <b>enema.</b> The barium swallow, barium meal, and barium follow-through are together also called an upper gastrointestinal series (or study), whereas the barium <b>enema</b> is called a lower gastrointestinal series (or study). In upper gastrointestinal series examinations, the barium sulfate is mixed with water and swallowed orally, whereas in the lower gastrointestinal series (barium <b>enema),</b> the barium contrast agent is administered as an <b>enema</b> through a small tube inserted into the rectum.|$|E
25|$|Initially a 4 g Mesalazine <b>enema</b> (Rowasa) {{is given}} nightly.|$|E
50|$|Various {{methods of}} {{treatment}} attempt {{to remove the}} impaction by softening the stool, lubricating the stool, or breaking it into pieces small enough for removal. <b>Enemas</b> and osmotic laxatives {{can be used to}} soften the stool by increasing the water content until it is soft enough to be expelled. Osmotic laxatives such as magnesium citrate work within minutes - 8 hours for onset of action, and even then they may not be sufficient to expel the stool.|$|R
40|$|Early full {{enteral feeding}} in preterm infants {{decreases}} morbidity and mortality. Our systematic review covered {{the effectiveness of}} rectal stimulation, suppositories and enemas on stooling patterns and feeding tolerance in low-birthweight infants born at up to 32 weeks. It comprised seven studies published between 2007 and 2014 and covered 495 infants. CONCLUSION: Suppositories were ineffective in shortening the time to reach full enteral feeding, and the evidence on enemas was contradictory. <b>Enemas</b> and rectal stimulation did not shorten the time until complete meconium evacuation was reached. Further research into safe, effective interventions to accelerate meconium excretion is needed...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} beliefs and {{practices}} relating to childhood diarrhea, relying primarily on traditional healers as informants and survey respondents, revealed an indegenous classification of childhood diarrhea into three main types. <b>Enemas</b> are used as a treatment in two types of more serious diarrhea regarded as due to unnatural causes. Most children with diarrhea are taken to clinics only after home treatments and those of traditional healers have failed, by which time a child may be severely dehydrated. The role of oral rehydration and strategies for health education {{are discussed in the}} context of Swazi culture. ...|$|R

50|$|Osmotic {{laxatives}} {{can cause}} cramping and even severe pain as the patient's attempts {{to evacuate the}} contents of the rectum are blocked by the fecal mass. Polyethylene glycol (PEG 3500) may be used to increase the water content of the stool without cramping; however, since it may take 24 to 48 hours for it to take effect, it is not well suited to cases where the impaction needs to be removed immediately due to risk of complications or severe pain. <b>Enemas</b> (such as hyperosmotic saline) and suppositories (such as glycerine suppositories) work by increasing water content and stimulating peristalsis to aid in expulsion, and both work much more quickly than oral laxatives.|$|R
40|$|Constipation is {{a common}} {{complaint}} amongst older people although they are often concerned about features of constipa-tion other than bowel action frequency. A careful assessment should be made, including a history, examination and appro-priate investigations. Non-pharmacological management often avoids the use of laxatives and includes adequate fibre, fluid and exercise. The laxatives most appropriate for older people include stimulants such as senna, bulking agents and osmotic agents such as polyethylene glycol plus electrolytes or sorbitol. Short-term use is nearly always sufficient. Faecal impaction should be sought and managed before giving oral agents. <b>Enemas</b> and suppositories are usually appropriate for impaction and for excessive straining. Management of constipation with these measures will avoid long-term use and abuse of laxatives. J Pharm Pract Res 2002; 32 : 37 - 43...|$|R
40|$|<b>Enemas</b> of 4 -amino-salicylic acid (4 -ASA) {{have been}} {{compared}} with placebo enemas in a double-blind {{study for the}} treatment of distal ulcerative colitis of mild to moderate severity. 30 patients were randomised to receive enemas containing 1 g of 4 -ASA or placebo, and 22 to receive 2 -gram enemas of 4 -ASA or placebo. For each dose of 4 -ASA there was clinical and sigmoidoscopic improvement, which reached significance when all patients receiving 4 -ASA enemas were compared with those receiving placebo enemas (Cochran's test: p less than 0. 005). There was also a trend towards histological improvement, but this failed to reach the level of significance. These findings suggest that 4 -ASA may provide a stable, inexpensive alternative to 5 -ASA for the topical treatment of ulcerative colitis or for linking to carrier molecules for release in the colon...|$|R
