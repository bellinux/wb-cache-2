This was achieved by Fliegerkorps VIII, which supported the German Eighteenth Army in forcing the Soviet 54th Army from the shores of Lake Ladoga and Leningrad was isolated. Thereafter, Fliegerkorps VIII and <b>I</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> a 16 square kilometres of front over Leningrad, achieving numerical superiority. Richthofen's bombers participated in great efforts to destroy Leningrad from the air, some crews flying two missions per night. On 8 September, 6,327 incendiaries alone were dropped causing 183 fires. The German Army advanced into the breaches created by the Luftwaffe. However, by committing their last resources and reinforcing their 54th Army (later renamed the 48th Army), the Soviets stalled the German advance on 25 September. With the offensive stopped, Hitler returned Richthofen to Luftflotte 2. Operations had been expensive. In August Fliegerkorps VIII had lost 27 aircraft destroyed and 143 damaged.|$|E

[...] Influenced by Hodgkins, Smith focused on painting and started exhibiting her work in small galleries. [...] "It was during the depression and no-one was interested in art or artists. I was mainly concerned with earning a living so <b>I</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> textiles." [...] She taught herself fabric designing and printing, using wood or linoleum cut blocks. She had some success selling her hand-printed fabric to boutique stores such as Peter Jones and Heal and Sons but did no repeat business.|$|E

5000|$|His form {{prompted}} Swansea City boss Jan Mølby {{to bring}} him back into league football along with teammate Dave O'Gorman for a combined fee of £60,000. Bird was a regular in his first season at the club, finishing as the club's top scorer for the 1997-98 season with 18 goals, before eventually following Molby to his next club, Kidderminster Harriers, following his release from Swansea in 2000. Molby's assistant at Kidderminster was Bird's former Barry Town manager Gary Barnett. He made his debut for the Harriers on 12 August 2000 against Torquay United, but suffered a goal drought at the club for several months, leading manager Molby to publicly offer his backing to Bird, commenting:"It's a nightmare from a striker's point of view. He's trying his hardest, maybe a little bit too hard, but I'm sure it will all come good in the end." [...] He eventually scored his first goals on his 17th appearance of the season, netting a late brace during a 2-1 victory over Kingstonian in a Championship Shield match on 8 November 2000. He was transfer listed in January 2001, but managed to force his way back into the side by switching to a right-midfield position during an injury crisis at the club. He credited being placed on the transfer list as his motivation to prove himself at the club, stating: [...] ""What happened with the transfer-listing gave me a good kick up the backside.

The director says it is the artist's special place in Indian art that had drawn him to his life. [...] "A few years ago, I had done a play on Ravi Varma for KPAC. During my reading and research on him, I was fascinated {{to know more about the}} man and the circumstances in which those works were created. Here was a prince who had paid a price for pursuing his passion for the arts. He faced hostility and criticism but that did not put an end to his affair with brush and paint. Cases were filed against him but he fought against the orthodoxy and won the right to express himself. I felt there was space for a movie," [...] he explains. Instead of a biopic on the artist, the director wanted to focus on the artist at work, and chose a single work to unfold the life of the artist and the period he worked and lived in. [...] "Although his style was European, his themes were from Indian mythology. In each of his works on the Indian Puranas, he chose a point in the story that was filled with drama and emotion. I was stuck by the sensitivity and acumen of the man who used his brush to depict those moments. That is why I felt I could understand him better if <b>I</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> a work and then narrate the story of the artist's creative process," [...] says the director.|$|E

In the tournament's second week he maintained his unbeaten run with wins over his fellow ōzeki Terunofuji and Kisenosato and the yokozuna Kakuryū to open up a two-win lead over his rivals. On day thirteen he defeated Harumafuji with a neck throw (kubinage) meaning that he needed only one win in the last two days to secure his first tournament victory. On September 24, the penultimate day of the tournament Gōeidō clinched the title with a force-out (yorikiri) win over Tamawashi. After his win he commented, [...] "I just focused on wrestling as hard as I could. I’m really happy. There was a time when things didn’t go my way, but I’m glad I stuck it out. <b>I</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>on</b> my performance and took it one bout at a time, which led to this result".
