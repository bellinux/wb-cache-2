But {{whenever}} the court {{let me go}} I was arrested again. I have learnt to speak English better. Perhaps I do not speak King's English but it's Kisch English anyhow. I did not come <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> there is terrorism in Europe. I come <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you how to stop it. I have been an eye-witness. I was arrested the day the Reichstag was burnt down by Göring and his lieutenants. I saw my friend, Erich Mühsam, the poet, whose works I translated, made to walk naked, even in winter, and to lick up the spittle of his captors. All his limbs were broken gradually, and he died." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{theme of}} the book, at least as {{perceived}} from its title, aroused immediate opposition within the United States. [...] A well known instance of this occurred during the 1996 presidential election when, during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Republican Party nominee Bob Dole said: [...] "... with all due respect, I am <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, {{it does not take}} a village to raise a child. It takes a family to raise a child." [...] Criticism of Clinton's notion would continue to be made by American conservatives such as Rush Limbaugh, Andrea Tantaros, and Jonah Goldberg through the next two decades.|$|E

Marie Huhtala, the American ambassador to Malaysia, responded with a statement: [...] "These are not helpful statements by any standard, and I'm <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that Washington does take note of them. They are bound to have a harmful effect on the relationship." ...|$|E
2500|$|Political infighting with career Ford executives, notably Lee Iacocca, {{led to his}} {{dismissal}} from Ford on September 11, 1969. Reportedly, Henry Ford II sent Ford's {{vice president}} for public relations, Ted Mecke, to Knudsen's home the previous night to inform {{him that he would}} be fired, telling Knudsen that [...] "Henry sent me <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that tomorrow will be a rough day at work." [...] When Ford made the decision official the next day, Bunkie said [...] "I'm shocked" [...] to which Ford replied, [...] "I imagine you would be." [...] Noted for his laconic replies to difficult questions, Mr. Ford told the media [...] "Things just didn't work out", but later reports indicated many career Ford executives allied themselves with Iacocca and were working against Knudsen. His dismissal led to a widely circulated witticism in Ford circles as the hallmark phrase of Henry Ford I, [...] "History is bunk", was turned around to [...] "Bunkie is history".|$|E

2500|$|Principal {{photography}} in Vancouver wrapped, as planned, on 15 April, but the production was soon beset by further tragedy when producer William Vince died of cancer, {{just two days}} after model shooting back in London had wrapped. Fellow producer Amy Gilliam, Terry's daughter, remembered, [...] " [...] always said, 'If you get your film in the can, you'll be all right.' And I kind of believe that he stayed with us to know that happened." [...] Eventually, while on post-production, Gilliam himself was hit by a car, resulting in a cracked vertebra. Gilliam recalled: [...] "So I thought, it was third time lucky – they just didn't get me. They got the star, the producer, and they were going for the director, and the fuckers failed on the last one. Whoever they are..." [...] "They were going for the trinity [...] That would have been a tidy end to the whole thing. But they didn't kill me. I'm stuck <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the tale." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jean {{embraced her}} role as acting commander-in-chief, {{one of her first}} {{international}} duties being a trip, from October 29–30, 2005, to France for the 90th anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge, just after which she returned to Canada for the arrival at Trenton, Ontario, of the bodies of six Canadian soldiers killed in Afghanistan. Jean made on March 8, 2007, her first visit to Canadian troops taking part in the offensive in Afghanistan; she had earlier expressed her desire to go, but Harper advised against such a trip on the grounds of security concerns, the relevance of which were demonstrated when two attacks were made against Canadian soldiers on the same day the Governor General landed in Kabul. Jean had the arrival timed specifically for International Women's Day, stating: [...] "the women of Afghanistan may face the most unbearable conditions, but they never stop fighting for survival. Of course, we, the rest of the women around the world, took too long to hear the cries of our Afghan sisters, but I am <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them that they are no longer alone. And neither are the people of Afghanistan." [...] Part of the Governor General's itinerary included meeting with Afghan women, Canadian soldiers, Royal Canadian Mounted Police teams, humanitarian workers, and diplomats.|$|E
2500|$|The initial aim was {{to respond}} to Roths legacy by {{continuing}} activities {{he was involved in}} or planned during his last years, not least a Roth Show/Road Show featuring art and activities by him and his friends at various venues. As well as initiating new projects that tally with Dieters plans and thoughts, and providing a forum for his ideas. It meets several times a year in different countries for conferences and discussions, often accompanied by an exhibition of works by the members, friends and students. This has resulted in a number of publications, and an intensification of communications between the members that produces additional projects in line with the DRA ethos. Almost every meeting ends up with stories about Dieter Roth, amusing anecdotes that are also touchstones for future actions. Quite possibly the stories {{are one of the most}} important legacies we have. The forum is <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> stories, to examine the ideas we have received from Dieters words and practice, and marvel at the changes the Academy undergoes as it acts on its legacy, very much like a Dieter Roth artwork. In short, the Academy is here to promote and develop the artistic and above all human insights he gave us all. Previous meetings have been in: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{comment was}} brought up again in an {{interview}} with Amy Goodman for Democracy Now! in 2006. In January 2006, Belafonte led a delegation of activists including actor Danny Glover and activist/professor Cornel West to meet with President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez. In 2005, Chávez, an outspoken Bush critic, initiated a program to provide cheaper heating oil for poor people in several areas of the United States. Belafonte supported this initiative. He was quoted as saying, during the meeting with Chávez, [...] "No matter what the greatest tyrant in the world, the greatest terrorist in the world, George W. Bush says, we're <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you: Not hundreds, not thousands, but millions of the American people support your revolution." [...] Belafonte and Glover met again with Chávez in 2006. The comment ignited a great deal of controversy. Hillary Clinton refused to acknowledge Belafonte's presence at an awards ceremony that featured both of them. AARP, which had just named him one of its 10 Impact Award honorees 2006, released this statement following the remarks: [...] "AARP does not condone the manner and tone which he has chosen and finds his comments completely unacceptable." [...] During a Martin Luther King Jr. Day speech at Duke University in 2006, Belafonte compared the American government to the hijackers of the September 11 attacks, saying: [...] "What is the difference between that terrorist and other terrorists?" [...] In response to criticism about his remarks Belafonte asked, [...] "What do you call Bush when the war he put us in to date has killed almost as many Americans as died on 9/11 and the number of Americans wounded in war is almost triple? [...] By most definitions Bush can be considered a terrorist." [...] When he was asked about his expectation of criticism for his remarks on the war in Iraq, Belafonte responded: [...] "Bring it on. Dissent is central to any democracy." ...|$|E
