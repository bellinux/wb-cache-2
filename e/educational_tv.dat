5|$|Sesame Street {{has also}} been the {{subjects}} of many controversies throughout its long run on television. In 1970, a commission in Mississippi voted to exclude the show from its state <b>educational</b> <b>TV</b> programming. The controversy surrounding the show stemmed from cultural and historical reasons regarding children and television's effect on them. Latino and feminists groups criticized Sesame Street for its depictions of some groups, but its producers have worked to address their concerns throughout the years.

The GCC considered creating a co-production for many years, so consultations were held among its member countries regarding how to do so. Many of the early co-productions were simple, dubbed versions with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways, but the GCC wanted to create their own original version.|$|E
