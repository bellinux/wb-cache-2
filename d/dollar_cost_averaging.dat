40|$|OBJECTIVE: Sexually {{transmitted}} infection (STI) {{services were}} {{offered by the}} nongovernmental organization Médecins Sans Frontières-Holland in Banteay Meanchey province, Cambodia, between 1997 and 1999. These services targeted female sex workers but were available to the general population. We conducted {{an evaluation of the}} operational performance and costs of this real-life project. METHODS: Effectiveness outcomes (syndromic cure rates of STIs) were obtained by retrospectively analysing patients' records. Annual financial and economic costs were estimated from the provider's perspective. Unit costs for the cost-effectiveness analysis included the cost per visit, per partner treated, and per syndrome treated and cured. FINDINGS: Over 30 months, 11, 330 patients attended the clinics; of these, 7776 (69 %) were STI index patients and only 1012 (13 %) were female sex workers. A total of 15 269 disease episodes and 30 488 visits were recorded. Syndromic cure rates ranged from 39 % among female sex workers with genital ulcers to 74 % among men with genital discharge; there were variations over time. Combined rates of syndromes classified as cured or improved were around 84 - 95 % for all syndromes. The total economic costs of the project were US 766, 046 <b>dollars.</b> The <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> per visit over 30 months was US 25. 12 <b>dollars</b> and the <b>cost</b> per partner treated for an STI was US 50. 79 <b>dollars.</b> The <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> per STI syndrome treated was US 48. 43 dollars, of which US 4. 92 dollars was for drug treatment. The costs per syndrome cured or improved ranged from US 46. 95 - 153. 00 dollars for men with genital ulcers to US 57. 85 - 251. 98 dollars for female sex workers with genital discharge. CONCLUSION: This programme was only partly successful in reaching its intended target population of sex workers and their male partners. Decreasing cure rates among sex workers led to relatively poor cost-effectiveness outcomes overall despite decreasing unit costs...|$|R

50|$|Value {{averaging}}, {{also known}} as dollar value averaging (DVA), is a technique of adding to an investment portfolio {{with the objective of}} providing a greater return than similar methods such as <b>dollar</b> <b>cost</b> <b>averaging</b> and random investment. It was developed by former Harvard University professor Michael E. Edleson. Value averaging is a formula-based investment technique where a mathematical formula is used to guide the investment of money into a portfolio over time. With the method, investors contribute to their portfolios {{in such a way that}} the portfolio balance increases by a set amount, regardless of market fluctuations. As a result, in periods of market declines, the investor contributes more, while in periods of market climbs, the investor contributes less. In contrast to <b>dollar</b> <b>cost</b> <b>averaging</b> which mandates that a fixed amount of money be invested at each period, the value averaging investor may actually be required to withdraw from the portfolio in some periods.|$|E

50|$|Michael E. Edleson and Paul S. Marshall {{argue that}} Value Averaging can provide for an {{increased}} {{rate of return}} when compared to <b>dollar</b> <b>cost</b> <b>averaging</b> and other investment techniques. Professor Edleson recommends a VA period of three years. He suggests an infusion or withdrawal of capital every three or six months. For example, {{if one were to}} win or be bequeathed one million dollars, roughly 8.33 percent, with the exact amount being set by the formula, could be invested every quarter. It {{is important to note that}} the quarterly or semiannual amount can vary greatly, even resulting in a withdrawal, as mentioned above. Opponents argue that this misses the opportunity of already being fully invested when a large market upswing occurs. This argument against value averaging and <b>dollar</b> <b>cost</b> <b>averaging</b> and in favor of lump sum investing ignores the suggestion of Ben Stein and Phil DeMuth that it is more important to avoid a large market downswing, which is theoretically equally possible, since market movements are essentially unpredictable. Participating early on in a large market downswing has been shown to be devastating to the success of long term retirement, for example.|$|E

After the investment has over-performed, the investor {{will be required to}} buy less or sell. After the investment has under-performed, the investor will be required to buy more. Some research suggests that the method results in higher returns at a similar risk, especially for high market variability and long time horizons. Some research suggests otherwise.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dollar</b> <b>cost</b> <b>averaging</b> {{is a form}} {{of product}} churn under certain conditions. In this strategy, an {{investor}} is advised to repeatedly buy or sell small lots of a security as the price changes. Each transaction carries a commission fee. In this way the overall cost is averaged down as prices fall, and the investor is protected from market fluctuations which can be very difficult to accurately predict. The effectiveness of this as an investing strategy is open to debate, but it involves many transactions, creating brokerage commissions for the brokerage firm. Frequent trading in fee-based accounts is not an example of churning, since no commissions are generated in those transactions. However, the practice of putting clients who trade infrequently into a fee-based brokerage account is known as [...] "reverse churning", since clients are charged fees in accounts with few if any transactions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dollar</b> <b>cost</b> <b>averaging</b> is not {{the same}} thing as continuous, {{automatic}} investing. This confusion of terms is perpetuated by some articles (AARP, Motley Fool) and specifically noted by others (Vanguard). The argued weakness of DCA arises in the context of having the option to invest a lump sum, but choosing to use DCA instead. If the market is expected to trend upwards over time, DCA can conversely be expected to face a statistical headwind: the investor is choosing to invest at a future time rather than today, even though future prices are expected to be higher. But most individual investors, especially in the context of retirement investing, never face a choice between lump sum investing and DCA investing with a significant amount of money. The disservice arises when these investors take the criticisms of DCA to mean that timing the market is better than continuously and automatically investing a portion of their income as they earn it. For example, stopping one's retirement investment contributions during a declining market on account of the argued weaknesses of DCA would indicate a misunderstanding of those arguments.|$|E
40|$|AIMS: Neonatal {{intensive}} care is expensive, {{and thus it}} is essential that its long-term outcomes are measured. The costs of follow-up studies for high-risk children who survive are unknown. This study aims to determine current costs for the assessment of health and development of children followed up in our research programme. METHODS: Costs were determined for children involved in the research follow-up programme at the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne, over the 6 -month period between 1 st January 2012 and 30 th June 2012. The time required for health professionals involved in assessments in early and later childhood was estimated, and converted into <b>dollar</b> <b>costs.</b> Costs for equipment and data management were added. Estimated costs were compared with actual costs of running the research follow-up programme. RESULTS: A total of 134 children were assessed over the 6 -month period. The estimated <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> per child assessed was $ 1184, much higher than was expected. The estimated cost to assess a toddler was $ 1149, whereas for an 11 -year-old it was $ 1443, the difference attributable to the longer psychological and paediatric assessments. The actual <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> per child assessed was $ 1623. The shortfall of $ 439 between the actual and estimated <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> per child arose chiefly because of the need to pay staff even when participants were late or failed to attend. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> of assessing children at each age for research studies are much higher than expected.

5000|$|By {{dividing}} the total sum to {{be invested in}} the market (e.g. $100,000) into equal amounts put into the market at regular intervals (e.g. $1000 over 100 weeks), DCA hopes {{to reduce the risk}} of incurring a substantial loss resulting from investing the entire [...] "lump sum" [...] just before a fall in the market. <b>Dollar</b> <b>cost</b> <b>averaging</b> is not always the most profitable way to invest a large sum, but it is alleged to minimize downside risk. The technique is said to work in markets undergoing temporary declines because it exposes only part of the total sum to the decline. The technique is so-called because of its potential for reducing the average cost of shares bought. As the amount of shares that can be bought for a fixed amount of money varies inversely with their price, DCA effectively leads to more shares being purchased when their price is low and fewer when they are expensive. As a result, DCA possibly can lower the total average cost per share of the investment, giving the investor a lower overall cost for the shares purchased over time.|$|E
