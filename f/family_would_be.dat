If it were invested in a pawn broking business, in three years the interest would equal the capital. He would still have the 100,000 strings, and the rest, being interest, could be divided.

Knowing that the entire <b>family</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> put in jeopardy if his father stayed behind, Petrović either took his father's life or arranged for someone to kill him instead.|$|E
5|$|Leopold viewed {{a strong}} {{military}} {{as the key}} to maintaining Belgian independence against France and, after the Franco-Prussian War, an expansionist Germany. After cutting the defense budget in the 1860s, the government was advised by a military commission to increase the size of the army and to abolish the system of Remplacement, whereby rich Belgians selected for military service by lot could pay for a substitute to take their place. Leopold II personally lobbied successive governments to implement the findings of the report and institute a fundamental reform of the army. Reform was opposed by both the Liberal and Catholic Parties, which viewed the army with suspicion and Remplacement as a key civil right. In a move supported only by the socialists, Remplacement was abolished in 1909. This was the last legal document signed before Leopold's death. Under the new system, one son per <b>family</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> liable for military service regardless of social class but the total size of the military remained the same.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{negotiations}} in the U.S. embassy, Chen did not request asylum in the United States or considered leaving China, but instead demanded to remain {{there as a}} free man. However, soon after leaving the embassy, Chen feared that Chinese authorities would renege on their promises or take punitive actions against his family members. While in the hospital, Chinese security personnel barred U.S. diplomatic staff from meeting with him. Rumors emerged that Chinese officials had coerced Chen into leaving the embassy by threatening his family. U.S. negotiators stated that while in the embassy, Chen {{had been told by}} Chinese officials that if he sought asylum in the United States, his wife and daughter would likely remain under house arrest in Shandong. However, they maintained that they had not heard of the threats from local officials that his <b>family</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> beaten, and that they had not communicated such a message to Chen. On 3 May, Chen clarified to the BBC that he had become aware of the threats against his family after leaving the embassy, and at that point changed his mind about wishing to stay in China.|$|E

5|$|Regardless {{of whether}} Pope Pius IX had been {{personally}} {{involved in the}} decision to remove Mortara from his parents—whether he had been or not was debated extensively in the press—what is certain is that he was greatly surprised by the international furore that erupted over the matter, and promptly adopted the position that to return the baptised child to his non-Christian <b>family</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> totally incompatible with Church doctrine. As foreign governments and the various branches of the Rothschild family one by one condemned his actions, Pius IX stood firm on what he saw as a matter of principle. Those angered included Emperor Napoleon III of France, who found the situation particularly vexing as the pontifical government owed its very existence to the French garrison in Rome. Napoleon III had indifferently supported the Pope's temporal rule because it enjoyed widespread support among French Catholics; the scandal over Mortara weakened this considerably and, according to the historian Roger Aubert, provided the final straw that changed French policy. In February 1859 Napoleon III concluded a secret pact with the Kingdom of Sardinia pledging French military support for a campaign to drive the Austrians out and unify Italy—most of the pontifical domain would be absorbed along with the Two Sicilies and other minor states.|$|E

He then convinced Diệm and Nhu to send several companies of ARVN Special Forces personnel out of the capital to fight the communists. The United States had cut off funding for the CIA-trained Special Forces because Diệm used them to stop coups, repress dissidents and attack Buddhist pagodas in the capital instead of combating the communists in rural areas. Mậu's deception meant that what was effectively a private unit of the Ngô <b>family</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> unable to defend them.|$|E
25|$|The {{leaders of}} the Easter Rising had proclaimed a republic. Arthur Griffith's Sinn Féin organisation, which had favoured the {{establishment}} of a form of dual monarchy between Ireland and Britain, had not taken part in the Rising. In 1917, Griffith's Sinn Féin and republicans under Éamon de Valera, came together to form the new Sinn Féin Party. A compromise was reached at the 1917 Ard Fheis (party conference), where it was agreed that the party would pursue {{the establishment of a}}n independent republic in the short term, until the Irish people could {{be given the opportunity to}} decide on the form of government they preferred.

25|$|One {{condition}} of the Hearst Corporation's donation of the estate was that the Hearst <b>family</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> allowed to use it when they wished. Patty Hearst, a granddaughter of William Randolph, related that as a child, she hid behind statues in the Neptune Pool while tours passed by. Although the main estate is now a museum, the Hearst family continues to use an older Victorian house on the property as a retreat – the original house built by George Hearst in the late 19th century. The house is screened from tourist routes by a dense grove of eucalyptus to provide maximum privacy for the guests. In 2001, Patty Hearst hosted a Travel Channel show on the estate, and Amanda Hearst modeled for a fashion photo shoot at the estate for a Hearst Corporation magazine, Town and Country, in 2006.|$|E

25|$|In {{the winter}} of 2007, the Department of Transportation {{announced}} {{the construction of the}} new interchange between Route15 and Route184, as part of the construction to upgrade Route15 into an interstate highway. The total cost for the portion from Trout Run to Buttonwood was to be $71 million (2007USD). Early plans were to build an interchange south of Route184, which would mean that southbound travelers would have to backtrack to access local businesses. Per a suggestion by the Fry family, owners of a local restaurant, the design was changed to realign Route184 to the north and build a full interchange. As a result, a few homes belonging to members of the Fry <b>family</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{in the way of the}} new roadways, and the buildings were moved to nearby family-owned land. The project was completed in the fall of 2009 with a ribbon cutting ceremony on the southbound lanes.|$|E
25|$|Isabella of Lennox (d.1458) was {{the ruler}} of Lennox, from 1437–1458, and last {{in the line of}} Mormaers or Native Scottish rulers.

She would eventually live to see the violent death of her former persecutor, King James.
