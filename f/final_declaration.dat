Subsequent discussions led to Balfour's request, on 19 June, that Rothschild and Chaim Weizmann submit a draft of a public declaration. Further drafts were discussed by the British Cabinet during September and October, with input from Zionist and anti-Zionist Jews but with no representation from the local population in Palestine.

The present article would be useful for researchers as it sums up all the information available at this moment in Romania about the programs that are being implemented.

First, the absence of Heads of State and Government from the Southern Mediterranean countries (with the exception of the Palestinian and Turkish ones) heavily contrasted with the attendance of the 27 European Union's Heads of State and Government. Second, the lack of consensus to define the term [...] "terrorism" [...] prevented the endorsement of a <b>final</b> <b>declaration.</b> The Palestinian Authority, Syria and Algeria argued that resistance movements against foreign occupation should not be included in this definition.
