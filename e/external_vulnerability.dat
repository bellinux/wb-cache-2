50|$|Ratios {{relating}} {{reserves to}} other external sector variables are popular among credit risk agencies {{and international organizations}} to assess the <b>external</b> <b>vulnerability</b> of a country. For example, Article IV of 2013 uses total external debt to gross international reserves, gross international reserves in months of prospective goods and nonfactor services imports to broad money, broad money to short-term external debt, and short-term external debt to short-term external debt on residual maturity basis plus current account deficit. Therefore, countries with similar characteristics accumulate reserves to avoid negative assessment by the financial market, especially when compared to members of a peer group.|$|E

As a result, technologies offered by industry tend to focus less on insider threats than on <b>external</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> [17, 37]. To overcome this deficiency, insider threat detection methods have been proposed to supplement access control frameworks.

The main findings point to three policy lessons for improving growth sustainability. First, greater reliance on tradable sectors should be {{the cornerstone of the}} future growth model. Second, enhancing domestic sources of bank credit funding would contribute to mitigation of <b>external</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> and make domestic financial system more resilient to global financial shocks. Third, prudential and macroeconomic policies will have to be more proactive in managing capital inflows, including funneling these inflows into investment in the export-oriented industries.

40|$|In recent years, Brazilian {{economic}} performance has {{been influenced by}} increasingly volatile financial flows and episodes of capital flight, which have occurred mainly due to external events, out of control or influence of the domestic monetary authorities. This paper aims to measure the volatility of financial flows in Brazil and to apply different measures of capital flight, in order to analyze the <b>external</b> <b>vulnerability</b> of the Brazilian economy. The main goal is to compare the volatility indicators and measures of capital flight in order to evaluate which indicator best reveals the potential for reversion of financial flows to Brazil and best captures <b>external</b> <b>vulnerability</b> in the economy. Our empirical results {{suggest that there is}} a close relationship between the two indicators examined. While volatility of financial flows may capture moments when Brazil is facing a period of inflows of international resources and the transition to sharp reversals and large negative transfers, capital flight may indicate the sensitivity of capital flows toward Brazil due to unstable factors and external shocks. In this sense, the capital flight as the one which occurred in 2008 may be explained by high volatility of capital flows.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the drivers {{and consequences of}} sudden stops of capital flows. It focuses {{on the impact of}} <b>external</b> <b>vulnerability</b> on the depth and length of sudden stop crises. The authors analyze 43 developing and developed countries between 1993 and 2006. They find evidence that <b>external</b> <b>vulnerability</b> not only significantly impacts the probability of a sudden stop crisis, but also prolongs the time it takes for growth to revert to its long-term trend once a sudden stop occurs. Interestingly, <b>external</b> <b>vulnerability</b> does not significantly impact the size of the instantaneous output effect in case of a sudden stop but prompts a cumulative output effect through significantly diminishing the speed of adjustment of output to its trend. This finding implies that countries financing a large part of their absorption externally do not suffer more ferocious output losses in a sudden stop crisis, but take longer to adapt afterward and are hence expected to suffer more protracted crises periods. Compared with previous literature, this paper makes three contributions: (i) it extends the country and time coverage relative to datasets that have previously been used to analyze related topics; (ii) it specifically accounts for time-series autocorrelation; and (iii) it provides an analysis of the adjustment path of economic growth after a sudden stop.

40|$|This paper reviews {{financial}} stability {{challenges in the}} EU candidate countries Croatia, Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It examines the fi nancial sectors in these three economies, which, while at very different stages of development and embedded in quite diverse economic settings, are all {{in a process of}} rapid financial deepening. This manifests itself most clearly in the rapid pace of growth in credit to the private sector. This process of financial deepening is largely a natural and welcome catching-up phenomenon, but it has also increased the credit risks borne by the banking sectors in the three economies. These credit risks are compounded by the widespread use of foreign currency-denominated or -indexed loans, leaving unhedged bank customers exposed to potential swings in exchange rates or foreign interest rates. Moreover, these financial risks form part of a broader nexus of vulnerabilities in the economies concerned, in particular the <b>external</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> arising from increasing private sector external indebtedness. That said, the paper also fi nds that the authorities in the three countries have taken several policy actions to reduce these fi nancial and <b>external</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> and to strengthen the resilience of the financial sectors.

40|$|Differences in income-elasticities {{of imports}} and exports among {{countries}} bring about distinct degrees of external constraints to growth. This argument has been pointed out by Prebisch and by authors in the Kaldorian tradition. Prebisch’s explanations for this phenomenon relate to the differences in international insertion between agrarian / peripheral and industrial / central economies. Kaldorian authors, in turn, refer to Prebisch only to explain why such elasticities differ between products and between countries. However, even after undergoing industrialization processes, several economies still face external constraints to growth. The aim {{of this paper is}} to explain differences in trade elasticities among industrial economies. Therefore, it intends to demonstrate, by using the Neo-Schumpeterian literature, the causal relations between the development of a National Innovation System, the differences in income-elasticities of {{imports and exports}}, the degree of competitiveness and the degree of <b>external</b> <b>vulnerability</b> of an economy. national innovation system, competitiveness, <b>external</b> <b>vulnerability...</b>|$|E

This view runs against extensive empirical evidence showing that globalization, namely rising trade and financial integration, raises business cycle synchronisation. We find that decoupling is a myth: business cycle synchronicity between emerging markets and advanced economies has generally not declined in recent years. ...|$|R

To get further insight, the paper {{discusses the}} future capital inflows from the perspective of nonresidents' supply of external savings and residents' demand for external borrowing and from the perspective of <b>external</b> <b>vulnerability</b> related to large foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow. It concludes that FDI is likely to decline somewhat in the future, but increasing sovereign borrowing needs could lead to higher inflow of portfolio capital.

Lack of country-trust is the fundamental problem behind sudden stops. Lack of currency-trust in turn weakens a country's ability to deal with sudden stops and real external shocks. We discuss steps aimed to improve these two dimensions of investors' confidence in the medium run, and policies to reduce the impact of country-trust and currency-trust weaknesses in the short run.

40|$|Latin American {{economies are}} exposed to {{substantial}} <b>external</b> <b>vulnerability.</b> Domestic imbalances and terms of trade shocks are often exacerbated by sudden financial distress. This paper explores ways of overcoming <b>external</b> <b>vulnerability,</b> drawing lessons from a detailed comparison of the response of Chile and Australia to recent external shocks and from Australia`s historical experience. It is argued that, {{in order to understand}} sudden stops and the mechanisms to smooth them, it is useful to highlight and then draw a distinction between two dimensions of investor confidence: country-trust and currency-trust. While these two dimensions are interrelated, there are important distinctions. Lack of country-trust is a more fundamental and serious problem behind sudden stops. But lack of currency-trust may be a source of country-trust problems as well as weaken a country`s ability to deal with sudden stops. The paper further discusses steps to improve investor confidence in the medium run along these two dimensions, as well as policies to reduce the impact of country-trust and currency-trust weaknesses in the short run. ...|$|E

40|$|In this essay, the Africanist {{critique}} of mainstream International Relations (IR) {{theory and the}} neo-neo synthesis, {{and in particular the}} realist tradition, is critically analysed. It is argued that although the Africanist critique does highlight some pertinent issues, it ultimately fails to be convincing due to, firstly, its misunderstanding of the neo-neo synthesis and the realist tradition in particular; secondly, its disregard for human nature; and thirdly, its promotion of a stance that would lead to further marginalization. It is posited that although Africanists perceive globalisation as Westernisation – and Americanisation to be more specific – and interpret the aforementioned as essentially echoing the Foucauldian notion of a power-knowledge nexus, their interpretation does not necessarily undermine the realist tradition, but rather substantiates it.
