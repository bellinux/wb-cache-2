They excel at reduced size, electromagnetic immunity and corrosion resistance. Furthermore, they {{are sensitive to}} strain and temperature, allowing the record of both parameters simultaneously. For the case of composite materials, FBG sensors can be bonded to part surface or embedded within the CFRP plies prior to curing. During the last one, embedded sensors are exposed to <b>high</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>vacuum</b> and temperature. These conditions modify fiber optic section, causing the degradation of the reflected signal. The received spectrum widens and shows multiple peaks for the same sensor, making signal treatment a complex task. In this paper, an algorithm for peak recognition and monitoring is presented and validated.

However, economical dewatering of the clean coal product to less than 20 percent moisture using conventional technology is difficult. This research program objective is to evaluate a novel coal surface modification technique developed at the University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research in conjunction with conventional and advanced dewatering technique at a pilot scale. The study which is in progress is being conducted at the Powell Mountain Coal Company`s Mayflower preparation plant located in St. Charles, VA. During this quarter laboratory dewatering studies were conducted using a 4 -in diameter laboratory chemical centrifuge. The baseline data provided a filter cake with about 32 % moisture.

They are also largely unaffected by <b>high</b> temperature, <b>pressure,</b> <b>vacuum</b> or vibration. As these sensors do not require physical contact with the process material, so the transmitter /receiver can be mounted a safe distance above/from the process, even with an antenna extension of several metres to reduce temperature, yet still respond to the changes in level or distance changes e.g. they are ideal for measurement of molten metal products at over 1200 Â°C. Microwave transmitters also offer the same key advantage of ultrasonics: the presence of a microprocessor to process the signal, provide numerous monitoring, controls, communications, setup and diagnostic capabilities and are independent of changing density, viscosity and electrical properties. Additionally, they solve some of the application limitations of ultrasonics: operation in <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> and <b>vacuum,</b> <b>high</b> temperatures, dust, temperature and vapor layers. Guided Wave Radars can measure in narrow confined spaces very successfully, as the guide element ensures correct transmission to and from the measured liquid. Applications such as inside stilling tubes or external bridles or cages, offer an excellent alternative to float or displacement devices, as they remove any moving parts or linkages and are unaffected by density changes or build up. They are also excellent with very low microwave reflectivity products like liquid gasses (LNG, LPG, Ammonia) which are stored at low temperatures/high pressures, although care needs to be taken on sealing arrangements and hazardous area approvals. On bulk solids and powders, GWR offers a great alternative to radar or ultrasonic sensors, but some care needs to be taken over cable wear and roof loading by the product movement.|$|R
