5|$|Although not poisonous, M.galopus and the {{varieties}} candida and nigra are <b>inedible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pseudoplectania nigrella is {{considered}} <b>inedible.</b> It has no distinctive taste or odor.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena acicula are {{considered}} <b>inedible,</b> {{as they are}} too small and insubstantial {{to be considered for}} consumption.|$|E
5|$|Wynnea {{americana}} has {{no discernible}} odor, and its taste is unknown. It {{has been described}} as <b>inedible</b> due to its toughness.|$|E
5|$|Another {{defense that}} often uses color or shape to deceive {{potential}} enemies is mimicry. A number of longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) bear {{a striking resemblance}} to wasps, which helps them avoid predation even though the beetles are in fact harmless. Batesian and Müllerian mimicry complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera. Genetic polymorphism and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species (the mimic) gaining a survival advantage by resembling <b>inedible</b> species (the model). Such a mimicry complex is referred to as Batesian and is most commonly known by the mimicry by the limenitidine viceroy butterfly of the <b>inedible</b> danaine monarch. Later research has discovered that the viceroy is, in fact more toxic than the monarch and this resemblance should be considered as a case of Müllerian mimicry. In Müllerian mimicry, <b>inedible</b> species, usually within a taxonomic order, find it advantageous to resemble each other so as to reduce the sampling rate by predators who need to learn about the insects' inedibility. Taxa from the toxic genus Heliconius form one of the most well known Müllerian complexes.|$|E
5|$|Mycologist Roger Phillips {{claims that}} L.blennius is edible when cooked, but not recommended, while others {{describe}} it as <b>inedible</b> or even poisonous. The milk tastes very hot and acrid.|$|E
5|$|Pholiota flammans fruit bodies bear no {{distinctive}} {{smell and}} taste mild to slightly bitter. Opinions are divided as to its edibility, however, as some authors regard the mushroom as <b>inedible,</b> while others consider it edible or of unknown edibility.|$|E
5|$|Scales play an {{important}} part in the natural history of Lepidoptera. Scales enable the development of vivid or indistinct patterns which help the organism protect itself by camouflage, mimicry and warning. Besides providing insulation, dark patterns on wings allow sunlight to be absorbed and are probably involved in thermoregulation. Bright and distinctive colour patterns in butterflies which are distasteful to predators help communicate their toxicity or inedibility, thus preventing predation. In Batesian mimicry, wing colour patterns help edible lepidopterans mimic <b>inedible</b> models, while in Müllerian mimicry, <b>inedible</b> butterflies resemble each other to reduce the numbers of individuals sampled by inexperienced predators.|$|E
5|$|While some list S.scutellata as <b>inedible,</b> others list it {{as having}} an unknown edibility. David Arora {{considers}} it {{too small to be}} of any culinary interest, and it lacks a distinctive smell or taste.|$|E
5|$|Battarrea phalloides (as well as Battarrea stevenii) is {{typically}} described as unknown edibility, or <b>inedible.</b> In Cyprus, the immature egg-form {{of the fruit}} body is eaten. Older specimens may smell unpleasant. The spores of B.stevenii are used as a cicatrizant—a product that promotes healing through the formation of scar tissue–by the Criollo herdsmen of Gran Chaco in northern Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Cortinarius violaceus {{mushrooms}} are considered edible, {{but they are}} not choice; instead, the primary appeal of the species to mushroom hunters, according to Arora, is its beauty. Its similarity to some other (<b>inedible</b> or toxic) webcaps renders it risky to eat. The taste after cooking is reportedly bitter.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum quadrifidum, {{commonly}} known as the rayed earthstar or four-footed earthstar, is an <b>inedible</b> species of mushroom belonging to the genus Geastrum, or earthstar fungi. First described scientifically by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1794, G.quadrifidum is a cosmopolitan—but not common—species of Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australasia. The fungus is a saprobe, feeding off decomposing organic matter present in the soil and litter of coniferous forests.|$|E
5|$|It is Thanksgiving and Lisa assembles a {{decorative}} centerpiece for the dinner table. Meanwhile, Homer leaves {{to pick up}} Grampa from the retirement home once Patty and Selma arrive, bearing food (Swedish meatballs), and to Marge's consternation they insinuate that they find Marge's turkeys are dry and <b>inedible.</b> Their mother Jaqueline Bouvier arrives in a taxi, suffering from laryngitis, and tells Marge she never does anything right.|$|E
5|$|This fungus is <b>inedible,</b> as it {{contains}} the toxic compound gyromitrin, which when digested is metabolized into monomethylhydrazine, {{a major component}} of rocket fuel. Although much of the gyromitrin may be removed by parboiling with generous volumes of water, consumption is not advisable due to possible long-term health effects—there is evidence that even small doses of gyromitrin may have a cumulative carcinogenic effect.|$|E
5|$|According to the International Energy Agency, {{cellulosic}} ethanol biorefineries {{could allow}} biofuels {{to play a}} much bigger role in the future than {{organizations such as the}} IEA previously thought. Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of <b>inedible</b> cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism {{has also}} led to the {{development}} of mimicry complexes of Batesian mimicry, where edible species mimic aposematic taxa, and Müllerian mimicry, where <b>inedible</b> species, often of related taxa, have evolved to resemble each other, so as to benefit from reduced sampling rates by predators during learning. Similarly, adult Sesiidae species (also known as clearwing moths) have a general appearance that is sufficiently similar to a wasp or hornet to make it likely that the moths gain a reduction in predation by Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy enabled by changes in body shape, colour and markings. Some lepidopterans blend with the surroundings, making them difficult to be spotted by predators. Caterpillars can be shades of green that match their host plant. Others resemble <b>inedible</b> objects, such as twigs or leaves. The larvae of some species, such as the common Mormon and the western tiger swallowtail look like bird droppings.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{is common}} and {{widespread}} among beetle families, {{especially those that}} feed on wood or vegetation, such as leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae, which are often green) and weevils. In some species, sculpturing or various coloured scales or hairs cause beetles such as the avocado weevil Heilipus apiatus to resemble bird dung or other <b>inedible</b> objects. Many beetles that live in sandy environments {{blend in with the}} coloration of that substrate.|$|E
5|$|French mycologist Pierre Bulliard {{described}} this species as Boletus felleus in 1788 {{before it was}} transferred into the new genus Tylopilus. It is the type species of Tylopilus, and {{the only member of}} the genus found in Europe. Tylopilus felleus has been the subject of research into bioactive compounds that have been tested for antitumour and antibiotic properties. Although not poisonous, it is generally considered <b>inedible,</b> due to its overwhelming bitterness.In Vietnam it's considered as a delicacy.This species often found in Phu Quoc island.|$|E
5|$|Growing in {{woodland}} among moss, {{plant detritus}} or other habitats, the L.lubrica fruit bodies are typically found in large numbers, though they can grow in tight clumps or even individually. The species feeds as a saprotroph. The youngest fruit bodies {{are small and}} conical, but the fertile head quickly grows from the stalk. It {{is often described as}} <b>inedible,</b> despite its common name, but has also been reported as edible and even good. L.lubrica has been recorded in Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum peckii is an <b>inedible</b> (though not toxic) fungus, and {{a member}} of the genus Hydnellum of the family Bankeraceae. It is a hydnoid species, {{producing}} spores on the surface of vertical spines or tooth-like projections that hang from the undersurface of the fruit bodies. It is found in North America, Europe, and was recently discovered in Iran (2008) and Korea (2010). Hydnellum peckii is a mycorrhizal species, and forms mutually beneficial relationships with a variety of coniferous trees, growing on the ground singly, scattered, or in fused masses.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus milk has a {{very hot}} taste, and the {{mushroom}} lacks a distinctive smell. Although described by many mycologists as <b>inedible,</b> David Pegler claims that its acrid taste can be removed after boiling, allowing it to be consumed. Though the strong, acrid taste is {{a defining feature of}} the species, it is weaker or even absent in some older mushrooms, which is not unusual for Lactarius species. Occasionally, however, mushrooms of the species have been collected which have a mild taste; this has also been observed in other species with typically acrid tastes.|$|E
5|$|Notably, {{terrestrial}} mammals, including horses (Equus ferus caballus), goats (Capra aegagrus hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), cats (Felis catus), {{and brown}} rats (Rattus norvegicus), are fairly {{common in the}} stomach contents of tiger sharks around the coasts of Hawaii. In one case, remains of two flying foxes {{were found in the}} stomach of this shark. Because of its aggressive and indiscriminate feeding style, it often mistakenly eats <b>inedible</b> objects, such as automobile license plates, oil cans, tires, and baseballs.|$|E
5|$|Stropharia caerulea, {{commonly}} known as the blue roundhead, is an <b>inedible</b> species of agaric fungus in the family Strophariaceae. It is a common species found in Europe and North America, where it grows as a saprophyte in meadows, roadsides, hedgerows, gardens, and woodchip mulch. S.caerulea was officially described to science in 1979, although it was known to be a distinct species for about two centuries before that. The taxon Stropharia cyanea, as defined by Risto Tuomikoski in 1953, and used by several later authors, is a synonym of S.caerulea.|$|E
5|$|This {{mushroom}} is edible {{but very}} peppery. The Italian chef Antonio Carluccio recommends only {{using it to}} add flavour to other mushrooms. It {{has been used as}} a condiment in many countries. The mushroom should be well-cooked before consumption to minimize the risk of gastric symptoms; the peppery taste is lost with cooking. In powdered form, it loses its peppery taste quickly. Some guidebooks classify C.piperatus as <b>inedible.</b> Fruit bodies can be used for mushroom dyeing; depending on the mordant used, yellow, orange, or greenish-brown dyes can be made.|$|E
5|$|Botanists {{study how}} plants produce food {{and how to}} {{increase}} yields, for example through plant breeding, making their work important to mankind's ability to feed the world and provide food security for future generations. Botanists also study weeds, which are a considerable problem in agriculture, and the biology and control of plant pathogens in agriculture and natural ecosystems. Ethnobotany {{is the study of}} the relationships between plants and people. When applied to the investigation of historical plant–people relationships ethnobotany may be referred to as archaeobotany or palaeoethnobotany. Some of the earliest plant-people relationships arose between the indigenous people of Canada in identifying edible plants from <b>inedible</b> plants. This relationship the indigenous people had with plants was recorded by ethnobotanists.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a similar}} overall appearance, A.hygrometricus {{is not related}} to the true earthstars of genus Geastrum, {{although}} historically, they have been taxonomically confused. The species was first described by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801 as Geastrum hygrometricus. In 1885, Andrew P. Morgan proposed that differences in microscopic characteristics warranted {{the creation of a new}} genus Astraeus distinct from Geastrum; this opinion was not universally accepted by later authorities. Several Asian populations formerly thought to be A.hygrometricus were renamed in the 2000s once phylogenetic analyses revealed they were unique Astraeus species, including A.asiaticus and A.odoratus. Research has revealed the presence of several bioactive chemical compounds in the fruit bodies. North American field guides typically rate A.hygrometricus as <b>inedible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Entoloma murrayi, {{commonly}} known as the yellow unicorn Entoloma or the unicorn pinkgill, is a species of fungus in the Entolomataceae family. First described from New England (USA) in 1859, the species is found in eastern North America, Central and South America, and southeast Asia, where it grows on the ground in wet coniferous and deciduous forests. The fungus produces yellow mushrooms that have a characteristic sharp umbo {{on the top of a}} conical cap. The mushroom is <b>inedible</b> and may be poisonous. Other similar species can be distinguished from E.murrayi by differences in color, morphology, or microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Galiella rufa, {{commonly}} known as the rubber cup, the rufous rubber cup, or the hairy rubber cup, is a species of fungus in the family Sarcosomataceae. The fungus produces cup-shaped fruit bodies that typically grow in clusters on branches and exposed portions of buried wood throughout eastern and Midwest North America and in Malaysia. The fruit bodies have the texture of tough, gelatinous rubber, and have a rough, blackish-brown, felt-like outer surface and a smooth reddish-brown inner surface. Although generally considered <b>inedible</b> by North American mushroom field guides, it is commonly consumed in Malaysia. The fungus produces several chemicals with a variety of bioactive properties.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Africa, termites are consumed in local or tribal areas in Asia and North and South America. In Australia, Indigenous Australians {{are aware that}} termites are edible but do not consume them even in times of scarcity; there are few explanations as to why. Termite mounds are the main sources of soil consumption (geophagy) in many countries including Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Researchers have suggested that termites are suitable candidates for human consumption and space agriculture, as they are high in protein {{and can be used}} to convert <b>inedible</b> waste to consumable products for humans.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe praetervisa is a small, {{yellow and}} brown {{mushroom}} in the Inocybaceae family, distinguished from {{other members of}} the genus by its unusual spores and bulb. The unusual spores led to the species being named the type species of the now-abandoned genus Astrosporina; recent studies have shown that such a genus could not exist, as the species with the defining traits do not form a monophyletic group. However, it is a part of several clades within the genus Inocybe. I.praetervisa grows on the ground in woodland, favouring beech trees, and can be found in Europe, North America and Asia. It is <b>inedible</b> and probably poisonous due to the presence of muscarine. The ingestion of muscarine can lead to SLUDGE syndrome, and could potentially lead to death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius blennius (commonly {{known as}} the Slimy Milkcap or Beech Milkcap) is a {{medium-sized}} mushroom of the genus Lactarius found commonly in beech forests in Europe, where it is mycorrhizal, favouring the European Beech (though associations with other trees are known). It was first described by Elias Magnus Fries. Though its colour and size vary, it is distinctive because it is slimy when wet and exudes copious amounts of milk. It {{has been the subject}} of some chemical research, and it can be used to produce pigments and blennins. Blennins, some of which have shown potential medical application, are derived from lactarane, a chemical so named because of their association with Lactarius. The edibility of L.blennius is uncertain, with different mycologists suggesting that it is edible (though not recommended), <b>inedible</b> or even poisonous.|$|E
5|$|Mycena polygramma, {{commonly}} known as the grooved bonnet, is a species of mushroom in the Mycenaceae family. The <b>inedible</b> fruit bodies are small, pale gray-brown mushrooms with broadly conical caps, pinkish gills. They are found in small troops on stumps and branches of deciduous and occasionally coniferous trees. The mushroom is found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it is typically found on twigs or buried wood, carrying out its role in the forest ecosystem by decomposing organic matter, recycling nutrients, and forming humus in the soil. M.polygramma contains two uncommon hydroxy fatty acids and is also a bioluminescent fungus whose intensity of light emission follows a diurnal pattern.|$|E
5|$|Myriostoma is a fungal genus in {{the family}} Geastraceae. The genus is monotypic, {{containing}} the single species Myriostoma coliforme. It is an earthstar, so named because the spore-bearing sack's outer wall splits open {{into the shape of}} a star. The <b>inedible</b> fungus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and has been found in Africa, Asia, North and South America, and Europe, where it grows in humus-rich forests or in woodlands, especially on well-drained and sandy soils. A somewhat rare fungus, it appears on the Red Lists of 12 European countries, and in 2004 it was one of 33 species proposed for protection under the Bern Convention by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi.|$|E
5|$|The family Cucurbitaceae {{has many}} species used as human food. Cucurbita species are some {{one of the}} most {{important}} of those, with the various species being prepared and eaten in many ways. Although the stems and skins tend to be more bitter than the flesh, the fruits and seeds of cultivated varieties are quite edible and need little or no preparation. The flowers and young leaves and shoot tips can also be consumed. The seeds and fruits of most varieties can be stored for long periods of time, particularly the sweet-tasting winter varieties with their thick, <b>inedible</b> skins. Summer squash have a thin, edible skin. The seeds of both types can be roasted, eaten raw, made into pumpkin seed oil, ground into a flour or meal, or otherwise prepared.|$|E
5|$|The genus, {{with about}} 20 {{described}} species, has a distribution that includes to Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and New Zealand. About {{half of the}} species {{are found in the}} southeastern United States, including three species added to the genus in 2013–14. Several Phellodon species were placed on a preliminary Red List of threatened British fungi because of a general decline of the genus in Europe. Species grow in a symbiotic mycorrhizal association with trees from the families Fagaceae (beeches and oaks) and Pinaceae (pines). Accurate DNA-based methods have been developed to determine the presence of Phellodon species in the soil, even in the extended absence of visible fruitbodies. Although Phellodon fruitbodies are considered <b>inedible</b> due to their fibrous flesh, the type species, P.niger, is used in mushroom dyeing.|$|E
