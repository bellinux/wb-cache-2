40|$|The Master thesis {{deals with}} the issue of <b>European</b> <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> programmes. It {{outlines}} the development of <b>European</b> <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation,</b> its <b>goals</b> and objectives as its linkages to processes of evolution of <b>European</b> <b>territorial</b> development goals and documents. The involvement of Slovenia in transnational cooperation programmes and its successfulness are discussed in the paper. The thesis describes types of results delivered by projects and their further use after the projects closure. Longer lasting effects of projects and its results as its possible impacts to territorial development are treated. Some impacts are listed and the problem of observation and measurement of territorial impacts is described. Due {{to the nature of the}} project that are not investment orientated and deliver results that are thematically as geographically dispersed, observation of impacts is problematic. Master thesis deals with two working hypotheses: - Hypothesis 1 : The results of the projects are rarely directly used in the daily work of project participants after the completion of project activities. The practical application of the results is less than it could have been, or there is a difference between the projects planned and actual effects achieved. - Hypothesis 2 : Great success of Slovenian organizations to engage in projects of transnational <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> is the result of an early integration of Slovenia into transnational cooperation programs and, consequently strengthening the institutional and personal networks in projects involving project partners. In preparing the thesis descriptive methods and qualitative analysis were used as a tool for determining the effectiveness of cooperation in projects involved organizations, the reasons for their inclusion, the assessment of the performance of the integration and assessment of the applicability of the project results. The contents of the projects of transnational cooperation programs are very diverse. Most often, projects are addressing topics as environment, protection of nature and cultural heritage, disaster prevention and risk to climate change; spatial and regional development, rural development and urban development; transport, mobility and logistics, small and medium- sized enterprises and tourism related projects. Their substantive and operational differences are reflected in the large heterogeneity of the results obtained. The results of the projects and their impacts are highly geographically dispersed...|$|R

The Single European Act, that entered into force in 1987, institutionalised the goal of completing the internal market with a total borders opening, by 31 December 1992.

40|$|Whilst {{there has}} been a surge of {{interest}} in various disciplines in <b>European</b> <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> between sub-central levels of government at different scales (cross-border, transnational, inter-regional), researchers and practitioners have struggled to develop appropriate methodologies to analyse the outcomes and impacts of <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> programmes/projects. That transboundary cooperation leads to the dissemination of good practice, to policy change and to concrete territorial impacts has become accepted wisdom within European programmes, in spite of the often scarce evidence about such outcomes. This paper will build upon the notion of ‘social’ or ‘policy’ learning in order to propose a conceptual and methodological framework to investigate whether, and how, policy learning processes take place between sub-central governmental actors in the framework of <b>European</b> <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> networks and programmes, on the basis of sociological approaches to 'cognitive Europeanisation' and to organisational learning. The paper will then present the very preliminary results of two research projects on cross-border and transnational <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> in Southern Europe currently being carried out at the University Institute of European Studies, Barcelona, by proposing a brief reflection on the factors (in particular related to the notion of ‘institutional capacity’) which facilitate or impede processes of social and policy learning in transboundary cooperation projects – taking as an example the involvement of Catalan institutional actors in such projects. ...|$|R

Since 1991 – when INTERREG programme was established {{on the basis}} of the European Regional Development Fund – the {{cohesion policy}} has also included support for border areas and regional networks, mainly through development of cross-border cooperation. In the current financial perspective of the EU, the cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation is pursued as part of Objective 3 of the cohesion policy, that is the <b>European</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation</b> (ETC). Furthermore, cross-border cooperation with the partner states beyond the external EU border is supported from the funds of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.

40|$|Historically, {{cooperation}} {{across borders}} was {{an area of}} activity dominated by central government actors. However, in the EU {{some of the earliest}} institutionalised forms of <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> are based on bottom-up initiatives involving border municipalities. Current <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> arrangements continue to be strongly based upon local and regional institutions and actors. Theoretical work on Europeanisation, multi-level governance and new regionalism highlights the increased role of sub-national actors in driving economic development and participating in external networking and cooperation activities. However, the scope and diversity of programmes mean that the opportunities for local and regional partners in terms of influencing the outcomes of programmes are equally varied. There have been significant differences in governance dimensions of programmes. Key questions this paper explores are to what extent bottom-up or top-down approaches are used as well as differences in terms of centralised or localised management or implementation structures. The first part of this paper explores which actors influence key processes in the <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> cycle at which stage and how these can vary across programmes in order to assess the existence of governance dimensions. The second part of the paper builds on the first section and will specifically focus on the impact that macro-regional strategies have had and can expected to have in the future. These strategies have the potential to significantly affect established <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> programmes (such as INTERREG). However, its full implications are not fully understood. This section will also explore how these macro-regional strategies may lead to changes in governance approaches and {{have an impact on the}} types of partners that <b>European</b> <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> attracts.
