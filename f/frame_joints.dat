50|$|The {{process of}} making raised panel doors begins with gluing up panels, and then moves into cutting and {{preparing}} the frame parts. Next, the panels are cut to size and shaped. Parts and panel are sanded before construction. It is also common to apply a finish to panels prior to assembly so that raw wood is not visible if the panel shrinks. The joints are glued and set into clamps. If the frame and panel items are paint grade they are sometimes nailed at the <b>frame</b> <b>joints</b> on the reverse side. The door then moves on to finish sanding where it is brought to its final thickness, and the outside profile is added if required.|$|E

Ardeshir made dozens of designs on paper and held innumerable discussions with his engineers and craftsmen, until it was finally determined {{that the only way}} to ensure security and stability was to make the safe out of a single sheet of steel. The resultant design had altogether sixteen bends, each side of the cross-shaped sheet being folded forward and then being folded twice more (inwards) to form the front door <b>frame.</b> <b>Joints</b> were welded, not riveted, and the coffer was covered by a second sixteen-bend sheet offset to the first by 90 degrees. The door was double plated, with the lock and hinges attached to the inner plate and the joints covered by the outer plate. The total weight was 1¾ tons. Altogether three patents covered the Ardeshir design. The first safes entered the market in 1902.|$|E

Between 1 February - 5 May 1931 Stanisław Skarżyński with A.

The aircraft was nicknamed Afrykanka then (Polish: the African female), coinciding with the aircraft registration. According to J. Cynk, {{it was one of the}} first and greatest international enterprises of the Polish aviation, and it was also one of the most outstanding flights in 1931. The tour proved a durability of the Polish-built aircraft, withstanding different weather conditions and casual airstrips, during 147 flying hours, despite the engine had to be repaired twice on the way. In 7-8 June 1931 Skarżyński flew this aircraft from Poznań in a rally to Bucharest. In July 1932 it hauled Polish gliders SG-21 and SG-28 in international competition in Rhön (piloted by Skarżyński again). The aircraft was written off in autumn 1935.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on damage {{mechanics}} and failure model, a seismic damage model applying to steel reinforced high strength and high performance concrete <b>frame</b> <b>joints</b> is put forward, which takes deformation and cumulative damage into account. The damage performance of five tentative <b>frame</b> <b>joints</b> is compared and analyzed according to deformation and dissipated hysteretic energy under different loading levels, {{and the main}} influence factors on damage performance are established. The damage indexes of tentative <b>frame</b> <b>joints</b> are calculated, {{and the influence of}} strength grade of concrete and axial compression ratio on damage performance is discussed. The results indicate that the general damage is controlled by the damage of concrete in the earlier stage of loading, and by the damage of shape steel and stirrup in the later stage of loading; joints with lower axial compression ratio and lower concrete strength grade possess better hysteretic energy performance. Damage analysis provides an available means for the research of steel reinforced high strength and high performance concrete <b>frame</b> <b>joints</b> under seismic load. The damage model presented can be a reference for seismic damage analysis of the structure, prediction of earthquake damage in future, estimation of economic loss and repair after earthquake...|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitivity}} {{study was}} performed with a nonlinear elastic {{finite element model}} for monotonic analyses of wood-framed shear walls. The objective was {{to provide information about}} simplifying a model of wood-framed shear walls with no significant loss in accuracy. The simplifications concern features such as slips in joints between frame members, slips in hold-down connections, and bearing between adjacent sheathing panels. The results from analyses of a shear wall with an opening of window shape show that the effect of constraint by the bearing between sheathing panels and slips in <b>frame</b> <b>joints</b> on the overall stiffness of the wall is limited. Thus, there are great possibilities for reducing the calculation time by not taking these phenomena into account, avoiding an excessive number of degrees of freedom and iterations. The influence of the simplifications on the distribution of vertical reaction forces along the wall is more significant. Furthermore, if each simplification is introduced separately, the effect on the overall stiffness is greater. The difference, however, is less than 10 %. The failing pattern of the nail connections is also clearly influenced by the simplifications when they are introduced separately. The results from the analyses show that slips in <b>frame</b> <b>joints</b> can be sufficiently represented by those in connection with the opening...|$|E

50|$|Many printers, {{originally}} those {{influenced by}} the RepRap project, make extensive use of 3D printed components in their own construction. These are typically printed connector blocks {{with a variety of}} angled holes, joined by cheap steel threaded rod. This makes a construction that is cheap and easy to assemble, easily allows non-perpendicular <b>framing</b> <b>joints,</b> but does require access to a 3D printer. The notion of 'bootstrapping' 3D printers like this has been something of a dogmatic theme within the RepRap designs. The lack of stiffness in the rod also requires either triangulation, or gives the risk of a gantry structure that flexes and vibrates in service, reducing print quality.|$|R
40|$|Strengthening or {{retrofitting}} existing {{structures in}} order to increase their ductility and improve their seismic response has traditionally been accomplished using conventional materials and construction techniques. Composite materials of a polymeric matrix reinforced with long fibres (FRP) have emerged as an alternative to these methods. To view the performance of these reinforcements when seismic loads are applied, this work studies the structural response of a <b>frame</b> <b>joint</b> when a horizontal load is applied to it. Under a seismic load, joints are one of the weakest parts of these structures. The response of a plain concrete <b>frame</b> <b>joint</b> is compared with the response obtained when it is reinforced using FRP. Different configurations of FRP reinforcements are considered to compare their behaviour. The structural response of all structures considered is obtained with a numerical simulation. This is done using the finite element method. Composites are treated using the mixing theory, which obtains the composite behaviour by means of the composition of each component material properties. Each component is simulated with its own constitutive equation. The anisotropy usually found in composite components is treated using a mapped space theory. The debounding effects found in composite materials are treated using the formulation developed by E. Car and S. Oller [Car, 2000]. The results obtained validate the use of FRP reinforcements to improve frames seismic response. The structure load capacity is increased in a 20 % when lateral reinforcements are applied to the joint. This can avoid the structure to collapse in a seismic case. They results also show a good performance of the numerical tool developed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{variation}} of reinforcement details, confinement and joints angle are considerable factors which affect the ultimate limit moment of joints and joints efficiency. The {{variation of}} joint size is {{another factor that}} significantly affects the ultimate limit moment of joints and <b>frame</b> <b>joints</b> efficiency. These previous factors were not considered in design. Corners may be subjected to closing moments, which subject to tensile stresses in {{the outside of the}} corner, or to opening moments, which cause tensile stresses in the inside of the corner. The last type of moments arise more detailing problems. Opening joints may be found in retaining walls water tanks, open channels, bridge abutments, high rises due to wind effect, frame structures, etc. in the other hand the closing joint may be found in two hinged and fixed frames and underground water tanks. Hence two types of joints should be compared. The presented paper introduces an experimental and analytical study in order to investigate the effect of reinforcement details, confinement, joints size, joints angle on the <b>frame</b> <b>joints</b> efficiency and comparison between closing joints and opening joints. Experimentally, a total of eleven specimens were tested under vertical load. All specimens were tested up to failure and the behaviour was fully monitored.
