5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|One {{commonly}} held misconception connected to Dyer {{is that he}} holds the second longest unbeaten record of fights of any boxer in world history, after fellow Welsh fighter Jimmy Wilde. This information was published in Nat Fleischer's The Ring: Record Book And Boxing Encyclopedia, in which it states Dyer fought 94 unbeaten fights between 1908 and 1912. Although <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Dyer may have boxed 94 fights between these years, and may have turned professional in 1908, it is widely accepted that his fight with Dick Emden in 1911 in which he dislocated his knee was a loss. This therefore challenges Fleischer's claim.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in working memory. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity in other studies.|$|E

These wars were waged off and on from 1256 to 1289, 1296 to 1299, and from 1345 to 1422, although <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> a state of war continued to exist between the County of Holland and the Frisian territories till well after the year 1500.|$|E

Johns neutralized the subject, so that something like a pure painted surface could declare itself.

Fulci was most likely resentful of Argento since Argento had always received critical acclaim and recognition in Italy and abroad, whereas Fulci had been regarded there as something of a horror film hack. Fulci always joked that when he died, the Italian newspapers would all misspell his name, if they even mentioned him at all.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{radio was}} born in Cornwall. In 1901 at Poldhu on The Lizard, Guglielmo Marconi made his first trans-atlantic radio transmission.

The transmission, coming {{a long way from}} Cornwall, (from the centre of the English Midlands), was crackly and barely audible at night-time, and it was a solitary listening experience, as sets were only equipped with a single earpiece, and not a loudspeaker.|$|E

Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> previous misrepresentations about Byzantium being simply a 'carrier' of Ancient Medical knowledge to the Renaissance are wrong.

25|$|Because of {{the larger}} geopolitical {{conjecture}} {{of the time and}} the lack of a formal declaration of a republic, it failed to mention anything about the role the Sultan might play under this new constitution.

On hindsight, however, it is clear that this omission was on purpose awaiting the outcome of the Independence War and the cessation of hostilities before the proclamation of the Republic.|$|E

50|$|Cringe {{comedy is}} a {{specific}} genre of comedy that derives humor from social awkwardness.
