5|$|Four-wheel {{drive was}} decided against {{early in the}} {{development}} process, {{for a number of}} reasons. It was thought rear-wheel drive would be adequate in the majority of situations, that the additional complexity of the four-wheel drive system would hinder the development process and potentially be problematic <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>customer.</b> FF Developments were contracted to provide the gearbox/transaxle assembly, modifying their four-wheel drive transaxle assembly from the XJ220 concept into a pure rear-wheel drive design for the production car. A five-speed gearbox is fitted; a six-speed gearbox was considered but deemed unnecessary, as the torque characteristics of the engine made a sixth gear redundant. The transaxle featured a viscous coupling limited slip differential to improve traction.|$|E

The venture was officially founded in 1974. The two primary roles for CFMI were to manage the program between GE and SNECMA, and to market, sell and service the engine at a single point of contact <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>customer.</b> CFMI was made responsible for the day-to-day decision making for the project, while major decisions (developing a new variant, for example) required the go-ahead from GE and SNECMA management.|$|E
5|$|Service design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of service design. It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim {{is to improve the}} quality of the service, the interaction between the service provider and its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size of the service sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive and to continue to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses in the design and development of manufactured products; service design managers can apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of service design helps the business gain competitive advantages and conquer new markets. Companies that proactively identify the interests of their customers and use this information to develop services that create good experiences <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> will open up new and profitable business opportunities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we present an {{application}} that man-ufacturers and retailers {{can use to}} provide contextual product information <b>for</b> their <b>customers.</b> <b>The</b> application also provides a direct interactive feedback channel that <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> can use in asking questions about the products from the manufacturers and retailers. In addition to that the application also offers functionality <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> to discuss about the products amongst themselves. The application consists of a web interface <b>for</b> <b>the</b> manufacturers and retailers and both a web interface and a mobile Java application <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers.</b> We conclude {{that this kind of}} an application has clear benefits <b>for</b> both <b>the</b> manufacturers and retailers as well as <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>customers</b> get guidance and assistance in using the products and the manufacturers and retailers get valuable information that they can use in their product development. We also discuss some potential difficulties that the concept might face.

25|$|Others have {{suggested}} that fractional pricing was first adopted as a control on employee theft. For cash transactions with a round price, {{there is a chance}} that a dishonest cashier will pocket the bill rather than record the sale. For cash transactions with an odd price, the cashier must make change <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>customer.</b> This generally means opening the cash register which creates a record of the sale in the register and reduces the risk of the cashier stealing from the store owner.|$|E
25|$|As {{the number}} of shops grew, they {{underwent}} a transformation. The trappings of a modern shop, which had been entirely absent from the sixteenth and early seventeenth century store, gradually made way for store interiors that are more familiar to modern shops. Prior to the eighteenth century, there were no counters, display cases, chairs, mirrors, changing-rooms, etc. However, the opportunity <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> to browse merchandise, touch and feel products began to be available, with retail innovations from the late 17th and early 18th centuries.|$|E
25|$|Xfinity Voice allows {{communication}} {{over the}} internet using VoIP, but uses a private network instead of a public IP address, which allows Comcast to prioritize the voice data during heavy traffic. In technical terms, on Comcast's Hybrid Fiber Coaxial network, calls are placed into individual Unsolicited Grant Service flows, based on DOCSIS 1.1 Quality of service standards. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>customer,</b> this has the benefit of preventing network congestion from interfering with call quality. However, this separation of traffic into separate flows, or Smart pipe, has been seen {{by some as a}} violation of net neutrality, who call instead for equal treatment of all data, or dumb pipe. Other, non-Comcast VoIP services on Comcast's network must use the lower priority public IP addresses. The practice was questioned by the FCC in 2009. In their response, Comcast stated that services that use telecommunications are not necessarily telecommunications services, and noted the FCC's current designation of Comcast Digital Voice as an information service exempted it from telecommunications service regulations. Comcast also said that because Comcast Voice was a separate service, it was unfair to directly compare the data for Comcast Voice with the data for other VoIP services.|$|E

[...] They can also be performed with the customer standing in these designated areas. [...] A service provided by many clubs is for a customer {{to be placed on}} stage with one or more dancers for a public lap dance. [...] Occasions for this type of performance are bachelor parties and birthdays, among others. Bed dance areas require more space because they are designed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> to be prone with the entertainer(s) positioned on top of them.

Why does it think it can do this with Diamond's DA40—a {{comparable}} proven and competent airplane—sells for around $350,000? One reason is that it builds airplanes in the Ukraine, where labor rates are lower. But another may be that it hasn't certified a four-place airplane in the current market and is doing what most airplane companies do: underestimating the cost of bringing a new airplane into production. I wish them the best, but I'd rather see a realistic price that builds in {{the most important thing}} any new airplane should have: Good value <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> and profitability for the company building the airplane.
