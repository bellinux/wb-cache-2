The designer talked {{of what was to}} happen to the dress after the awards show, [...] "The dress will be put in an archive with all of her dresses. The Gaga Archives, I suppose. It won't last, that's the beauty of it. When it is brought out again, hopefully it will be in a retrospective, {{and it will be a}} different dress, which is the best thing. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> it changing and evolving into something else". He later explained that the dress would be preserved and made into a type of jerky before being archived.|$|E
500|$|According to Ocean, {{the music}} video for [...] "Novacane" [...] {{was a simple}} process. Talking about {{the concept of the}} video, he stated [...] "I was just trying to connect or {{articulate}} visually the feeling of being numb. The feeling of wanting to feel something you can't feel. A lot of things can cause that numbing, but in the video it was some sort of topical aesthetic {{and a little bit of}} special effects." [...] The video doesn't last the entirety of the song, which director Nabil Elderkin stated was for artistic reasons. In an interview with Pitchfork, he reasoned [...] "to me, videos don't always have to be the length of the song. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> people thinking, 'What was that?'" ...|$|E
500|$|The song makes direct {{reference}} to FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), {{the two main}} characters of the popular sci-fi TV series The X-Files who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Although the title and refrain reference the popular show, the song {{has little to do}} with the two characters. The use of Mulder and Scully are used to represent a metaphor for a relationship being so [...] "strange" [...] that it could be [...] "a case for Mulder and Scully", a {{reference to}} the paranormal cases—the titular X-Files—the two investigate on the show. Cerys Matthews, the co-writer of the song, explained that the conceit of the song was [...] "about asking Mulder and Scully to figure out this thing called love. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> two people going round the planet investigating odd phenomena, in this case love".|$|E

500|$|Lytle {{also noted}} that he was likely to record a new Grandaddy album, stating, [...] "It's {{probably}} going to happen.... If anyone knows anything about Grandaddy, they realise that my [...] music and Grandaddy's music is slightly interchangeable. I think if I were to focus on making a Grandaddy record [...] a full-blown Grandaddy record, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> that. I'd like {{to give it a}} shot." [...] In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: [...] "I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going {{to get out there and}} tour in support of it?'... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff that goes along with it. I already did that and it's just not appealing to me any more." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{interlude}} {{was followed}} by a Cabaret-like performance of [...] "Hanky Panky", which started the Circus act. Next a jazz version of [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] was performed with her two female back-up dancers. Then followed [...] "Die Another Day", with Madonna and her dancers in a Tango-like choreography and backdrops displayed an old man in his deathbed. After that, she was strapped into an electric chair as she started singing [...] "Lament" [...] from the soundtrack of the film Evita and the platform rises with her to the top. Madonna commented later that [...] "Lament" [...] was her [...] "favorite part, [...] <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> being restrained. I'm singing about all the things I could have had, but my ego got in the way and I destroyed all my happiness." [...] The Orbital remix/video interlude of [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] was performed as dancers swung on trapezes. An acoustic-style segment started with [...] "Nothing Fails", with the guitar being played by Madonna herself. After that, she sang [...] "Don't Tell Me", recreating the choreography from the song's video with her dancers. The next song played was [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] where symbols of the 72 names of God were displayed on the backdrops. During the performance of the combined [...] "Mother and Father", Catholic images along with Madonna's Mother were displayed on the backdrops. Madonna then performed John Lennon's pro-peace song [...] "Imagine" [...] when photo montages of war-ravaged children, bombed-out villages and artillery were displayed in the backdrops. Asked why she chose to cover this song Madonna simply said: [...] "I wanted to make a statement with the ultimate peace song." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the KLF's {{retirement}} announcement, Drummond's old friend and colleague David Balfe said of Drummond's KLF career that [...] "the path he's trod is a more artistic one than mine.

5000|$|RUBY chose {{abuse and}} neglect as a key theme as she [...] "...was really {{interested}} in taking on {{a different type of}} narrator. Most of my girls are from upper middle class families, living in pretty solid environments. I was intrigued by taking a girl who WASN'T like that at all and dropping her into this whole new world. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that you'd think it would solve all her problems—having a roof over her head, money, a family—but that it actually brought up a whole other set to deal with. Also, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of my narrator having to sort of [...] "save" [...] someone else in order to save herself." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "I think it's {{great that}} EastEnders {{has done this}} storyline, {{because it would be}} totally wrong and remiss not to {{acknowledge}} the biggest event in our lifetime, which technically—in fictional land—is five minutes up the road from Walford." [...] Roger Mosey, the BBC's director for London 2012, said, [...] "I like this, in media terms, that it's the real torch, the real procession going to Walford. It will be live when it goes there and so potentially you can broadcast EastEnders for three or four minutes on the News Channel because the torch being in Albert Square is a news event. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the real torch being in a fictional place." ...|$|E
2500|$|Marr's jangly guitar-playing was {{influenced}} by Neil Young's work with Crazy Horse, George Harrison (with The Beatles) and James Honeyman-Scott of The Pretenders. During his time in The Smiths, Marr often tuned his guitar up a full step to F-sharp to accommodate Morrissey's vocal range, and also used open tunings. Citing producer Phil Spector as an influence, Marr said, [...] "I {{like the idea of}} records, even those with plenty of space, that sound 'symphonic'. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> all the players merging into one atmosphere".

2500|$|A guitar-dominated album, its {{musical styles}} range from thrash, art pop and power pop to {{psychedelic}} folk featuring acoustic guitar. Pitchfork described Red Barked Tree as a [...] "shrewdly sequenced album", a necessity {{arising from the}} variety of different styles represented on it: [...] "its 11 songs {{are more or less}} positioned along a logical arc, where a sense of ominous unease gives way to violent release before simmering into a peaceful comedown". Grey stated in an interview with The Quietus, [...] "I was asked to propose a track sequence for the album, and I found it difficult initially. Then I realised that if I thought of the tracks as a series of scenes in a play or a film, it made it easier. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the tracks telling a story: the story was the album from beginning to end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Director Terry Gilliam and screenwriter Charles McKeown {{wrote the}} script for The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, their first {{collaboration}} since The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988). When he was approached with the basic concept by Gilliam, McKeown thought of the central character of Parnassus [...] "as a semi-eastern medicine man evolved", and in retrospect he further said about the script's sensibilities, [...] "t is about the theme of imagination, {{and the importance of}} imagination, to how you live and how you think and so on. And that's very much a Terry theme. [...] <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> storytelling being the thing that sustains the universe." [...] Gilliam described the premise as a [...] "fun and humorous story about the consequences of our personal choices in life", and explained his goal for the film: [...] "It's autobiographical. I'm trying to bring a bit of fantasticality to London, an antidote to modern lives. I loved this idea of an ancient travelling show offering the kind of storytelling and wonder that we used to get, to people who are just into shoot-em-up action films." [...] Gilliam and McKeown based the character of Tony on former British prime minister Tony Blair, who [...] "would say the most insane things and probably he'd believe them himself".|$|E

6000|$|You cannot imagine, Clarinda (<b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Arcadian {{names in}} a {{commerce}} of this kind), how much store I have {{set by the}} hopes of your future friendship. I {{do not know if}} you have a just idea of my character, but I wish you to see me as I am. I am, as most people of my trade are, a strange Will-o'-Wisp being: the victim, too frequently, of much imprudence and many follies. My great constituent elements are pride and passion. The first I have endeavoured to humanise into integrity and honour; the last makes me a devotee to the warmest degree of enthusiasm, in love, religion, or friendship--either of them, or all together, as I happen to be inspired. 'Tis true, I never saw you but once; but how much acquaintance did I form with you in that once? Do not think I flatter you, or have a design upon you, Clarinda; I have too much pride for the one, and too little cold contrivance for the other; but of all God's creatures I ever could approach in the beaten way of my acquaintance, you struck me with the deepest, the strongest, the most permanent impression. I say the most permanent, because I know myself well, and how far I can promise either on my prepossessions or powers. Why are you unhappy? And why are so many of our fellow-creatures, unworthy to belong to the same species with you, blest with all they can wish? You have a hand all benevolent to give-why were you denied the pleasure? You have a heart formed--gloriously formed--for all the most refined luxuries of love:-why was that heart ever wrung? O Clarinda! shall we not meet in a state, some yet unknown state of being, where the lavish hand of plenty shall minister to the highest wish of benevolence; and where the chill north-wind of prudence shall never blow over the flowery fields of enjoyment? If we do not, man was made in vain! I deserved most of the unhappy hours that have lingered over my head; they were the wages of my labour: but what unprovoked demon, malignant as hell, stole upon the confidence of unmistrusting busy Fate, and dashed your cup of life with undeserved sorrow? ...|$|E
40|$|The {{abstract}} pieces I create now {{are part}} of an ongoing evolution in my work to arrive at a visual balance between rigid structure and organic movement. Initially, they were intended as a departure from representational imagery to allow for more focus on color harmonies and structural balance. After more than twenty-five years of rendering objects and things, it became too predictable and “safe” for me to take my work seriously. 	As {{it has been suggested that}} most abstraction derives from reality in some form, I was intrigued by those rings of light we see when closing our eyes. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of appropriating an archetypal image that was neither real nor unreal. 	Through the painting process, I have come to appreciate how a dialogue can be generated between the formal, visual elements, and the intuitive, more instinctive realm of aesthetics. Spontaneity and deliberate avoidance of pre-conceived imagery are important to me. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that ambiguity can create an environment for open interpretation.
