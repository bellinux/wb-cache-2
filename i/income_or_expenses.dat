It defines over-indebtedness from {{a customer}} protection perspective and considers borrowers over-indebted if they continuously struggle with repayment and experience unacceptable sacrifices {{related to their}} debt.

The risk of over-indebtedness further increases with the occurrence of adverse economic shocks to a borrower’s <b>income</b> <b>or</b> <b>expenses.</b> The likelihood of over-indebtedness is higher for borrowers with low returns on their investment and if borrowers use loans, at least in part, for non-productive purposes. It is higher for borrowers with a low, debt-specific financial literacy. General financial literacy has negative effects on over-indebtedness. We find no effect for mere numeracy.

The negative effects of the economic crisis are well known: Increase of unemployment rate, sharp decrease of incomes because of the imposed political measures and decrease of purchasing power resulting in a decrease of the quality of life. The quality of life may be assessed based on several macroeconomic indicators, such as: GD per capita, population <b>incomes</b> <b>or</b> <b>expenses,</b> population consumption, indicators that are the foundation of the analyses that may help taking decisions regarding the social and economic policies aimed to the increase of the standard of living. Although Eurostat data show that, despite appearances, the economic well-being of the Romanian population has increased during the period of economic crisis, it is in fact related to the social polarisation.

40|$|Objectives: Previous {{research}} has examined {{costs associated with}} progressive neurological illnesses, but has not examined predictors of economic pressure, or quality of life (QOL). The aim {{of the current study}} was to examine the predictors of both economic pressure and QOL among people with a range of progressive neurological illness. Method: Participants were 257 people with motor neurone disease, Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s. Results: High levels of cut backs in spending predicted economic pressure for all groups. Economic pressure predicted QOL at 12 -month follow-up for all groups except Parkinson’s. For Parkinson’s, predictors of QOL were long duration of illness, illness-related expenses and cut backs in spending. Cut backs in spending, and not <b>income</b> <b>or</b> <b>expenses,</b> were the most important predictor of economic pressure. QOL was predicted by high levels of economic pressure for most of the illness groups. Discussion: The implications of these findings are discussed. They suggest that cut backs in spending, as opposed to income and expenses, are important factors to focus on assisting people to adjust to the changes to their financial situation that frequently occurs after developing one of these progressive neurological illnesses. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{improvements}} in enrolment rates in recent decades, the Peruvian school system still has serious shortcomings. A high drop-out rate in secondary school {{stems from the}} fact that the system does not provide adequate support for students who fall behind, cannot afford to go to school, or would rather work than continue their education. The situation becomes particularly difficult for households who face economic shocks that force them to reassign time and money away from education. This paper studies the effect of economic shocks on household investment patterns in Peru using a sample of 6 - to 14 -year-old children going through the Peruvian education system. Most studies that have tried to determine the effect of economic shocks on human capital (investment in education, skills training, health, and well-being) have focused on an analysis of changes in school enrolment. The authors here suggest a more comprehensive analysis of the possible mechanisms through which investment in education can be affected. The conclusions presented here support the hypothesis that shocks have an impact on the quality, rather than the length, of education. The evidence shows that shocks do not necessarily effect the school drop-out rate or the rate of ‘over-age schooling’ (of children at least one year older than the age expected for their grade). The evidence does demonstrate, however, that negative shocks do reduce the effective accumulation of human capital through cuts in spending on education, in both urban and rural areas. Results are significant both when a short-term shock is brought about by changes in household <b>income</b> <b>or</b> <b>expenses</b> and when it is brought about by changes in employment status. ...|$|E
40|$|Transfer pricing {{continues}} to be, and will remain, {{the most important}} international tax issue facing MNEs. ' The term 'transfer pricing' is used to describe arrangements involving the transfer of goods or services, at an artificial price, in order to transfer <b>income</b> <b>or</b> <b>expenses</b> from one enterprise to an associated enterprise in a different tax jurisdiction. This results in the income derived at for each enterprise being disproportionate to their relative economic contributions, and thus impacting the relevant tax jurisdictions' fair share of tax. Tax authorities are therefore focusing their attention on transfer pricing rules and practices to ensure the correct attribution of income and expenses of related-party transactions. Another key issue, closely related to transfer pricing, is that of double taxation. Multinational enterprises, engaging in cross-border transactions, {{are at risk of}} having a single source of income taxed in two jurisdictions {{as a result of an}} incorrect application of transfer pricing rules. The purpose of this research is to evaluate South Africa's approach to transfer pricing, as well as compare it to the approaches as adopted by selected countries, namely Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada, with the aim of identifying the areas that South Africa could learn from practices in foreign jurisdictions. Specific issues dealt with include acceptable transfer pricing methods for determining an arm's length price, documentation requirements and non-compliance penalties, the use of Advance Pricing Agreements ("APA"), and the effects of e-commerce in applying the arm's length principle. The first issue relates to the criteria for the selection of the most suitable method in ensuring an arm's length outcome. Because the South African market is considered to be lacking in comparables, compliance with the arm's length principle will be determined by evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each case. The second issue looks at the transfer pricing policy documentation required to be prepared, the benefits of preparing such documentation, and the imposition of penalties on taxpayers failing to do so. The lack of statutory documentation requirements and specific penalty provisions in the South African legislation is also addressed. The third issue evaluates the use of APAs in resolving transfer pricing disputes. This technique is adopted by Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada, and therefore an assessment is made, taking into account both advantages and disadvantages of the technique, to determine whether it would be beneficial to South Africa to be able to agree in advance to transfer pricing methods to be applied to transactions with connected parties, thus reducing the potential for expensive and time consuming disputes with the South African Revenue Service ("SARS"). The fourth and final issue explores the challenges facing tax jurisdictions as a result of an increase in electronic trade. The relevance of the arm's length principle is assessed and recommendations for South Africa are made...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Changes in the {{healthcare}} sector make hospitals more responsible for their investment decisions. There {{is a need to}} focus more on the investment decision making process and to determine the consequences of these investments. For this reason, this thesis discusses the ways in which a model is developed to assist the real estate decision making process regarding the investment opportunities at the UMCG. The goal of the thesis was to: Develop a model by which decisions, regarding investments in the real estate at the UMCG, can be made. From this goal, two central questions were derived. The first focuses on the method used in the model: What {{is the best way to}} analyse investment opportunities to serve as the foundation of the model and that fits with the UMCG and its surroundings? The second question focuses on the development and working of the model itself: In which way can a model be developed that assists the decision making process for real estate projects at the UMCG? Method Literature study, consultation of stakeholders and testing the model. The literature study focuses on the methods of investment decisions that exist within the academic community. Stakeholders were consulted to discuss the progress thus far, to list possible improvements and to obtain information. When the model was developed and applied to an old case, the future users of the model tested it to see if the model and the manual that supports the model were understandable and usable. Results The literature provided information for comparison of three different methods of analysing investment opportunities: the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Real Options Analysis (ROA) and Direct Capitalisation (DC). The DCF method was favoured, mainly because it is accurate and easily understandable. This last argument allows the model to be used by financial and non-financial persons. The Net Present Value (NPV) of all possible different alternatives was given as output and was compared to each other to determine the best alternative. This NPV lists the total present value of all the cash flows during the lifespan of a project. The Weighted Average cost of Capital (WACC) is the weighted average between the cost of debt and cost of equity and was used to determine the discount factor. Calculating this for the UMCG resulted in a WACC of 6, 07 %. The input consists out of the operational income and expenses, the initial investment <b>income</b> <b>or</b> <b>expenses</b> and the duration of the project. The output was given by the NPV and a sensitivity analysis to see what happens if the revenues rise of fall up to 5 %. An important feature of the model was its flexibility so it can be used for real estate investments for any project within the UMCG. The model was applied to a current case where the psychiatric department for adults (UCP) and children (UCKJP) need new housing. Please note that the absolute values of the NPVs contain a large degree of uncertainty, because the allocating of the Academisch Component en Rijksbijdrage (AC&R) and the overhead expenses may not be fully accurate. Any improvements that are done to make these input parameters more reliable would greatly improve the accuracy of the NPV. This lack of accuracy on the NPV was not a great problem since the main function of the model is to compare different alternatives and the uncertain input was the same for each alternative. This means that the ranking of the alternatives remains the same regardless of the height of the AC&R and overhead expenses. Another limitation was that the model can only list options that are available now, not ones that may come available in the future. This limits the number of alternatives that can be listed. Further improvements on this matter can be made by expanding the model to include option or decision trees that can list all possible options. Conclusion The best way to analyse investment opportunities to serve as the foundation of the model and that fits with the UMCG and its surroundings is to use the DCF method in which the NPV is used as output. The WACC is used to determine the discount factor. By listing the requirements of the model, the input and output parameters became clear. Applying the model to a case and testing it by the future users showed that the model works as it should. Further improvements to the model can be made by finding a better peer group when calculating the WACC, using option trees to add flexibility and improving the allocation of certain centralized budgets. ...|$|E
40|$|In The Two-Income Trap, Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren and {{business}} consultant Amelia Warren Tyagi reach a startling conclusion: a two-income middle-class family faces greater financial risks today than a one-income family faced three decades ago. Middle-class families {{are caught in}} an 2 ̆ 2 income trap 2 ̆ 2 because they budget based on two incomes and face financial ruin if they lose an <b>income</b> <b>or</b> incur unexpected <b>expenses.</b> The authors suggest that most middle-class families cannot quickly adjust their budgets because their largest monthly expense is the fixed mortgage payment. The parents maintained {{that they had to}} allocate a significant portion of their income to housing expenses to ensure they could buy a home in a good neighborhood with good, safe schools (pp. 22 - 23, 29, 32). Moreover, because good schools are located in expensive neighborhoods, parents contend that they must participate in a high priced bidding war for those homes. If their <b>income</b> declines <b>or</b> <b>expenses</b> increase, however, they are trapped: unable to pay the mortgage and unable to quickly reduce their living expenses (pp. 7 - 8). The book never explains how parents determine what is a 2 ̆ 2 good, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 safe 2 ̆ 2 neighborhood or school. Housing and school segregation patterns suggest, however, that some middle-class parents consciously or unconsciously use 2 ̆ 2 good and safe 2 ̆ 2 as a proxy for predominately or exclusively 2 ̆ 2 nonminority. 2 ̆ 2 This Review suggests that middle-income parents can no longer afford these racial housing preferences. The Review summarizes the problems middle-class families face then argues that what is viewed as 2 ̆ 2 good 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 safe 2 ̆ 2 may be based more on racially biased perceptions than on reality. The Review concludes by arguing {{that the best way to}} help middle-class families avoid the income trap is to make school assignments without regard to the student 2 ̆ 7 s street address and to allow parents who live in integrated neighborhoods to participate in an auction to buy a slot in their first choice school...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there is}} already a variety of papers {{analyzing}} tax evasion decisions, only little focus is put on tax evasion of gains and losses. As taxpayers can evade taxes by either underreporting their <b>income</b> <b>or</b> by overdeducting <b>expenses,</b> we study whether there is a significant difference if subject are confronted with a gain or a loss scenario. We find that individuals evade more in the first than in the latter case. As a consequence, subjects are more willing to evade taxes by underreporting income than by overdeducting expenses. We show that this finding can be explained by mental accounting and an asymmetric evaluation of tax payments and tax refunds. Our result is robust to treatment variation. However, if individuals have to complete only one tax declaration (but still decide on gains and losses) and we therefore expect subjects to use only one mental account, the effect vanishes.
