40|$|Many {{countries}} in the MENA region have established partial credit <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> to facilitate SME access to finance. These schemes {{can play an important}} role, especially in a period where MENA governments are making efforts to improve the effectiveness of credit registries and bureaus and strengthen creditor rights. This paper reviews the design of partial credit <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> in MENA, and assesses their preliminary outcomes. The paper is based on a survey conducted in 10 MENA {{countries in}} early 2010. The authors find that the average size of <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> in MENA (measured by the total value of outstanding guarantees) is in line with the international average, although there are wide differences across countries, and some schemes seem too small to make any significant impact. Most importantly, the number of guarantees looks generally small while their average value looks large. This suggests that <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> are not yet reaching the smaller firms. <b>Guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> in MENA look financially sound and most schemes have room to grow. However, this growth should be accompanied by an improvement of some key design and management features, as well as the introduction of systematic impact evaluation reviews.

40|$|What {{explains}} national {{positions to}} the recast directive on deposit <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes?</b> The financial crisis {{has demonstrated that}} integrated capital and financial markets need strong measures on systemic stability to stand confidence-induced break-downs. In view of raising cross-border banking deposit <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> as means to avoid panic withdrawals have come into sight. European states have therefore encouraged further harmonization on deposit insurance to first, enhance investor confidence for systemic stability and second, ensure fair competition on common markets for capital and banking services. Despite their commitment to align national <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> further states fail to ratify pan-European deposit insurance. A case study on Austrian, German and Irish positions examines chances for a common scheme.

25|$|Uncertainty {{began to}} {{dominate}} the global financial and economic environment. Business and consumer confidence in New Zealand plummeted as dozens of finance companies collapsed. To try and stop a flight of funds from New Zealand institutions to those in Australia, the Government established the Crown Retail Deposit <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Scheme</b> to cover depositors funds {{in the event that}} a bank or finance company went broke. This protected some investors but nevertheless, at least 67 finance companies collapsed within a short period of time. The largest of these was South Canterbury Finance which cost taxpayers NZ$1.58 billion when the company collapsed in August 2010. The directors of many of these finance companies were subsequently investigated for fraud and some high-profile directors went to prison.|$|E

2500|$|After 2008 global {{financial}} crisis {{which led to}} the steep rise in unemployment especially among the banking and finance industries, Tsang announced on 8 December 2008 to create 60,000 jobs in 2009 by speeding up infrastructure projects and a ten-fold increase in its loan <b>guarantee</b> <b>scheme</b> for small and medium sized enterprises. The Tsang government also quickly formed a Task Force on Economic Challenges to deal with the crisis. Tsang came up with six economic sectors to explore with the recommendations of the Task Force in his 2009–10 policy address: (1) testing and certification, (2) medical services, (3) innovation and technology, (4) cultural and creative industries, (5) environmental industry, and (6) educational services. The government pledged to provide more concrete support in those sectors and called them as the [...] "new economic pillars".

5000|$|Agreeing on {{a common}} European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS): A new common deposit {{insurance}} would be less vulnerable than the current national deposit <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes,</b> towards eruption of local shocks (in particular when both the sovereign and its national banking sector is perceived by the market {{to be in a}} fragile situation). It would also carry less risk for needing injection of additional public money to service its payment of deposit guarantees in the event of severe crisis, as failing risks would be spread more widely across all member states while its private sector funds would be raised over a much larger pool of financial institutions. EDIS would just like the national deposit <b>guarantee</b> <b>schemes</b> be privately funded through ex ante risk-based fees paid by all the participating banks in the Member States, and be devised {{in a way that would}} prevent moral hazard. Establishment of a fully-fledged EDIS will take time.

This paper, attempts to explore the Islamic <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Schemes</b> services as provided by the Credit Guarant ee Corporation (CGC).

Results of the survey postulated that many of the entrepreneurs were not aware of the existence of Islamic <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Schemes,</b> and their knowledge pertaining to the Shari 'ah principles of Islamic microfinancing is rather shallow. The results have important implications to the policy makers in strengthening the use of Islamic microfinancing among SMEs.
