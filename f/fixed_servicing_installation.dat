50|$|The Fire Safety Command {{assists and}} advises {{the public on}} fire {{protection}} measures {{with the aim of}} enhancing their fire safety awareness. The Community Relations Division is responsible for promoting fire safety and co-ordinating with other government departments and District Fire Safety Committees in stepping up fire prevention publicity. To promote fire safety awareness at district levels, the Division works closely with local fire stations in organising fire safety talks, seminars, exhibitions, fire drills and training of Fire Safety Ambassadors, who are volunteers from various sectors of the community to raise awareness of fire safety. The Commercial Buildings and Premises Division enforces the Fire Safety (Commercial Premises) Ordinance for upgrading fire safety measures in prescribed commercial premises (i.e. supermarkets, department stores, shopping arcades, banks, jewelry or goldsmith premises and off-course betting centres) and specified commercial buildings (i.e. commercial buildings constructed or the plans of building works of which first submitted to the Building Authority for approval on or before March 1, 1987). A Building Safety Loan Scheme has also been established to provide financial assistance to owners of such premises and buildings to upgrade the fire safety measures where necessary. Pending implementation of the Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance, the Building Improvement and Support Division continues to inspect old private composite and domestic buildings with a view to enhancing fire safety and advising owners and occupiers concerned on the improved standards to be required. The Fire <b>Service</b> <b>Installation</b> Task Force inspects fire <b>service</b> <b>installations</b> in buildings, handles complaints regarding building fire <b>service</b> <b>installations</b> and monitors the performance of registered fire <b>service</b> <b>installation</b> contractors. The Railway Development Strategy Division scrutinises fire safety strategies and processes building plans of new railway infrastructure projects. It also carries out acceptance tests of fire <b>service</b> <b>installations</b> on completion of those projects. The Theme Park Projects Division formulates fire safety requirements for buildings and other supporting infrastructures in the Hong Kong Disneyland theme park in Penny's Bay. It also carries out acceptance tests on fire <b>service</b> <b>installations</b> upon completion of these works.|$|R

Changing the use of a serviced usable space often necessitates alteration of supporting <b>services</b> <b>installations.</b> The functional, rather than physical, obsolescence of building services components will become more common as the rate of space use change increases.

40|$|Our main {{result is}} a primal-dual 6 -approximation {{algorithm}} {{under the assumption that}} there is an ordering on the facilities such that if i comes before i 0 in this ordering then for every service type l, fli < = fli 0. This includes (as special cases) the settings where the <b>service</b> <b>installation</b> cost fli depends only on the service type l, or depends only on the location i. With arbitrary <b>service</b> <b>installation</b> costs, the problem becomes as hard as the set-cover problem. Our algorithm extends the algorithm of Jain & Vazirani [9] in a novel way. If the <b>service</b> <b>installation</b> cost depends only on the service type and not on the location, we give an LP rounding algorithm that attains an improved approximation ratio of 2. 391. The algorithm combines both clustered randomized rounding [6] and the filtering based technique of [10, 14]. We also consider the k-median version of the problem where there is an additional requirement that at most k facilities may be opened. We use our primal-dual algorithm to give a constant-factor approximation for this problem when the <b>service</b> <b>installation</b> cost depends only on the service type. 1 Introduction Facility location problems have been widely studied inthe Operations Research community (see for e. g. [12]). In its simplest version, uncapacitated facility location(UFL), we are given a set of facilities, F, and a set of demands or clients D. Each facility i has a facilityopening cos...|$|R

The definitive version is available at: [URL] organisations are responding to the diminishing stability of their operating environments by developing flexible methods of performing their core function. This creates demand for flexible supporting building space. While the architectural problems of providing such space have been solved for many years, its servicing remains problematic. This difficulty is manifested in the rising cost of services alterations necessitated when spaces are changed in use. The current inflexibility of <b>services</b> <b>installation</b> construction has prompted a study of reusable building services components. It is anticipated that this approach will increase <b>services</b> <b>installation</b> adaptability by reducing alteration costs. Focusing on the UK National Health Service, this paper presents a survey of trends in organisational function, their estate implications {{and the extent to which}} facilities managers can control or plan estate responses to frequent core function revision. Existing services component reuse practices are reviewed and component and process attributes conducive to disassembly and refurbishment are identified. It is concluded that, while reusable services components will achieve the required <b>services</b> <b>installation</b> adaptability, their technical feasibility and economic viability remain to be determined...|$|R

40|$|Delay is {{a common}} problem in the {{construction}} industry and there are several reasons that can contribute to delaying a project. In Hong Kong, completion of fire <b>services</b> <b>installation</b> is prerequisite to completing/ finishing a building construction work. The fire <b>services</b> <b>installation</b> must be completed for application of an occupation permit for a building. Fail to obtain the permit on time would lead to construction delay. Apparently, fire services contractors {{play an important role in}} obtaining the occupation permit for a project completion. The economic losses due to construction delay could be very significant. This research identified, from a list of 49 pre-determined factors in nine categories (shown in Appendix A), the principal factors contributed to construction delays in a fire <b>services</b> <b>installation.</b> In particular, a questionnaire survey of 52 fire services contractors and 32 consulting engineers was conducted in order to obtain their professional judgements about the relative importance of the contributors of construction delay related to the fire <b>services</b> <b>installation.</b> The result showed that the principal contributors were: (1) improper site co-ordination and management of the electrical and mechanical installations, (2) lack of timely decision making of the client, and (3) defects identified during the fire services inspection by local authorities. In addition differing views were found between the consulting engineers and contractors on the areas identified were: (1) site management and supervision, (2) workload of the project staff, (3) the procedures for equipment approval, and (4) working experience of the parties. A monitoring and quality assurance system would be required in these areas to minimize the risk of the probable construction delay. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
