5|$|Biographies of Kerr {{have been}} {{published}} by Eric Braun and, in 2010, by the entertainment journalist Michelangelo Capua, but she has yet to receive an <b>in-depth</b> study of her filmography, artistry or life.|$|E
5|$|On December 6, 2002, Toriyama {{made his}} only promotional {{appearance}} in the United States at the launch of Weekly Shōnen Jumps North American counterpart, Shonen Jump, in New York City. Toriyama's Dragon Ball and Sand Land {{were published in the}} magazine in the first issue, which also included an <b>in-depth</b> interview with him.|$|E
5|$|Peart's {{instructional}} DVD Anatomy of a Drum Solo is an <b>in-depth</b> {{examination of}} how he constructs a solo that is musical rather than indulgent, using his solo from the 2004 R30 30th anniversary tour as an example.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of NygmaTech was after Batman solves the third riddle and was more <b>in-depth.</b> There were scenes shot {{that appear in}} publicity stills of Edward Nygma with a hard hat helping with the {{construction of}} his headquarters on Claw Island.|$|E
5|$|Through the Steam {{platform}} for the Windows version, the games can collect and report <b>in-depth</b> data such as where the player's character died, completion time, and total victories in multiplayer modes. This data is compiled to generate gameplay statistics for Episode One, Episode Two, and Team Fortress 2.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} these circles {{were built in the}} area around modern Dorset, {{typically}} being constructed from sarsen stone and being smaller than those found elsewhere. The Kingston Russell ring is the largest of those in Dorset, measuring 24 by 27 metres (79 feet by 89 feet) in diameter and containing eighteen sarsen stones arranged in an oval shape. The site has not been excavated or been subject to <b>in-depth</b> archaeological investigation.|$|E
5|$|BioWare's Baldur's Gate {{series was}} no less important, the most {{significant}} D series to be released since the Gold Box era. The games created the most accurate and <b>in-depth</b> D simulation yet, and featured support for up to six-players in cooperative mode. Baldur's Gate (1998) provided an epic story with NPC followers and written dialogue that continued through both titles and two expansion packs. Black Isle produced a more combat-oriented series, Icewind Dale, soon thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Haley coauthored The Autobiography of MalcolmX, {{and also}} {{performed}} the basic functions of a ghostwriter and biographical amanuensis, writing, compiling, and editing the Autobiography based {{on more than}} 50 <b>in-depth</b> interviews he conducted with MalcolmX between 1963 and his subject's 1965 assassination. The two first met in 1959, when Haley wrote {{an article about the}} Nation of Islam for Reader's Digest, and again when Haley interviewed MalcolmX for Playboy in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, first {{published}} in 1781 and presented again with major revisions in 1787, represents a significant intervention into what will later {{become known as the}} philosophy of mind. Kant's first critique is generally recognized as among the most significant works of modern philosophy in the West. Kant is a figure whose influence is marked in both continental and analytic/Anglo-American philosophy. Kant's work develops an <b>in-depth</b> study of transcendental consciousness, or {{the life of the mind}} as conceived through universal categories of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Knut's full autopsy {{results were}} {{published}} by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in the Journal of Comparative Pathology. It was the most <b>in-depth</b> post-mortem ever carried out on an animal. The autopsy revealed that {{the damage to the}} bear’s brain was so severe that even if he had not fallen into the water and drowned he would have died anyway. Experts hypothesized that he was suffering from a virus that caused the encephalitis.|$|E
5|$|In March 1999, {{one month}} after the game's release, Final Fantasy VIII Ultimania was published, a book that {{features}} an <b>in-depth</b> guide to Final Fantasy VIII and interviews with the developers. An origami book was released in November 1999. On September 22, 1999, a CD-ROM titled Final Fantasy VIII Desktop Accessories was released. It contains desktop icons, computer wallpapers, screensavers, and an e-mail application. It additionally features a stand-alone edition of the Triple Triad minigame, which allowed players to compete against one another via a local area network.|$|E
5|$|Local Conservative Associations {{began to}} educate {{citizens}} about the Party's platform and {{encouraged them to}} register to vote annually, as mandated by the Act. Press coverage of national politics in the local press was joined by <b>in-depth</b> reports on provincial politics in the national press. Grassroots Conservatives therefore saw themselves {{as part of a}} national political movement during the 1830s.|$|E
5|$|Many critics {{compared}} Nuka-World to {{a previous}} expansion pack for Fallout 4 named Far Harbor. Dan Stapleton (IGN) {{said that when}} compared to Far Harbor, the role-playing elements are far less developed, though he also said Nuka-World has a nice setting filled with surprises and battles. Nicholas Tan (Game Revolution) also believed {{it was one of}} the better expansion packs, albeit not having such an <b>in-depth</b> a story-line as Far Harbor. Paul Tassi (Forbes) preferred Far Harbor due to this expansion being light on story.|$|E
5|$|Mercury readily {{combines}} with aluminium {{to form a}} mercury-aluminium amalgam {{when the}} two pure metals come into contact. Since the amalgam destroys the aluminium oxide layer which protects metallic aluminium from oxidizing <b>in-depth</b> (as in iron rusting), even small amounts of mercury can seriously corrode aluminium. For this reason, mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances {{because of the risk}} of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Mobile device {{forensics}} is a sub-branch {{of digital}} forensics relating to recovery of digital evidence or {{data from a}} mobile device. It differs from Computer forensics in that a mobile device will have an inbuilt communication system (e.g. GSM) and, usually, proprietary storage mechanisms. Investigations usually focus on simple data such as call data and communications (SMS/Email) rather than <b>in-depth</b> recovery of deleted data. SMS data from a mobile device investigation helped to exonerate Patrick Lumumba {{in the murder of}} Meredith Kercher.|$|E
5|$|More <b>in-depth</b> {{investigations}} {{were conducted}} by Esther Levenson, Pessia Tsamir, and Dina Tirosh, who interviewed a pair of sixth-grade students who were performing highly in their mathematics class. One student preferred deductive explanations of mathematical claims, while the other preferred practical examples. Both students initially thought that 0 was neither even nor odd, for different reasons. Levenson et al. demonstrated how the students' reasoning reflected their concepts of zero and division.|$|E
5|$|Murray's {{work was}} {{increasingly}} criticised following {{her death in}} 1963, with the definitive academic rejection of the Murrayite witch-cult theory occurring during the 1970s. During these decades, a variety of scholars across Europe and North America– such as Alan Macfarlane, Erik Midelfort, William Monter, Robert Muchembled, Gerhard Schormann, Bente Alver and Bengt Ankarloo– published <b>in-depth</b> studies of the archival records from the witch trials, leaving no doubt that those tried for witchcraft were not practitioners of a surviving pre-Christian religion.|$|E
5|$|NASA's ongoing {{investigations}} include <b>in-depth</b> surveys of Mars (Mars 2020 and InSight) and Saturn and {{studies of the}} Earth and the Sun. Other active spacecraft missions are Juno for Jupiter, New Horizons (for Jupiter, Pluto, and beyond), and Dawn for the asteroid belt. NASA continued to support in situ exploration beyond the asteroid belt, including Pioneer and Voyager traverses into the unexplored trans-Pluto region, and Gas Giant orbiters Galileo (1989–2003), Cassini(1997–2017), and Juno (2011–).|$|E
5|$|On August 16, 2011, Universal Pictures {{released}} The Big Lebowski on Blu-ray. The limited-edition {{package includes}} a Jeff Bridges photo book, a ten-years-on retrospective, and an <b>in-depth</b> {{look at the}} annual Lebowski Fest. The film is also available in the Blu-ray Coen Brothers box set released in the UK, however this version is region free and will work in any Blu-ray player.|$|E
5|$|Once filming on {{the movie}} was completed, Berg began to explore {{adapting}} the story for television. Berg later said he had regretted having to jettison many of the interpersonal topics from the book {{because of the time}} constraints of a feature film. Creating a TV series, particularly one based on fictional characters, allowed him to address many of those elements <b>in-depth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Spencer W. Kimball {{suggested}} that Arrington write a serious biography of Brigham Young, and Arrington paid assistants {{for the project}} {{out of his own}} pocket, possibly to insulate it from donor influences. Arrington wrote the <b>in-depth</b> biography with help from many of his associates at the History Division. One of Arrington's biographers, Gary Topping, praised the research in Brigham Young: American Moses, but criticized its lack of psychological depth, missing the opportunity to re-examine the Mountain Meadows massacre and how Young's wives were treated.|$|E
5|$|The Autobiography of Malcolm X was {{published}} in 1965, {{the result of a}} collaboration between human rights activist MalcolmX and journalist Alex Haley. Haley coauthored the autobiography based on a series of <b>in-depth</b> interviews he conducted between 1963 and MalcolmX's 1965 assassination. The Autobiography is a spiritual conversion narrative that outlines MalcolmX's philosophy of black pride, black nationalism, and pan-Africanism. After the leader was killed, Haley wrote the book's epilogue. He described their collaborative process and the events at the end of MalcolmX's life.|$|E
5|$|The CIA's California campus {{also runs}} an {{accelerated}} culinary program {{for students who}} already have at least four {{years of experience in}} foodservice. The program includes the same basic classes as the school's associate degree programs, however the accelerated program does not include the externship requirement, and several classes are run with a faster-paced curriculum or including more <b>in-depth</b> material.|$|E
5|$|The DVD for The Blair Witch Project was {{released}} on October 26, 1999 by Artisan, presented in a 1.33:1 windowboxed aspect ratio and Dolby Digital 2.0 audio. Special features include the documentary Curse of the Blair Witch, a five-minute Newly Discovered Footage, audio commentary, production notes, and cast and crew biographies. The audio commentary presents directors Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sánchez, and producers Rob Cowie, Mike Monello and Gregg Hale, in which they discuss the film's production. The Curse of the Blair Witch feature provides an <b>in-depth</b> look inside {{the creation of the}} film.|$|E
5|$|The Jakarta Post Sunday edition was {{launched}} on 18 September 1994. The Sunday edition included more <b>in-depth</b> stories, {{as well as}} entertainment and fiction {{that would not be}} published in the weekday editions. As part of cost-cutting measures amid declining print advertising revenue, the Sunday edition ceased publication in April 2016. It was replaced by a lifestyle and culture magazine called J+, which is included with the newspaper's Saturday edition.|$|E
5|$|The {{articles}} described Cheney's {{influence on}} decisions pertaining to detention of suspected terrorists {{and the legal}} limits that apply to their questioning, especially what constitutes torture. U.S. Army Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, who served as Colin Powell's chief of staff when he was both Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{at the same time}} Cheney was Secretary of Defense, and then later when Powell was Secretary of State, stated in an <b>in-depth</b> interview that Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld established an alternative program to interrogate post-9/11 detainees because of their mutual distrust of CIA.|$|E
5|$|The book {{presents}} an <b>in-depth</b> analysis and refutation {{of climate change}} denial, going over several arguments point-by-point and disproving them with peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus for climate change. The authors assert that those denying climate change engage in tactics including cherry picking data purported to support their specific viewpoints, and attacking the integrity of climate scientists. They use social science theory to examine the phenomenon of climate change denial in the wider public, and call this phenomenon a form of pathology.|$|E
5|$|The <b>in-depth</b> {{studies of}} the juridic {{classical}} works in Beirut, and later in Constantinople, conferred an unprecedented scientific dimension to jurisprudence; this academic movement {{gave rise to the}} minds behind Justinian's juridic reforms. As a result of the new understanding of the classical juridic texts, the imperial laws of the late 5th and early 6th centuries were clearer and more coherent than those of the early Postclassical Era, according to legal historian George Mousourakis and other scholars.|$|E
5|$|The {{local radio}} {{stations}} Rádio Mar (89.0) and Radio Onda Viva (96.1) broadcast on FM and online. The stations' programming include local news and sports and feature an <b>in-depth</b> {{look at the}} city's top news by interviewing a guest at lunchtime on weekends. Radio Onda Viva airs Mandarin Chinese programming daily. The radio station, Rádio Mar, and the newspaper Póvoa Semanário {{belong to the same}} group; the same company offers news services to the neighbouring cities of Vila do Conde and Esposende.|$|E
5|$|The two {{additional}} episodes, Turnabout Reclaimed and Quiz Turnabout Deduction, were made available as downloadable content {{shortly after the}} game's Japanese release. Turnabout Reclaimed was released in the West on November 21, 2013, but Quiz Turnabout Deduction remained exclusive to Japan due to its dependency on <b>in-depth</b> knowledge of Japanese culture. Downloadable costumes for Phoenix, Athena and Apollo were made available for download upon the game's release. These costumes were available for free until August 15, 2013 in Japan, and until November 7, 2013 for the English versions, after which they were available for purchase.|$|E
