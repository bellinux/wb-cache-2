40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{increase}} the density of <b>guided</b> <b>rockets,</b> a passive control method was proposed to reduce the trajectory dispersion caused by initial disturbances, thrust misalignment, vertical wind, etc. {{at the end of}} boost phase. The basic principle of passive control method was introduced briefly, and then the disturbance motion equations for the rocket projectile were established. The effective conditions to implement passive control on <b>guided</b> <b>rockets</b> were put forward. A technical scheme of installing elastic sabots on rocket projectile was proposed to realize passive control and a simulation was conducted. The simulation results indicate that the passive control scheme can effectively decrease the velocity direction deviation caused by various disturbances factors at the end of boost phase...|$|R

The North American division of MBDA {{is the only}} manufacturer of the Laser <b>Guided</b> Zuni <b>Rocket</b> [...] similar to the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System upgrade to the Hydra 70 system. The Laser <b>Guided</b> Zuni <b>Rocket</b> is composed of the new WGU-58/B Guidance and Control Section that {{is attached to the}} front end of an unguided Zuni rocket and warhead. The weapon requires semi-active laser energy to guide to a precise target.

The precision weapon fits in the same launcher as unguided Zunis and requires only a 28V firing pulse and a semi active laser designator.

They carried a conventional high explosive warhead with a design based on the Munroe effect. Smaller calibers were mounted for launch in series on platforms similar to the Russian Katyusha rocket launcher (Stalin`s organ) and used by the Biafrans in place of artillery.|$|E
