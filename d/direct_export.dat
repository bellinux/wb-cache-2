40|$|As {{domestic}} exports usually require imported inputs, {{the value}} of exports differs from the domestic value added contained in exports. The higher the domestic value added contained in exports, the higher the domestic national income created by exports will be. In this case, exports will expand the domestic market. Therefore, exports will push economic growth in two ways: through their direct effect on aggregate demand, and through their effect on the domestic market. For these reasons, the estimate {{of the magnitude of}} the domestic value added contained in exports helps explain the capacity of exports to lead economic growth. Domestic exports may be classified as <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>exports.</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>exports</b> are the goods sold to other countries; indirect exports are the domestically produced inputs incorporated in <b>direct</b> <b>exports.</b> The distinction between <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>exports</b> leads to a distinction between direct and indirect domestic value added contained in exports. The income of the factors directly involved in the production of <b>exports</b> constitutes <b>direct</b> domestic value added; the income contained in domestically produced inputs incorporated into exports constitutes the indirect domestic value added. Therefore, the magnitude of indirect value added depends on the density of the domestic intersectorial linkages. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present an estimation of the domestic indirect value added contained in Mexico's manufacturing exports in two ways. The first derives from the fact that a <b>direct</b> <b>exporting</b> sector may be the vehicle through which other sectors export in an indirect way; this leads us to estimate the indirect value added contained in exports by sector of origin. The second refers to the destination of this indirect value added - that is, to the <b>direct</b> <b>exporting</b> sectors in which the value added contained in indirect exports of each sector appears. Based on the input-output table for Mexico (National Institute of Statistics and Geography-INEGI 2008), we estimate the domestic value added contained in inputs used to produce Mexican manufacturing exports. We show separately the domestic value added from maquiladora exports and from exports produced by the rest of the manufacturing sector. In order to distinguish the indirect value added in exports by sector of origin and destination of the intermediate inputs, we work with square matrices of indirect domestic value-added multipliers...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} governmental policies in influencing the path of internationalization of {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). It focuses on the role of institutions mandated to assist internationalization, as exemplified by Canada's Export Development Corporation (EDC). We illustrate and examine critically the role that governments typically play in assisting and influencing the international expansion of domestic firms. We argue that the activities of agencies such as EDC — mainly in financing and in insuring against the risks inherent in export activities — may actually be counterproductive to the long-term interests of many SMEs by skewing managers' decisions toward <b>direct</b> <b>exporting,</b> rather than toward indirect exporting by entering the value chain of already-established multinational enterprises (MNEs). A consequence may be to divert the constrained resources of entrepreneurial firms away from their greatest comparative advantage — innovation — toward managing direct entry into international markets in which they are at a comparative disadvantage relative to larger established MNEs. Highly innovative SMEs might be better off by leaving the internationalization of their innovations to MNEs and sharing some of the international <b>direct</b> <b>exporting</b> profits with them instead. The implications are relevant for governmental policies toward internationalizing SMEs not just in Canada but in open, market-oriented economies everywhere...|$|R
