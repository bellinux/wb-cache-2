On the other hand, where an administrative decision interferes with an individual's liberty, the matter will be considered within the precedent fact category unless Parliament has explicitly excluded judicial review.

Although Chao eventually die, if they received enough affection during their lives they reincarnate.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{rendered}} its {{judgment on}} 9 January 1998. It accepted the appellant's assertion that Article 73(a) was an <b>empowering</b> provision. Hence since section 6(3) of the RSIA had clearly and unambiguously excluded Article 73(a) of the Malaysian Constitution from applying in Singapore following {{its independence from}} Malaysia, Parliament had disempowered itself from legislating extraterritorially. Applying this to the case, the Court held that Parliament had no legislative power to enact section 37(1) of the PCA.|$|E

5|$|Amongst {{non-governmental}} organizations (NGOs) working to end child marriage are Girls not Brides, Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) and Human Rights Watch (HRW). Although not explicitly {{included in the}} original Millennium Development Goals, considerable pressure was applied to include ending child marriage in the successor Sustainable Development Goals adopted in September 2015, where ending this practice by 2030 is a target of SDG 5 Gender Equality (see above). While some {{progress is being made}} in reducing child marriage, particularly for girls under fifteen, the prospects are daunting. The indicator for this will be the percentage of women aged 20–24 who were married or in a union before the age of eighteen. Efforts to end child marriage include legislation and ensuring enforcement together with <b>empowering</b> women and girls. To raise awareness, the inaugural UN International Day of the Girl Child in 2012 was dedicated to ending child marriage.|$|E
5|$|Communities such as AVEN can be {{beneficial}} to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity {{with regard to their}} possible asexuality. Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community. They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to questioning whether the way they feel is acceptable, and possible reasons for why they feel this way. Pathological beliefs tend to follow, in which, in some cases, they may seek medical help because they feel they have a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find a definition that matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on a communal level, which can be <b>empowering,</b> because they now have something to associate with, which gives normality to this overall socially-isolating situation.|$|E

5|$|In a {{proposal}} to the 11th plenum of the 9th Central Committee, Võ Văn Kiệt suggested democratizing the political system by giving the delegates to a party congress the power to elect the general secretary, the Central Committee and the Central Commission for Inspection, and giving congress delegates ultimate power on all matters put before them at the congress. He called for {{the reduction of the}} Central Committee from one-fourth to one-third, holding the elections of state leaders at the National Assembly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} a congress (and not a year later), secret ballots for elections, <b>empowering</b> delegates to self-nominate to the Central Committee and merging the offices of President and General Secretary into one.

5|$|Internationally, many United Nations {{agencies}} such as the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and UNICEF maintain specific programs on women's health, or maternal, sexual and reproductive health.
