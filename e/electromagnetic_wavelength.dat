40|$|The {{electronic}} structure and optical properties of freestanding GaN wurtzite quantum wires are {{studied in the}} framework of six-band effective-mass envelope function theory. It is found that the electron states are either twofold or fourfold degenerate. There is a dark exciton effect when the radius R of GaN wurtzite quantum wires is in the range of [0. 7, 10. 9] nm. The linear polarization factors are calculated in three cases, the quantum confinement effect (finite long wire), the dielectric effect and both effects (infinitely long wire). It is found that the linear polarization factor of a finite long wire whose length is much less than the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wavelength</b> decreases as R increases, is very close to unity (0. 979) at R = I nm, and changes from a positive value to a negative value around R = 4. 1 nm. The linear polarization factor of the dielectric effect is 0. 934, independent of radius, as long as the radius remains much less than the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wavelength.</b> The result for the two effects shows that the quantum confinement effect gives a correction to the dielectric effect result. It is found that the linear polarization factor of very long (treated approximately as infinitely long) quantum wires is in the range of [0. 8, 1].
