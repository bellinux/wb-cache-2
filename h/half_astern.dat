500|$|Early in the evening, Voyager had no {{difficulties}} maintaining {{her position}} during the manoeuvres both ships performed. Following {{a series of}} turns intended to reverse the courses of both ships beginning at 8:40pm, Voyager ended up to starboard of Melbourne. At 8:52pm, Voyager was ordered to resume the plane guard station. The procedure to accomplish this required Voyager {{to turn away from}} Melbourne in a large circle, cross behind the carrier, then take position off Melbournes port side. Instead, Voyager first turned to starboard, away from Melbourne, then turned to port without warning. It was initially assumed by Melbournes bridge crew that Voyager was conducting a series of tight turns to lose speed before swinging behind Melbourne, but Voyager did not alter course again. At 8:55pm, with Voyager approaching, Melbournes navigator ordered the carrier's engines to <b>half</b> <b>astern</b> speed, with Robertson ordering an increase to full astern a few seconds later. At the same time, Stevens, having just become aware of the situation, gave the order [...] "Full ahead both engines. Hard-a starboard.", before instructing the destroyer's Quartermaster to announce that a collision was imminent. Both ships' measures were too late to avoid a collision; Melbourne hit Voyager at 8:56pm.|$|E
2500|$|At 8:55pm, with Voyager still {{turning to}} port, Melbournes {{navigator}} ordered the carrier's engines to <b>half</b> <b>astern</b> speed, with Robertson ordering an increase to full astern {{a few seconds}} later. At the same time, Stevens, returning to Voyagers bridge from the nearby chart table, gave the order [...] "Full ahead both engines. Hard a-starboard.", before instructing the destroyer's Quartermaster to announce that a collision was imminent. Both ships' measures were too late to avoid a collision; Melbourne hit Voyager at 8:56pm.|$|E
60|$|Ere {{long the}} Swan was almost abreast her late pursuers, who were {{about a mile}} and a quarter to seaward; while the other three Spanish ships, with all sails set, were {{a mile and a}} <b>half</b> <b>astern,</b> but a good deal nearer in shore.|$|E
6000|$|... "His line is lubberly, after all, Greenly! Look {{at those}} two ships astern--they are near {{half a mile}} to {{windward}} {{of the rest of}} the fleet, and at least <b>half</b> a mile <b>astern.</b> Hey! Greenly?" ...|$|R
60|$|Came {{the roar}} of a second gun, and a round shot splashed the water less than <b>half</b> a cable's-length <b>astern.</b> Blood leaned over the rail {{to speak to the}} fair young man {{immediately}} below him by the helmsman at the whipstaff.|$|R
5000|$|On 15 May 1943, the Cuban {{merchant}} ship Camagüey, and the Honduran Hanks, both loaded with sugar, sailed from Sagua La Grande, bound for Havana, escorted by the Cuban submarine chasers CS-11, CS-12, and CS-13. At 17:15 hours, a U.S. Navy Kingfisher aircraft from squadron VS-62 operating from Cuba spotted U-176 at [...] and dropped a smoke float to mark her position about {{one and a}} <b>half</b> miles <b>astern</b> of the convoy. CS-13 located the U-boat with her sonar, attacked with depth charges and sank U-176.|$|R

60|$|With those prongs of hair {{sticking}} {{up all over}} his head, and his breath coming and going very hard and short, the busy Pancks fell back a step (in Tug metaphor, took <b>half</b> a turn <b>astern)</b> as if to show his dingy hull complete, then forged a-head again, and directed his quick glance by turns into his hat where his note-book was, and into Clennam's face.|$|R
60|$|The {{start the}} {{schooner}} had made had at first widened {{the distance between}} them, and there was now {{a mile and a}} quarter of water separating them. The brigantine was hulled several times and her sails pierced, but her spars were still intact. She was permitted to gain until she was little more than <b>half</b> a mile <b>astern,</b> but the schooner had weathered on her, and was now nearly half a mile to windward.|$|R
2500|$|On Voyagers bridge, {{the officer}} of the watch and the {{navigator}} had become distracted, and Stevens was reading navigational charts, impairing his night vision. The port bridge lookout had come on duty while Voyager was turning to starboard, and raised the alarm when the swing back to port brought Melbourne back into view around 20:55. Melbournes navigation officer ordered the carrier's engines to <b>half</b> speed <b>astern</b> around the same time, which Captain Robertson increased to full astern a few seconds later. At the same time, Stevens gave the order [...] "Full ahead both engines. Hard a-starboard," [...] before instructing the destroyer's quartermaster to announce that a collision was imminent. Both ships' measures were too late; at 54 seconds from impact, the ships were less than [...] apart and in extremis –physically unable to alter their speed or course enough to avoid a collision.|$|R
60|$|Shortly after dawn, the {{two boys}} were called and came sleepily on deck. The day had broken cold and gray, while the wind had {{attained}} half a gale. Joe noted with astonishment the white tents of the quarantine station on Angel Island. San Francisco lay a smoky blur on the southern horizon, while the night, still lingering on {{the western edge of}} the world, slowly withdrew before their eyes. French Pete was just finishing a long reach into the Raccoon Straits, and at the same time studiously regarding a plunging sloop-yacht <b>half</b> a mile <b>astern.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{wish the}} other two Frenchmen were a little slower,” the captain said to the first lieutenant. “They are only a little farther behind her than when we started, and are, I think, only about <b>half</b> a mile <b>astern</b> of her. If she {{continues}} to travel at her present rate she will be close up to us by sunset. She is just about our own size, and I make no doubt that we should give a good account of her, but we could not hope to do so before her two consorts came up, and we could not expect to beat all three. If we could but fall in with one of our cruisers I would fight them willingly.” ...|$|R
60|$|About {{nine o'clock}} the next morning, Repeller No. 1, with her consort <b>half</b> a mile <b>astern,</b> and preceded {{by the two}} crabs, one on either bow, {{approached}} to within two miles of the harbour mouth. The crabs, {{a quarter of a}} mile ahead of the repeller, moved slowly; for between them they bore an immense net, three or four hundred feet long, and thirty feet deep, composed of jointed steel rods. Along the upper edge of this net was a series of air-floats, which were so graduated that they were sunk by the weight of the net a few feet below the surface of the water, from which position they held the net suspended vertically.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} we had got the Dawn just where we wished her to be, the combatants were drawing quite near to each other. The Speedy had carried sail so long, as {{to be a little}} to {{windward}} of her consort's wake, though <b>half</b> a cable's-length <b>astern</b> of her. The French were in still closer order, and they would soon be far enough advanced to bring the leading ship on each side, under fire. I supposed the opposing vessels would pass about a cable's-length apart. All four were under their top-sails, jibs, and spankers, with the courses in the brails. The Black Prince and the Speedy had their top-gallant-sails clewed up, while la Désirée and le Cerf had theirs still sheeted home, with the yards on the caps. All four vessels had sent down royal-yards. This was fighting sail, and everything indicated that Monsieur Menneval intended to make a day of it.|$|R
60|$|In {{running a}} mile and a half over the reef, in the manner described, Mulford had left the boat of Spike quite <b>half</b> a mile <b>astern.</b> He was now out of gun-shot from the brig, or at least beyond the range of her grape, the only missile he feared, and so far to {{windward}} that he kept his eye on every opening to the southward, which he fancied might allow of his making a stretch deeper into the mazes of the reef, among which he believed it easiest for him to escape, and to weary the oarsmen of his pursuers. Two or three of these openings offered as he glided along, but it struck him that they all looked so high that the boat would not lay through them--an opinion in which he was right. At length he came abreast of one that seemed straight and clear of obstacles as far as he could see, and through which he might run with a flowing sheet. Down went his helm, and about went his boat, running away to the southward as fast as ever.|$|R
60|$|I {{thought we}} were lost, again, but Providence once more saved us. All this time the leading English frigate and the two Frenchmen were fast {{approaching}} each other. In a few minutes, they must engage, while the Speedy was left further and further astern of her consort. At this critical instant, one of the Frenchmen fired a gun of defiance. That report seemed to arouse the Speedy as from a trance. Her head-yards came furiously round, all the officers vanished from her taffrail, and down went both fore and main-tacks, and to the mast-head rose all three of her top-gallant-sails. Thus additionally impelled, the lively craft dashed ahead, and was soon in her allotted berth, or <b>half</b> a cable's-length <b>astern</b> of the Black Prince, as I afterwards heard {{was the name of}} the commanding English ship, on this occasion. I may as well add here, that the French Commodore's ship was named La Désirée, and her consort Le Cerf. Mons. Menneval was senior officer of the French, and Sir Hotham Ward of the English. I never knew the name of the other French captain; or, if I did, I have forgotten it.|$|R
60|$|The quarter-masters of {{the fleet}} were just {{striking}} six bells, or proclaiming that it was seven {{o'clock in the morning}} watch, as the Plantagenet and le Téméraire came abeam of each other. Both ships lurched heavily in the troughs of the seas, and both rolled to windward in stately majesty, and yet both slid through the brine with a momentum that resembled the imperceptible motion of a planet. The water rolled back from their black sides and shining hammock-cloths, and all the other dark panoply that distinguishes a ship-of-war glistened with the spray; but no sign of hostility proceeded from either. The French admiral made no signal to engage, and Sir Gervaise had reasons of his own for wishing to pass the enemy's van, if possible, unnoticed. Minute passed after minute, in breathless silence, on board the Plantagenet and the Carnatic, the latter vessel being now but <b>half</b> a cable's-length <b>astern</b> of the admiral. Every eye that had any outlet for such a purpose, was riveted on the main-deck ports of le Téméraire in expectation of seeing the fire issue from her guns. Each instant, however, lessened the chances, as regarded that particular vessel, which was soon out of the line of fire from the Plantagenet, when the same scene was to follow with the same result, in connection with le Conquereur, the second ship of the French line. Sir Gervaise smiled as he passed the three first ships, seemingly unnoticed; but as he drew nearer to the admiral, he felt confident this impunity must cease.|$|R
6000|$|After {{taking this}} {{look at the}} ship, our mate passed round the Summit, having two or three tumbles on his way in {{consequence}} of puffs of wind, {{until he reached the}} point over the gate-way, which was that nearest to the ship-yard. It now occurred to him that possibly it might become necessary to look a little to the security of the Neshamony, for by this time the water on the reef was two or three feet deep. To his surprise, on looking round for Bob, whom he thought to be at work securing property near the gateway, he ascertained that the honest fellow had waded down to the ship-yard, and clambered on board the pinnace, with a view to take care of her. The distance between the point where Mark now stood and the Neshamony exceeded half a mile, and communication with the voice would have been next to impossible, had the wind not blown as it did. With the roaring of the seas, and the howling of the gale, it was of course entirely out of the question. Mark, however, could see his friend, and see that he was gesticulating, in the most earnest manner, for himself to join him. Then it was he first perceived that the pinnace was in motion, seeming to move on her ways. Presently the blockings were washed from under her, and the boat went <b>astern</b> <b>half</b> her length at a single surge. Mark made a bound down the hill, intending to throw himself into the racing surf, and to swim off to the aid of Betts; but, pausing an instant to choose a spot at which to get down the steep, he looked towards the ship-yard, and saw the pinnace lifted on a sea, and washed fairly clear of the land! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{happened}} to me," [...] said Osborn. [...] "I fell overboard. There {{was a heavy}} sea running, {{but no one was}} much alarmed about me, because we had on board a newly patented life-saving device which was believed to be competent to rescue anything that could fall overboard, from a midshipman to an anchor. Ours was the only ship that had this device; we were very proud of it, and had been anxious to give its powers a practical test. This thing was lashed to the garboard-strake of the main-to'gallant mizzen-yard amidships,[19] and {{there was nothing to do}} but cut the lashings and heave it over; it would do the rest. One day the cry of 'Man overboard!' brought all hands on deck. Instantly the lashings were cut and the machine flung joyously over. Damnation, it went to the bottom like an anvil! By the time that the ship was brought to and a boat manned, I was become but a bobbing speck on the waves <b>half</b> a mile <b>astern</b> and losing my strength very fast; but by good luck there was a common seaman on board who had practical ideas in his head and hadn't waited to see what the patent machine was going to do, but had run aft and sprung over after me the moment the alarm was cried through the ship. I had a good deal of a start of him, and the seas made his progress slow and difficult, but he stuck to his work and fought his way to me, and just in the nick of time he put his saving arms about me when I was about to go down. He held me up until the boat reached us and rescued us. By that time I was unconscious, and I was still unconscious when we arrived at the ship. A dangerous fever followed, and I was delirious for three days; then I come to myself and at once inquired for my benefactor, of course. He was gone. We were lying at anchor in the Bay and every man had deserted to the gold-mines except the commissioned officers. I found out nothing about my benefactor but his name--Burton Sanders--a name which I have held in grateful memory ever since. Every time I have been on the Coast, these twelve or thirteen years, I have tried to get track of him, but have never succeeded. I wish I could find him and make him understand that his brave act has never been forgotten by me. Harte, I would rather see him and take him by the hand than any other man on the planet." ...|$|R
