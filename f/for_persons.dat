5|$|Much {{of what he}} did in the Senate can be {{described}} as the typical sponsorship of legislation that would benefit his state.

He was more successful with bills aimed at prosecuting the ongoing campaign against the Seminole Indians, although the problem seems to have been overstated. His bills would provide compensation <b>for</b> <b>persons</b> who had suffered from the depredations of Indian raids, and would further the process of removing the aborigines from the state. He also introduced bills that provided for marine hospitals in port cities in Florida. None of this would have been considered exceptional for the era.|$|E
