This paper focuses {{on the level of}} efficiency improvements gained by using <b>e-Marketplaces</b> in the procurement process. Findings from a survey among 88 international airlines reveal that the use of Business-to-Business (B 2 B) <b>e-Marketplaces</b> does play different roles across the various airline groupings. Airlines that are involved in strategic alliances show higher joint procurement activities than airlines that are not involved in strategic alliances. However, alliances are probably viewed as loose arrangements and thus airlines may be reluctant to share information on procurement prices and processes with another airline that could also be acting as a competitor. The financial involvement in or initiation of <b>e-Marketplaces</b> by airlines is very low. Low cost airlines show high use of <b>e-Marketplaces,</b> but demonstrate little financial involvement in contrast.

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to explore}} the effect of <b>e-marketplace</b> on the supply chain's {{performance}} under the markdown policy. Profit and risk analyses are both conducted and channel coordination issues are examined. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a markdown policy supply chain analytical model with <b>e-marketplace</b> and examines the optimal markdown policy. The mean-variance theory is employed to study both the risk and profit residing in the supply chain. Extensive numerical analysis is conducted. The paper investigates both the cases when <b>e-marketplace</b> selling price is exogenous and endogenous. Findings: The markdown policy can coordinate the supply chain {{as long as the}} parameters satisfy certain analytical conditions. The expected profit and risk in the supply chain are both increased when <b>e-marketplace</b> is introduced. The retailer shares a larger portion of the increased expected profit {{but at the same time}} bears a higher risk. Research limitations/implications: In this study, similar to the mainstream literature in the related area, the supply chain consists of one manufacturer and one retailer, and there is one single selling season with one product. Despite being able to generate interesting analytical results, this model fails to capture the more complicated real world practices. Practical implications: The existence of <b>e-marketplace</b> can be beneficial to the whole supply chain in terms of expected profit improvement. When the expected profit increase brought about by <b>e-marketplace</b> is large enough to compensate for both the operational cost of <b>e-marketplace</b> and the increase of the risk, the retailer could consider introducing <b>e-marketplace</b> to dispose of the excess inventory. Originality/value: This paper is an original work. It is based on the reviewed literature and the model with markdown policy is new.

40|$|Business-to-business (B 2 B) {{electronic}} marketplaces (e-marketplaces) {{are one of}} {{the most}} heralded developments in recent years. These marketplaces bring together businesses buying and selling goods and services in an online buying community. E-marketplaces promise to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of procurement activities by replacing traditional manual processes with automated electronic procedures and by expanding the number of available trading partners. Despite the technology availability and the high potential benefits, very few e-marketplaces have succeeded. This three-year study identifies and investigates two major B 2 B <b>e-marketplace</b> stumbling blocks: attracting a sufficient number of members, and then influencing these members to use the <b>e-marketplace.</b> This investigation uses a variety of qualitative techniques to solicit information from nearly fifty executives representing four B 2 B e-marketplaces with contrasting membership and use levels. Within each <b>e-marketplace,</b> the study solicited information from high and low use organizations, buying and selling organizations, and a nonparticipant organization. The interview data was analyzed using line-by-line analysis from grounded theory. The analysis involved assimilating the unique stories of each manager into drivers that affect <b>e-marketplace</b> membership or use. These drivers were then compared to membership levels and/or use levels. The analysis resulted in three research models. Each research model is a data-driven representation of factors driving B 2 B <b>e-marketplace</b> membership, B 2 B <b>e-marketplace</b> use, and a particular organization's B 2 B <b>e-marketplace</b> use.

40|$|Abstract—An {{electronic}} marketplace (<b>e-marketplace)</b> {{is a common}} business information space populated with many entities of different system types. Each of them has its own context of how to process activities. This leads to heterogeneous <b>e-marketplace</b> activities, which are difficult to make interoperable and inferred from one entity to another. This study solves this problem by proposing a concept of separation strategy and implementing it through providing a semantic inference engine with a novel inference algorithm. The solution, called the RuleXPM approach, enables one to semantically infer a next <b>e-marketplace</b> activity across multiple contexts/domains. Experiments show that the crosscontext/cross-domain semantic inference is achievable. This paper is an understanding of many aspects related to heterogeneous activity inference.
