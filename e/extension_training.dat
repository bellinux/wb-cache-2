25|$|A 2007 study, {{conducted}} by Blazevich et al., reiterated and added an extra dimension to Aagaard et al.’s conclusions. Blazevich et al. examined {{the effect of}} 10-week concentric or eccentric knee <b>extension</b> <b>training</b> on architectural properties of the human quadriceps {{with the purpose of}} uncovering the mechanical stimulus involved in architecture adaptation. Both modes of exercise resulted in increased peak concentric and eccentric strength. Concentric training, however, results in higher peak concentric strength. Ultrasonography suggests vastus medialus and vastus lateris muscle fiber length increase similarly following eccentric and concentric training, with the changes occurring abruptly over the first 5 weeks of the training program. Because fiber length was independent of training type, Blazevich et al. believe distance of operation determines the optimal fiber length. This muscle property is important in determining the angle-torque relationship of a muscle. The study supported the pennation angle trends uncovered by Aagaard et al.; in addition, Blazevich et al. concluded that the vastus lateris fascicle angle changes are independent of training type and modulates strongly with volume. This suggests fiber length and pennation angle modifications occur via separate mechanical stimuli, i.e. distance of operation and muscle volume respectively. Furthermore, these angle changes occur over a relatively long time scale as the pennation angle increased until the cessation of the training program at week 10. Blazevich et al. predict the increase in pennation angle seen after eccentric or concentric training allow the pennate muscle to attach more fibers to the associated aponeurosis as well as increase PCSA and AGR. Architectural modifications to pennate muscles shift the position at which the muscle operates on the force-velocity and force-length curves to regions best suited for the muscle’s function. An increase in pennation angle theoretically increases both the PCSA and AGR of a given pennate muscle, allowing the muscle to generate higher forces while operating at higher optimal speeds. An increase to fiber length would allow the muscle to function at longer lengths.|$|E

With late Alhaji Imrana Yazidu, Professor Ango Abdullahi and others, they established the Extension Research Liaison Services (ERLS), which later metamorphosed into the NAERLS. After serving as an extension entomologist at the NAERLS, Ochapa Onazi became the Deputy Director and substantive Director of the Division of Agricultural Colleges (DAC) in 1973 and 1974 respectively. He held that position for ten years until his appointment as the Provost of the Makurdi Campus of the University of Jos in Benue State following the merger of the defunct Federal University of Technology, Makurdi in 1984 with the University of Jos by the Federal Government.
