40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} type of <b>jointly</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>entity</b> influences the management choice to report interests {{in this kind of}} joint venture using the equity method or proportionate consolidation. We address this gap in the accounting choice literature by exploiting the UK setting where, due to the transition to IFRS, firms had to change their reporting method for interests in jointly controlled entities from the gross equity method to a similar approach (equity method) or to proportionate consolidation. We support our analysis on the classification of jointly controlled entities proposed by Hennart (1988). We hypothesize that venturers are more likely to change their reporting method to proportionate consolidation when the majority of their jointly controlled entities are cases of Link instead of Scale cooperation. After controlling for several variables, our results are consistent with the predictions and thus suggest that {{the type of}} <b>jointly</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>entity</b> {{plays an important role in}} the management decision to report interests in jointly controlled entities using the equity method or proportionate consolidation. However, the results also provide empirical evidence supporting the importance of debt covenant costs and monitoring costs in the choice between alternative reporting methods. 1...|$|E
40|$|Relying on the {{opportunistic}} view {{of contracting}} theory, the paper explores {{the influence of}} blockholders, bondholders and families on the managerial accounting for interests in <b>jointly</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>entities.</b> In particular, it assumes that the equity method is an opportunistic accounting choice as it improves firm performance and induces managerial self-dealing rather than efficient contracting. The paper examines a sample of Italian listed companies holding interests in <b>jointly</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>entities</b> through a logistic regression analysis. Findings show that the family influence encourages the opportunistic choice of equity method, while the monitoring role played by blockholders and bondholders discourages {{the use of the}} performance-improving technique. The research contributes to the literature on contracting theory and corporate governance and has also practical implications for evaluating the appropriateness of IFRS 11...|$|R

40|$|No {{theoretical}} and empirical consensus exists on the appropriate reporting method for interests in <b>Jointly</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Entities</b> (JCEs).

50|$|The {{consolidated}} profit {{attributable to}} shareholders, in 2009, was HK$1,336 million, representing {{a gain of}} 12.7 percent. The increase was primarily due to the substantially lower impairment allowances, positive contributions from all the <b>jointly</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>entities,</b> improved fee income from securities related business and treasury operation. The return on average total assets and return on average equity stood at 1.2 percent and 8.7 percent respectively. Capital adequacy ratio remained strong at 19 percent, while the liquidity ratio was 55 percent. The additional compensation made for the Lehman Brothers Minibonds Repurchase Scheme had {{a negative impact on}} the Bank’s cost-to-income ratio and it increased to 43.7 percent. Excluding the additional compensation, the ratio would have been 34.9 percent; in 2008, it was 34.3 percent.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to analyze the current state of {{consolidated}} reporting practice harmonization concerning the choice of presenting the income statement, the changes in equity, the methods used for presenting the cash flow statement, the extant methods for evaluating and reporting goodwill, the extant methods in which <b>jointly</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>entities</b> are accounted in the consolidated financial statements, or the choice for recognizing investments in subsidiaries, <b>jointly</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>entities</b> and associates in the separate statements of the parent company. In order to achieve our goal we selected the first 10 groups, in order of their capitalization value, that were listed on each of the following capital markets: London Stock Exchange, NYSE Euronext (Paris Stock Exchange) and Deutsche Börse (Frankfurt Stock Exchange) and we analyzed, in a qualitative and in a quantitative manner, for a period of six years starting with 2007, their consolidated financial statements with the design to establish exactly which of the aspects stated in the International Financial Reporting Standards were being used for the items presented above. In order to complete the empirical research part of the paper that addresses from a comparative perspective the evaluation of the degree of material harmony between the reporting practices of groups listed on the three stock exchanges above-mentioned, we used statistical and mathematical methods represented by the I Index first described by Van der Tas. Taking into account the fact that since 2005 all listed companies on the European stock exchanges were required to adopt the international accounting standards for their consolidated financial disclosures, the degree of material harmony was studied only in reference to those requirements that presented two methods or possibilities of disclosure. Our findings suggest that the groups analyzed present a high degree of material harmonization with respect to the reporting practices considered, especially in the last three years...|$|R
40|$|The International Accounting Standards Committee {{issued the}} the International Accounting Standard 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements. IAS 27 {{provides}} guidance on the preparation and presentation of {{consolidated financial statements}} {{for a group of}} <b>entities</b> under the <b>control</b> of a parent. The standard also provides guidance on the presentation of investments in subsidiaries, <b>jointly</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>entities</b> and associates in separate financial statements. The objective of IAS 27 is to enhance the relevance, reliability, and comparability of the information contained in consolidated financial statements that a parent prepares for the group of entities it controls; and separate (non-consolidated) financial statements that a parent, investor, or venturer elects to provide, or is required by local regulation to provide.

40|$|Abstract In May 2011, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) {{issued a}} set of new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) which are {{effective}} for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 : (i) IFRS 10 - Consolidated Financial Statements, (ii) IFRS 11 - Joint Arrangements and (iii) IFRS 12 - Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities. The European Union (Regulation No 1254 / 2012) endorsed these standards and it has established that each company shall apply them, at the latest, as from the commencement date of its first financial year starting on or after 1 January 2014. In particular, this paper focus the attention on the new requirements established by IFRS 11. This new standard supersedes IAS 31 - Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC- 13 <b>Jointly</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Entities</b> – Non-Monetary Contributions by Venturers, in order to arrive at an accounting treatment which accurately reflects {{the true nature of}} the economic interest held by parties to a joint arrangement. By issuing IFRS 11, the IASB introduced an overhaul of the existing accounting for joint arrangements. In this regard, Management should carefully evaluate the new requirements, as they may have a significant impact on how an entity can present its income statement and balance sheet. This paper - that is a part of a bigger project - aims to analyse the new criteria established under IFRS 11 and to highlight what are, at this stage, the main “critical points” that companies will face by applying the new standard...|$|R
40|$|In May 2011, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) {{issued a}} set of new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) which are {{effective}} for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 : (i) IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, (ii) IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, and (iii) IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities. The European Union (Regulation No 1254 / 2012) endorsed these standards and it has established that each company shall apply them, at the latest, as from the commencement date of its first financial year starting on or after 1 January 2014. In particular, this thesis focuses on the new requirements established by IFRS 11. This new standard supersedes IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC- 13 <b>Jointly</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Entities</b> – Non-Monetary Contributions by Venturers and applies to all entities that are party to a joint arrangement (while all of the disclosure requirements for joint arrangements are included in IFRS 12). By issuing IFRS 11, the IASB introduced {{an overhaul of the}} existing accounting for joint arrangements. In this regard, management should carefully evaluate the new requirements, as they may {{have a significant impact on}} how an entity can present its income statement and balance sheet. The innovations established under IFRS 11 mainly regard two aspects: (i) the classification (and the accounting requirements) now focus on rights and obligations of the parties as criteria for demarcation between joint operations and joint ventures; (ii) the accounting option for joint ventures has been eliminated; consequently, all joint ventures have to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method (IFRS 11. 24). In this regard, this thesis aims to analyse the new criteria established under IFRS 11 and to investigate its effects on consolidated financial statements. Since the application of IFRS 11 is not at full speed within the EU, complete empirical researches are not possible right now. In fact, the annual reports of the entities applying IFRS 11 are not available at this stage, so we cannot be certain about the effects of adopting the standard. However, initial empirical evidence of the effects of IFRS 11 on consolidated financial statements are provided in the last chapter of this thesis through a case study. To this end, it is illustrated how an international Group dealt with all the phases that had led to the implementation of this new standard. Moreover, thanks to the data of the Group interim financial report, it is also illustrated the impact of IFRS 11 on the main key performance indicators...|$|R

30|$|In this section, we {{investigate}} the signalling load at the <b>control</b> <b>entities</b> {{of a traditional}} LTE/EPC architecture, a reference architecture [14, 15], and our full OEPC architecture.

The signalling loads at these <b>control</b> <b>entities</b> caused by five aforementioned procedures are considered as the evaluation metric. For convenience, we called the proposed architecture described in [14, 15] as a partial OEPC architecture because this architecture was also designed by using Openflow technology but it only separated the control and data plane of the SGWs while keeping the PGW {{the same as that}} in the traditional LTE/EPC architecture. In contrast, our fully OEPC decoupled completely the control and data plane of SGW as well as PGW and put all the control functions of those gateways into the MC.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Firewalls are {{a crucial}} {{building}} block for secur-ing interconnections between networks of different security domains. Newer IP based {{applications such as}} IP telephony require that packet filters are configured dynamically by session-aware entities. Several architectures and protocols were proposed for firewall remote control (e. g., IETF MIDCOM and NSIS). However, on the nodes that could host the <b>control</b> <b>entity</b> no common local interface for managing packet filter rules exists. This forces developers of firewall <b>control</b> <b>entities</b> to use firewall specific interfaces and limits portability across operating systems and firewall implementations. This paper describes the design of an operating system independent interface, which allows the firewall <b>control</b> <b>entity</b> to modify firewall rules from user space. We implemented this interface for Netfilter chains of the Linux operating system kernel taking functional and security requirements into account. Based on measurements, we analyze the performance characteristics and conclude that the approach is feasible for small to medium network setups. I...|$|R
