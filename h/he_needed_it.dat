5|$|During the {{previous}} night, at 20:00 September 4, General Walker {{had ordered the}} 1st Provisional Marine Brigade released from operational control of the 2nd Division effective at midnight, September 5. He had vainly protested against releasing the brigade, believing <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it</b> and all the troops then in Korea {{if he were to}} stop the North Korean offensive against the Pusan Perimeter. At 00:15, September 6, the marines began leaving their lines at Obong-ni Ridge and headed for Pusan. They would join the 1st Marine Regiment and 7th Marine Regiment in forming the new 1st Marine Division.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 1910 Smoller, using the name Joe Levi, visited Exchange Buildings, a small cul-de-sac that backed onto the properties of Houndsditch. He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it</b> for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around £7,000. Over {{the next two weeks}} the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 303, {{following}} a series of rebellions in Melitene (Malatya, Turkey) and Syria, a second edict was published, ordering the arrest and imprisonment of all bishops and priests. In the judgment of historian Roger Rees, there was no logical necessity for this second edict; that Diocletian issued one indicates that he was either unaware the first edict was being carried out, or that {{he felt it was}} not working as quickly as <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it</b> to. Following the publication of the second edict, prisons began to fillthe underdeveloped prison system of the time could not handle the deacons, lectors, priests, bishops, and exorcists forced upon it. Eusebius writes that the edict netted so many priests that ordinary criminals were crowded out, and had to be released.|$|E

5|$|Walker had protested in vain against {{releasing}} the brigade, believing <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it</b> {{and all the}} troops then in Korea {{if he were to}} stop the North Korean offensive against the Pusan Perimeter. The order prompted a heated disagreement between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. Walker said he could not hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur said he could not conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning two newly arrived units of the 3rd Infantry Division, the 17th Infantry Regiment and the 65th Infantry Regiment to Walker's reserves. Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective, and believed the transition endangered the Pusan Perimeter {{at a time when it}} was unclear if it could hold back the North Koreans. The brigade moved to Japan and merged with the 1st Marine Division. It was deactivated as an independent unit for the last time on 13 September 1950.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of fast algorithms for DFT {{can be traced}} to Gauss's unpublished work in 1805 when <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it</b> to interpolate the orbit of asteroids Pallas and Juno from sample observations. His method was very similar to the one published in 1965 by Cooley and Tukey, who are generally credited for the invention of the modern generic FFT algorithm. While Gauss's work predated even Fourier's results in 1822, he did not analyze the computation time and eventually used other methods to achieve his goal.|$|E

25|$|On {{the same}} date, Sheridan's cavalry crossed the James River on a pontoon bridge at Deep Bottom in Henrico County, Virginia, 11 miles (18km) {{southeast}} of Richmond. Sheridan went {{ahead of his}} men to meet Grant at his headquarters at Appomattox Manor, the Richard Eppes plantation at City Point, Virginia. Grant told Sheridan that Sheridan would continue to report directly to him, not to Major General George G. Meade {{as part of the}} Army of the Potomac. He also assured Sheridan that his force would participate in closing the war in the movements at Petersburg and that Grant gave him discretionary authority to go to North Carolina in his March 24 orders only in the event <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it.</b> In the afternoon, Grant and Sheridan accompanied President Lincoln on a cruise up the James River.|$|E
25|$|Byrne {{significantly}} reduced Superman's powers (though {{he was still}} one of the most powerful beings on Earth), eliminated the Fortress of Solitude and super-dog Krypto, and kept Jonathan and Martha Kent alive into Clark's adulthood to enjoy their adopted son's triumphs, as well as to provide him with support, grounding, and advice whenever <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it.</b> Byrne also used Marv Wolfman's idea of making Lex Luthor a wealthy business owner in addition to a scientific genius with a deadly vendetta against the superhero. Byrne did away with the childhood/teenage career as Superboy; in his revamped history, Clark Kent does not put on a costume and become a super-hero until adulthood. This approach to Kent's path to becoming Superman was later used in the action-adventure series Smallville on the WB Television Network and in the 2005 novel It's Superman by Tom De Haven.|$|E

On the June24 episode of Impact!, James Mitchell returned to the promotion in a backstage segment with Abyss. Mitchell propositioned Abyss {{on the idea of}} an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match, which Abyss agreed to, creating a partnership between the two. With Mitchell as Abyss' new manager, Abyss attacked Raven later during the show, setting up a match between the two at the PPV. Raven challenged Abyss to a Dog Collar match with [...] "No Surrender" [...] rules in which the only way to win was by pinfall at No Surrender on the July1 episode of Impact!, which was accepted.

Danny, who has now lost his mother, father, son and their friend, tries to focus on writing his next book, a follow-up to his previous eight semi-autobiographical novels. Then his last hope, Amy ("Lady Sky"), arrives on his doorstep. When Joe was 2, Amy had parachuted naked onto a pig farm Danny and Joe were visiting.

500|$|Borah was {{involved}} through the 1920s in efforts for the outlawry of war. [...] Chicago lawyer Salmon Levinson, who had formulated {{the plan to}} outlaw war, labored long to get the mercurial Borah on board as its spokesman. Maddox suggested that Borah was most enthusiastic about this plan when <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it</b> as a constructive alternative to defeat actions such as entry into the World Court, that he deemed entangling the U.S. abroad. By {{the time of the}} 1924 election, Levinson was frustrated with Borah, but Coolidge's statement after the election that outlawry was one of the issues he proposed [...] to address, briefly resurrected Borah's enthusiasm. only to have it fall away again. It was not until 1927, when French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand proposed the U.S. and his nation enter into an agreement to [...] "outlaw war" [...] that Borah became interested again, though it took months of pestering by Levinson. In December 1927, Borah introduced a resolution calling for a multilateral version of Briand's proposal, and once the Kellogg–Briand Pact was negotiated and signed by various nations, secured ratification for that treaty by the Senate.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{publication}} of Understanding Media, McLuhan received an astonishing amount of publicity, making him perhaps the most publicized English teacher {{in the twentieth century}} and arguably the most controversial. This publicity began with the work of two California advertising executives, Howard Gossage and Gerald Feigen who used personal funds to fund their practice of [...] "genius scouting." [...] Much enamoured with McLuhan's work, Feigen and Gossage arranged for McLuhan to meet with editors of several major New York magazines in May 1965 at the Lombardy Hotel in New York. Philip Marchand reports that, as a direct consequence of these meetings, McLuhan was offered the use of an office in the headquarters of both Time and Newsweek, any time <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

[...] In May 2009, drummer Brad Pemberton stated that: [...] "everyone was a bit fried, so it was the right time to step back for a minute.

2500|$|Thus {{ended the}} {{extraordinary}} public career of Otto von Bismarck, who ... had {{presided over the}} affairs of a state he made great and glorious. ... Now the humble posture that he had necessarily adopted in his written communications with his royal master had become his real posture. The old servant, no matter how great and how brilliant, had become in reality what he had always played as on a stage: a servant who could be dismissed at will by his Sovereign. He had defended that royal prerogative because it had allowed him {{to carry out his}} immense will; now the absolute prerogative of the Emperor became what it has always been, the prerogative of the sovereign. Having crushed his parliamentary opponents, flattened and abused his ministers, and refused to allow himself to be bound by any loyalty, Bismarck had no ally left when <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it.</b> It was not his cabinet nor his parliamentary majority. He had made sure that it remained the sovereign's, {{and so it was that}} he fell because of a system that he preserved and bequeathed to the unstable young Emperor.|$|E

2500|$|The 3D Mario games {{introduced}} Toad's role as {{a helper}} who would provide assistance to Mario if <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it,</b> thus making him one of Mario's major allies. In Super Mario 64, Toad explains the backstory to Mario, as well as telling him {{what he has to}} do to proceed in the game. In the game's remake Super Mario 64 DS, Toad appears with the same role; however, he is given character-specific remarks (such as mistaking Luigi for Mario in green clothes or thinking that Wario would betray the rest of the group). In Luigi's Mansion, Toad appears in various parts of the mansion as a save point. Different colored Toads appear in Super Mario Sunshine as Peach's attendants. In Super Mario Galaxy, Toads appear at the beginning of the game as some of the citizens of Toad Town. Later on, a group of Toads appear as the Toad Brigade led by new character, Captain Toad, the captain of the brigade, who attempt to help Mario or Luigi retrieve the Power Stars. [...] Toad himself appears in the intro of the game, where he is holding hands with Toadette as the two look at the night sky. Captain Toad makes a reappearance in the sequel, Super Mario Galaxy 2, once again as the same cowardly character as before.. Like in the first game, he and his brigade would attempt to help Mario retrieve the Power Stars in order to save Princess Peach.|$|E
