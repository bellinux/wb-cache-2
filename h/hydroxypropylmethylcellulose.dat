40|$|The {{relationship}} between postprandial blood glucose levels and meal viscosity was studied by adding various combinations of <b>hydroxypropylmethylcellulose</b> to glucose solutions and administering them to female mongrel dogs. Glucose was administered as 5 % or 20 % solutions in water. <b>Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose</b> was dissolved in the glucose solutions to yield low (5000 cP measured at 37 [deg]C and 1 s- 1), medium (15 000 cP) or high (30 000 cP) viscosities. High viscosity <b>hydroxypropylmethylcellulose</b> significantly reduced the maximum blood glucose concentration, Cmax, by 60 % (5 % glucose meal) and 40 % (20 % glucose meal) while reducing the area under the blood level vs. time curve (AUC 0 - 3 h) by 40 - 50 %. Medium viscosity <b>hydroxypropylmethylcellulose</b> reduced the Cmax at both glucose levels, but reduced the AUC {{only for the}} 5 % glucose meal. Low viscosity HPMC lowered the Cmax only after the 5 % glucose meal, and had no {{significant effect on the}} AUC at either glucose level. The average time to reach maximum concentration, Tmax, was prolonged two- to three-fold at all viscosity levels for the 5 % glucose solutions, but was not affected when 20 % glucose solutions were administered.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was to achieve colon specific delivery of sennosides using the polysaccharide pectin as a compression-coating agent. In this study, pectin along with <b>hydroxypropylmethylcellulose</b> was used for compression coating of the core tablets of calcium sennoside. Drug dissolution and erosion studies were carried out in pH 1. 2 and phosphate buffer pH 7. 4 using a pectinolytic enzyme. The system was designed based on the gastrointestinal transit time concept, assuming colon arrival time to be 6 h. It was found that pectin alone was not sufficient to protect the core tablets during entire gastrointestinal transit time. Addition of <b>hydroxypropylmethylcellulose</b> was required to control the erosion of tablets. In this investigation a 3 2 factorial design was constructed to investigate the influence of two variables; the amount of <b>hydroxypropylmethylcellulose</b> (X 1) and coat weight of the tablets (X 2) on the time taken for 50 &#x 0025; erosion of tablet in presence of pectinase enzyme (TE 50) and average percent weight difference between tablets with and without enzyme at the 10 th hour (&#x 0025; WD).

METHODS: This prospective, randomized clinical trial comprised 78 eyes (39 patients) that received phacoemulsification performed by the same surgeon using a standardized technique. Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either 1. 6 % hyaluronic acid/ 4. 0 % chondroitin sulfate or 2. 0 % <b>hydroxypropylmethylcellulose</b> on the first eye. The other eye was treated later and received the other viscoelastic agent. Preoperative and postoperative examinations (5, 24 and 48 hours; 7 and 14 days; 3 and 6 months) included measurements of the total volume of the ophthalmic viscosurgical device, ultrasound and washout times to completely remove the ophthalmic viscosurgical device, intraocular pressure, central corneal thickness and best-corrected visual acuity. The corneal endothelial cell count was measured at baseline and at six months postoperatively. ClinicalTrials. gov: NCT 01387620. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between groups in terms of cataract density or ultrasound time. However, it took longer to remove 2. 0 % <b>hydroxypropylmethylcellulose</b> than 1. 6 % hyaluronic acid/ 4. 0 % chondroitin sulfate, and the amount of viscoelastic material used was greater in the 2. 0 % <b>hydroxypropylmethylcellulose</b> group. In addition, the best-corrected visual acuity was significantly better in the hyaluronic acid/ chondroitin sulfate group, but this preferable outcome was only observed at 24 hours after the operation. There were no statistically {{significant differences between the two}} ophthalmic viscosurgical devices regarding the central corneal thickness or intraocular pressure measurements at any point in time. The corneal endothelial cell count was significantly higher in the hyaluronic acid/chondroitin sulfate group. CONCLUSION: The ophthalmic viscosurgical device consisting of 1. 6 % hyaluronic acid/ 4. 0 % chondroitin sulfate was more efficient during phacoemulsification and was easier to remove after IOL implantation than 2. 0 % <b>hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.</b> In addition, the corneal endothelial cell count was significantly higher following the use of hyaluronic acid/chondroitin sulfate than with <b>hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,</b> which promoted an improved level of corneal endothelium protection...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was the preparation of dry-coated tablets designed for colonic release of the model drug Diclofenac sodium (DS). The system consists of a drug-pectine (PC) mixture as the core and <b>hydroxypropylmethylcellulose</b> (HPMC) alone or mixed in different ratios with poly(ε-caprolactone) (CL) as the coat layer...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{influence}} of <b>hydroxypropylmethylcellulose</b> 4000 in the protection of Piroxicam polymorphs which could appear during the processes of formulation of extended release tablets. The physico-chemical tests and the dissolution profiles of polymorphs and tablets showed that the metolose incorporated in the tablets at a rate equivalent to 5 % could possibly act doubly; initially by protecting the piroxicam polymorphism transition (form II) during compression, then modulating its in vitro release (extended release) ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The work aims to {{investigate}} the effect ofhydrophilic and hydrophobic polymers swelling and erosionon the release behaviour of DCL-Na from controlled matrixtablets prepared by direct compression and wet-granulationtechniques. Materials and Methods: Powder preformulation studies wereconducted. Tablets were prepared by direct compressiontechnique and their physicochemical properties wereevaluated. Drug-polymer interaction was analyzed by FTIRspectroscopy. The in-vitro drug release study was conductedusing phosphte buffer pH 7. 4 as dissolution medium anddifferent kinetic parameters were applied. Results and Discussion: F- 1 and F- 5 containing ethycelluloseprepared by direct compression and wet granulationtechniques released 94 % and 84 % drug after 24 hrs, while F- 2 and F- 6 containing <b>hydroxypropylmethylcellulose</b> polymerprepared by direct compression and wet granulation released 98. 46 % and 91. 25 % drug after within 24 hrs respectively. Ethylcellulose and <b>hydroxypropylmethylcellulose</b> based matrixtablets showed the best anomalous drug release behaviour,with the release exponents “ n ” ranging from 0. 685 to 0. 809. Conclusion: It has been concluded that ethylcellulose etherderivative polymer is used to prepare oral controlled releasematrix tablet of diclofenac sodium.

40|$|Evaluation of Celluloses and Maize Starch by the Creep Test Method The aim of {{this work}} was to {{consider}} the appropriateness of using the creep test for evaluation of visco-elastic characteristics of pharmaceutical fillers and to compare these properties. Pharmaceutical powders involved in this assessment were powdered cellulose (Vitacel A 300), hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC, Natrosol 250), hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC, Klucel EF), <b>hydroxypropylmethylcellulose</b> (HPMC, K 100) and maize starch. The powders were compressed with a material-testing machine T 1 -FRO 50 by compression forces of 0, 25; 0, 5; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 7, 5; 10 and 15 kN. Compression data for each tablet were then recorded by a software connected to the compressing machine. The recorded data, such as die displacement and time, were transferred into relation between creep compliance (J) and time. Obtained values were then used for calculating the parameters such as immediate elasticity (E 1), retarded elasticity (E 2), plasticity (P 1) and factor of plasticity (FP). To summarize all results, {{we can say that}} hydroxypropylcellulose has the highest values of elasticity and the lowest values of plasticity among all tested powders. Conversely <b>hydroxypropylmethylcellulose</b> shows the lowest elasticity and powdered cellulose presents the most plastic [...] ...|$|E
