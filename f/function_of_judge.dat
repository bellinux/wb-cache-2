40|$|U radu se analizira uloga obiteljskih veza u formiranju gradske elite na zagrebačkom Gradecu u vremenu od sredine 14. do početka 16. stoljeća. Na temelju izvornih podataka prvo se utvrđuju vršitelji funkcija, najviše gradski suci o kojima je sačuvano više podataka, a potom se identificiraju njihovi nasljednici ili članovi istih obitelji. Drugi dio donosi osvrt na neke značajke srednjovjekovnih gradskih obitelji, a u prilogu se nalaze tabele i genealoški prikazi najznačajnijih gradskih obitelji. Kinship {{and family}} ties {{exercised}} a great {{influence on the}} composition of the city magistracy, especially on the highest function within the magistracy, that of city judge and jurors. Belonging to an important family secured social reputation and status, and it was frequently the case that members of the same families held different positions within the same magistracy. It is particularly evident that city judges very frequently had some family member or kinsman who had served in previous years in the magistracy. Out of a total of 94 citizens who held the position of the city judge in the period considered here, from 1350 to 1525, family and kinship connections with some previous jurors and judges are established for 33 of them. Most frequently, the type of connection was affinal: that is to say, judges were most frequently sons-in-law or husbands of widows of former judges or jurors. There were fewer recorded patrilinear connections, and it is important to stress the rarity of cases of inheriting the <b>function</b> <b>of</b> <b>judge</b> {{on the basis of the}} patrilinear principle: it is established in only five cases that father and son held the position of city judge. Sons of judges more frequently remained only jurors or councillors. The importance of belonging to some distinguished family may be seen also in the fact that in Gradec at least fourteen different families could be identified whose closer or more distant members held the positions of judges for a shorter or longer period. However, the urban elite was not closed: many members of these families were in fact newcomers in the city, who obtained additional repute by marrying a daughter or a widow of some respectable citizen. Almost a third of the city judges in the period under research were newcomers, and for many of them it is established that they were connected by marriage to some older respectable family. In that fact, there may be observed the role of women in creating, integrating and consolidating urban elites. If only the biological aspect is considered, then we may say that long-lasting families in Gradec were the exception rather than the rule, because for only two families may it be established that they lasted in local politics for four generations, and very few lasted through three generations. The reasons for the disappearance of particular families were partly of a biological nature, caused by the high rate of mortality in medieval cities, and partly of an economic nature. The latter is frequently connected to inheritance-related matters, because sons and daughters of respected citizens had a right to equal shares of property, and thus, if a respected citizen had more children, an equal part of the inheritance belonged to each of them. Because of that, only rarely might sons live off their fathers’ inheritance, and they had to maintain their fathers’ success in business to retain their social standing...|$|E

In this Article, the Author advocates racial diversity among judges as a critical means of achieving cultural pluralism in judicial decision-making. Judicial diversity advocates have failed specifically and precisely to connect the demand for cultural pluralism in judicial decision-making to racial diversity efforts. Fear of tackling the myth of judicial impartiality and the failure to recognize the representative <b>function</b> <b>of</b> <b>judges</b> has resulted in an over-emphasis on the symbolic rather than the substantive value of judicial diversity.

40|$|Far from merely {{providing}} judges with {{a useful}} decision-rule, {{the doctrine of}} stare decisis reflects the fundamental values of the legal process and the primordial tension within the common law between change and stability.

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} how perception is achieved through interactions among the psychophysical <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> <b>judged</b> features <b>of</b> an object. The {{theory is that}} the perceiver places processed features in a multidimensional space of discriminal processes. Each dimension is scaled in units of discrimination performance. The zero coordinate of each feature is its level in an internal standard (norm) established by previous experience of that category of object in context. Experiments are reported which show that one, two, or three concurrent single-featured objects matched the multiple features of another object in two ways. Either stimulation from the two objects had discrimination distances from norm that added, or the stimulation by one object was processed through a concept describing stimulation by the other object. It follows that, in this case, perception via a receptor for the multi-featured object can be replaced by a point of balance among receptors for each single feature. The object with its own receptor is the gustatory stimulant L-glutamic acid as its monosodium salt. The features that stimulate diverse gustatory receptors of their own are sodium chloride, citric acid, sucrose, and caffeine. A more complex approach to dimensional coding was developed earlier for photoreceptors in colour judgments. The present approach is modality independent, mathematically simple, and economical in experimental data...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the legal}} {{mechanisms}} that {{have contributed to the}} strengthening of EU law in relation to national legal systems is the reference for preliminary rulings. Essentially, in this proceeding, the national court refers a question and the Court of Justice of the European Union, in a preliminary ruling, answer on the interpretation of EU law. Through these binding decisions with a jurisdictional nature, the European judge not only ensures an official interpretation of EU law but an uniformity of application. Unlike ordinary law court activity, where the object of judgment is a fact that is related to a rule of law, in a preliminary judgment, the object of judgment is the interpretation of EU law provision. Similarly, a national constitutional court acts, it being the only competent authority to interpret the Constitution of a State; from this perspective, the Court of Justice of the European Union is a true “European constitutional court” because it has the exclusive jurisdiction to interpret Community law. The interpretation <b>function</b> <b>of</b> the European <b>judge,</b> as well as that <b>of</b> constitutional <b>judge,</b> has certain features that distinguish the jurisdictional activity of a fundamental ordinary judge.

40|$|The {{jury system}} plays an {{important}} part in the administration of accident law. This means that procedural rules and devices which allocate power between court and jury may have great bearing on the way accident law actually works. And it also means that the practical implications of many a rule of substantive law can scarcely be appreciated without an understanding of just how the rule affects that allocation of power. This has been pointed out before. But there is a good deal of reason to believe that much of accident law is now in a period of transition from older notions based on individual blame or fault towards some form of social insurance roughly comparable to workmen 2 ̆ 7 s compensation.
