500|$|A {{reference}} work by Hal Leonard compares it to a pianist's approach, with Hendrix's [...] "thumb fret the bass notes, functioning in {{almost the same}} manner as a keyboardist's left hand, and the fingers of his <b>fretting</b> <b>hand</b> can be likened to a pianist's right hand". [...] Leonard also adds that guitarist Adrian Belew describes the technique as a [...] "lost art".|$|E
2500|$|King's bass playing {{style is}} {{largely based on}} {{continuous}} 16th notes (aka semiquavers), sometimes described as [...] "machine-gun" [...] style. This [...] "machine-gun" [...] style consists of playing rapidly {{using a combination of}} thumb slaps, pops, hammer-ons, and <b>fretting</b> <b>hand</b> slaps.|$|E
2500|$|The {{chromatic}} scale climbs from one string {{to the next}} {{after a number of}} frets that is specific to each regular tuning. The {{chromatic scale}} climbs after exactly four frets in major-thirds tuning, so reducing the extensions of the little and index fingers ("hand stretching"). For other regular tunings, the successive strings have intervals that are minorthirds, perfectfourths, augmentedfourths, or perfectfifths; thus, [...] the <b>fretting</b> <b>hand</b> covers three, five, six, or seven frets respectively to play a chromatic scale. (Of course, the lowest chromatic-scale uses the open strings and so requires one less fret to be covered.) ...|$|E
50|$|Shear's unique guitar style {{derives from}} tuning the guitar {{to an open}} G, but with an E in the bass, {{equivalent}} to an E minor seventh chord. The guitar is not strung left-hand style (with the strings installed in reverse order), but is held upside down, with the <b>fretting</b> <b>hand's</b> thumb wrapped down over the upper edge of the neck, barring across the strings, and the low E being at the thumb's tip.|$|R
5000|$|Adler joined Lamb of God {{after the}} first guitarist, Abe Spear, left the band. Self-taught, Adler {{is known for his}} {{unconventional}} style of playing, which includes odd or dissonant chords, unique timing patterns and rhythms, high usage of his <b>fretting</b> <b>hand's</b> pinky finger, wide stretches between frets due to an increased reach, and being an obsessive perfectionist with his right hand rhythm playing. He plays mostly the jagged staccato riffs in Lamb of God's songs, while Mark Morton plays more of the groove-oriented rhythms and solos.|$|R

2500|$|The G–B–C–Cm chord {{progression}} {{is repeated}} {{throughout the whole}} song, just alternating between arpeggiated chords in the verses and last chorus and loud power chords {{during the first two}} choruses. In G major, these may be interpreted as [...] "I–III–IV–iv". According to Guy Capuzzo, the ostinato musically portrays [...] "the song's obsessive lyrics, which depict the 'self-lacerating rage of an unsuccessful crush'." [...] For example, the [...] "highest pitches of the ostinato form a prominent chromatic line that 'creeps' up, then down, involving scale degrees – – – .... ascend, the lyrics strain towards optimism...descend, the subject sinks back into the throes of self-pity...The guitarist's <b>fretting</b> <b>hand</b> mirrors this contour".|$|E
5000|$|The <b>fretting</b> <b>hand</b> {{can also}} be used to sound notes, either by {{plucking}} an open string with the <b>fretting</b> <b>hand,</b> or, in the case of a string that has already been plucked or picked, by [...] "hammering on" [...] a higher pitch or [...] "pulling off" [...] a finger to pluck a lower fretted or open stringed note. Jazz bassists use a subtle form of <b>fretting</b> <b>hand</b> pizzicato by plucking a very brief open string grace note with the <b>fretting</b> <b>hand</b> right before playing the string with the plucking hand. When a string is rapidly hammered on, the note can be prolonged into a trill.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fretting</b> <b>hand</b> {{also comes}} into play in this {{approach}} to playing banjo. The <b>fretting</b> <b>hand</b> can hammer, pull off, slide and bend individual and groups of strings. This can create the illusion that the picking hand is doing something more than down-picking.|$|E
5|$|In major-thirds tuning, the {{chromatic}} scale is arranged on three consecutive strings in four consecutive frets. This four-fret arrangement facilitates the left-hand technique for classical (Spanish) guitar: For each hand position of four <b>frets,</b> the <b>hand</b> is stationary and the fingers move, each finger {{being responsible for}} one fret. Consequently, three hand-positions (covering frets 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12) partition the fingerboard of classical guitar, which has exactly 12 frets.|$|R
50|$|Fretboard tablature (unlike organ tablature) {{removes the}} {{requirement}} that the player determine the fretboard position to use to play the notated. Notes on the guitar can be played in different <b>fret</b> <b>hand</b> positions and on several different strings; for example the note C4 could be played on the third string at the fifth fret or on the fourth string at the tenth fret. In the case of fretted instruments such complexity makes the relationship between staff notation and playing technique less direct than {{in the case of}} the piano and many other instruments. Whilst standard staff notation can remove the string/fret ambiguity by further indicating the playing position (usually with Roman numerals), tablature does not contain this ambiguity. Tablature has two additional advantages. First, it clearly identifies the note. Tablature makes explicit all instances of musica ficta, so that there is no guesswork about whether a note is, for example, an F or an F. Second, tablature can notate music in different tunings and scordaturas. Third, for woodwind instruments tablature can be used to discriminate between different tone colours for the same pitch.|$|R
50|$|Brewer played {{primarily}} in the Hawaiian style with the guitar, face up, across the lap, intonated with a bar rather than <b>fretted</b> by <b>hand.</b> When {{he was born in}} Gage, Oklahoma Territory, Hawaiian music featuring the guitar would gain important public exposure at the 1904 Saint Louis World’s Fair. This music inspired musicians across the continent and eventually worldwide. Its influence on the music of the mainland would be profound through the mid 20th century.|$|R
5000|$|There is less {{need for}} <b>fretting</b> <b>hand</b> damping (muting) in playing chords, since only the strings that are {{required}} can be plucked.|$|E
5000|$|There is less {{need to use}} the <b>fretting</b> <b>hand</b> to damp {{notes in}} chords, since the guitarist can pluck just the {{required}} strings.|$|E
5000|$|Bending (especially heavy bending, {{more than}} one semitone) usually {{involves}} touching {{more than one}} string with a left (<b>fretting)</b> <b>hand,</b> {{as seen in the}} illustration.|$|E
5000|$|A slide, (neck of a bottle, {{knife blade}} or round metal or glass bar or cylinder) {{is used in}} blues and rock to create a {{glissando}} or [...] "Hawaiian" [...] effect. The slide is used to fret notes on the neck, instead of using the <b>fretting</b> <b>hand's</b> fingers. The characteristic use of the slide is to move up to the intended pitch by, as the name implies, sliding up the neck to the desired note. The necks of bottles were often used in blues and country music as improvised slides. Modern slides are constructed of glass, plastic, ceramic, chrome, brass or steel bars or cylinders, depending on the weight and tone desired (and {{the amount of money}} a guitarist can spend). An instrument that is played exclusively in this manner (using a metal bar) is called a steel guitar or pedal steel. Slide playing to this day is very popular in blues music and country music. Some slide players use a so-called Dobro guitar. Some performers who have become famous for playing slide are Robert Johnson, Elmore James, Ry Cooder, George Harrison, Bonnie Raitt, Derek Trucks, Warren Haynes, Duane Allman, Muddy Waters, Rory Gallagher, and George Thorogood.|$|R
50|$|In {{the left}} hand, each finger is {{responsible}} for exactly one fret. For each hand-position of four <b>frets,</b> the left <b>hand</b> is stationary while its fingers move. Consequently, three hand-positions (of frets 1-4, 5-8, and 9-12) cover the 12-fret octave of each string.|$|R
5000|$|Tapping is {{a guitar}} playing {{technique}} where a string is fretted and set into vibration {{as part of}} a single motion of being pushed onto the fretboard, as opposed to the standard technique being <b>fretted</b> with one <b>hand</b> and picked with the other.|$|R
50|$|Cédric Grégoire (better {{known as}} Lord Lokhraed) is the guitarist and lead vocalist of French black metal band Nocturnal Depression and has {{ectrodactyly}} on his <b>fretting</b> <b>hand,</b> which {{has only two}} fingers.|$|E
50|$|The spider chord {{requires}} the player {{to use all}} four fingers of the <b>fretting</b> <b>hand,</b> thus its name. This technique then allows one to run down the neck playing {{either of the two}} chords.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>fretting</b> <b>hand,</b> {{the left}} hand for {{right-handed}} bass players and the right hand for left-handed bass players, is used to press down the strings to play different notes and shape the tone or timbre of a plucked or picked note. One technique used in the <b>fretting</b> <b>hand</b> is known as [...] "a finger per fret", where each finger in the <b>fretting</b> <b>hand</b> plays one fret in a given position. Also, the double bass-style technique {{can be used for}} fretting. This technique involves the use of four fingers in the space of three frets, especially in the lower positions (i.e., the fretting positions closer to the nut, where the space between notes is the widest). When considering the spacing between notes, this is a comfortable distance for the average person's hand size. The main advantage of the [...] "four fingers in three frets" [...] technique is less tendon strain, leading to a diminished likelihood of Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). The [...] "four-in-three" [...] technique is demonstrated in the image below (a bassist performing tapping).|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} playing {{method for}} the guitarrón chileno is to pluck the strings with the finger tips and nails {{of the right}} hand. Typically only the {{thumb and index finger}} are employed, especially in the payada styles. The left <b>hand</b> <b>frets</b> strings on the fingerboard {{in a manner similar to}} that of the guitar and other guitar-like instruments.|$|R
5000|$|The stringing/tuning {{configuration}} of the Chapman Stick is advantageous to the player who wishes to play large, fully voiced chords with close inner-note relationships. In contrast to a standard guitar, where one tends to [...] "run out of options" [...] within a particular fingering, the Stick tuning results in up to 4 or even 5 octaves of note choices under each <b>hand's</b> <b>fretting</b> position.|$|R

50|$|For the <b>fretting</b> <b>hand,</b> the {{technique}} {{is close to the}} left-hand technique of Spanish classical guitar. The thumb is placed {{in the middle of the}} back of the neck, not over the back of the neck (to finger bass strings).|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to pressing down one note at a time, bassists can also press down several notes {{at one time}} with their <b>fretting</b> <b>hand</b> to perform a double stop (two notes at once) or a chord. While double stops and chords are used less often by bassists than by electric guitarists playing rhythm guitar, a variety of double stops and chords can be performed on the electric bass. Some double stops used by bassists include octaves. Chords can be especially with effective on instruments with higher ranges such as six-string basses. Another variation to fully pressing down a string is to gently graze the string with the finger at the harmonic node points on the string, which creates chime-like upper partials (also called [...] "overtones"). Glissando is an effect in which the <b>fretting</b> <b>hand</b> slides up or down the neck, {{which can be used}} to create a slide in pitch up or down. A subtle glissando can be performed by moving the <b>fretting</b> <b>hand</b> without plucking or picking the string; for a more pronounced effect, the string is plucked or picked first, or, in a metal or hardcore punk context, a pick may be scraped along the sides of the lower strings.|$|E

50|$|Pick tapping (or pick trilling) is a legato playing {{technique}} for the guitar, {{in which the}} edge of the pick is used to sharply trill notes on the instrument's fretboard at fast speeds. Whilst trilling can be performed with the fingers of either the <b>fretting</b> or picking <b>hand,</b> using the pick enables faster speeds by means of 'vibrating' (or effectively seizing up) the wrist. The technique {{should not be confused with}} regular tapping, which always makes use of both hands and involves playing at least three or more notes.|$|R
5000|$|The bassist {{can play}} many notes quickly by {{rotating}} the forearm, alternately slapping and popping: during the pop, the hand {{moves away from}} the fretboard, [...] "winding up" [...] or getting in position for the next slap. The slap and pop techniques are commonly used with pull-offs and hammer-ons with the <b>fretting</b> (usually left) <b>hand,</b> to further increase the rate at which notes may be played. Ghost notes, or notes played with the string damped, are also commonly played in slap bass to increase the percussive feel of the technique.|$|R
50|$|Some guitar-synthesizers consist {{with two}} {{separated}} parts, guitar controller and interface & sound module, where the former control the latter (as in Roland instruments). One {{of the challenges}} of using guitar-synthesizers is that not all guitar-playing techniques can be smoothly translated into MIDI and resulting sound. Harmonics, palm mutes, hammer-ons (in which the <b>fretting</b> <b>hand</b> strikes the string onto the fretboard), pull-offs, and pick slides are not easily picked up by guitar-synthesizers, usually due to sloppy <b>fretting</b> <b>hand</b> technique. With the exception of harmonics and palm mutes, these other techniques can be achieved with a concentrated effort to maintain good fretting technique. Similarly, synthesizer part of guitar-synth often lack the variety of controls (sliders, faders, and knobs) for synthesis parameters that are normally available on a standard keyboard synthesizer.|$|E
50|$|It {{incorporates}} {{the techniques of}} hammer-on and pull-off, but these are usually only performed by the <b>fretting</b> <b>hand,</b> and in conjunction with conventionally picked notes, whereas tap passages involve both hands and consist of only tapped, hammered and pulled notes. Some players (such as Stanley Jordan) rely extensively or exclusively on tapping.|$|E
50|$|Arpeggios on {{the guitar}} are {{typically}} executed as patterns running diagonally {{from the lower}} frets on the lower strings to the upper frets on the upper strings. Such patterns tend to have {{no more than two}} stopped notes per string, relating to the fact that Django could only articulate two fingers on his <b>fretting</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|Until the unholy train comes tearing along--which it {{presently}} does, {{ripping the}} sacred solitude to rags and tatters with its devil's warwhoop and the roar and thunder of its rushing wheels--and straightway you {{are back in}} this world, and with one of its <b>frets</b> ready to <b>hand</b> for your entertainment: for you remember {{that this is the}} very road whose stock always goes down after you buy it, and always goes up again as soon as you sell it. It makes me shudder to this day, to remember that I once came near not getting rid of my stock at all. It must be an awful thing to have a railroad left on your hands.|$|R
50|$|The twelve-string guitar's {{greater number}} of strings and higher {{cumulative}} string tension complicates playing, in both <b>hands.</b> <b>Fretting</b> chords requires greater force, and {{the width of the}} neck and the added string tension combine to make soloing and string-bending challenging. The gap between the dual-string courses is usually narrower than that between the single-string courses of a conventional six-string guitar, so more precision is required with the pick or fingertip when not simply strumming chords. Consequently, the instrument is most commonly used for accompaniment, though a handful of players have taken the time to develop the 12-string guitar as a solo instrument. Flat-picking solos are more frequently seen with electric players, whereas a few acoustic players, such as Leo Kottke, have developed very sophisticated fingerstyle techniques, and players such as Ralph Towner have even applied classical playing techniques.|$|R
5000|$|Imagine {{creating}} {{music on}} a stringed instrument that is simultaneously a guitar, a bass, a piano, and percussion. Add unlimited electronic capabilities and forward-thinking playing techniques for ultimate expression. Now, design a tuning to make navigation {{of the instrument}} amazingly simple, and streamline {{the look and feel}} for optimal accessibility. This instrument already exists as the Chapman Stick. Steve Adelson describing the Chapman Stick in Guitar Player magazine A Stick looks like a wide version of the fretboard of an electric guitar, but with 8, 10 or 12 strings. It is, however, considerably longer and wider than a guitar fretboard. Unlike the electric guitar, it is usually played by tapping or fretting the strings, rather than plucking them. Instead of one <b>hand</b> <b>fretting</b> and the other hand plucking, both hands sound notes by striking the strings against the fingerboard just behind the appropriate frets for the desired notes.|$|R
