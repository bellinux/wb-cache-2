40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to explore how <b>I</b> <b>can</b> meet {{children}} with different kinds of attention deficit disorders. What <b>can</b> <b>I</b> do when the child kicks me and makes me cry? How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it</b> right so that the child and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> feel good? In my text I am writing about how <b>I</b> <b>can</b> prioritize my way when I am angry. I wonder how to prioritize my feelings and feel safe with the other person. I am developing these questions in my text. My method is to reflect and question the knowledge I acquired during my work at the school. In the text I use literatures to the problem and have a short discussion with an old pedagogue. I am discussing myself when I meet the troublesome child and how <b>I</b> <b>can</b> deal with my own emotions. In the hard situation I {{have to look at}} the problem. I can’t see the bigger picture in this situation. For a good situation we need a solution and need to meet the child professionally with our own wise choices. I have not found a solution and I need to learn how <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> my own emotions at work and what skills I need to learn when I get angry in a difficult situation. ...|$|R
40|$|I {{want you}} to write a story. Look around: what do you see? Down to the last detail, I {{want you to}} decribe it. Every dusty piece of bric-a-brac, every chipped coffee mug with a dried ring of {{yesterday}} 2 ̆ 7 s caffeine fix at the bottom, every crumpled tissue in the wastebasket…bombard me with it. Leave nothing out. Like Zeus 2 ̆ 7 s migraine that yielded Athena, your characters live in your mind before they live on the page; even your blood relatives are not linked to you as profoundly. You 2 ̆ 7 re never alone because your characters love you back, with a love that transcends infatuation. In fact, their existence renders yours tolerable. That said, you do yourself and the reader a disservice if you omit back story. We need to know everything: where Joe W attended college, what he majored in, whom he dated, and whether he knocked any of them up; why Jennifer X wore this sweater today instead of that blazer she almost put on, whether she took the subway to work or a cab, what type of cocktail she ordered when she met her friend Janice Y for a drink before dinner. Amid all these minutiae [...] {{and this is the}} most important point, so you might want to write it down for future reference [...] nothing is allowed to happen. Can you do it? It sounds like a big job, creating nothing out of something, but <b>I</b> think you <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it.</b> Try a few writing exercises. Have a constructive dialogue with your inner child. Put on your thinking cap. Do your best. I promise it 2 ̆ 7 ll be brilliant...|$|R
