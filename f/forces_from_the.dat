5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the execution of King Louis XVI, revolutionary France was attacked by Prussian and Holy Roman <b>forces</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Austrian Netherlands. Though the French defeated the Austrian army in the Battle of Jemappes in 1792 and briefly occupied the Austrian Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric of Liège, they were pushed out by an Austrian counterattack in the Battle of Neerwinden the following year. In June 1794, French revolutionary troops expelled Holy Roman <b>forces</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> region for the last time after the Battle of Fleurus. The French government voted to formally annex the territory in October 1795 and it was split into nine provincial départements within France.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of July 1, Union cavalry in the {{division}} of Brig. Gen.

Confederate <b>forces</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> brigade of Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew had briefly clashed with Union forces the day before but believed they were Pennsylvania militia of little consequence, not the regular army cavalry that was screening {{the approach of the}} Army of the Potomac.|$|E
5|$|After Kalākaua's {{death and}} the {{accession}} of Queen Liliʻuokalani, Iaukea was reappointed colonel of the queen's personal military staff, and as agent of the Crown Lands. The monarchy was overthrown on January 17, 1893, by the Committee of Safety, {{with the support of}} United States Minister John L. Stevens, and the landing of American <b>forces</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> USS Boston. After a brief transition under the Provisional Government, the oligarchical Republic of Hawaii was established on July4, 1894, with Sanford B. Dole as president.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the mass behind a punch, {{it is essential to}} move the body as a unit throughout the punch. Power is generated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground up, such that <b>force</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ankles transfers to <b>the</b> knees; <b>force</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> knees transfers to <b>the</b> thighs; <b>force</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> thighs transfers to <b>the</b> core; <b>from</b> <b>the</b> core to <b>the</b> chest; <b>from</b> <b>the</b> chest to <b>the</b> shoulders; <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shoulders to the forearms and finally the compounded force transfers through the fist into an opponent. So the most powerful punchers are able to connect their whole body and channel <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>from</b> each portion of the body into a punch.|$|R

5|$|Another {{indication}} that feet and other tetrapod traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic is how they were feeding. They {{did not have the}} modifications of the skull and jaw that allowed them to swallow prey on land. Prey could be caught in the shallows, at the water's edge or on land, but had to be eaten in water where hydrodynamic <b>forces</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E

5|$|From November 1943, {{during the}} seven-week Battle of Changde, the Chinese forced Japan {{to fight a}} costly war of attrition, while {{awaiting}} Allied relief. In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German <b>forces</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history.|$|E
5|$|In late June, Russian {{military}} expert Pavel Felgenhauer predicted that Vladimir Putin would start {{a war against}} Georgia in Abkhazia and South Ossetia supposedly in August.

5|$|Most Polish historians {{agree that}} the Polish {{capitulation}} was a mistake both from the military perspective, and the political one.

5|$|The War of the First Coalition (1792–1797) was {{the first}} major effort of {{multiple}} European monarchies to defeat Revolutionary France. France declared war on Austria in April 1792, and the Kingdom of Prussia joined the Austrian side a few weeks later. France was attacked by Prussian and Holy Roman <b>forces</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Austrian Netherlands. Though the French defeated the Austrian army in the Battle of Jemappes in 1792 and briefly occupied the Austrian Netherlands and Liège, they were pushed out by an Austrian counterattack in the Battle of Neerwinden the following year.

The French government voted to formally annex the territory in October 1795 and it was split into nine provincial départements within France. French rule in the region, known as the French period (Franse tijd or période française), was marked by the rapid implementation and extension of numerous reforms which had been passed in post-Revolution France since 1789. Administration was organised under the French model, with meritocratic selection. Legal equality and state secularism were also introduced.|$|E
