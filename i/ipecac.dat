5|$|Inducing {{vomiting}} with syrup of <b>ipecac</b> has {{no role in}} paracetamol overdose {{because the}} vomiting it induces delays the effective administration of activated charcoal and oral acetylcysteine. Liver injury is extremely rare after acute accidental ingestion in children under 6 years of age. Children with accidental exposures do not require gastrointestinal decontamination with either gastric lavage, activated charcoal, or syrup of <b>ipecac.</b>|$|E
5|$|Crime and Dissonance was {{released}} on October18, 2005, through the <b>Ipecac</b> Recordings label, although it has previously been scheduled for release on September6 of the same year.|$|E
5|$|Laborintus II was {{released}} on July10, 2012, through Patton's record label <b>Ipecac</b> Recordings. In the United States, the album debuted on the Billboard Classic Albums chart at number23; it spent one week on the chart.|$|E

The album was released on both compact disc and vinyl record. The album's cover feature a die-cut design based on poster artwork created to advertise {{one of the early}} Mondo Cane concerts.|$|E
5|$|Crime and Dissonance is a 2005 {{compilation}} {{album of}} Italian composer Ennio Morricone's film score work. Intended as {{a follow-up to}} two earlier Morricone compilations assembled by Dagored, the album was put together by Alan Bishop and released by <b>Ipecac</b> Recordings. Crime and Dissonance features work ranging from the later 1960s to the early 1980s, and contains scores taken from films of several different genres.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{attention}} should be sought in cases of suspected poisoning. If the delay between ingestion and treatment is less than four hours, activated charcoal is given. Gastric lavage can be considered if the patient presents within one hour of ingestion. Inducing vomiting with syrup of <b>ipecac</b> is no longer recommended in any poisoning situations.|$|E
5|$|Mit Gas is {{the second}} studio album by the musical {{supergroup}} Tomahawk. It was released on May 6, 2003, through <b>Ipecac</b> Recordings, the record label owned by vocalist Mike Patton.

5|$|Released on May 4, 2010, through Patton's {{record label}} <b>Ipecac</b> Recordings, Mondo Cane has been met with {{favorable}} responses from music critics. Reviewers have drawn comparisons to California, an earlier album by Patton's first group Mr. Bungle. Mondo Cane peaked at number 2 in the United States' Classical Albums chart, briefly charting in Switzerland and Finland as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} {{focuses on}} Morricone's lesser-known soundtrack work, with <b>Ipecac</b> founder Mike Patton consciously wishing to distance it from similar compilations. Released on October18, 2005, Crime and Dissonance has been met with favorable reviews by critics. The album has attracted comments on Morricone's experimental and innovative compositional style, often {{in contrast to}} the spare-sounding westerns he is known for.|$|E
5|$|Wavering Radiant is {{the fifth}} and final {{full-length}} album by American post-metal group Isis, released by <b>Ipecac</b> Recordings in 2009 and produced by Joe Barresi. It stands as Isis' last full-length album, as the band split {{just over a year}} after its release. The album continues Isis' history of lengthy songwriting, yet presents a slight departure from the soft-loud dynamics and post-metal aesthetic which characterized previous releases.|$|E
5|$|Oddfellows was {{released}} on January 29, 2013 through <b>Ipecac</b> Recordings, the label owned by Patton. The album had been completed for several months by this point, but its release date was moved back as the band's members {{did not have time}} to promote an earlier release. To support the album's release, the band played at the Voodoo Experience music festival in New Orleans, Louisiana in October 2012; and the Austin, Texas Fun Fun Fun Fest, along with several tour dates in the United States in October and November.|$|E
5|$|Crime and Dissonance, a {{collection}} of Ennio Morricone's film scores from the 1970s, was conceived as a follow-up to Dagored releases Morricone 2000 and Morricone 2001. However, that label abandoned the project, and Mike Patton of <b>Ipecac</b> Recordings decided to release it instead. Morricone had no input in the project; instead the track listing was assembled by Alan Bishop. Bishop had previously assembled the Morricone 2000 and Morricone 2001 collections as well. All three compilations cover a roughly coterminous time period, spanning the late 1960s to the early 1980s, but concentrating primarily on the early 1970s. Bishop {{had been given a}} list of films whose scores were available to use in the collection; he set about compiling the two-disc set from there. However, the final song on the album, an eleven-minute section from the soundtrack to Un uomo da rispettare, {{was not included in the}} list of available material. The project was delayed for some time while Bishop waited for record label Sugar Music to license the song.|$|E
25|$|Camp <b>Ipecac</b> {{was built}} in 1939 by the Resettlement Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. It houses 92 campers in ten cabins. It is named for the Carolina <b>ipecac,</b> a herb that is used in {{traditional}} medicine. Camp Loblolly Bay {{was built in}} 1984 and houses 48 campers. It is more modern than Camp <b>Ipecac</b> and is open year round. Camp <b>Ipecac</b> opens in April and closes in October. Both camps include a mess hall and restrooms. Recreational facilities at the camps include outdoor basketball courts, a beach volleyball court and horseshoes. Charcoal grills {{are available in the}} picnic area with picnic tables.|$|E
25|$|For the SGNL›05 EP, they {{contacted}} Justin Broadrick (then of Godflesh) {{through their}} friends in Neurosis to remix {{the title track}} from Celestial, which they used as the EP's closer. Following SGNL›05, the band felt a need to expand its ambit, both artistically {{and in terms of}} distributive reach. The entire band were avid fans of Melvins, so their label – Mike Patton's <b>Ipecac</b> Recordings – was instantly put forward as an ideal candidate. Turner's friend James Plotkin was already working with <b>Ipecac,</b> so he showed some material to Patton, who, unknown to the band, was already a fan. After discussion, they signed with <b>Ipecac,</b> who went on to issue the band's subsequent studio albums.|$|E
25|$|Emesis (i.e. {{induced by}} <b>ipecac)</b> {{is no longer}} {{recommended}} in poisoning situations, because vomiting is ineffective at removing poisons.|$|E
25|$|In the Absence of Truth is {{the fourth}} {{full-length}} studio album by Los Angeles, California-based post-metal band ISIS, released by <b>Ipecac</b> Recordings on 31 October 2006. Vinyl release was handled by Conspiracy Records.|$|E
25|$|Purging: May use laxatives, diet pills, <b>ipecac</b> syrup, {{or water}} pills to flush food {{out of their}} system after eating or may engage in {{self-induced}} vomiting though {{this is a more}} common symptom of bulimia.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of a {{recently}} ingested poison may involve gastric decontamination to decrease absorption. Gastric decontamination can involve activated charcoal, gastric lavage, whole bowel irrigation, or nasogastric aspiration. Routine use of emetics (syrup of <b>Ipecac),</b> cathartics or laxatives {{are no longer}} recommended.|$|E
25|$|Patton's Peeping Tom {{album was}} {{released}} on May 30, 2006 on his own <b>Ipecac</b> label. The set was pieced together by swapping song files through the mail with collaborators like Dan the Automator, Rahzel, Norah Jones, Kool Keith, Massive Attack, Odd Nosdam, Jel, Doseone, Bebel Gilberto, Kid Koala, and Dub Trio.|$|E
25|$|Singletary Lake State Park {{is unique}} among North Carolina state parks. It is used {{primarily}} by private {{groups that have}} made arrangements to camp at Camp <b>Ipecac</b> or Camp Loblolly Bay, the two group camping facilities at the park. Visitors to the park are permitted access when the camp facilities are not in use.|$|E
25|$|Singletary Lake State Park was {{established}} in 1939 when management of the park was transferred {{from the federal government}} to the state government. The cabins built by the CCC became Camp <b>Ipecac</b> which is still in use by large groups like the Boy Scouts of America and 4-H. The park became state property in 1954.|$|E
25|$|Activated {{charcoal}} {{is recommended}} {{if it can}} be given within an hour or two of taking the calcium channel blockers. In those who have taken an extended release formulation of a CCB but are otherwise doing fine, whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol may be useful. Causing vomiting by the use of medications such as <b>ipecac</b> is not recommended.|$|E
25|$|Specific antidotes are {{available}} for certain overdoses. For example, Naloxone is the antidote for opiates such as heroin or morphine. Similarly, benzodiazepine overdoses may be effectively reversed with flumazenil. As a nonspecific antidote, activated charcoal is frequently recommended if available within one hour of the ingestion and the ingestion is significant. Gastric lavage, syrup of <b>ipecac,</b> and whole bowel irrigation are rarely used.|$|E
25|$|On May 4, 2010 Mondo Cane, where Patton worked {{live with}} a 30-piece orchestra, was {{released}} by <b>Ipecac</b> Recordings. The album was co-produced and arranged by Daniele Luppi. Recorded at a series of European performances including an outdoor concert in a Northern Italian piazza, the CD features traditional Italian pop songs {{as well as a}} rendition of Ennio Morricone's 'Deep Down'.|$|E
25|$|Initially, gastric {{decontamination}} of {{the patient}} is achieved by administering, either orally or via a nasogastric tube, activated charcoal pre-mixed with water, which adsorbs the drug in the gastrointestinal tract (most useful if given within 2 hours of drug ingestion). Other decontamination methods such as stomach pumps, gastric lavage, whole bowel irrigation, or (<b>ipecac</b> induced) emesis, are not recommended in TCA poisoning.|$|E
25|$|When Faith No More {{broke up}} in 1998 Mike Patton created the record label <b>Ipecac</b> Recordings, {{returned}} to work with his other band Mr. Bungle, and formed the experimental metal supergroup Fantômas with Buzz Osborne of the Melvins and Dave Lombardo of Slayer. Patton met Duane Denison in 1999 at a Mr. Bungle concert in Nashville and the two began exchanging music and jamming.|$|E
25|$|Clearing the Eye, the band's only DVD, documenting {{performances}} {{over the}} past five years throughout the world, was released by <b>Ipecac</b> on 26 September 2006. Also in September 2006, a collaboration with Aereogramme entitled In the Fishtank 14 was released as part of a project of Dutch label Konkurrent in which two artists are given two days' studio time to write and record their work.|$|E
25|$|The band's third album, Anonymous, was {{released}} on June 19, 2007 through <b>Ipecac</b> Recordings. Kevin Rutmanis left the band during the recording; reasons for his departure are unknown. For the album, Denison and Stanier recorded their parts in Nashville, and then sent their finished product to San Francisco where Patton added his vocals and samples. No live shows were performed during this period. Tomahawk remained inactive from 2008 to 2011.|$|E
25|$|Panopticon is {{the third}} {{full-length}} album by Los Angeles, California based post-metal band ISIS, released by <b>Ipecac</b> Recordings in 2004. The album's title is derived from philosopher Jeremy Bentham's panopticon prison ideal and philosopher/historian Michel Foucault's later allegorical appropriation of the concept. The liner notes also include quotes from technology writer Howard Rheingold and futurist Alex Steffen; as a concept album, Panopticons {{focus is on the}} proliferation of surveillance technologies throughout modern society and the government's role in that spread.|$|E
25|$|Sugar beet is an {{important}} source of sugar. Yam roots are a source of estrogen compounds used in birth control pills. The fish poison and insecticide rotenone is obtained from roots of Lonchocarpus spp. Important medicines from roots are ginseng, aconite, <b>ipecac,</b> gentian and reserpine. Several legumes that have nitrogen-fixing root nodules are used as green manure crops, which provide nitrogen fertilizer for other crops when plowed under. Specialized bald cypress roots, termed knees, are sold as souvenirs, lamp bases and carved into folk art. Native Americans used the flexible roots of white spruce for basketry.|$|E
25|$|Gillenia (syn. Porteranthus) is a genus of {{two species}} of {{perennial}} herbs in the Rosaceae family. Common names for plants in this genus include: Bowman's root, Indian-physic, American <b>ipecac.</b> This genus is endemic to dry open woods with acidic soils in eastern North America. Both plants are subshrubs with exposed semi-woody branches and serrated leaves; the larger lower leaves are divided into palmately arranged leaflets. Plants bloom in May, June, or July; blooms are composed of five slender white petals which are loosely arranged and typically appear slightly twisted and limp {{as if they were}} wilted. The flowers mature into small capsules. These plants are often planted as ornamentals and used in herbal medicine.|$|E
25|$|After the {{dissolution}} of Mr. Bungle, the members {{have gone on to}} numerous different projects. Mike Patton co-founded the record label <b>Ipecac</b> Recordings and is involved with several other ventures, including various works with composer John Zorn, and most notably the bands Fantômas, Tomahawk, and Peeping Tom. In 2004, he was called upon by Icelandic singer/songwriter Björk to provide vocal work on her album Medúlla. He acted in the motion picture Firecracker, narrated the film Bunraku, and did voice work in the movie I Am Legend, performing the infected creatures screams and howls. He also did zombie and other character voices in the game Left 4 Dead (as well as the growls for the anger core in the game Portal). Additionally, in 2009 and 2010 Patton embarked on a world tour with Faith No More after they reunited. Trey Spruance is involved with various bands, including Secret Chiefs 3 and Faxed Head. Trevor Dunn joined Patton in Fantômas and recently in Tomahawk as well as forming his own jazz band, Trevor Dunn's Trio Convulsant; he also occasionally played bass with Secret Chiefs 3. Danny Heifetz's projects included playing with Secret Chiefs 3 and in a country/punk band called Dieselhed; he now resides in Sydney, Australia, and plays in outfits such as The Exiles, The Tango Saloon and The Fantastic Terrific Munkle. Clinton McKinnon also played with Secret Chiefs 3; he now lives in Melbourne, Australia, and plays with The Ribbon Device and Umläut.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} by <b>Ipecac</b> Recordings on limited vinyl on 21 April 2009, and in CD format on 5 May. European distribution was undertaken by Conspiracy Records, [...] while a special Japanese edition was handled by Daymare Recordings.|$|E
500|$|Patton, {{founder of}} <b>Ipecac</b> Recordings, has {{described}} {{his admiration for}} Morricone's writing, feeling that the composer turned [...] "what could be banal, surface-style pop into really deep, orchestrated, tense and compelling music". Patton considers Morricone {{to be one of}} his favorite composers, and wanted the compilation to serve as a fitting tribute. He felt it was [...] "imperative" [...] for Crime and Dissonance to focus on Morricone's lesser-known work, as it had to compete with a large back catalogue of similar compilations. To this end, Patton and Bishop focused on Morricone's more experimental work, which Patton has compared to the music of Brazilian tropicália group Os Mutantes. Patton has praised Bishop's work on the project, calling him [...] "a big Morricone scholar", and has described Crime and Dissonance as one the <b>Ipecac</b> releases he is most proud of.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on January 29, 2013 through the record label <b>Ipecac</b> Recordings. The release of Oddfellows was preceded by a single, [...] "Stone Letter", first released on November 23, 2012 as part of Record Store Day's [...] "Black Friday" [...] event. Reviews for Oddfellows have been positive, and Dunn's presence has been seen by critics as a positive addition. The album reached chart positions in several countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium and the United States.|$|E
