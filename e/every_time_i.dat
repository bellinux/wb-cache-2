5|$|In November and December, {{the band}} {{returned}} to the United States where they supported <b>Every</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> Die with Code Orange Kids.|$|E
5|$|It was {{released}} on 5 September 2005 as the second single from X and has reached number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. The song reached number 18 in the United States Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks. Promo singles were released for the UK and US. Blythe Danner, the mother of Gwyneth Paltrow and former mother-in-law of Chris Martin, stated {{in an interview in}} May 2012 that Martin 'wrote the song for Gwyneth when her father died and I weep <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> hear it'.|$|E
5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought {{it was time for me}} to have my own.|$|E
3000|$|... (Just {{got some}} {{medicine}} for allergic rhinitis from the hospital, {{have to take}} some <b>every</b> <b>time</b> when <b>I</b> go back to China.) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "One--two," [...] he began. [...] "Why, I can't make it {{more than}} three times in ten years. But <b>I</b> can {{remember}} <b>every</b> <b>time</b> that <b>I</b> ever saw Mrs. B." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{shut my eyes}} once {{or twice}} and tried to persuade myself {{that the whole thing}} was a delusion, but <b>every</b> <b>time</b> that <b>I</b> opened them there was the man still {{regarding}} me with the same stony, menacing stare.|$|R
5|$|Medina and Carter {{left the}} band soon after; they were {{replaced}} by Brian Khounvichit and Mark Nicks respectively. Carter went on to form the progressive death metal band, Deus Invictus. Nicks was later replaced by drummer Jake Ryan. In September 2005, The Chariot began a 27-city tour at Poughkeepsie, New York with High on Fire, <b>Every</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> Die, and The Red Chord. An EP, titled Unsung, was released {{at the beginning of}} December. It featured two new tracks and four re-recordings from their debut and was well received among critics. The band played shows with labelmates As Cities Burn, mewithoutYou, and Underoath later that month. Touring continued through 2006 as the band shared a national tour with P.O.D. in spring and garnered a spot in the Sounds of the Underground Tour with As I Lay Dying that summer. In June 2006, Beiser and Harbin stepped down and {{were replaced by}} bassist Dan Eaton and guitarist Jon Terry respectively. The two men had been longtime friends of the band.|$|E
25|$|The band {{joined with}} Killswitch Engage, Dead by April, <b>Every</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> Die and Maylene and the Sons of Disaster for the UK {{leg of the}} Taste of Chaos 2009 tour in November 2009.|$|E
25|$|I'm very sentimental and {{the place}} gets to me <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> go there. In May I walked around and welled up with hardly anyone {{watching}} me. St Andrews was always where I wanted to finish my major career.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did he?" [...] asked Fulkerson, with {{unbroken}} cheerfulness. [...] "The {{old man is}} business, <b>every</b> <b>time.</b> Well, <b>I</b> {{suppose you}} can easily get somebody else to do Lindau's work for you. This town is just running over with half-starved linguists. What did you say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, <b>every</b> <b>time</b> that <b>I</b> want to {{come and}} see my grandfather," [...] replied Cyrus, [...] "this teazing man always stops me, and will not let me come in. I wish, grandfather, you would let me have the rule over him just for three days." ...|$|R
6000|$|I saw sick envy on Bat's face. 'Curse Nature,' he muttered. 'She gets {{ahead of}} you <b>every</b> <b>time.</b> To think <b>I</b> forgot hymns and a harmonium!' ...|$|R
25|$|Last Night in Town is {{the debut}} studio album by American metalcore band <b>Every</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> Die. After {{recording}} a demo, the band signed with independent label Goodfellow Records in 2000 and released The Burial Plot Bidding War EP. The band signed to Ferret Music in mid-2000 and {{were planning to}} record their debut album later in the year. After the writing process was done in December of that year, the band went on several US tours until March 2001. The band spent March and April recording Last Night in Town with Killswitch Engage guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz at Zing Studios in Westfield, Massachusetts. Following recording, the band went on tour with Killswitch Engage and Santa Sangre.|$|E
500|$|The {{tributes to}} Stengel upon his death were many. Maury Allen wrote, [...] "He {{is gone and}} I am {{supposed}} to cry, but I laugh. <b>Every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> saw the man, <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> heard his voice, every time his name was mentioned, the creases in my mouth would give way and a smile would come to my face." [...] Richie Ashburn, {{a member of the}} 1962 Mets, stated, [...] "Don't shed any tears for Casey. He wouldn't want you to... He was the happiest man I've ever seen." [...] Jim Murray of the Los Angeles Times [...] wrote, [...] "God is certainly getting an earful tonight." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Booze Cruise" [...] {{featured}} {{the third and}} final appearance of Katy, portrayed by Amy Adams. Adams thoroughly enjoyed her work on the show. In an interview with Advocate.com, she said, [...] " [...] was the best work experience. I loved that show and that cast so much. I don’t know if they believe me, but <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> see them I’m like, 'Oh my gosh, I’ll do anything to come back.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon that hollow {{could take}} care of any casual nat'rel fire that came boomin' along, and go two better <b>every</b> <b>time!</b> Why, <b>I</b> don't believe there was any fire; it was all a piece of that infernal ignis fatuus phantasmagoriana that was played upon us down there!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why do {{you want}} to do that at this {{particular}} <b>time,</b> when at <b>every</b> previous <b>time</b> that <b>I</b> have proposed it you have refused?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{get a new}} one <b>every</b> <b>time</b> I'm stolen. <b>I</b> used to have {{an honest}} name, but that was early; I've {{forgotten}} it. Since then I've had thirteen aliases." ...|$|R
500|$|Homer Rodeheaver {{said that}} [...] "One of these sermons, until he {{tempered}} {{it down a}} little, had one ten-minute period in it where from two to twelve men fainted {{and had to be}} carried out <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> heard him preach it." [...] Some religious and social leaders criticized Sunday's exaggerated gestures as well as the slang and colloquialisms that filled his sermons, but audiences clearly enjoyed them.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Lauryn Hill met Rohan Marley while touring as {{a member}} of the Fugees. The two {{gradually}} formed a close relationship, and while on tour, Hill became pregnant with his child. The pregnancy and other circumstances in her life inspired her to record a solo album. After contributing to fellow Fugees member Wyclef Jean's 1997 solo record The Carnival, Hill took time off from touring and recording due to her pregnancy and cases of writer's block. This pregnancy, however, renewed Hill's creativity, as she recalled in an interview several years later: [...] "When some women are pregnant, their hair and their nails grow, but for me it was my mind and ability to create. I had the desire to write in a capacity that I hadn't done in a while. I don't know if it's a hormonal or emotional thing... I was very in touch with my feelings at the time." [...] Of the early writing process, Hill said, [...] "Every time I got hurt, <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was disappointed, <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> learned, I just wrote a song." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Oh god, {{what have}} I done? What have I created? Is that me, {{or is this}} me, this small person {{standing}} down here on the stage? That's why I call the tour 'Who's That Girl?'; because I {{play a lot of}} characters, and <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> do a video or a song, people go, 'Oh, that's what she's like.' And I'm not like any of them. I'm all of them. I'm none of them. You know what I mean.?" ...|$|E
3000|$|I {{choose the}} {{one guy who}} {{returned}} $ 0.00 to me <b>every</b> single <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> knew he was out for himself; having him on my “team” meant having my “worst enemy” {{in a position where}} he wasn’t directly “against” me, and I’d know what he was up to.-Subject 31 [...]...|$|R
40|$|You {{know for}} a right-leaning person, you are {{surprisingly}} nice”. If I had been given one euro for <b>every</b> single <b>time</b> <b>I</b> heard this sentence, today I {{would probably be a}} billionaire. I am French. I am nineteen. I am right-leaning. And this simple fact has caused me many problems, created me many enemies amongst my peers, and sometimes lost me friends...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{perfectly}} correct so far, {{except that}} he hasn't produced the dollar yet," [...] Thorne assented. [...] "I should {{like to point out}} that I can cure the kind of sourness he said it was <b>every</b> <b>time,</b> but <b>I</b> can't do very much when the trouble's in the man's sour nature. You took that stuff I gave you the day you got it, Custer?" ...|$|R
500|$|I {{finally got}} tired of making movies where all I did was walk across the screen and look pretty. I got a big chance to do some real acting in The Postman Always Rings Twice, and I'm not going to slip back if I can help it. I tried to persuade the studio to give me {{something}} different. But <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> went into my argument about how bad a picture was, they'd say, [...] "well, it's making a fortune". That licked me.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the death}} of Nirvana {{frontman}} Kurt Cobain in April 1994, drummer Dave Grohl entered a state of depression, and {{found it difficult to}} both listen to music and play instruments. He was uncertain of what to do next, even considering abandoning his musical career despite a few invitations by bands such as Danzig or Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers to become their drummer, because [...] "it would just remind me of being in Nirvana; <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> sat down at a drum set, I would think of that." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{was elected}} to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001 along with Ron Yary, Lynn Swann, Jackie Slater, Mike Munchak, Marv Levy, and Nick Buoniconti and {{inducted}} in August in Canton, Ohio. Youngblood echoed his post-retirement sentiments in his Hall of Fame acceptance speech by stating, [...] "I didn't sack the quarterback <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> rushed the passer. [...] I didn't make every tackle for a loss. [...] I guess — no one could. [...] But, it wasn't because I didn't have the passion to, the desire to. [...] I hope that showed".|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} did," [...] the {{fisherman}} replied. [...] "Still {{it does seem}} strange without you. <b>Every</b> <b>time</b> as <b>I</b> goes out I says to Bill if Master Conway was at home he would be with us to-day, Bill. It don't seem no ways natural without him.' And there's been good fishing, too, this season, first rate; and the weather has been just what it should be." ...|$|R
5000|$|P. G. Wodehouse said of Boothroyd, [...] "There {{are very}} few humorists you can rely on to be funny <b>every</b> <b>time.</b> In fact <b>I</b> can think of only one. He is a writer of whom I never miss a word." ...|$|R
60|$|I turned about. Miss Croyden was {{standing}} behind me. She had, so I argued, removed her stockings and {{was standing}} in her bare feet. There is something, I am free to confess, about {{a woman in her}} bare feet which hits me where I live. With instinctive feminine taste the girl had twined a piece of seaweed in her hair. Seaweed, as a rule, gets me <b>every</b> <b>time.</b> But <b>I</b> checked myself.|$|R
500|$|Jacques René Zammit of The Malta Independent {{reviewed}} {{one episode}} in which Fry {{talked about the}} problems within journalism. Zammit wrote positively on Fry's comments saying, [...] "I share Stephen's worries completely. <b>Every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> sit down to type my excessively long column, I am burdened {{by the thought that}} after all this is just a collection of thoughts by someone who may very well be perceived as a pompous ass – and if Stephen Fry has these disquisitions, then I definitely should be doing some worrying myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Promoting The Truth, {{the band}} opened 2006 with US dates {{throughout}} February and March backed by <b>Every</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> Die, Between the Buried and Me and Haste the Day. The band also {{put in a}} significant appearance on the second stage at the Tool, Guns N' Roses and Metallica headlined Download Festival in Castle Donington, UK on June 9. On July 18, Bleeding Through appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Stand-up comedian Mitch Fatel joined the band for a song, Brandan Schieppati called this [...] "surreal {{in the best possible}} way".|$|E
500|$|When {{talking about}} the album's theme, Ciara said it was universal, stating, [...] "It's about everybody. You'll have songs with {{different}} emotions, happy, sad, 'my heart is broken.' What everybody goes through." [...] On her success with the preluding title track, Ciara said, [...] "I'm very content right now. I take everything a day at a time. <b>Every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> hear good news, I'm shouting out, 'Praise God.' Everybody around me is so excited, I still haven't got it. I haven't really felt it like they're feeling it for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} of The Art of Angel Sanctuary 2: Lost Angel, A.E. Sparrow of IGN praised the artbook, {{describing}} it as [...] "more of an encyclopedia or compendium for the series". He complimented the artwork, stating,"I was absolutely blown away with each turn of the page, figuring it couldn't get any more brilliant, and was proven wrong <b>every</b> <b>time.</b> If <b>I</b> had any complaint, {{it would be that}} the artwork doesn't go on long enough." [...] McNeil shared his views, greatly enjoying the artwork.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2016 Helmut Ditsch {{began to}} use his {{creative}} talent in music and recorded his first album [...] "Del Final de los Tiempos". The work of the artist includes music, lyrics, arrangement and voice. He also conducts an orchestra while playing the piano. Helmut Ditsch argues that his symphonic poems are the melody which {{you can also find}} on canvas. “I conceive my paintings through music. In fact the colours have a tonal frequency. Therefore <b>every</b> <b>time</b> when <b>I</b> paint, I create a music score.’’ ...|$|R
