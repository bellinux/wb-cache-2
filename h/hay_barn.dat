5|$|Building {{practices}} {{along the}} coast also included boathouses, fishing cottages, piers, etc. Here, houses for livestock and people were typically built up from the actual shoreline. A typical medium-sized farm in the inland of Norway would include a dwelling house (våningshus), <b>hay</b> <b>barn</b> (låve), livestock barn (fjøs), one or more food storage houses (stabbur), a stable, and occasionally separate houses for poultry, pigs, etc. Houses that had separate heat sources, e.g., washing houses (eldhus) and smithies were usually kept separate from the other houses to prevent fires. Outhouses were typically separate, small structures. If the farm housed craftsmen, there would also be separate houses for carpentry, wheel making, shoemaking, etc.|$|E
5|$|Wind gusts {{in central}} Maryland peaked at 83mph (134km/h) in Silver Spring, with a {{location}} along the Patuxent River recording sustained winds of 55mph (88km/h). Unofficially, rainfall reached 7inches (178mm) in portions of Maryland, though the highest precipitation amount totaled 3.21inches (82mm) at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Swells from the hurricane produced high storm surges along the Western Shore which peaked at 8.2feet (2.5m) in Baltimore. Annapolis also reported {{a surge of}} 7.2feet (2.2m). In many locations, the storm surge was higher than the previous record set by the 1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane. Throughout central Maryland, 472buildings and homes were destroyed, with 3,260 greatly damaged and another 3,600 affected in general. Strong storm surge from the hurricane washed 43,000tons (39,000 t) of salt, millions of pounds of nitrogen and phosphorus, and {{millions of gallons of}} raw sewage into the Chesapeake Bay. One person {{died as a result of}} a traffic death in the state. Property damage totaled $530.5million (2003USD, ($ USD), with an additional $190,000 (2003USD, ($ USD) in crop damage. The crop damage was primarily limited to minor damage to livestock buildings and sheds, though the winds destroyed a <b>hay</b> <b>barn</b> and a dairy barn at one farm in Frederick County. The United States Department of Agriculture estimated the winds of the hurricane destroyed 15–30% of the field corn and 10–15% of the soybean crop. Excess amounts of water led to the closure of many crab processing plants and crab house restaurants, and officials restricted harvest on shellfish for eleven days due to unsafe impurities in the water.|$|E
25|$|Around {{this time}} the Nor’Westers at Fort William began burning their records in the kitchen {{fireplace}} to prevent Selkirk from discovering any information about the company’s trading tactics. At 3 pm, two of Selkirk’s officers, McNabb and McPherson {{and a number of}} armed soldiers approached the gates of Fort William and asked for permission to enter, presumably to negotiate with the NWC partners. However, as soon as the gates opened, a bugle was blown as a signal and the soldiers rushed through the gates and spread out throughout the fort. The NWC partner Hugh McGillis shouted for his voyageurs to take up arms, but they refused. Selkirk’s men soon had two of the fort’s cannons placed in the centre of the courtyard and guards spread through the fort. It is unknown whether Selkirk had actually planned to capture and occupy Fort William or if this plot was hatched by his subordinates, but Fort William was now firmly in his hands. The next day Lord Selkirk entered the fort, took a tour and received an official protest from the NWC partners. The Nor’Westers planned to retake the fort and hid 83 loaded fusils and a barrel of gunpowder from the fort’s magazine in a <b>hay</b> <b>barn,</b> but a NWC voyageur informed Selkirk of the cache and it was quickly confiscated, preventing any possible takeover. Selkirk’s men also confiscated eight kegs of gunpowder and four cases of trade guns that were ready to be loaded onto canoes with other trade goods heading into the interior. Many of these confiscated guns were issued to Selkirk’s men. The NWC would later sue Selkirk for the theft of these goods.|$|E

500|$|Tropical Storm Bill dropped light {{rainfall}} {{of around}} [...] in northeastern Arkansas and southeastern Missouri, and over [...] in isolated parts of eastern Tennessee. The storm also produced moderate rainfall in northwestern Georgia, which peaked at [...] in Monroe. Areas in southeastern Georgia received generally around some coastal areas {{did not receive}} any precipitation from the storm. Rainfall resulted in flooding in numerous locations around the Atlanta metropolitan area, leaving some roads impassable or closed. The combination of moist air from the south, cool temperatures from a cold front to the north, and low pressures {{led to the development}} of supercells throughout Georgia and South Carolina, several of which produced tornadoes. An F1 tornado touched down [...] north-northeast of Pennington; first it passed through a farm, causing severe damage to two dairy sheds, a John Deere tractor, and three metal storage buildings. The tornado destroyed a <b>hay</b> <b>barn,</b> a carport, and a car inside the carport as well, while also causing a tree to fall and kill one cow. The tornado passed through a forested area, where it toppled or sheared off hundreds of trees. As it entered a more urban area, it downed 30isolated trees, some of which fell on a portion of Interstate 20, temporarily closing the roadway. The tornado damaged seven houses, primarily to roof damage, although one experienced damage to several windows, while another had a utility trailer and a car damaged by fallen trees; a commercial building was damaged as well. An F2 tornado was reported in Clito, which knocked down trees and damaged mobile homes. Severe thunderstorms from the remnants of Bill caused considerable damage to a house near Louisville and knocked down several trees. Moreover, a tornado was briefly associated with the storms. Bill also caused thunderstorms in Kite which uprooted several trees onto a car and a house. One man in Atlanta died due to a falling tree. Damage in Georgia totaled to $244,500 (2003USD, $ USD).|$|E
