Speaking on her choice to use the language, Rihanna commented, [...] "Sometimes the ones who have sight are the blindest." [...] During the cover's designing stage, Rihanna met with Mitchell, in which they [...] "drank" [...] {{and came up with a}} poem that would be used for the artwork and liner notes entitled If They Let Us. Mitchell explained the poem and its meaning to Rolling Stone magazine, stating it was about being misunderstood, but still be able to stand out while doing what <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> She further said that the poem speaks about not conforming to society and being a leader as well as accepting that being misunderstood is a positive thing.|$|E

Then by-and-by we can build good houses and have plenty to eat. This <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> have destroyed our game--and you will not let us go to the mountains to hunt.

[...] "Two days ago a visitor came to see him, having noticed in the paper, as you have done, the {{paragraph}} I inserted. I will not tell you her name, but {{she was one of}} the most beautiful and distinguished Englishwomen of our aristocracy, and from the manner of her departure, I could not help coming to the conclusion that the Count, by some means or other, had frightened her to death. She was nearly fainting as she came downstairs, and she has not been here since.

My dear, do {{you think}} any teacher could be worth your {{listening}} to, or anybody else's listening to, who had learned nothing, and altered his mind in nothing, from seven and twenty to seven and forty? But that second volume is very good for you {{as far as it}} goes. It is a great advance, and a thoroughly straight and swift one, to be led, as it is the main business of that second volume to lead you, from Dutch cattle pieces, and ruffian-pieces, to Fra Angelico. And it <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> also, as you grow older, to be strengthened in the general sense and judgment which may enable you to distinguish the weaknesses from the virtues of what you love: else you might come to love both alike; or even the weaknesses without the virtues. You might end by liking Overbeck and Cornelius as well as Angelico. However, I have perhaps been leaning a little too much to the merely practical side of things, in to-night's talk; and you are always to remember, children, that I do not deny, though I cannot affirm, the spiritual advantages resulting, in certain cases, from enthusiastic religious reverie, and from the other practices of saints and anchorites. The evidence respecting them has never yet been honestly collected, much less dispassionately examined: but assuredly, there is in that direction a probability, and more than a probability, of dangerous error, while there is none whatever in the practice of an active, cheerful, and benevolent life. The hope of attaining a higher religious position, which induces us to encounter, for its exalted alternative, the risk of unhealthy error, is often, as I said, founded more on pride than piety; and those who, in modest usefulness, have accepted what seemed to them here the lowliest place in the kingdom of their Father, are not, I believe, the least likely to receive hereafter the command, then unmistakable, 'Friend, go up higher.' ...|$|E

50|$|Assimilating {{employees}} into {{an organization}} {{is a critical}} role for leaders (Lambert, 2003). Commitment from the employees {{as well as the}} supervisor is equally important. In 1999, Oakes, Quartz, Ryan, and Lipton stated, and it still holds true today, that unless there is commitment by those involved in change and growth, reigning behaviors will return. Self-mentors are devoted and passionate in sustaining their success. A sense of accomplishment is motivational enough for them to continue their endeavor and maintain personal empowerment and self-efficacy (Bond & Hargreaves, 2014). Beckford (2012) agrees with the influence of self-mentoring to one’s position of personal power and ownership.

5000|$|... "Health selfishness" [...] is a {{term that}} can help explain the {{principles}} of intuitive eating because it includes {{the process of becoming}} clear on what food you need, owning what food you need whenever possible, and not apologizing for it. In short, it's about becoming attuned to your own sense of what <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> Furthermore, the process of intuitive eating more often than not leads to body positivity and an overwhelming acceptance of one's body, shape, and weight. Body positivity does not worry whether improved self-care results in weight loss because every body is different. Sometimes improved self-care leads to body changes and sometimes it does not. Body positivity is being your own unique self, not making changes to make yourself look like every other idealized image. Through intuitive eating, health selfishness, and body positivity, one can reach one's unique and full health potential without surrendering to society's idea of beauty or hurting themselves physically and emotionally.|$|E

5000|$|Lee {{invented the}} Hyper-View Large Format Stereo Print Viewer in 1990, {{improving}} on a viewer previously used for reviewing stereo medical X-rays and aerial stereo viewers. Both aerial stereo viewers and X-ray stereo viewers {{are similar in}} concept. The difference between the Hyper-View Large Format Stereo Viewer {{and the other two}} mentioned is that the others cannot cover a very large field of view. The Hyper-View device essentially widens the effective separation of the viewer's eyes from about 2½ inches to about 11 inches, as through two horizontal periscopes. One of the most convenient models is called the 3D Scope. Other viewers, include the Wheatstone Mini-Scope and the Adjustable 3D Prism Glasses. After building several viewers, Lee subsequently provided design specifications to Steven Berezin, of Berezin Stereo Products, a manufacturer which produces the oversized hyperviewers for sale to galleries and individual customers. Berezin has a viewer selection chart to help you decide which viewer <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> One of the main uses for which Lee envisioned was for gallery exhibitions of his own stereo prints. Lee was also interested in encouraging other [...] "fine art" [...] photographers who had never seriously considered stereo photography to begin producing creative work in this medium.|$|E
