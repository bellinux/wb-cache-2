40|$|Abstract—A robust <b>interturn</b> fault {{diagnostic}} approach {{based on}} the concept of magnetic field pendulous oscillation, which occurs in induction motors under faulty conditions, is introduced in this paper. This approach enables one to distinguish and classify an unbalanced voltage power supply and machine manufacturing/construction imperfections from an <b>interturn</b> fault. The experimental results for the two case studies of a set of 5 -hp and 2 -hp induction motors verify the validity of the proposed approach. Moreover, it can be concluded from the experimental results that if the circulating current level in the shorted loop increases beyond the phase current level, an <b>interturn</b> fault can be easily detected using the proposed approach even {{in the presence of the}} existence of motor manufacturing imperfection effects.

40|$|<b>Interturn</b> faults in {{permanent}} magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) may develop fast into more severe faults such as coil-to-coil, phase-to-phase and phase-to-ground short circuits. These faults are very destructive and may irreversibly damage the PMSM. Therefore, {{it is highly}} desirable to develop suitable methods for the early detection of such faults. The effects of <b>interturn</b> faults are visible in both the stator currents and the zero-sequence voltage component (ZSVC) spectra. By designing appropriate fault diagnosis schemes based on {{the analysis of the}} harmonic content of such electric variables it is possible to detect short circuit faults in its early stage.

40|$|Nowadays, stator current {{analysis}} {{used for}} detecting the incipient fault in {{squirrel cage motor}} has received much attention. However, {{in the case of}} <b>interturn</b> short circuit in stator, the traditional symmetrical component method has lost the precondition due to the harmonics and noise; the negative sequence component (NSC) is hard to be obtained accurately. For broken rotor bars, the new added fault feature blanked by fundamental component is also difficult to be discriminated in the current spectrum. To solve the above problems, a fundamental component extraction (FCE) method is proposed in this paper. On one hand, via the antisynchronous speed coordinate (ASC) transformation, NSC of extracted signals is transformed into the DC value. The amplitude of synthetic vector of NSC is used to evaluate the severity of stator fault. On the other hand, the extracted fundamental component can be filtered out to make the rotor fault feature emerge from the stator current spectrum. Experiment results indicate that this method is feasible and effective in both <b>interturn</b> short circuit and broken rotor bars fault diagnosis. Furthermore, only stator currents and voltage frequency are needed to be recorded, and this method is easy to implement...|$|E

Hence, this motor was anticipated to make a useful test bed for evaluation of the efficacy of existing and new motor fault diagnostics techniques and not the study of insulation failure mechanisms. Accordingly, it was anticipated that this reconfigurable motor would eliminate the need to permanently destroy machine components such as stator windings or rotor bars when acquiring data from a faulty machine for fault diagnostic purposes. Experimental results under healthy and various faulty conditions are presented in this paper, including issues associated with rotor bar-end ring contact resistances that showed the drawbacks of this motor in so far as emulation of rotor bar breakages.

40|$|Transformers {{connected}} at the medium-voltage {{level in}} cable grids, such as wind park collection grids and industrial grids, {{are exposed to}} the stress of very fast transients. These electric transients are mainly generated during breaker switching operations and the rise time of the transient voltage in such systems is much shorter compared to the rise times of transients generated in transmission systems at a high-voltage level. In this paper, the internal voltage stress is studied during very fast transients generated during transformer energization. Instead of using a breaker, the energizing tests are performed using a low-impedance pulse generator that can generate lightning impulse-shaped waveforms and voltage steps with rise times varying between 35 and 500 ns. Experiments show that during very fast transients with a 35 -ns rise time and 1 -p. u. magnitude, the <b>interturn</b> voltage exceeds the level obtained with a lightning impulse-shaped voltage waveform of 4. 4 pu.

40|$|The authors [1] {{presented}} an interesting method {{to extract the}} transfer function from the equivalent circuit of a two-winding trans-former. The equivalent circuit {{is based on the}} nodal conductance matrix G, nodal reciprocal inductance matrix, and nodal capacitance matrix C. So far, there were many articles published so that the transfer function of a particular transformer was extracted from the measured transformer terminal impedance. The method presented here is clear and easily applicable by making use of the powerful Matlab functions. Furthermore, one can determine the resonance frequencies of a particular transformer more accurately. To show the applicability, a lightning impulse at the transformer ter-minal is applied and a response {{at the end of the}} first pi-section (Fig. 1) is computed. These results are according to the expectations. We would appreciate an answer to the following questions: • In the particular case, it is not clearly defined whether a pi-section corresponds to a coil, a group of coils, or a turn (Fig. 2). In most cases, the transformer might suffer from steep <b>interturn</b> voltages. The authors claim that by using this method, there is no limit on the size of the network.

However, for longer time intervals (a few hundreds of microseconds), not only might the winding losses have a significant influence but also the core losses due to the flux penetration inside the core [3].

As it becomes increasingly deployed, effective condition monitoring built on reliable and accurate fault detection techniques {{is needed to}} ensure its engineering integrity. Unlike induction machine which has been rigorously investigated for faults, axial-flux permanent magnet machine has not. Thus in this thesis, axial-flux permanent magnet machine is investigated under faulty conditions. Common faults associated with it namely; static eccentricity and <b>interturn</b> short circuit are modelled, and detection techniques are established. The modelling forms a basis for; developing a platform for precise fault replication on a developed experimental test-rig, predicting and analysing fault signatures using both finite element analysis and experimental analysis. In the detection, the motor current signature analysis, vibration analysis and electrical impedance spectroscopy are applied. Attention is paid to fault-feature extraction and fault discrimination. Using both frequency and time-frequency techniques, features are tracked in the line current under steady-state and transient conditions respectively. Results obtained provide rich information on the pattern of fault harmonics. Parametric spectral estimation is also explored {{as an alternative to}} the Fourier transform in the steady-state analysis of faulty conditions. It is found to be as effective as the Fourier transform and more amenable to short signal-measurement duration. Vibration analysis is applied in the detection of eccentricities; its efficacy in fault detection is hinged on proper determination of vibratory frequencies and quantification of corresponding tones. This is achieved using analytical formulations and signal processing techniques. Furthermore, the developed fault model is used to assess the influence of cogging torque minimization techniques and rotor topologies in axial-flux permanent magnet machine on current signal in the presence of static eccentricity. The double-sided topology is found to be tolerant to the presence of static eccentricity unlike the single-sided topology due to the opposing effect of the resulting asymmetrical properties of the airgap.
