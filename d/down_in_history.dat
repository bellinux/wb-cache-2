5|$|The {{battle has}} gone <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> {{as one of}} the turning points of the War of the Spanish Succession. Bavaria was knocked out of the war, and Louis' hopes for a quick victory came to an end. France {{suffered}} over 38,000 casualties including the commander-in-chief, Marshal Tallard, who was taken captive to England. Before the 1704 campaign ended, the Allies had taken Landau, and the towns of Trier and Trarbach on the Moselle in preparation for the following year's campaign into France itself.|$|E
5|$|A {{first team}} regular {{alongside}} defensive partners Neil Aspin and Dean Glover, in summer 1992 {{he helped the}} club to win the pre-season TNT Tournament. His performances in the 1992–93 season saw him awarded {{a place on the}} PFA Second Division team. He was man of the match in the League Trophy final victory over Stockport County – despite suffering from a double hernia and being hungover from a secret boozing session the night before. The season finished on a negative note though, {{in the second half of}} the 1993 Second Division play-off final against West Bromwich Albion, with the game still goalless, Swan was sent off after bringing down Bob Taylor – who was through on goal. This proved to the turning point in the game as West Brom went on to win 3–0 to secure promotion at Vale's expense. It also meant that he went <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> as only the third Englishman to be sent off at Wembley, after Kevin Keegan and Lee Dixon.|$|E

5|$|Walsh {{identified}} drinks as {{the central}} Diageo business, and began selling off assets that did not fit this model. He sold Pillsbury to General Mills in 2001 for $10.1 billion, and Burger King to the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in 2002 for $1.5 billion. He suggested {{that he would have}} liked to have sold Burger King earlier, but was worried about Diageo's capacity to handle both transactions simultaneously. In a strategy to bolster Diageo's drinks sales, in 2001 he acquired the Seagram drinks business from Vivendi Universal in conjunction with Pernod Ricard for $8.2 billion, an action that was later credited with refocusing and re-energising Diageo. At the time, analysts suggested that Walsh had overpaid, and that Pernod Ricard had gained control of the better brands. Despite having entered into an alliance with Pernod in order to avoid regulatory issues, Diageo was still forced to divest the Malibu Rum brand after acquiring Captain Morgan. Walsh defended the deal on the basis of efficiency savings and the fact that the deal was almost entirely financed by the sale of Pillsbury. Of the acquisition he says:We moved in on that Seagram deal and forced their hand very quickly while our competitors were still trying to get their act together. If you look at what we paid it will go <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> as the bargain of the century. It was an $8.1bn total price of which our part was about $5.6bn and it was at economic profit break even at the end of year two. It’s produced phenomenal returns. If you look at Pernod’s Allied Domecq acquisition, it is 30 per cent higher in multiple terms and you’re not getting as good a collection of brands.|$|E

25|$|The first {{military}} engagements in Sri Lankan history {{were marked}} by the advent of King Vijaya, a Bengal prince who landed along with his followers on the beaches of northwestern Sri Lanka around 543 BC. Prince Vijaya and his followers occupied the lands of the native Veddah people. Repeated incursions by South Indians, particularly the Cholas, into Sri Lankan territory occurred throughout the next few centuries {{and led to the}} engagement of the rival forces in battle. In one famous encounter, Sinhalese King Dutugemunu (200 BC) raised an army of eleven thousand inhabitants in his battle against the Chola invader King Elara, whom he eventually defeated. King Dutugemunu's organisational skills, bravery and chivalry are famous and his battles have gone <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> as outstanding offensive operations.|$|E
25|$|The 17th Party Congress (26 January – 10 February 1934) {{has gone}} <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> as the Congress of Victors, {{because of the}} success of the First-Five Year Plan. During it several delegates formed an anti-Stalin bloc. Several delegates {{discussed}} the possibility of either removing or reducing Stalin's powers. Not all conflicts were below the surface, and Grigory Ordzhonikidze, the People's Commissar for Heavy Industry openly disputed with Vyacheslav Molotov, the Chairman of the Council of the People's Commissars, about the rate of economic growth. The dispute between Ordzhonikidze and Molotov, who represented the Soviet leadership, was settled by the establishment of a Congress Commission, which consisted of Stalin, Molotov, Ordzhonikidze, other Politburo members and certain economic experts. They eventually reached an agreement, and the planned target for economic growth in the Second Five-Year Plan was reduced from 19% to 16.5%.|$|E
25|$|The Pacers {{duplicated}} their 52–30 {{record in}} 1995–96, but were hurt severely by {{an injury to}} Reggie Miller's eye socket in April, from which {{he was not able}} to return until Game 5 of their first-round series against the Hawks.

This 1995–96 team did manage to go <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> as the only team to defeat the Chicago Bulls twice that year, a Bulls team which made history with a then all-time best 72–10 record. The Pacers could not withstand several key injuries in 1996–97, nor could they handle the absence of Mark Jackson, who had been traded to the Denver Nuggets before the season (though they did re-acquire Jackson at the trading deadline). The Pacers finished 39–43 and missed the playoffs for the first time in seven years, after which coach Larry Brown stepped down.|$|E

25|$|Four {{years after}} aggregation, Prime, which {{had had a}} stop/start {{approach}} to local news in Canberra, decided to take on CTC head-to-head with a one-hour local/national/international 6pm news bulletin. Prime's first attempt at news in Canberra saw the station lure CTC alumnus John Bok back from Adelaide in 1989 to produce and front a 30-minute local news bulletin. However Prime couldn't drag the audience from CTC and in April 1991 the bulletin was scaled back to a five-minute update shown {{at the end of}} Seven Nightly News from Sydney. In 1993 Prime decided to try again and a team of 26 including Ken Begg and Geoff Hiscock, both poached from CTC, were brought together to upgrade Prime's news. The now nationally known faces of Melissa Doyle and Jessica Rowe would also join Prime's news team. Meanwhile, sports presenter Greg Robson took over from Hiscock anchoring Capital Eyewitness News at CTC alongside Kininmonth and WIN maintained its half-hour local news bulletin anchored by veteran Canberra broadcaster Peter Leonard. Prime's 6 O'clock News commenced on 1 March 1993 amid a high-profile advertising campaign. For the first time since aggregation, viewers had the choice of three locally produced television 6pm news bulletins, two of which were composite local, national and international. 1993 would go <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>history</b> as the pinnacle of local TV choice for Canberra, with buses and newspapers plastered with the faces of three newsrooms. But it wasn't to last and by Christmas 1993 Prime had scaled back its one-hour composite to a half-hour local bulletin. Capital Eyewitness News prevailed as the number one news program followed by fierce rival WIN. The newscast, with the purchase of Southern Cross Broadcasting of the channel, became Ten Capital Eyewitness News in 1994, and later on as Ten News on Capital that same year, in line with the Network Ten news rebrand, moving back to 5PM after 2 years.|$|E
