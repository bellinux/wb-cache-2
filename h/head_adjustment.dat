50|$|Two metal cams, one {{stationary}} and one movable, {{are used}} to immobilize the rope. The position of the movable cam {{is controlled by the}} locking handle. When the handle is raised, the movable cam is pressed towards the stationary cam so as to grip the rope by compressing it between the cams. Conversely, the lock is released by lowering the handle, thus retracting the movable cam away from the stationary cam and releasing the grip on the rope. The position of the stationary cam can usually be adjusted with a socket <b>head</b> <b>adjustment</b> screw. This enables the spacing between the cams to be adjusted so that, when locked, the rope lock can accommodate ropes of different diameters.|$|E

40|$|Most {{autonomous}} vehicles use GPS {{to determine}} vehicle location and heading. Using GPS for vehicle autonomous driving posts a few challenges. It {{does not look}} {{far ahead of the}} vehicle and requires frequent <b>adjustment</b> of vehicle <b>heading.</b> This results in an unstable control system and increases the chance of unstable driving behavior. Unlike this kind of passive or reactive control system, human drivers look far ahead of the road to determine the road curvature and actively adjust vehicle heading and turning angle in advance. Visual information is essential to enabling this kind of human-like driving behavior for autonomous vehicles and should be an important supplement to the GPS-based system, especially in GPSdenied environments. Road lanes are often curved, making vision-based detection of smooth and continuous curves in front of the vehicle a challenging task. Furthermore, commonly used computer vision algorithms such as edge detectors or Hough transform for line or curvature detection are not robust in changing lighting conditions. This paper presents a vision algorithm designed specifically for detecting and modeling road curvature for humanlike active steering control and <b>heading</b> <b>adjustment</b> for autonomous vehicles.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundSelf-generated body {{movements}} require compensatory eye and <b>head</b> <b>adjustments</b> {{in order}} to avoid perturbation of visual information processing. Retinal image stabilization is traditionally ascribed to the transformation of visuovestibular signals into appropriate extraocular motor commands for compensatory ocular movements. During locomotion, however, intrinsic “efference copies” of the motor commands deriving from spinal central pattern generator (CPG) activity potentially offer a reliable and rapid mechanism for image stabilization, in addition to the slower contribution of movement-encoding sensory inputs. ResultsUsing a variety of in vitro and in vivo preparations of Xenopus tadpoles, we demonstrate that spinal locomotor CPG-derived efference copies do indeed produce effective conjugate eye movements that counteract oppositely directed horizontal head displacements during undulatory tail-based locomotion. The efference copy transmission, by which the extraocular motor system becomes functionally appropriated to the spinal cord, is mediated by direct ascending pathways. Although the impact of the CPG feedforward commands matches the spatiotemporal specificity of classical vestibulo-ocular responses, the two fundamentally different signals do not contribute collectively to image stabilization during swimming. Instead, when the CPG is active, horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflexes resulting from head movements are selectively suppressed. ConclusionsThese results therefore challenge our traditional understanding of how animals offset the disruptive effects of propulsive body movements on visual processing. Specifically, our finding that predictive efference copies of intrinsic, rhythmic neural signals produced by the locomotory CPG supersede, rather than supplement, reactive vestibulo-ocular reflexes {{in order to}} drive image-stabilizing eye adjustments during larval frog swimming, represents a hitherto unreported mechanism for vertebrate ocular motor control...|$|R

40|$|Various pumping {{arrangements}} and their pressure profile control for forced cooling of long pipe type transmission lines were investigated. In order {{to overcome the}} extensive friction head losses and provide ample cable cooling, a number of pump stations has to be used. Since the inner line segments cannot be provided with pressure control head tanks, line blockages, flow resistance changes, flow rate changes, pump shutdowns, or other imbalances in one segment can alter the pressure profile along the entire line, and, when two head tanks are used, create transverse flow. Using experimental and analytical methods, {{it was determined that}} the pump - relief valve combination operating as a constant flow source is superior to the pump - relief valve combination operating as a constant pressure source, and that the configuration consisting of an even number of loops, each loop having the opposite flow direction from its neighbor's, is the best solution when operated with only one pressure control head tank. The simplest, and yet effective, line pressure profile control appears to be the pump bypass, which could be easily implemented on existing installations. The <b>head</b> tank pressure <b>adjustment,</b> however, is the most effective line pressure profile control scheme, and should be considered when a new system is being designed. From the analysis performed on an electric analogy model it was found, that the <b>head</b> tank pressure <b>adjustment</b> or the pump bypass would be sufficient to mainain the line pressure profile within its working limits for all practical imbalance sizes, and that, to extend the range of either of these line pressure profile controls, the emergency pump shutdown and the pump bypass itself should be based on the pump discharge, rather than the pump inlet pressure.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceLight-emitting diodes (LEDs) {{have become}} a good {{alternative}} to traditional cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) for backlighting sources in liquid crystal displays (LCDs). LED backlighting provides a number of benefits over CCFLs, such as greater efficiency, better brightness, longer lifetime, higher dimming ratios, and lower drive circuitry voltage [1]. One application where a higher dimming ratio is desired is in aerospace cockpit LCD modules, which need to provide both high brightness for sunlight readability and also a high dimming ratio for very low brightness during nighttime operation. Two methods commonly used to dim LEDs are constant current reduction(CCR) and pulse width modulation(PWM) dimming. The downside to using CCR is the limited dimming ratio and nonlinearities in light output that occur from variations in luminous efficacy over the dimming range [2]. To obtain a high dimming ratio using PWM dimming, the LED current rise time must be sufficiently faster than the minimum PWM. This ensures {{that there will be}} no nonlinearities in the light output, which could result in visible flicker when operating at low-brightness settings. To provide higher system efficiency, a method for soft starting the LED regulator is presented. This method allows for reduced head room operation by ramping the LED current during turn-on, which results in a reduced voltage dip on the LED power supply. Finally, a method for <b>head</b> room <b>adjustment</b> that allows for adjustment of the LED supply voltage for variations in forward voltage over temperature and time is presented...|$|R

The objective of the analysis {{was to determine the}} association between head circumference and eight cognitive outcomes and to assess any potential effect modification of existing associations by Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. METHODS: Cognitive outcomes include scores from the Modified Mini-Mental State Exam (3 MS), the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), Stroop Color-Word Test, Trail-Making Test A and B, and a word-stem completion task measuring implicit memory. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each variable. Head circumference and dependent cognitive outcomes were modeled as dichotomous variables using logistic regression, adjusting for gender, age, education, income, height, and Spot The Word test score, a measure of pre-morbid IQ. For dichotomized test scores, poor outcomes (cases) were defined as having scores in the lowest quintile; the remaining top four quintiles were considered non-cases. RESULTS: small head circumference was significantly associated with low 3 MS scores [OR(95 %CI) : 2. 97 (1. 12, 7. 89), p= 0. 03], after adjustment for age, income and pre-morbid IQ.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to develop and empirically test a theoretical model of international school headship transitions {{in order to identify}} potential sources of unwanted turnover. Anecdotal evidence from the past two decades suggests that the short tenure of international school heads (average = 3. 7 years, Benson, 2011) is unwanted by international schools, a result of up to 70 % of heads either volunteering to leave their schools prematurely, being fired, or failing to have their contracts renewed. This qualitative multi-case study dissertation analyzes the experiences of twelve second-year international school heads guided by the use of a theoretical framework grounded in the literatures of leadership and governance in international schools, non-profit organizations, U. S. school districts, and charter schools {{in order to determine the}} factors that heads identify as affecting their transitions to work and life abroad. Findings from this study suggest that the headship transition process proceeds in three phases, with heads identifying specific factors affecting transition experiences at each respective phase. Organizational recruitment and selection, contract negotiation, and personal motivation affect heads during the acceptance phase, or the period between the job search and formally accepting an offered contract to become a head of school. Work transition supports (realistic job previews), relocation supports (i. e. locating housing and medical care), and work role spillover (i. e. exiting one job while preparing to entry another) impacts heads during the anticipation stage between hire and their first day on the job.

40|$|Current {{market trends}} are moving from large {{quantity}} production towards small batch production and mass customization. This {{has led to}} the high demand for the flexibility and adaptability of manufacturing technology and systems. Several reconfigurable pin type tooling systems have been proposed and developed to satisfy such demands. However, these reconfigurable tooling systems still suffer from several drawbacks, including difficulties associated with positioning and locking the pins and problems of uneven “staircase” surface effects from relying on discrete finite size pins. The main focus of this research is on building a hybrid vacuum-forming machine system (HAVES) based on reconfigurable screw-pin tooling (SPT) as a test bed for understanding the processes involved in developing this technology and to examine the feasibility of implementing such technology in an industrial system. The SPT used is composed of identical screw pins,which are engaged with each other in an array pattern. By adjusting vertical displacement of the screw pins, a wide variety of component geometry can be formed. The adjustment methodology of the SPT is formulated mathematically in order to help construction of the SPT be parametrical thus enabling automatic CNC G-code generation. The HAVES test bed development involves full machine design and hardware and software integration. The hardware integration task included a CNC controller, drive motors, encoders, milling and screw <b>adjustment</b> <b>heads,</b> SPT, vacuum forming system. The software integration task involved the processing of three-dimensional CAD geometry to automatically generate post processed G codes in order to adjust the screw-pin to the required component geometry and subsequent surface machining for driving the final die geometry and minimize operator intervention. The completed HAVES test bed has been tested for accuracy, repeatability and functionalities with quality good results. An economic analysis has been also conducted to verify the economic feasibility of the HAVES test bed by comparing the cost of making vacuum forming components using a dedicated mould versus using the HAVES test bed.

For better adjustment of the NRW demand, the network may be divided into several DMAs and NRW, and the hydraulic pattern for each DMA is worked out by installing a flow meter at the inlet of each DMA for better calibration. Hence, this calibration process assumed that the prepared data and predicted nodal demands were reasonably accurate and the model calibrated by adjusting only the pipe roughness coefficients for the group of pipes by the same amount to minimize the summation of the sum of square of difference between the measured and simulated values of the pressure heads (Eq.  4) at the observation points.

A combinação dos nove tratamentos deu-se por três condições de lastragens (0; 960 e 1. 307 kg) e três ângulos das seções (0 º; 7 º e 14 º). Os resultados evidenciaram aumento de 32, 4 % no consumo operacional (L há- 1) relacionado à maior lastragem, bem como em 26, 8 % com o maior ângulo das seções, ambos comparados à condição sem lastro e com menor ângulo, respectivamente. A profundidade de trabalho, a força de tração e a potência na barra aumentaram com o aumento do ângulo das seções e com a adição de lastros. It is been a {{great deal}} of interest the studying of the operational performance of tractors and its machinery especially in work conditions. The present study had as objective to evaluate the operational performance of an "Aerossolo" prototype tracked with a Valtra BM 100 4 x 2 TDA, with the engine power of 73. 6 kW (100 cv). The prototype equipment is a drag type, hydraulically commanded, with telescopic <b>heading</b> for longitudinal <b>adjustment,</b> two lateral sections with 28 knifes in each one of them, concrete ballasts, wheels of transport and aggregate breaker coil. The work was conducted in the Department of Agricultural Engineering of the UNESP, Jaboticabal Campus, in a randomized blocks design, factorial 3 x 3, with four repetitions. The nine studied treatments were a combination for three ballast conditions (0; 960 and 1, 307 kg) and three angles of the sections (0 º; 7 º and 14 º). The results indicate an increase in operational consumption (liters per hectare) of 32. 4 % in relation to the concrete ballast addition, and a 26. 8 % in relation to the angle variation between sections. The working depth, traction force and power demands were higher with the increases in the concrete ballast and the angle variation between sections...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis was to study the age-related {{differences}} of prospective control and object representation in young infants. The overall set of theoretical and empirical issues addressed in this thesis consists of how infants represent and react to visible and non-visible moving objects. This involves understanding the interrelationship between different actions, such as head and trunk movements, and reaching. Questions about infants’ ability to negotiate different kinds of motions {{and the notion that}} infant representation of an occluded object can be graded in strength are also addressed in the present thesis. The hypothesis of graded representation proposed that a concept of object representation is not a clear-cut distinction between whether one has a representation or not. It is rather a graded process, evolving with experience and becoming embedded in processes underlying overt behaviour. Study I showed that perturbing an object affected the quality of grasp, which seems to indicate that the approach and grasp components are, at least partially, integrated by nine months of age. The analysis of the relationship between head and hand movements showed tightness in the coupling between these movements, as indicated by a small correction time difference between them. Study III showed that 6 -month-old infants, under certain conditions, can form a dynamical representation of a moving and temporarily occluded object, taking into account the velocity and the direction of the object’s motion. It also revealed three other interesting findings: firstly, that an occluder could provide landmark information about object reappearance; secondly, that reaching was dramatically disrupted when the object was temporarily non-visible either due to occlusion or blackout of the room lights and thirdly, that reaching recovered markedly after a few trials, but only when subject to blackout. Overall, the results supported the hypothesis of graded representations. In Study IV, when infants observed a circular object motion, it was shown that while head tracking is functional in 6 -month-old infants, it continues to develop and become more refined up to, and beyond, the age of 12 months. The structural organization of head tracking in both 6 and 12 -month-old infants complied with an organizational pattern of accelerations and decelerations, or so-called movement units, which is in line with earlier studies of both goal-directed and spontaneous arm movements. The intersegmental coupling between the head and the trunk showed that the infants tried to stabilise <b>head</b> movements by <b>adjustments</b> of the trunk. In addition, study II presents a method for coding prehensile movements by means of a touch screen system, which is used in study III...|$|R
