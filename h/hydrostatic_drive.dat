50|$|Two factory {{train for}} {{renewing}} overhead line equipment on the West Coast Mainline was ordered in 1999, and delivered in 2000. Each train-consist {{was made up}} of five separable autonomous units (four of which were single-ended MPVs); the entire train is fitted for multiple working allowing self powered transportation to a work site. In operation the train-consist splits into five sub-trains: the first unit is used to dismantle and recover previously installed wire; the second unit replaces catenary support wires ("droppers"), the third and fourth units install new wire and droppers, and the fifth unit is used for quality control - measuring and recording the new installation. To allow slow speed control the MPVs were fitted with <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>drives.</b> A Windhoff MPV was also used as the basis of a piling train - used to install catenary masts.

50|$|A <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>drive</b> {{consists}} of a hydraulic pump and a hydraulic motor. Since positive displacement pumps and motors are used, one revolution of the pump or motor corresponds to a set volume of fluid flow that {{is determined by the}} displacement regardless of speed or torque. Speed is regulated by regulating the fluid flow with a valve or by changing the displacement of the pump or motor. Many different design variations have been used. A swash plate drive employs an axial piston pump and/or motor in which the swash plate angle can be changed to adjust the displacement and thus adjust the speed.|$|E

40|$|An {{improving}} dynamic {{quality of}} vehicles and enhanced fuel efficiency are gained {{thanks to the}} combined power system (CPS), comprising a main energy source - internal combustion engine (ICE) with an attained level of the power source - and an auxiliary energy source, i. e. an energy storage device (a flywheel). To solve this problem was developed a mathematical model of CPS comprising internal combustion engine and flywheel energy storage (FES) with stepless drive. The stepless drive of the flywheel is made to be hydrostatic mechanical to raise the system efficiency. To reduce the drive weight and simplify the control system in the hydraulic part of the flywheel drive is used only one hydraulic unit being controlled. The paper presents a kinematic diagram of the track-type vehicle equipped with the CPS that has a <b>hydrostatic</b> mechanical <b>drive</b> of the flywheel and a mechanical transmission. A mathematical model of the system comprising an ICE, <b>hydrostatic</b> mechanical <b>drive,</b> and FES with stepless drive has been developed. This mathematical model was used to study the influence of ICE and flywheel drive parameters on the dynamic characteristics of the system. The paper estimates the impact of flywheel energy consumption, pressure in the hydraulic system, and control parameter of <b>hydrostatic</b> mechanical <b>drive</b> on the charging time of FES. The obtained piecewise linear law to control the regulation parameter of the hydraulic unit allows us to minimize the charging time of the flywheel at the short-term stops and in the parking area of a tracked vehicle equipped with a CPS. The causes affecting the performance of ‘ICE – drive – flywheel’ system {{in the course of}} the flywheel acceleration are a restricted maximum power of the engine, as well as a limited generating capacity, and a maximum flywheel drive hydro-system pressure. The obtained results allow us to determine rational parameters of the flywheel and the laws of drive control to provide their further optimization, with a tracked vehicle being in motion, under random external effect. </p...|$|R
50|$|As in dialysis, in {{hemofiltration}} one achieves {{movement of}} solutes across a semi-permeable membrane. However, solute movement with hemofiltration {{is governed by}} convection rather than by diffusion. With hemofiltration, dialysate is not used. Instead, a positive <b>hydrostatic</b> pressure <b>drives</b> water and solutes across the filter membrane from the blood compartment to the filtrate compartment, from which it is drained. Solutes, both small and large, get dragged through the membrane at a similar rate by {{the flow of water}} that has been engendered by the hydrostatic pressure. Thus convection overcomes the reduced removal rate of larger solutes (due to their slow speed of diffusion) seen in hemodialysis.|$|R
