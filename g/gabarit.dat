50|$|The Freycinet gauge (<b>gabarit</b> Freycinet) is a {{standard}} governing {{the dimensions of the}} locks of some canals, put in place {{as a result of a}} law passed during the tenure of Charles de Freycinet as minister of public works of France, dating from 5 August 1879.The law required the size of lock chambers to be increased to a length of 39 m, a width of 5.2 m and a minimum water depth of 2.2 m, thus allowing 300 to 350 tonne barges to pass through.|$|E
50|$|Near {{the centre}} of town is a marina with {{moorings}} for about 150 boats. 2300m north {{of this is a}} floating platform where the very large Airbus A380 wings and fuselage sections are transferred from sea-going RORO ferries to barges.

In Saint-Nazaire in western France, the ship trades the fuselage sections from Hamburg for larger, assembled sections, some of which include the nose. The ship unloads in Bordeaux. Afterwards, the ship picks up the belly and tail sections by Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA in Cádiz in southern Spain, and delivers them to Bordeaux. From there, the A380 parts are transported by barge to Langon, and by the oversize road convoys of the Itinéraire à Grand <b>Gabarit</b> from there to the assembly hall in Toulouse.|$|E
50|$|The Canal Dunkerque-Escaut is a 189 km {{long series}} of {{historic}} canals, and the canalised river Escaut (Scheldt) that were substantially rebuilt from the mid-1950s up to ca. 1980, with some new sections, from Dunkerque to the Belgian border at Mortagne-du-Nord. Existing canals (listed below) were straightened and widened; and new locks (écluses) were built, also on the river Escaut, from the junction at Bouchain to the border.The route {{is also known as}} the Liaison à grand <b>gabarit</b> (large dimensions, or high capacity, literally large gauge) Dunkerque-Escaut. Some authors have separated the waterway into the canal proper and the canalised river Escaut, but current practice is to use the simple name throughout. The Liaison was designed for large commercial vessels up to 85m long by 11.50m wide (and 143m long push-tows). The entire route is being further upgraded to offer European Class Vb dimensions, for push-tows 185m by 11.50m, and motor barges up to 125m long, as part of the current EU-funded Seine-Escaut-Rhine waterway corridor investments, including the new Seine-Nord Europe Canal.|$|E
50|$|Mostyn was {{mentioned}} in the Doomsday Book of 1086. Henry Bolingbroke (later Henry IV) landed here in 1399 before attacking Richard II at Flint Castle. Coal was mined at Mostyn and Iron production started in the mid nineteenth century. The combination of a colliery, iron works and the docks made this a profitable enterprise. Nineteen hundred people were employed at one time. The coal eventually became exhausted and the ironworks closed in 1965. Between 1848 and 1966 there was a railway station in the village on the Chester to Holyhead line. Mostyn once served as a port from which ferries used to sail (until 2004) to Dublin on the Liverpool-Dublin route. Today, manufactured wings for the Airbus A380 aircraft leave Mostyn on the ship Ville de Bordeaux, after travelling down the River Dee by barge from the Airbus wing factory at Broughton, Flintshire. See Itinéraire à Grand <b>Gabarit</b> for more details of the transportation. Mostyn's port area {{is home to the}} headquarters of Warwick International Group Limited, manufacturers of bleach activators for detergent applications.|$|E
40|$|In paper it {{is shown}} that {{acceleration}} of sensors production rates requires design process automation, {{especially at the}} initial stage which main objectives are synthesis and the choice of design solutions of sensors sensitive elements {{on the basis of}} the comparative analysis of a large number of alternative options. For automated synthesis of new technical devices, it is necessary to fill in the database {{on the basis of the}} analysis of the known constructions. Based on the analysis of patent and scientific and technical literature the class of sensors for implementation of the drafted theoretical provisions is defined. These are microelectronic pressure sensors. By results of the analysis of patent and scientific and technical literature microelectronic sensors of pressure are classified by the following signs: the improved operational characteristics (precision, responsivity, constancy, reliability, functionality, <b>gabarit,</b> price) and methods of their achievement. It is established that more attention is paid to processing and materials research methods. Basic type designs of pressure microelectronic sensors are defined. The most perspective constructive methods, the required operational characteristics allowing to reach at the same time the maximum quantity and insufficiently studied directions of achievement of the required operational characteristics are revealed. The research has allowed to reveal the most perspective methods of improvement of operational characteristics of pressure microelectronic sensors. Research results are intended for formation of the database containing the formalized description of elementary objects for synthesis of new technical solutions...|$|E
40|$|U 2008. godini nastavljena su sustavna arheološko-konzervatorska istraživanja srednjovjekovnoga burga Vrbovca u Klenovcu Humskom, na istočnome dijelu lokaliteta, izvan jezgre burga te u istočnom dijelu dvorišta. Izvan jezgre burga definiran je <b>gabarit</b> prostorije, zidane istočno uz palas, istraženo je vanjsko lice istočnoga obrambenog zida burga, a nastavljena su i istraživanja manjeg zida za sada nepoznate namjene i datacije. U dvorištu su otkriveni ostaci drvenog objekta iz razdoblja ranoga novog vijeka, stradalog u požaru. The archaeological {{excavations}} of 2008 encompassed {{the area}} of the eastern zone outside the centre of the burg, where a narrow, long room was discovered (currently its function remains unknown), which can be associated with some form of approach system, i. e. the entrance to the burg at a certain stage of its use. Finds of disposed ceramic pot fragments and animal bones from the deepest excavated layers (SU 176) {{in that part of the}} site originated in the first half of the thirteenth century, and the excavations here need to be continued. The south-eastern part of the courtyard was excavated as well, and the existence of a burnt wooden construction was registered. The ruins of the wooden structure lay directly at the south-eastern part of the defence wall of the core of the medieval burg (SU 50), and the stratigraphic situation – along with other indicators – clearly suggests the sequence of construction; thus the wooden structure originated in the period after the medieval burg had already fallen into ruin. The remains of this burnt wooden structure are manifested in the form of an upper layer of burnt red earth (SU 172) and a lower layer (SU 180) – burnt black earth with the remains of several carbonized beams in situ. The inventory of finds from the wooden structure (remains of a tiled stove, richly decorated with tiles representing figures of riders hunting, and tiles with the front perforated tile decorated by architectural motifs in the spirit of the Renaissance) suggests a personage of high rank; probably the commander of a military unit that used this abandoned burg as a control defence point for the broader area in the periods of the Ottoman threat in the sixteenth century...|$|E
40|$|Barokna crkva sv. Vlaha, zaštitnika grada Dubrovnika, sagrađena je na mjestu starije crkve (14. stoljeće) izgorjele u požaru godine 1706. Crkva je oštećena u potresu godine 1979., a u Domovinskom ratu (1991. - 1992.) oštećena je pogodcima, najjače na krovu i sjevernom pročelju. Poradi oštećenja pristupilo se obnovi crkve. Prije izradbe statičkog projekta sanaciji crkve prethodila su zaštitna arheološka istraživanja prema izrađenom programu Konzervatorskog odjela u Dubrovniku. Autor u tekstu donosi njihove rezultate: <b>gabarit</b> starije crkve, Lužu, kao i raniju stambenu arhitekture te kameni međaš. Svi navedeni nalazi utemeljeni su na arhivskim vrelima. Archaeological rescue {{research}} in the Church of St. Blaise was entrusted to the Conservation Department in Dubrovnik, based on a programme compiled {{on the basis of}} archival sources and previous scholarly breakthroughs and the results of archaeological {{research in}}side the perimeter of the historical core of the city of Dubrovnik. Thus, archaeological rescue research was conducted by means of a system of ribbon-like test trenches 2 meters in width (east, west and south), from the eastern to western doors of the baroque church (the assumed dimensions of the first church) to the foundational structure. During research conducted along the church’s façade (west), the remnants of residential architecture were found; this structure was demolished during construction of the church. The parallel wall toward the church façade was found at the height of three rows of stone, while the two adjunct walls had the opposite orientation, preserved only at the level of foundations, submerged into the church’s foundation structure. A stone boundary marker was found next to its northwestern end. Two letters, SI, are carved into its face and near the top of its southern side. Based on archival data from 1258, which mention a stone boundary marker with that same signature, this discovery may be interpreted similarly, and it can be chronologically classified into the Romanesque period at the latest. Over and above the aforementioned, it is exceptionally important to stress {{that this is the first}} discovery of a stone boundary marker recognized by means of archival research, and its archaeological discovery has given it a third dimension – its until now unknown appearance. During research, the church’s façade wall was uncovered to the height of one row of stone, subdivided by four pilaster-strips. Morphologically, the wall exhibits the characteristics fixtures of Romanesque unity. The south-west corner pilaster-strip of the church façade, in contrast to the others, is considerably more massive due to reinforcement of the connection of the structure’s two walls. The discovery of the corner pilaster-strips indicated the need for a wall test trench at the connection between the baroque foundation structure (formerly the covered Luža) and the remainder of the Romanesque/Gothic church façade. The side of the north-west pilaster-strip formed just like the south-west one was found during the test dig. The southern church wall, in contrast to the façade, is subdivided by six pilaster-strips, of which the first and last (corner) also belong to the church’s façade and rear. The rear of the church is formed by three apses, of which the one in the middle is more prominent than those on the sides. Besides the corner pilaster-strip of the southern apse, the initial quadrant of its stone lining has also been preserved, while imprints in the plaster testify to its remains on all apses. Upon location of the church’s back wall, the very complex test excavations in the inside eastern church area of the sacristy were halted, because research outside led to discovery of the layout of the Romanesque/ Gothic sacral building. In cooperation with the statics and geomechanical engineers, five more test trenches were dug: three along the western and two along the eastern church wall. Two of these test trenches were made along the façade and rear of the baroque church (stairwell landing) to allow for discovery of the remainder of the Luža. Research has shown that its remains were torn down due to acceptance of Gropelli’s design for the baroque church. The extent to which Dubrovnik’s residents missed the Loža is reflected in the fact that a “surrogate” was made, for its capitals were placed next to the base of the newly-erected church not only as its memento, for they were founded in the cultural tenets of the Mediterranean way of life (all forms of socializing and the gambling of the time). At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the heads and column bases were moved to the museum collection. Given the impossibility of ascertaining the depth of the church’s foundations by manual excavation of the test trenches, despite the use of sump pumps, primarily due to the groundwater level already at 80 cm below street level, research reached a depth of approximately 2 m. During works a great deal of ceramic materials (plates, jugs and bowls) were gathered which were ascribed to the Gothic/Renaissance periods. Numismatic and glass artefacts from the same periods were found...|$|E
