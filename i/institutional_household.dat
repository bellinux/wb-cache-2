40|$|The present thesis {{investigates the}} {{material}} scale of six political economies distributed across the dry-farming plains and piedmonts of the Middle Bronze Age Jazīrah and the Bilād al-Šām. This is done using a comparative and interdisciplinary approach combining the large-scale analysis of administrative cuneiform texts with the compilation of relevant archaeological survey datasets. Drawing on theories and methods developed in landscape archaeology and historical sociology, the thesis builds a regional analysis of economic scale through {{a focus on}} three analytical units; the <b>institutional</b> <b>household,</b> the parent site, and the associated micro-region. Based on a dataset extracted from c. 1500 administrative cuneiform texts from the six study sites, the analytical chapters present a comprehensive discussion of the socio-economic and technological context of chief agricultural and animal resources and the material scale of their production, manipulation, circulation, and consumption. These investigations are undertaken focusing on three spheres of social action, namely the urban neighbourhood, agricultural regimes, and livestock management. The analysis concludes by drawing together quantitative data on {{various aspects of the}} <b>institutional</b> <b>household</b> economy to assess its material scale relative to the subsistence needs of its parent site and associated micro-region. The thesis demonstrates the limited material capabilities of a group of early political organisations relative to their social setting, both {{at the level of the}} parent settlement and, more forcefully, at the surrounding hinterland. It underscores the role of nascent political organisations as local and very resilient economic infrastructures across a politically volatile period of Bronze Age history. In line with recent and comparable investigations on Bronze Age economies, these findings offer critical revisions of traditional notions of the power of the early state. In methodological terms, the thesis formulates a novel means of combining large-scale analyses of text and material culture at a regional level, which can be applied in future studies. ...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in microsimulation modeling of activity and travel demand {{have called for}} the explicit recognition of time-space constraints under which individuals perform their activity and travel patterns. The estimation of time-space prism vertex locations, i. e., the perceived time constraints, is an important development in this context. Stochastic frontier modeling methodology offers a suitable framework for modeling and identifying the expected vertex locations of time space prisms within which people execute activity-travel patterns. In this work, stochastic frontier models of time space prism vertex locations are estimated for samples drawn from a household travel survey conducted in 2001 {{in the city of}} Thane on the west coast of India and National Household Travel Survey 2001, United States. This offers an opportunity to study time constraints governing activity travel patterns of individuals in a developing as well as developed country context. The work also includes comparisons between males and females, workers and non-workers, and developed and developing country contexts to better understand how socio-economic and socio-cultural norms and characteristics affect time space prism constraints. It is found that time space prism constraints in developing country data set can be modeled using the stochastic frontier modeling methodology. It is also found that significant differences exist between workers and non-workers and between males and females,possibly due to the more traditional gender and working status roles in the Indian context. Finally, both differences and similarities were noticed when comparisons were made between results obtained from the data set of India and United States. Many of these differences {{can be explained by the}} presence of other constraints including <b>institutional,</b> <b>household,</b> income, and transportation accessibility constraints that are generally significantly greater in the developing country context...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} multilevel factors that drive {{the demand for}} private supplementary tutoring among Grade 9 students in Mainland China. As {{in other parts of}} the world, private supplementary tutoring in academic subjects has become a major phenomenon in Mainland China. The growing demand is associated with the combined effect of factors at the system, <b>institutional,</b> <b>household,</b> and individual levels. The thesis draws on data collected through a mixed-methods approach in Chongqing which, with a population of 29 million, is the largest of China’s semi-autonomous municipalities. Three major steps were taken to serve the purpose of the research. First, the author analyzed questionnaire responses from students and parents about the features of tutoring received by the sampled students and related factors. Second, descriptive statistics were analyzed to speculate on the links between background factors of the sampled students and their participation in tutoring. Binary logistic regression was further performed to assess the most significant determinants of the probability of participation, using the background factors as predictors. Third, on the basis of the above, data collected through interviews and case studies with various stakeholders were analyzed to explain how factors at multiple levels shaped the demand patterns. The findings allowed the thesis to develop a model of key determinants of demand for tutoring. The model includes macro-level factors such as educational policies, high-stakes examinations, and the traditions of a Confucian culture. At the institutional level, school type was the strongest predictor of participation. Students sampled in the key schools in the metropolitan area were about five times more likely to receive tutoring than those in the remote rural schools. At the household and individual levels, the students’ socioeconomic status and academic aspirations had significant and positive effects on their likelihood of receiving tutoring. According to the study, over 90 % of the students receiving tutoring were tutored by mainstream teachers. This feature, which reflected both students’ demand for tutoring and teachers’ desires to supply it, shaped power relations in the schools. The links between power relations and the patterns of demand for tutoring were investigated through social theories on power bases. The thesis contributes to research in a wider context by refining understanding of the nature of shadow education and by developing theories on the demand for tutoring from a Chinese perspective. It documents teachers’ involvement in private tutoring through the lens of power relations. The research findings have practical implications for policymakers and planners, school leaders, and families in making educational decisions. published_or_final_versionEducationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Tutkimuksen tarkoituksena on tuottaa tulkintaa kotitalouden alan ammattikasvatuksen muotoutumisesta sekä tarkastella alan yhteyksiä suomalaisen yhteiskunnan ja elinkeinojen kehityksen kanssa. Tavoitteena on kuvata ja tulkita alan ammattikasvatuksen historiallisia kerrostumia, muutoksia ja jatkuvuuksia. Tutkimuksen tulkinnan mukaan kotitalousalan ammattikasvatus muodostuu varhais-, maaseutu-, kotitalous- ja palveluammatillisista kehitysvaiheista. Varhaisvaiheessa alan koulutusta syntyi erilaisten taustayhteisöjen tukemana kouluhallinnon ja sittemmin perustetun maataloushallinnon alaisuuteen. Ensimmäinen kotitalouskoulutusta määrittelevä laki ohjasi sitä maatalouden yhteyteen. Maaseutuammatillisen koulutuksen kehittämisestä vastasi maataloushallinto, jonka merkittävä saavutus oli kotitalousopettajakoulutuksen käynnistäminen. Kotitalousammatillisessa vaiheessa syntyi koti- ja laitostalousala. Ammatillinen koulutus järjestyi ammattikasvatushallintoon mittavassa keskiasteen uudistusprojektissa. Palveluammatillinen vaihe ilmeni alan laaja-alaistumisena osaksi palvelusektoria ja kotitalouspalvelujen kehittymisenä. Tuolloin koulutus jakautui ammatilliselle toiselle asteelle ja korkea-asteelle. Tutkimuksessa esitellään kahden tapauskoulutarinan avulla kotitalousalan koulutuksen kehityskaari alkuvaiheesta nykypäivään. Historian tunteminen tarjoaa perspektiivin tuleville valinnoille. Vaikka {{historian}} ratkaisut eivät sellaisenaan ole siirrettävissä nykypäivän toimintamalleiksi, ne voivat tuottaa virikkeitä kehittämisprosesseihin. Alan taustojen tunteminen auttaa eri toimijoita ymmärtämään tehtyjä ratkaisuja ja niiden perusteluita. Näin ollen teos palvelee kaikkia alan ammattikasvattajia. Erityisesti tuleva tutkimus hyötyy tästä perustutkimukseen lukeutuvasta aihepiirin käsittelystä. Tutkimuksen tietoa voidaan soveltaa ammattikasvatuksen ja kasvatuksen tulevassa tutkimuksessa sekä koulutuksen opetus- ja kehittämistyössä. Tutkimuksen voi toivoa löytävän tiensä lukuisten tutkijoiden ja opettajien käsiin. Tulosten perusteella voidaan päätellä, että koulumuotoisesta ammattikasvatuksesta on muodostunut suomalainen tapa tuottaa uutta ammatillista osaamista työelämän tarpeeseen. Koulutustaso ja -rakenne ilmentävät eri aikoina vallinnutta käsitystä koulutuksen järjestämisestä. Yksialaiset koulut ovat muuttuneet pienistä sisäoppilaitoksista ensin tavallisiksi päiväkouluiksi ja edelleen osaksi monialaisia koulutuskonserneja. Opettajien ammattitaidon varaan rakentunut ammatillinen opetus on muuttunut moniammatilliseksi tiimityöksi. Kuusi luokkaa kansakoulua on vaihtunut peruskoulu-, ammattikoulu- ja lukiotaustoiksi. Ennen aikaan kotona opituista arkielämän taidoista on kehittynyt osaamista vaativia ammatteja ja tutkintoja. Kotitaloustyössä on kyse pääosin naisten tekemästä matalapalkkaisesta työstä. Alan ammattien vähäinen arvostus juontuu sekä ammattitaidon yhdistymisestä naisten osaamiseen että sen liittymisestä arkisiin toimiin. The {{aim of this}} doctoral thesis, situated {{within the}} field of education, is to depict and analyze the various development stages, changes and continuums of home economics vocational training from an administrative-political viewpoint. The research question is: “How has home economics vocational education been formed in the case schools?” The framework of reference covers vocational education as a form of education. The paradigm of vocational education within home economics education comprises the field itself, its administration and different aspects of education. The core of the research lies in education, when scrutinized from the administrative-political angle. The methodological orientation is the history of education. The informative research material comprises research papers, statistics and documents that cover the field, education in general and administration of education. The archives of two case schools and material collected through interviews were exploited. The first case school, Elias Lönnrotin Emännyyskoulu, represents vocational training, whereas the second case school, Järvenpään Kotitalousopettajaopisto, is a teacher training facility. Developing home economics education has had two orientations in Finland: it has been developed both for the needs of the countryside and cities. The focus in this thesis is mainly on the rural home economics education. In the countryside home economics comprised the tasks needed to carry out in home, with livestock and when farming. The case schools merge into Laurea University of Applied Sciences’ degree programmes in Service Management. Already before the reform in the 1990 s, when the vocational institute was separated from the university-level education, the case schools had seen major changes in their field of operation, administrative and educational structure. The housekeeping school, which was founded in Sammatti in 1897, operated 50 years as a private school, under the administration of school administration, and taught girls, who had been to elementary school, home economics skills. The housekeeping school was placed under the administration of the Ministry of Agriculture and it became a state-owned school in the 1940 s and it carried out its operations as a housekeeping school until the 1980 s. During the reform of the secondary education the home economics education, which was supervised by agricultural administration, became a part of the vocational education system and was now being supervised by the National Board of Vocational Education. The housekeeping school became a home economics institute that qualified students for vo- cational professions in its programmes. Jobs corresponding these qualifications were available in the field of home economics and <b>institutional</b> <b>household</b> and the education focused on see- ing to the services within public administration. Espoon koti- ja laitostalousoppilaitos was established to provide for educational needs as a result of migration. This school, owned by the federation of municipalities, was founded as an affiliated school of Elias Lönnrotin emäntäkoulu. Espoon koti- ja laitostalousoppilaitos became Espoon palvelualojen oppilaitos in 1996. Its institutes merged into a university of applied sciences and the secondary education re- mained where it was, as part of the federation of municipalities. The school, which was foun- ded in Sammatti, is nowadays Lönnrotin Opisto, owned by Työtehoseura, and it produces know-how for the service field. Järvenpään Kotitalousopettajaopisto (teacher training institute) was established in 1928 and it was supervised by the Ministry of Agriculture to serve the needs of the home economics skills as needed in farming. The operations of Kotitalousopettajisto were stabilized after the years of war and the Great Depression. The housekeeping and home economics schools that were parts of the institute served the needs of teacher training as placement schools. The teacher training institute became a home economics school in 1963 where candidates with university-level degrees could qualify as teachers. When Kotitalousopettajaopisto was closed down in 1997, the teacher training was merged into Jyväskylä Teacher Education College. The secondary vocational education was continued in Tuusulanjärvi-instituutti and the various in- stitute-level programmes joined the local university of applied sciences. The vocational education {{within the field of}} home economics consists of the development stages of an early stage, agricultural industry, home economics and service trade professions. In the early stage of de- velopment, education within the field was created and supported by various communities under the governance of school administration and later on under the governance of agricultural administration. The first law dictating home economics education unified different school forms and forced them under the governance of agricultural administration. The Department of Home Economics was in charge of developing the education in the countryside. The education in its entirety was further advanced by the introduction of teacher training in Järvenpää. The development of home economics education comprises the advancement of middle school education into professional education as well as the introduction of the field of home economics and <b>institutional</b> <b>household.</b> Vocational education focusing on services can be seen as an element of both the advancement of the service field and development of home economics services and the division of education at two levels, vocational upper secondary level and university-level...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Household {{forecasts}} {{are important}} for public planning and for predicting consumer demand. OBJECTIVE The {{purpose of this paper}} is to compute probabilistic household forecasts for Finland and Denmark, taking advantage of unique housing register data covering the whole populations dating back to the 1980 s. A major advantage is that we do not have to rely on small population samples, and we can get quite reliable estimates even for infrequent transitions. A further merit is having time series containing the population in different household positions (dependent child, living with a spouse, living in a consensual union, living alone, lone parent, living in other private <b>household</b> and <b>institutional</b> <b>households)</b> by age and sex. METHODS These series enable us to estimate the uncertainty in the future distribution of the population across household positions. Combining these uncertainty parameters with expected shares computed in a deterministic household forecast, we simulate 3000 sample paths for the household shares for each age and sex. These paths are then combined with 3000 simulations from a stochastic population forecast covering the same period to obtain the predicted number of households and persons in each household position by age and sex. RESULTS According to our forecasts, we expect a strong growth in the number of private households during a 30 -year period, of 27 &#x 160; in Finland and 13 &#x 160; in Denmark. The number of households consisting of a married couple or a person who lives alone are the most certain, and single parents and other private households are the most uncertain...|$|R

40|$|Environment and {{development}} issues {{are complex and}} interdependent. Institutions underpinning state, private sector and civil society actions at various levels must address complexity to ensure social-ecological system integrity. However, responses often operate at only one governance level, with limited interactions with other levels, restricting their ability to support communities who depend on natural resources for their livelihoods. This paper explores <b>institutional</b> factors influencing <b>household</b> entitlements to mangrove system provisioning goods on Vietnam’s northern coast. The environmental entitlements framework is used to identify: (1) current formal and informal institutional structures relating to mangrove systems; (2) the influence of state, private sector and non-governmental organisation actors at various levels; and (3) how actions occurring at and among various levels of governance shape mangrove system entitlements at the local level. Employing a case study approach, this research utilises qualitative methods and a multi-level governance approach to understand prevailing institutional contexts. Results indicate that reforms occurring within weak regulatory frameworks led to the concentration of power at the meso level, reducing the endowments of marginalized households. Market forces facilitated inequality and environmental degradation, negatively impacting household entitlements. Finally, a lack of formally recognised civil society constrained household capabilities to participate in mangrove planning. Mangrove dependent households must be integrated into mangrove planning at the local level, as processes at higher <b>institutional</b> levels affect <b>household</b> environmental entitlements and threaten sustainable outcomes. Ensuring views from the local level feed into the multi-level governance process is vital...|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} two points summarize {{the contribution of}} this study. First, the construction of ISAM focuses on detailed institutional sectors. ISAM constructed in early research (Itoh 2008 b) essentially has four main categories as <b>institutional</b> sectors: <b>household,</b> company, local government, and saving/investment. Moreover, the ISAM proposed in this study has much more detailed categories, especially for companies and governments. For example, by applying this ISAM for empirical analysis, we can analyze the interdependent relationships between social security funds, taxes, and subsidies in local and central governments. In addition, because the ISAM constructed in the early research {{is based on the}} lists of more detailed income/expenditure following the system of national accounts (SNA) in Japan, balanced adjustments of the data gaps of sectors on ISAM are quite easy. The second contribution is that this empirical study applies SPA for ISAM in the flow analysis of spillover effects for regional incomes. This study undertakes a comparative analysis of regional economic spillover mechanisms for household incomes in regions based on the ISAM database with Hokkaido prefecture and the rest of Japan (ROJ).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{implements}} {{the conceptual}} framework sketched by Pyatt (1990) to construct an extended Social Accounting Matrix for Spain in 1995 (ESAM- 95) to consider, {{in addition to the}} market economy, the production of services provided by households through unpaid work. In doing so, the ESAM- 95 integrates the accounts related to market activities (ESA accounts) with non-market activities (non-ESA accounts) in a consistent way. Additional classifications are introduced in both ESA and non-ESA accounts in order to disaggregate the <b>institutional</b> accounts by <b>household</b> type and those of production factors by educational level and gender. The extended SAM is useful to calibrate CGE models in which the distribution of time between paid and unpaid work is a relevant variable.

This paper comprises an extensive analysis of risks of mortgage borrowing by homeowners in the Netherlands and the UK. Here the riskiness of {{the environment in which}} households has to decide, the counterbalancing power of the <b>institutional</b> context, and <b>household</b> behaviour is analysed. The results show that the riskiness of mortgage borrowing in the UK is significantly higher than in the Netherlands. We show that dominance of the institutional context of the Netherlands is the main contributor to these results...|$|R

This paper examines the possibilities for smallholders to engage in plantations as a potential means for poverty alleviation. The paper analyzes the possibilities through an empirical study of household tree growing in rural Vietnam, {{with a focus on}} differences in the capacities of households to gain land endowments and translate endowments into tree entitlements. Employing Heckman regression models and qualitative institutional analyses, the paper finds that better-off households are more likely to possess forestland, grow trees, and invest in plantations than poor ones. In addition, land, plantations, and investment tend to be larger for the better-off than the poor. Better-off households are {{in a better position to}} engage in tree plantations due to, among other factors, the <b>institutional</b> mechanisms differentiating <b>household</b> access to land and finance...|$|R

Specifically, it analyses the experiences of workers who lost their jobs in the 2001 collapse of an Australian airline, Ansett Airlines. Since Ansett employees’ savings were {{tied up in the}} Ansett corporate structure, its workers faced the double jeopardy of losing both their careers and their savings. The article illuminates the role of financial losses in overall outcomes and argues that an adequate understanding of post-redundancy experiences must incorporate employment, wellbeing and financial effects. The article concludes that employment policies pay insufficient attention to the financial risks that accompany job loss. To reduce the adverse impacts of job loss for middle-income <b>households,</b> <b>institutional</b> frameworks need to address the interactions among labour markets, financial markets and housing markets...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the main findings resulted from indicators analysis (gross value added, gross operating surplus, gross national income, etc.) which characterize {{the institutional sectors}} – the ones emphasizing the different behaviors and results between the competition and non-competition sectors (households and general government respectively). This analysis is very necessary, because the European Commission, through the specialized directorate - DGECFIN, has included in the forecast framework the indicators regarding incomes and expenditures of institutional sectors (compensation of employees, gross disposable income, gross saving) for member states. The macroeconomic forecast has not yet used this economic approach. The main inconvenience in estimating institutional sectors accounts forecast refers on one hand to {{the gap between the}} statistical and forecasting horizons, the statistical data regarding the institutional sectors are available only after a period of two years since the event has occurred (the data series for Romania end in 2004) and, on the other hand, the aggregates evaluation is only carried out in current prices, increasing thus the relativity of data series by using conventional deflators. Until now they are the first estimates referring to the compensation of employees and the gross disposable income. *This paper is partially based on the study “Overview of the economic results by institutional sectors”, NCP, 2007 <b>institutional</b> sector, <b>households,</b> gross value added, compensation of employees, gross operating surplus, gross national income...|$|R
