40|$|The testis {{presents}} a special immunological environment, considering its property of immune privilege that tolerates allo- and auto-antigens. Testicular immune privilege was once {{believed to be}} mainly based on the sequestration of antigens from the immune system by the blood-testis barrier in the seminiferous epithelium. Substantial evidence supports {{the view that the}} combination of physical structure, testicular cells, and cytokines controls immune responses in the testis to preserve the structural and functional integrity of testicular immune privilege. Both systemic immune tolerance and local immunosuppression help maintain the <b>immune</b> privilege <b>status.</b> Constitutive expression of anti-inflammatory factors in testicular cells is critical for local immunosuppression. However, the testis locally generates an efficient innate immune system against pathogens. Disruption of these mechanisms may lead to orchitis and impair fertility.

40|$|Macrophage {{involvement}} in viral infections and antiviral states is common. However, this involvement {{has not been}} well-studied in the paradigm of macrophage polarization, which typically has been categorized by the dichotomy of classical (M 1) and alternative (M 2) statuses. Recent studies have revealed the complexity of macrophage polarization in response to various cellular mediators and exogenous stimuli by adopting a multipolar view to revisit the differential process of macrophages, especially those re-polarized during viral infections. Here, through examination of viral infections targeting macrophages/monocytic cells, {{we focus on the}} direct involvement of macrophage polarization during viral infections. Type I and type III interferons (IFNs) are critical in regulation of viral pathogenesis and host antiviral infection; thus, we propose to incorporate IFN-mediated antiviral states into the framework of macrophage polarization. This view is supported by the multifunctional properties of type I IFNs, which potentially elicit and regulate both M 1 - and M 2 -polarization in addition to inducing the antiviral state, and by the discoveries of viral mechanisms to adapt and modulate macrophage polarization. Indeed, several recent studies have demonstrated effective prevention of viral diseases through manipulation of macrophage <b>immune</b> <b>statuses...</b>|$|R

40|$|Central {{nervous system}} (CNS) {{inflammatory}} demyelinating diseases (IDDs) are {{a group of}} disorders with different aetiologies, characterized by inflammatory lesions. These disorders include multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), and idiopathic transverse myelitis (ITM). Differential diagnosis of the CNS IDDs still remains challenging due to frequent overlap of clinical and radiological manifestation, leading to increased demands for new biomarker discovery. Since cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolites may reflect the status of CNS tissues and provide an interfacial linkage between blood and CNS tissues, we explored multi-component biomarker for different IDDs from CSF samples using gas chromatography mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling coupled to multiplex bioinformatics approach. We successfully constructed the single model with multiple metabolite variables in coordinated regression with clinical characteristics, expanded disability status scale, oligoclonal bands, and protein levels. The multi-composite biomarker simultaneously discriminated four different <b>immune</b> <b>statuses</b> (a total of 145 samples; 54 MS, 49 NMOSD, 30 ITM, and 12 normal controls). Furthermore, systematic characterization of transitional metabolic modulation identified relapse-associated metabolites and proposed insights into the disease network underlying type-specific metabolic dysfunctionality.

40|$|Allogeneic mesenchymal stem or stromal cells (MSCs) are {{proposed}} as cell therapies for degenerative, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases. The feasibility of allogeneic MSC therapies rests {{heavily on the}} concept that these cells avoid or actively suppress the immunological responses that cause rejection of most allogeneic cells and tissues. In this article {{the validity of the}} <b>immune</b> privileged <b>status</b> of allogeneic MSCs is explored in the context of recent literature. Current data that provide the mechanistic basis for immune modulation by MSCs are reviewed with particular attention to how MSCs modify the triggering and effector functions of innate and adaptive immunity. The ability of MSCs to induce regulatory dendritic and T-cell populations is discussed with regard to cell therapy for autoimmune disease. Finally, we examine the evidence for and against the <b>immune</b> privileged <b>status</b> of allogeneic MSCs in vivo. Allogeneic MSCs emerge as cells that are responsive to local signals and exert wide-ranging, predominantly suppressive, effects on innate and adaptive immunity. Nonetheless, these cells also retain a degree of immunogenicity in some circumstances that may limit MSC longevity and attenuate their beneficial effects. Ultimately successful allogeneic cell therapies will rely on an improved understanding of the parameters of MSC–immune system interactions in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The {{resident}} gut bacteria of the {{gastrointestinal tract}} (gut microbiota) {{have been known}} to influence the immune system. Yet the role of the immune system in shaping the gut microbiota composition across an organismâs lifespan remains unclear. Previous work in mice has been conflicting and thus remains inconclusive. Here, Drosophila melanogaster was used as a model organism with a simpler gut commensal community to address this issue. Using four strains of Drosophila reflecting different <b>immune</b> <b>statuses,</b> we found that wild type and immune-compromised strains had the same Acetobacteraceae-dominant pattern across their adult lifespan. However, flies with a constitutively active immune system had a distinctive gut microbiota structure that persisted even when maternally transmitted bacteria were removed and was distinguishable from its genetic background. Additionally, co-housing experiments showed that the local environment also {{played an important role in}} gut microbiota composition. When the physiology of the gut was explored, it showed that the gut internal environment was affected as a consequence of having a de-regulated immune system. Together, our results in Drosophila showed that a constantly active immune system shaped microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract. Given the evolutionary conservation of innate immunity between insects and mammals our data has implications for the shaping of the gut microbiota structure in humans with a chronically inflamed intestine. </p...|$|R

40|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-leading {{cause of}} cancer-related deaths in Western countries. Today, {{the role of}} the host’s immune system in {{controlling}} the progression and spread of solid tumors is broadly established. Tumor immunosurveillance escape mechanisms, such as those involving dendritic cells (DCs), the most important antigen-presenting cells, are likewise recognized processes involved in cancer. The present study evaluates the ability of CRC patients to generate DCs in vitro from circulating monocytes at both pre- and post-operative timepoints; the results are correlated with the stage of disease to shed light on the systemic <b>immune</b> <b>statuses</b> of CRC patients. Our data showed that patients’ DCs had lower co-stimulatory molecule expression and were less able to present antigens to allogeneic T cells compared to healthy controls’ (HC) DCs. Furthermore altered cytokine secretion, such as increased IL- 10 and reduced IL- 12 and TNF-α, was observed. At the post-operative timepoints we observed a recovery of the patients’ ability to generate immature DCs, compared to HCs, but the maturational capacity remained affected. Our study conclusively highlights the persistently impaired in vitro generation of fully mature and functional DCs, which appears to be more altered during advanced stages.

Methods　Twenty-four Wistar rats were randomly divided into the sham group (n= 8), normal saline (NS) group (n= 8) and ulinastatin (UTI) group (n= 8). The sepsis model was reproduced by cecum ligation and puncture (CLP). The spleens of the rats were harvested 24 h after the operation. The expression levels of Th 17 and CD 4 +CD 25 + Treg in spleen tissue were detected by flow cytometry, and Treg/Th 17 was calculated after the examination. Expression levels of forkhead transcription factor p 3 (Foxp 3) and retinoid-related orphan nuclear receptor γt (RORγt) mRNA in spleen tissue were quantified by RT-PCR. The effects of ulinastatin on the animals were evaluated. Results　The expression levels of CD 4 +CD 25 + Treg and Th 17 cells were significantly higher in NS group than in sham group and UTI group (P 0. 05), but the ratio of Treg/Th 17 was lower in UTI group than in NS group (P 0. 05).
