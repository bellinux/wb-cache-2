5|$|Bill McGinnis quickly {{discovered}} homeotic gene sequences, homeoboxes, in animals in other phyla, in vertebrates such as frogs, birds, and mammals; they were later {{also found in}} fungi such as yeasts, and in plants. There were evidently strong similarities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> that controlled development across all the eukaryotes.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{variability}} of the mallard's genetic code, which gives it its vast interbreeding capability, mutations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> that decide plumage colour are very common and {{have resulted in a}} wide variety of hybrids such as Brewer's duck (mallard × gadwall, Anas strepera).|$|E
5|$|Some {{mitochondrial}} {{functions are}} performed only in {{specific types of}} cells. For example, mitochondria in liver cells contain enzymes {{that allow them to}} detoxify ammonia, a waste product of protein metabolism. A mutation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> regulating any of these functions can result in mitochondrial diseases.|$|E
50|$|HSAN IC is {{associated}} with heterozygous missense mutations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SPTLC2 <b>gene.</b> <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> encodes SPTLC2 protein {{which is one of}} two subunits of SPT. As mutations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> affect <b>the</b> same enzyme as those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SPTLC1 <b>gene,</b> <b>the</b> molecular basis of the disease is suggested to be {{the same as that of}} HSAN IA.|$|R

5|$|The genetic {{mutations}} most {{commonly associated with}} endometrioid adenocarcinoma are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> PTEN, a tumor suppressor; PIK3CA, a kinase; KRAS, a GTPase that functions in signal transduction; and CTNNB1, involved in adhesion and cell signaling. The CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) gene is most commonly mutated in the squamous subtype of endometrioid adenocarcinoma.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from studies of the molecular genetics of model plants such as the Thale cress, Arabidopsis thaliana, a weedy species in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). The genome or hereditary information contained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> of this species is encoded by about 135 million base pairs of DNA, forming {{one of the smallest}} genomes among flowering plants. Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000. The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium distachyon, has made them important model species for understanding the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of cereals, grasses and monocots generally.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{mutations}} in the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit (Cav1.1) {{have been described}} in Southern Chinese with TPP. The mutations are located in {{a different part of}} the gene from those described in the related condition familial periodic paralysis. In TPP, the mutations described are single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the hormone response element responsive to thyroid hormone, implying that transcription of the gene and production of ion channels may be altered by increased thyroid hormone levels. Furthermore, mutations have been reported <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> coding for potassium voltage-gated channel, Shaw-related subfamily, member 4 (Kv3.4) and sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha (Na41.4).|$|E

5|$|Polymorphisms (normal variations) in {{particular}} genes {{have been linked}} with {{an increased risk of}} severe dengue complications. Examples include the genes coding for the proteins known as TNFα, mannan-binding lectin, CTLA4, TGFβ, DC-SIGN, PLCE1, and particular forms of human leukocyte antigen from gene variations of HLA-B. A common genetic abnormality, especially in Africans, known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, appears to increase the risk. Polymorphisms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> for the vitamin D receptor and FcγR seem to offer protection against severe disease in secondary dengue infection.|$|E
5|$|Specifically, {{aggregation}} of TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein, {{has been}} found in ALS/MND patients, and mutations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> coding for these proteins have been identified in familial cases of ALS/MND. These mutations promote the misfolding of the proteins into a prion-like conformation. The misfolded form of TDP-43 forms cytoplasmic inclusions in afflicted neurons, and is found depleted in the nucleus. In addition to ALS/MND and FTLD-U, TDP-43 pathology is a feature of many cases of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. The misfolding of TDP-43 is largely directed by its prion-like domain. This domain is inherently prone to misfolding, while pathological mutations in TDP-43 have been found to increase this propensity to misfold, explaining the presence of these mutations in familial cases of ALS/MND. As in yeast, the prion-like domain of TDP-43 {{has been shown to be}} both necessary and sufficient for protein misfolding and aggregation.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, a DNA {{sequencing}} {{study indicated}} that parallel evolution in humans and dogs is most apparent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> for digestion and metabolism, neurological processes, and cancer, likely {{as a result of}} shared selection pressures.|$|E
25|$|As {{dogs are}} a {{subspecies}} but their breeds are distinct genetic units, and because only certain breeds {{share the same}} type of cancers as humans, the differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> of different breeds may be useful in human medical research.|$|E

25|$|Cloning {{studies have}} been carried out on DNA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> {{associated}} with the affected homeotic functions in the mutants discussed above. These studies used serial analysis of gene expression throughout floral development to show patterns of tissue expression, which, in general, correspond with the predictions of the ABC model.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{hypothesized}} {{that much of the}} difference between humans and chimpanzees is attributable to the regulation of gene expression rather than differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> themselves. Analyses of conserved non-coding sequences, which often contain functional and thus positively selected regulatory regions, address this possibility.|$|E
25|$|These are the {{earliest}} multicellular organisms in Earth’s history, {{despite the fact}} that unicellularity had {{been around for a long}} time before that. The requirements for multicellularity were embedded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> of some of these cells, specifically choanoflagellates. These are thought to be the precursors for all multicellular organisms. They are highly related to sponges (Porifera), which are the simplest multicellular organisms.|$|E

25|$|Mutations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> {{encoding}} for {{isocitrate dehydrogenase}} 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) occur in 10-20% {{of patients with}} myelodysplastic syndrome, and confer a worsened prognosis in low-risk MDS. Because the incidence of IDH1/2 mutations increases as the disease malignancy increases, these findings together suggest that IDH1/2 mutations are important drivers of progression of MDS to a more malignant disease state.|$|E
25|$|A general DNA {{study was}} {{arranged}} by the world-renowned researcher of the etrog, Prof. Eliezer E. Goldschmidt and colleagues, who positively testified 12 famous accessions of citron for purity and being genetically related.
