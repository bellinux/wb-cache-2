2500|$|The Batch 2 {{ships are}} {{fundamentally}} different in appearance and capabilities from the preceding Batch 1. Notable differences include the [...] long hull, {{a top speed}} of , Merlin-capable flight deck, a displacement of around 2,000 tonnes and greatly expanded capacity for accommodating troops. The Batch 2 ships also have a different (full width) superstructure, and a fundamentally different above-water hullform shape (greater bow flare, different & less-pronounced forward <b>knuckle</b> <b>line</b> compared to the Batch 1 ships, lack of the distinctive fwd & aft bulwarks of the Batch 1 vessels). The class is also fitted with the Kelvin Hughes SharpEye integrated radar system for navigation, the Terma Scanter 4100 2D radar for air and surface surveillance, and a BAE CMS-1 Combat Management System. The Batch 2 ships therefore arguably represent a distinctly separate class to the preceding Batch 1.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{focus on}} the ship form {{optimization}} of a 62 -feet yacht and uses experienced method based on amount of statistical data to change the width of <b>knuckle</b> <b>lines</b> {{in order to reduce}} the resistance of the hull, including comparison of performance of stability and see keeping. 0 Prefaces Study for the yacht resistance performance abroad already has a series of model test data and statistics, including regression formula which are for calculation of the resistance and map like the TMB 62 series. There are also attempts of computational optimization for resistance. In our country, it is rare for studying the performance of resistance and making improvement on it. Lacking of statistics about the yachts we can only design according to the experience abroad. Especially in the context of rapid development of China's yacht industry, it is meaningful attempt that using statistics and empirical methods abroad to optimize resistance performance of the yacht. 62 -feet yacht is the common product which is the target of the ship form optimization of resistance in this paper. 1 Options for optimization According to statistical data by Niels E. Sorensen-Viale, properties of a stepless planing hull like principal dimensions, coefficience of area, longitudinal coordinate of gravity, angle of deadrise and shape of transverse section have a corresponding value and curve [1]. The ship form optimization of 62 -feet yacht in this paper is changing the shape of <b>knuckle</b> <b>lines</b> properly based on the experienced method out of statistical data. Bilge and bottom plane are connected by hard chine which make the water stream flow out through broadside to reduce wet surface area and the bottom plane become a planing plane. According to statistical data, the biggest width of high speed stepless planing hull lies in 40 %L from stem [3]. Proportion between width of <b>knuckle</b> <b>lines</b> at transom stern(Bt) and biggest width of knuckle lines(Bpmax) is in the range of 0. 65 to 0. 8...|$|R
