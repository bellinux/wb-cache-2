5|$|A {{few days}} before fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) investigates a murder in a {{suburban}} home, in which occult paraphernalia has been {{laid out in a}} disorganized manner. Watts contacts Black <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> the case. However, Black is still recovering from the murder of his friend Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich), who was murdered in Black's home. Watts hangs up when he sees Sammael looking through the house's window, {{but by the time he}} can investigate, Sammael is gone.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Lang and {{his wife}} Thea von Harbou were {{developing}} the film M. Von Harbou and Lang were friends with Jacques since creating the first Mabuse film Dr. Mabuse the Gambler and went on vacation with each other. Lang asked Jacques <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> the screenplay for M and asked for suggestions for a new Mabuse project. Jacques sent Lang his unfinished work for Mabuse's Colony. Lang used the idea of Mabuse's will from the story and began working on an outline to what would become The Testament of Dr. Mabuse.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, modern Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) {{asks his}} {{colleague}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> a case the Group have not authorized; he remains cryptic {{as to what}} it is. They travel to Germany to investigate {{the murder of a}} Dr. Schlossburg, whose lab is found to house a mummified body. The two are arrested by German police, but when the police realize they have apprehended fellow investigators they promise cooperation. However, the pair learn that Schlossburg has already been cremated; later they narrowly escape death when their rental car has been rigged with a car bomb.|$|E

5|$|Henry III {{added to}} the {{endowment}} left by Peter des Roches, donating farmland, urban property in Southampton and elsewhere, and spiritual revenues from churches. By 1291, taxation returns show that the abbey had a clear annual revenue of £81, a comfortable income. However, shortly afterwards a period of bad management resulted in the abbey accruing substantial debts, and it was soon almost bankrupt. In 1328 the government was forced to appoint an administrator, John of Mere, to address the crisis. Despite forcing the abbot to apply revenues to debt repayment and to sell many of the estates, the operation was only partly successful. Ten years later the abbey was again appealing to the king <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> a disastrous financial situation. The monks blamed their problems {{on the cost of}} providing hospitality to the many travellers by sea, and the king's sailors who landed at the abbey. The king provided some small grants enabling the abbey to overcome its difficulties but the property sales meant that the abbey's income never recovered and it settled into what has been described as genteel poverty.|$|E
5|$|In Matamoros and Brownsville, curanderos – {{practitioners}} of curanderismo – offered works {{of white and}} black magic. These services are known as brujería (witchcraft). People consult healers and fortune tellers <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> relationships: to revive their romance, to end a marriage, to make someone fall in love, or to hurt someone. People also consult them to drive away negative energy, predict the future and dangerous events, to improve their health, or to bring positive energy. Cisneros grew closer to curanderismo after her firstborn, David, died after being thrown from a moving vehicle by a friend {{while he was in}} St. Joe in 1974. People close to Cisneros described her as a person who endured several tragic events growing up. One of her uncles committed suicide when she was young, and her brother drowned as a teenager. But, several others who were close to her maintained that after her son died, Cisneros started to show signs of insanity, became more protective of her children, and began visiting local curanderas.|$|E

25|$|His {{relationship}} with his brother Galileo became especially difficult in his last years. Many of the letters between the two have been preserved; Michelagnolo ceaselessly implored his elder brother for money, and <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> his difficult children (Vincenzo, born in 1608, was particularly troublesome).|$|E
25|$|Monasteries {{developed}} {{not only}} as spiritual centers, but also centers of intellectual learning and medical practice. Locations of the monasteries were secluded and designed to be self-sufficient, which required the monastic inhabitants to produce their own food and also care for their sick. Prior {{to the development of}} hospitals, people from the surrounding towns looked to the monasteries <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> their sick.|$|E
25|$|For 2016, British {{clothing}} and food company Marks & Spencer launched an integrated marketing campaign {{centered on a}} modern interpretation of Mrs. Claus.

25|$|In 1995, Spanish airline Helicopteros del Sureste {{approached}} Melnyk <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> {{purchase of}} Soviet-made helicopters. Melnyk used {{the opportunity to}} move to Alicante (Spain), where he became contracted as a pilot and instructor specializing in Soviet-designed helicopters with the Helicopteros del Sureste. He trained at least 25 local pilots and also has worked in aerial firefighting. As of 2006, Melnyk had 13,400 recorded flight hours.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{original}} outline, Adams {{was said to}} make up the stories as he wrote. He turned to John Lloyd <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> the final two episodes of the first series. Lloyd contributed bits from an unpublished science fiction book of his own, called GiGax. Very little of Lloyd's material survived in later adaptations of Hitchhiker's, such as the novels and the TV series. The TV series was based on the first six radio episodes, and sections contributed by Lloyd were largely re-written.|$|E
25|$|Garda Patrol ran for {{a number}} of years on RTÉ One. It was a fifteen-minute weekly show asking <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> crimes from the public. In the early 1990s RTÉ revamped the show as a monthly hour-long show called Crime Line, hosted by David Harvey and Marian Finucane (Towards the end of the series was hosted by Anne Doyle). In the mid-2000s RTÉ {{replaced}} CrimeLine with a similar show Crime Call. Crime Call is presented by Anna Cassin and Con Murphy.|$|E

25|$|Canada {{had long}} had a small fishing {{protection}} force attached to the Department of Marine and Fisheries, but relied on Britain for maritime protection. Britain was increasingly engaged in an arms race with Germany, and in 1908, asked the colonies <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> the navy. The Conservative Party argued that Canada should merely contribute money to the purchase and upkeep of some British Royal Navy vessels. Some French-Canadian nationalists felt that no aid should be sent; others advocated an independent Canadian navy that could aid the British in times of need.|$|E
25|$|Mills’ {{philosophy}} always possessed for him strong musical implications. “The {{purpose of}} Music is to reveal to man his innate at-one-ment with a harmonic state of Being”, he said. When three singers (from the vocal group The Free Design) asked him <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> their voices in 1976, Mills soon found himself re-engaging {{the world of}} concertizing. Within a short time, the three singers were joined by seven others, and the a cappella vocal ensemble he called The Star-Scape Singers was formed. These singers were ultimately acclaimed in the United States and abroad as creators of a renaissance in choral art.|$|E
25|$|In 1916, Rinehart asked {{theatrical}} producer Edgar Selwyn {{whether he}} thought a mystery play would be successful if it kept the mystery unresolved until the end; Selwyn replied that such a play could make a million dollars. Rinehart decided to base this play on The Circular Staircase, which had been adapted for film in 1915. Although she began work on the play in spring 1917, she was distracted by work for the United States Department of War during World War I and by fall 1918 had only written the first two acts. Rinehart approached Hopwood <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> completing the play {{while she was in}} Europe for the War Department. Hopwood was interested, but did not work on the play when she was overseas.|$|E

25|$|Presented {{with the}} choice of making another try at {{capturing}} Paksong quickly before the rainy season closed down military activities, or waiting until next dry season, the planners of Sayasila decided to ask <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> the former. They garnered a commitment of 40 or more daily sorties of tactical air support from the U.S. Air Force for Sayasila through 25 September. Instrument flight rules target boxes containing no friendly forces were delineated so radar-directed bombing in them could occur despite unfavorable weather. They also managed to persuade neighboring MR 3 to loan them another guerrilla regiment, Groupement Mobile 32 (GM 32) to continue the assault. Once again, the two objectives were taking Paksong and opening Route 23 towards the Vietnamese border.|$|E
25|$|The duo {{are taken}} to Washington, D.C., where Agent Dakota Whitney {{requests}} Mulder's expertise with the paranormal {{as they have been}} led to a clue, a severed human arm, by Father Joseph Fitzpatrick Crissman. He is a former priest defrocked for the molestation of thirty-seven altar boys, and claims God is sending him visions of the crimes. A second woman, driving home after swimming in a natatorium, is run off the road by a truck driven by Janke Dacyshyn, who then abducts her. Father Joe is again recruited <b>for</b> <b>help</b> <b>with</b> the second abducted woman. After a grueling nighttime search in a snow-covered field, he leads the FBI to what {{turns out to be a}} frozen burial ground of people and body parts. Analysis of the remains, along with tracking down the recent movements from the second abducted woman's car crash, eventually leads them to Dacyshyn, an organ transporter in Richmond, Virginia, and his husband, Franz Tomczeszyn, who was among the youths Father Joe sexually abused.|$|E
