5|$|Impression Management {{is defined}} as when an {{individual}} attempts to present an acceptable image to those around him or her verbally or nonverbally (480). This definition is based on Goffman’s idea that individuals see themselves as others view them, so in essence they attempt {{to see themselves as}} if they are outside looking in (480). Goffman also dedicating this work to discover the subtle ways humans present acceptable images by concealing <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> conflict with the images for a particular situation. For instance, concealing tattoos when applying for a job in which tattoos would be inappropriate, or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls which society as a whole may see as abnormal.|$|E
5|$|Carr also theorizes {{that the}} {{capacity}} to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain {{of much of the}} painstaking knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back then some workers complained that they felt they were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.|$|E

Developing {{a model of}} clinical <b>information</b> needs <b>that</b> <b>may</b> arise {{in the context of}} viewing information about a specific patient is a preliminary step to finding an efficient, useful solution to the information retrieval problem. This poster illustrates a method of modeling clinical information needs {{in the context of a}} specific patient that that is adapted from entity-relationship models used in database design...|$|R

25|$|An {{investment}} bank {{can also be}} split into private and public functions with a Chinese wall separating the two to prevent information from crossing. The private areas of the bank deal with private insider <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> not be publicly disclosed, while the public areas, such as stock analysis, deal with public information.|$|E
25|$|PC-based PHRs {{are subject}} to {{physical}} loss and damage of the personal computer and the data that it contains.

25|$|Mechanical senses {{provide the}} insect with <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> direct orientation, general movement, flight from enemies, {{reproduction}} and feeding and are elicited from the sense organs that {{are sensitive to}} mechanical stimuli such as pressure, touch and vibration. Hairs (setae) on the cuticle are responsible for this as they are sensitive to vibration touch and sound.|$|E

25|$|EELS spectrometers {{can often}} be {{operated}} in both spectroscopic and imaging modes, allowing for isolation or rejection of elastically scattered beams. As for many images inelastic scattering will include <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> not {{be of interest to}} the investigator thus reducing observable signals of interest, EELS imaging can be used to enhance contrast in observed images, including both bright field and diffraction, by rejecting unwanted components.|$|E
25|$|In Ireland and in Wales, the {{language}} of the monumental stone inscriptions is termed Primitive Irish. The transition to Old Irish, {{the language}} of the earliest sources in the Latin alphabet, takes place in about the 6th century. Since ogham inscriptions consist almost exclusively of personal names and marks possibly indicating land ownership, linguistic <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> be glimpsed from the Primitive Irish period is mostly restricted to phonological developments.|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound {{provides}} {{visualization of}} the thoracic and abdominal structures, and can sometimes rule out or narrow down a diagnosis. <b>Information</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> {{be gleaned from}} ultrasonographic findings include the presence of sand, distention, entrapment, strangulation, intussusception, and wall thickening of intestinal loops, as well as diagnose nephrosplenic entrapment, peritonitis, abdominal tumors, and inguinal or scrotal hernias. Abdominal ultrasound requires an experienced operator to accurately diagnose the cause of colic. It may be applied {{against the side of}} the horse, as well as transrectally.|$|E

25|$|The {{algorithm}} {{attempts to}} set up a congruence of squares modulo n (the integer to be factorized), which often leads to a factorization of n. The algorithm works in two phases: the data collection phase, where it collects <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> lead to a congruence of squares; and the data processing phase, where it puts all the data it has collected into a matrix and solves it to obtain a congruence of squares. The data collection phase can be easily parallelized to many processors, but the data processing phase requires large amounts of memory, and is difficult to parallelize efficiently over many nodes or if the processing nodes do not each have enough memory to store the whole matrix. The block Wiedemann algorithm can be used {{in the case of a}} few systems each capable of holding the matrix.|$|E
25|$|Lehi was {{forcibly}} disarmed {{and many}} members were arrested, but nobody {{was charged with}} the killings. The Israel Police, along with the military police and security services, investigated the assassination, but failed to identify any {{of the participants in}} the assassination, and the case was eventually closed without any of the participants having been identified. It has been suggested that the reasons for the failure of the investigation were poor coordination between these bodies, which resulted in <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have assisted the police not being turned over to them, and the lack of proficiency among police officers and investigators in the early days of the Israel Police. Yellin-Mor and another Lehi member, Mattityahu Shmulevitz, were charged with belonging to a terrorist organization. They were found guilty but immediately released and pardoned. Yellin-Mor had meanwhile been elected to the first Knesset. Years later, Cohen's role was uncovered by David Ben-Gurion's biographer Michael Bar Zohar, while Cohen was working as Ben-Gurion's personal bodyguard. The first public admission of Lehi's role in the killing was made on the anniversary of the assassination in 1977. The statute of limitations for the murder had expired in 1971.|$|E
25|$|We want {{every man}} and woman in these two {{counties}} to recall the dates of these murders and also to recall whether or not any person close to them was missing or out of pocket during those nights. Persons who have such information and have been withholding it when they know they should report it are leaving themselves open to possible charges of complicity in event the slayer is captured. Make no mistake {{about the fact that}} the slayer will be captured because we will not give up this hunt until he has been captured or killed. All information received will be treated confidentially. We urge you to come in and tell what you know. Don't be hesitant or fear that you are causing an innocent man embarrassment and trouble in as much all investigation will be confidential. This is no time to take any chance on information which might lead us to the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We believe that we are justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder. Bear in mind--this killer may strike at any one. He may strike at persons close to him. For that reason, we believe any person with <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> lead us to the murderer should act in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E

500|$|Encouraged by a clairvoyant's {{assurance}} that her elder son {{was alive and}} well, in February 1863 Lady Tichborne, Roger's mother, began placing regular newspaper advertisements in The Times offering a reward for information about Roger Tichborne {{and the fate of}} the Bella. None of these produced results; however, in May 1865 Lady Tichborne saw an advertisement placed by Arthur Cubitt of Sydney, Australia, on behalf of his [...] "Missing Friends Agency". She wrote to him, and he agreed to place a series of notices in Australian newspapers.
