5|$|The most {{enduring}} Roman legacy {{may be that}} created by Hadrian's Wall. Its line approximates the border between modern Scotland and England and it created {{a distinction between the}} northern third and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain that plays a part in modern political <b>debate.</b> <b>This</b> is probably coincidental however, as there is little to suggest its influence {{played an important role in}} the early Medieval period after the fall of Rome.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} that the general strike could be used, but {{only as a last}} resort, became dominant in the party during the mass strike <b>debate.</b> <b>This</b> caused much concern among the conservatives in the party, especially among many trade unionists. At a meeting in February 1906, the trade unionists were placated by party leaders, who said they would attempt to prevent a general strike at all costs. The FVdG reacted by publishing the secret protocols from the meeting in Die Einigkeit, greatly angering the party leadership.|$|E
5|$|This was at {{odds with}} the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program, and {{resulted}} in pressure on federal officials to develop a civilian nuclear power industry that could help justify the government's considerable expenditures on the nuclear weapons program. In 1953 the Atomic Energy Commission presented a set of draft amendments to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy for consideration. After some <b>debate,</b> <b>this</b> resulted in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.|$|E

5|$|Within debates {{attempting}} {{to decipher the}} conclusion of Candide lies another primary Candide <b>debate.</b> <b>This</b> one concerns {{the degree to which}} Voltaire was advocating a pessimistic philosophy, by which Candide and his companions give up hope for a better world. Critics argue that the group's reclusion on the farm signifies Candide and his companions' loss of hope {{for the rest of the}} human race. This view is to be compared to a reading that presents Voltaire as advocating a melioristic philosophy and a precept committing the travellers to improving the world through metaphorical gardening. This debate, and others, focuses on the question of whether or not Voltaire was prescribing passive retreat from society, or active industrious contribution to it.|$|E
5|$|The University of Minnesota's Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs {{hosted the}} first mayoral debate on March 27, with Schiff {{among the five}} {{declared}} candidates who were seeking the DFL nomination. A week later, on April 4, Schiff {{took part in the}} city's second mayoral <b>debate,</b> <b>this</b> time located at a Kingfield-neighborhood church. During the proceedings, he pledged that he would abide by the DFL's endorsement, making him the sole candidate to vow so among the five candidates seeking the endorsement at the time. Schiff also participated in the city's first mayoral debate dealing specifically with issues concerning Minneapolis's Somali population, an event that took place on May 31 and was hosted at a Somali restaurant on Lake Street. Schiff received endorsements from the Minneapolis Firefighters Union, state representative Karen Clark, and former Vikings punter Chris Kluwe, among others.|$|E
5|$|In July 1991, Špegelj and Đodan's demands were {{backed up}} {{by a number of}} Croatian Parliament members during a {{parliamentary}} <b>debate.</b> <b>This</b> led Tuđman to dismiss Đodan the same month he was appointed Defence Minister, and Špegelj resigned his post on 3 August. The deteriorating situation in eastern Croatia including JNA forces' removal of the ZNG from Baranja, intermittent fighting around Osijek, Vukovar and Vinkovci increasing losses and the growing conviction that the JNA actively supported the Croatian Serb revoltforced Tuđman to act. On 22 August, he issued an ultimatum to the federal Yugoslav authorities demanding the withdrawal of the JNA to its barracks {{by the end of the}} month. The ultimatum stated if the JNA failed to comply, Croatia would consider it an army of occupation and take corresponding action. On 1 September, the EC proposed a ceasefire and a peace conference was accepted by Tuđmandespite his ultimatumand by the Yugoslav Presidency. The conference started on 7 September, but only four days later, the Croatian member and chair of the presidency Stjepan Mesić ordered the JNA to return to its barracks within 48 hours. The move was motivated by Tuđman's impression that the conference would continue while the ZNG lost ground. Even though the order was disputed by other members of the body, it gave Croatia a justification to openly confront the JNA.|$|E

25|$|The {{doctrine}} of individual ministerial responsibility is a constitutional convention adopted from the Westminster constitutional model. According to this doctrine, Parliament imposes {{a check on}} the Cabinet by scrutinising government bills and actions, and calling upon ministers to justify policies before the House in open <b>debate.</b> <b>This</b> ensures that the Cabinet is accountable not only to Parliament but also to the public, who have access to transcripts of Parliamentary debates.|$|E

25|$|After much <b>debate,</b> <b>this</b> {{occurred}} in 1947 with the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act. At {{the request of}} the New Zealand Parliament, Westminster passed the New Zealand Constitution (Amendment) Act 1947 to grant the New Zealand Parliament full sovereign powers to amend or repeal the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852. The Parliament of the United Kingdom could still pass laws at {{the request of the}} New Zealand Parliament, however. This residual power, which was used only for the 1947 Amendment Act, was abolished with the passing of the Constitution Act 1986, which repealed the 1852 Constitution Act.|$|E
25|$|The sixth Republican {{debate was}} held at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Florida, and was {{sponsored}} by Fox News Channel and Google.

The debate was only the second of the 2012 cycle to feature former governor Gary Johnson of New Mexico; he was also in the May 5, 2011 <b>debate.</b> <b>This</b> debate in particular was prominent as featuring the highest amount of candidates in attendance; out of the ten major Republican candidates for the Presidential nomination, only former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty was absent, as he had already dropped out of the race at this point in time.|$|E
25|$|He {{joined the}} CCF in 1934, during the Great Depression, and ran unsuccessfully for {{election}} to the Canadian House of Commons in the 1935 and 1940 federal elections and for the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1941 provincial election. He was first elected to the House of Commons in a 1942 by-election in Winnipeg North Centre that was held {{on the death of}} former CCF leader J.S. Woodsworth. He became an expert on parliamentary procedure, and used his skills to humiliate the Liberal government of Louis St. Laurent during the 1956 Pipeline <b>Debate.</b> <b>This</b> helped contribute to the government's electoral defeat in the 1957 election.|$|E

25|$|Grace was 50 {{years and}} 320 days old {{on the last}} day of the first Test. It says a lot about The Champion that he was still worth his place as a batsman. But he could no longer bend down, so his fielding was poor, and the Nottinghamshire crowd jeered and heckled him for it every time a ball went past him at point. Grace himself put it to the {{selection}} committee that he should be dropped for the second Test, and after some <b>debate</b> <b>this</b> is what happened. Only one man has played Test cricket at a greater age. He is Wilfred Rhodes, who coincidentally made his debut in the first Test.|$|E
25|$|Members of Congress enjoy {{parliamentary}} privilege, including {{freedom from}} arrest {{in all cases}} except for treason, felony, and breach of the peace and freedom of speech in <b>debate.</b> <b>This</b> constitutionally derived immunity applies to members during sessions and when traveling to and from sessions. The term arrest has been interpreted broadly, and includes any detention or delay {{in the course of}} law enforcement, including court summons and subpoenas. The rules of the House strictly guard this privilege; a member may not waive the privilege on their own, but must seek the permission of the whole house to do so. Senate rules, however, are less strict and permit individual senators to waive the privilege as they choose.|$|E
25|$|In Palestine, the station's {{influence}} is particularly strong. Recent polling indicates {{that in the}} West Bank and Gaza, Al Jazeera is the primary news source for an astounding 53.4 percent of Palestinian viewers. The second and third most watched channels, Palestine TV and Al Arabiya, poll a distant 12.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The result of Al Jazeera's market dominance {{is that it has}} itself become a mover and shaker in Palestinian politics, helping to craft public perceptions and influence the <b>debate.</b> <b>This</b> has obvious implications for the peace process: how Al Jazeera covers the deliberations and the outcome of any negotiated agreement with Israel will fundamentally shape how it is viewed—and, more importantly, whether it is accepted—by the Palestinian public.|$|E

25|$|In both Deuteronomy 23:3, and Zechariah 9:6, the Hebrew word mamzer is {{referenced}} {{alongside the}} nations of Ammon and Moab (in Deut 23:3), and the Philistine cities of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and Ashdod (in Zech 9:5–6). From such, Karaites have come to consider the most logical understanding of the Hebrew word mamzer, which modern Rabbinical Jews understand to refer to either children born from adultery or from incest (Talmud Bavli, Masekhet Yevamot), to actually speak of a nation or people. Karaites think that such an understanding fits perfectly into the context of both Deuteronomy 23 and Zechariah 9, (and {{this was also the}} understanding of the Rabbinist commentator Yehudah ben Shemu’el ibn Bil‘am). Several Medieval Rabbinite Jewish sages felt it necessary to <b>debate</b> <b>this</b> topic with Medieval Karaite Jewish sages.|$|E
25|$|Some {{conceive}} {{free will}} {{to be the}} capacity to make choices in which the outcome has not been determined by past events. Determinism suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with the existence of free will thus conceived. This problem has been identified in ancient Greek philosophy, and remains {{a major focus of}} philosophical <b>debate.</b> <b>This</b> view that conceives free will to be incompatible with determinism is called incompatibilism, and encompasses both metaphysical libertarianism, the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible, and hard determinism, the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible. It also encompasses hard incompatibilism, which holds not only determinism but also its negation to be incompatible with free will, and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.|$|E
25|$|Engineering {{problems}} {{made the}} 1,090-kilometre section crossing the Canadian Shield {{the most difficult}} leg of the TransCanada pipeline. Believing construction costs could make the line uneconomic, private sector sponsors refused to finance {{this portion of the}} line. Since the federal government wanted the line laid for nationalistic reasons, the reigning Liberals put a bill before Parliament to create a crown corporation to build and own the Canadian Shield portion of the line, leasing it back to TCPL. The government restricted debate on the bill in order to get construction underway by June, knowing that delays beyond that month would postpone the entire project a year. The use of closure created a furore which spilled out of Parliament and into the press. Known as the Great Pipeline <b>Debate,</b> <b>this</b> parliamentary episode contributed to the Louis St. Laurent government's defeat at the polls in 1957. But the bill passed and construction of the TransCanada pipeline began.|$|E
