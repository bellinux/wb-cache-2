5000|$|Feddis {{appeared}} on PBS’ NewsHour with <b>Jim</b> <b>Lehrer</b> <b>in</b> March 2011 {{to discuss the}} Fed's proposed rule regarding interchange. She said, [...] "Interchange is basically the merchants' contribution to creating this very valuable, available-24/7, reliable system. And that's how it started. It really was a merchant phenomenon. The merchants, or the businesses, were getting tired of the losses from when their checks were returned. So they basically agreed to pay the fee and shift those losses {{and the risk of}} those losses back to the bank. And that's what it amounts to. So, the fee covers the cost of providing this 24/7-available system. And it's reliable. It's quick. It's secure. It not only helps maintain it, but it helps improve it. That means innovation. And one of the great concerns here is that, if they don't have the money, you won't see any more innovation." ...|$|R

We have no option; {{we need to be}} successful and protect our strategic interests in the region; we need to set the Iraqi people up for self-reliance with their form of representative government that takes into account tribal, religious and ethnic complexity that has always defined Iraq. The Brits had a difficult time with that in the '10s and '20s of the last century; nothing new at all. And we must set the people of Iraq up for self-reliance so they can go on it on their own. I think we're going to be successful. There's nothing this country can't do, if we put our mind to it, but we need to do it right. We need to mobilize this country and employ a comprehensive regional and global strategy." [...] http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/military/jan-june06/iraq_4-13.html ...|$|R

However, the obsessive quest to control nuclear proliferation [...] particularly {{since the end of the}} Cold War [...] has enhanced the appeal of [...] or desperate desire for [...] nuclear weapons for some regimes. In addition, the quest has been a necessary cause of far more deaths than have been inflicted by all nuclear [...] or even all "weapons of mass destruction" [...] detonations in all of history. When asked by <b>Jim</b> <b>Lehrer</b> <b>in</b> their first presidential debate in September 2004 to designate the "single most serious threat to the national security to the United States, " the candidates had no difficulty agreeing on one. Concluded Lehrer, "So it's correct to say the single most serious threat you believe, both of you believe, is nuclear proliferation? " George W. Bush: "In the hands of a terrorist enemy. " John Kerry: "Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear proliferation.
