5|$|This {{could of}} course <b>have</b> <b>simply</b> been {{a case of}} Smuts's diffidence and reserve re-asserting itself {{in the face of}} new and {{unfamiliar}} surrounding; however Smuts's biographers almost universally ascribe it to the poverty Smuts endured during this first year.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Germanicus, Drusus {{was given}} a full funeral, and his body was interred in the Mausoleum of Augustus, {{alongside}} other deceased members of the imperial family. Like Germanicus, stories of poison abounded, with Sejanus as the murderer. Modern historians like Ronald Syme believe that he may <b>have</b> <b>simply</b> died of illness.|$|E
5|$|Additional live WeepingWillow17 videos {{are shown}} online, which police trace to a van in Union Square, where they find Willow and arrest Reggie. During interrogation, Reggie {{says he did}} not know Todd was really dead; he insists he fired a prop gun with blanks to scare Holden into {{splitting}} the money from the videos with them. Police soon learn the wadding from a blank was accidentally fired into Todd, and a horrified Reggie faces manslaughter charges. Willow, claiming to <b>have</b> <b>simply</b> been seeking fame as an actress, is released without criminal charges. The episode ends with Logan and Wheeler watching a video of Larry King interviewing Willow on a giant screen in Times Square.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Reyes was {{contacted}} by Doggett, now an FBI agent assigned to X-Files department, {{to assist in}} on a case involving the disappearances of several individuals {{who claimed to be}} alien abductees, as well as the disappearance of fellow agent Fox Mulder. Because of her background, Reyes considered that these believers may <b>have</b> <b>simply</b> formed a cult, but did not rule out the possibility of alien intervention. She stayed with the case until after Mulder was returned by his abductors, but returned to her field office soon after.|$|E
5|$|Small sized {{pterosaur}} species {{apparently were}} present in the Csehbánya Formation, indicating a higher diversity of Late Cretaceous pterosaurs than previously accounted for. The recent findings of a small cat-sized adult azhdarchid further indicate that small pterosaurs from the Late Cretaceous might actually <b>have</b> <b>simply</b> been rarely preserved in the fossil record, helped by {{the fact that there is}} a strong bias against terrestrial small sized vertebrates such as juvenile dinosaurs, and that their diversity might actually had been much larger than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|The {{extinction}} of megalodon {{set the stage}} for further changes in marine communities. The average body size of baleen whales increased significantly after its disappearance, although possibly due to other, climate-related, causes. Conversely however, the increase in baleen whale size {{may have contributed to the}} {{extinction of}} megalodon, as they may have preferred to go after smaller whales; bite marks on large whale species may have come from scavenging sharks. Megalodon may <b>have</b> <b>simply</b> become coextinct with smaller whale species, such as Piscobalaena nana. The extinction of megalodon had a positive impact on other apex predators of the time, such as the great white shark, in some cases spreading to regions where megalodon became absent.|$|E

5|$|A {{modified}} version of the spacecraft was proposed, which would have included a cargo module attached to the back of a modified equipment module. The spacecraft would have approached the station, and docked backwards using a port on the rear of the cargo module. If one of the forward docking configurations had been used for the Gemini itself, the docking would have been controlled remotely from the station, with the Gemini then separating from the cargo module and flying around the station to dock normally on a different port. The rear-docking Gemini would <b>have</b> <b>simply</b> remained attached to the cargo module, with the crew boarding the station through it. Its docking would have been controlled by its own crew, from a station {{at the back of the}} cargo module.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston may <b>have</b> <b>simply</b> {{been friends}} with a close working relationship. Contemporary chronicler {{comments}} are vaguely worded; Orleton's allegations were {{at least in part}} politically motivated, and are very similar to the highly politicised sodomy allegations made against Pope Boniface VIII and the Knights Templar in 1303 and 1308 respectively. Later accounts by chroniclers of Edward's activities may trace back to Orleton's original allegations, and were certainly adversely coloured by the events at the end of Edward's reign. Such historians as Michael Prestwich and Seymour Phillips have argued that the public nature of the English royal court would have made it unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet; neither the contemporary Church, Edward's father nor his father-in-law appear to have made any adverse comments about Edward's sexual behaviour.|$|E
5|$|However, {{during the}} 1980s, two Sun-observing {{satellites}} serendipitously discovered several {{new members of}} the Kreutz family, and since {{the launch of the}} SOHO Sun-observing satellite in 1995, it has been possible to observe comets very close to the Sun at any time of year. The satellite provides a constant view of the immediate solar vicinity, and SOHO has now discovered hundreds of new Sun-grazing comets, some just a few metres across. About 83% of the sungrazers found by SOHO are members of the Kreutz group, with the other being referred to as 'non-Kreutz' or 'sporadic' sungrazers (Meyer, Marsden, and Kracht1&2 families). On average, a new member of the Kreutz family is discovered every three days. Apart from Comet Lovejoy, none of the sungrazers seen by SOHO has survived its perihelion passage; some may have plunged into the Sun itself, but most are likely to <b>have</b> <b>simply</b> evaporated away completely.|$|E

5|$|Matilda had a younger, {{legitimate}} brother, William Adelin, and her father's {{relationships with}} numerous mistresses resulted in around 22 illegitimate siblings. Little {{is known about}} Matilda's earliest life, but she probably stayed with her mother, was taught to read, and was educated in religious morals. Among the nobles at her mother's court were her uncle David, later the King of Scotland, and aspiring nobles such as her half-brother Robert of Gloucester, her cousin Stephen of Blois and Brian Fitz Count. In 1108 Henry left Matilda and her brother {{in the care of}} Anselm, the Archbishop of Canterbury, while he travelled to Normandy; Anselm was a favoured cleric of Matilda's mother. There is no detailed description of Matilda's appearance; contemporaries described Matilda as being very beautiful, but this may <b>have</b> <b>simply</b> reflected the conventional practice among the chroniclers.|$|E
5|$|Penda's brother Eowa {{was also}} said by the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae {{to have been}} a king of the Mercians at the time of Maserfield. The {{question}} of what sort of relationship of power existed between the brothers before the battle is a matter of speculation. Eowa may <b>have</b> <b>simply</b> been a sub-king under Penda and {{it is also possible that}} Penda and Eowa ruled jointly during the 630s and early 640s: joint kingships were not uncommon among Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of the period. They may have ruled the southern and northern Mercians respectively. That Penda ruled the southern part is a possibility suggested by his early involvement in the area of the Hwicce, to the south of Mercia, as well as by the fact that, after Penda's death, his son Peada was allowed to rule southern Mercia while the northern part was placed under direct Northumbrian control.|$|E
5|$|Prime {{decides to}} send Verity {{and her two}} friends Hunter and Jimmy home. Ironhide and Sunstreaker are given this task, but the Machination strikes and {{seemingly}} destroy Sunstreaker and Hunter.

Megatron uses the Ore-13 {{to give him the}} rare ability of mass-displacement to transform into an earthen pistol, and decides to stay on Earth to escalate tensions, using a human facsimile to stir up a war between the United States and El Jira. The Autobots, with newly arrived allies, battle the Decepticons in the Russian breakaway state of Brasnya where the super-powered Megatron beats Prime to near death. Prime manages to recover and puts Megatron to flight. However, the facsimile Georgi Koska arrives dead at the Autobot base.|$|E
