5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cost of using that resource when {{measured in terms of}} what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E

These drugs were administered to rats in drinking water for two weeks. The contents of monoamines (DA and 5 HT) and their major metabolites(DOPAC, HVA and 5 HIAA) in eight discrete brain regions were measured by HPLC-ECD. After treatment with VP, DA levels <b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nucleus accumbens(N.

No significant change was shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> metabolites. 5 HT contents <b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> N.

HVA contents <b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> N. ACC and SCN, though they increased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> LH and SN. 5 HT levels <b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> N. ACC, SCN, AMY and RD.

DA was lowered more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> RD and HVA was lowered more in several regions by co-administration of VP and RES than by RES treatment alone. The well known locomotor hyperactivity induced by MAP was enhanced by VP. The present study suggests that {{there are at least two}} classes of voltage-gated calcium channels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central nervous system related to the release of monioamines, one sensitive to VP and other not.

The lumen-negative transepithelial voltage and the basolateral membrane voltage (VB) were <b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UUOOK, and increased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UUOCK. The transepithelial conductance (GT) was <b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> parallel with an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fractional apical membrane resistance (fRA) and a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> apical membrane conductance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UUOOK.
