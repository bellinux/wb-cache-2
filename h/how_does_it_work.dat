50|$|The viable systems {{approach}} proposes a deep {{analysis of the}} structure/systems dichotomy, proposing that every system represents a recognisable entity emerging from a specific changing structure (set of individual elements with assigned roles, activities and tasks performing in compliance with rules and constraints). Since a system originates from its structure, its evolution derives from the dynamic activation of static existing basic relationships. A structure can be studied (what it is? How it is made?), a system should only be interpreted (<b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>work?</b> What logics does it follow?)". This means that the static structure brings up the recognition of various possible systems dependant on the finalities and final goal; e.g., a human being is composed by many components assembled within a physical structure, but in the dynamic view man and women may be eating, sleeping, playing tennis or bridge, {{and all of these}} are different possible system behaviors.|$|E

40|$|Why do we {{say that}} {{democracy}} was born in Athens in the fifth century BC? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>work</b> that regime? What were the rights and duties of citizens? Because that experience was so important? The ancient Athenians {{were the first to}} ask these questions: For them democracy was not only a political regime, but a real way of life, the result of a long and often arduous journey, which culminated in the great victories of Marathon and Salamis. The Athenians, almost alone, defeated the armies of the Persian Empire, and from that time Athens was a model for all Greeks. Tracing the history of ancient Athens from the beginning until the conquests of Alexander the Great, this book is intended as an invitation for the curious reader, but not necessarily expert in ancient history to wonder about the origins of the oldest democracy and its values...|$|R

[...] (James 4.4) Kierkegaard puts it this way, [...] The expectancy of an eternal salvation will help a person to understand himself in temporality. … It is important as a guide in life, because temporal life is piecemeal and is like a dark saying that is best understood when it is understood little by little. Experience has the advantage of always having a goal by which it measures, a goal toward which it strives, and as it divides up the range of finitude it always knows how to measure out the particular, and as it proceeds from the certain it knows how to calculate the uncertain. It knows how to make a rough estimate, to determine the length of the way and of the time; it has a criterion for power and endurance, for resistance, for dangers and difficulties, and whether life enters in favorably or disturbingly, it knows how to cope with it accordingly; it is not easily caught napping, and if it is, it quickly rallies and measures again. Perhaps many a human life goes on in this way, actively engaged in the service of temporality, but also belonging totally to temporality. If, however, a person's soul is expecting an eternal salvation, this expectancy will no doubt disturb him momentarily, cause him to disdain experience, since its goal is too low for him, its criterion on too small a scale.

60|$|Mr. Max Mullet, {{looking on}} {{religion}} as {{the development of}} the sentiment of the Infinite, regards fetishism as a secondary and comparatively late form of belief. We find it, he observes, in various forms of Christianity; Christianity, therefore, is primary there, relic worship is secondary. Religion beginning, according to him, {{in the sense of the}} infinite, as awakened in man by tall trees, high hills, and so on, it advances to the infinite of space and sky, and so to the infinitely divine. This is primary: fetishism is secondary. Arguing elsewhere against this idea, I have asked: What was the modus of degeneration which produced similar results in Christianity, and in African and other religions? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>work?</b> I am not aware that Mr. Max Müller has answered this question.

40|$|Abstract: The European Union is {{promoting}} eCall {{to reduce the}} number of roadway fatalities by minimizing the response time when an accident has occurred. eCall is a combination of an In Vehicle System (IVS), a device with a GSM cell phone and GPS location capability, and a corresponding infrastructure of Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) Intelligent Vehicle Safety Systems use Information and Communications Technologies for providing solutions for improving road safety in particular in the pre-crash phase when the accident can still be avoided or at least its severity significantly reduced. With these systems, which can operate either autonomously on-board the vehicle, or be based on vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure communication (co-operative systems), the number of accidents and their severity can be reduced. Location-enhanced emergency calls like in-vehicle e-call have their primary benefit to society of saving lives and in offering an increased sense of security.
