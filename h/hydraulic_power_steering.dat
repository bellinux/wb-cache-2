2500|$|The Aura XR was the {{top-line}} Aura model. The XR {{was fitted}} with the 3.6L DOHC V6 with VVT, rated at [...] at 6200 rpm and [...] of torque at 3100 rpm. [...] This engine {{was first used}} in the Cadillac CTS {{as well as the}} Cadillac STS and marks its third use in a North American GM car. [...] With this 3.6L engine, the Aura was the first front-wheel drive GM passenger car to use the new Hydra-Matic 6T70 six-speed automatic transmission. The transmission featured TAPshift, which allowed the driver to manually select gears by using paddles located behind the steering wheel. [...] The Aura XR was the performance-oriented version with a taut, but not harsh, suspension and the more powerful engine. [...] Available interior colors in the XR were tan and grey leather (available in the XE), along with the XR-specific black or Morocco Brown leather. [...] Cloth was standard. [...] Other standard features included the Advanced Audio Package, 18inch alloy wheels, chrome exterior door handles, and remote vehicle start. Given the 2007 Saturn AURA's European rootsâ€”the car's chassis was also used for the Saab 9-3. The Aura also used <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> (V-6 models only) that provided more feedback and a more linear feel than the fussy electric power-assist units. For 2009, an entry level XR became available. [...] It included the 17 inch 10 spoke alloy wheels available on the XE and the 2.4 L LE5 Ecotec engine mated to GM's all new 6T40 6-speed automatic transmission with TAPshift. [...] The 3.6L VVT with 18" [...] wheels was optional.|$|E
2500|$|At a {{media event}} on February 28, 2011, Holden {{unveiled}} the Australian assembled Cruze sedan in facelifted [...] "Series II" [...] guise, {{otherwise known as}} the JH series. Prime Minister Julia Gillard attended the February launch to drive the first example off Holden's production line before full-scale production commenced in March. Holden has confirmed an initial local content level of between 40 and 50percent if assessed by retail value, with an aim of increasing Cruze localization over time. Series II styling revisions to the grille, lower air intake, and bumper have softened the front-end to bear a closer resemblance to Holden's larger VE II Commodore. Further differentiation from the original has been achieved via the fitment of amber front indicator lights, jewelled bezel headlamps, remodelled wheel trims, and through adjustments to the lower portion of the rear bumper. Carrying over largely unchanged is the 1.8-liter petrol inline-four, tweaked to yield slight enhancements in drivability. When automatic transmission is specified, the 1.8-liter is now teamed with GM's six-speed 6T30 unit, lighter and more compact than the previous 6T40. Diesel remains optional for [...] "CD" [...] and [...] "CDX" [...] specifications over the standard 1.8-liter petrol. Alterations to the 2.0-liter turbodiesel have resulted in an additional [...] and [...] and a slight reduction in fuel consumption for the manual variant, now a six-speed unit. However, the headline change is {{the release of the}} turbocharged 1.4-liter engine, dubbed iTi by Holden for intelligent turbo induction. The inclusion of the 1.4 also brings an upgrade to electric (as opposed to <b>hydraulic)</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> and affixes a Watt's linkage to the torsion beam rear suspension. Linked with six-speed manual or automatic transmissions, the 1.4 is fitted as standard to the new [...] "SRi" [...] and [...] "SRi-V" [...] sports-oriented trims, but is available at extra cost on the base [...] "CD". The new [...] "SRi" [...] and [...] "SRi-V" [...] models have their respective badges embossed onto the grille insert, are fitted with their own front bumper design, and feature side skirts, chrome exterior door handles, a rear lip spoiler, and five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels. Over the [...] "CD", [...] "SRi" [...] gains a leather-covered steering wheel rim and shift lever, with the [...] "SRi-V" [...] extending this upholstering to the seating. A heat function for the front seats, keyless entry with push-button engine start, reversing sensors, and seven-inch LCD multimedia unit are also part of the [...] "SRi-V" [...] equipment list. This multimedia system integrates satellite navigation, the CD and DVD players, and a 10GB internal hard disk drive. In mid-November 2011, Holden released the MY12 update to the Series II Cruze. This update coincided with the release of the hatchback body variant and saw Bluetooth telephone connectivity standard across the range.|$|E

50|$|The Olympia {{class was}} built in a {{transitional}} period for warship design and for the US Navy. The Navy was expanding its fleet to move beyond coastal defence onto the world stage. The Olympia was larger and faster than the previous generation of Navy ships, built with {{a new type of}} vertical triple expansion steam engine. Yet she retained a vestigial suit of sails for emergency propulsion. She {{was one of the first}} navy ships to have electricity, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>powered</b> <b>steering</b> gear and refrigeration. The Olympia class was also designed and constructed entirely inside the United States as per a stipulation by Congress. This was to force advances in United States industrial technology.

50|$|The Israeli {{company of}} Saymar have {{completed}} development {{and testing of}} a new automotive upgrade package for the Panhard M3. Saymar have replaced the old petrol engine with a more fuel-efficient Toyota 2L-T diesel engine developing 102 hp.

50|$|A <b>{{hydraulic}}</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> (HPS) uses {{hydraulic pressure}} supplied by an engine-driven pump {{to assist the}} motion of turning the steering wheel. Electric power steering (EPS) is more efficient than <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> since the electric power steering motor only needs to provide assistance when the steering wheel is turned, whereas the hydraulic pump must run constantly. In EPS, the amount of assistance is easily tunable to the vehicle type, road speed, and even driver preference. An added benefit is the elimination of environmental hazard posed by leakage and disposal of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> fluid. In addition, electrical assistance is not lost when the engine fails or stalls, whereas hydraulic assistance stops working if the engine stops, making the steering doubly heavy as the driver must now turn not only the very heavy steeringâ€”without any helpâ€”but also the power-assistance system itself.|$|E

40|$|Demands for {{including}} more {{functions such as}} haptic guiding in <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> systems in road vehicles have increased with requirements on new active safety and comfort systems. Active safety systems, which have been proven {{to have a positive}} effect on overall vehicle safety, refer to systems that give the driver assistance in more and less critical situations to avoid accidents. Active safety features are going to play an increasingly important roll in future safety strategies; therefore, it is essential that sub systems in road vehicles, such as <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> systems, are adjusted to meet new demands. The traditional <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Power</b> Assisted <b>Steering,</b> HPAS, system, cannot meet these new demands, due to the control unit's pure hydro-mechanical solution. The Active Pinion concept presented in this thesis is a novel concept for controlling the steering wheel torque in future active safety and comfort applications. The concept, which can be seen as a modular add-on added to a traditional HPAS system, introduces an additional degree of freedom to the control unit. Different control modes used to meet the demands of new functionality applications are presented and tested in a hardware-in-the-loop test rig. This thesis also covers various aspects of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> assisted <b>steering</b> systems in road vehicles. <b>Power</b> <b>steering</b> is viewed as a dynamic system and is investigated with linear and non-linear modeling techniques. The valve design in terms of area gradient is essential for the function of the HPAS system; therefore, a method involving optimization has been developed to determine the valve characteristic. The method uses static measurements as a base for calculation and optimization; the results are used in both linear and the non-linear models. With the help of the linear model, relevant transfer functions and the underlying control structure of the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> system have been derived and analyzed. The non-linear model has been used in concept validation of the Active Pinion. Apart from concept validation and controller design of the active pinion, the models have been roven effective to explain dynamic phenomena related to HPAS systems, such as the chattering phenomena and hydraulic lag. The printed version and the electronic version differ in that the electronic version contains two built in video films (see page 78 and page 89) ...|$|R

The characteristics from simulation and experiment of a test-rig show the steering feeling, and the two-facet control edge valve was designed for safer and friendly steering manipulation. The hydraulic pump pressure, determined {{as a function of}} the steering twist angle, is incorporated in the steering control valve characteristics.

40|$|The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> {{assisted}} <b>steering</b> (HPAS) {{system is}} one of the most sensitive vehicle interfaces to the driver perception. Comfort and performance parameters such as ride, handling, tactile transfer functions and overall noise levels are directly affected by its performance. The modeling of a HPAS system using the bond graph technique makes possible the combination of hydraulic and mechanical components. This allows physical and design variables such as fluid compressibility and hoses diameters to be evaluated simultaneously. HPAS should be used as a design and tuning tool to develop different system configurations before prototype test build, representing an improvement in terms of product development time and cost for both component and vehicle level...|$|R
