40|$|Starting {{with the}} Space Shuttle flight 4 A (Nov. 30, 2000), the International Space Station (ISS) power system employs large, high voltage, solar arrays with the {{negative}} ground tied to chassis. An intense study by a NASA sponsored Tiger Team {{in the early}} ‘ 90 s determined that this configuration leads to the structure being at a high negative potential relative to the local plasma (approximately 140 v negative without any intervention) and, that at any potential greater than around 70 v negative, the anodized aluminum structure and its components will undergo destructive arcing. A set of plasma contactor units (PCUs) was deployed to provide a conductive xenon plasma path for remitting electrons collected by the arrays and thus bring the potential closer to zero and mitigate the arcing danger.

40|$|Purpose - In {{new product}} {{development}} (NPD), {{changes to the}} initial designs are often proposed for on-going design projects due to new insights. These <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> belong {{to a wide range}} from incremental to radical and, in their impact, even to discontinuous change. Consequently, the actual workload of development projects confronted with <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> does not match the initial work estimates for the project's work packages. Accordingly, the intended timing of readiness of development projects in an NPD program will drift away. This timing is one of the causes of change propagation to other projects which results in even more <b>engineering</b> <b>changes.</b> For larger changes, the effects on timing may be disastrous. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to reveal the cause-and-effect relationships triggered by various types of changes and explain the need for a more integrated approach to managing <b>engineering</b> <b>change.</b> Design/methodology/approach - A longitudinal case study was performed at a leading microlithography manufacturing company, in which almost 20, 000 <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> were included. This study allowed the disclosure of the complexities of <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> management and provides guidelines for handling the resulting problems arising from managing these various types of change.

40|$|Many {{capital good}} firms deliver {{products}} that are not strictly one-off, but instead share {{a certain degree of}} similarity with other deliveries. In the delivery of the product, they aim to balance stability and variety in their product design and processes. The issue of <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> plays an important in how they manage to do so. Our aim is to gain more understanding into how capital good firms manage <b>engineering</b> <b>change,</b> design variety and process variety, and into the role of the product delivery strategies they thereby use. Product delivery strategies are defined as the type of engineering work that is done independent of an order and the specification freedom the customer has in the remaining part of the design. Based on the within-case and cross-case analysis of two capital good firms several mechanisms for managing <b>engineering</b> <b>change,</b> design variety and process variety are distilled. It was found that there exist different ways of (1) managing generic design information, (2) isolating large <b>engineering</b> <b>changes,</b> (3) managing process variety, (4) designing and executing <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> processes. Together with different product delivery strategies these mechanisms can be placed within an archetypes framework of <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> management. On one side of the spectrum capital good firms operate according to open product delivery strategies, have some practices in place to investigate design reuse potential, isolate discontinuous <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> into the first deliveries of the product, employ ‘probe and learn’ process management principles in order to allow evolving insights to be accurately executed and have informal <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> processes. On {{the other side of the}} spectrum capital good firms operate according to a closed product delivery strategy, focus on prevention of <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> based on design standards, need no isolation mechanisms for discontinuous <b>engineering</b> <b>changes,</b> have formal process management practices in place and make use of closed and formal <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> procedures. The framework should help managers to (1) analyze existing configurations of product delivery strategies, product and process designs and <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> management and (2) reconfigure any of these elements according to a ‘misfit’ derived from the framework.

This research examines the applicability of <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> management to a large steel manufacturing company who identified {{the lack of an}} <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> management system as the main contributing factor of numerous problems the company experienced over time. The study sets out to determine the high level understanding, the level- and sophistication of practical implementation and quality (identified problems with existing, or the lack of existing systems) of the <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> management procedures. The study also compared how three surveyed companies relate in terms of their <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> management systems and how the companies relate to the academic principals found in literature. Furthermore everyday user experience was measured to determine what aspects of <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> is important and what needed improvement As part of the research, literature was reviewed and it was found that various authors, practitioners and academics agreed that <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> management is increasingly important as an engineering management item. The literature revealed high-level requirements, models and constituents that are required for successful <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> management. A questionnaire survey was developed as the experiment to measure how <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> management was perceived practically. The aspects and phases listed from literature were examined and the perceptions, experience and feedback from the engineers that face <b>engineering</b> <b>changes</b> on a daily basis was determined. The general understanding and feeling towards their <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> management was analysed and used to identify areas of common problems. The two other surveyed companies: a petrochemical company and a specialised product company provided means to determine if the process of <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> management could be generalised and applied to the large steel manufacturing company. The analysis {{of the results of the}} survey provided valuable information that was used to conclude why some companies were able to achieve success with their <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> management procedures and why others failed or struggled. The research effectively showed how <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> management is perceived both negatively and positively in industry and identified common areas where improvement can be made. Furthermore, it can be concluded that <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> management remained generic from a high-level and would thus be applicable to the large steel manufacturing company.
