It enabled you to put out stuff that you liked without, in those days, having to worry about whether it was going to work commercially. I've never been a good business man.|$|E
500|$|In London, Grainger's charm, {{good looks}} and talent (with some {{assistance}} from the local Australian community) ensured that he was quickly taken up as a pianist by wealthy patrons, and was soon performing in concerts in private homes. The Times critic recorded after one such appearance that Grainger's playing [...] "revealed rare intelligence {{and a good deal}} of artistic insight". [...] In 1902 he was presented by the socialite Lillith Lowrey to Queen Alexandra, who thereafter frequently attended [...] his London recitals. Lowrey, 20 years Grainger's senior, traded patronage and contacts for sexual favours – he termed the relationship a [...] "love-serve job". She was the first woman with whom he had sex; he later wrote of this initial encounter that he had experienced [...] "an overpowering landslide" [...] of feeling, and that [...] "I thought I was about to die. If <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>correctly,</b> I only experienced fear of death. I don't think that any joy entered into it".|$|E

60|$|We {{have heard}} a {{discussion}} to-night on the disappearance of literature. That's no new thing. That's what certain kinds of literature have been doing for several years. The fact is, my friends, that the fashion in literature changes, and the literary tailors have to change their cuts or go out of business. Professor Winchester here, if <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> fairly <b>correctly</b> what he said, remarked that few, if any, of the novels produced to-day would live {{as long as the}} novels of Walter Scott. That may be his notion. Maybe he is right; but so far as I am concerned, I don't care if they don't.|$|R

60|$|If the English were {{accustomed}} {{to look at the}} foreign side of any international dispute, they might easily have satisfied themselves that there was very little danger of a war at that particular crisis, from the simple circumstance that their own Government had positively not an inch of honest ground to stand upon, and could not fail {{to be aware of the}} fact. Neither could they have met Parliament with any show of a justification for incurring war. It was no such perilous juncture as exists now, when law and right are really controverted on sustainable or plausible grounds, and a naval commander may at any moment fire off the first cannon of a terrible contest. If <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> it <b>correctly,</b> it was a mere diplomatic squabble, in which the British ministers, with the politic generosity which they are in the habit of showing towards their official subordinates, had tried to browbeat us for the purpose of sustaining an ambassador in an indefensible proceeding; and the American Government (for God had not denied us an administration of statesmen then) had retaliated with stanch courage and exquisite skill, putting inevitably a cruel mortification upon their opponents, but indulging them with no pretence whatever for active resentment.|$|R
2500|$|But that I didn’t {{appreciate}} {{the techniques of}} playwriting from just listening it was certainly kind of him and I certainly often went to his room to listen to and discuss drama. The following summer, July if <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>correctly,</b> I went as usual to visit him when Mr. Aston, laughing, said ‘similarly you don’t know about this person’s publications’ and showed me five books containing six volumes in temporary bindings which had been published. They, the Kawatake Mokuami script series, had been published as articles by the Ginza’s Kabuki Shinpō [...] (Kabuki News) Company. They covered ‘Nakamitsu’, ‘Four Thousand Ryō‘ (...)

His excrements nurture in the following an army of lesser fish, and for this reason, fishermen plumb after his resting place ... Gradually, Kraken ascends to the surface, and when he is at ten to twelve fathoms, the boats had better move out of his vicinity, as he will shortly thereafter burst up, like a floating island, spurting water from his dreadful nostrils and making ring waves around him, which can reach many miles.

2500|$|A {{great deal}} of the songs on the album were written over a two-year period by Love, Erlandson, and Schemel, in both Los Angeles as well as in a {{makeshift}} studio Love had set up at her and Cobain's secluded home in Carnation, Washington. Love also stated that [...] "half the fucking songs were written in the studio." [...] According to Love, the songwriting process for the album was [...] "really easy": [...] "We started at [...] Jabberjaw. I wrote [...] "Violet" [...] there. Then we moved to Seattle in the middle of that. [...] "Miss World" [...] was written in Seattle, if <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>correctly...</b> We had this great rehearsal space : It was just perfect, up on Capitol Hill, near the Urban Outfitters. Everyone got really close. There was just a great flow." [...] Love also stated that she had been listening to The Breeders, Pixies, Echo and the Bunnymen, and Joy Division while recording the album, and that their work had acted as primary influences on her at the time.|$|E

40|$|The {{assumption}} that cognitive processes {{are independent of}} handedness was questioned. Five experiments with left-handed and right-handed participants centered on investigating recognition memory for the orientation of heads. Their results provided consistent evidence of a general contralateral handedness effect: Left-facing heads {{are more likely to}} be <b>remembered</b> <b>correctly</b> by right-handed participants, whereas right-facing heads {{are more likely to be}} <b>remembered</b> <b>correctly</b> by left-handed participants. Motor imagery and hemispheric differences explanations were compared. The results supported the hypothesis that the effect is a consequence of differences between handedness groups in terms of specific patterns of underlying motor activation rather than in terms of more general differences in function between cerebral hemispheres. The possibility of a chiral psychology of cognition that takes note of a person's handedness is considered...|$|R
2500|$|On {{the pyramid}} it is {{declared}} in Egyptian writing {{how much was}} spent on radishes and onions and leeks for the workmen, and if <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>correctly</b> what the interpreter said while reading this inscription for me, a sum of 1600 silver talents was spent. Kheops moreover came to such a pitch of evilness, that being in want of money he sent his own daughter to a brothel and ordered her to obtain from those who came {{a certain amount of}} money (how much it was they did not tell me). But she not only obtained the sum that was appointed by her father, but she also formed a design for herself privately to leave behind her a memorial: She requested each man who came in to her to give her one stone for her building project. And of these stones, they told me, the pyramid was built which stands in front of the great pyramid in the middle of the three, each side being 150feet in length." ...|$|E
2500|$|For scenes where Peyton {{is drawing}} or painting, Ward stated, [...] "...there {{would likely be}} very light lines for her to follow. Often I would give a {{finished}} version and an unfinished for this purpose. If <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>correctly,</b> it was usually the words that I left undone." [...] Regarding the evolution of Peyton's artwork over the years, she said, [...] "I {{look back at the}} first season and think the drawings are awful! I certainly became more comfortable working in her style, but I think her style also evolved to fit mine. Does that make sense?" [...] Ward clarified, [...] "Initially I was trying to do something that just didn’t flow well from me. The drawings were too clean. A little forced and not at all the way I liked to work." [...] Ward said that as the show progressed, she began to put more of my own style in them, and became more comfortable and the work got better. In Season 3, the artwork was promoted through the album Friends with Benefit. In Season 6, it is seen in color instead of in black and white, to reflect the character's happiness.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When I entered, the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I went over and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>correctly.</b> The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E
