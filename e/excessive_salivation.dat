25|$|Four {{recognised}} species infect cattle: S. bovifelis, S. bovihominis (S. hominis) S. cruzi (S. bovicanis) and S. hirsuta. S. cruzi is {{the only}} species known to be pathogenic in cattle. A number of clinical syndromes {{have been reported in}} connection with this parasite: eosinophilic myositis; abortions, stillbirths and deaths in pregnant cows; two cases of necrotic encephalitis in heifers have also been reported. Typical clinical signs of acute bovine sarcocystosis are: anorexia, pyrexia (42C or more), anemia, cachexia, enlarged palpable lymph nodes, <b>excessive</b> <b>salivation</b> and loss of hair {{at the tip of the}} tail.|$|E
40|$|Non-traumatic {{rhabdomyolysis}} {{associated with}} organophosphate intoxication {{has not been}} generally reported. We report here in a severe case of fenitrothion poisoning complicated by rhabdomyolysis. A 43 -year-old woman ingested approximately 100 ml of fenitrothion emulsion (50 %) {{in an attempt to}} commit suicide. On day 3 after admission, her creatine phosphokinase (CPK) peaked at 47, 762 IU/L. She received supportive treatment included sodium bicarbonate and fluid resuscitation. However, muscarinic symptoms including <b>excessive</b> miosis and <b>salivation</b> developed on day 5 when her CPK levels decreased. The delay in cholinergic symptoms might have been due to the trihexyphenidyl she took with the antipsychotic drugs. Fortunately, the present patient recovered from the acute cholinergic crisis, and acute renal failure was prevented by early diagnosis. This is a case of organophosphate poisoning complicated by rhabdomyolysis in a psychiatric patient. The masking of acute cholinergic symptoms should be taken into consideration in such patients. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the hematological and serum biochemical parameters in buffaloes and cows infected with {{foot and mouth disease}} (FMD) virus. Forty buffaloes and cows (6 months - 2 years old) were used. Twenty buffaloes and cows clinically healthy and were used as control, the other twenty buffaloes and cows showed characteristic clinical signs of FMD. Blood samples were collected and serum was separated from both groups to measure the hematological and biochemical parameters. Infected buffaloes and cows showed fever, anroxia, <b>excessive</b> foamy <b>salivation</b> and ulcer formation in the mouth. Compared to the control buffaloes, erythrocytic count (RBCs), hemoglobin (Hb) and packed cell volume (PCV) in the FMD infected buffaloes were significantly decreased, while mean corpascular hemoglobin (MCH) was significantly increased. In addition, significant increase in toltal leukocyte count (TLC), neutrophils, with a significant decrease in eosinophil and lymphocyte counts were observed. Moreover, cows infected with FMD virus showed no significant changes in the erythrogram, while, significant increases in TLC and neutrophils, with a significant decrease in eosinophil and lymphocyte counts were observed when compared with the control group. There were significant decreases in the levels of serum total proteins, albumin and globulin, while serum asprtate transferase (AST), creatinine phospho-kinase (CPK), glucose and cortisol levels were significantly increased in the infected animals. Tissue and saliva specimens were collected and analyzed by using universal primer using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All the identified viruses were of serotype ‘O’. It is concluded that FMDV serotype ‘O’ is circulating among cows and buffaloes in the study area...|$|R
50|$|Muscarine {{poisoning}} {{is characterized}} by miosis, blurred vision, increased <b>salivation,</b> <b>excessive</b> sweating, lacrimation, bronchial secretions, bronchoconstriction, bradycardia, abdominal cramping, increased gastric acid secretion, diarrhea and polyuria. If muscarine reaches the brain it can cause tremor, convulsions and hypothermia.Cardiac ventricles contain muscarinic receptors that mediate {{a decrease in the}} force of contractions leading to a lower blood pressure. If muscarine is administered intravenously, muscarine can trigger acute circulatory failure with cardiac arrest.The symptoms of intoxication with mushrooms rich in muscarine, especially Inocybe, are very typical:The symptoms start early, after one-quarter to two hours, with headache, nausea, vomiting, and constriction of the pharynx. Then salivation, lacrimation, and diffuse perspiration set in, combined with miosis, disturbed accommodation, and reduced vision. Gastric and small bowel colic leads to diarrhea, and there is a painful urge for urination. Bronchoconstriction leads to asthmatic attacks and severe dyspnea, and bradycardia combined with marked hypotension and vasodilation results in circulatory shock. Death after 8 to 9 hours has been reported in about 5% of the cases, but can be avoided completely by prompt diagnosis and treatment with atropine.|$|R
25|$|Intestinal gas is {{composed}} of varying quantities of exogenous sources and endogenous sources. The exogenous gases are swallowed (aerophagia) when eating or drinking or increased swallowing during times of <b>excessive</b> <b>salivation</b> (as might occur when nauseated or {{as the result of}} gastroesophageal reflux disease). The endogenous gases are produced either as a by-product of digesting certain types of food, or of incomplete digestion, as is the case during steatorrhea. Anything that causes food to be incompletely digested by the stomach or small intestine may cause flatulence when the material arrives in the large intestine, due to fermentation by yeast or prokaryotes normally or abnormally present in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of exposure include: nervousness/restlessness, miosis (contraction of the pupil), rhinorrhea (runny nose), <b>excessive</b> <b>salivation,</b> dyspnea (difficulty in breathing due to bronchoconstriction/secretions), sweating, bradycardia (slow heartbeat), loss of consciousness, convulsions, flaccid paralysis, loss of bladder and bowel control, apnea (breathing stopped) and lung blisters. The exact {{symptoms of}} overexposure {{are similar to}} those created by all nerve agents. Tabun is toxic even in minute doses. The number and severity of symptoms which appear vary according to the amount of the agent absorbed and rate of entry of it into the body. Very small skin dosages sometimes cause local sweating and tremors accompanied with characteristically constricted pupils with few other effects. Tabun is about half as toxic as sarin by inhalation, but in very low concentrations it is more irritating to the eyes than sarin. Also, tabun breaks down slowly, which after repeated exposure can lead to build up in the body.|$|E

40|$|Methyl {{parathion}} - MP (C 8 H 10 NO 5 PS) is a restricted-use pesticide {{that has}} been widely used as an agricultural insecticide. It belongs to the class of organophosphate chemicals characterized by their ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity. The main {{route of human exposure}} is inhalation, but dermal contact and inadvertent ingestion can also be substantial. Populations that are susceptible to MP exposure primarily are applicators, manufacturers and individuals living near application and/or disposal sites. Exposure has also been reported as a result of illegal indoor application. MP related health effects include headaches, nausea, night-waking, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, <b>excessive</b> sweating and <b>salivation,</b> incoordination, and mental confusion. Other symptoms including behavior problems, motor skill problems and impairment of memory recall have also been reported. The primary targets of toxicity are the hematopoietic system (serum cholinesterase inhibition), the cardiovascular system (cardiovascular lesions, abnormalities in heart rate and increase in heart-to-body ratio), the reproductive system (placental morphology, fibrosis and hemorrhage, and inhibition of DNA synthesis in seminiferous tubules), and the nervous system (headache, muscle weakness, insomnia, dizziness, and impaired memory). MP is believed to not have any carcinogenic effects. In an attempt to update its toxicologic profile, we hereby provide a critical review of MP-related environmental and toxicologic effects, with a special emphasis on their potential implications for public health...|$|R
40|$|Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin protein {{produced}} by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Being {{one of the most}} poisonous naturally occurring substances and the most toxic protein, it {{has become one of the}} most widely used and most effective therapeutic agents ever invented. Botulinium toxin type A was first used in human strabismus in 1980. In less than three decades, its applications have expanded greatly. Nowadays it is used to treat all kinds of dystonic or non-dystonic muscle spasm, sphincter problems, headache, <b>excessive</b> sweating or <b>salivation,</b> spasticity of all sorts, and facial wrinkles. Dystonia has been the first movement disorder treated with botulinum toxin. However, the use of botulinum toxin has encompassed many other hyperkinetic movement disorders, such as tremor, tics, tardive dyskinesias, and bruxism. This tremendous explosion in the use of botulinum toxin is attributed to its effectiveness and relative lack of severe side-effects. For this agent, the discovery of new and novel uses is limited only by our own creativity. During clinical practice, it is advisable to keep some points in mind before commencing botulinum toxin treatment. The principal symptom being targeted should be clear. For example, is botulinum toxin given to relieve pain, or to correct abnormal posture, or both? Muscles that are principally causing the symptom(s) are then identified. A sufficient dose should be injected into each muscle. The main goal of botulinum toxin injection is to maximise benefit and to limit potentia...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Belgian {{shepherd}} Groenendael and Tervueren {{is believed}} to be at higher risk of developing epilepsy than dogs of the common population. This epidemiological study was designed to estimate the prevalence of epilepsy in the Danish population of Groenendael and Tervueren born between 1995 and 2004. Furthermore, it was the intention to describe the clinical manifestation (seizure types and phenomenology) of epilepsy and to identify risk factors for euthanasia once the dog was diagnosed as having epilepsy. Methods All owners of Groenendael and Tervueren dogs born between January 1995 and December 2004 and registered in the Danish Kennel Club (1, 248 dogs) were contacted and asked to answer a mailed questionnaire concerning epilepsy. Positive responders were subsequently validated in a follow-up interview conducted by telephone using a standardized questionnaire. Owners were questioned about age at first seizure, seizure frequency, seizure duration, a detailed description of seizure phenomenology, post-ictal signs and if a veterinarian had diagnosed the dog with epilepsy. Results Prevalence of epilepsy was estimated at 9. 5 %. Mean age of epilepsy debut was 3. 3 years (range 0. 5 – 8. 0 years). There was an almost equal number of Groenendael (25) and Tervueren (24). The distribution of females and males was 31 and 18 respectively. Twenty-five per cent experienced focal seizures, 53 % experienced focal seizures with secondary generalization and 18 % experienced primary generalized seizures. In four percent seizures were unclassifiable. The most commonly reported focal seizure phenomenology included ataxia, crawling, swaying, fearful behavior, <b>salivation,</b> <b>excessive</b> attention seeking and disorientation. In 16 % of the cases, epilepsy led to euthanasia. Intact dogs with epilepsy had a significantly increased risk of being euthanized because of epilepsy compared to neutered dogs with epilepsy. In 22 % of the cases the owners reported that anxiety/hyperactivity/stress could act as a seizure provoking factor. Conclusion A high prevalence of epilepsy appears to be present in the Danish Groenendael and Tervueren population. The relatively late debut age of epilepsy in this breed contributes greatly to the increased prevalence of epileptic individuals, because dogs developing epilepsy late in life are used for breeding unintended. </p...|$|R

2500|$|In 1810, two British ships, HMS Triumph and , {{salvaged}} a {{large load}} of elemental mercury from a wrecked Spanish vessel near Cadiz, Spain. The bladders containing the mercury soon ruptured. The element spread about the ships in liquid and vapor forms. [...] The sailors presented with neurologic compromises: tremor, paralysis, and <b>excessive</b> <b>salivation</b> {{as well as}} tooth loss, skin problems, and pulmonary complaints. [...] In 1823 William Burnet, MD published {{a report on the}} effects of Mercurial vapor. [...] The Triumph’s surgeon, Henry Plowman, had concluded that the ailments had arisen from inhaling the mercurialized atmosphere. [...] His treatment was to order the lower deck gun ports to be opened, when it was safe to do so; sleeping on the orlop was forbidden; and no men slept in the lower deck if they were at all symptomatic. Windsails were set to channel fresh air into the lower decks day and night.|$|E
2500|$|Though it {{does not}} enter torpor, E. wahlbergi is heterothermic, {{lowering}} its core body temperature while roosting. [...] In winter, this heterothermy is more pronounced. [...] Portions of the geographic range of E. wahlbergi incur the largest seasonal temperature variations of the entire Afrotropical region. [...] Metabolic rates increase up to 30% during the winter as compared to summer, allowing individuals to overcome heat loss in lower ambient temperatures. [...] Body mass also increases in winter. [...] An individual's thermoneutral zone may also be broader in the winter than in the summer, allowing a greater temperature tolerance and thus decreasing energy expenditure typically used to compensate for minor changes in core body temperature. [...] In times of heat stress, <b>excessive</b> <b>salivation,</b> wing fanning, body licking, and panting help to lower body temperature. [...] Some individuals are intolerant of extreme heat and die at temperatures greater than 40°C (104°F).|$|E
40|$|Mild {{strains of}} the virus of herpes are {{described}} the action of which tends to be confined and local. Unless, therefore, these mild strains are injected intracranially they do not tend to produce virus encephalitis in the rabbit. Recovery from infection with the mild strains confers immunity to virulent {{strains of the}} herpes and allied viruses. Long glycerolation reduces the number of viable organisms. This loss among the mild strains may reduce the virus below the strength required for an effective extracranial although not below the strength needed for an intracranial inoculation. Herpes virus carriage in man, even under highly favorable conditions, is difficult of detection by means of rabbit inoculation. The detection may be achieved by intracranial when it cannot be accomplished by intracorneal inoculation. The virus producing encephalitis in the rabbit attaches itself chiefly to and multiplies in {{the substance of the}} central nervous system. Hence its detection in the cerebrospinal fluid is rarely accomplished. When the inoculation of the virus is made intracranially and especially when the inoculum is composed of active brain tissue, the virus is discoverable in the cerebrospinal fluid by rabbit inoculation much more frequently than when the virus encephalitis follows an extracranial variety of infection. The herpes virus is capable of excretion by the kidney of the rabbit and of being detected in the urine by rabbit inoculation. Among the rarer symptoms of virus encephalitis is <b>excessive</b> lacrimation. While <b>salivation</b> is frequent, lacrimation is exceptional. A comparison of the Levaditi, Doerr, and Goodpasture strains of virus indicates the first to be of medium, the second of mild, and the third of high degree of neurotropic activity. The Doerr strain resembles the mild herpes strains described in this paper. The Goodpasture virus, while exceeding the Levaditi strain in affinity for the central nervous system, falls below the H. F. strain in this regard. Neutralization of virus by the serum of infected and recovered rabbits takes place regularly within certain quantitative limits. Neutralization with human serum is inconstant and capricious and without demonstrable relation to previous attacks of epidemic encephalitis. Comparison of the clinical types of encephalitis as presented by the epidemic variety in man and the experimental virus variety in rabbits brings out certain correspondences and certain differences. It is only in partial and essentially superficial aspects that the two diseases can be identified one with the other...|$|R

Less commonly, they may lead to blindness and paralysis. The length of the systemic disease may be as short as 10 days, or the start of neurological signs may not come until several weeks or months later.
