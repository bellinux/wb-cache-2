40|$|This study {{provides}} insight into employee retention issues in owner-operated small <b>hospitality</b> <b>businesses</b> {{in a university}} town. The study found that even though employee retention represents a managerial issue for the small <b>hospitality</b> <b>businesses,</b> it is not of significant importance to them. The restaurant managers/owners did employ various retention strategies for providing a good organizational culture but still accepted the transient nature of the student workforce. The findings suggest employee retention strategies to keep student employees while they study in the town's university. The paper also recommends the need for small <b>hospitality</b> <b>businesses</b> {{to work closely with}} hospitality education institutions to form a closer link between study and part-time employment, for example through internship, to alleviate the inherent problems of the transient nature of the student workforce. The paper provides the first major study in the New Zealand context, providing new insights into understanding employee retention among student workers in small <b>hospitality</b> <b>businesses...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{alternate}} framework for evaluating strategic decisions of <b>hospitality</b> <b>businesses</b> in developing nations, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). While strategy literature is extensive and diverse, it remains focused on developed nation contexts. By default, so is the case with hospitality strategy literature. This has created a paucity of research for <b>hospitality</b> <b>businesses</b> in developing nations; these businesses are largely SMEs in dynamic environments seldom similar to the ones in developed nations. Therefore, the proposed framework emphasizes the role of environment, and its relationship to strategic choice, resource allocation, and strategy evaluation.
