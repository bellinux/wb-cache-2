5|$|Because sugars burn easily {{when exposed}} to flame, the {{handling}} of sugars risks dust explosion. The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed most of the refinery, {{was caused by the}} ignition of sugar dust. In its culinary use, sugar that is exposed to a heat source causes caramelization to take place. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as <b>diacetyl</b> are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.|$|E
5|$|Schneider {{left the}} St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2005, {{arriving}} at the Baltimore Sun. While at the Sun, he began an investigative series into the use of <b>diacetyl</b> as a food flavoring for consumer products like microwave popcorn. The chemical {{was found to have}} been causing lung-related diseases in workers at plants, including Bronchiolitis obliterans ("popcorn lung"), and, according to Schneider, put professional cooks at risk. The investigation resulted in greater recognition of diacetyl's hazards by the public, resulting in a reduction or elimination in its use by manufacturers like ConAgra.|$|E
25|$|With wines {{that have}} {{excessive}} levels of <b>diacetyl,</b> some winemakers use sulfur dioxide to bind with the compound {{and reduce the}} perception of <b>diacetyl</b> by 30 to 60%. This binding is a reversible process and {{after only a few}} weeks aging in the bottle or tank, the high levels of <b>diacetyl</b> return. However, sulfur dioxide added earlier in the malolactic fermentation process limits <b>diacetyl</b> production by inhibiting the bacteria and limiting their activity in its entirety, including the conversion of malic to lactic acid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diacetyl</b> can be {{produced}} by the LAB through metabolism of sugar or of citric acid. While citric acid is naturally present in grapes, {{it is in a}} very small amount with most of it coming from deliberate addition by the winemaker to acidify the wine. In the presence of both malic and citric acids, the LAB use both, but use the malic much more quickly, with the rate of citric use/diacetyl formation influenced by the particular bacterial strain (with most strains of O. oeni producing less <b>diacetyl</b> than Lactobacillus and Pediococcis species), as well as the redox potential of the wine. In wine conditions that have a low redox potential (meaning it is more oxidative such as in a barrel that is not fully topped up), more citric acid will be consumed and <b>diacetyl</b> formed. In more reductive conditions, such as in alcoholic fermentations where yeast populations are at their peak and the wine is heavily saturated with carbon dioxide, the formation of <b>diacetyl</b> is much slower. The yeasts also help keep levels low by consuming <b>diacetyl</b> and reducing it to acetoin and butylene glycol.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diacetyl</b> in wine is {{produced}} by lactic acid bacteria, mainly Oenococcus oeni. In low levels it can impart positive nutty or caramel characters, however at levels above 5mg/L it creates an intense buttery or butterscotch flavour, where it {{is perceived as a}} flaw. The sensory threshold for the compound can vary depending on the levels of certain wine components, such as sulfur dioxide. It can be produced as a metabolite of citric acid when all of the malic acid has been consumed. <b>Diacetyl</b> rarely taints wine to levels where it becomes undrinkable.|$|E
25|$|The {{diketone}} <b>diacetyl</b> (2,3-butanedione) has a buttery aroma and {{is present}} in almost all distilled beverages. Whiskies and cognacs typically contain more of this than vodkas, but significantly less than rums or brandies.|$|E
25|$|The {{molecular}} {{composition of}} butter which contribute to butter's distinct flavor includes: fatty acids, lactones, methyl ketones, <b>diacetyl</b> and dimethyl sulfide. When foods containing butter are baked, {{the concentrations of}} methyl ketones and lactones increase to provide the flavor of butter.|$|E
25|$|The main {{products}} of malolactic fermentation are lactic acid, <b>diacetyl,</b> acetic acid, acetoin, and various esters. The amount and {{exact nature of}} these products depends on the species/strain of LAB conducting the malolactic fermentation and the condition influencing that wine (pH, available nutrients, oxygen levels, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Commercial {{butter is}} about 80% {{butterfat}} and 15% water; traditionally made butter may have {{as little as}} 65% fat and 30% water. Butterfat {{is a mixture of}} triglyceride, a triester derived from glycerol and three of any of several fatty acid groups. Butter becomes rancid when these chains break down into smaller components, like butyric acid and <b>diacetyl.</b> The density of butter is 0.911g/cm3 (0.527oz/in3), about the same as ice.|$|E
25|$|Although oak barrels {{have long}} been used by winemakers, many wineries now use oak wood chips for aging wine more quickly and also adding desired woody aromas along with vanilla flavors. It is a common {{misconception}} that oak imparts butter flavors to wine. This is not so. The butter flavors come from lactic acid, naturally present in the wine, converted during malolactic fermentation to <b>diacetyl.</b> This process reverses itself, although the addition of sulfur dioxide prevents this, and the <b>diacetyl</b> remains. Oak chips can be added during fermentation or during aging. In the latter case, they are generally placed into fabric sacks and placed into the aging wine. The diversity of chips available gives winemakers numerous options. Oak chips {{have the benefit of}} imparting intense oak flavoring {{in a matter of weeks}} while traditional oak barrels would need a year or more to convey similar intensity. Critics claim that the oak flavoring from chips tend to be one-dimensional and skewed towards the vanilla extract with the wines still lacking some of the physical benefits that barrel oak imparts. The use of oak powder is also less common than chips, although they are a very practical alternative if oak character is to be introduced during fermentation. Oak planks or staves are sometimes used, either during fermentation or aging. Wines made from these barrel alternatives typically do not age as well as wines that are matured in barrels. Improvements in micro-oxygenation have allowed winemakers to better mimic the gentle aeration of oak barrels in stainless steel tanks with oak chips.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacteria}} {{behind this}} {{process can be}} found naturally in the winery, in cooperages, which make oak wine barrels that will house a population of the bacteria or they can be introduced by the winemaker with a cultured specimen. For some wines, the conversion of malic into lactic acid can be beneficial, especially if the wine has excessive levels of malic acid. For other wines, such as Chenin blanc and Riesling, it produces off flavors in the wine (such as the buttery smell of <b>diacetyl)</b> {{that would not be}} appealing for that variety. In general, red wines are more often put through MLF than whites, which means a higher likelihood of finding malic acid in white wines (though notable exceptions, such as oaked Chardonnay, are often put through MLF).|$|E
25|$|Morphine is {{a highly}} {{addictive}} substance. In controlled studies comparing the physiological and subjective effects of heroin and morphine in individuals formerly addicted to opiates, subjects showed no preference for one drug over the other. Equipotent, injected doses had comparable action courses, with no difference in subjects' self-rated feelings of euphoria, ambition, nervousness, relaxation, drowsiness, or sleepiness. Short-term addiction studies by the same researchers demonstrated that tolerance developed at a similar rate to both heroin and morphine. When compared to the opioids hydromorphone, fentanyl, oxycodone, and pethidine/meperidine, former addicts showed a strong preference for heroin and morphine, suggesting that heroin and morphine are particularly susceptible to abuse and addiction. Morphine and heroin were also {{much more likely to}} produce euphoria and other positive subjective effects when compared to these other opioids. The choice of heroin and morphine over other opioids by former drug addicts may also be because heroin (also known as morphine diacetate, diamorphine, or <b>diacetyl</b> morphine) is an ester of morphine and a morphine prodrug, essentially meaning they are identical drugs in vivo. Heroin is converted to morphine before binding to the opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, where morphine causes the subjective effects, which is what the addicted individuals are seeking.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Diacetyl</b> {{production}} is favored in fermentations that run warm with temperatures between 18°C (64.4°F) and 25°C (77°F). It {{also tends to}} be produced at higher levels in wines with lower pH levels (under 3.5), though at levels below 3.2, most strains of LAB desirable for MLF tend to be inhibited. [...] "Wild" [...] (as in uninoculated) malolactic ferments {{have the potential to}} produce more <b>diacetyl</b> than inoculated ferments due to the lower initial populations during the lag phase with inoculated ferments usually having an initial inoculum of 106 CFU/ml. Late MLF inoculations, after alcoholic fermentation, also tend to produce higher levels of <b>diacetyl.</b> Chardonnay producers desiring to make the high-diacetyl [...] "buttery style" [...] will often do late or [...] "wild" [...] inoculation in the barrel after primary fermentation, allowing the wine to spend several weeks or even months sur lie in reductive conditions that promote <b>diacetyl</b> production. Some sources point out that <b>diacetyl</b> is actually decreased by sur lie, due to surviving yeast metabolizing <b>diacetyl,</b> and therefore malolactic fermentation is best performed apart from lees.|$|E
2500|$|Fusel oils– Formed by the {{decomposition}} of amino acids by the yeast. This includes 2,3-Butanediol which is formed by yeast-consuming <b>diacetyl,</b> the compound that gives Chardonnay and other wines a [...] "buttery" [...] aroma, reducing it first to acetoin {{and then to}} the more neutral-smelling 2,3-Butanediol. Many beer and winemakers who have a wine with too much [...] "butteriness" [...] will often [...] "pitch" [...] fresh yeast cultures into the no longer fermenting tank so that the yeast will consume the <b>diacetyl</b> and reduce the aroma.|$|E
2500|$|Urea {{is readily}} {{quantified}} {{by a number}} of different methods, such as the <b>diacetyl</b> monoxime colorimetric method, and the Berthelot reaction (after initial conversion of urea to ammonia via urease). [...] These methods are amenable to high throughput instrumentation, such as automated flow injection analyzers and 96-well micro-plate spectrophotometers.|$|E
2500|$|Microwaveable popcorn {{represents}} a special case, {{since it is}} designed to be cooked along with its various flavoring agents. One of these formerly common artificial-butter flavorants, <b>diacetyl,</b> has been implicated in causing respiratory illnesses in microwave popcorn factory workers, also known as [...] "popcorn lung." [...] Major manufacturers in the United States have stopped using this chemical, including: Orville Redenbacher's, Act II, Pop Secret and Jolly Time.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Diacetyl</b> (or 2,3-butanedione) is the {{compound}} {{associated with the}} [...] "buttery" [...] aromas of Chardonnays, but it can affect any wine that has gone through malolactic fermentation. At an odor detection threshold of 0.2mg/l in white wines and 2.8mg/l in red wines, it can be perceived as slightly buttery or [...] "nutty" [...] while at concentrations greater than 5 to 7mg/l (5-7 ppm) can overwhelm other aroma notes in the wine.|$|E
2500|$|Most Pediococcus {{species are}} {{undesirable}} in winemaking {{due to the}} high levels of <b>diacetyl</b> that can be produced, as well as increased production of biogenic amines that has been implicated as one potential cause for red wine headaches. Many species of Pediococcus also have the potential to introduce off odors or other wine faults to the wine such as the bitter-tasting [...] "acrolein taint" [...] that comes from degradation of glycerol into acrolein which then reacts with phenolic compounds in the wine to produce a bitter-tasting compound.|$|E
2500|$|Malolactic {{fermentation}} (also {{known as}} malolactic conversion or MLF) {{is a process}} in winemaking in which tart-tasting malic acid, naturally present in grape must, is converted to softer-tasting lactic acid. Malolactic fermentation is most often performed as a secondary fermentation shortly {{after the end of}} the primary fermentation, but can sometimes run concurrently with it. The process is standard for most red wine production and common for some white grape varieties such as Chardonnay, where it can impart a [...] "buttery" [...] flavor from <b>diacetyl,</b> a byproduct of the reaction.|$|E
2500|$|Before modern factory butter making, cream {{was usually}} {{collected}} from several milkings {{and was therefore}} several days old and somewhat fermented {{by the time it}} was made into butter. Butter made from a fermented cream is known as cultured butter. During fermentation, the cream naturally sours as bacteria convert milk sugars into lactic acid. The fermentation process produces additional aroma compounds, including <b>diacetyl,</b> which makes for a fuller-flavored and more [...] "buttery" [...] tasting product. Today, cultured butter is usually made from pasteurized cream whose fermentation is produced by the introduction of Lactococcus and Leuconostoc bacteria.|$|E
2500|$|Heterofermenting {{species from}} the Lactobacillus genus, {{as well as}} some wild strains of O. oeni, have the {{potential}} to metabolize fructose (one of the main sugars in wine) into the sugar alcohols mannitol and (less commonly) erythritol. These are sweet-tasting compounds can add sweetness to a wine where it is not desired (such as Cabernet Sauvignon). Mannitol taint, described as mannite by Pasteur, in wines is often accompanied by other wine faults, including the presence of excessive levels of acetic acid, <b>diacetyl,</b> lactic acid, and 2-butanol, which can contribute to a [...] "vinegary-estery" [...] aroma. The wine may also have a slimy sheen on the surface.|$|E
2500|$|So far, four {{species from}} the Pediococcus genus have been {{isolated}} in wines and grape must, P. inopinatus, P. pentosaceus, P. parvulus, and P. damnosus, {{with the last}} two being the species most commonly found in wine. All Pediococcus species are Gram-positive with some species being micro-aerophilic while others utilizing mostly aerobic respiration. Under the microscope, Pediococcus often appear in pairs of pairs or tetrads which can make them identifiable. [...] Pediococci are homofermenters, metabolizing glucose into a racemic mixture of both L- and D-lactate by glycolysis. However, {{in the absence of}} glucose, some species, such as P. pentosaceus, [...] begin using glycerol, degrading it into pyruvate which later can be converted to <b>diacetyl,</b> acetate, 2,3-butanediol and other compounds that can impart unfavorable characteristics to the wine.|$|E
2500|$|A wine {{undergoing}} malolactic conversion will be cloudy {{because of}} the presence of bacteria, and may have the smell of buttered popcorn, the result of the production of <b>diacetyl.</b> The onset of malolactic fermentation in the bottle is usually considered a wine fault, as the wine will appear to the consumer to still be fermenting (as a result of CO2 being produced). However, for early Vinho Verde production, this slight effervesce was considered a distinguishing trait, though Portuguese wine producers had to market the wine in opaque bottles {{because of the}} increase in turbidity and sediment that the [...] "in-bottle MLF" [...] produced. Today, most Vinho Verde producers no longer follow this practice and instead complete malolactic fermentation prior to bottle with the slight sparkle being added by artificial carbonation.|$|E
2500|$|In wine tasting, {{there is}} a big {{distinction}} made between what is considered a flaw and a fault. Wine flaws are minor attributes that depart from what are perceived as normal wine characteristics. These include excessive sulfur dioxide, volatile acidity, Brettanomyces or [...] "Brett aromas" [...] and <b>diacetyl</b> or buttery aromas. The amount to which these aromas or attributes become excessive is dependent on the particular tastes and recognition threshold of the wine taster. Generally, a wine exhibiting these qualities is still considered drinkable by most people. However, some flaws such as volatile acidity and Brettanomyces can be considered a fault when they are in such an excess that they overwhelm other components of the wine. Wine faults are generally major attributes that make a wine undrinkable to most wine tasters. Examples of wine faults include acetaldehyde (except when purposely induced in wines like Sherry and Rancio), ethyl acetate and cork taint.|$|E
2500|$|Chardonnay {{lends itself}} to most any style of wine making from dry still wines, to {{sparkling}} wines to sweet late harvest and even botrytized wines (though its susceptibility to other less favorable rot makes these wines rarer). The two winemaking decisions that most widely affect {{the end result of}} a Chardonnay wine is whether or not to use malolactic fermentation and the degree of oak influence used for the wine. With malolactic fermentation (or MLF), the harder malic acid gets converted into the softer lactic acid, and <b>diacetyl</b> which creates the [...] "buttery-ness" [...] that is associated with some styles of Chardonnay. The wines that do not go though MLF will have more green (unripe) apple like flavors. Oak can be introduced during fermentation or after {{in the form of the}} barrel aging. Depending on the amount of charring that the oak was treated with, this can introduce a [...] "toastiness" [...] and flavors that many wine drinkers mistake as a characteristic of the grape itself. These flavors can include caramel, cream, smoke, spice, coconut, cinnamon, cloves and vanilla.|$|E
2500|$|A {{wine that}} has not been sterilized by {{filtration}} might well still contain live yeast cells and bacteria. If both alcoholic and malolactic fermentation have run to completion, and neither excessive oxygen nor Brettanomyces yeast are present, this ought to cause no problems; modern hygiene has largely eliminated spoilage by bacteria such as acetobacter, which turns wine into vinegar. If there is residual sugar, however, it may undergo secondary fermentation, creating dissolved carbon dioxide as a by-product. When the wine is opened, it will be spritzy or [...] "sparkling". In a wine intended to be still this is regarded as a serious fault; it can even cause the bottle to explode. Similarly, a wine {{that has not}} been put through complete malolactic fermentation may undergo it in bottle, reducing its acidity, generating carbon dioxide, and adding a <b>diacetyl</b> butterscotch aroma. Brettanomyces yeasts add 4-ethylphenol, 4-ethylguaiacol and isovaleric acid horse-sweat aromas. These phenomena may be prevented by sterile filtration, by the addition of relatively large quantities of sulfur dioxide and sometimes sorbic acid, by mixing in alcoholic spirit to give a fortified wine of sufficient strength to kill all yeast and bacteria, or by pasteurization.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diacetyl</b> is {{produced}} during fermentation as {{a byproduct of}} valine synthesis, when yeast produces α-acetolactate, which escapes the cell and is spontaneously decarboxylated into <b>diacetyl.</b> The yeast then absorbs the <b>diacetyl,</b> and reduces the ketone groups to form acetoin and 2,3-butanediol.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diacetyl</b> desmolase {{is added}} to beer late in the brewing process to remove <b>diacetyl</b> flavor that may have {{accumulated}} during processing.|$|E
50|$|With wines {{that have}} {{excessive}} levels of <b>diacetyl,</b> some winemakers use sulfur dioxide to bind with the compound {{and reduce the}} perception of <b>diacetyl</b> by 30 to 60%.

50|$|A 2014 {{publication}} {{found that}} <b>diacetyl</b> {{was present in}} samples of many sweet-flavored electronic cigarette liquids, though at levels 100 times {{lower than that of}} tobacco smoke. According to that research, <b>diacetyl</b> is approved for food use, but is associated with respiratory disease when inhaled. The study concluded that <b>diacetyl</b> is an avoidable risk for electronic cigarette liquid, and measures could be taken by the industry to eliminate its usage, without limiting availability of flavors. In 2015, another test of 51 purpose-selected liquids found <b>diacetyl</b> at trace levels or higher in 39 of the liquids.|$|E
50|$|The European Commission has {{declared}} <b>diacetyl</b> is legal {{for use as}} a flavouring substance in all EU states.

As part of this study, the panel reviewed available studies on several other flavourings in FGE.11, including <b>diacetyl.</b> Based on the available data, the panel reiterated the finding that there were no safety concerns for diacetyl's use as a flavouring.|$|E
50|$|On 4 September 2007, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers {{recommended}} {{reduction of}} <b>diacetyl</b> in butter-like flavorings. The next day ConAgra Foods {{announced that it}} would soon remove <b>diacetyl</b> from its popcorn products.|$|E
