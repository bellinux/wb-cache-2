50|$|Artemisia campestris is {{a common}} and {{widespread}} species of plants in the sunflower family. It is native to a wide region of Eurasia and North America. Common names include <b>field</b> <b>wormwood,</b> beach wormwood, northern wormwood, Breckland wormwood boreal wormwood, Canadian wormwood, field sagewort and field mugwort.|$|E
5000|$|The {{caterpillars}} reach {{a length}} up to 55 millimeters. They are polyphagous, feeding mainly on <b>Field</b> <b>Wormwood</b> ( [...] Artemisia campestris), Sambucus sp., Rose ( [...] Rosa sp.), Blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), Broom (Cytisus scoparius), Taraxacum sp., Birch (Betula sp.), Arbutus sp., Pimpinella sp., Clover (Melilotus sp.), Cypress Spurge ( [...] Euphorbia sp.), Acacia ( [...] Mimosa longifolia), Mimosa dealbata, Salvia sp. and Salix glabra. In India, the pest {{has been reported}} to infest on Prosopis (Prosopis juliflora), Delonix regia and Sal (Shorea robusta). A nucleopolyhedrovirus suppressing populations of Ascotis seleneria has been reported in India. In many areas they are considered a pest causing serious damages to agriculture. They pupate and overwinter in the soil.|$|E
5000|$|The dunes {{began to}} form in the Bronze Age, {{developing}} considerably from the 16th to the 18th century. Their formation has been reduced by planting marram grass, heather and pine trees but this has given them as darker look. As a result, they are called [...] "grey dunes" [...] while those closer to the coast, which still attract drifting sand, are known as [...] "white dunes". The area has been protected since 1940. Among the flora {{in the area are}} blue hair grass, polypody, <b>field</b> <b>wormwood,</b> thyme, lady's bedstraw and burnet rose. Bird species include the crane, which has only recently started to breed in the area, bittern, little grebe, red-necked grebe, teal, snipe and curlew.|$|E
5000|$|Shrub {{ecosystems}} take up {{the steep}} parts of the park in places with thin topsoil layers over limy rockbase. The predominant shrubs are lilac, crown vetch, jasmine, and Christ's thorn. Grasses in these parts are mostly drought-resistant. Some rare species are fernleaf <b>wormwood,</b> <b>field</b> chamomile, and the protected species joint pine. Under protection are 20 other rare and endangered species (snowdrop, Caucasian primula, orchids, etc.) ...|$|R
60|$|Sometimes the Diggers {{aspire to}} nobler game, and succeed in entrapping the antelope, the fleetest animal of the prairies. The {{process by which}} this is {{effected}} is somewhat singular. When the snow has disappeared, says Captain Bonneville, and the ground become soft, the women go into the thickest <b>fields</b> of <b>wormwood,</b> and pulling it up in great quantities, construct with it a hedge, about three feet high, inclosing about a hundred acres. A single opening is left for the admission of the game. This done, the women conceal themselves behind the wormwood, and wait patiently for {{the coming of the}} antelopes; which sometimes enter this spacious trap in considerable numbers. As soon as they are in, the women give the signal, and the men hasten to play their part. But one of them enters the pen at a time; and, after chasing the terrified animals round the inclosure, is relieved by one of his companions. In this way the hunters take their turns, relieving each other, and keeping up a continued pursuit by relays, without fatigue to themselves. The poor antelopes, in the end, are so wearied down, that the whole party of men enter and dispatch them with clubs; not one escaping that has entered the inclosure. The most curious circumstance in this chase is, that an animal so fleet and agile as the antelope, and straining for its life, should range round and round this fated inclosure, without attempting to overleap the low barrier which surrounds it. Such, however, {{is said to be the}} fact; and such their only mode of hunting the antelope.|$|R
40|$|Drought is {{a common}} {{occurrence}} for South Dakota beef producers. The variation in weed control that ranchers need to manage for is the intensity and duration of the rainfall shortages. The common problem however, {{is what happens when}} grass and forbs become stressed and the changes to the vegetation that occurs. Stresses or disturbances that cause the grasses to slow growth and open up bare areas can include several situations; over grazing, flooding, wild fires, severe hail, growing season freeze, soil disturbances (prairie dogs or pocket gophers), and drought. Weeds are very opportunistic and competitive and will readily invade bare areas of ground that are created by these conditions. Once established weeds will aggressively compete for light, nutrients, moisture and space. This will allow for quick weed establishment and when more favorable conditions occur, weeds will spread to new areas and weed densities will increase. Weeds can be divided into three growth categories; 1. Annuals, 2. Biennials, and 3. Perennials. Within these groups they can further be categorized as cool season or warm season plants or as a broadleaf, grass or sedge plants. The plants we tend to be more concerned with during or following drought are the broadleaf weeds. The broadleaf weeds that cause the biggest problems are those introduced or invasive plants that have gotten a foothold here. In South Dakota the invasive weeds of major emphasis for grasslands include Canada thistle, leafy spurge, hoary cress, the knapweeds, biennial thistles (musk, plumeless, bull and scotch), the toadflaxes, <b>field</b> bindweed, absinth <b>wormwood</b> and common mullein. All of these and others are on South Dakotaâ€™s state wide and locally noxious lists. They are considered regulated pests in the state. Another group of plants that can take advantage of drought and become a problem in range settings is some native forbs like the vervains, common sunflower, horseweed or marestail, golden rod family, perennial ragweed and cudweed sagewort. In normal conditions these plants are not considered invasive. They can have good forage value at certain growth stages. This can reduce grazing pressure on desirable grass species recovering form drought...|$|R
5000|$|... "Topographically," [...] says Nikolai Przhevalsky, [...] "it is a {{perfectly}} level plain, which in all probability once formed the bed of a huge lake or inland sea." [...] He concludes this based on the level area of {{the region as a}} whole, the hard saldgine clay and the sand-strewn surface and, lastly, the salt lakes which occupy its lowest parts. For hundreds of kilometers, nothing can be seen but bare sands; in some places they continue so far without a break that the Mongols call them Tengger (i.e. sky). These vast expanses are absolutely waterless, nor do any oases relieve the unbroken stretches of yellow sand, which alternate with equally vast areas of saline clay or, nearer the foot of the mountains, with barren shingle. Although on the whole a level country with a general altitude of 1000 to 1500 m, this section, like most other parts of the Gobi, is crowned by a chequered network of hills and broken ranges going up 300 m higher. The vegetation is confined to a few varieties of bushes and a dozen kinds of grasses and herbs, the most conspicuous being saxaul (Haloxylon ammondendron) and Agriophyllum gobicum. The others include prickly convolvulus, <b>field</b> <b>wormwood</b> (Artemisia campestris), acacia, Inula ammophila, Sophora flavescens, Convolvulus ammanii, Peganum and Astragalus, but all dwarfed, deformed and starved. The fauna consists of little but antelope, wolf, fox, hare, hedgehog, marten, numerous lizards and a few birds, e.g. the sandgrouse, lark, stonechat, sparrow, crane, Henderson's ground jay (Podoces hendersoni), horned lark (Eremophila alpestris), and crested lark (Galerida cristata).|$|E
40|$|Artemisia campestris is a {{perennial}} herb, {{commonly known as}} <b>field</b> <b>wormwood.</b> it is widespread in Asia, North America, Europe and north Africa. the different parts of this plant are used as anthelmintic, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, emmenagogue, antivenom, and to treat digestive and cutaneous problems. an exhaustive bibliographic research of this plant {{has been carried out}} by means of scientific engines and databases like Google scholar, PubMed, Sciencedirect and sciFinder; as a result, it has been found that this herb possesses a rich phytochemical content and a wide range of pharmacological activities such as antioxidant, antibacterial, antimutagenic, antivenom and antitumor effects. In an aim to highlight the importance of A. campestris L., this review has been established by discussing its ethnomedicinal, morphological, ecological, phytochemical, pharmacological and toxicological studies.
