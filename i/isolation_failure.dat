40|$|Abstract — Rural electrification, {{regardless}} of whichever electrification scheme is utilized (grid extension, mini grids, or autonomous energy home systems) has many potential benefits. In particular, hybrid mini grid power systems are potentially highly valuable electrification scheme for remote rural electrification {{in comparison with}} other electrification schemes but they involve significant complexities in terms of design, implementation, and operation and maintenance. This implies {{that there are many}} challenges that have to be overcome before the benefits of hybrid systems can be achieved. A detail literature review and targeted consultations with a range of Fijian stakeholders were undertaken to better understand options for addressing some of the technical as well as the non-technical issues leading to the failure of hybrid mini grids in Fiji. Key findings suggest that lack of proper documentation on systems, carrying out system designs in <b>isolation,</b> <b>failure</b> to incorporate learnt from previous projects into newer projects and failure to understand the system and limitations; all are the contributing factors for an unsuccessful and unsustainable hybrid mini-grid in Fiji. Finally, this paper suggests some useful guidelines for successful and sustainable hybrid mini grid systems. Index Terms — mini grid, rural electrification, sustainable, I...|$|E
40|$|Westinghouse is {{currently}} conducting the pre-application licensing of the International Reactor Innovative and Secure (IRIS). One {{of the key}} aspects of the IRIS design is its safety-by-designTM philosophy and within this framework the PRA is being used {{as an integral part}} of the design process. The most ambitious risk-related goal for IRIS is to reduce the Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) to within the exclusion area by demonstrating that the off-site doses are consistent with the US Protective Action Guidelines (PAGs) for initiation of emergency response so that the required protective actions would be limited to the exclusion area. As a first step, a model has been developed to provide a first order approximation of the Large Early Release Frequency (LERF) as a surrogate predictor of the off-site doses. A key-aspect of the LERF model development is the characterization of the possible paths of release. Four main categories have been historically pointed out: (1) Core Damage (CD) sequences with containment bypass, (2) CD sequences with containment <b>isolation</b> <b>failure,</b> (3) CD sequences with containment failure at low pressure and (4) CD sequences with containment failure at high pressure.

40|$|Background. Many {{technical}} variations {{are possible}} in the placing and management of a double-lumen tube (DLT). We surveyed our practice to relate these variations to {{the course of the}} anaesthetic. Methods. Weused a questionnaire toobtain details of technique in 506 consecutive double lumen intubations. The details were related to the incidence of secretions, tube displacement, and decreases of oxygen saturation (< 88 %) during one lung anaesthesia (OLA). Results. Robertshaw tubes were used for 482 of the 506 intubations. During OLA there were 48 instances of desaturation (< 88 %), 19 cases of upper lobe obstruction, 15 of carinal obstruction, 16 of <b>isolation</b> <b>failure,</b> eight of excessive secretions (none of whom had received an antisialogogue; P< 0. 01) and 12 miscellaneous events. The experience of the anaesthetist or use of a fibre-optic bronchoscope did not affect these events. Air was of no advantage as a maintenance gas. Atropine 400 – 600 mg appeared to prevent desaturation onOLA (P< 0. 05) but glycopyrrolate 200 mg did not. Conclusion.

But till now, there is no index to indicate the whole foundry process’s early detection capability. In this paper, we firstly introduced the early detection calculation methods and define Early Detection Score (EDS) which covers the whole manufacturing process from AA (Active Area definition) to FT (Final Test) with three key screening stages: inline, WAT, and FT. With these three keys, we can assign the score accordingly based on the detection stage and timing. The earlier it is detected, the higher the score. Furthermore, we proposed five calculations, which can be applied for different purpose or improvements. In addition to the numerical calculation methods, we develop a total solution for the early detection system, which includes data collection, calculation template, scoring scheme, early detection capability target for each stage, and the routine (e. g., weekly/ monthly) review system...|$|E
40|$|Based {{on level}} 2 {{analyses}} in IPE (Individual Plant Examination) submittals accident progression, perspectives {{were obtained for}} all containment types. These perspectives consisted of insights on containment failure modes, releases therein, and factors responsible for the results. To illustrate the types of perspectives acquired on severe accident progresssion, insights obtained for (BWR) Mark I containments are discussed here. Mark I containments have high strength but small volumes and rely on pressure suppression pools to condense steam released from the reactor coolant system during an accident. Accidents causing structural failure of the drywell shortly after the core debris melts through the reactor vessel {{were found to be}} dominant contributors to risk. Importance of individual containment failure mechanisms depends on plant features and in some cases on modeling assumptions; however the following mechanisms were found important: drywell shell melt-through caused by direct contact with core debris and drywell failure caused by rapid pressure/temperature pulses at time of vessel melt-through. Drywell failure caused by gradual pressure/temperature buildup due to gases and steam released during core/concrete interactions is important in some IPEs. In other IPEs vent was an important contributor. However, accidents that bypass containment (eg interfacing systems LOCA) or involve containment <b>isolation</b> <b>failure</b> were not important contributors to the CDF in any of the IPEs for Mark I plants. These accidents are also not important to risk (even though they can involve large fission product release) because their frequencies of occurrence are so much lower than frequencies of early structural failure caused by other accidents that dominate the CDF...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{hypothesis}} is that cancer is driven by a small subpopulation of cells called “cancer stem cells” (CSCs) with an unlimited proliferative potential. These cells {{are thought to be}} responsible {{for the development of the}} tumor representing the only cell population able to sustain tumor growth and progression. In the present study we investigated whether CSCs could be isolated in patients with metastatic lung cancer (LC), breast cancer (BC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) and whether in vitro CSCs sensitivity assay could identify an effective treatment. The study was conducted in NSCLC patients with metastatic disease progressing after standard therapies. CSCs were isolated from effusions or fresh cancer tissue from primary tumor or metastasis. CSCs were cultivated in vitro and tested against different chemotherapy or targeted agents. The drug or the drugs combination leading to the highest CSC mortality rate was further administered to the patient. A total of 23 patients were included onto the study. Main characteristics were: median age 66 years (range 42 - 85), male sex in 14 cases (60 %), with LC in 18 cases (78 %), CRC in 3 cases (13 %), other gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma in 2 cases (9 %). CSCs were obtained from liver metastases in 6 cases (25 %), pleural lung nodule excision in 2 cases (8 %), lymphnode excision in 3 cases (12, 5 %) and by pleural or peritoneal effusion in 13 cases (54 %). CSCs were successfully isolated in 15 patients (65 %). Main reasons for CSCs <b>isolation</b> <b>failure</b> included inadequate material (6 cases), contamination (1 case) or delivery problems.

40|$|AbstractWells {{have been}} {{identified}} as posing a greater risk for leakage from CO 2 storage sites than geological features such as faults and fractures, particularly in mature sedimentary basins with high well density such as those onshore in North America. A commonly-held belief is that CO 2 injection wells will pose a lesser risk than wells drilled for other purposes because greater care would be taken in regard to their completion and operation. The existence of CO 2 and acid gas injection operations in Alberta, Canada, provided the opportunity to test this hypothesis. Currently in Alberta there are 31 wells used for CO 2 injection and 48 wells used for the disposal of produced acid gas (a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 S that is separated from sour gas to meet pipeline and market specifications). Only 22 wells were drilled specifically with the purpose of injecting CO 2 or acid gas; all others are previous wells that have been subsequently converted to injection wells. Well failures include: surface casing vent flow, casing failure, tubing failure, packer failure, and zonal <b>isolation</b> <b>failure.</b> The incidence of well failure is greater in the case of converted wells than in the case of wells drilled and completed for injection purposes. Most failures are not caused by injection; they are due to general causes encountered in the general well population. Failures due to injection are mostly tubing and packer failures, which are monitored by regulation and are easily detected and repaired. The incidence of well failure is greater for wells drilled prior to the advent of regulations in 1994 regarding drilling and completion of injection wells. While the incidence of failure in the CO 2 and acid gas injection wells in Alberta is comparable to that in the general well population, the analysis indicates that injection wells drilled for purpose and under a proper regulatory regime have a lesser incidence of failure than the general well population. A proper regulatory framework for CO 2 injection wells is essential for reducing and preventing well failures...|$|E
30|$|Virtualization {{technology}} {{was developed by}} IBM in 1960 to maximize the utilization of hardware resources because powerful and expensive mainframe computers were underutilized. It is a thin software layer running between Operating System (OS) and system hardware, termed as a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) or hypervisor, that control, manage, and mapped multifarious VM’s (applications running on guest OS) on a single platform [14 – 16]. Also, it is a complete software and hardware stack to fulfill the incoming request or provide a service to users [17]. Examples of popular virtualization software are VMware ESX and ESXi [18], Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) [19, 20]/Quick Emulator (QEMU), Citrix XenServer [21], Microsoft Virtual PC [22], Microsoft Hyper-V [23], Oracle VM VirtualBox [24], and Parallels Desktop for Mac [25]. The main advantage of virtualization is to provide better resource utilization by running multiple VM’s parallels on a single server. Hypervisor supports the legacy OS to combine numerous under-utilized servers load onto a single server and also support fault tolerance and performance isolation to achieve better cloud data centers performance. Due to VM’s <b>isolation,</b> <b>failure</b> of one VM {{does not have an}} effect on execution/functioning of other VM’s and on the entire physical machine [26]. To improve CDC efficiency, different types of resource management strategies like server consolidation, load balancing, server up-gradation, power management etc. are applied through migration of single/multiple VM’s. Also to achieve energy efficient environment, it combines numerous servers’ loads onto a few physical servers and switch off the idle servers. For improving application performance, hypervisor also helps to migrate the running VM’s from a low-performing to another better performing physical server [27]. Consequentially, co-hosting several different types of VM’s onto a few servers is a challenging issue for researchers because resource contention among co-hosted applications that leads to servers over-utilization which results in application performance degradation [15, 28 – 31]. Also a large number of cloud applications like interactive applications experience frequently changeable workload requests that generate dynamic resource demand which results in Service Level Agreement (SLA’s) violation and performance degradation if dynamic server consolidation is used.|$|E
40|$|Although semen is a {{particularly}} rich source of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and is useful for monitoring CMV shedding, its culturing is associated with extensive monolayer toxicity, <b>isolation</b> <b>failures,</b> and lengthy detection times. Inoculation of fractionated semen with immunoperoxidase staining of monolayers eliminated virtually all toxicity, increased isolation rates and monolayer infectivity, and greatly reduced detection times. Semen specimens (n = 73) were processed conventionally (C) or separated into supernatant (SF) and cellular pellet (PF) fractions, and 35 % of C and SF inocula produced extensive toxicity. In contrast, virtually no toxicity was observed in monolayers inoculated with PF. C and SF isolation rates were 41 of 73 and 38 of 73, respectively, whereas that for PF was 51 of 73. Although monolayer infectivity at initial CMV detection was often less than 10 % for C and SF, it was as much as 25 % for PF.

40|$|Healthcare-associated infections, in {{particular}} those caused by antibiotic-resistant organisms, {{are a major}} cause of morbidity, mortality and increased cost to healthcare providers and MRSA are, in terms of prevalence, by far the most significant resistant organisms in the United Kingdom as well as many other countries worldwide. Isolation of hospital patients, usually in single rooms, is intended to interrupt the transmission of potential pathogens between patients and/or staff. Risk assessment is used to determine whether individual patients with potentially transmissible pathogens, including MRSA, should be isolated in single rooms. However, limited isolation room availability and/or operational needs may compromise this process and this has contributed to a general perception that although isolation may be recommended, in many cases it is not achieved {{due to a lack of}} facilities and conflicting priorities for the use of those facilities. Despite it being considered as standard practice the evidence for the efficacy of isolation in a single room in preventing the transmission of MRSA is limited. An initial study examined, prospectively, the incidence of <b>isolation</b> <b>failure</b> in a large UK National Health Service hospital and the relationship between the rate of 'failure to isolate' of patients from whose clinical samples MRSA had been identified and the rate of MRSA identified from samples sent for clinical purposes, per ward. A subsequent study compared the transmission of MRSA from index cases who were isolated and those who were not isolated with a cohort of contacts who were immediately adjacent to them. The results of these studies demonstrate that 'failure to isolate' is a frequent occurrence; isolation requirements were not met in 22 % of cases and that there was a significant correlation between failing to isolate patients with MRSA, and rates of MRSA identified from samples sent for clinical purposes (Spearman's p= 0. 596, p< 0. 001). Conversely there was no significant difference in the MRSA acquisition rates in the contacts of people with MRSA who were not isolated vs. index cases who were isolated. Risk factors for MRSA acquisition in multivariate analysis were: exposure to antibiotics(quinolones and macrolides),presence of a nasogastric tube, dermatological conditions and the index case being risk-assessed as requiring isolation. Further research is needed into the efficacy of isolation in preventing the hospital transmission of MRSA. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

An analysis of the implicit assumptions in paleomagnetic studies of fold and thrust belts reveals three possible sources of error with an intrinsic structural (geometric) control; 1) overlapped paleomagnetic directions (laboratory <b>isolation</b> <b>failures),</b> 2) rock volume deformation pas-sively recorded by the paleomagnetic vector (non rigid-body behaviour), and 3) incorrect restoration of beds in non-coaxial structures (bedding correction failures in conical, plunging folds, etc). The dif-ferent errors can be detected by applying simple geometric techniques like the stereographic scattering, the inclination vs. dip and the declination vs. strike diagrams, the fold test, the small circle reconstruc-tion during unfolding and the geometry of the dispersion of the net tectonic rotation axes. Finally, a list of reliability criteria is proposed to evaluate the quality of investigation focused on the characteri-zation of vertical axis rotations in fold and thrust belts...|$|R
30|$|We are {{interested}} in the robustness of SensApp, which is commonly understood as its ability to cope with failures, and which can intuitively be improved using two main strategies: replication and isolation. In case of failures, replication leverages backup components whereas <b>isolation</b> minimises <b>failure</b> propagation. In practise, good isolation enables efficient replication, as it permits to only replicate the most critical parts. Breaking down SensApp into six separate services improves isolation by restricting how failures can propagate (which is not the case in a monolithic implementation) and makes possible to replicate the database if needed.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPortland cement {{can play}} a major role in {{providing}} cost-effective, long-term zonal isolation for CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) used to mitigate climate change. However, achieving zonal isolation with Portland cement under supercritical CO 2 environment for the required 1, 000 year trapping period may be challenging. Some laboratory researchers report that Portland cement disintegrates when exposed to CO 2, leading to potential leakage into the atmosphere or other to underground zones. Other researchers cite Portland cement samples from 30 – 50 year old CO 2 EOR wells where sealing integrity was maintained, even though carbonation was found. In this paper we will discuss reasons likely for this disparity between research lab test results and actual well performance data. Carbonation of Portland cement is a thermodynamically favorable process and therefore difficult to avoid. But the effects can be minimized by various reactive chemical components optimized for the specific thermodynamic conditions. Our research shows partial carbonation of Portland cement is not detrimental unless the mechanical integrity is insufficient to provide effective zonal isolation. For these studies we have developed CO 2 treatment test cells capable of producing conditions up to 200  °F and 2, 000 psi. In addition, various analytical instruments including x-ray diffraction (XRD), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and mechanical properties measurement devices have been used for this study. In this paper we will discuss the importance of understanding the percentage of carbonation and depth of CO 2 penetration, and how to control these factors by optimizing the cement blend. Interestingly, we found the amount of Portlandite { Ca(OH) 2 } that forms due to cement hydration and the cement-to-water ratio dictates the depth of penetration as well as percentage carbonation. The implications of this in relation to the long term chemical integrity of the cement sheath under downhole CCS conditions is discussed. This paper also includes the results of recent studies on the changes in mechanical properties of a properly optimized Portland cement blend for a period of up to one year. During this period, measurements were made at different time intervals to examine cement specimen treated with CO 2 at 200  °F and 2, 000 psi in the presence of water. The results show carbonation without any sign of loss of mechanical or sealing integrity that could lead to zonal <b>isolation</b> <b>failure.</b> Results from a separate set of experiments show the following: (1) Carbonation could be minimized by reducing the Portland cement content by adding Pozzolanic materials and by reducing the permeability and (2) Carbonation could help heal micro-cracks that may be caused by various well operations or ageing. However, such carbonation-induced healing is limited only to a certain width of cracks. In summary of this research, it is recommend that: (1) a high quality primary cement job be performed in adherence to all industry best practices; (2) the cement blend be properly optimized to minimize long-term CO 2 corrosion; and (3) the sheath be designed for long-term mechanical integrity. This paper will discuss a comprehensive approach that may be taken to help ensure longer-term effective zonal isolation in new CO 2 wells and remedial solutions for old wells and for plugging and abandoning wells...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and purpose: Aging {{population}} is increasing {{and it is}} of great importance to predict factors that promote {{physical and mental health}} status of elderly. This study aimed to predict the perceived rejection based on early maladaptive Schema among active and inactive elderly. Methods & Materials: We used cluster sampling method to collect 150 elderly (included 75 active and 75 inactive elderly) retried from oil and gas company. Respondents were asked to fill the perceived rejection scale and the short form of Early Maladaptive Schema (YSQ-SF) questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis. Findings: results of this study showed that there are significant relationships between perceived rejection and schemas of emotional deprivation, mistrust/abuse, social <b>isolation,</b> shame/defectiveness, <b>failure,</b> subjugation & insufficient self-control/self-discipline in active elderly. Besides, there were significant associations between perceived rejection and schemas of emotional deprivation, abandonment / instability, mistrust/abuse, social <b>isolation,</b> shame/defectiveness, <b>failure</b> & entitlement among inactive elders. Findings from regression analysis indicated that schemas of emotional deprivation, emotional inhibition & failure could predict perceived rejection among active elders. However, schemas of emotional inhibition and vulnerability to harm or illness can predict perceived rejection among inactive elders. Conclusion: In general, our findings revealed that perceived rejection among active elderly was predicted by interpersonal aspects of emotional scheme. Conversely, perceived rejection among inactive elderly is more predicted by Intrapersonal aspects...|$|R

40|$|Maintaining {{availability}} in {{the face}} of failures is a critical requirement for Internet services. Existing approaches in cluster-based data storage rely on redundancy to survive a small number of failures, but the system becomes entirely unavailable if more failures occur. We describe an approach that allows a cluster file server to isolate failures so that the system can continue to serve most clients. Our approach is complementary to existing redundancy-based methods: redundancy can mask the first few <b>failures,</b> and <b>failure</b> <b>isolation</b> can take over and maintain availability for the majority of clients if more failures occur. The building blocks of our design are selfcontained and load-balanced file servers called islands. The main idea underlying island-based design is the one-island principle: as many operations as possible should involve exactly one island. The one-island principle provides <b>failure</b> <b>isolation</b> because each island can function independently of other islands' failures. [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{present the}} first Internet {{architecture}} {{designed to provide}} route control, <b>failure</b> <b>isolation,</b> and explicit trust information for end-to-end communications. SCION separates ASes into groups of independent routing sub-planes, called trust domains, which then interconnect to form complete routes. Trust domains provide natural <b>isolation</b> of routing <b>failures</b> and human misconfiguration, give endpoints strong control for both inbound and outbound traffic, provide meaningful and enforceable trust, and enable scalable routing updates with high path freshness. As a result, our architecture provides strong resilience and security properties as an intrinsic consequence of good design principles, avoiding piecemeal add-on protocols as security patches. Meanwhile, SCION only assumes that a few top-tier ISPs in the trust domain are trusted for providing reliable end-to-end communications, thus achieving a small Trusted Computing Base. Both our security analysis and evaluation results show that SCION naturally prevents numerous attacks and provides {{a high level of}} resilience, scalability, control, and isolation. I...|$|R
