40|$|Eight drying {{trials were}} {{conducted}} in each solar tunnel dryer (STD) and compared with open sun drying (OSD). The drying behavior of mackerel drying in STD was studied by comparing eleven different drying models. The Midilli model provided the highest R 2 (0. 9928), lowest 2 χ (0. 000406) and RMSE (0. 0164). The drying time required for STD and OSD were 27 and 48 h, respectively. The overall drying efficiency of the STD and OSD was about 19. 87 and 12 %, respectively. STD significantly influenced the biochemical properties such as Free fatty acid (FFA), Peroxide value (PV), Thiobarbituric acid (TBA), total volatile bases nitrogen (TVB-N), Trimethylamine nitrogen (TMA-N) and histamine of <b>dried</b> <b>mackerel.</b> There was a significant positive relationship between drying temperature and time (R 2 > 0. 85). No microbial growth on dried product was found in STD dried fish. Sensory quality of <b>dried</b> <b>mackerel</b> was judged by ten experienced sensory panel experts using a seven point hedonic scale. The fish dried at temperatures ranging from 40 - 46 oC for 20 - 30 h were awarded the highest scores by the sensory panel. Contour plots of <b>dried</b> <b>mackerel</b> showed that for all sensory attributes examined, panelists preferred fish dried with STD. Time series sensory evaluation of the shelf-life revealed that <b>dried</b> <b>mackerel</b> stored at ambient temperature is acceptable to the sensory panel until 154 and < 98 days, for STD and OSD, respectively. The financial analysis showed that the average net income year- 1 (for 10 years) is about 45, 223 Indian Rupees (INR) and the pay-back period is < 1. 5 years.

40|$|Muara Kintap {{village in}} Kintap District  Kabupaten Tanah Laut {{is a central}} area of salted dried  {{mackerel}} processing  and becoming famous  in South Kalimantan. The salted <b>dried</b> <b>mackerel</b> fish produced in Muara Kintap village is better quality compared with the mackerel fish produced in another villages distributed  in South Kalimantan. The mackerel fish is directly handled by salted and  dried on vessel after caught on sea.   This purposes from research are to know benefit, feasibility, sensitivity fluctuation price, variation price, and marketing chanell from business analysis of salted <b>dried</b> <b>mackerel</b> while research method used is census. Salted dried mackerel fish processing is becoming  an advantagous business in the Muara Kintap village becaused total revenue is greater than total cost, and   well above the BEP during and {{in out of the}} fishing seasons.   Based on the analysis of the feasibility of the NPV at 13 % = 82. 088. 266   Net BCR 13 % = 1, 148, and IRR = 15, 3 %, the salted <b>dried</b> <b>mackerel</b> fish processing business is worth to the effort.             Likewise when not in season the NPV 13 % = 132. 237. 410, Net BCR 13 % = 1, 277, and IRR = 16, 7 %. It can be said that the salted dried  mackerel fish business is more feasible in out of the season. The results of sensitivity analysis with an increase of 25 % diesel and 50 % salt  for  processing  is sensitive to the time of the season while at no season is not sensitive to the increase in input prices.

40|$|The {{loss of a}} large {{quantity}} of dried fish in Bangladesh is due to infestation by earwigs, hide beetles and copra beetles in storage godowns. The most destructive pest is the hide beetle. Dennestes maculatus Degeer. Earwigs of different stages of development were exposed to 10, 20 and 30 krad of gamma radiation for disinfestation. No live insects were seen 3 weeks after the treatment. Studies on <b>dried</b> <b>mackerel</b> infested with hide beetles showed that eggs, larvae and pupae could be checked at a dose of 20 krad.

The fresh fish samplesobtained from local markets in Ibadan, Nigeria were dried in a {{convective}} fish dryer at 60 °C, 90 °/ 60 °C(90 °C at initial stage and later at 60 °C) and 90 °C drying temperatures. The average microbial load (Total viable bacteria,total coliform and total fungal counts) obtained from <b>dried</b> <b>Mackerel,</b> Pilchard and Herring for 8 hrsduration ranged from 0. 15 x 104 to 2. 4 x 10 4 Colonies per gram sample (cfug - 1).

40|$|Abstract: This study {{attempts}} {{to determine the}} effect of feeding mackerel dried by low temperature vacuum method to mice on their learning behavior and fatty acid composition of the nervous system. Thirty-two male mice were fed either a control (palm oil, control group) diet or a diet of 20 % <b>dried</b> <b>mackerel</b> (mackerel group) for three months. Learning behav-ior was assessed using a passive avoidance test, and the tissue fatty acid composition was measured after the behavioral test. The lack of experience with electronic foot shocks resulted in both the control and mackerel groups showing shorter latency during the acquisition trial (Day 1). The avoidance latencies of each group subsequently increased after multiple acquisition trials. The mackerel group showed a significantly longer avoidance latency on day 2 than {{was the case with the}} control group (p < 0. 05). In terms of the fatty acid composition of the serum and nervous tissues such as the brain and retina, the mackerel group showed increased percentages of total n- 3 fatty acids, and especially docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids. Meanwhile, the control group showed decreased DHA levels, but increased docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn- 6) levels. From the above results, it may be concluded that the intake of mackerel dried by low temperature vacuum improved learning behavior, as assessed by passive avoidance test, with increased DHA in the brain.

40|$|The <b>dried</b> horse <b>mackerels</b> were {{prepared}} by sun drying or osmotic dehydrating method {{and the changes}} of lipids and proteins were examined. The amounts of phospholipids decreased and those of free fatty acids increased during sun drying. The peroxide and carbonyl values were increased by both of sun drying and osmotic dehydrating method. These suggested the occurrence of lipid oxidation even at lower temperatures such as 5 ± 1 ℃. The acid value (AV) increased with time during sun drying, while the changes of AV were not observed by osmotic dehydrating method. The thiobarbituric acid value was increased in salt-dried samples by osmotic dehydrating method. This may indicate the inhibitory effect of lipid oxidation by salt. The volatile basic nitrogen compounds and trimethylamine, components as cause of fish odor, increased markedly in tasted with mirin and sun-dried fish and sun-dried fish without seasoning with time, compared with those in salted sun-dried fish...|$|R
40|$|Autolytic {{activity}} in the muscle of Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta) cured in saturated brine and dry salt, was monitored at pH 3, 4, 9 and 10 along with weight loss, moisture, salt and a-amino nitrogen, at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h of curing. The fish lost 14 to 29 % of the initial weight after 48 h of curing, in brine and dry salt, respectively. Correspondingly the moisture decreased from 76 to 57 % in brine cured and 52 % in dry salted fish. Salt content in the muscle increased from 1 % to 14. 82 and 13. 32 % {{in the case of}} brine cured and <b>dry</b> salted <b>mackerel</b> respectively, with slower uptake of salt in the latter because of the lesser surface area in contact. Tissue proteinases were activated initially in all cases when salting commenced, with higher activation in the case of pH 3 and 4. But subsequently increasing salt concentrations. suppressed the autolytic activity. Autolytic proteinases in the mackerel muscle were suppressed between 37 to 78 % of their original {{activity in}} case of the brine cured fish and between 36 to 74 % in the dry salted fish, at the pH assayed. Concentration of a-amino nitrogen in the muscle increased initially in both types of curing at 3 h, but decreased later on. Autolytic activity assayed in the presence of salt containing buffers showed that at 10 - 20 % salt level, (the concentrations prevailing in fish after 48 h salting), 36 - 71 % of the original tissue proteinase activity was still intact, which can affect cured product quality...|$|R
