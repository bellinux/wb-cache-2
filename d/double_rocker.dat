50|$|Significant {{challenges}} in the commercialization of engines utilizing hemispherical chambers revolved around {{the design of the}} valve actuation, and how to make it effective, efficient, and reliable at an acceptable cost. This complexity was referenced early in Chrysler's development of their 1950s hemi engine: the head was referred to in company advertising as the <b>Double</b> <b>Rocker</b> head.|$|E
50|$|A rocker sole shoe or {{rocker bottom}} shoe is a shoe {{which has a}} thicker-than-normal sole with rounded heel. Such shoes ensure the wearer does not have flat footing along the proximal-distal axis of the foot. The shoes are generically known {{by a variety of}} names {{including}} round bottom shoes, round/ed sole shoes, and toning shoes, but also by various brand names. Tyrell & Carter identified at least six standard variations of the rocker sole shoe and named them: toe-only rocker, rocker bar, mild rocker, heel-to-toe rocker, negative heel rocker and <b>double</b> <b>rocker.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had {{the same}} piston stroke as their English counterparts and were also equipped with a fork valve gear (Gabelsteuerung). The locomotive OFFENBURG had a Capry valve gear on delivery. The engines had improved running gear however due to their adjustable leaf springs and centre axle box. The last engine of this class, EXPANSION No. 15, had a Meyer <b>double</b> <b>rocker</b> (Doppelschwing) valve gear, a larger cylinder bore of 381 mm, higher boiler pressure of 5.0 bar and 101 heating tubes. Its larger heating area generated an increase in power.|$|E

5000|$|The top-of-the-line 300C version uses a 5.7 L (345 cu in) Hemi V8. Using the Multidisplacement System (MDS), this engine can run on four {{cylinders}} when {{less power}} {{is needed in}} order to reduce total fuel consumption.

It uses a five-speed automatic transmission and comes standard with 18-inch chrome-clad alloy wheels, Chrysler's MyGIG Infotainment System in 2008 and SIRIUS Satellite Radio and Backseat Television in 2008. The HEMI engine includes a pushrod induction tube, located {{on the side of the}} engine-block. This tube makes the 300C more fuel efficient and quicker, because of the air being [...] "pulled and pushed" [...] into the engine's induction area. The engine uses the HEMI, or <b>double</b> <b>rocker</b> configuration, with a cam-in-block, overhead valve (OHV) pushrod design. There are two spark plugs per cylinder to promote efficient fuel/air mixture burn and thereby reduce emissions. In 2009 - 2010 power output was increased to 360HP.|$|E

The walking energy cost per time (WECt) during 35 minutes, heart rate intensity, and total calorie consumption were compared by using pair t-test. The WECt and total calorie consumption were found to be significantly higher(p<. 05) in CDR than NR. However, there was no difference in HRi.

40|$|BACKGROUND More {{than three}} million persons are {{disabled}} by leprosy worldwide. The main complication of sensory nerve damage is neuropathic ulceration, particularly of the feet. In this review we explored interventions that can prevent and treat secondary damage to skin and limbs. OBJECTIVE To assess {{the effects of}} self-care, dressings and footwear in preventing and healing secondary damage to the skin in persons affected by leprosy. METHODS Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (April 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2008), MEDLINE (from 2003 to April 2008), EMBASE (from 2005 to April 2008), CINAHL (1982 - 2006) and LILACS (1982 - April 2008) as well as online registers of ongoing trials (April 2008). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials involving anyone with leprosy and damage to peripheral nerves treated with any measures designed to prevent damage {{with the aim of}} healing existing ulcers and preventing development of new ulcers. Data collection and analysis: Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS Eight trials with a total of 557 participants were included. The quality of the trials was generally poor. The interventions and outcome measures were diverse. Although three studies that compared zinc tape to more traditional dressings found some benefit, none of these showed a statistically significant effect. One trial indicated that topical ketanserin had a better effect on wound healing than clioquinol cream or zinc paste, RR was 6. 00 (95 % CI 1. 45 to 24. 75). We did not combine the results of the two studies that compared topical phenytoin to saline dressing, but both studies found statistically significant effects in favour of phenytoin for healing of ulcer (SMD - 2. 34; 95 % CI - 3. 30 to - 1. 39; and SMD - 0. 79; 95 % CI - 1. 20 to 0. 39). Canvas shoes were not much better than PVC-boots, and <b>double</b> <b>rocker</b> shoes did not promote healing much more than below-knee plasters. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS One study suggested that topical ketanserin is more effective than clioquinol cream or zinc paste. Topical phenytoin (two studies) may be more effective than saline dressing regarding ulcer healing. For the other dressings the results were equivocal. Canvas shoes were a little better than PVC-boots, but not significantly, and the effect of <b>double</b> <b>rocker</b> shoes compared to below-knee plasters was no different in promoting the healing of ulcers. No side effects were documented...|$|E
40|$|When {{multifunctional}} pipeline repair machinery (MPRM) {{is used in}} {{the deep}} sea area, it is difficult to grip the pipeline and ensure concentricity between the cutter heads and the pipeline during its operation. In view of this, a new system of two-arm holding self-centering pipeline clamping device was proposed. The system is composed of two groups of parallelogram double-rocker mechanism and cranking block mechanism which are symmetrically distributed on the frame. The geometric parameter solutions of the clamping device were analyzed with motion and transmission as the constraints. A mechanical model was established to associate the friction torque of clamping points with the driving force. Clamping device and machinery were designed and manufactured for the Ø 304. 8 – 457. 2  mm pipelines used in this test. ADAMS simulation experiments were conducted underwater, and the cutting and beveling tests were carried out onshore. The following results are achieved. First, the smaller the pipe diameter, the smaller the transmission angle of the oscillating slider mechanism; the longer the hydraulic cylinder stroke, the greater the transmission angle of the <b>double</b> <b>rocker</b> mechanism. Second, the driving force of the clamping device increases with the increase of the pipe diameter. When the diameter reaches 457. 2  mm, the hydraulic cylinder driving force of the clamping device should be greater than 10219  N. Third, the feed rate of the cutters increases suddenly due to the slight shaking of the machinery which occurs {{at the beginning of the}} pipe cutting, so it is necessary to adopt a small feed rate. And fourth, onshore experiment results agree well with the theoretical design and simulation results, proving the rationality of the system. The research results in this paper provide technical basis for the research and development of similar engineering prototypes...|$|E
