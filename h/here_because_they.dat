There are many more vaguely defined subgenres that are not mentioned <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are not as easily defined.|$|E
2500|$|However, Buddhadasa {{was skeptical}} of his fame; when {{reflecting}} on the busloads of visitors to Suan Mokkh he would say, [...] "sometimes I think {{many of these people}} just stop <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have to visit the bathroom." ...|$|E
2500|$|The aorist {{negative}} and impotential characteristics are given <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are anomalous. Note, that the [...] "-z" [...] of the aorist negative (-mez) and impotential (-(y)emez) is {{dropped in the}} first-person singular and plural, {{in order to be}} able to suffix it. (Aorist negative first-person singular: -mem; BUT: Aorist impotential third-person plural: -(y)emezler) ...|$|E
5000|$|Endemic species - {{those found}} nowhere else, either <b>because</b> <b>they</b> evolved <b>here</b> or <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have become extinct {{everywhere}} else - such as Hamilton's Frog, perhaps the rarest frog {{in the world}} and the Ngaio Weevil, a large flightless Weevil ...|$|R
50|$|The {{galleries}} <b>here</b> are mobile <b>because</b> <b>they</b> can {{be divided}} into different sizes and spaces.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are right. I suppose {{some men}} get bad out <b>here</b> simply <b>because</b> <b>they</b> haven't any good example to follow. They cut loose from their old {{associates}} {{and fall in}} with the wrong sort." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "The {{streets were}} {{never meant to}} be for pedestrians," [...] Robert N. Rich, then head of the company, told a {{reporter}} for the New York Times in 1999, apparently referring to Tresser Boulevard and the immediate area around it. [...] "GTE came <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were bombed in New York. Crime was a problem in the city. That's why the buildings were designed to be impenetrable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Israeli {{academic}} Yehouda Shenhav {{has written}} {{in an article}} entitled [...] "Hitching A Ride on the Magic Carpet" [...] published in the Israeli daily Haaretz regarding this issue. [...] "Shlomo Hillel, a government minister and an active Zionist in Iraq, adamantly opposed the analogy: [...] "I don't regard the departure of Jews from Arab lands as that of refugees. They came <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> wanted to, as Zionists." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{nuclease}} enzyme ERCC1-XPF cuts specific {{structures of}} DNA. Many aspects {{of these two}} gene products are described together <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are partners during DNA repair. The ERCC1-XPF nuclease is an essential activity in the pathway of DNA nucleotide excision repair (NER). The ERCC1-XPF nuclease also functions in pathways to repair double-strand breaks in DNA, and in the repair of [...] "crosslink" [...] damage that harmfully links the two DNA strands.|$|E
25|$|These {{drugs are}} listed <b>here</b> either <b>because</b> <b>they</b> {{are not very}} {{effective}} (e.g., clarithromycin) or because their efficacy has not been proven (e.g., linezolid, R207910). Rifabutin is effective, but is not included on the WHO list because for most developing countries, it is impractically expensive.|$|R
5000|$|Certain pure {{elements}} {{are found in}} Group 14 of the periodic table; the most commercially important of these {{elements are}} silicon and germanium. Silicon and germanium are used <b>here</b> effectively <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have 4 valence electrons in their outermost shell which gives them the ability to gain or lose electrons equally at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|These {{women came}} <b>here</b> today <b>because</b> <b>they</b> {{feel they are}} being lied to by our Government, and they feel their dissent is not being heard ... We want to let John Howardknow {{that we are not}} happy, and if it takes lying naked in a paddock to get the message across so be it. Grace Knight, 9 February 2003 ...|$|R
2500|$|The town name is {{pronounced}} [...] (like [...] "Dairy-Ann"), with {{stress on the}} last syllable, and {{has been referred to}} as such at least as far back as 1913. Residents say this is still the proper pronunciation, which in most American English, including the local variety, is more precisely [...] [...] "You can always tell when someone is not from <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> do pronounce it the way it's spelled," [...] Louise Berry, director of the town library, said in a 2006 interview.|$|E
2500|$|He {{continues}} to recognise and give support to young bands and artists in Australia. In a January 2007 interview with The Bulletin, Barnes spoke passionately about Australian rock musicians saying: [...] "Australian bands for me {{will always have}} the grunt. Grunt is what gives you longevity, strength, the power to believe in yourself. We have great bands <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> play live, they cut their teeth playing to people.". In March 2008, Barnes appeared as a special guest during soul singer Guy Sebastian's tour.|$|E
60|$|Ah, he thought, {{but they}} do want it. They have hidden it <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> intend {{returning}} for it later.|$|E
50|$|Although {{these are}} numerically the same {{coefficients}} used in sRGB above, {{the effect is}} different <b>because</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> are being applied directly to gamma-compressed values.|$|R
6000|$|Morton smiled grimly. [...] "They come <b>here</b> {{by night}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> {{would be dead}} men if they came here by day. They are criminals {{committing}} a crime that is more horrible here than theft or murder." ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{you may be}} aware, the Government {{has been}} making genuine efforts to allay the fears and the suspicions of the {{minorities}} and if their (Hindu minority's) exodus from Sindh still continues, it is Not <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are not wanted <b>here,</b> but <b>because</b> <b>they</b> {{are more prone to}} listen to people across the border who are interested in pulling them out. I am sorry for those misguided people for nothing but disillusionment awaits them in their 'PROMISED LAND'.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tain't {{my right}} name. They {{used to call}} me Phil at home, but the sailors all call me Polly <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> say I act like a girl." ...|$|E
60|$|Just {{before the}} arrival of this nocturnal visitor, one of the men had been engaged in some poetic effusions, which claim {{preliminary}} notice <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were rudely terminated by the lion.|$|E
6000|$|... "We never {{attack a}} castle without cannon," [...] Frank said. [...] "But {{if we had}} no cannon we might try to starve the people out; but you cannot do that <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> would land food from the sea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{are printed}} calculations,' said his companion, 'which {{will tell you}} pretty nearly how many people will pass up and down that {{thoroughfare}} {{in the course of}} a day. I can tell you how many of 'em will come in <b>here,</b> merely <b>because</b> <b>they</b> find this office here; knowing no more about it than they do of the Pyramids. Ha, ha! Join us. You shall come in cheap.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then it's all right?" [...] he {{returned}} deliberately. [...] "I brought 'em <b>here</b> <b>because</b> I thought <b>they</b> might give an idee where my wife was. For them letters {{is in her}} own handwrite. You remember ez I told ez how she was a scollard." ...|$|R
30|$|Parent: This {{attribute}} {{is relatively}} easier to predict, compared to Age, Education and Income, but not User Type. It {{is clear that}} social feature dominates the prediction performance, and significantly outperforms the cyber feature. As shown in Table  10, this is {{mainly because of the}} WithKids social group status. In addition, the physical, self-reported feature Children is also a good (and expected) indicator for users’ parental status. Logs-based features perform badly <b>here,</b> simply <b>because</b> <b>they</b> lack the social information.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is weary {{being here}} all alone, I must confess. Mrs G. {{says that she}} could not bear it for another twelve months. The girl we have has given us notice, and she is the ninth within a year. No {{followers}} will come after them <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> say they'll smell the dead bodies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I doubt it. If you could, {{folks would}} not flock {{to such an}} auction-sale as this. They come <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> can get things cheap--because they are not overcharged, {{as they are in}} some places--because they are told the truth about goods--because they like to see a boy get along in spite of what some mean man may do to take away his business--because they----" ...|$|E
60|$|They {{rest from}} their labours. All their struggles, disappointments, failures, backslidings, which made them unhappy <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> could not {{perfectly}} do {{the will of}} God, are past and over for ever. But their works follow them. The good which they did on earth--that is not past and over. It cannot die. It lives and grows for ever, following on in their path long after they are dead, and bearing fruit unto everlasting life, not only in them, but in men whom they never saw, and in generations yet unborn.|$|E
2500|$|Williams was {{inducted}} into the Baseball Hall of Fame on July 25, 1966. In his induction speech, Williams included a statement calling for the recognition of the great Negro Leagues players: [...] "I've been a very lucky guy to have worn a baseball uniform, and I hope some day the names of Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson in some way can be added {{as a symbol of the}} great Negro players who are not <b>here</b> only <b>because</b> <b>they</b> weren't given a chance." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bauram {{was settled}} {{at that time}} when India was {{under the rule of}} Mughal Empire by a Jagdeeshpur, Siwan&apos;s {{resident}} Laung Chaudhary. First he reached village &apos;Asi&apos; (3-4 km west to the village). His second or third generation discovered this place when they were searching for their cattle&apos;s feed. Here they found aheap of green grass. They also start <b>here</b> living <b>because</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> can easily form their shelter as here was also aheap of reeds. Where they formed there shacks now that colony is known as [...] "gaaon par (home)". As Laung Chaudhary was a Hindu (Brahmin) but he converted to a Muslim (seikh).|$|R
3000|$|... - Sure. Well (…) in Europe or in Africa, you know, {{campaigns are}} not the same. Here in Africa, {{you have to give}} [money] (…) you have to make them [the voters] understand. <b>Because,</b> <b>here,</b> <b>they</b> rely on {{migrants}} [émigrés] for their living. Politics… they don’t care about politics.|$|R
60|$|I take upon me, therefore, {{to assure}} my Reader, That whoever pleases {{to take a}} Journey, or Voyage, or Flight up to these Lunar Regions, as soon as ever he comes ashoar there, will {{presently}} be convinc'd, of the Reasonableness of Immaterial Substance, and the Immortality, as well as Immateriality of the Soul: He will no sooner look into these Explicating Glasses, but he will be-able to know the separate meaning of Body, Soul, Spirit, Life, Motion, Death, and a Thousand things that Wise-men puzzle themselves about <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are not Fools enough to understand.|$|E
6000|$|... "They do {{many things}} in this temple which they do not do elsewhere," [...] he replied. [...] "The Mahars of Phutra are not {{supposed}} to eat human flesh, yet slaves are brought here by thousands and almost always you will find Mahars on hand to consume them. I imagine that they do not bring their Sagoths <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are ashamed of the practice, which is supposed to obtain only among the least advanced of their race; but I would wager my canoe against a broken paddle that there is no Mahar but eats human flesh whenever she can get it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all," [...] Louis continued, helping {{himself to}} a cigarette, [...] "what is there {{in a place like}} this to amuse? We are not Americans or tourists. The Montmartre is finished. The novelists and the story-tellers have killed it. The women come <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> love to show their jewelry, to flirt with the men. The men come because their womankind desire it, and because it is their habit. But for the rest there is nothing. The true Parisian may come here, perhaps, once or twice a year,--no more. For the man of the world--such as you and I, monsieur,--these places do not exist." ...|$|E
50|$|We cannot {{go on like}} this. I do {{not care}} what those {{on this side of}} the House, or the Opposition side or {{anywhere}} else, say. Problems at local level will become worse and worse for our own people unless something is done. All hon. Members know that people come to their surgeries describing the most distressing conditions—terrifying conditions. People born and bred in their own constituencies have been on the housing waiting list for as long as six years. But, on the points system, one must give immigrants preference...People cannot come <b>here</b> just <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have a British passport—full stop.|$|R
6000|$|... "They will be Johnstons and Jardines, {{and wild}} wood folk of Galloway," [...] I said. [...] "These we scarce reckon Scots, but rather Picts, and half heathen. And the Johnstons and Jardines are <b>here</b> belike, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have made Scotland over hot to hold them. We are a poor folk, but honest, let by the clans of the Land Debatable and of Ettrick Forest, and the Border freebooters, and the Galloway Picts, and Maxwells, and Glendinnings, and the red-shanked, jabbering Highlanders and Islesmen, and some {{certain of the}} Angus folk, and, maybe, a wild crew in Strathclyde." ...|$|R
50|$|We use <b>here</b> arithmetical models <b>because</b> <b>they</b> {{are like}} the models of {{management}} accounting, illustrative and easily understood and applied in practice. Furthermore, they are integrated to management accounting, which is a practical advantage. A major advantage of the arithmetical model is its capability to depict production function {{as a part of}} production process. Consequently, production function can be understood, measured, and examined as a part of production process.|$|R
