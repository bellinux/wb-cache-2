5|$|The Wrongs of Woman {{begins in}} medias res with the upper-class Maria's unjust {{imprisonment}} by her husband, George Venables. Not only <b>has</b> <b>he</b> condemned Maria {{to live in}} an insane asylum, but he has also taken their child away from her. She manages to befriend one of her attendants in the asylum, an impoverished, lower-class woman named Jemima, who, after realizing that Maria is not mad, agrees to bring her a few books. Some of these have notes scribbled in them by Henry Darnford, another inmate, and Maria falls in love with him via his marginalia. The two begin to communicate and eventually meet. Darnford reveals that he has had a debauched life; waking up in the asylum after a night of heavy drinking, he has been unable to convince the doctors to release him.|$|E

25|$|Never {{during the}} last hundred years has a Governor of Bombay been so sternly criticised and never <b>has</b> <b>he</b> met with such {{widespread}} unpopularity on account of his administration as Lord Harris.|$|E
6000|$|She {{regarded}} her father {{that night with}} a want of natural affection terrible to record. Why <b>had</b> <b>he</b> come just when <b>he</b> <b>had,</b> just as <b>he</b> <b>had?</b> Why <b>had</b> <b>he</b> been so violent, so impossible? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{the price}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> set upon it! I {{was to be}} the comfort of his life to come. And it would have been so, <b>had</b> <b>he</b> not seen and <b>had</b> <b>he</b> not believed. Because another <b>has</b> loved, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> given up that which <b>he</b> <b>has</b> loved himself." ...|$|R
5000|$|Laidback Luke, {{a popular}} DJ, stated about Cesqeaux that [...] "He <b>has</b> showmanship, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> passion, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> looks, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> the voice—he's {{going to be}} big." ...|$|R
25|$|Furtwängler {{has never}} been a National Socialist. Nor <b>has</b> <b>he</b> ever made any bones about it. Which Jews and emigrants thought was {{sufficient}} to consider him as one of them, a key representative of so-called 'inner emigration'. Furtwängler stance towards us has not changed in the least.|$|E
25|$|Ventura's partner Laura arrives, {{planning}} {{to meet up}} with him. When Simon discovers that it was the pair who had plotted with Donati to kill his mother, he slowly strangles Laura to death. No sooner <b>has</b> <b>he</b> exacted his revenge than Simon himself is murdered by Albert. The wounded Frank suddenly reappears, but Albert succeeds in killing him after a brief struggle.|$|E
25|$|In a {{statement}} released on November 28, 2005, Dorgan responded by asserting {{that he has}} never personally met Jack Abramoff, nor <b>has</b> <b>he</b> ever received money from Abramoff. Dorgan did acknowledge receiving money from Abramoff's clients, but the donations began prior to their involvement with Abramoff. Dorgan's statement {{went on to say that}} he has supported the programs that benefited Abramoff's clients years prior to the contribution.|$|E
6000|$|Where <b>had</b> <b>he</b> {{been in his}} time? he repeated, when I {{asked him}} the question. Lord, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been everywhere! And what <b>had</b> <b>he</b> been? Bless you, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been {{everything}} you could mention a'most! ...|$|R
5000|$|He's been by far {{the best}} player by a large margin (in camp). <b>He</b> <b>has</b> {{dominated}} everything. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> scored. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> rebounded. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> defended well. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> a surprisingly high basketball IQ. He shoots really well and pursues every offensive rebound. — Former Indiana Pacers coach Jim O'Brien, speaking of Magnum Rolle ...|$|R
60|$|Not {{for nothing}} <b>had</b> <b>he</b> endured that agony, {{and not for}} nothing <b>had</b> <b>he</b> {{struggled}} {{in the grip of}} doubt.|$|R
25|$|One such {{position}} is Obama's stance on health care. Obama has repeatedly {{said that he}} wants to see that every American has the option of having affordable health care as good as every U. S. Senator <b>has.</b> <b>He</b> has proposed a major overhaul of the nation’s health care system, aimed at covering the nearly 45 million uninsured Americans, reducing premium costs for everyone else, and breaking what he asserted was “the stranglehold” that the biggest drug and insurance companies have on the health care market.|$|E
25|$|Socrates asks {{questions}} of Agathon: <b>has</b> <b>he</b> {{referred to the}} object of love, or love itself? Socrates then relates a story he was told by a wise woman called Diotima. According to her, Eros is not a god, but is a spirit that mediates between humans and their objects of desire. Love itself is not wise or beautiful, but is the desire for those things. Love is expressed through propagation and reproduction: either physical love or the exchanging and reproducing of ideas. The greatest knowledge, Diotima says, is knowledge of the “form of beauty”, which humans must try to achieve.|$|E
25|$|La Luz {{has never}} worked for, nor <b>has</b> <b>he</b> held a staff {{position}} with Latinos for Barack Obama. He has, however, been “on loan” from AFSCME – a practice done regularly by key labor organizations {{across the country}} - and was assigned to assist in Hillary Clinton’s primary election campaign in several states with large Puerto Rican communities and in Puerto Rico where he {{played a pivotal role}} in Hillary’s victorious campaign. He also became one of the trainers in a political boot camp called Latino Camp Obama for Hispanic activists and volunteers who were trained in the political skills and the basics of organizing at the grassroots level.|$|E
60|$|From {{his point}} of view <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a right to be genial; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a right to be pleased with the scenery and the air; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a right to swear at the Scotchman, and to ask him why he did not put on a merrier visage on such a {{sparkling}} morning, for since <b>he</b> <b>had</b> first started out as Captain Thomas of the Royal James <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been a most successful pirate. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> sailed up the Virginia coast; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> burned, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> sunk, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> robbed, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> slain; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> gone up the Delaware Bay, and the people in ships and the people on the coasts trembled even when they heard that his black flag had been sighted.|$|R
60|$|Loneliness {{struck him}} like a blow. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> dependents, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> cares. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> never a soul to whom he might weep....|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry, indeed, to {{hear that}} <b>he</b> <b>has</b> fallen, Juan. I feared that <b>he</b> <b>had,</b> for <b>he</b> would not <b>have</b> let you be captured, <b>had</b> <b>he</b> been alive.|$|R
25|$|The 2014/2015 {{season was}} a year of quarter-finals for Fu <b>has</b> <b>he</b> played in seven but could never win one. His first came in the opening ranking event, the Wuxi Classic, where he lost 5–4 to Barry Hawkins. He was knocked {{out in the first}} round of the Shanghai Masters, but saw off Liam Highfield, David Gilbert and Rod Lawler at the International Championship, before a ranking event quarter-final went the {{distance}} for the second time this season as Fu lost 6–5 to Robert Milkins. He was whitewashed 6–0 by Ronnie O'Sullivan in the last eight of the non-ranking Champion of Champions. Another quarter-final followed at the UK Championship after Fu came back from 5–3 down to eliminate Shaun Murphy 6–5, with both players criticising the condition of the table after the match. He was knocked out 6–4 by Stephen Maguire.|$|E
25|$|On July 31, 2011, Marshall {{announced}} {{at a press}} conference that he had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and that he hopes to spread awareness and understanding about the illness. Marshall said his entire professional career and adult personal life has been marred with symptoms of BPD, but only recently through treatment <b>has</b> <b>he</b> learned to consciously and effectively deal with the resulting problems of his actions that have been influenced by BPD. Marshall cited a recent study that suggests at least 35% of male prison inmates nationally, and 25% of female inmates, have been diagnosed with BPD. He said he hopes to help reduce the stigma of BPD, and encourage and lead others with the disorder to receive proper care. On October 10, 2013, Marshall donned a pair of bright green Nike cleats in support of Mental Illness Awareness Week. Marshall pledged to donate any fine he incurred from the NFL to charity, an estimated $5,250.|$|E
25|$|The Ultimate Universe {{version of}} Blob, real name Franklin Dukes, {{is a member}} of the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy. His powers are similar to that of his Earth-616 counterpart, {{although}} he has been moved by a helicopter during the Weapon X saga, suggesting that he may be less powerful. He seems to eat constantly, and is often seen browsing the internet or chatting to people via instant messaging. One such incident sees the Blob pretend to be a female model/physicist named Naomi who cyber-seduces the X-Man Beast—leading to the discovery of Magneto's survival and to the Ultimate War saga. Unlike his Earth-616 counterpart, the Blob may very well have additional superhuman-eating powers as part of his mutation, as not only <b>has</b> <b>he</b> threatened to actually eat his enemies alive, but it was expressly stated that he had personally consumed all of the Weapon X computers in a matter of moments when the Brotherhood invaded the Weapon X compound to rescue the X-Men. In Ultimatum, the Blob is seen eating the Wasp, proving the cannibalistic claims are true. However, Hank Pym grows to a gigantic size and bites the Blob's head off in return.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> {{crossed the}} path of Vaughn Steele; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> blocked the way of this Texas Ranger. If <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{intelligence}} and remembered Steele's fame, which surely <b>he</b> <b>had,</b> then <b>he</b> <b>had</b> some appreciation of what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> undertaken.|$|R
60|$|But she'd know {{something}} <b>had</b> happened, because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{promised to be}} there at eight. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> told her what team he'd <b>have.</b> (<b>He</b> <b>had</b> forgotten at this moment the doubt and distrust <b>he</b> <b>had</b> given her on Monday.) She'd know he'd surely come.|$|R

500|$|Eaton: [...] "Have {{you ever}} seen {{anything}} {{in the conduct of}} General Babcock, or <b>has</b> <b>he</b> ever said anything to you, which indicated to your mind that he was in any way interested in or concerned with the Whiskey Ring at St. Louis or elsewhere?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{trustees}} then ordered Atlas to stop inviting black clergymen to {{his weekly}} Hebrew class, [...] "make no further speeches or statements outside the synagogue", and, as long <b>has</b> <b>he</b> was rabbi there, [...] "disassociate [...] from the Negroes completely". Atlas again refused, and the trustees responded by shunning him, refusing {{to visit his}} home, and literally turning their backs on {{him when he was}} around.|$|E
500|$|Ono {{was pleased}} that Jackson had {{acquired}} Northern Songs and called it a [...] "blessing". Speaking in November 1990, Ono stated, [...] "Businessmen who aren't artists themselves wouldn't have the consideration Michael <b>has.</b> <b>He</b> loves the songs. He's very caring." [...] She added that if she and McCartney were to own the songs, there would certainly be arguments. Ono explained that neither she nor McCartney needed that. [...] "If Paul got the songs, people would have said, 'Paul finally got John.' And if I got them, they'd say, 'Oh, the dragon lady strikes again.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Questions {{formed in}} Lane's mind, {{questions}} that seemed put by a dawning significance. Why <b>had</b> <b>he</b> heard the cry for help? Why <b>had</b> <b>he</b> found the boat? Why had the drowning man {{proved to be}} one of two men on earth he hated, one of the two men whom he wanted to kill? Why <b>had</b> <b>he</b> drifted into the rapids? Why <b>had</b> <b>he</b> come safely through a vortex of death? Why had Swann's lips formed that prayer? Why had the oars remained in the boat? ...|$|R
60|$|Uriah Risley {{was pale}} and haggard and said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not slept for two nights, nor <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a regular meal for forty-eight hours. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> been to the {{vicinity}} of his burnt cabin and had followed up Henry's trail {{as best he could}} for several miles, but nowhere <b>had</b> <b>he</b> found a trace of his wife.|$|R
60|$|M. de La Tour d'Azyr never heeded {{him or his}} stare; nor, <b>had</b> <b>he</b> done so, would <b>he</b> <b>have</b> known who it {{was that}} looked at him from behind the make-up of Scaramouche; nor, again, <b>had</b> <b>he</b> known, would <b>he</b> <b>have</b> been in the least troubled or concerned.|$|R
500|$|Choudary {{has been}} largely criticised by most UK newspapers, some of whom {{describe}} him as an extremist, or radical cleric or preacher. In January 2010, Guardian contributor Mehdi Hasan wrote: [...] "Is Choudary an Islamic scholar whose views merit attention or consideration? No. <b>Has</b> <b>he</b> studied under leading Islamic scholars? Nope. Does he have any Islamic qualifications or credentials? None whatsoever. So what gives him the right to pontificate on Islam, British Muslims or 'the hellfire'? Or proclaim himself a 'sharia judge'?", and claimed that Choudary was [...] "as unrepresentative of British Muslim opinion, as he is of British anti-war opinion." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} an {{interview}} with Williams, where he is asked about his real persona and his stage one. Then it cuts to him dressing up {{in a suit and}} going onstage to sing the song {{in front of an audience}} of drag queens. Thomas Rogers from Salon criticized the video for portraying drag queens like [...] "patients in a mental ward" [...] as well as the interview sequence, which he felt equated drag queens as people with multiple personality disorder. A writer for Metro questioned [...] "Is Robbie trying to send us a message? Or <b>has</b> <b>he</b> just got extremely carried away playing dress up in his mother's wardrobe." ...|$|E
500|$|With Barnes injured, Hassett {{moved up}} from the middle order to open the innings with Morris. Using the new ball, Bedser removed Morris, who chipped {{the ball in the}} air to Cranston at mid-wicket and fell for six to leave Australia at 13/1. This brought Bradman to the crease and he was mobbed by the spectators on a ground where he had scored two triple centuries in Tests in 1930 and 1934. Many spectators surged onto the playing arena to greet Bradman, and he doffed his baggy green and raised his bat to {{acknowledge}} them. Fingleton wrote [...] "on this field he [...] has won his greatest honours; nowhere else <b>has</b> <b>he</b> been so idolatrously acclaimed".|$|E

60|$|He did not {{say that}} he was a blighted being, because the word <b>had,</b> <b>he</b> thought, become ridiculous; but <b>he</b> would <b>have</b> used it <b>had</b> <b>he</b> dared, as expressing most {{accurately}} his condition.|$|R
