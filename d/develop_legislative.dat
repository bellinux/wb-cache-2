40|$|The Patient's Charter {{has been}} in effect for nearly five years. This article {{considers}} the purpose and value of the document through a comparison with the New Jersey Patient Bill of Rights. Patient rights statements have been posted in American hospitals {{for more than twenty}} years. However, the New Jersey document and the patient rights programme it established seven years ago, have proven to be economically effective, successful in their representation of patients and enforceable, due to the adoption of state legislation and regulation to oversee the process. Several examples of how the programme works are included in the comparison, with a similar review of The Patient's Charter. In the comparison the author argues that for the programme to succeed as it has done in New Jersey, the government will need to <b>develop</b> <b>legislative</b> backing to ensure enforcement, and an efficient system for monitoring compliance. The programme will need to become credible {{in the eyes of the}} health service user. The author suggests this may be best achieved by developing an efficient, accessible and user-friendly means of redress, should the patient consider his or her rights have been violated. A "mish-mash" of quality assurance standards and levels of care which patients can "expect" from the health service providers only serves to distract the health service user from the government's failure to commit the resources that would empower the patients rights portion of The Patient's Charter...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the dispute settlement proceedings pending before the World Trade Organization (WTO) concerning the Fairness in Music License Act of 1998, a new {{provision of the}} US Copyright Act that exempts many bars, restaurants, and retail stores from paying license fees for performing broadcast music in their establishments. In May 1999, the European Community challenged the Act, and its predecessor 2 ̆ 2 homestyle exemption, 2 ̆ 2 {{as a violation of}} the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) and the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (Berne). The FMLA dispute {{is the first time in}} history that US copyright laws will be judged by an international tribunal. The case is an embarrassing one for the United States, which has recently pursued a policy of aggressively encouraging other nations to provide strong legal protections for copyrighted works. Although officials within the Clinton Administration warned legislators that the Fairness in Music Licensing Act might be incompatible with the Berne and TRIPs treaties, Congress enacted the statute over their objections. Thus, in the first year of the new century, Congress may be faced with an unprecedented choice: modify the Copyright Act to satisfy the demands of international trade jurists or face retaliatory trade sanctions by the EC. In addition to analyzing the legal arguments available to the US and the EC under the Berne and TRIPs treaties, this article also seeks to explain why Congress deliberately chose to ignore past US intellectual property policy. Using insights from law and economics and from a study of the history of laws and licensing practices governing secondary uses of broadcast music, the article demonstrates how an increasingly broad free use exemption developed for businesses playing radio and television music. It then draws on these economic and historical insights to <b>develop</b> <b>legislative</b> reform proposals that are both compatible with United States 2 ̆ 7 treaty obligations and that encourage performance rights organizations and associations of copyright users to reach an efficient private agreement to resolve the WTO dispute...|$|E
40|$|More {{than ten}} {{million people are}} {{stateless}} today. In a world of nation states, they live on the margins without membership in any state, and, as a consequence, have few enforceable legal rights. Stateless individuals face gaps in protection {{and in many cases}} experience persecution that falls within the refugee paradigm. However, US asylum policy does not adequately address the myriad legal problems that confront the stateless, who have been largely invisible in the jurisprudence and academic literature.   Two federal appellate court opinions shed new light on the intersection of statelessness and refugee law in the United States. In 2010, Haile v. Holder examined the asylum claim of a young man rendered stateless when the Ethiopian government issued a decree denationalizing ethnic Eritreans.   In a 2011 case, Stserba v. Holder, the court reviewed an asylum claim by a woman who became stateless when the Soviet Union collapsed, and the successor state of Estonia enacted citizenship legislation that included a language requirement. This article analyzes the opinions which suggest that state action depriving residents of citizenship on ethnic and other protected grounds warrants a presumption of persecution.   This article also identifies additional circumstances in which stateless individuals may have a well-founded fear of persecution that qualifies them for asylum in the United States. In addition, this article notes that although far too many stateless individuals face persecution, not all of them do. Stateless persons who do not fear persecution, however, are also vulnerable. The absence of state protection condemns them to a precarious existence and their inability to obtain passports or other travel documents often prevents their return to states where they formerly resided. The refusal of most states to admit noncitizens frequently keeps stateless persons in limbo. Stateless individuals stranded in the United States live under a supervisory patchwork that serves neither their interests nor those of the United States.   Rather than relying on incremental case law developments and inapposite regulatory schemes, the US State Department and the Department of Homeland Security should convene a task force to report on the size and composition of the stateless population in the United States and the need to <b>develop</b> <b>legislative,</b> regulatory, and other policy guidance concerning statelessness claims.   </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{framework}} and a specific {{proposal for the}} re-regulation of key components of the U. S. financial system {{in the aftermath of}} the subprime mortgage crisis. It begins with a review of those aspects of the subprime crisis that required the large, observed government interventions, namely the feared bankruptcy of individual banks, insurers, and government sponsored enterprises with the potential to create a meltdown of the entire financial system. The paper then <b>develops</b> <b>legislative</b> responses that would make future systemic failures and bailouts of this magnitude highly unlikely. The paper’s key analytic device is to distinguish two financial firm activities: (1) risky investment activities (“hedge fund ” division) capable of causing firm bankruptcy, and (2) market-making and related activities (“infrastructure ” division), the failure of which would have systemic implications. The goal of the proposed regulatory change is to ensure that the infrastructure division is bankruptcy remote and can operate on a stand-alone basis if necessary even when losses from the hedge fund division threaten the holding company’s solvency.

Child abuse, as one form of gross infringement of abovementioned right, is a social and legal concern that is centuries old and seriously combated in most civilisations, but the occurrence of this type of criminal behaviour is rapidly increasing.

40|$|Summary: The main {{consequences}} for the veterinary medicinal product sector of the recent wave of liberalisation in Africa’s livestock sector have been a proliferation of operators, a diversification of product origin and a general decline in product quality. In this context, all the stakeholders involved agree that legislation on veterinary medicinal products needs to be harmonised among the African countries. Despite this consensus, however, the situation has not changed much in the countries themselves. In order to explore operational guidelines for harmonising national legislation in Africa, with particular reference to the registration and quality control of veterinary medicinal products, the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) drew up a status report on the member countries of the OIE Regional Commission for Africa based on the answers to a questionnaire.
