Cranor also expanded the chain into non-traditional locations, beginning with a 150 sq ft limited menu kiosk at a General Motors assembly plant in Dayton, Ohio. Between 1986 and 1991, the chain built a further 2,000 outlets to bring its total number to 8,500, and sales grew from $3.5 to $6.2 billion. The chain {{had to contend with}} the rise of grilled chicken as Americans became increasingly health conscious. KFC found itself competing against the growing El Pollo Loco restaurant chain, as well as with Burger King, which had just introduced the BK Broiler, a grilled chicken burger. Delays <b>in</b> <b>product</b> development, cramped kitchens and the ongoing franchisee contract dispute prevented the chain from rolling out a grilled product of its own.|$|E

Creativity and design in particular (as an activity: design skills, methods and processes) play a growing role in creating products and services with high added value to consumers.

The creative industry workforce is 3.1% of total employment in the European Union (EU), which creates a revenue that is 2.6% of the EU gross value.

(The paper may be viewed as a sequel to [K-K-S 1]; majority of its content is an improved version of a portion of [K-K-S].) We show that if X is a locally connected, so-called, quasi n-manifold lying <b>in</b> a <b>product</b> of n curves then rank H 1 (X) ≥ n.
