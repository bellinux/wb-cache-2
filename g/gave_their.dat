5|$|Before the Romans {{arrived in}} Britain, the land now forming {{the county of}} Carmarthenshire {{was part of the}} kingdom of the Demetae who <b>gave</b> <b>their</b> name to the county of Dyfed; it {{contained}} one of their chief settlements, Moridunum, now known as Carmarthen. The Romans established two forts in South Wales, one at Caerwent to control the southeast of the country, and one at Carmarthen to control the southwest. The fort at Carmarthen dates from around 75 AD, and there is a Roman amphitheatre nearby, so this probably makes Carmarthen the oldest continually occupied town in Wales.|$|E
5|$|Brunel and Gooch both <b>gave</b> <b>their</b> {{locomotives}} {{names to}} identify them, but the standard-gauge companies {{that became a}} part of the GWR used numbers. Until 1864 the GWR therefore had named broad-gauge locomotives and numbered standard-gauge ones. From the time of Armstrong's arrival all new locomotives– both broad and standard– were given numbers, including broad-gauge ones that had previously carried names when they were acquired from other railways. Dean introduced a policy in 1895 of giving passenger tender locomotives both numbers and names. Each batch was given names with a distinctive theme, for example kings for the 6000 class and castles for the 4073 class.|$|E

Clifton continued to write letters to the Colonial Secretary advocating the construction of a road.|$|E
