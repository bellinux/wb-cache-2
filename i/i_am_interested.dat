500|$|The Ring production, filmed for {{television}} in 1980, initially provoked controversy, but was celebrated after its final performance in 1980 with a 45-minute standing ovation. Chéreau disliked grand opera, but said: [...] "After Bayreuth, I {{felt the need}} to work on a theatrical project of some breadth... I have never put on little things. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> only in spectacles that rise above themselves". He first considered Goethe's Faust but then directed in 1981 Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt for Villeurbane and Paris, aiming at [...] "an incandescence of theatrical experience, a global spectacle".|$|E
500|$|... "What {{interests}} {{me is the}} defining features of Gregory's vision of the just society: his unequivocal stance against 'the peculiar institution of slavery' and his call for the manumission of all slaves. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in reading Gregory as a fourth century abolitionist intellectual....His outlook surpassed not only St. Paul's more moderate (but {{to be fair to}} Paul, in his moment, revolutionary) stance on the subject but also those of all ancient intellectuals -- Pagan, Jewish and Christian - from Aristotle to Cicero and from Augustine in the Christian West to his contemporary, the golden mouthed preacher himself, John Crysotom in the East. Indeed, the world would have to wait another fifteen centuries -- until the nineteenth century, late into the modern abolitionist movement -- before such an unequivocal stance against slavery would appear again." ...|$|E

On the other hand the pupil through reading entry {{into the world of}} imagination and stories. Major role in motivating students to read have parents and teachers. In this graduation thesis <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> in how third grade teachers motivate their pupils to read. In doing so, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> focused mainly to reading for required reading and The Reading Badge. Without real motivation in today's technology era pupils could replace a book with a computer or other modern electronic media. In the theoretical part I focused on reading and reading motivation for required reading and The Reading Badge. About reading <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> in reading definition, reading comprehension, types and importance of reading, types of readers and teaching. About motivation <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> in its definition, factors and promote reading motivation at home and at school. About required reading and Reading Badge <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> in the meaning and goals. About required reading <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> in how <b>is</b> it placed into the curriculum.

500|$|Roddenberry {{was raised}} a Southern Baptist; however, as an adult, he {{rejected}} religion, and considered himself a humanist. He began questioning religion around {{the age of}} 14, {{and came to the}} conclusion that it was [...] "nonsense". As a child, he served in the choir at his local church, but often substituted lyrics as he sang hymns. Early in his writing career, he received an award from the American Baptist Convention for [...] "skillfully writing Christian truth and the application of Christian principles into commercial, dramatic TV scripts". For several years, he corresponded with John M. Gunn of the National Council of Churches regarding the application of Christian teachings in television series. However, Gunn stopped replying after Roddenberry wrote in a letter: [...] "But you must understand that I am a complete pagan, and consume enormous amounts of bread, having found the Word more spice than nourishment, so <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in a statement couched in dollars and cents of what this means to the Roddenberry treasury." ...|$|E

5000|$|Of the play, Baker said, [...] "I {{wrote it}} {{during a period}} of {{crippling}} self-hatred and depression, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>interested</b> in how, even if you’re a well-intentioned depressed person, you can still really screw up the lives of everyone around you just through the things that being depressed can make you say. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> also <b>interested</b> in what we mean when we say ‘depressed.’ <b>I</b> <b>was</b> also <b>interested</b> in the way liberal-seeming white people talk about black people when they’re not around." ...|$|R

"It is {{important}} that you have outside interests, but {{it is even more}} important that you have great interest in your profession, that you see it on the high plane where it belongs in order that you may have pride in it. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in education because it is the only hope in a [...] democratic country like ours.

2500|$|Writing {{about her}} first years in Hollywood, Life {{magazine}} stated that [...] "All Bergman vehicles are blessed," [...] and [...] "they all go speedily and happily, with no temperament from the leading lady." [...] She was [...] "completely pleased" [...] with her early career's management by David O. Selznick, who always found excellent dramatic roles {{for her to}} play, and equally satisfied with her salary, once saying, [...] "I am an actress and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in acting, not in making money."

2500|$|Jeffries {{remained}} mostly {{hidden from}} media attention {{until the day}} of the fight, while Johnson soaked up the spotlight. John L. Sullivan, who made boxing championships a popular and esteemed spectacle, stated that Johnson was in such good physical shape compared to Jeffries that he could lose only if he had a lack of skill on the day. Before the fight, Jeffries remarked, [...] "It is my intention to go right after my opponent and knock him out as soon as possible." [...] While his wife added, [...] "I'm not interested in prizefighting but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in my husband's welfare, I do hope this will be his last fight."

2500|$|Describing mid-20th-century Britain, {{the books}} follow {{the life of}} Frederica Potter, a young {{intellectual}} studying at Cambridge {{at a time when}} women were heavily outnumbered by men at that university, and then tracing her journey as a divorcée with a young son making a new life in London. Byatt says some of the characters in her fiction represent her [...] "greatest terror which is simple domesticity [...] I had this image of coming out from under and seeing the light for a bit and then being shut in a kitchen, which I think happened to women of my generation." [...] Like Babel Tower, A Whistling Woman touches on the utopian and revolutionary dreams of the 1960s. She describes herself as [...] "a naturally pessimistic animal": [...] "I don't believe that human beings are basically good, so I think all utopian movements are doomed to fail, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in them." ...|$|E
2500|$|These traits come to {{the fore}} in Hi, Mom!s [...] "Be Black, Baby" [...] {{sequence}}. This sequence parodies cinéma vérité, the dominant documentary tradition of the 1960s, while simultaneously providing the audience with a visceral and disturbingly emotional experience. De Palma describes the sequence as a constant invocation of Brechtian distanciation: [...] "First of all, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in the medium of film itself, and I am constantly standing outside and making people aware that they are always watching a film. At the same time I am evolving it. In Hi, Mom! for instance, there is a sequence where you are obviously watching a ridiculous documentary and you are told that and you are aware of it, but it still sucks you in. There is a kind of Brechtian alienation idea here: you are aware of what you are watching {{at the same time that}} you are emotionally involved with it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gartside's {{change in}} beliefs {{directly}} affected {{the music and}} particularly the lyrics of Songs to Remember. In one interview with NME in October 1981 he told the paper, [...] "The politics have moved from an essentialist and reductionist position in which we believed in a history of science which could {{make sense of the}} future to one that realized that what you've got is needs, demands, and desires, and you go out and you fight for them. Which means that your music will at points be indexed fairly clearly to Politics with a big 'P' and at other points will cut across it completely." [...] In another interview with The Face the following year Gartside said, [...] "My loss has been political conviction, the idea of a correct understanding of the past, present and future (Marxism). I've always been obsessively concerned that my understanding of political truth should be scientifically grounded. Many songs [...] are about what happens when the anchor points of political, moral or religious understanding fall away." [...] For example, he stated that the track [...] "Faithless" [...] was about [...] "how living without faith brings you both happiness and sadness. I've never had any religion, except maybe politics, although <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in having some means of achieving social order and progress." ...|$|E
