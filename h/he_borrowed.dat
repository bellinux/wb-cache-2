5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s, Berry {{was working with}} local bands in clubs in St. Louis as an extra source of income. He had been playing blues since his teens, and <b>he</b> <b>borrowed</b> both guitar riffs and {{showmanship}} techniques from the blues musician T-Bone Walker. He also took guitar lessons from his friend Ira Harris, which {{laid the foundation for}} his guitar style.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Dave Tough and Jo Jones, Manne admired and learned from contemporaries like Max Roach and Kenny Clarke, and later from younger drummers like Elvin Jones and Tony Williams. Consciously or unconsciously, <b>he</b> <b>borrowed</b> a little {{from all of}} them, always searching to extend his playing into new territory.|$|E
5|$|Always {{one of the}} {{smallest}} children in his class and without stable supervision at home, Fleury adopted an aggressive posture and later described himself as a bully. He turned to hockey as an outlet when <b>he</b> <b>borrowed</b> an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first game at the age of five. From that point on, he played hockey at every opportunity, often accompanying his father to the arena in Russell in the pre-dawn hours. He was described by his teachers as a determined youth, who would repeat any activity he failed at until he got it right.|$|E
50|$|Ghanada never admits any {{donation}} or unconditional help. In case of necessity, <b>he</b> only <b>borrows</b> {{and keeps}} count. At first <b>he</b> <b>borrows</b> cigarettes arbitrarily from {{the residents of}} the mess; but in the story Nuri, <b>he</b> <b>borrows</b> only from Shishir. The due count of cigarettes (from Shishir) in Machh is 2357, and that in Chhori is 3298.|$|R

5|$|By early 1933, Bell's {{opinion on}} the NFL had changed, {{and he wanted to}} become an owner of a team based in Philadelphia. After being advised by the NFL that a {{prerequisite}} to a franchise being rendered in Philadelphia was that the Pennsylvania Blue Laws would have to be mollified, he was the force majeure in lobbying to getting the laws deprecated. <b>He</b> <b>borrowed</b> funds from Frances Upton, partnered with Wray, and he procured the rights to a franchise in Philadelphia which he christened as the Philadelphia Eagles.|$|E
5|$|During Qandil's boyhood, <b>he</b> <b>borrowed</b> {{and read}} books {{from a medical}} {{practice}} and a culture and sporting association in Tanta on a near weekly basis. He also learned field hockey there. Qandil {{was at the top}} of his class throughout his later school years and initially sought to enter the medical profession, a typical career aspiration for students with high marks. His mother particularly encouraged him to become a doctor. Qandil simultaneously took an interest in writing, Arabic calligraphy and foreign languages.|$|E
5|$|Maximilian of Habsburg, who {{had also}} laid claim to Hungary after Matthias Corvinus's death, invaded Hungary in November. <b>He</b> <b>borrowed</b> 30,000 gold florins from the wealthy Ernuszt and offered the Archbishopric of Salzburg to him. Ernuszt entered into {{negotiations}} with Reinprecht von Reichenburg, the commanders of Maximilian's army in Hungary, but refrained from providing military assistance to him against Vladislaus' troops. Instead, he stayed at Pécs and Đurđevac and came to an agreement with Ladislaus Egervári, Ban of Croatia, over the mutual defense of their estates.|$|E

5|$|On December 28, {{while walking}} between saloons on Allen Street in Tombstone, Virgil was ambushed and maimed by a shotgun round that struck {{his left arm}} and shoulder. Ike Clanton's hat {{was found in the}} back of the {{building}} across Allen Street from where the shots were fired. Wyatt wired U.S. Marshal Crawley P. Dake asking to be appointed deputy U.S. marshal with authority to select his own deputies. Dake granted the request in late January and provided the Earps with some funds <b>he</b> <b>borrowed</b> from Wells, Fargo & Co. on behalf of the Earps, variously reported as $500 to $3,000.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} from France, Edward found his {{political}} position greatly strengthened. After intense negotiation, the earls, including Lancaster and Warwick, came to a compromise in October 1313, fundamentally {{very similar to the}} draft agreement of the previous December. Edward's finances improved, thanks to parliament agreeing to the raising of taxes, a loan of 160,000 florins (£25,000) from the Pope, £33,000 that <b>he</b> <b>borrowed</b> from Philip, and further loans organised by Edward's new Italian banker, Antonio Pessagno. For {{the first time in his}} reign, Edward's government was well-funded.|$|E
5|$|Pound was in Rome {{early in}} September when Italy surrendered. <b>He</b> <b>borrowed</b> {{a pair of}} hiking boots and a {{knapsack}} and left the city, having finally decided to tell Mary about his wife and son. Heading north, he spent a night in an air-raid shelter in Bologna, then took a train to Verona and walked {{the rest of the}} way; he apparently traveled over 450 miles in all. Mary almost failed to recognize him when he arrived, he was so dirty and tired. He told her everything about his other family; she later admitted she felt more pity than anger.|$|E

5|$|Unable to {{convince}} Fermi {{that this was}} the case, Szilard set out on his own. He obtained permission from the head of the Physics Department at Columbia, George B. Pegram, to use a laboratory for three months. To fund his experiment, <b>he</b> <b>borrowed</b> $2,000 from a fellow inventor, Benjamin Liebowitz. He wired Frederick Lindemann at Oxford and asked him to send a beryllium cylinder. He convinced Walter Zinn to become his collaborator, and hired Semyon Krewer to investigate processes for manufacturing pure uranium and graphite.|$|E
5|$|Adam used a {{wide variety}} of sources for his designs, and created an inventive {{personal}} style of decoration. His chief influences were from English Palladianism, and several of his houses have been likened to designs reproduced in Colen Campbell's Vitruvius Britannicus, but Adam mixed these with English Baroque motifs from Gibbs and Vanbrugh. He relied greatly on a range of French, Italian and English pattern books, including Gibbs' Book of Architecture, from which <b>he</b> <b>borrowed</b> freely with little regard for consistency of style. In addition, he took inspiration from earlier Scottish renaissance architecture, and from his predecessors Bruce and Smith. During his nearly 30-year career as an architect, Adam designed, extended or remodelled over 40 country houses, and undertook numerous public contracts. He also laid out landscape garden schemes, for instance at Newliston and Taymouth Castle.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Rayalavari Karunakruthyamu, Krishnasastri's script {{also took}} {{inspiration}} from Devan Sharar's short story, The Emperor and the Slave Girl, {{which was published}} in the now defunct magazine, The Illustrated Weekly of India. It was Narasimha Reddy's practice to credit the authors of works from which <b>he</b> <b>borrowed</b> the basic premise for a film, but in this film, that was not the case. Krishnasastry revealed the fact in an interview with Vijayachitra magazine after Narasimha Reddy's death in 1977. However, in the film's opening credits, Buchibabu was listed as the film's writer along with Krishnasastri. Adi M. Irani and B.N. Konda Reddy were the film's cinematographers; S. Rajeswara Rao and Addepalli Ramarao composed the film's music; H.R. Narayana and Vasu edited the film. A.K. Shekhar was the film's production designer and Thota Tharani father Thota Venkateswara Rao assisted him.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Harry {{obtained}} a place at Liverpool's College of Art at 68 Hope Street. After studying typography and page layouts, <b>he</b> <b>borrowed</b> the college's duplicating machine and published a newspaper called Jazz in 1958, which reported concerts at the Liverpool Jazz Society club, the Temple Jazz Club and the Cavern Club. He also worked as assistant editor on University of Liverpool's charity magazine, Pantosphinx, and on a music newsletter for Frank Hessy's musical instruments store called Frank Comments. The title was suggested by the owner, Frank Hesselberg, as a play on his own comments, but was abandoned after a few issues.|$|E
5|$|By April 1945, the Allied advance into Germany {{threatened}} Hinton's POW camp. The Germans evacuated {{the camp}} but Hinton, feigning sickness, remained behind. Once the guards had left, {{he was able}} to find keys to the gates and let himself out. He soon made contact with soldiers of the United States 6th Armoured Division. Dressed in civilian clothes, he was initially treated with suspicion but soon convinced the Americans of his identity. <b>He</b> <b>borrowed</b> an American uniform and went forward to the frontline with the 44th Infantry Division and assisted in the capture of three villages and rounding up of German POWs. Senior American officers soon found out about Hinton's presence with their troops and sent him to England, where he arrived on 12 April 1945.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as a student, Gaudí was able to study a {{collection}} of photographs of Egyptian, Indian, Persian, Mayan, Chinese and Japanese art owned by the School of Architecture. The collection also included Moorish monuments in Spain, which left a deep mark on him and served as an inspiration in many of his works. He also studied the book Plans, elevations, sections and details of the Alhambra by Owen Jones, which <b>he</b> <b>borrowed</b> from the School's library. He took various structural and ornamental solutions from nazarí and mudéjar art, which he used with variations and stylistic freedom in his works. Notably, Gaudí observed of Islamic art its spatial uncertainty, its concept of structures with limitless space; its feeling of sequence, fragmented with holes and partitions, which create a divide without disrupting the feeling of open space by enclosing it with barriers.|$|E

5|$|From 1932 to 1934, Spedding {{worked for}} Lewis as a {{chemistry}} instructor. Around this time, he {{became interested in}} the chemistry of the rare earths. These were expensive and hard to find, and generally available only in minute amounts. In 1933 he won the Irving Langmuir Award for most outstanding young chemist. The award came with a cash prize of $1,000. <b>He</b> <b>borrowed</b> money to travel to Chicago to collect it. While he was there, he was approached by a man offering several pounds of Europium and Samarium. His benefactor was Herbert Newby McCoy, a retired chemistry professor from the University of Chicago, who had obtained a supply of these elements from the Lindsey Light and Chemical Company, where they were a byproduct of thorium production. A few weeks later, Spedding received a package in the mail containing jars of the metals.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Rush {{moved his}} family to Sydney. The Banks Crash reduced many Australian {{businessmen}} to ruin, Rush included. His business was built on credit alone: Rush did not even own the Grafton house {{where he and his}} family lived, having mortgaged it from the man who sold it to him. <b>He</b> <b>borrowed</b> from local banks, using his store-keeping business as security. In Sydney, Rush took a lease on the York Hotel, at the corner of King and York Streets, which quickly became known as 'Mick Rush's Hotel', a popular venue for meetings of sportsmen. During the next decade, Rush kept several hotels in the city of Sydney, and operated also as a hotel broker.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 The Map of Love {{appeared}} {{as a collection of}} 16 poems and seven of the 20 short stories published by Thomas in magazines since 1934. Ten stories in his next book, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog (1940), were based less on lavish fantasy than The Map of Love and more on real-life romances featuring himself in Wales. Sales of both books were poor, resulting in Thomas living on meagre fees from writing and reviewing. At this time <b>he</b> <b>borrowed</b> heavily from friends and acquaintances. Hounded by creditors, Thomas and his family left Laugharne in July 1940 and moved to the home of critic John Davenport in Marshfield, Gloucestershire. There Thomas collaborated with Davenport on the satire The Death of the King's Canary, though due to fears of libel the work was not published until 1976.|$|E
60|$|To {{the name}} of poet, as it implies the {{possession}} of an inventive faculty, Sir William Jones has but little pretension. <b>He</b> <b>borrows</b> much; and what he takes he seldom makes hotter. Yet some portion of sweetness and elegance must he allowed him.|$|R
