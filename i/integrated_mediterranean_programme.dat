40|$|The <b>Integrated</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Programmes</b> of 1986 - 92 and the Regional Development Programmes {{implemented}} via {{the three}} Community Support Frameworks (CSFs) {{of the period}} 1989 - 2006, consist the best evidence of real, on-the-ground objectives and strategies followed by Greek regional policy-makers over the last twenty years. The proposed paper shall focus {{on the evolution of}} priorities, goals and modes of intervention exhibited by the above programmes during a period of great changes inside and outside the Greek economy. It will analyse the change in the relative weight of sectors, regions and social groups that occurs through successive planning exercises. It will compare such change with developments in the E. U., the Balkans, and Community policy priorities. Given that all 13 NUTS II Greek regions have been eligible under Objective 1 of E. U. structural funding throughout the above period, a total of 39 regional programmes have been designed and implemented under the 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd CSF for Greece. All of them have undergone different types of external evaluation (ex-ante, mid-term and ex-post) but nobody, to my knowledge, has attempted to compose their findings and outline overall trends with respect to their strategic objectives. Moreover to compare expressed objectives, derived from programme documents, with actual priorities, emerging from the phase of implementation through the concentration of resources and the relative weight of interventions. To examine potential conflicts both between programmes and within programmes, such as the degree of internal programme consistency as far as the different levels of objectives are concerned. It is finally worth examining the relationship between regional programme objectives and national policy priorities as the latter are expressed in the sectoral programmes also included in the CSFs of the above period. To what extent the former support national policy priorities and to what extent the latter serve the overriding goal of a more balanced regional development? In a last brief section the paper will attempt to draw conclusions that can be considered a useful contribution to the new programming framework for the 2007 - 13 period currently under preparation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} crisis of 2008 is often {{taken to be}} a very special event when it comes to Greece. The Greeks are being blamed for their overconsumption and Greece is often described as one of the epicenters of the financial crisis. That Greece alone should be able to shake the global economy seems to be an exaggeration with the regard to Greece’s relatively small contribution to the European economy. The explanation for the Greek debt should be sought not only internally, but as a combination between the market based global system and the political constitution of Greece; modern Greece is born and developed in the EU and this has had a severe impact on the country’s economy and politic. The research question leading the search for another explanation is: What is the importance of EU's Regional Policies in the 1980 s, {{in order to understand the}} current economic situation in Greece? The regional politics influences and consequences in Greece is explored and analyzed through the theory of Historical Institutionalism, focused on institutionalized clientelism since the clientelistic structures both historically and today is said to have a major influence on the political culture in Greece. The analysis centers on how the policies implemented in Greece in the 1980 when entering the EU affected, and was affected by, institutionalized clientelism. To close in on an answer to these questions the history of Greece and the institutionalized clientelism in Greece, which led to the clientelism that played an important part in the political climate after the fall of the military dictatorship is explored. Furthermore, the political and economic reasons for Greece wanting to be part of the EU and EUs reasons for welcoming Greece is analyzed as a critical juncture for change and development of new path dependencies. The examples used to analyze this are <b>Integrated</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Programmes,</b> Single European Act and Common Agriculture Policies, all introduced and implemented in the 1980 ies. The last part of the analysis shows that these politics, that came from the weberian bureaucracy in EU, influenced how clientelism was institutionalized in Greece, hence how new path dependencies were created. The conclusions argues that the policies of from the EU was customized to the Greek clientelism, not the other way around. Hence policies created to a north west European understanding of s. 34 economics and bureaucracy failed in the Greek context and did not give the expected outcome. The immense debt of Greece can then be said to be a product of the regional politics of EU and the tradition of clientelism in Greece alike...|$|R
40|$|The Mediterranean {{together}} with the Black Sea constitutes a fishing ground of almost 3 000 000 square kilometres. In view of its geographical location, numerous conflicts arise in this area regarding its exploitation since 22 states have direct access to its waters.

The state of exploitation is such that the financial returns are extremely uneven, hence the requisite for profitability sometimes leaves much to be desired.

Political stability in the Middle East seems an illusion, particularly in Palestine. This paper compares three variables (religious, political and international interests) that, through a four-period partition (the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the millet system, the British Mandate, the partition plans and the constitutional forms proposed, and the system adopted afterwards), led Palestine to the present situation. With the creation of the Mandate in 1922, the primary task of the British Government was to find a convenient solution to lead Palestine to independence with a constitutional structure and later with a convenient partition between Arabs and Jews. An impossible task due to the conflicting interests of the two communities, of the other international actors and to the outbreak of the Second World War.

The paper argues that the envisioned “boomerang effect” of the transnational activities – the attempt to put pressure on Danish authorities through contacting political and religious authorities in the Middle East - backfired on Danish Muslims. This seems especially to be true for the actors involved in the so called “imam-delegations” – the delegations of preliminary religious authorities that travelled to Egypt, Lebanon and Syria in December 2005. These actors were forced into a more defensive mode of claims-making soon after their return to Denmark. Building on the case study of Danish Muslims’ transnational activities during the Muhammad caricatures controversy, the paper concludes by suggesting some theoretical modifications/specifications of the boomerang model of transnational activism, and by discussing briefly the more long term implications of what happened during the Danish controversy...|$|R

40|$|This special issue, an {{exercise}} in <b>integrated</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> history {{through the lens of}} diplomacy, demonstrates that diplomatic genres and practices associated with a European political and cultural tradition, on the one hand, or an Islamic tradition, on the other, were not produced in isolation but attained meaning through the process of mediation and negotiation among intermediaries of different confessional and social backgrounds. Building on the "new diplomatic history," the essays focus on non-elite (e. g. Christian slaves, renegades, Jewish doctors, Moriscos) and less commonly studied (mid- and high-ranking Muslim officials) intermediaries in Mediterranean cross-confessional diplomacy. The issue argues that the early modern period witnessed a relative balance of power among Muslim- and Christian-ruled polities: negotiations entailed not only principles of reciprocity, parity, and commensurability, but these were actually enforceable in practice. This challenges the notion of European diplomatic supremacy, prompting scholars to fundamentally rethink the narrative about the origins of early modern diplomacy...|$|R

40|$|Self-definition {{of ancient}} Greeks was created under the {{influence}} of socio-historical events, reflecting both, the relationship between Hellenes themselves and attitudes towards others. Greek wonder as a selfgenerated process yielded to a growing awareness that the drive towards advancement, observed in certain regions of Greece, was probably not possible without the external impetus of an extensively <b>integrated</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> world (Rollinger 2006, 197 - 226). The influencing factors for self-definition of ancient Greeks were a shared myth of descent, a shared territory, and a shared sense of history. Many scholars assume, that a sense of Greekness among Dorians, Ionians, Aiolians and others was finally crystallized throughout the number of military conflicts in which they were involved during the Classical period. Its seems probable that Athens played a major role both in the invention of the barbarian concept and in the substitution of cultural for ethnic criteria in the self-definition of Greeks. In their self-definition, Greeks seem to be deliberately stylized as antinomy to what they considered to be typical for others. Similarly, {{as a response to the}} strong pressure from the Persians, the national awareness of the Anatolians was formed.

40|$|This study aims to {{contribute}} to the discussion of late Byzantine urban centres by researching four important cities for which written, archaeological and numismatic sources are available, and by creating a profile for each. Conclusions drawn from the study of Monemvasia, Ioannina, Arta and Thessalonike have then been used to draw a wider picture about late Byzantine cities in general. The period 1204 - 1460 saw the territorial collapse of the Byzantine Empire, followed by its partial reconstitution and then final fall. The political fragmentation of the Balkans and an increasingly <b>integrated</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> economy placed the Byzantine city {{at the heart of the}} politics and the economy of its region, and connected it to the wider world more than at any time since the seventh century. The profile of cities such as Monemvasia, Ioannina, Arta and Thessalonike was shaped by their function both as centres of wealth and international trade, and the residence of the imperial administration and the provincial elite. The study is divided into four chapters, each dedicated to a particular city. Each chapter analyses the politics, built environment, society, population, privileges and economy of the individual urban unit, and combines each section to draw conclusions. The concluding chapter of the thesis highlights common trends and developments in the socio-economic profiles of the four cities, and makes more general observations about late Byzantine urban civilization.

40|$|<b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Programme</b> Series Ninth <b>Mediterranean</b> Research Meeting: Workshop 10 For {{the last}} two decades the human rights' {{discourse}} has been increasingly used across the world - one could argue that there has even been a globalization of human rights. This discourse has also, been intrinsically linked to positivism, enlightenment and secularism. It is with this in mind that this paper looks at how religious Muslim individuals and groups in France and Turkey have been appropriating human rights discourse and its national, regional and international legal channels to challenge state secular policies and redefine the relationship between religion and the state. I argue that because groups are framing their demands through a rights based discourse their plea becomes more powerful and legitimate, as they are using and re-appropriating elements of a global secular framework to challenge boundaries of Turkish and French state secularism. Moreover, the EU variable over the last decade has strengthened even more the value of human rights claims. By looking into two specific case studies - the work of the Collective Against Islamophobia in France and the Merve Kavakci case v. Turkey presented at the Strasbourg court of Human Rights, I attempt to analyze if groups are using this "authorized narrative" simply because it is the most effective way for them to assert their religiosity, or if they have found a space where they can propose a new plural ethos that can better co-exist with their piety - in other words, a space where they can redefine, and propose perhaps a more plural and de-centralize vision of secularism.

To prevent and reduce the consequences of forest fires, it is necessary to simulate and forecast the territory use and management, not only focused on forest areas, but also on all land uses and agricultural activities that may coexist there, considering the probability of fire occurrence. The objective of this paper is to present a methodological approach to address the integration of fire risk in <b>integrated</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> forest management models. The methodological approach considers simultaneously the climatic conditions through different times of the year (more or less favourable to forest fire damage) and structural conditions addressed to land uses, aspect, slope, roads and demographic density. The methodological approach was implemented in a management area located in the Algarve, in southern Portugal. The results for the Algarve region showed that the proposed approach is very useful for managers, since it allowed the calculation of fire susceptibility, vulnerability and fire damage, according to several climatic scenarios. It also allowed the incorporation of different paths regarding different fire risk conditions and the minimization of risk due to fire damage through different management responses...|$|R

From the 1930 ’s, Choubra al-Khyma, the northen suburb of Cairo, becomes rapidly an important industrial and labor stronghold, mostly based on the textile industry. An influential trade unionism arises to become a significant actor of the Egyptian politics shaped by the British colonial rule and an authoritarian monarchy. Enrooted in powerful nationalist and anti-colonial feelings, this trade unionist current promotes an autonomous path, refusing any political tutelage on the trade union movement from the political parties and non-worker figures. The General Union of Mechanical Textile Workers is the main strength of such a trend. It gains a significant influence in Choubra al-Khyma and expands its links with textile workers from other zones. Its leadership gradually shifts from a purely economic perspective to a peculiar form of political consciousness. Progressively, a radical network is set up, made of several textile workers (Mahmoud al ‘Askari, Taha Sa’d ‘Uthmân, …) plus a figure such as the trade unionist Youssef al-Medarek with the jewish marxist lawyer Youssef Darwich. He is himself involved in a secret marxist circle made up of three young jewish Egyptian intellectuals with Sâdeq Sa’d and Raymond Doueik. Progressively, this militant team is moving towards a kind of national labour Marxism. This network gets involved in different campaigns and activities : running the unions, editing its own paper Choubra, supporting a worker candidate for the 1945 parliamentary elections, campaigning to get an Egyptian delegate to the 1945 Paris founding conference of the world trade unions movement At the autumn 1945, a public initiative is launched : the Workers’ Committee for National Liberation (« lagna ‘ummâl lil-tahrîr al-qawmî »). Their campaign aims {{to pave the way for}} the setting up of a legal workers party. The impact is important in the country to the point that the Prime Minister, Mahmoud Fahmy Al-Naqrochi, decides to meet the key leaders. Our paper is a case study of such rich and experiment. This project expresses a specific and moving political consciousness : a labour militant network with a strong patriotic profile progressively evolves from a matrix made of nationalism, a strong worker consciousness, religiosity and a feeling for social justice towards a political progressive outlook influenced by marxism. We will firstly examine the general context and origins of such a project. Then, we will deal with its political agenda before dealing with its trajectory on the political scene at a time of huge social and nationalist upheavals. A part will discuss the political identity that was at stake. The last section will examine the tensions and finally the failure of such a rare experiment.

In order to explore these complex issues, the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies of the European University Institute held a conference on ‘The Gulf region: domestic dynamics and global-regional perspectives. Implications for the EU’ (Florence, Italy, 20 - 21 April 2015). This E-book captures the range and diversity of the vibrant intellectual debate that took place during the conference. Contributors to this volume analyse the changes and challenges affecting the Gulf monarchies: from the sustainability of their economic model to the security threats arising from the crises in Yemen, Iraq and Syria, from demography and immigration policies to the politicization of sectarian identities, from the international opportunities arising from the new role of GCC states to the confrontation with Iran. This volume offers a range of insights into one of the less known partners of the European Union and provides a valuable reference both for academics and policy-makers.

40|$|In this diploma thesis Union for the Mediterranean. From Sarkozy's {{ambition}} to European reality I follow an interesting case of one foreign policy. A presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy suggested within his pre-election campaign {{to set up}} Mediterranean with ambitious goals; when he became president he began to realize this initiative. I argue, that his motivation was not to primarily solve the regional issues or/and <b>integrate</b> the <b>Mediterranean</b> a little bit more, but through this activity to attract media attention. It corresponds {{to the theory of}} mediatization which states that politicians hold a permanent campaign; and to attract publicity they adapt to media as much as they can. Instead of following the political logic they follow media logic. Nicolas Sarkozy has usually done so in terms of national/domestic politics, however what I show is the fact that a foreign policy can also be lead by the permanent campaign - or to be more precise that politicians are trying to appeal on the national audience through the permanent campaign, and on public abroad through public diplomacy, it is practically the same thing. It can happen that politicians care more about the media and less about their own policies; this can be certain aspect observed on the case of the Mediterranean Union's project. It was one of the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|An {{earlier version}} of this paper was {{presented}} in Workshop 9 : ‘Changing Party Political Constellations and Public Policy Reform in Southern Europe’ at the Tenth Mediterranean Research Meeting, Florence & Montecatini Terme, 25 - 28 March 2009, organised by the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Programme</b> of the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies at the European University Institute. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the question of small and incremental reform in Turkish minority policies over the last two decades, contrasting with the dramatic economic, social, and political changes that the country has experienced over the same period. The main focus will be on two partly overlapping groups living in Turkey (Alevis and Kurds); comparison with other Southern European countries will be made as background reference. The reason for this focus is analytical: these two groups are structurally different from minorities found in Italy or Greece in that they are both large enough to carry great electoral weight and politically salient enough to affect Turkey's EU accession prospects. Minority policy is an often overlooked realm of public policy, either because it is considered too sensitive or too case-specific, as opposed to fiscal, labor, family, and immigration policy, which, at least in the European context, are now typically examined and compared by scholars on a more transnational framework. However, minority policy broadly defined (as the recognition and treatment of sections of the population identified as belonging to a special cultural heritage) touches upon a number of diverse policy areas including civil rights, education, regional development, relations between religion and state, language, culture, and national security. In Turkey minority policy in official discourse has historically been linked to the non-Muslim minorities protected by the Treaty of Lausanne, whereas Alevis and Kurds were traditionally accorded no special recognition under the Kemalist Republic. The first part of the paper attempts to theoretically situate minority policy in the context of competitive party politics. What is puzzling about Turkey is why given a climate of increased democratization and confidence after the suppression of the PKK insurgency, the Turkish party system has not been more responsive to the long-standing grievances of Kurds and Alevis. Partly based on existing literature, the author posits that a constellation of factors is necessary for policy reform on minority issues to proceed in a democratic system: the mobilization of the minority group(s) in question and either high external pressure on the state to satisfy minority demands or significant electoral competition for the minority's votes or participation in government of a party that monopolizes the minority vote and is ideologically committed to its agenda. The second part of the paper briefly discusses the history of state attitudes towards Kurds and Alevis in Turkey, as well as more recent developments including the reforms on Kurdish language rights, the abortive Çamuroğlu recommendations regarding Alevi pious foundations, DTP’s entry in parliament, and the constitutional amendment process launched by AKP. The third and final part of the paper explains why Turkey's party system for a long time lacked the necessary preconditions for more groundbreaking policy changes, underlining the importance of external pressure from the EU as an engine for reform.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} part of {{the overall}} United Nations Environment <b>Programme</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> work on the Implications of Future Climatic Changes for the Mediterranean Coastal Region. Most of this was published in Climatic Changes and the Mediterranean; Environmental and societal impacts of climatic change and sea level rise in the Mediterranean region, Vol 2, 1996. It compares the main findings, conclusions and recommendations of the regional and 11 site-specific studies in the Mediterranean, undertaken: a) to assess the likely implications of predicted climatic change on the natural and man-made environment and activities; b) to identify areas and systems most vulnerable to the expected change; and c) to suggest policies and measures that may avoid or reduce the negative impact of predicted change or adapt to such change. The evaluation of the methodology used in the preparation of site-specific studies is described and analysed in detail, and the impact of the studies on national, regional and local development policies and plans is assessed...|$|R
