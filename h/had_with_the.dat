5|$|After France {{requested}} U.S. {{assistance for}} its beleaguered force at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, Radford suggested an aggressive stance toward the Viet Minh, recommending the U.S. threaten them {{with nuclear weapons}} as it <b>had</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Chinese in Korea. He also advocated U.S. military intervention in the 1955 First Taiwan Strait Crisis {{as well as the}} 1956 Suez Crisis, but Eisenhower favored diplomatic approaches and threats of force.|$|E
5|$|Both {{versions}} of the game received mixed reviews according to the review aggregator site Metacritic. The main problems reviewers <b>had</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> game was its repetitiveness and the tediousness of some parts.

5|$|Another {{important}} source of studying ancient Tamil history are the coins {{that have been found}} in recent years in the excavations, megaliths, hoards and surface. The coins belonging to the Sangam age, found in Tamil Nadu are generally classified into three categories. The first category consists of punch-marked coins from Magadha (400 BCE–187 BCE) and the Satavahanas (200 BCE–200 CE). The second category is made up of coins from the Roman Empire dated from 31 BCE to 217 CE, coins of Phoenicians and Seleucids and coins from the Mediterranean region (c. 300 BCE). The third category of Sangam age Tamil coins are the punch-marked silver, copper and lead coins dated 200 BCE–200 CE and assigned to the Sangam age Tamil kings. The coins belonging to the first two categories mostly attest to the trading relationships that the Tamil people <b>had</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> kingdoms of northern India and the outside world. But they do not offer much information regarding the Sangam age Tamil polity. The third category of coins, however, have provided direct testimony to the existence of ancient Tamil kingdoms and have been used to establish their period to coincide with that of the Sangam literature.|$|E

The Xbox 360 version of the game received an overall rating of 54% from review aggregator Metacritic, while the PlayStation 3 version received a 58%. The iOS and Android version was given a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars by Touch Arcade.

5|$|Considering the {{lopsided}} {{score of}} the series, historians such as Paul Kitchen question why Dawson City was even granted a chance at the Cup. Dawson City had won no championships and {{did not belong to}} any recognized senior league. While team official Weldy Young knew Stanley Cup trustee P. D. Ross personally through their joint connection with the club, {{it may have been the}} political connections that Joe Boyle <b>had</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> government Interior Minister of the time, Clifford Sifton, that got Dawson City the series.|$|E
5|$|Fighters Uncaged is a {{fighting}} video {{game for the}} Xbox 360 Kinect system. It was developed by AMA Studios and published by Ubisoft in November 2010. Fighters Uncaged {{was one of the}} first twelve games released for the Kinect. The game has the player control Simon, a man who is attempting to win an illegal fighting tournament to help get his father out of trouble with a crime lord. It has one game mode and features many different fighting moves and different settings and opponents. Simon is able to go up in leagues by obtaining certain numbers of points, which in turn unlock more scenarios and opponents. Following its release, Zuffa filed a lawsuit against Ubisoft for the usage of a trademarked term. Fighters Uncaged received poor reviews from critics, with many criticizing the tutorial and visuals, and citing its motion control system as the biggest issue they <b>had</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> game, which many considered to be broken.|$|E

Three days later, Snow went to Vukovar and drove to Ovčara accompanied by Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sergeant Larry Moore who was deployed to the region with the UNPROFOR. At the site, Moore spotted a human skull in the mud. A few days later, the UN declared the site a crime scene and deployed Russian UNPROFOR troops to guard it.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{decides to}} take his family to the new sushi bar, The Happy Sumo. After {{sampling}} most of {{the items on the}} menu, he tries sushi made from fugu. The chef in charge is busy making love with Edna, so his apprentice has to slice the fish, of which certain parts are toxic. He tries to do it carefully, but Homer becomes impatient, only to have it served and become unsure if the poisonous portions have been removed. Homer considers it a treat, but the chef soon returns and believes that the fish has not been prepared correctly and tells Homer that he may have been poisoned. Homer and Marge go to the hospital, where Dr. Hibbert informs Homer that based on a chat he <b>had</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sushi chef, Homer is found out that he has increased likeliness of death and has 22 hours left to live.

5|$|In early {{editions of}} , many {{well-known}} legendary creatures were included {{such as the}} phoenix, dragon and manticore as well as cryptids like the satyrus, which Linnaeus collected into the catch-all category Paradoxa. Broberg thought Linnaeus was trying to offer a natural explanation and demystify the world of superstition. Linnaeus tried to debunk some of these creatures, as he <b>had</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hydra; regarding the purported remains of dragons, Linnaeus wrote that they were either derived from lizards or rays. For Homo troglodytes he asked the Swedish East India Company to search for one, {{but they did not}} find any signs of its existence. Homo lar has since been reclassified as Hylobates lar, the lar gibbon.|$|E

5|$|Khrimian {{was born}} in the Aygestan (Aikesdan) quarter of Van. His father, a weaver, died when Mkrtich was a child and he was brought up by his uncle, Khachatur, a merchant. The root of his last name, Khrim, is the Armenian {{language}} term for Crimea, suggests a link his family <b>had</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> peninsula. He received informal education at parochial schools of Lim and Ktuts islands in Lake Van and Varagavank, where he studied classical Armenian, history, and ecclesiastical literature. Upon returning to Van in 1842, he embarked on a journey across the region and made a pilgrimage to Etchmiadzin, the center of the Armenian Church. Khrimian wished to continue his education at a European university, but this desire was never realized. He lived in Constantinople from 1844 to 1846 where he made connections with Armenian intellectuals.|$|E
5|$|Main {{supporters}} of the bill were the LDP and the Komeito (CGP), while the opposition included the Social Democratic Party (SDPJ) and Communist Party (CPJ), who cited the connotations both symbols <b>had</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> war era.

Comparing 2008 life-to-date DS and DS Lite sales to the best-selling game console, Sony's PlayStation 2, showed potential in further expanding the Nintendo DS gaming population—particularly in Europe and the United States. To further promote the product line while expanding its gaming population, Nintendo created the DSi. Iwata has said that families often share DS and DS Lite consoles, so to encourage each family member to buy an individual handheld, Nintendo added personalization features to the DSi.|$|E
5|$|Still {{friends with}} Martello, Buczynski {{initiated}} him up till the third degree of the Welsh Traditionalist tradition, in return receiving third degree initiation into the Strega tradition. At the same time, {{he was facing}} problems within his own tradition as one couple running their own Welsh outer coven, Claudia and Gerard Nero, had decided to abandon Buczynski's tradition and receive initiation into Gardnerianism from the Kneitals; they had ultimately decided to do so after becoming increasingly sceptical of his historical claims to Palaeolithic roots. They took their initiates, including Margot Adler, with them, much to Buczynski and Slater's annoyance, leading to {{a breakdown of the}} friendship that they had <b>had</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Kneitals. His tradition nevertheless continued to grow and spread, and in January 1973, the tradition joined the Council of Earth Religions (COER), a pan-Pagan umbrella organisation founded the previous year to work for the common defence of the movement. His primary inner coven grew to a size that it had to divide into two at Midsummer 1973. His high priestess, Kay Smith, decided to take lead of one of them, while Eddie remained in the other, being joined by a new ritual consort named Judith. By August, there were two outer court covens of the Welsh tradition in New York City, and one each in Philadelphia and in Hopewell, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Syme {{argued that}} {{it was a mistake to}} regard it as a {{historical}} work at all and that no clear propaganda purpose could be determined. He theorized that the History is primarily a literary product – an exercise in satire produced by a 'rogue scholiast' catering to (and making fun of or parodying) the antiquarian tendencies of the Theodosian age, in which Suetonius and Marius Maximus were fashionable reading and Ammianus Marcellinus was producing sober history in the manner of Tacitus. (The History implausibly makes the Emperor Tacitus (275–276) a descendant and connoisseur of the historian). In fact in a passage on the Quadriga tyrannorum — the 'four-horse chariot of usurpers' said to have aspired to the purple in the reign of Probus — the History itself accuses Marius Maximus of being a producer of 'mythical history': homo omnium verbosissimus, qui et mythistoricis se voluminibis implicavit ('the most long-winded of men, who furthermore wrapped himself up in volumes of historical fiction'). The term mythistoricis occurs nowhere else in Latin. Of considerable significance in this regard is the opening section of the life of Aurelian, in which 'Flavius Vopiscus' records a supposed conversation he <b>had</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> City Prefect of Rome during the festival of Hilaria in which the Prefect urges him to write as he chooses and invent what he does not know.|$|E

5|$|The 49ers in the 1950s {{used the}} T formation, {{sometimes}} referred to as a full house backfield, which deployed a quarterback, fullback, and two halfbacks. Such a formation was common at the time at both the college and professional levels, as teams sought to emulate the success the Chicago Bears <b>had</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> formation over the previous decade. The Million Dollar Backfield began its construction in 1948 with the team's signing of speedy fullback Joe Perry. In 1951 the 49ers drafted quarterback Y. A. Tittle. Tittle had played the previous three seasons with the Baltimore Colts, and became available in that year's draft after the Colts folded. The next year the 49ers drafted halfback Hugh McElhenny in the first round. McElhenny proved to be an explosive play-maker and was recognized as the NFL's rookie of the year in 1952. All three were invited to play in the Pro Bowl for 1953, comprising the starting offensive backfield for the West. The final piece came in 1954, when John Henry Johnson joined the team. Johnson became known for his powerful running and his blocking, which served to compliment the finesse of Perry and McElhenny.|$|E
5|$|The {{focal point}} of the series, Alex was {{introduced}} as a recruit at the FBI Academy, Quantico, Virginia. Alex eventually became an FBI field agent and later the prime suspect for a terrorist attack on Grand Central Terminal. Despite clearing her name, she was fired from the Bureau and went on to join the CIA, where she was later named a fugitive for releasing classified U.S. intelligence to the public. The series focuses on her struggle to keep her country safe, while juggling her career and maintaining her on and off relationship with boyfriend Ryan Booth and her friendship with her best friend Shelby Wyatt. Originally conceived as a white character, Alex's characterization changed significantly following Chopra's casting, which came {{as a result of a}} talent holding deal ABC Studios <b>had</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> actress.

5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} by George Kamitani as first a sequel {{and then a}} spiritual successor to the 1997 Sega Saturn title Princess Crown. Development began in 2004 after the official formation of Vanillaware. The story was based around {{the concept of a}} Valkyrie princess. The scenario and world design incorporated Norse mythology, the works of William Shakespeare, fairy tales and early video games. 2D graphics were chosen over 3D graphics as Kamitani felt the style was stagnating, which necessitated presenting cutscenes as if on a stage rather than using traditional cinematography. Leifthrasir began development in 2013 as a means of addressing the issues both players and staff <b>had</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> original game while keeping the story intact. The music for both versions was composed by a team from Basiscape, led by company founder Hitoshi Sakimoto.|$|E
