The concert film premiered exclusively on ABC on November 25, 2010 as a 90-minute Thanksgiving special. A year before, over Thanksgiving itself, the network aired , {{shot at the}} Encore Theater, Las Vegas, on August 2, 2009. Several other trailers kept dropping on Beyoncé' official website in November. Beyoncé made an appearance at the School of Visual Arts Theater in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood on November 21, 2010 to premiere the concert film. On November 22, 2010, she held a screening of the DVD in New York, in presence of her parents and artists such as Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Hudson, Amel Larrieux, Tyson Beckford, Alicia Keys, and AJ Calloway. Additionally, {{in an interview with}} the Associated Press on the same day, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side, stating: [...] "I felt like I've done so many different things, it's time for me to show a bit of who I am. The hardest thing was showing that, because a lot of things that I filmed, I filmed in my computer, and I would never <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>so</b> open if someone else was in the room." [...] On November 23, 2010, Beyoncé was interviewed by Cynthia McFadden on ABC's Nightline where she stated [...] "I feel like I wanted the fans to be able to see the things that I see... It's a lot of things that I reveal about myself that I would never give to another director." ...|$|E

His apparent reason for becoming a ranger was that he thought Smokey Bear was talking directly to him in one of his famous public service announcements ("Only you can prevent forest fires"). He frequently breaks out in tears during Red's visits as he talks about how lonely he is and/or how much of a sacrifice he makes at his job. During one visit, Gord claimed to <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>so</b> lonely that he ate the watch tower and then later moved on to another tower in season 7. Gord sometimes laments his lack of recognition. Once, he thought that someone had left him some honorary medallions only to learn from Red that they were beer bottle caps (Gord thought that a Budweiser cap was for being a [...] "bud of the forest"). On another occasion, Gord justified his lack of communication with his superiors as a sign that he was doing a [...] "good job protecting the forest," [...] to which Red suggested that his superiors most likely forgot about him. In truth, it turned out that he had been dismissed many years ago, but the message had never reached him.|$|E

60|$|I {{think there}} is no {{complaint}} more just than what we find in almost every family, of the folly and ignorance, the fraud and knavery, the idleness and viciousness, the wasteful squandering temper of servants, who are, indeed, become one of the many public grievances of the kingdom; whereof, I believe, there are few masters that now hear me who are not convinced by their own experience. And I am not very confident, that more families, of all degrees, have been ruined by the corruptions of servants, than by all other causes put together. Neither is this to be wondered at, when we consider from what nurseries so many of them are received into our houses. The first is the tribe of wicked boys, wherewith most corners of this town are pestered, who haunt public doors. These, having been born of beggars, and bred to pilfer as soon as they can go or speak, as years come on, are employed in the lowest offices to get themselves bread, are practised in all manner of villainy, and when they are grown up, if they are not entertained in a gang of thieves, are forced to seek for a service. The other nursery is the barbarous and desert part of the country, from whence such lads come up hither to seek their fortunes, who are bred up from the dunghill in idleness, ignorance, lying, and thieving. From these two nurseries, I say, a great number of our servants come to us, sufficient to corrupt all the rest. Thus, the whole race of servants in this kingdom <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>so</b> ill a reputation, that some persons from England, come over hither into great stations, are said to have absolutely refused admitting any servant born among us into their families. Neither can they be justly blamed; for although it is not impossible to find an honest native fit for a good service, yet the inquiry is too troublesome, and the hazard too great for a stranger to attempt.|$|E

5000|$|The Student Council Treasurer and {{granddaughter of}} the principal. Like her position, she often thinks {{of how much}} {{something}} is going to cost, yelling at Yamata for kicking the metal door because overtime it could cause rust and have to be replaced which is expensive. She keeps track of the damage of what the gang causes and gives them a bill every time she runs into them. Saki is portrayed as being extremely weak and delicate, as she could not open a door Mitsuki could easily and just by trying injured her fingers, though Saya is jealous of her lack of strength because of all the attention Tadashi gives her from it. In a way she is displayed as Saya's opposite. Tadashi often bandages her which causes jealousy from Saya. Though if she gets angry enough, she displays a terrifying power and swears a lot, though she appears to be unaware of this. This scared even the Onigashirashu and Student Council {{to the point where they}} behaved for a whole week after the incident. She appears to be the only competent member of the Student Council, where the students will talk to her with issues rather than the President. Tadashi helps out Saki a lot because of her weak state and his helpfulness lead her to fall in love with Tadashi. This lead for her to cling and protect Tadashi which made many people believe they are dating. She first started to show feelings for Tadashi where she went to confront Saya (not knowing this was because of their date), speaking up to defend him, and going into a dazed state when she sees him. Her feelings for him <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>so</b> strong that she tries to prevent a situation where they are left alone together or where Tadashi would see her in more revealing clothes like a swimsuit. Later on, due to her growing feelings as well as Saya's posing as Angie, she too has disguised herself as a new member of the Hand Crafts club. Due to Tadashi helping her every time she asks and Kenji's words suggest that she is slowly getting fat, saying her legs make [...] "squishy sounds" [...] as well as her habit of adding chocolate to whatever she eats, calling it her life force. Because of the sudden interest in getting her legs thinner, she has a habit of believing people are pointing out that she has fat legs. When Saki gets emotional over the school's finances and breaks out into a grumble, she has a tendency to revert to her grandmother's native dialect. Both Hibari Imamoto and Mitsuki refer to her by the nickname Muchiko ("muchi" [...] means [...] "plump" [...] in Japanese and [...] "-ko" [...] is a common suffix attached to female given names).|$|E
40|$|We may {{be tempted}} to compare physicalist {{attempts}} to understand consciousness with 18 th century attempts to understand electricity. This may make us think that the former too though initially mysterious will ultimately be brought within the physicalist fold. But there’s a crucial disanalogy between the two: ‘What is consciousness?’ can be interpreted as two distinct questions: ‘What causes consciousness?’ And ‘what is it to be conscious?’ ‘What is electricity?’ can only be interpreted as ‘What causes electricity?’, ‘What is it to be electricity?’ being meaningless. Maybe physicalists <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>so</b> used to explaining phenomena where only the one question is applicable that they, I think erroneously dismiss those who entertain the other question. But the blame is not all one way. Those who entertain the ‘what is it to be conscious?’ question, think that because there is no physicalist answer to that question, therefore there must be a gap in the physicalist answer to the ‘what causes consciousness?’ question, a gap they try, like our friend here, to fill by postulating non-spatial things. Needless to say, these things don’t answer either question...|$|E

40|$|In this Essay, I {{assess the}} {{enactment}} {{and implications of}} the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress’s response to the 2008 financial crisis. To set the stage, I begin by very briefly reviewing {{the causes of the}} crisis. I then argue that the legislation has two very clear objectives. The first is to limit the risk of the shadow banking system by more carefully regulating the key instruments and institutions of contemporary finance. The second objective is to limit the damage in the event one of these giant institutions fails. While the new regulation of the instruments of contemporary finance—including clearing and exchange trading requirements for derivatives—is promising, its treatment of systemically important financial institutions is likely to create a troublesome partnership between these institutions and the government. I also argue that our financial world is just as prone to bailouts after Dodd-Frank as it was before, and that it would have made a lot more sense to focus on bankruptcy as the solution of choice for troubled financial institutions. After this initial assessment, I discuss the CEO compensation issues that <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>so</b> much attention in the press. I conclude by considering the legislation from a distinctively Christian perspective...|$|E

Like me, she is a critic of the way the law currently deals with these conflicts, fearing, as I do, that the legal culture tends to trivialize and denigrate religious devotion. So one might have thought we would have a lot in common. So did I, and I anticipated a fruitful discussion of our shared scholarly interest—until the conversation took a disturbing turn. My new acquaintance told me that she was familiar with two of my articles touching on religion and society. But only one of them, she told me, was clearly written by someone who is black. Had she known that I was black, she said, she would <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>so</b> much more out of the other one. Puzzled, I asked why this should be so. She seemed surprised at the question. It would, she said, have placed the argument in its proper perspective. This answer, however, only increased my bewilderment. Why, I asked, could she not simply take the argument as it was, evaluating it without regard to the color of my skin? Because, she explained patiently, she needed a context in which to evaluate the argument. Only then, she added gently, might we have a real conversation...|$|E
40|$|The area in {{and around}} Iraq is {{formerly}} known as Mesopotamia and is the birthplace of agriculture. The agriculture in south of Kurdistan, northern Iraq, is today being threatened by drought and depletion, and access to knowledge is limited in these regions. How can agriculture develop in the future without making too big impact on the environment? The main question was in what ways {{is it possible to}} use multifunctional plant species for increasing soil organic matter and improving soil structure in Kurdistan? Growing trees, shrubs and crops together and sometimes in combination with livestock is called agroforestry. Agroforestry can be divided in several systems where alley cropping was chosen due to its ability to be applied to farms of both small and big size. Trees and shrubs can be used to improve soil structure and increase soil organic matter. By pruning woody plants and add to the soil as litter or mulch it can increase the soil organic matter. Roots contribute with organic matter when penetrating the soil. Trees with a higher production of biomass should be chosen since they give a higher amount of litter that could be added to the soil. One thing that became clear was that no matter what species of trees were used, the soil organic matter increased when mulching. The outcome of these investigations showed that some of the keys to long-time fertility were to carefully select what species is the most suitable for the goal at the chosen site. In this case I found that Punica granatum and Carissa edulis was the best choice of lignified species at my site. These species were chosen mostly because of the adaption to the arid climate but also due to the difficulty to find other multifunctional species. Evergreen trees in arid areas use a lot of water, why species like Eucalyptus should be avoided in agroforestry systems. Hopefully this written thesis will be an inspiration for farmers that wish to sustain their soil fertility and increase biodiversity, and to do so in line with nature instead of depleting the soil. I wish my thesis will gain and inspirit the Kurdish people whom I <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>so</b> much inspiration and love from in return...|$|E
