40|$|Decision {{theory has}} been plagued {{with a variety of}} {{problems}} almost from the start. Some, like the Ellsberg paradox [Ellsberg, 1961] merely seem to point to the problems actual people have in calculating probabilities and utilities. Others, like the Newcomb paradox and its relatives, have motivated a re-foundation of decision theory on causal grounds rather than evidential grounds [Joyce, 1999]. Recent work of Harris Nover, Alan Hájek, and Mark Colyvan has revealed more problems with the way decision theory deals with the infinite, brought out in [Nover and Hájek, 2004] with the Pasadena Game- a variant of the St. Petersburg game that puzzled the 18 th century founders of decision theory, which has no expected value, rather than the infinite one of St. Petersburg. I believe that a different formalism may deal better with these infinities, and may suggest interesting new ways to think about the problems of causality and undefined probability that affect the others.

There is a pressing need to design fusion algorithms that combine data from heterogeneous sensors, {{with the goal of}} identifying welldefined Force Protection and Border Security threats.

Analogously, an Enterprise has both individual and collective behavior. Decisions that are made at the collective scale (e. g. force) rely on information that is obtained at the individual scale (e. g. unit); this information must be communicated effectively.

Supreme Court’s decision in Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues 2 ̆ 6 Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308 (2007) from a social psychological perspective. The field of social psychology has documented a pervasive phenomena, the Fundamental Attribution Error, the failure of decision makers to consider situational explanations, including the force of environments and social and situational norms on human conduct. In light of robust social psychological research on the Fundamental Attribution Error, legal concepts such as intent, intentionality, mens rea, and scienter should be reexamined and reconstructed. In Tellabs, the Supreme Court instructed federal courts to dismiss federal securities complaints, unless a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter to be cogent, and at least as compelling as any opposite inference one could draw from factual allegations in the complaint. The Courts of Appeals are divided, however, on whether this framework applies at summary judgment. When viewed from a social psychological perspective, Tellabs promotes effective judicial decision making. Tellabs broadens the epistemic <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> making to include consideration of both dispositional and situational factors. When federal courts explicitly consider alternative explanations and causes of the defendants’ actions, jurists {{are more likely to}} consider situational explanations and avoid the Fundamental Attribution Error, resulting in more accurate decisions.

40|$|Women {{diagnosed}} with early breast cancer are often distressed and confused {{about how to}} choose between surgical and medical treatments and frequently turn to health professionals for decision support and information. Unfortunately, there are few Australian studies currently published, which measure women’s distress level and decision satisfaction after choosing treatment for early breast cancer. This presentation will discuss {{the findings of a}} descriptive study investigating women’s (n= 104) distress level and decision satisfaction, three months following their initial surgery for early breast cancer. Data were collected using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI- 18, Derogatis 2000) and the Treatment Decision Satisfaction Questionnaire (TDSQ), Budden & Pierce 2002). The BSI- 18 questionnaire contains 18 items designed to serve as a screen for psychological distress in medical and community populations. The TDSQ contains 16 items (α= 0. 95) divided into two dimensions namely: 7 items measuring patients satisfaction with their decision process (α= 0. 91) and 9 items measuring their satisfaction with their decision outcome (α= 0. 95). Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Analyses indicated that 63. 5 % of women were identified as positive cases of experiencing somatization symptoms, 76. 9 % with depression, and 50 % with anxiety. For decision satisfaction, 71. 8 % of women agreed they were very satisfied with their decision-making experience and 83. 5 % agreed they were very satisfied with the treatment choice they made. This study provides information which {{can be used as a}} baseline to design assessment tools and evaluate future decision support aids given by health professionals. The ultimate <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> support interventions is to improve the psychological outcomes of women, by customising and bolstering their decision- making process, attempting to minimise their distress levels and post-decision regret, and increase their decision satisfaction when selecting treatment for early breast cancer...|$|E

40|$|Managers are {{increasingly}} faced with making complex decisions in turbulent organisational environments. This {{has led to}} greater information processing demands. Increasingly organisations {{try to deal with}} this {{in such a way that}} many of these decisions are now made in a group environment. The increase in group decision making has generated a corresponding intensification in the interest in options available to support such decision making. One such approach is a Group Decision Support System (GDSS) referred to as Decision Conferencing. However, Decision Conferencing rests on the unsupported key premise that the computer modeling, which forms an intrinsic part of the process, leads to shared understanding and commitment - the stated goals of the process. The application of Decision Conferencing to important organizational issues continues, yet prior to this study its fundamental premise was both empirically unsupported and potentially under-theorised. This theory-building research demonstrates that the interface between these concepts is more complex than the literature suggests and that the concepts themselves are problematic. Shared understanding is essentially a dependent variable, with factors such as comprehension of the modeling process impacting on the degree to which this is developed. In addition, many aspects of commitment fall outside of the domain of the Decision Conference workshop e. g. the individual’s sense of responsibility and degree of commitment to their profession. The idea of commitment appears to fall more into the arena of managerial responsibility and change management and it is partly how the outcomes are managed after the Decision Conference which will be crucial to their implementation. Within this study it appears that the most a Decision Conference can offer is the ‘buy-in’ or constructive involvement of the individual participant; the assurance of an unassailable case to which all participants have contributed, for the adoption of the outcomes; and the confidence in the outcomes that this brings. All of this suggests that a higher order goal which subsumes these factors should be considered when re-conceptualising the Decision Conferencing experience. It is suggested here that Decision Quality is a more appropriate goal for the Decision Conferencing process. In essence this is an expansion of the existing ‘best bet’ concept already endorsed in the Decision Conferencing literature. The thesis presents a number of conditions for assuring decision quality e. g. a democratic environment for decision making; mutual respect and an encouragement of diversity. It is also argued that it falls to the facilitator to encompass all of these factors. Given the above, it is also suggested that it is appropriate to consider an alternative conceptualization of Decision Conferencing which facilitators of public sector groups might adopt. This revised conceptualization is drawn from complexity theory. Incorporating the findings from this study a more strongly theorised facilitation approach, entitled Quality Facilitation Practice (QFP) has been developed. Taking into account all of the above a revised model for Decision Conferencing in the public sector is presented, incorporating both QFP and the higher order <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Decision</b> Quality...|$|E
40|$|This project {{addresses}} {{the need for}} a collaborative architecture for scientific modeling that allows various scientific models to easily interact. The need for such a system has been documented by recent studies such as the JFSP Smoke Roundtables and the JFSP review of tools done by the Software Engineering Institute. This project {{addresses the}}se needs by modifying the BlueSky Modeling Framework so that it can better serve as a collaborative architecture, and then utilizing this architecture to create an advanced application that could not otherwise be created. The BlueSky framework was modified for this purpose, and all changes integrated into all versions of BlueSky from 3. 1. 0 forward. BlueSky now contains a command line option that will automatically start it as a web-service provider, allowing it to be used by remote clients. When the web-service option is used, all models contained within BlueSky are automatically converted into web-service accessible modules, without need for a specialized web-service enabled version. Simple examples and documentation scripts designed to show a website or user interface creator how to access these models via web-service function calls were created. In addition, a more advanced website interface was created to show some of the advantages of web-service based scientific modeling. This tool, called BlueSky Playground, provides a single user interface into 10 models of fuels, consumption, emissions, plume rise, and smoke dispersion. A user can walk step-by-step through all of the model steps in the framework from fire information to smoke impact maps. At each step the user can choose the model they want to use and alter the modeled information before continuing on, allowing for a game-playing exploratory mode of interaction. Both the ability to access so many models through a single interface as well as the capability to obtain on-the-fly smoke dispersion calculations are novel to this tool. This application will be highlighted in 2010 through RX- 410 classes as a way for users to learn about the various component models. It will also serve as a training tool for managers needing to run multiple scenarios and understand the implications of various choices. The web-service oriented architecture utilized in the project offers many potential advantages to scientific research done with the <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> support. Separation of the scientific computing portion of such work from the user interface allows scientists to focus on creating the best models and web designers to focus on creating the best interfaces. Remote functioning of the models through the web means that local installation of the model is no longer required solving distribution issues, and allows an Internet user to run a model that requires resources not available to them locally (such as large datasets or fast processors). Modularity allows for “mash-ups” where models are combined in ways not originally foreseen to meet emerging needs, and provides choices to be made on exact modeling pathways at the user or institutional level...|$|E
