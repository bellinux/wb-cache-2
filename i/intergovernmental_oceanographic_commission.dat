2500|$|Revelle {{was deeply}} {{involved}} in the growth of oceanography in the United States and internationally after World War II. [...] Working for the Navy in the late 1940s, he helped to determine which projects gained funding, and he promoted the idea that the Navy ought to support [...] "basic research" [...] instead of only trying to build new technology. [...] At Scripps he launched several major long-range expeditions in the 1950s, including the MIDPAC, TRANSPAC (with Canada and Japan), EQUAPAC, and NORPAC, each traversing {{a different part of the}} Pacific Ocean. [...] He and other scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography helped the U.S. government to plan nuclear weapons tests, in the hope that oceanographers might make use of the data. [...] Revelle was one of the committee chairmen in the influential National Academy of Sciences studies of the biological effects of atomic radiation (BEAR), the results of which were published in 1956. [...] In 1952, along with Dr. Seibert Q. Duntley, he successfully moved the MIT Visibility Lab to SIO with financial support of the U.S. Navy. [...] Along with oceanographers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Revelle planned the American contributions to the oceanographic program of the International Geophysical Year (IGY). [...] He became the first president of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research, an international group of scientists devoted to advising on international projects, and he was a frequent advisor to the <b>Intergovernmental</b> <b>Oceanographic</b> <b>Commission,</b> created in 1960.|$|E

40|$|The European Commission {{strongly}} {{supports the}} development of GEOSS and of Blue Planet {{through a number of}} dedicated research projects and initiatives. GEOWOW (www. geowow. eu) is one such EU-funded research project, promoting Geo Interoperability across Weather, Ocean ecosystems, and Water run-off. GEOWOW has a strong connection with Blue Planet through one of its leading partners, the International <b>Oceanographic</b> <b>Commission</b> (IOC) that {{is also one of the}} key leaders of Blue Planet. GEOWOW supports the IOC in developing the information systems and tools, including cloud-based tools, necessary to make a global assessment of the oceans as part of the Trans-Water Assessment Programme.

40|$|Reading {{through this}} issue of Oceanography, it will become {{apparent}} that researchers in different disciplines see their seamounts in quite different ways. The term seamount has been defined many times (e. g., Menard, 1964; Schmidt and Schmincke, 2002; Pitcher et al., 2007; International Hydrographic Organization, 2008; Clark et al., 2010; Wessel et al., 2010) {{but there is no}} “generally accepted” definition. Instead, most definitions serve the particular needs of a discipline or a specific paper. Inconsistencies are common among different publications and, most notably, differ from the recommendations of the International Hydrographic Organization and International <b>Oceanographic</b> <b>Commission</b> (International Hydrographic Organization, 2008). It is not the goal of this note to arbitrate or remedy these inconsistencies. However, as seamount research begins to coalesce into one broad, multidisciplinary research community, it is important to: (1) have a simple definition that explains which features are included under the umbrella of seamount research and which are not, providing an essential condition for defining the seamount research community, and (2) respect and be aware of differences among disciplinary definitions, as they may {{stand in the way of}} consistently applying one disciplinary data set to another...|$|R
