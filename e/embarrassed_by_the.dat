5|$|The {{legality}} of this seizure was seriously disputed, but the British government {{had already been}} somewhat <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> activities of the Alabama, a ship also built by Laird Son & Co and operated as a commerce raider by the Confederate Navy. In order to overshadow discussions as to the {{legality of}} their action, the British government purchased the ships on 8 August 1864 for £25,000 {{in excess of the}} contract price.|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{exposed by}} Rolling Thunder was the unpreparedness of the Air Force for the {{operations}} it was undertaking. Its aircraft {{had been designed}} and its pilots trained for strategic operations against the Soviet Union – for nuclear, not conventional war. The new campaign exposed years of neglect in conventional tactics, while aircraft capabilities and armament were ill-suited to the task at hand. The Air Force was also <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that the Navy was better prepared. It possessed the only all-weather bomber in the U.S. inventory in the new A-6 Intruder and was also responsible {{for the development of}} the F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber, which became ubiquitous during the Vietnam War.|$|E

2500|$|According to Shay Hazkani, [...] "In {{the past}} two decades, {{following}} the powerful reverberations (concerning the cause of <b>the</b> Nakba) triggered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> publication of books written <b>by</b> those dubbed <b>the</b> “New Historians,” the Israeli archives revoked access {{to much of the}} explosive material. Archived Israeli documents that reported the expulsion of Palestinians, massacres or rapes perpetrated by Israeli soldiers, along with other events considered <b>embarrassing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> establishment, were reclassified as “top secret.” ...|$|R
5000|$|In December 1999, Amoruso {{issued a}} public apology after {{directing}} racist comments at Borussia Dortmund's Nigerian striker Victor Ikpeba. Earlier that day Amoruso's denied the allegations and threatened legal action {{in an interview}} to Corriere dello Sport (an Italian daily sports paper). The denials were described as [...] "vehement" [...] <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Daily Mail. He was later forced into a change of position, described as <b>embarrassing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Daily Mail and The Times, when TV footage contradicted his story. Subsequently, the BBC featured reports that Rangers supporters' racism had increased, in support of Amoruso.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Nixon {{told his}} family he planned to run for {{president}} a second time. Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life (for example, she had been <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> need to reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech), she was supportive of her husband's ambitions. Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of the Vietnam War, a Republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, U.S. President Warren G. Harding {{received}} {{her at the}} White House to present her with the 1 gram of radium collected in the United States. Before the meeting, recognising her growing fame abroad, and <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that she had}} no French official distinctions to wear in public, the French government offered her a Legion of Honour award, but she refused. In 1922 she became a fellow of the French Academy of Medicine. She also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Kennedy {{managed to}} amend the renewal of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 to include {{provisions}} for a national survey on nutrition. Stennis was so <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hearings that he proposed a $10 million emergency fund be established for food and medical services. Despite resistance from other Southern legislators {{and a lack of}} support from President Johnson, Stennis' bill passed. The Senate also voted unanimously to create a Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs. The Poverty Subcommittee held further field hearings across the country as part of its work.|$|E
50|$|In 1987, {{the investigative}} {{journalist}} Roger Cook filmed Sayers attempting to extort {{money from a}} reporter posing as a businessman. This was broadcast the following year as an episode of The Cook Report, and was considered extremely <b>embarrassing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> UDA, not least because it showed Sayers struggling with basic arithmetic. In {{the immediate aftermath of}} the broadcast the UDA announced that Sayers had been removed from his position, although in fact he remained as Brigadier in Mid-Ulster until he was arrested sometime later. He was tried at Belfast Crown Court in 1989, and sentenced to ten years in prison.|$|R
60|$|Siegmund {{stood on}} the hearth-rug with his hands behind him, swaying from one leg to the other. He was <b>embarrassed</b> always <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{presence}} of the amiable little woman; he could not feel at ease before strangers, in his capacity of accepted swain of Helena.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1974, Sinclair told The Globe and Mail {{that he was}} [...] "sick of hearing" [...] <b>the</b> {{recording}} and <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> some of <b>the</b> inaccuracies it contained, but that he would still write the same editorial over again.|$|R
5|$|Peggy and Al {{return home}} {{and show the}} tape to Steve and Marcy, who are <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> film, much {{to the delight of}} the Bundys. The Rhoades express their dismay that they were {{secretly}} recorded, but Steve points out that the Bundys may have been videotaped as well. Marcy and Al are upset by this violation of their privacy and propose physical violence against the owners of the motel. Steve and Peg, on the other hand, want to take action against the Hop-On-Inn and make money from the incident.|$|E
5|$|Although {{produced}} by Universal Pictures, The Brute Man was distributed by Producers Releasing Corporation, {{one of the}} smaller film studios from Hollywood's Poverty Row. In 1945, Universal merged with the company International Pictures, and the new organization adopted a policy against developing any more B movies, including Westerns, horror films, serials and movies running 70minutes or less. This resulted in the firing of numerous production personnel members and the sale of several already-developed films, including The Brute Man. The sale was also perpetuated in part by the death of star Rondo Hatton. He {{died as a result of}} his acromegaly on February2, 1946, about eight months before The Brute Man was first screened, making it his final film. Universal feared releasing the film so soon after his death would lead to accusations that the studio was exploiting the illness that ultimately killed Hatton. Now <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> film, the studio was anxious to sell it.|$|E
5|$|Historian Tim Newark unraveled {{the myth}} {{in his book}} Mafia Allies. A version that is {{probably}} {{closer to the truth}} is that Vizzini simply led a delegation of locals to meet an Allied patrol whose commander had asked to speak to whoever was in charge. He quotes local historian, Luigi Lumia, who described how a procession of people with Calogero Vizzini at the helm made its way towards the tanks chanting: 'Long Live America', 'Long Live the Mafia', 'Long Live Don Calo'. Vizzini was taken to a command post outside Villalba and was interrogated about a recent firefight involving an American jeep on patrol. When Vizzini {{made it clear that the}} Italian soldiers had fled and the firefight had been caused by exploding ammunition, the frustrated US army official took his rage out in a stream of obscenities. Vizzini was utterly <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> incident and ordered his interpreter not to tell anybody what had happened.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, at Whole Foods Market, Randy is {{pressured}} by a cashier to give additional money for poor starving children while paying for groceries.

60|$|She flung {{her arms}} passionately round his neck. He was <b>embarrassed</b> {{sometimes}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> demonstrations of her affection. He {{would have preferred}} her to be more passive. It shocked him a little that she should give him so marked a lead: it did not tally altogether with his prepossessions about the modesty of the feminine temperament.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s skateboarding was destitute, {{viewed as an}} <b>embarrassing</b> fad <b>by</b> non-participants. <b>The</b> Canadian contest circuit dried up and Harris often drove over 24 hours to California just to remain {{involved}} in competitions.|$|R
5|$|In British Guiana, {{the leftist}} People's Progressive Party (PPP) {{candidate}} Cheddi Jagan won {{the position of}} chief minister in a colonially administered election in 1953, but was quickly forced to resign from power after Britain's suspension of the still-dependent nation's constitution. <b>Embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> landslide electoral victory of Jagan's allegedly Marxist party, the British imprisoned the PPP's leadership and maneuvered the organization into a divisive rupture in 1955, engineering a split between Jagan and his PPP colleagues. Jagan again won the colonial elections in 1957 and 1961; despite Britain's shift to a reconsideration of its view of the left-wing Jagan as a Soviet-style communist at this time, the United States pressured the British to withhold Guyana's independence until an alternative to Jagan could be identified, supported, and brought into office.|$|E
5|$|Closer to home, McKinley and Hay {{engaged in}} {{negotiations}} with Britain over the possible construction of a canal across Central America. The Clayton–Bulwer Treaty, which the two nations signed in 1850, prohibited either from establishing exclusive control over a canal there. The war had exposed the difficulty of maintaining a two-ocean navy without a connection closer than Cape Horn. Now, with American business and military interests even more involved in Asia, a canal seemed more essential than ever, and McKinley pressed for a renegotiation of the treaty. Hay and the British ambassador, Julian Pauncefote, agreed that the United States could control a future canal, provided that it was open to all shipping and not fortified. McKinley was satisfied with the terms, but the Senate rejected them, demanding that the United States be allowed to fortify the canal. Hay was <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rebuff and offered his resignation, but McKinley refused it and ordered him to continue negotiations to achieve the Senate's demands. He was successful, and a new treaty was drafted and approved, but not before McKinley's assassination in 1901.|$|E
5|$|Ellet and Stephens {{continued}} {{writing to}} Griswold's ex-wife, urging {{her to have}} the divorce repealed. Myers was finally convinced and filed in Philadelphia on September 23, 1853. The court, however, had lost records of the divorce and had to delay the appeal. Adding to Griswold's troubles, that fall, a gas leak in his home caused an explosion and a fire. He was severely burned, losing his eyelashes, eyebrows, and seven of his finger nails. That same year, his 15-year-old daughter, Emily, nearly died in Connecticut. A train she was riding on had fallen off a drawbridge into a river. When Griswold arrived he saw 49corpses in a makeshift morgue. Emily had been pronounced dead when pinned underwater but a doctor was able to revive her. On February 24, 1856, the divorce appeal went to court, with Ellet and Stephens providing lengthy testimony against Griswold's character. Neither Griswold nor Myers attended and the appeal was dismissed. <b>Embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ordeal, McCrillis left Griswold in New York and moved in with family in Bangor, Maine.|$|E
5000|$|The robbers on {{the night}} of Jan. 17th, 1950 make off with {{more than a million dollars}} in cash, along with another million-plus in {{securities}} and checks. Brink's, a company that prides itself in the safekeeping of money, is nationally <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> what <b>the</b> press is calling [...] "the crime of the century." [...] Even FBI director J. Edgar Hoover (Sheldon Leonard) takes a personal interest in finding the culprits, even so much as creating a makeshift FBI office in Boston.|$|R
25|$|He got {{his first}} call to the South African Test team in 2010 when England were touring, but {{it was due to}} an <b>embarrassing</b> error <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{selection}} committee.

5|$|Podgorny's {{life after}} his {{resignation}} {{is not well}} documented. The last mention of him in any major Soviet media was his meeting with Urho Kekkonen, the President of Finland. There was never any explanation given, nor a denunciation of him, by the Soviet authorities. Podgorny retained his seat in the Supreme Soviet after his downfall. He was seen at the 61st anniversary reception of the October Revolution at the Grand Palace of the Kremlin in November 1978 by Tokichiro Uomoto, the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Podgorny spoke to Brezhnev, Kosygin, and then to Andrei Gromyko, all of whom looked <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of Podgorny, according to Uomoto. Soon after this incident, Podgorny lost his seat in the Supreme Soviet. In Tretyakov Gallery, Podgorny {{was removed from the}} 1977 painting of the Soviet leaders at the Red Square by Dmitriy Nalbandyan in which Podgorny stood between Brezhnev and Kosygin. Podgorny died of cancer on 12 January 1983, and was buried in Moscow at the Novodevichy cemetery.|$|E
5|$|<b>Embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{events at}} the press conference, Đính {{returned}} to the officers' mess at the Joint General Staff headquarters. His colleagues, led by General Trần Văn Đôn, were plotting a coup against Diệm because of the Buddhist crisis, and attempted to play on Đính's ego to convince him to join them. They knew that without Đính's assistance, a coup would be difficult as his forces dominated the region surrounding the capital. In a series of meetings, the other generals assured Đính {{that he was a}} national hero worthy of political authority, and claimed that Nhu had not realised how important he was in the future of the country. Đính's colleagues even bribed his soothsayer to predict his elevation to political power. The other generals told him that the people were dissatisfied with Diệm's cabinet and that Vietnam needed dynamic young officers in politics, and that their presence would reverse the declining morale in the ARVN. They advised Đính to ask Diệm to promote him to interior minister, Dương Văn Minh to defence minister, and Trần Văn Minh to education minister. The other generals hoped that would reject Đính and wound his pride. As a result, Đính and his fellow generals met Diệm at the palace, where Đính asked the president to promote him to the post of interior minister. Diệm bluntly chastised Đính in front of his colleagues, and ordered him out of Saigon to the central highlands resort town of Đà Lạt to rest. Đính felt humiliated and embarrassed, having promised his colleagues that he would be successful. The Ngô brothers had been alarmed by Đính's request, and put him under surveillance. Đính found out, further straining his relationship with the palace. Đính agreed to join the coup, although with his ambitious nature, the other officers were skeptical and planned to have him assassinated if he tried to switch sides.|$|E
5|$|The Free State {{was happy}} to take over Abir's {{concession}} as the State had built up sufficient income {{to be able to}} afford to run tax collections by itself. In addition the Free State was <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> continuing allegations of atrocities caused by Abir and it could institute reforms more effectively if it were in control. Leopold authorised the takeover in the hope that the Free State would be able to resume rubber collection and exports and on 12 September 1906 an agreement was signed which stated that all profits from the concession would go to the Free State in return for payment to Abir of 4.5 fr per kilogram of rubber harvested until 1952. Leopold told Abir's shareholders that he expected exports to return to normal levels within two years. To restore control the Free State dispatched a force of 650 men and 12 European officers under the command of Inspector Gerard to the concession. They returned four months later, leaving some areas still rebellious and with news that there were almost no rubber plants left. As a result, the quotas expected per man were cut to just 6kg of rubber per year, with some struggling to find even that much. State income was therefore negligible whilst the costs of controlling the concession continued to increase. Throughout this time Abir was still making a profit by taking its share of the rubber exported for almost no expenditure.|$|E
25|$|For months, Allende {{had feared}} calling upon the Carabineros ("Carabineers", the {{national}} police force), suspecting them of disloyalty to his government. On 9 August, President Allende appointed General Carlos Prats as Minister of Defence. On 24 August 1973, General Prats {{was forced to resign}} both as defense minister and as the commander-in-chief of <b>the</b> army, <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> both <b>the</b> Alejandrina Cox incident and a public protest {{in front of his house}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wives of his generals.

50|$|When a {{party is}} suggested, the trio {{remember}} the disaster that occurred when three of Jane's friends arrived for a visit. Jane had organized an English-style picnic for her friends, but Tarzan {{had refused to}} join them after believing Jane was <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> him. <b>The</b> picnic was interrupted when two panthers, Nuru and Sheeta attacked Jane and her friends, forcing them to flee into the deeper regions of the jungle. As Jane taught her friends a few survival techniques, they were once again ambushed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> panthers, only to be saved when Tarzan rushed in.|$|R
5000|$|During {{his work}} with Cassavetes, Harwood claimed that the {{notoriously}} unpredictable director preferred to use the [...] "scratch track" [...] version of his compositions, rather than to let Harwood refine and re-record them with an orchestra. Some of these scratch tracks were recorded in Cassavetes office, with piano or guitar, as demos, and then eventually {{ended up in the}} final film. Though Harwood was sometimes surprised and <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> this, <b>the</b> technique matched the raw, unpolished feel that marks most aspects of Cassavetes' films.|$|R
25|$|In a Charlie Rose {{interview}} in 2000, Cartier-Bresson {{noted that it}} wasn't necessarily that he hated to be photographed, but {{it was that he}} was <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> notion of being photographed for being famous.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan {{notes that}} Isaac evidently {{did not believe}} her, since Isaac quotes the Zohar as {{authored}} by Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai in a manuscript in Rabbi Kaplan's possession. This leads him to hypothesize that Moses de León's wife sold the original manuscript, as parchment was very valuable, and was <b>embarrassed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> realization of its high ancient worth, leading her to claim {{it was written by}} her husband. Rabbi Kaplan concludes saying this was the probable series of events.|$|E
25|$|Griffin {{started as}} a singer on radio at age 19, {{appearing}} on San Francisco Sketchbook, a nationally syndicated program based at KFRC. Griffin was overweight as an adolescent and a young man, which disappointed some radio fans when they saw him in person.
