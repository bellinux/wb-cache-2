30|$|A study {{about the}} geomorphic set up of an area, {{particularly}} a reclaimed and amalgamated island like Mumbai {{which has become}} the hub for all the developmental activities, has paramount importance as {{the majority of the}} population depends upon groundwater. The study aims at delineating the different geomorphic landforms on the basis of its hydrogeomorphic characteristics. These delineated landforms are further characterized by their <b>hydrogeochemistry</b> and subsurface geology. A number of studies on the <b>hydrogeochemistry</b> of Mumbai have been conducted (cf.

Recently, Egbunike (2018) assessed the water types and suitability of groundwater resources in Umunya area for drinking purpose using limited approach. Nevertheless, the literatures reporting on the <b>hydrogeochemistry</b> and quality of water resources in Umunya district are very scarce.

Moreover, this study also examines the various natural and anthropogenic factors that affect the <b>hydrogeochemistry,</b> quality and suitability of the water resources. The methods integrated to achieve the aim of this work included geochemical investigations, stoichiometry, WQI, multivariate statistical analyses (correlation matrix analysis and principal component analysis) and health risk analysis.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are (1) to parallelize a 3 -dimensional <b>hydrogeochemistry</b> code and (2) to apply the parallel code to a proposed waste disposal site at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The 2 -dimensional <b>hydrogeochemistry</b> code HYDROGEOCHEM, developed at the Pennsylvania State University for coupled subsurface solute transport and chemical equilibrium processes, was first modified to accommodate 3 -dimensional problem domains. A bi-conjugate gradient stabilized linear matrix solver was then incorporated to solve the matrix equation. We chose to parallelize the 3 -dimensional code on the Intel Paragons at ORNL by using an HPF (high performance FORTRAN) compiler developed at PGI. The data- and task-parallel algorithms available in the HPF compiler proved to be highly efficient for the geochemistry calculation. This calculation can be easily implemented in HPF formats and is perfectly parallel because the chemical speciation on one finite-element node is virtually independent of those on the others. The parallel code was applied to a subwatershed of the Melton Branch at ORNL. Chemical heterogeneity, in addition to physical heterogeneities of the geological formations, has been identified as one of the major factors that affect the fate and transport of contaminants at ORNL. This study demonstrated an application of the 3 -dimensional <b>hydrogeochemistry</b> code on the Melton Branch site.

30|$|High {{salinity}} {{has been}} reported {{to be one of the}} major constrains for tailing revegetation in many tailing impoundments [6], especially in Queensland [30, 31]. Thus, knowledge on the dynamics of salinity in tailings is of primary importance for tailing revegetation. For the pure tailings, salts can be leached to a level of normal soil salinity after two cycles of leaching (1, 400 ml, approximately 20 pore volumes), and salt recovery was negligible after prolonged weathering. The high EC at the beginning of leaching and its low resilience thereafter basically implied that the EHM tailings had ever experienced a highly reactive stage, which accumulated salts, and now are tending to be temperate in geochemical reactivity. This is in agreement with the results from the long-term on-site monitoring of EHM <b>hydrogeochemistry</b> [6], and quite different from the pattern of hydrogeochemical stability of some coal mine tailings which had a high and rapid resilience of salinity even after 60 -pore-volume leaching [32]. Quasi-stable <b>hydrogeochemistry</b> is a good sign for tailing revegetation as surface layer is the essential zone for plants' root development.|$|E

Geochemical nature of confined aquifer was earth alkaline with increased portion of alkalis with prevailing bicarbonate, followed by chloroalkaline disequilibrium type of ionexchange process.

An interesting finding is that woodchip amendment, though beneficial for tailing revegetation by increasing labile C and microbial biomass, may have the potential to accelerate the weathering of tailings' reactive minerals, acidifying the pore water and increasing the release of saline ions and toxic elements.|$|E
30|$|The {{classification}} of landforms {{on the basis}} of hydrogeomorphic characteristics is further validated with the <b>hydrogeochemistry</b> and subsurface geology. Both the studies validate the hydrogeomorphic {{classification of}} landforms studied through field work and remote sensing techniques. The <b>hydrogeochemistry</b> of denudational landforms reveals that the quality of water is good, but replenishment during monsoon is very small. Hence, these landforms have to be preserved from deterioration and are ideal target for artificial recharge for a better tomorrow in Mumbai Island. Continuous contour trenches (CCT), loose boulder structures (gully plugs) are the most suitable structures for hilly area as these structures will function initially as soil conservation structure and subsequently improve the soil moisture retention and also enhance the recharge to groundwater. These structures will also improve sustainability of springs thereby improving water supply scenario in the small hamlets situated in hilly areas. But fluvial landforms have good potential to hold water and the quality of water is usually good. This landform is the feeder for domestic supply of water to {{the majority of the population}} in the city and has to be protected from deterioration. Marine landforms have good storativity, but are frequently invaded by seawater.|$|E

In order to accomplish these, groundwater sampling from 30 shallow and deep wells in the plain were carried out in July 2012. The water samples were analyzed for various physicochemical parameters such as pH, EC, Na+, Ca 2 +, K+, Mg 2 +, Cl−, CO 3 2 −, HCO 3 −, SO 4 2 − and NO 3 −. Chadha’s diagram demonstrates {{that most of the}} groundwaters belonged to the Na–Cl and mixed Ca–Mg–Cl hydrochemical facies. The concentrations of some major ions in groundwater are above the permissible limit for drinking and domestic purposes except for a few locations. The results of saturation index computation show that dissolution of gypsum, anhydrite, halite and silicate minerals occurs frequently across the study area, whereas the groundwater is supersaturated with regard to calcite and dolomite. Cross-plots show that weathering and dissolution of different rocks and minerals, ion exchange, reverse ion exchange and anthropogenic activities, especially agricultural activities, are effective in <b>hydrogeochemistry</b> of the study area.|$|E
