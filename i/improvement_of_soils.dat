Buckwheat consumes and bears {{a great many}} of nutrients that affords to classify it as a crop rather demanding to conditions of soil fertility. Most high yields of buckwheat can be obtained on fertile, affluent an organic substance and available forms of elements of mineral nutrition, the soils having neutral reaction or close to it. For forming one centner of grain and the conforming amount of straw it is necessary 4 - 5 kg of nitrogen, 2. 7 - 3. 1 kg ofphosphorus and 5 - 6. 5 kg ofpotassium (1, 7). As farmers admits, the further intensification and efficiency of agriculture most of all is connected to system engineering, which take into account individuality of soil- climatic conditions in limits not only a natural- economic zone (region or microzone), but also each field. Thus special topical character is obtained with the schema of interaction of systems of agriculture and fertilizers with conditions and resources ofnatural habitat, agrobiology of crops and their varieties. Recently in agriculture appeared a new trend of biologization and applications of non conventional organic fertilizers (non commodity part of yield- straw) and biofertilizers (4. 7 - 10). But these researches were carried out mainly for other agricultural crops and there is a little information on utilization of fertilizers for buckwheat.

40|$|Abstract. The use of {{recycled}} materials is nowadays greatly promoted and exploited in many industries, including construction and civil engineering. It is advantageous and efficient to utilize mainly those materials that cannot find {{their use in}} any other application. The steel wires from old automobile tires are a perfect example – {{they can be used}} as dispersed reinforcement for subsoil stabilization in railway engineering. In order to test the structural performance of the recycled wires as reinforcement of brittle matrix, gypsum was chosen to be the model matrix material. Such approach resulted in a relatively cheap gypsum-based composite, effectively combining gypsum as the material able to resist high levels of compression and the wire reinforcement from old automobile tires, which is able to transfer tensile stresses. The tested material was removed from molds after less than 20 minutes of hardening and immediately loaded. The paper presents the results of the compression test carried out on three different specifications – the reference sample was composed of a pure gypsum matrix, while the other two were reinforced by poorly and perfectly compacted dispersed wire reinforcement. The results indicate the huge potential of the recycled tire wires for the <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils</b> and brittle materials...|$|E
30|$|Generally, most {{agricultural}} soils of Iran have low content {{of organic matter}} (OM) and suffer from poor physical conditions (Havaee et al. 2014). On the other hand, daily production of large quantities of solid organic wastes causes serious disposal problems, environmental pollution, and possible health risks. Using a good strategy such as composting process, solid wastes can be converted into useful products for <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils</b> properties (Hashemimajd et al. 2004; Sohrabi Yourtchi et al. 2013). Soil disposal of municipal waste compost (MWC) is an attractive practical procedure reducing the waste disposal problems in large cities. Compost {{can be considered as}} a valuable source of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), essential trace elements, and OM that well improves soil physical properties and plant nutritional status (Bertoldi et al. 1996; Zinati et al. 2004; Kabirinejad and Hoodaji 2012). The two major drawbacks encountered from application of compost to soils are the accumulation of an excess amount of soluble salts in treated soils and the potential toxicity of certain trace elements to plants (Maftoun et al. 2004). Trace amounts of some elements such as copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) are essential micronutrients for plants, animals and microorganisms, but when applied in excessive amounts they may depress plant growth and reduce the quality of food materials (Petruzzelli 1996).|$|E

40|$|Cement {{deep soil}} mixing {{is one of}} the most widely used ground {{improvement}} techniques to enhance the strength of weak soils for construction purpose. One of the engineering parameter that influences the strength performance of the improved soil is plasticity. This paper investigates the effect of cement and inclusion of waste materials on the plasticity of deep mixing improved soils. Two waste materials namely, Pulverised Fuel Ash (PFA) and Ground Granulated Blast Slag (GGBS) were considered. The investigation was carried out on five different soil samples with natural plasticity of 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 37 % and 45 %. In the first phase of improvement, samples were mixed with 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 % cement (CEM I) content by weight of dry soil. In the second phase, the cement contents were reduced by 50 % and replaced with PFA. In the third phase, cement was further reduced by 33. 3 % and replaced with equal amounts of PFA and GGBS. All improved samples were cured under 100 % relative humidity and subjected to liquid and plastic limit test after 3 days. Analysis of results showed that for cement improved soils, increase in cement content beyond 15 % by weight of dry soil increases plasticity index of improved soils. The inclusion of PFA and GGBS to cement during deep soil mixing reduces the plasticity index of the improved soil and may enhance the strength gain over time. PFA and GGBS could be used in deep soil mixing with reduced amount of cement and thus reducing cost, CO 2 emission and the environmental impact of cement deep soil mixing. The results have shown that 15 % cement is the optimum amount of cement required for deep mixing <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils</b> with natural plasticity index of 5 - 45 %. The inclusion of GGBS and PFA in the blended soil reduces the amount of cement required for optimum binder content and resulted to 20 % Cement/GGBS/PFA optimum binder content in the ratio of 1 : 1 : 1. This study has shown that addition of 15 % cement content and 20 % Cement/GGBS/PFA resulted to improved soils with plasticity index less than 17 % making the investigated soils suitable for use as embankments and pavement for light to medium traffic. It could also be added that soil-binder interaction depends on soil type and the extent of improvement in plasticity index depends on plasticity index of the natural soil. A generalised flow chart based approach as a function of plasticity index of the natural soil have been developed for selection of binder for use in construction where increase in strength is envisaged...|$|E

30|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{the use of}} biochar as a soil {{amendment}} and tool for C sequestration has a good potential in increasing crop productivity. Biochar is a carbonaceous material produced by pyrolysis of biomass in a limited oxygen condition (Schahczenski 2010). Numerous studies showed that adding biochar into infertile soils can potentially increase the cation exchange capacity <b>of</b> the <b>soil</b> and nutrient sorption (Jien and Wang 2013; Gray et al. 2014); stimulate soil microorganisms activities (Ducey et al. 2013), and reduce plant nutrients leaching losses from the soil (Kameyama et al. 2012). Moreover, several studies have highlighted {{the positive effects of}} biochar on root growth (Ogawa and Okimori 2010; Prendergast-Miller et al. 2014), particularly increased root biomass (Xiao et al. 2016) and root length (Solaiman et al. 2012; Olmo et al. 2016). There is also increasing interest in the combination of biochar with compost for <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> quality other than C sequestration. The synergistic effects of biochar-compost combination theoretically could be achieved through the stability of biochar which promotes C sequestration, apart from <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> properties and source of plant available nutrients as compost mineralises and eventually adds to the organic matter pool (Kammann et al. 2016).|$|R
