There is also evidence of a cut and <b>folded</b> <b>paper</b> <b>box</b> from 1440. It is possible that paperfolding in the west originated with the Moors much earlier; however, it is not known if it was independently discovered or knowledge of origami came along the silk route.|$|R

5000|$|In the mid-to-late-19th century, the Town of Milton was {{the site}} of {{numerous}} manufacturing concerns. The most famous was the paper mills of [...] "Paper Bag King" [...] George West, who invented a line of square-bottomed paper bags and sold them by the millions soon after the American Civil War. There were also the celebrated hard edge tool factories of Isaiah Blood, the large planing, sash, and door mill of Benjamin Barber, the National <b>Folding</b> <b>Box</b> <b>paper</b> mill, and the Cottrell Paper Mill, the only manufacturer that still operates today. All of these mills were water-powered, and therefore succumbed to competition from electric-powered factories in the early 20th century.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{creation}} of context-specific environments designed to assist people engaged in productive tasks. These Active Workspaces are an emerging class of applications that combine interaction design, innovative input and output techniques and multi-media coaching methodologies to teach people to create things in the physical domain. The design and implementation of two systems that exemplify the features, process and goals of Active Workspace design are detailed and evaluated. CounterActive is an interactive kitchen counter that guides users of varying age and skill level through the preparation of several recipes. CounterActive enlivens the experience of cooking with instructional videos, illustrative photos, entertaining music and sounds. Origami Desk is an exhibit that teaches people how to <b>fold</b> <b>paper</b> into beautiful <b>boxes</b> and cranes. The desk not only projects animations and videos for the user to mimic, but also monitors the <b>folding</b> of the <b>paper</b> to enable performance feedback. These project descriptions are accompanied by generalized principles {{for the design of}} Active Workspaces, process guidelines, and as well as analysis of relevant technologies and ruminations on possible future applications in this arena. by Wendy Guang-wen Ju.
