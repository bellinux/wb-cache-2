25|$|Outcomes have {{generally}} indicated that early onset of puberty in <b>girls</b> <b>can</b> be psychologically damaging. The {{main reason for}} this detrimental effect {{is the issue of}} body image. As they physically develop, gaining weight in several areas of the body, early-maturing girls usually look larger than girls who have not yet entered puberty. A result of the social pressure to be thin, the early-maturing girls develop a negative view of their body image. In addition, boys may tease the girls about their visible breasts, forcing the early-maturing girl to hide her breasts by dressing differently. Embarrassment about a more developed body may also result in the refusal to undress for gym. These experiences lead to lower self-esteem, more depression and poorer body image in these early-maturing girls.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that a woman with bound feet was limited in her ability to take part in politics, social life and the world, due to her {{restricted}} mobility. Bound feet rendered women dependent on their families, particularly their men, as they became largely restricted to their homes. The early Chinese feminist Qiu Jin, who underwent the painful process of unbinding her own bound feet, attacked footbinding and other traditional practices. She argued that women, by retaining their small bound feet, made themselves subservient as it would mean women imprisoning themselves indoors. She believed that women should emancipate themselves from oppression, that <b>girls</b> <b>can</b> ensure their independence through education, and that they should develop new mental and physical qualities fitting for the new era. The ending of the practice is seen as a significant event in the process of female emancipation in China.|$|E

Many applaud these changes, arguing that Nancy has not really changed at all other than learning to use a cell phone. Others praise the series as more realistic; Nancy, these commentators argue, is now a less-perfect and therefore more likable being, one whom <b>girls</b> <b>can</b> more easily relate to– a better role model than the old Nancy because she can actually be emulated, rather than a [...] "prissy automaton of perfection." ...|$|E

However in an interview, Gomez stated, during an interview that the song ultimately is a ridicule of the Hollywood life and fame, that was the meaning behind [...] "Smile for the camera, 'cause they're all about to trash ya." [...] Gomez further elaborated on the concept of the song on an interview with Just Jared Jr., saying, It's basically about Hollywood and what people think about it and essentially how plastic it is sometimes. It's fun and I think <b>girls</b> <b>can</b> relate to it somewhat, for me it was because of Hollywood but it can really relate to a mean girl, an ex-boyfriend, to whoever.|$|E
500|$|The film {{includes}} {{an interview with}} a man referring to himself as [...] "Vlad", who formerly trafficked in humans and drugs in Europe for eleven years. Vlad explains that traffickers control their victims by drugging them, physically abusing them, or threatening to abuse them. He claims that traffickers consider themselves most successful when the exploited girls start responding immediately to shouted, one-word commands. Vlad describes beating girls who tried to run away and says that he felt little remorse after such incidents; the large sums of money involved made him indifferent to the girls' fate. Vlad surmises that the reason global sex trafficking has expanded is that <b>girls</b> <b>can</b> be sold for sex repeatedly, while drugs can only be sold once. When asked how sex trafficking can function on an international scale, Vlad states that the two major contributory factors are organized crime and political corruption.|$|E
500|$|Both Schooley's and McCorkle's own daughters {{inspired}} them {{to conceive}} Kim as [...] "a character that our daughters and other <b>girls</b> <b>can</b> look up to", all-the-while {{aware of the}} [...] "ancient truism" [...] that while girls seldom hesitate to watch a show about a male lead, boys are usually less {{willing to do the}} opposite. Thus, the writers decided to reverse traditional gender roles by making Kim the show's competent action hero and Ron her [...] "fumbling" [...] sidekick, longing to provide young girls with [...] "a character that they can pretend to be" [...] similar to their own childhood heroes, fictional spy James Bond and Captain Kirk from Star Trek. According to McCorkle, Kim has much more in common with James Bond than comic book superheroes. The recurring character Monique was created because Schooley and McCorkle felt that it would be more realistic if Kim had a female best friend in addition to Ron.|$|E

500|$|Speaking of the song's lyrical background, Cruz told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul: [...] "Its about {{breaking}} a girl's heart, {{but in a}} way that's kinda not on purpose. It's more that I'm just a single guy, trying to be single and trying to remain single. And sometimes, when you are in that place, you get girls who wanna be a part of what you're about – but, because you're not really ready for a relationship, those <b>girls</b> <b>can</b> end up being heartbroken. So what I'm basically saying is 'I might just break your heart. But I'm only gonna break your heart if you come through this way right now'." [...] Cruz also has called his song [...] "catchy" [...] with a [...] "good melody" [...] and [...] "fun topic", stating that [...] "both girls and guys can get into this character". In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Cruz elaborated and said the song was partially based on a personal situation, and rather an [...] "exaggeration of an experience".|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} traditions and customs {{that have been}} an {{important}} part of Indian culture for hundreds of years. Religious laws and expectations, or [...] "personal laws" [...] enumerated by each specific religion, often conflict with the Indian Constitution, eliminating rights and powers women should legally have. [...] Despite these crossovers in legality, the Indian government does not interfere with religion and the personal laws they hold. Indian society is largely composed of hierarchical systems within families and communities. [...] These hierarchies can be broken down into age, sex, ordinal position, kinship relationships (within families), and caste, lineage, wealth, occupations, and relationship to ruling power (within the community). [...] When hierarchies emerge within the family based on social convention and economic need, girls in poorer families suffer twice the impact of vulnerability and stability. [...] From birth, girls are automatically entitled to less; from playtime, to food, to education, <b>girls</b> <b>can</b> expect to always be entitled to less than their brothers. [...] Girls also have less access to their family's income and assets, which is exacerbated among poor, rural Indian families. [...] From the start, it is understood that females will be burdened with strenuous work and exhausting responsibilities {{for the rest of their}} lives, always with little to no compensation or recognition.|$|E
500|$|With {{its main}} duo finally established, Kim Possible became the easiest show Schooley and McCorkle had ever developed. One of Disney Channel's {{earliest}} forays into developing an entirely original animated series [...] "from scratch", Kim Possible was {{born out of}} the creators' realization that there were few animated series starring strong female characters at the time and created Kim as [...] "a character that ... <b>girls</b> <b>can</b> look up to", inspired by their own young daughters. The creators were also influenced by their own childhood heroes James Bond and Captain Kirk from Star Trek, and wanted Kim to resemble a character their daughters could idolise similarly. Despite being a [...] "strong female role model", Schooley maintained that heroism [...] "doesn't help [...] a bit when she comes face-to-face with her latest school crush." [...] Unlike traditional superheroes, Kim is entirely devoid of both superpowers and a secret identity; the creators avoided making the character [...] "impervious" [...] like most comic book superheroes tend to be because they wanted both her and Ron to remain relatable to younger viewers. Working completely independently from government spy organizations, Kim's crime-fighting abilities are drawn from real-life activities such as cheerleading and gymnastics, [...] "something that any kid…in the world could do", according to the creators.|$|E

500|$|William Luis {{argues that}} How the García Girls Lost Their Accents [...] "is {{an attempt to}} {{understand}} memory, the past and a time before the sisters lost their innocence and accents". Memory {{plays a significant role}} in the text, as a means by which the <b>girls</b> <b>can</b> return to the past of their childhood in the attempt to make sense of their present-day realities. The youngest child, Sofía carries with her only a single memory of her brief childhood on the island, in which the García's Haitian maid, Chucha, says a voodoo goodbye to the girls before they leave for the United States. Sofía feels segregated and deprived [...] "because she has only this one memory to help her reconstruct her bicultural, bilingual self. Though this lack of memory makes her the least divided of her sisters in many ways... the most disturbed, the most rebellious against her circumstances." [...] Ironically enough, Chucha’s voodoo prediction itself is largely concerned with the concept of memory, as she insists that after leaving the island the girls [...] "will be haunted by what they do and don't remember. But they have spirit in them. They will invent what they need to survive". Julie Barak confirms this notion of memory as both a positive and negative force in the García girls’ constant struggle to unearth their true identities.|$|E
500|$|When Homer {{turns on}} the truck radio, the song [...] "Wannabe" [...] by the Spice <b>Girls</b> <b>can</b> be heard. Originally, a [...] "trucker song" [...] about [...] "a horrible wreck out on old 95" [...] would be heard. The song was a {{reference}} to the [...] "Wreck of the Old 97", a famous locomotive that crashed in 1903 and inspired the country ballad of the same name. It was sung by main cast member Dan Castellaneta, included mentions of [...] "scraping blood and guts off the road" [...] and was eventually dropped because it was considered too gruesome by the staff. The song was later included as a deleted scene on The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season DVD box set. While eating dinner at Joe's Diner, [...] "12 Bar Blues" [...] by NRBQ (a band that Mike Scully was fond of) can be heard playing from a jukebox. According to producer Ian Maxtone-Graham, the doorbell tune in the episode [...] "has a history with The Simpsons", as it is also Homer and Marge's wedding song. [...] "Maximum Homerdrive" [...] features the first appearance of Señor Ding-Dong, who is a recurring character in the series. He is portrayed by Castellaneta, the voice behind many characters. Red Barclay, the trucker who dies of [...] "beef poisoning" [...] in The Slaughterhouse, was portrayed by regular cast member Hank Azaria, who voices many characters in the series. Barclay's voice is slightly based on that of American actor Gary Busey. The two Jehovah's witnesses were portrayed by Pamela Hayden and Karl Wiedergott.|$|E
500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik {{integrated}} the band's typical punk and funk style, but {{moved away}} from this with more melodically driven songs. Tracks like [...] "The Righteous and the Wicked", [...] "Suck My Kiss", [...] "Blood Sugar Sex Magik", [...] "Give it Away" [...] and [...] "Funky Monks" [...] still incorporated use of heavy metal guitar riffs, but differed from Mother's Milk in that they contained less distortion. Flea, who had centered his bass playing around the slapping technique, downplayed on this {{in favor of more}} traditional and melodic bass lines. He also adopted a minimalist, [...] "less is more" [...] philosophy: [...] "I was trying to play simply on Blood Sugar Sex Magik because I had been playing too much prior to that, so I thought, 'I've really got to chill out and play half as many notes'. When you play less, it's more exciting—there's more room for everything. If I do play something busy, it stands out, instead of the bass being a constant onslaught of notes. Space is good." [...] Kiedis felt that the album would expand the Chili Peppers' musical horizons, and that it was a departure from their previous material. One of Blood Sugar Sex Magiks more melodic tracks, [...] "Breaking the Girl", was written about Kiedis' constantly shifting relationships. He feared that he was following in his father's footsteps and simply becoming a womanizer, rather than establishing stable and long-term relationships: [...] "...As exciting and temporarily fulfilling as this constant influx of interesting and beautiful <b>girls</b> <b>can</b> be, {{at the end of the}} day, that shit is lonely and you're left with nothing." [...] The track also featured a bridge in the middle, consisting of percussion instruments salvaged from a garbage dump.|$|E
