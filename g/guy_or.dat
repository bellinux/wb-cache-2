25|$|<b>Guy</b> <b>or</b> Guido Pallavicini, called Marchesopoulo by his Greek subjects, was {{the first}} marquess of Bodonitsa in Frankish Greece from 1204 to his death in or shortly after 1237. He {{was one of the}} most {{important}} Frankish rulers in Greece, and played a major role in the short-lived Kingdom of Thessalonica: in 1208–1209 he supported the Lombard rebellion against King Demetrius of Montferrat, but by 1221 he was the kingdom's regent (bailli), and was left to defend the city against the ruler of Epirus, Theodore Komnenos Doukas. Left unsupported by the Latin Empire, and with a projected crusade to relieve the city delayed, he surrendered the city in December 1224. The belated arrival of the crusade helped to save his own fief from falling to the Epirotes, however, and he was soon able to return there, dying on or shortly after 1237.|$|E

2500|$|At a basic level, {{historical}} revisionism is {{a common}} and not especially controversial process of developing and refining the writing of history. Much more controversial [...] is the reversal of moral findings, which the heroes, good <b>guys,</b> <b>or</b> positive forces are depicted as villains, bad <b>guys,</b> <b>or</b> negative forces. This revisionism is quickly challenged by the supporters of the old view, often in heated terms. It becomes historical negationism, a form of historical revisionism that presents a re-interpretation of the moral meaning of the historical record. The term [...] "revisionism" [...] is used pejoratively by people who charge that revisionists are deliberately distorting the true historical record.|$|R

500|$|In {{response}} to a reviewer's criticism of Bond as villainous, Fleming said in a 1964 Playboy interview {{that he did not}} consider his character to be particularly evil or good: [...] "I don't think that he is necessarily a good <b>guy</b> <b>or</b> a bad guy. Who is? He's got his vices and very few perceptible virtues except patriotism and courage, which are probably not virtues anyway... But I didn't intend for him to be a particularly likeable person." [...] Fleming agreed with some critics' characterisation of Bond as an unthinking killer, but expressed that he was a product of his time: [...] "James Bond is a healthy, violent, noncerebral man in his middle-thirties, and a creature of his era. I wouldn't say he's particularly typical of our times, but he's certainly of the times." ...|$|E

[...] Cochin Haneefa, Charle, Kalabhavan Mani, Shanmugarajan and Saurabh Shukla make cameo appearances as delinquent citizens. Haneefa played an indifferent car owner who refuses to help an accident victim as he does not want his [...] "brand new car" [...] to be soiled with blood. Following Haneefa's death in February 2010, Vikram recalled the actor's appearance in the film and said, [...] "Though he'd come only in a few scenes no one could miss him.

Of this Robbie said, [...] "In one of the blocks she is talking to Bridget about their 'first time' and Donna asks Bridget if {{it was with a}} <b>guy</b> <b>or</b> girl? I liked the way the writers {{conveyed}} that, it was just really subtle and they didn't make a big coming out scene of it. I think it's a good message to send out because it's not such a big deal to lots of people. Not all of them have such drama surrounding it". Donna's first storyline that included this aspect of her character was a kiss between herself and fellow female character, Sunny Lee (Hany Lee). The kiss occurs after Donna discovers that Sunny has been writing the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is shocked when Donna leans over and kisses her on the lips, as it is her first kiss. The show's producers called the kiss between Sunny and Donna as [...] "impulsive" [...] and Robbie agreed saying [...] "It's really not a big deal at all. It's not an actual gay storyline, it's just kind of an impulsive peck". The storyline came weeks after rival soap Home and Away endured a backlash to its own same-sex romance.|$|E
500|$|... "Worst Episode Ever" [...] {{was written}} by Larry Doyle and {{directed}} by Matthew Nastuk. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on February4,2001. The episode was originally called [...] "The Fiver", {{a reference to a}} scene in the episode that was eventually removed. The episode title was then changed to [...] "Worst Episode Ever", a title which the staff were amused by. According to Doyle, [...] "Worst Episode Ever" [...] is the first episode in which Comic Book Guy has a major role. Because Comic Book Guy is usually sarcastic and unfriendly, the series' staff found it hard to make the character seem likable. For example, Hank Azaria, who plays Comic Book Guy among other characters in the series, had a difficult time trying to make the character sound sincere. [...] "Comic Book Guy only ever pronounces things sarcastically", Azaria said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "It was hard {{to find a way to}} sound believable and have him say sincere things. It took a lot of different takes." [...] Executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully said, [...] "It's tough when you take a character like Comic Book <b>Guy</b> <b>or</b> Krusty or Moe, to make them suddenly sympathetic and vulnerable. You have to cheat the character a little bit to open them up emotionally a little more." ...|$|E

500|$|Craig has {{described}} {{his portrayal of}} Bond as an anti-hero: [...] "The question I keep asking myself while playing the role is, 'Am I the good <b>guy</b> <b>or</b> just a bad guy {{who works for the}} good side?' Bond's role, after all, is that of an assassin when you come down to it. I have never played a role in which someone's dark side shouldn't be explored. I don't think it should be confusing {{by the end of the}} film, but during the film you should be questioning who he is." [...] Craig has stated that his own favourite previous Bond actor is Sean Connery, but says, [...] "I'd never copy somebody else. I would never do an impression of anybody else or try and improve on what they did. That would be a pointless exercise for me." [...] His own favourite Bond film is From Russia with Love. On an episode of The South Bank Show, Connery divulged his thoughts on Craig's casting as Bond, whom he described as [...] "fantastic, marvellous in the part". When told that Craig had taken particular note of his performances, Connery said that he was [...] "flattered" [...] and that Craig really gets the [...] "danger element" [...] to Bond's character. Craig has remarked that Bond is [...] "...actually a misogynist... A lot of women are drawn to him chiefly because he embodies a certain kind of danger and never sticks around for too long." ...|$|E

But somewhere along the line, the show's shine faded, its image was tarnished, and the magic disappeared", but added, [...] "That's not to say that FG hasn't been good at all lately. Season 8 certainly had a few good episodes including the season opener, [...] "Road to the Multiverse", which had a clever premise that was executed well. But after the first episode, the quality of the stories started to decline". He listed [...] "Brian's Got a Brand New Bag", [...] "Jerome Is the New Black", [...] "Go Stewie Go", [...] "Peter-assment" [...] and [...] "April in Quahog" [...] as the worst episodes of the season. Isler praised the [...] "tail end of the season", however, citing [...] "Brian & Stewie" [...] as [...] "one of the better efforts the show has ever put out." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume eight DVD, Frank Rizzo of DVD Talk said, [...] "The episodes stand on their own, whether you care about the dependence on easy gags and gimmicky concepts or not, because they are simply funny." [...] Rizzo commented on the DVD release: [...] "Fans of Family <b>Guy,</b> <b>or</b> any of MacFarlane's series for that matter, have to be concerned that the very reason the series continues to air, the DVDs the fans buy, are getting diluted and weakened, especially when you're getting less extras, less MacFarlane, and, for the first time, less of the commentaries that give you a peek into the show's creation." ...|$|E

Myers wrote a series of ten bulletins for distribution to national chess federations, entitled F.I.D.E. Facts, that criticized Keene, as well as Lucena supporters such as Kasparov and David Levy. The November 1986 issue of CHESS magazine contained a written response, drafted by Myers and signed by Campomanes, to Keene's charges against Campomanes. Myers also created a cartoon that portrayed Lucena as a marionette controlled by Keene and Levy. Just before the election, Lucena withdrew, ensuring Campomanes' victory. Myers took credit for Campomanes' reelection, writing, [...] "It could be reasonably argued that Campomanes was either a good <b>guy</b> <b>or</b> a bad guy, but I'm proud that discovering the truth and telling it proved that his opponents were worse." ...|$|E
2500|$|The secretive {{attitude}} and gradual unfolding of Snape's character was broadly admired, with Stephen Fry, the UK audio books narrator, saying in 2003: [...] "Most characters like Snape {{are hard to}} love {{but there is a}} sort of ambiguity—you can’t quite decide—something sad about him—lonely and it’s fascinating when you think he’s going to be the evil one..., then slowly you get this idea he’s not so bad after all." [...] David Yates, who directed the final four films of the series, also expressed his views on the character, saying: [...] "A character like Snape, where you're not really sure if he's a good <b>guy</b> <b>or</b> a bad guy, that gives you a latent tension... I think the coolest thing you can do with an audience is deny them a little bit of information." [...] Despite being less than kind, the character quickly gained popularity within fandom to a level that surprised Rowling herself. Joyce Millman suggests in her essay [...] "To Sir with Love" [...] in the book Mapping the World of Harry Potter, that Snape is derived from a tradition of Byronic heroes such as Wuthering Heights Heathcliff.|$|E

2500|$|Despite his {{limited number}} of appearances, the {{character}} of Darius has an important moral influence in the show.

The basic premise is that 's a hero and he goes around kicking the ass of the bad guys. Now you have this character in Darius who shows up and says, 'Yes, but is it actually a good goal to kick the ass of the bad guys?' Even though Mac has to be a good guy who has to fight the bad guys, you set up this scenario where one of his closest friends has questioned whether beating up bad guys makes you a good <b>guy</b> <b>or</b> whether you should be a man of peace.

In their debut match they lost to the team of Pancho Ramírez and Monje Loco. After wrestling from under a year González came into contact with Elías Simón, {{who was one of the}} main wrestling promoters in the North of Mexico at the time. Simón suggested that González needed a new ring identity and suggested [...] "El Hijo del Médico Asesino", a storyline son of recently deceased Médico Asesino. González liked the idea of a [...] "Doctor" [...] character but wanted to build his own identity and not live off the name of someone else. After giving it some thought González came up with the name [...] "Dr. Wagner", inspired by the German composer Richard Wagner, and his new ring identity was born.

Dr. Wagner quickly earned the nickname [...] "El Galeno del Mal" [...] ("The Doctor of Evil") for his brutal style of wrestling and his cheating ways.
