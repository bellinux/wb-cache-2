5|$|A {{number of}} lives of Edward {{were written in}} the centuries {{following}} his death {{in which he was}} portrayed as a martyr, generally seen as a victim of the Queen Dowager Ælfthryth, mother of Æthelred. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>today</b> recognized as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Anglican Communion.|$|E
5|$|Later, in the 18th and 19th centuries, {{the likes}} of John Wesley, Thomas de Quincey and Benjamin Disraeli the latter of which was MP for Shrewsbury 1841–47, would visit the town. Charles Dickens once also visited to present a series of lectures at the Music Hall, staying at the Lion Hotel. However, in this period the town's most {{prolific}} literary figure and famous son was born – Charles Darwin. Darwin was educated at Shrewsbury School and later, {{with the development of}} his 1859 work On the Origin of Species became the preeminent naturalist of the 19th century. Although Darwin's work was both revolutionary and highly controversial at the time, his teachings and beliefs have become ever more globalised and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>today</b> widely recognised as the father of the modern theory of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Christchurch and its {{surrounding}} areas are unique in New Zealand for their particular style of Gothic architecture, {{something that can be}} directly attributed to Benjamin Mountfort. While Mountfort did accept small private domestic commissions, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>today</b> better known for the designs executed for public, civic bodies, and the church. His monumental Gothic stone civic buildings in Christchurch, which would not be out of place in Oxford or Cambridge, are an amazing achievement over adversity of materials. His hallmark wooden Gothic churches today epitomise the 19th-century province of Canterbury. They are accepted, and indeed appear as part of the landscape. In this way, Benjamin Mountfort's achievement was to make his favoured style of architecture synonymous with the identity of the province of Canterbury. Following his death, one of his seven children, Cyril, continued to work in his father's Gothic style well into the 20th century. Cyril Mountfort was responsible for the church of St Luke's in the City, which was an unexecuted design of his father's. In this way, and through the daily public use of his many buildings, Mountfort's legacy lives on. He ranks today with his contemporary R A Lawson as one of New Zealand's greatest 19th-century architects.|$|E

25|$|Tevez has a {{distinctive}} burn scar that runs down his neck from {{his right ear}} to his chest. He was accidentally scalded with boiling water as a child, which caused third-degree burns and kept him hospitalised in intensive care for nearly two months.

25|$|Orlande de Lassus (also Roland de Lassus, Orlando di Lasso, Orlandus Lassus, Orlande de Lattre or Roland de Lattre; 1532, {{possibly}} 1530 – 14 June 1594) was a Netherlandish or Franco-Flemish composer of {{the late}} Renaissance. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>today</b> {{considered to be the}} chief representative of the mature polyphonic style of the Franco-Flemish school, and one of the three most famous and influential musicians in Europe {{at the end of the}} 16th century (the other two being Palestrina and Victoria).|$|E

25|$|Although Ghalib {{himself was}} far prouder of his poetic {{achievements}} in Persian, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>today</b> more {{famous for his}} Urdu ghazals. Numerous elucidations of Ghalib's ghazal compilations {{have been written by}} Urdu scholars. The first such elucidation or Sharh was written by Ali Haider Nazm Tabatabai of Hyderabad during the rule of the last Nizam of Hyderabad. Before Ghalib, the ghazal was primarily an expression of anguished love; but Ghalib expressed philosophy, the travails and mysteries of life and wrote ghazals on many other subjects, vastly expanding the scope of the ghazal.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} medieval statesman of Sweden, {{and one of}} {{the principal}} architects of its rise as a nation – Birger Jarl the Regent – practically ruled the land from 1248 to 1266. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>today</b> revered as the founder of Stockholm and as the creator of national legislations. His reforms {{paved the way for the}} abolition of serfdom. The increased respect and power which later royals owed to Birger Jarl were further extended by his son, King Magnus Ladulås (1275–90). Both these rulers, by the institution of separate and almost independent duchies, attempted to introduce into Sweden a feudal system similar to that already established in continental Europe; the danger of thus weakening the realm by partition was averted, though not without violent and tragic complications by the opponents, the Folkung party. (The term Folkung also later referred to Earl Birger's descendants, forming the royal Folkunge of Bjelbo dynasty.) Finally, in 1319, the severed portions of Sweden were once more reunited.|$|E
25|$|Returning its {{attention}} to the conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the United Nations responded to Suez Crisis of 1956, a war between the alliance of the United Kingdom, France, and Israel, and Egypt, which was supported by other Arab nations. When a ceasefire was declared in 1957, Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs (and future Prime Minister) Lester Bowles Pearson suggested that the United Nations station a peacekeeping force in the Suez {{in order to ensure}} that the ceasefire was honored by both sides. Pearson had initially suggested that the force consist of mainly Canadian soldiers, but the Egyptians were suspicious of having a Commonwealth nation defend them against the United Kingdom and her allies. In the end, a wide variety of national forces were drawn upon to ensure national diversity. Pearson would win the Nobel Peace Prize for this work, and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>today</b> considered a father of modern peacekeeping.|$|E

500|$|The Coral Island was {{an almost}} instant success, and was {{translated}} into almost every European language within fifty years of its publication. It was widely admired by its contemporary readers, although modern critics view the text as featuring [...] "dated colonialist themes and arguably racist undertones".

500|$|Though earlier historians saw Pembroke as {{the head}} of a 'middle party', between the {{extremes}} of Lancaster and the king, the modern consensus is that he remained essentially loyal to Edward throughout most of his career. Pembroke was married twice, and left no legitimate issue, though he did have a bastard son. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>today</b> remembered primarily through his wife's, Marie de St Pol, foundation of Pembroke College, Cambridge, and for his splendid tomb that can still be seen in Westminster Abbey.

500|$|During a {{diplomatic}} mission, Captain Picard is injured by terrorists and dies. He awakes {{to find himself}} in an otherwordly realm, where he is greeted by the god-like alien Q. [...] He explains that the peculiar weapon that shot Picard destroyed his artificial heart, and that a natural heart would have survived. [...] Picard lost his original heart as a young officer, when he was stabbed during a bar brawl, an event that he regrets and led to him becoming the disciplined and restrained man <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>today.</b> [...] When Picard remarks {{that he would do}} things differently if he could relive that moment, Q sends Picard back in time to two days before the brawl, where he meets with fellow cadets and friends Corey Zweller and Marta Batanides.

500|$|Bal Thackeray refuted the allegations, saying, [...] "Amitabh Bachchan is an open-minded person, he {{has great}} love for Maharashtra, and this is evident on many occasions. The actor has often said that Maharashtra and {{specially}} Mumbai has given him great fame and affection. He has also said that what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>today</b> {{is because of the}} love people have given him. The people of Mumbai have always acknowledged him as an artiste. It was utter foolishness to make these parochial allegations against him. Amitabh is a global superstar. People all over the world respect him. This cannot be forgotten by anyone. Amitabh should ignore these silly accusations and concentrate on his acting". According to some reports, Raj's censure of Amitabh, whom he supposedly admires, stemmed from his disappointment of not being invited to the wedding of Amitabh's son, Abhishek, despite invitations to his estranged uncle Bal and cousin Uddhav.|$|E
500|$|... 7 Khoon Maaf {{tells the}} story of an Anglo-Indian woman, Susanna Anna-Marie Johannes (Priyanka Chopra), who murders all her husbands. Susanna tries to find love, but six of her seven husbands have a flaw which proves fatal. The killings (and her yearning for love) are {{explained}} by the loss of her mother at a young age. The story is told by a young forensic pathologist, Arun (Vivaan Shah), to his wife, Nandini (Konkona Sen Sharma). Arun has watched Susanna since their childhood, and has a secret crush on her. He owes his life to her; she funded his education, making him what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>today.</b> Arun tells his wife that Susanna has committed suicide, leaving him a note congratulating him on his marriage. The doctor must now confirm that the body found is Susanna's. Arun is unable to overcome his grief over her death and pours out his heart to his wife, who listens patiently.|$|E

"Someday (Place in the Sun)" [...] {{is about}} how Tinie started in the cold, harsh streets of London and had to face many {{obstacles}} {{to get to where}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>today</b> (his 'place in the sun'). [...] "Don't Sell Out" [...] incorporates elements of Tamil Cinema that meld into the hip hop and trap genres throughout the song. Tinie wrote it after hearing [...] "Kalasala Kalasala" [...] by Vaali and S. S. Thaman and thinking the words sounded like 'don't sell out'. Balistiq sampled the song and sent the track to Tinie, who used this as a basis for the song. He decided to create a song poking fun at the term [...] "selling out", due to how frequently and foolishly it is used. [...] "Looking Down the Barrel" [...] follows on from where Disc-Overy track [...] "Obsession" [...] left off: it's the second track where Tempah's spoken his random thoughts on fame, life, relationships and success. He decided to fill the track with 'random retorts and different tangents he was going off on'. The song was produced by Tom Rowlands of The Chemical Brothers, and the song's sample was selected by Rowlands.|$|E
