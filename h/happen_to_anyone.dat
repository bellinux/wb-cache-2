5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea of Final Destination, or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, that that could <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone.</b> And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different way in which they react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E
5|$|The {{film is a}} {{domestic}} thriller telling of a family's destruction {{by the introduction of}} a sexually predatory femme fatale into the household. A composer has just moved into a two-story house {{with his wife and two}} children. When his wife becomes exhausted from working at a sewing machine to support the family, the composer hires a housemaid to help with the work around the house. The new housemaid behaves strangely, catching rats with her hands, spying on the composer, seducing him and eventually becoming pregnant by him. The composer's wife convinces the housemaid to induce a miscarriage by falling down a flight of stairs. After this incident, the housemaid's behavior becomes increasingly more erratic. She kills the composer's son, and then persuades the composer to commit suicide with her by swallowing rat poison. The film ends with the composer reading the story from a newspaper with his wife. The narrative of the film has apparently been told by the composer, who then warns the film audience that this is just the sort of thing could <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone.</b>|$|E

With two races of the season remaining and an eight-point deficit after losing {{the lead in the}} Drivers' Championship, Häkkinen remained confident about his title chances: [...] "I know that what happened to me in the last Grand Prix, when I had to retire, can <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone,</b> It could happen to Michael. So I am very optimistic. I have come here prepared and thinking about these two races together. Not one, two." [...] Michael Schumacher emphasised the pressure of leading the championship going into Japan: [...] "It hasn't been a relaxing time at all and I still haven't completely got over the jetlag from the States. But I'm prepared to sacrifice this and a lot more to bring the title back to Maranello. And {{the same can be said}} of the entire team." [...] Ferrari team principal Jean Todt and former World Champion Jody Scheckter called for Barrichello and Coulthard to race fairly as both drivers were ordered by their teams to assist their teammates in the Championship battle.|$|E

Count the Kicks is a fantastic charity, which aims to teach expectant mothers about noticing changes in their pregnancy to reduce the risk of stillbirth. And working with Sands has helped me understand how Mercedes would cope with life after her baby has died. Mercedes has already been through so much tragedy in her life, but the death of her son will show a much more fragile side to her character. The scripts are brilliantly written by Anna Clements and with the help of the two charities, I was able to really understand what Mercedes is going through." [...] Erica Stewart, the bereavement support services manager at Sands, said: [...] "We're pleased to have been approached by the researchers and writers at Hollyoaks for advice and help to ensure that this heartbreaking storyline is portrayed truthfully and sensitively. Stillbirth is not rare and it's a tragedy that can <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone.</b> Sadly thousands of babies die each year in the UK. In 2013, over 100 babies every week were stillborn or died soon after birth. For a show like Hollyoaks with a youth focus to be covering this devastating experience is a brilliant way of raising awareness of the issues surrounding baby death among a younger audience who may have not otherwise come across them." [...] Metcalfe later further discussed the storyline, revealing that when she read the scripts she had [...] "a lump in my throat", which made cry and when she had finished reading the scripts, she was [...] "sat their sobbing". She continued to say: [...] "When it came to playing it on set I did minimal rehearsals because I didn't want to wear out the true meaning of the words." [...] before praising the script writing, calling them [...] "brilliant" [...] and stating she did not have to work hard to find the [...] "level of emotion", [...] "The words were all there on the page.

The current statute gives survivors sufficient time for litigation, and a lifetime to bring charges to criminal court. Survivors and non-survivors alike need legal protection. The law as it stands, does both.

[...] As the show progressed, Alexander discovered that the character was based on David. As Alexander explains in an interview for the Seinfeld DVD, during an early conversation with David, Alexander questioned a script, saying, [...] "This could never <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone,</b> and even if it did, no human being would react like this." [...] David replied, [...] "What do you mean? This happened to me once, and this is exactly how I reacted."

First Amendment expert Eugene Volokh has commented about this Louisville case, saying that a pertinent U.S. Supreme Court precedent on this subject is Oklahoma Publishing v.

Oklahoma Publishing Co. v. District Court (1977) expressly rejected the notion that courts or legislatures may bar the publication of the names of juvenile offenders; that case involved a newspaper's publishing the name of the juvenile offender, which it learned from a court hearing, but the rationale applies at least as strongly to a person's publishing a name that she learned from the attack itself." ...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change and}} other harmful {{large-scale}} processes challenge our understandings of individual responsibility. People {{throughout the world}} suffer harms—severe shortfalls in health, civic status, or standard of living relative to the vital needs of human beings—as a result of physical processes to which many people appear to contribute. Climate change, polluted air and water, and the erosion of grasslands, for example, occur because {{a great many people}} emit carbon and pollutants, build excessively, enable their flocks to overgraze, or otherwise stress the environment. If a much smaller number of people engaged in these types of conduct, the harms in question would not occur, or would be substantially lessened. However, the conduct of any particular person (and, in the case of climate change, of even quite large numbers of people) could make no apparent difference to their occurrence. My carbon emissions (and quite possibly the carbon emissions of much larger groups of people dispersed throughout the world) may not make a difference <b>to</b> what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone.</b> When the conduct of some agent does not make any apparent difference to the occurrence of harm, but this conduct is of a type that brings about harm because many people engage in it, we can call this agent an overdeterminer of that harm, and their conduct overdetermining conduct.

The {{full extent of}} Malvina's {{activities}} during those few midsummer weeks, till the return of Flight Commander Raffleton, will never perhaps be fully revealed. According to the Doctor, the whole business has been grossly exaggerated. There are those who talk as if half the village had been taken to pieces, altered and improved and sent back home again in a mental state unrecognisable by their own mothers. Certain it is that Dawson, R.A., generally described by everybody except his wife as [...] "a lovable little man," [...] and whose only fault was an incurable habit of punning, both in season--if such a period there be--and more often out, suddenly one morning smashed a Dutch interior, fifteen inches by nine, over the astonished head of Mrs. Dawson.

Mrs. Dawson, a handsome, high-spirited woman herself, may have found Dawson, as originally fashioned, trying to the nerves; though even then the question arises: Why have married him?
