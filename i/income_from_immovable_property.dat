40|$|The {{discussion}} {{regarding the}} interaction between Article 6 (<b>Income</b> <b>from</b> <b>Immovable</b> <b>Property),</b> Article 7 (Business Profits) and Article 21 (Other Income) of the OECD Model is not new. However, the historical documents of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which have now been made available, throw {{new light on the}} issue. It has been argued that Article 6 (4), and not Article 7 (4), governs the relationship between Articles 6 and 7, therefore excluding the possibility of applying Article 7 to any <b>income</b> <b>from</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property.</b> Therefore, it is argued, that Article 21 is the only correct distributive rule to apply in cases where the bilateral scope of Article 6 is not satisfied. This article traces the evolution of Article 6, as evidenced by the historical documents, which reveals a different intention underlying Article 6 (4) ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{accepted}} that tax treaties should allocate primary taxing rights over immovable property and <b>income</b> <b>from</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> to the situs state; {{the state in}} which a taxpayer has a permanent establishment (PE) should have priority over the state of its residence {{in so far as}} the taxation of income attributable to that PE is concerned. However, structural inconsistencies within tax treaties prevent these policies from being reconciled, which may enable tax avoidance. In analysing the relevant historical documents, one discovers a previously discarded solution, which allocates primary taxing rights to the situs state, secondary rights to the PE state and tertiary rights to the residence state...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between the Articles 6, 7 and 21 of the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD Model), {{and in particular the}} scope of the exception for immovable property in Article 21 (2), has been widely debated in academic literature. The approach proposed in this article gives the immovable property exception a proper role, thus defining the {{relation between}} the Articles 6, 7 and 21 of the OECD Model in e. g. triangular cases involving immovable property of an enterprise. In the case of immovable property of an enterprise that is situated in the residence state (State R) or in a third state (State T) and that is attributable to a permanent establishment (PE) in the other contracting state (State S), the author takes the view that the ‘context’ within the meaning of Article 3 (2) of the R-S tax treaty prevents State S from categorizing the income under Article 7, regardless of its domestic law classification of the income as business profits. This context consists, inter alia, of Article 21 (2) of the R-S tax treaty. Consequently, Article 21 (1) of the R-S tax treaty must be applied in respect of the income from the immovable property located in State R or in State T, assigning the exclusive taxation right under this treaty to State R. To reinforce the proposed approach, the author recommends adding language to the OECD Commentary on Article 21 which confirms the inapplicability of Article 7 to <b>income</b> <b>from</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> situated in State R or State T. Regardless of the proposed changes to the OECD Commentary, the author believes that the effectiveness of the exclusion of immovable property from the scope of Article 21 (2) could be further improved by amending Article 21 as suggested...|$|E
50|$|Personal {{property}} {{is a type}} of property. In the common law systems personal property may also be called chattels. It is distinguished from real property, or real estate. In the civil law systems personal {{property is}} often called movable property or movables - any property that can be moved from one location or another. This term is used to distinguish <b>property</b> that different <b>from</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> or <b>immovables,</b> such as land and buildings. This also means the direct owner of the item(s) is in full control of them/it until either stolen, confiscated by law enforcement, or destroyed.|$|R

If the man did not leave any children, his wives receive a quarter of the property and the remaining three quarters is shared by the blood relatives of the husband (for example, parents, siblings). If he had children from any of his wives, his wives receive an eighth of the property and the rest is for his surviving children and parents. The wives share as inheritance a part of movable property of her late husband, but they do not share anything <b>from</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> [...] such as land, real estate, farm or such value. A woman's deferred mahr and the dead husband's outstanding debts are paid before any inheritance is applied. Sharia mandates that inheritance include male relatives of the dead person, that a daughter receive half the inheritance as a son, and a widow receives less than her daughters.|$|R

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. Africa {{has been}} {{experiencing}} significant {{growth over the}} last few years, with many seeing Africa as the next investment destination. This increased growth in international trade and investment could broaden and deepen the tax base for African countries which could be a source of additional tax revenue. In particular, the SADC comprises a group of African countries which has as one of their common goals the promotion of sustainable and equitable economic growth. One possible way of achieving this goal could be through the use of effective tax treaties, allowing for greater retention of taxing rights over income flows from FDI, which could {{go a long way in}} deepening and broadening the tax base for the SADC countries. This could assist the SADC countries in promoting the growth and development of their economies. A greater retention of taxing rights over income by the SADC countries could be achieved through the use of the UN Model. This Model has primarily been designed to assist developing countries in retaining greater taxing rights over income in order to assist with their development and growth. Therefore, this dissertation has primarily focused on the use of and variation from the UN Model treaty clauses by a group of SADC countries in order to determine the extent of the application of the provisions of the UN Model in the SADC countries’ tax treaties. This analysis has specifically considered the distributive rules of the UN Model dealing with the most common forms of income that are likely to arise from FDI, namely: business profits, <b>income</b> <b>from</b> <b>immovable</b> <b>property,</b> dividends, interest, royalties, capital gains, income from employment and pensions. The focus has been on whether the SADC countries have been able to retain greater taxing rights over these forms of income by making use of the provisions of the UN Model. However, at the same time, the analysis also considered the provisions of the OECD Model, as it recognised that the OECD Model is one of the most widely used Models for negotiating tax treaties amongst both developed and developing countries. By considering the provisions of the OECD Model in this dissertation, it has allowed for a useful and meaningful analysis of any variations from the UN Model...|$|E
50|$|Because {{exclusivity}} is {{an exception}} in the Brussels regime, it must interpreted as being such: strictly. For example, an action {{with regards to the}} first exception of <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> must strictly be based on a right in rem, which consequently means that a preventive action geared solely towards halting the nuisance coming <b>from</b> an <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> does not fall under the provision's scope. And with regards to the second exception; e.g. only challenging the validity of a decision of an organ of a company under the company law applicable or under the provisions governing the functions of its organs, as laid down in its Articles of Association, can warrant exclusivity, and not for example, the manner in which power is exercised by an organ of the company. Or finally, take the final exception with regards to the enforcement of judgments; only judgments can fall under the scope of the provision, and not say, preparatory steps such as freezing injunctions.|$|R

40|$|A {{non-resident}} who disposes of {{a direct}} interest in <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> or an indirect interest in <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> through the disposal of shares {{may be subject to}} capital gains tax in the country in which the <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> is situated. Certain African countries were selected and the capital gains tax consequences on disposal of such property were determined by analysing the domestic tax legislation of the country in which the property is situated. In addition, the effect of any applicable double tax agreement ('DTA') to such disposals was considered. In certain countries - such as Angola and Nigeria - in terms of their domestic tax legislation, a non-resident will not be subject to capital gains tax in the respective country where the property is situated regardless {{of the value of the}} shares that is attributable to <b>immovable</b> <b>property.</b> In certain countries - such as Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe - in terms of their domestic tax legislation, a non-resident may be subject to capital gains tax upon the disposal of an interest in <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> in the respective country in which the <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> is held regardless of the value of the shares that is attributable to <b>immovable</b> <b>property,</b> unless a DTA provides otherwise. In certain other countries - such as Botswana, Ghana, Lesotho and South Africa - in terms of their domestic tax legislation, a non-resident may be subject to capital gains tax upon the disposal of an interest in <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> in the respective country in which the <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> is held, however this will depend in general on the percentage of the value of shares that is attributable to <b>immovable</b> <b>property,</b> unless a DTA provides otherwise. Certain countries domestic tax legislation have specific provisions regulating how this percentage is determined. A DTA may provide relief to taxpayers who are subject to capital gains tax in both their resident country and the source country, on the disposal of an interest in <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> held in the source country. In terms of domestic tax legislation, where the non-resident is liable to pay capital gains tax in the source country, the non-resident will in general have to comply with the withholding tax and filing obligations of that country where applicable...|$|R

40|$|<b>Immovable</b> <b>Property</b> under Domestic Law, EU Law and Tax Treaties, {{comprising}} the proceedings and working documents of an annual seminar held in Milan in November 2014, provides a thorough {{analysis of the}} taxation of <b>immovable</b> <b>properties.</b> The analysis starts from {{a survey of the}} concept of “immovable property” in common and civil law jurisdictions and then considers how different approaches affected the taxation of income deriving therefrom. EU tax law issues are then taken into consideration, both <b>from</b> an <b>income</b> tax and VAT viewpoint. In particular, the income tax analysis provides an extensive examination of how taxation of <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> applied by EU Member States may affect fundamental freedoms. The book then moves to selected tax treaty issues. In particular, the analysis examines: (i) the relationships between tax treaty law and national law; (ii) the interaction between articles 6, 7 and 21 of the OECD Model Convention; and (iii) the concept of “enterprise” in the context of article 6 of the OECD Model Convention and its possible implications. Finally, the evolution of article 6 of the OECD Model Convention with respect to <b>income</b> <b>from</b> agriculture, forestry and mining is reviewed. Individual country surveys provide in-depth analyses of the above concepts and issues from a national viewpoint in selected European and North American jurisdictions, as well as in Australia.
