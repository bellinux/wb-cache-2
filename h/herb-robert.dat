And farther, in {{attempting}} such a change, {{we must be}} clear in our own minds whether we wish our nomenclature to {{tell us something about}} the plant itself, or only to tell us the place it holds in relation to other plants: as, for instance, in the <b>Herb-Robert,</b> would it be well to {179} christen it, shortly, 'Rob Roy,' because it is pre-eminently red, and so have done with it;--or rather to dwell on its family connections, and call it 'Macgregoraceous'? ...|$|E

No, the longer I live, the more sure I am that these things are meant for our solace and minor help through the trials of life. I assure you, Phoebe, that the crimson leaf of a <b>Herb-Robert</b> in the hedge has broken a strain of fretful repining, {{and it is one}} great blessing in these pleasures that one never can exhaust them.' ...|$|E

Sheltered by the cliff above from stress of wind, the ash and hazel wood spring there in a fair and perfect freedom, without a diseased bough, or an unwholesome shade. I {{do not know why}} mine is all encumbered with overgrowth, and this so lovely that scarce a branch could be gathered but with injury;--while underneath, the oxalis, and the two smallest geraniums (Lucidum and <b>Herb-Robert)</b> and the mossy saxifrage, and the cross-leaved bed-straw, and the white pansy, wrought themselves into wreaths among the fallen crags, in which every leaf rejoiced, and was at rest.|$|E

Now {{between these}} two states of equally natural growth, the point of {{difference}} that forced itself on me (and practically enough, in the work I had in my own wood), {{was not so much}} the withering and waste of the one, and the life of the other, as the thorniness and cruelty of the one, and the softness of the other. In Malham Cove, the stones of the brook were softer with moss than any silken pillow--the crowded oxalis leaves yielded to the pressure of the hand, and were not felt--the cloven {121} leaves of the <b>Herb-Robert</b> and orbed clusters of its companion overflowed every rent in the rude crags with living balm; there was scarcely a place left by the tenderness of the happy things, where one might not lay down one's forehead on their warm softness, and sleep. But in the waste and distressed ground, the distress had changed itself to cruelty. The leaves had all perished, and the bending saplings, and the wood of trust;--but the thorns were there, immortal, and the gnarled and sapless roots, and the dusty treacheries of decay.|$|E
60|$|The reds we {{like best}} in flowers are the {{delicate}} roseate and pinky shades; {{they are more}} to us than the purest and most luminous tints. And here, as with bird notes which delight us on account of their resemblance to fresh, young, highly musical human voices, flowers please us best when they exhibit the loveliest human tints--the apple blossom and the bindweed, musk mallow and almond and wild rose, for example. After these we are most taken with the deeper but soft and not too luminous reds--the red which we admire in the red horse-chestnut blossom, and many other flowers, down to the minute pimpernel. Next come the intense rosy reds seen in the <b>herb-robert</b> and other wild geraniums, valerian, red campion and ragged robin; and this shade of red, intensified but still soft, {{is seen in the}} willow-herb and foxglove, and, still more intensified, in the bell- and small-leafed heath. Some if not all of these pleasing reds have purple in them, and there are very many distinctly purple flowers that appeal to us {{in the same way that}} red flowers do, receiving their expression from the same cause. There is some purple colour in most skins, and even some blue.|$|E
