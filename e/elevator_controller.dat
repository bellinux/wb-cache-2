50|$|The smooth {{operation}} of a destination dispatch system depends upon each passenger indicating their destination intention separately. In most cases, the elevator system has no way of differentiating a group of passengers from a single passenger if the group's destination is only keyed in a single time. This could potentially lead to an elevator stopping to pick up more passengers than the elevator actually has capacity for, creating delays for other users. This situation is handled by two solutions, a load vane sensor on the elevator or a group function button on keypad. The load vane tells the <b>elevator</b> <b>controller</b> {{that there is a}} high load in car and doesn't stop at other floors until the load is low enough to pick up more passengers. The group function button asks for how many passengers are going to a floor, and then the system sends the correct number of elevators to that floor if available.|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is to propose and justify two general rules that can help to argue the costeffectiveness of use of the formal modelling language Coloured Petri Nets (CPN) : (1) Construction of CPN models should be explicitly based on high-quality documentation that software developers already produce; (2) Use of CPN models should be explicitly seen as prototyping. Rule (1) enables assessment of cost. We want to observe that the ratio of time used on CPN compared to time used on other documentation is small. Rule (2) enables us to argue benefit. Prototyping is seen as beneficial as witnessed by its wide-spread use and high acceptance in the software industry.

40|$|Engineering {{faculty at}} Iowa State University have worked collaboratively with teacher {{education}} faculty since 1996 {{to offer an}} undergraduate course entitled Toying with Technology to {{elementary and secondary education}} majors 1, 2. The development of this technology literacy course provided students with an appreciation for the technological innovations that surround them. Studies have shown that students form many of their overall career and educational attitudes as early as elementary school. Elementary (and even secondary) schoolteachers who have an appreciation for technology will likely convey that appreciation to their students. This will, in turn, broaden the horizons of these students regarding the opportunities they may have regarding careers in scientific and engineering disciplines. Engineering faculty believe the Toying with Technology course is a component of the long-term recruitment of K- 12 students, particularly minorities and women, into technology-based fields 3, 4, 5. This course is designed to explain the principles behind many of the technological innovations in wide use today via a collection of hands-on laboratory experiences based upon simple systems constructed out of LEGOs and controlled by small computers. These laboratory experiences are designed to lead students, literally by their hands-on experimentation, through the use of technology in support of many everyday activities. The lab experiences are simple enough to isolate and illuminate the underlying basic principles and yet complex enough to represent real-world examples. Students typically design and construct simple models of real-world systems, including an <b>elevator</b> and its <b>controller,</b> a garage door and its opener, a computer-controlled car, and a house security system. A significant portion of this course is the many field experiences involving K- 12 students being facilitated in mobile robotics exercises by the pre-service teachers. The literature in recent years shows numerous papers on mobile robotics 1, 2, 6 - 8, many using LEGOs. There also are many references to engineering outreach efforts 3 - 5, 8 - 12. During the summer of 2000 a graduate course incorporating these mobile robotics and scanning electron microscope exercises was offered to in-service teachers and teacher education graduate students. Several of the in-service teachers who took this course are now partnered with the current undergraduate students to provide an on-going relationship among the practicing teacher, the pre-service teachers, the K- 12 students, and the engineering faculty.
