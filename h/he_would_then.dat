5|$|A {{number of}} white jazz musicians {{regularly}} {{performed at the}} club alongside blacks. Jazz guitarist Pat Martino recalls that he began playing at the club as a teenager (in the late 1950s), and would often play until 4am in the morning. After the clubs closed <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>then</b> join guitarists such as Wes Montgomery and Grant Green for breakfast.|$|E

5|$|The Room {{originated}} as a play, {{completed by}} Wiseau in 2001. Wiseau stated he then adapted the play into a 500-page book, {{which he was}} unable to get published. Frustrated, Wiseau decided to adapt the work into a film, which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>then</b> produce himself in order to maintain total control over the project.|$|E

5|$|During the Battle of Vergas, Ibrahim {{decided to}} attack the Maniots from the rear. His plan was to send a small fleet with a few {{soldiers}} to land at the Bay of Diros, 2 kilometers south of Areopolis. The aim of this was to capture the unguarded Areopoli, which cut the communication lines of the defenders at Vergas and demoralize them as well. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>then</b> be able {{to attack the}} Maniots from the rear and control the mountain passes to eastern Mani and Gytheio. Authors Peter Greenhalgh and Edward Eliopoulos describe this plan as excellent.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Muntz {{decided to}} sell blank tapes and VCRs as loss leaders to attract {{customers}} to his showroom, where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>then</b> try to sell them his projection TV systems. His success continued through the early 1980s until he invested heavily in the Technicolor Compact Video Cassette (CVC), a 1/4in(0.6cm) system designed to compete with Betamax, VHS, and the Super 8 film home-movie system. The CVC format failed in the marketplace, sales quickly eroded, and Muntz's store closed soon after.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice {{formally}} joined BOAC on 1 January 1950, {{taking the}} title and role of financial comptroller. The title reflected his intention to provide useful financial information to managers within the company, allowing them to take informed decisions, rather than dictating what the company would be doing from head office. The financial comptroller position became a board position in 1953, and accordingly Smallpeice {{was appointed to the}} board. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>then</b> be promoted to the additional position of deputy chief executive in June 1954.|$|E

5000|$|If {{the third}} {{approach}} fails to eliminate negative thoughts, the fourth approach involves going [...] "to the root" [...] (Pali: vitakka mula bheda pabbam) by [...] "stilling the thought-formation", [...] "removal of the (thought) source of those unskillful thoughts", [...] "appeasing the whole intentional thought process", or engaging in [...] "the relaxing of thought-fabrication". The sutta compares this to stages of removing {{the source of}} physical movement: Just as a man walking fast might consider: 'Why am I walking fast? What if I walk slowly?' and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> walk slowly; <b>then</b> <b>he</b> might consider: 'Why am I walking slowly? What if I stand?' and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> stand; <b>then</b> <b>he</b> might consider: 'Why am I standing? What if I sit?' and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> sit; <b>then</b> <b>he</b> might consider: 'Why am I sitting? What if I lie down?' and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> lie down. By doing so <b>he</b> <b>would</b> substitute for each grosser posture one that was subtler. So too...when a bhikkhu gives attention to stilling the thought-formation of those thoughts...his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to singleness, and concentrated.|$|R
5|$|The King's Champion {{would then}} throw down the gauntlet; the {{ceremony}} would be repeated at {{the centre of}} the hall and at the High Table (where the sovereign would be seated). The sovereign would then drink to the champion from a gold cup, which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>then</b> present to the latter. This ritual was dropped from the coronation of Queen Victoria and was never revived. The offices of Chief Butler of England, Grand Carver of England and Master Carver of Scotland were also associated with the coronation banquet.|$|E
5|$|In New Orleans, a {{homeless}} veteran named Douglas Binder (Chuck Pfarrer) {{is the target}} of a hunt. He is given a belt containing $10,000 and told that he must reach {{the other side of town}} where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>then</b> win the money and his life. Pursuing him is the hunt organizer Emil Fouchon (Lance Henriksen), his lieutenant Pik Van Cleef (Arnold Vosloo), a businessman named Mr. Lopaki who has paid $500,000 for the opportunity to hunt a human, and mercenaries including Stephan (Sven-Ole Thorsen) and Peterson (Jules Sylvester). Binder fails to reach his destination and is shot by three crossbow bolts. Van Cleef retrieves the money belt.|$|E
5|$|In the evenings, {{he coached}} the University of Toronto varsity team. It was through his {{coaching}} {{of this team}} that he {{became involved in the}} NHL. The team traveled regularly to the Boston area for games against colleges from that area, with great success. In 1926, Boston Bruins owner Charles Adams recommended him to Col. John S. Hammond, representing the owners of the new New York Rangers franchise, who was looking for someone to build his team. Smythe was hired to recruit a team, which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>then</b> manage. But on October 27, 1926, before the Rangers had played a regular season game, Hammond fired Smythe in favour of Lester Patrick. Smythe believed that he lost his job by refusing to sign two-time NHL scoring champion Babe Dye, against Hammond's wishes. Smythe thought Dye was not a team player.|$|E

60|$|And so, in a fashion, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> escape death. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> die, but <b>then,</b> after {{a period}} of months, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> live again, briefly, for an afternoon.|$|R

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the Beirut law school's {{curriculum}} before the 5th century. The Scholia Sinaitica and the Scholia to the Basilica provide glimpses of the school's teaching method, comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze juridic texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as Ulpian. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>then</b> formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} smaller textile {{concerns}} in the parish. Thomas Howarth owned a cottage in Stand Lane from where he sent yarn to be dyed and sized. He made his own warps which were weaved in the town. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>then</b> travel to Preston and Kendal where drapers would purchase his products. His nephews founded A. & J. Hoyle's Mill in Irwell Street, which employed power weaving to produce their specialities in Ginghams and shirting. The mill closed in 1968. Messrs Stott & Pickstone's Top Shop on Stand Lane was the first company to employ powered looms and spinning around 1844. Many of their employees would eventually leave {{to start their own}} businesses, such as Spider Mill, built by Robert and William Fletcher, and John Pickstone. This mill closed around 1930.|$|E
5|$|After GoldenEye 007 was released, Rare began {{development}} of a spiritual successor titled Perfect Dark. Using an upgraded version of the GoldenEye 007 game engine, Perfect Dark was released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64. Although the game features a setting and storyline unrelated to James Bond, it shares many gameplay features, including a similar control scheme, mission objectives that vary with the difficulty setting, and cheat options unlockable through quick level completions. While Perfect Dark was still in development, Martin Hollis left Rare {{to work as a}} consultant {{on the development of the}} GameCube at Nintendo of America. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>then</b> form his own company, Zoonami, in 2000. Other members of the GoldenEye 007 team also left Rare to form Free Radical Design. The company would develop the TimeSplitters first-person shooters for the PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox. These games contain several references to GoldenEye 007, including the design of the health-HUD, the nature of the aiming system, and the dam setting of the opening level of TimeSplitters 2.|$|E
50|$|Hastings {{writing was}} infused with both clarity and wit. Complex ideas became simple. Historical, biblical, and {{cultural}} references were frequent. He {{got interested in}} many things over a lifetime. Where his interest led, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> learn, <b>then</b> write, and then move on.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must come}} down and see my nags, Mark; they came to-day. The Merediths will be off at twelve, {{and then we can}} have an hour together." [...] Mark said <b>he</b> <b>would,</b> and <b>then</b> went home with his wife under his arm.|$|R
60|$|Phineas {{said that}} <b>he</b> <b>would,</b> and <b>then</b> went on, not knowing {{exactly where he}} was going. He had one desire,--to find Violet Effingham, but when he should find her he could not carry her off, and sit with her beneath a haycock.|$|R
5|$|In English law, secret trusts are a {{class of}} trust defined as an {{arrangement}} between a testator and a trustee, made to come into force after death, that aims to benefit a person without having been written in a formal will. The property {{is given to the}} trustee in the will, and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>then</b> be expected to pass it on to the real beneficiary. For these to be valid, the person seeking to enforce the trust must prove that the testator intended to form a trust, that this intention was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee accepted his office. There are two types of secret trust — fully secret and half-secret. A fully secret trust is one with no mention in the will whatsoever. In the case of a half-secret trust, the face of the will names the trustee as trustee, but does not give the trust's terms, including the beneficiary. The most important difference lies in communication of the trust: the terms of a half-secret trust must be communicated to the trustee before the execution of the will, whereas {{in the case of a}} fully secret trust the terms may be communicated after the execution of the will, as long as this is before the testator's death.|$|E
5|$|Kanye West {{began working}} on Graduation {{immediately}} after releasing his second studio album Late Registration. By late September 2005, West had already completed three songs for the album, which he intended to contain a total of twelve tracks. Around {{the time of the}} recording of the third studio album, West would often listen to songs written by folk and country singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash in hopes of developing methods to augment his word play and storytelling abilities. The former musician had been recommended to West by multiple of his friends, including English disc jockey Samantha Ronson, all of whom claimed his music and the way he dealt with the press reminded them of Dylan. Kanye also listened to his most favorite alternative rock bands, including The Killers, Radiohead, Modest Mouse, and Keane, in order to gain new ideas on how to make his hip-hop production style more stadium-friendly. Additionally, West would often test his new songs on his iPod, in his office, in dance clubs and just about anywhere people might listen to his music. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>then</b> make adjustments to the tracks based on feedback he received, repeating the process as many times as necessary.|$|E
5|$|Though the Halifax {{area was}} settled by aboriginals, {{particularly}} the Mi'kmaq people, {{as early as}} 7000 BC, there is no archaeological evidence of native habitation on Melville Island prior {{to the arrival of}} the Europeans. The first Europeans to reach the land were likely French traders and missionaries in the 17th century. Halifax was founded by the British in 1749. The first documented use of Melville Island was by Robert Cowie and John Aubony, who obtained a Crown grant in 1752 to allow them to build a storehouse. After Cowie's death in 1781, John Butler Kelly purchased what was then known as Cowie's Island and quickly resold it in 1784 to James Kavanagh, the head of a prosperous family fishery, for £65. Kavanagh used the land, known as Kavanagh's Island according to the then-prevalent tradition of place naming, to dry and store fish that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>then</b> sell from his Halifax store.|$|E
50|$|Beckeles {{started his}} career at {{hometown}} club Vida for whom <b>he</b> <b>would</b> make his professional debut and whom <b>he</b> <b>would</b> captain. <b>He</b> <b>then</b> joined giants Olimpia in 2011.|$|R

25|$|According to Pinochet, who {{was aware}} of his ancestry, he was taught the French {{language}} by an uncle. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>then</b> have forgotten most of it. Pinochet admired Napoleon as the greatest among French and had a framed picture of him. Another French ruler he admired was Louis XIV.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon's {{strategy}} was to isolate the Allied and Prussian armies, and annihilate each one separately before the Austrians and Russians arrived. In doing so the vast superiority in numbers of the Coalition would be greatly diminished. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>then</b> seek {{the possibility of a}} peace with Austria and Russia.|$|E
