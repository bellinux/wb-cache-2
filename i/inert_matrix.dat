50|$|The {{operating}} temperature should {{not exceed the}} melting temperature of the fuel. Fuel-to-cladding chemical interaction (FCCI) has to be designed against. FCCI is eutectic melting between the fuel and the cladding; uranium, plutonium, and lanthanum (a fission product) inter-diffuse with the iron of the cladding. The alloy that forms has a low eutectic melting temperature. FCCI causes the cladding to reduce in strength and could eventually rupture. The amount of transuranic transmutation {{is limited by the}} production of plutonium from uranium. A design work-around has been proposed to have an <b>inert</b> <b>matrix.</b> Magnesium oxide has been proposed as the <b>inert</b> <b>matrix.</b> Magnesium oxide has an entire order of magnitude smaller probability of interacting with neutrons (thermal and fast) than elements like iron.The SFR is designed for management of high-level wastes and, in particular, management of plutonium and other actinides. Important safety features of the system include a long thermal response time, a large margin to coolant boiling, a primary system that operates near atmospheric pressure, and intermediate sodium system between the radioactive sodium in the primary system and the water and steam in the power plant. With innovations to reduce capital cost, such as making a modular design, removing a primary loop, integrating the pump and intermediate heat exchanger, or simply find better materials for construction, the SFR can be a viable technology for electricity generation.|$|E

50|$|Fissile nuclei, like Uranium-235, Plutonium-239 and Uranium-233 {{respond well}} to delayed {{neutrons}} and are thus important to keep a critical reactor stable, and this limits the amount of minor actinides that can be destroyed in a critical reactor.

In contrast, the power output of a sub-critical reactor is limited by the intensity of the driving particle accelerator, and thus it need not contain any uranium or plutonium at all.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{long-term}} radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel, many studies are performed on partitioning and transmutation of actinides. In such a scenario, the long-lived radio-isotopes (mostly actinides) are partitioned from the nuclear waste, and subsequently transmuted or fissioned in a neutron flux in shorter-lived or stable isotopes. In order to place the actinides in a neutron flux, they must be embedded material that behaves inert under neutron irradiation, a so-called <b>inert</b> <b>matrix</b> material. As most actinides decay by emitting a a-particle, large quantities of helium will be build up in the <b>inert</b> <b>matrix</b> material, before, during and after neutron irradiation. The behaviour of the helium in the material gives information whether or not a material could be used as an <b>inert</b> <b>matrix.</b> In the thesis, the behaviour of helium in two candidate <b>inert</b> <b>matrix</b> materials has been studied: magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl 2 O 4) and zirconia (ZrO 2) fully stabilised with yttria (Y 2 O 3). In most cases, a known quantity of helium has been implanted in the material and various investigation techniques were applied to see at which temperatures helium is released from the specimen and how the damage, introduced by the ion-implantation recovers.
