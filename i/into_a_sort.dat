5|$|Despite its failure, Maslama's {{attempt to}} capture Constantinople became celebrated in later Muslim literature, with several {{surviving}} accounts, mostly semi-fictional, {{in which the}} historical defeat was transformed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of victory: Maslama {{was said to have}} departed only after symbolically entering the Byzantine capital on his horse accompanied by thirty riders; Leo received him with honour and led him to the Hagia Sophia, where the emperor paid homage to the Arab general. The tales of the siege influenced similar episodes in Arabic epic literature, where Maslama appears associated with another legendary Arab hero of the wars against Byzantium, Abdallah al-Battal. Furthermore, Byzantine tradition, as recorded in the 10th-century De Administrando Imperio, held that during the siege Maslama convinced the Byzantines to build Constantinople's first mosque, near the city's praetorium. Later Ottoman tradition also ascribed the building of the Arap Mosque (located outside Constantinople proper in Galata) to Maslama, although it erroneously dated this to around 686, probably confusing Maslama's attack with the first Arab siege in the 670s. In reality, the mosque near the praetorium was most likely erected in about 860, {{as a result of an}} Arab embassy in that year.|$|E

500|$|Gray's {{life was}} {{surrounded}} by loss and death, and many people that he knew died painfully and alone. In 1749, several events occurred that caused Gray stress. On 7 November, Mary Antrobus, Gray's aunt, died; her death devastated his family. The loss was compounded {{a few days later}} by news that his friend since childhood Horace Walpole had been almost killed by two highwaymen. Although Walpole survived and later joked about the event, the incident disrupted Gray's ability to pursue his scholarship. The events dampened the mood that Christmas, and Antrobus's death was ever fresh {{in the minds of the}} Gray family. As a side effect, the events caused Gray to spend much of his time contemplating his own mortality. As he [...] began to contemplate various aspects of mortality, he combined his desire to determine a view of order and progress present in the Classical world with aspects of his own life.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} designing a distributed algorithm that, given an arbitrary connected graph G of nodes with unique labels, converts G <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> list of nodes. This algorithm should {{be as simple as}} possible and, for scalability, should guarantee a polylogarithmic runtime as well as at most a polylogarithmic increase in the degree of each node during its execution. Furthermore, it should be selfstabilizing, that is, it should be able to eventually construct <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> list from any state in which the graph is connected. It turns out that satisfying all of these demands at the same time is not easy. Our basic approach towards this goal is the so-called linearization technique: each node v repeatedly does the following with its neighbors: • for its left (i. e., smaller) neighbors u 1, [...] ., uk in the order of decreasing labels, v replaces {v, u 1 }, [...] ., {v, uk} by {v, u 1 }, {u 1, u 2 }, [...] ., {uk− 1, uk}, and • for its right (i. e., larger) neighbors w 1, [...] ., wℓ in the order of increasing labels, v replaces {v, w 1 }, [...] ., {v, wℓ} by {v, w 1 }, {w 1, w 2 }, [...] ., {wℓ− 1, wℓ}. As shown in this paper, this technique transforms any connected graph <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>sorted</b> list, but there are graphs for which this can take a long time. Hence, we propose several extensions of the linearization technique and experimentally evaluate their performance. Our results indicate that some of these have a polylogarithmic performance, so there is hope that there are distributed algorithms that can achieve all of our goals above. ...|$|R

One of the prime movers behind the decision was the vice-principal, Lewis Gilbertson, {{as part of his}} unsuccessful attempt to move the college towards Anglo-Catholicism. The architect George Edmund Street was appointed, and had almost free rein in his work. In 1863, he said to the bursar that the chapel was [...] "so good in style considering its late date" [...] that it would be [...] "very inadvisable to alter it in any respect, save one, the old features of the walls and roofing". However, he later said that the fittings were [...] "incongruous", with the seats being [...] "so thoroughly uncomfortable that kneeling is rendered all but impossible, and sitting even is concerted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of penance". His work was completed in 1864, at a cost of £1,679 18s 10d. The arch of the chancel was widened and the memorials to Sir Eubule Thelwell and Francis Mansell, which had been {{on each side of the}} arch, were moved to the north wall of the chancel. The original Jacobean woodwork was removed, with the exception of the screen donated by Edwards and the pulpit, new seats were installed and new paving was placed in the main part of the chapel. A stone reredos was added behind the altar, although the design originally submitted by Street was not approved and he was asked to make changes. [...] The reredos as finally installed has three marble panels: a crucifixion scene (centre), Christ carrying his cross (right) and Christ on the knees of St Mary (left).
