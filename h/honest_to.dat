5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} been thought of as agnostic. Pears said that when they met in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have described himself as a Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in <b>Honest</b> <b>to</b> God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E
25|$|Aurangzeb died in 1707. Taking {{advantage}} of the weakness of Mughal rule Churaman planned to expand his state. His rise started from the battle of Jajau in 1707. After {{the war was over}} he looted both armies of Azam as well as Muazzam. Churaman showed wisdom and decided to be <b>honest</b> <b>to</b> the New Mughal ruler with a view to protect huge wealth of booty. He appeared before Bahadurshah on 15 September 1707 and presented gifts in his honour.|$|E

25|$|She is cruelly <b>honest</b> <b>to</b> Dawn and Buffy, and overpowers {{everyone}} {{with whom she}} comes in contact. When she takes Giles' magic from him, she gains the ability to feel the world's pain, becoming determined to put the world out of its misery. She does not acknowledge her grief, and only Xander can force her to face it when he tells her that he loves her no matter what or who she is, and if she is determined to end the world she must start by killing him. Only then does Willow return, sobbing.|$|E
25|$|After the Scarman Report on {{the riots}} was published, Powell {{gave a speech}} on 10 December in the Commons. Powell {{disagreed}} with Scarman {{when he said that}} the black community was alienated because it was economically disadvantaged: the black community was alienated because it was alien. He claimed tensions would worsen because the nonwhite population was growing: whereas in Lambeth it was 25%, of those of secondary school age it was 40%. Powell said that the government should be <b>honest</b> <b>to</b> the people by telling them in thirty years' time, the black population of Lambeth would have doubled in size.|$|E

She flirts {{in order to get}} people to sign up, and continues flirting at a party, with Ray Dixon (Chucky Venn), Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), Derek, Max Branning (Jake Wood) and Michael, sharing a close moment with each of them. While in the kitchen alone, an unseen man enters and he and Kat have a sexual encounter. She feels guilty the next day and attempts to neglect calls and texts from the mystery man, who has bought her a new phone.

25|$|In 1175, {{the emperor}} was seriously ill {{and decided to}} entrust the regentship of his son Lý Long Trát to Tô Hiến Thành. The regent was {{appointed}} to the position of chancellor of the Lý Dynasty (Thái phó bình chương quân quốc trọng sự) and granted the title Prince (Vương) — an unprecedented act of a Lý emperor for a title that was reserved exclusively for members of the royal family. During the Lý Dynasty, Tô Hiến Thành was the only possessor of the title Prince who did not come from the Lý royal family. From the fourth month of 1175, Tô Hiến Thành began his regency because the emperor was not able to rule the country as the crown prince was only two years old. The emperor died in the seventh month in 1175 and began the campaign of the Empress Mother in supporting another prince, Lý Long Xưởng, to replace the infant emperor Lý Long Trát, now Lý Cao Tông. The Empress Mother tried to bribe Tô Hiến Thành's wife and persuaded the regent many times. Tô Hiến Thành refused by a simple answer that he had to follow the order of the late emperor and preferred being <b>honest</b> <b>to</b> being rich but disloyal. His firmness in refusing the proposal of the Empress Mother and controlling the army and order during the funeral time made other officials believe in Lý Cao Tông. They therefore declined the campaign of replacing him by the prince Lý Long Xưởng.|$|E

In his 1969 memoires, Spaak praised Pierlot as [...] "serious to the point of severity, <b>honest</b> <b>to</b> the point of scrupulosity, a tireless worker, a devout Christian, a patriot, a model of civic, professional, and family virtues, he was an exceptional man." ...|$|E

500|$|In his youth, {{influenced}} by his uncle, former Liberal Lord Mayor of Adelaide Sir Jonathan Cain, Dunstan was {{a supporter of}} the conservative Liberal and Country League (LCL) and handed out how-to-vote cards for the party at state elections. Dunstan later said of his involvement with the Liberals: [...] "I do not call it snobbery to deride the Establishment in South Australia, I admit that I was brought up into it, and I admit that it gave me a pain." [...] When asked of his roots, he said [...] "I'm a refugee from it and thank God for somewhere <b>honest</b> <b>to</b> flee to!" ...|$|E
500|$|Eckhart {{has talked}} {{much about his}} beliefs, his way of life, and his future career ambitions.

To be <b>honest,</b> <b>to</b> be perfectly clear, I'd be a hypocrite if I did say that I was, just because I haven't lived that lifestyle for so many years." [...] In other interviews, {{he has said that}} hypnosis helped him to quit drinking, smoking, and partying, and that he undertakes amateur photography in his spare time. In an interview with Parade magazine, Eckhart revealed that before he discovered acting, he wanted to become a songwriter.|$|E
500|$|Bhardwaj {{noted that}} he {{retained}} Bond's theme, but incorporated his own elements to make the film a dark comedy. He said, [...] "I had previously taken liberties with Shakespeare. Naturally, when you adapt a story, your vision also comes in it. But I have remained <b>honest</b> <b>to</b> its essence". He included Keemat Lal (who plays {{a police officer in}} all Bond's stories), although the character is not in the original story. Bhardwaj decided to include him in the film as an homage to Bond, explaining that he took liberties with characters' names and traits. Bond also had to devise Indian methods of killing the husbands, which he found challenging: [...] "The challenge was devising seven ingenious ways in which she could kill her husbands without being suspected. And she does it successfully, until towards the end".|$|E

500|$|McCartney {{admitted}} that they had always signed all the contracts that Epstein presented to them without reading them first, but after Epstein's death, Lennon complained, [...] "Well, he was alright. I've found out since, of course, that he wasn't quite as <b>honest</b> <b>to</b> us as he made out." [...] Despite this, other interviews with Lennon report him as being loyal to Epstein's memory: [...] "We had complete faith in {{him when he was}} running us. To us, he was the expert". When asked in 1964 about his standing as a manager or businessman, Epstein replied, [...] "Fair, as a businessman, fair. I've got a business background, and probably a reasonable business brain. I'm no, sort of, genius [...]" [...] Asked about his deficiencies, Epstein replied, [...] "I'm probably too conscious of ideas, rather than finance behind ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|New York Times public editor (ombudsman) Elizabeth Spayd {{wrote in}} 2016 that [...] "Conservatives and even many moderates, see in The Times a blue-state worldview" [...] and accuse it of {{harboring}} a liberal bias. Spayd did not analyze {{the substance of}} the claim, but did opine that the Times is [...] "part of a fracturing media environment that reflects a fractured country. That in turn leads liberals and conservatives toward separate news sources." [...] Times executive editor Dean Baquet stated that he does not believe coverage has a liberal bias, but that: [...] "We have to be really careful that people feel like they can see themselves in The New York Times. I want us to be perceived as fair and <b>honest</b> <b>to</b> the world, not just a segment of it. It's a really difficult goal. Do we pull it off all the time? No." ...|$|E
500|$|The Australian press {{were shocked}} and criticised the hostility of Larwood in particular. Some former Australian players joined the criticism, saying the tactics were {{ethically}} wrong. But at this stage, not everyone was opposed, and the Australian Board of Control believed the English team had bowled fairly. On the other hand, Jardine increasingly came into disagreement with tour manager Warner over bodyline as the tour progressed. Warner hated bodyline {{but would not}} speak out against it. He was accused of hypocrisy for not taking a stand on either side, particularly after expressing sentiments {{at the start of}} the tour that cricket [...] "has become a synonym for all that is true and <b>honest.</b> <b>To</b> say 'that is not cricket' implies something underhand, something not in keeping with the best ideals...all who love it as players, as officials or spectators must be careful lest anything they do should do it harm." ...|$|E

500|$|At the café, Sam {{introduces}} his fiancée Sheila (Téa Leoni) to Frasier. After short conversation, Frasier {{realizes that}} Sheila {{is the woman}} with whom he slept three months ago. Then Frasier goes to the hotel room, at where she and Sam are staying. Sheila explains that {{she is also a}} sex addict, like Sam, and that Sam and she {{met for the first time}} at one of group meetings of sexual addicts. Frasier begs her not to tell Sam about their short-time affair. Suddenly, Sam arrives into the room and then, in order to be <b>honest</b> <b>to</b> her, confesses to Sheila that, at the day of their engagement, Sam slept with another woman twice. Then Sheila confesses that she slept with other two regular patrons: Paul ("short, bald, fat") and then Cliff Clavin. Though he forgives her dalliance with Paul, Sam is disgusted to learn about Cliff and breaks off his relationship with Sheila. (When she turns to Frasier for help, he is equally disgusted about Cliff.) ...|$|E
500|$|Cleave's {{interview}} with Lennon {{was published in}} the Evening Standard in March 1966 and provoked no public reaction in the UK. Church attendance there was in decline and the Christian churches were making no secret of the need to transform their image into something more relevant to modern times. Music historian Jonathan Gould wrote, [...] "The satire comedians had had a field day with the increasingly desperate attempts of the Church to make itself seem more relevant ('Don't call me vicar, call me Dick...')." [...] In 1963, the Anglican Bishop of Woolwich, John A.T. Robinson, published a controversial but popular book, <b>Honest</b> <b>to</b> God, urging the nation to reject traditional church teachings on morality and the concept of God as an [...] "old man in the sky", and instead embrace a universal ethic of love. Bryan R. Wilson's 1966 text Religion in Secular Society explained that increasing secularisation led to British churches being abandoned. However, in the US, churches remained popular.|$|E
500|$|The {{first full}} {{screenplay}} {{for the film}} was written by [...] writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris, who received full screenplay credit. Paul Haggis rewrote Brancato and Ferris's script, and Shawn Ryan made another revision three weeks before filming. Jonathan Nolan also wrote on set, which led to McG to say, [...] "I would have to characterize Jonah as the lead writer of the film." [...] In response {{to whether or not}} Nolan would receive a writing credit for his contribution, McG went on to say, [...] "I don’t know how the WGA rules work, but <b>honest</b> <b>to</b> goodness, we did the heaviest lifting with Jonah.” Nolan contributed to the film after Bale signed on and created Connor's arc of becoming a leader. Anthony E. Zuiker contributed to the script as well. So extensive were the rewrites that Alan Dean Foster decided to rewrite the entire novelization after submitting it to his publisher because the compiled shooting script was very different from the one he was given beforehand.|$|E
