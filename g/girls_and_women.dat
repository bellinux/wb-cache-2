5|$|Madonna's {{look and}} style of dressing, her performances, and her music videos {{influenced}} young <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> Her style {{became one of the}} female fashion trends of the 1980s. Created by stylist and jewelry designer Maripol, the look consisted of lace tops, skirts over capri pants, fishnet stockings, jewelry bearing the crucifix, bracelets, and bleached hair. Madonna's popularity continued to rise globally with the release of her second studio album, Like a Virgin, in November 1984. It became her first number-one album in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, the UK, and the US. Like a Virgin was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America and sold more than 21 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{real issue}} is that it moves the moral center more towards the obscene. That it becomes more normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that is loaded with innuendo, and that is seen as normal, even preferred... if <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> find their {{identity}} and self-worth in the approval of people, they will {{do whatever it takes}} to become popular and loved. When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls tend to think that is the way for them to be valuable. God tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth Cresswell (c. 1625– c. 1698), {{also known}} as Mother Creswell and Madam Cresswell of Clerkenwell, {{was one of the}} most {{successful}} prostitutes and brothel keepers of the English seventeenth century. Starting with houses in Bartholomew Close, in the City of London and St Leonard's, Shoreditch, she built a widespread network of brothels across London, supplied with <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> from across England. Her employees included the wives of soldiers pressed into service for Charles II and gentlewomen who had supported the Cavalier cause during the English Civil War and had since fallen on hard times. Her bawdy houses were favoured by King Charles and his court as well as powerful figures in government and city guilds. This position gave her a measure of immunity from prosecution and added to her profile as a caricature of iniquity and corruption.|$|E
5|$|Such {{treatment}} of the Christians for refusals by the girls is also confirmed in the accounts of British officer James Scurry, who was held captive along with the Mangalorean Catholics. In his book The Captivity, Sufferings, and Escape of James Scurry, who was Detained a Prisoner During Ten Years, in the Dominions of Hyder Ali and Tippoo Saib (1824), Scurry also reports that Tipu relented on his demand for captive girls, after one captive fell from her beast and expired on the spot through loss of blood. About 200 young women, the prettiest and fairest, were selected for Tipu's seraglio. The rest {{of the women were}} distributed as wives to Muslim officers and favourites living there. The future Christian progeny of these young <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> were lost, and their descendants are fully Islamic as of today.|$|E
5|$|The typical Han-era Chinese {{household}} {{contained a}} nuclear family {{with an average}} of four to five members, unlike in later dynasties when multiple generations and extended family members commonly lived in the same household. Families were patrilineal, which made the father the supreme head of the house. Arranged marriages were the norm, while a new wife was expected to join the clan of her husband. Having sons over daughters was considered extremely important for the sake of carrying on ancestor worship. Although <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> were expected by custom and Confucian tradition to behave passively towards their male relatives, mothers were given a familial status above that of their sons. Women also engaged in various professions in and outside of the home and were given protection under the law. The empress was superior in status to the male relatives of her consort clan, while the mother of the emperor—the empress dowager—had the authority to override his decisions and choose his successor (if one had not been appointed before his death).|$|E

5|$|After his stint {{with the}} Conquistadors, Chamberlain {{successfully}} went into business and entertainment, made money {{in stocks and}} real estate, bought a popular Harlem nightclub, which he renamed Big Wilt's Smalls Paradise, and invested in broodmares. Chamberlain also sponsored his personal professional volleyball and track and field teams, and also provided high-level teams for <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> in basketball, track, volleyball and softball, and made money by appearing in ads for TWA, American Express, Volkswagen, Drexel Burnham, Le Tigre Clothing and Foot Locker. After his basketball career, volleyball became Chamberlain's new passion: being a talented hobby volleyballer during his Lakers days, he became {{board member of the}} newly founded International Volleyball Association in 1974 and became its president one year later. As a testament to his importance, the IVA All-Star game was televised only because Chamberlain also played in it: he rose to the challenge and was named the game's MVP. He played occasional matches for the IVA Seattle Smashers before the league folded in 1979. Chamberlain promoted the sport so effectively that he was named to the Volleyball Hall of Fame: {{he became one of the}} few athletes who were enshrined in different sports.|$|E
5|$|The Docks {{had been}} {{gradually}} declining from the 18th century; the larger ships being built found The Thames difficult to navigate, and Deptford was under {{competition from the}} new docks at Plymouth, Portsmouth and Chatham. When the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815 {{the need for a}} Docks to build and repair warships declined; the Docks shifted from shipbuilding to concentrate on victualling at the Royal Victoria Victualling Yard, and the Royal Dock closed in 1869. From 1871 until the First World War the shipyard site was the City of London Corporation's Foreign Cattle Market, in which <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> butchered sheep and cattle until {{the early part of the}} 20th century. At its peak, around 1907, over 234,000 animals were imported annually through the market, but by 1912 these figures had declined to less than 40,000 a year. The yard was taken over by the War Office in 1914, and was an Army Supply Reserve Depot in the First and Second World Wars. The site lay unused until being purchased by Convoys (newsprint importers) in 1984, and eventually came into the ownership of News International. In the mid-1990s, although significant investment was made on the site, it became uneconomic to continue using it as a freight wharf. In 2008 Hutchison Whampoa bought the 16ha site from News International with plans for a £700m 3,500-home development scheme. The Grade II listed Olympia Warehouse will be refurbished as part of the redevelopment of the site.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{received}} {{numerous awards}} and honours during her long career. In 1984, {{she became the}} first woman at the University of Toronto to be named University Professor, a special title which is the highest honour given by the university. She was named Officer of the Order of Canada in 1981 and a Companion of the Order in 1992. She was appointed to the Order of Ontario in 1990.

Recognising the increasing importance of schools as {{the primary source of}} support for <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> young <b>women,</b> the chapters discuss the implications for practice of teachers and other professionals, covering important issues like: - girls' classroom behaviour; - mental health problems; - violence and sexuality; - exclusion and community offences. By presenting a range of theoretical perspectives, readers of this book will be encouraged to reflect on what underpins the actions of <b>girls</b> <b>and</b> young <b>women</b> <b>and</b> take their voices seriously.
