40|$|We {{construct}} a search-theoretic model � la Lagos and Wright (2005), that has multiple steady-state equilibria, {{one of which}} may be interpreted as a state of financial crisis. The key ingredient is the collateral-secured loan in the decentralized matching market, in which the borrowers must put up their own land as collateral. They borrow debt for intertemporal smoothing of the consumption stream and also for <b>factor</b> <b>payment</b> in production. In the crisis state, the land price is low and the debt for <b>factor</b> <b>payment,</b> i. e., liquidity, dries up. Facing a liquidity shortage, all sellers choose not to participate in the matching market and the market is shut down due to the search externality. This market disruption lowers the aggregate productivity, while the low productivity justifies the low asset price in turn. We may be able to derive a policy implication that collective debt reduction by government intervention may solve the coordination failure and bring the economy out of the crisis equilibrium. ...|$|R

50|$|Let {{one study}} {{with the help of}} {{circular}} flow of income how flow of goods and services between households and firms is balanced by flow of <b>factor</b> <b>payments</b> made in exchange of them. Consider the circular flow of income in a two-sector economy where there is no government, no capital market, and no foreign sector. Households own all the factors of production: land, labor, capital. These factors of production are sold to the firms to produce goods and services through factor markets. Firms make use of these resources and provide goods and services to the household through product markets. However the exchange of goods and services and factors of production takes place {{with the help of the}} financial flows that move in the reverse direction. As the households purchase goods and services from firms it is their consumption expenditure which in turn becomes income or profits for the firms. On the other hand, when firms buy factors of production from the households they pay <b>factor</b> <b>payments</b> in the form of wages, rent, interest.|$|E

40|$|The {{processes}} which {{determine the}} economic growth and development of subnational geographic units {{continue to be a}} major focus of research in the field of regional economics. To date, research efforts in regional growth have fallen into four main categories: regional econometric model building, the shift-share/export-base approach (which is fundamentally industrial structure analysis), growth-pole agglomeration studies, and neoclassical growth theory, which emphasizes the movement of productive factors in search of increasing returns. ^ The principal focus of this research is on neoclassical growth theory. In particular, a supply oriented, neoclassical model is constructed along lines first suggested by George Borts in his seminal 1960 study of aggregate manufacturing growth. This model proposes a relationship between the rate of growth of returns to factors of production in a given region and the initial level of <b>factor</b> <b>payments.</b> According to the model, factor returns should be observed to be growing faster in regions where they were initially lowest, and growing more slowly in regions where they were initially relatively higher. The implication for regional growth research is that factors of production, such as capital and labor, will tend to migrate in search of higher returns allowing regional economists to anticipate the direction and magnitude of factor movements. ^ The present research is an extension of the Borts line of inquiry, but using more highly disaggregated three-digit industry data. To this end, a series of hypotheses, similar to those suggested by Borts, are derived and tested based on the neoclassical model. A sample of eighteen three-digit industries are examined with respect to each hypothesis, and results are reported. The results suggest several specific conclusions regarding the process of regional economic growth: first, that returns to factors of production have a predictable and demonstrable relation to their relative intensities in a given industry; second, that <b>factor</b> <b>payments</b> tend to grow faster in areas where they were initially low, and slower where they were initially high, and third, that <b>factor</b> <b>payments</b> appear to exhibit a pattern of spatial convergence among regions within the population of industries studied. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{imposition}} of water quality controls {{may affect the}} economy chiefly by altering aggregate production and changing the <b>factor</b> <b>payments,</b> These two effects could not only reallocate resources among production possibilities, but also could change the distribution of benefits of production {{among members of the}} society. This study attempted to provide a workable theory to establish an empirical test of the impacts of water quality controls on family income distribution. It consists of two separate areas: first, to analyze methodologies of measuring income distribution changes, and, second, to develop a theoretical model that is useful for empirical tests of the impacts of different water quality controls. A number of alternative probability density functions have been proposed as models of personal income distribution. The lognormal, displaced lognormal, gamma, and beta distribution functions were considered as appropriate methodologies, since each allows more productive power for income distribution as suggested in the past literature. Detailed information on income distribution can be extracted from the approximations of the distribution functions. One of the objectives of the research was to evaluate the different methodologies for usefulness. The gastwirth bounds for Gini coefficient were used as the test of goodness to fit; the beta density was clearly superior to the other densities for the SMSA data. Next, a theoretical model was constructed, emphasizing the production sector and the distribution sector. Water quality controls were introduced in the production process as a negative input. Water quality data were collected for all states, and indices of quality were estimated using analysis of variance techniques. The equilibrium conditions in commodity and factor markets generated the first impacts of water quality controls on total output and <b>factor</b> <b>payments</b> in the economy. The specific assumption was made as a theoretical bridge connecting family income distribution and <b>factor</b> <b>payments</b> in the distribution sector. It was assumed that a family 2 ̆ 7 s income equals total payments received from owned labor and capital in the production process. Thus, changes in <b>factor</b> <b>payments</b> and total output were included in the distribution equations. Water quality controls would, therefore, effect family income distribution through changes in total output and changes in factor payment. The simultaneous equation regression results for 72 SMSA 2 ̆ 7 s were not conclusive. It appeared that water quality parameter may effect the wage rate and total output, if the parameter was not, in fact, a surrogate for other excluded variables in the system. The effect of wage changes on income distribution was not significant, but changes in total output appeared to be the most significant variable in the distribution equations. In an attempt to account for the many variables which might be expected to effect income distribution, factor analysis was performed on the SMSA 2 ̆ 7 s. Two groups of SMSA 2 ̆ 7 s were identified and regressions were performed for these groups. Results from these regressions were similar in sign to the results from the 172 observations regressions, although many of the coefficients were not significant. Interpreting the results of the research was somewhat difficult, even though some results did appear consistent among all regressions. It does appear that there is some evidence to indicate that water quality controls lead to less equal family income distribution. Better data are required from more complete and accurate analysis. The principle thrust {{of the study was to}} develop a model to organize the complexity of economic causality with respect to income distribution change and water quality policy. It appeared that this type of systematic econometric approach can be fruitful in analyzing income distribution change...|$|E
