5|$|Following {{a report}} by George Ivatt in 1945, smoke {{deflectors}} were introduced due to drifting smoke obscuring the crew's <b>forward</b> <b>vision.</b> The first locomotive to be fitted with smoke deflectors from the outset was No. 6253 City of St. Albans in September 1946. All the following four locomotives included this feature. The first unstreamlined locomotive to be retrofitted was No. 6232 Duchess of Montrose in February 1945.|$|E
5|$|The second {{batch of}} ten new-build U class {{locomotives}} was constructed between February and May 1931 when more obsolete locomotives were withdrawn from service. This brought {{the total of}} new-build locomotives to 30, and {{the total number of}} operational U class engines to 50. The new batch also featured detail differences {{from the rest of the}} class, such as the arrangement of the footsteps at the front of the locomotive, though continued to use the standard left-hand drive cab layout to improve the driver’s <b>forward</b> <b>vision</b> from the cab. Smoke deflectors were fitted to the whole class from 1933 to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring <b>forward</b> <b>vision.</b> The smokebox snifting valves applied to the class by Maunsell were removed by his successor Oliver Bulleid, who also fitted U1 class chimneys to improve the draughting.|$|E
5|$|The {{fuselage}} contained {{two major}} bulkheads, with the cockpit {{at the front}} of the first bulkhead. The nose was fitted with a rotating machine gun mount, offset to allow the pilot a better field of <b>forward</b> <b>vision.</b> The cockpit was fully glazed, with the exception of the lower right section, which acted as a platform for the bombardier-gunner. The commonly-used Lotfernrohr-series bombsight penetrated through the cockpit floor into a protective housing on the external side of the cockpit.|$|E

5|$|A {{key feature}} of the F-16's cockpit is the {{exceptional}} field of view. The single-piece, bird-proof polycarbonate bubble canopy provides 360° all-round visibility, with a 40° look-down angle {{over the side of}} the aircraft, and 15° down over the nose (compared to the common 12–13° of preceding aircraft); the pilot's seat is elevated for this purpose. Furthermore, the F-16's canopy lacks the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's <b>forward</b> <b>vision.</b> The F-16's ACES II zero/zero ejection seat is reclined at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30°; most fighters have a tilted seat at 13–15°. The tilted seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases G-force tolerance; however it has been associated with reports of neck ache, possibly caused by incorrect head-rest usage. Subsequent U.S. fighters have adopted more modest tilt-back angles of 20°. Due to the seat angle and the canopy's thickness, the ejection seat lacks canopy-breakers for emergency egress; instead the entire canopy is jettisoned prior to the seat's rocket firing.|$|E
25|$|The system {{shown on}} mockups used two large oval {{windows on the}} cockpit sides, and a periscope system {{projecting}} an image onto a fresnel lens arrangement {{directly in front of}} the pilot. In 1955, the periscope concept was tested on a modified F-84G, which was flown on a long, cross-country flight with the pilot's <b>forward</b> <b>vision</b> blocked.|$|E
25|$|Aerodynamic {{cleanliness}} was {{sacrificed to}} fields of fire for its eight machine guns. The sturdy structure {{was able to}} carry a heavy load of ammunition along with about 2,200lb (998kg) of armor plate. The result was an angular machine of wire-braced wooden construction with plywood and fabric covering. A rectangular-section fuselage carried the forward gunner in an open nose position, the pilot in a semi-enclosed cockpit with armored shutters for <b>forward</b> <b>vision,</b> and the rear gunner in an open dorsal position. The engines were carried in mid-wing nacelles.|$|E

That he was watching his own career with deeper and deeper interest, that he continually 'heard his days before him,' and cared to hear little else, might have been hazarded from what was seen there. His ambitions were, in truth, passionate, yet controlled; so that the germs of many more plans than ever blossomed to maturity had place in him; and <b>forward</b> <b>visions</b> were kept purposely in twilight, to avoid distraction.|$|R

25|$|The Delta 2 {{featured}} a cylindrical cross-section fuselage, {{the diameter of}} which having been specifically dimensioned for the Avon engine, which smoothly flowed into a lengthy tapered nose. The long nose which would normally have obscured the pilot's <b>forward</b> <b>vision</b> during landing, take-off and movement on the ground; however, the Delta 2 could compensate for this, providing adequate visibility via the innovation of a droop-nose; accordingly, the nose section and cockpit could be drooped 10° via a hydraulically-actuated mechanism, {{in a similar manner}} to that which was used later on Concorde.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, the Fairchild Aircraft Company {{undertook}} {{a study of}} new designs based on their Model 71. A decision to mount a parasol wing above the fuselage coupled with a rear cockpit position, clearly distinguished this model {{from the rest of}} the Fairchild 71 series, although the company designation maintained the family lineage. The choice of the unusual cockpit was predicated on the need to have a large front cargo compartment as well as considering the load distribution in normal operation. In use, pilots found that <b>forward</b> <b>vision</b> was compromised to such an extent that few operators favoured the installation and when the Royal Canadian Air Force ordered the type, the specifications included a new cockpit position directly behind the engine.|$|E
25|$|Promoted to {{squadron}} leader on 1 January 1980, Stirrup was {{serving as a}} flight commander on No. 226 Operational Conversion Unit which was based at RAF Lossiemouth in March 1983: his duties centred around the instruction of trainee pilots on the SEPECAT Jaguar and, on 7 March 1983, Stirrup was carrying out a student progress check from the rear seat of his aircraft when they suffered a serious bird strike. Stirrup was unable to ascertain whether his student was conscious and <b>forward</b> <b>vision</b> through the canopy was obscured: one of his engines caught fire, and although ejecting from the aircraft would have been justified, not knowing whether the student was conscious or not, Stirrup managed to land at RAF Leuchars. Stirrup was later awarded the Air Force Cross in recognition of {{his handling of the}} incident.|$|E

25|$|Further {{changes were}} made to the design, as No. A890 {{featured}} right-hand drive, impeding <b>forward</b> <b>vision</b> for viewing signals from the footplate. The main batch was produced with left-hand drive to resolve this problem. The main batch could also be distinguished by their higher running plates along the sides of the boiler, compared to the lower version on the rebuild that required larger wheel splashers to cover the tops of the driving wheels. The main batch had also dispensed with the N class/Midland Railway-style double spectacle plates (the small windows on the front face of the cab) that was retained on the prototype, replacing them with one each side of the boiler. The production locomotives also had a flatter top to the dome covers than that seen on the rebuild. The cabside cutaways for driver visibility were also cut into the roof of A890, an arrangement reminiscent of the 2-cylinder U class rebuilds of K class locomotives.|$|E
25|$|The Type 62 light {{tank was}} {{designed}} to be a downscaled Type 59 main battle tank, armed with a smaller 85mm Type 62-85TC rifled main gun and with a much simpler gunner sight and thinner armour in order to reduce overall weight. As such it has a typical tank layout: steering compartment at the front, fighting compartment in the centre and the engine compartment in the back. Although the Type 62 light tank is similar to the Type 59 main battle tank in appearance, it has a smaller hull and turret. The Type 62 light tank was given a four-man crew configuration, with the driver seated on the left hand side of the front of the hull, the tank commander and gunner seated {{on the left side of}} the turret in a tandem formation and the loader on the right hand side of the rear of the turret. The driver's hatch is located on the left hand side of the front of the hull, directly in front of the turret. It has three periscope vision blocks which provide the driver with <b>forward</b> <b>vision.</b> The centre vision block may be removed and replaced with a low-light periscope with a 50 m vision range. The left hand side turret hatch also has a periscope vision block on top of it and is most probably used by the commander. There is another periscope vision block in the front of each turret hatch. Apart from his usual duty of reloading the gun after it has been fired by the gunner, the loader is also responsible for operating the 12.7mm Type 54 anti-aircraft heavy machine gun mounted on the turret's roof.|$|E
25|$|At Lindbergh's request, {{the large}} main and forward fuel tanks {{were placed in}} the forward section of the fuselage, in front of the pilot, with the oil tank acting as a firewall. This {{arrangement}} improved the center of gravity and reduced the risk of the pilot being crushed to death between the main tank and the engine {{in the event of a}} crash. This design decision meant that there could be no front windshield, and that forward visibility would be limited to the side windows. This did not concern Lindbergh as he was used to flying in the rear cockpit of mail planes with mail bags in the front. When he wanted to see forward, he would slightly yaw the aircraft and look out the side. To provide some <b>forward</b> <b>vision</b> as a precaution against hitting ship masts, trees, or structures while flying at low altitude, a Ryan employee who had served in the submarine service installed a periscope which Lindbergh helped design. It is unclear whether the periscope was used during the flight. The instrument panel housed fuel pressure, oil pressure and temperature gauges, a clock, altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, bank and turn indicator, and a liquid magnetic compass. The main compass was mounted behind Lindbergh in the cockpit, and he read it using the mirror from a women's makeup case which was mounted to the ceiling using chewing gum. Lindbergh also installed a newly developed Earth Inductor Compass made by the Pioneer Instrument Company which allowed him to more accurately navigate while taking account of the magnetic declination of the earth. Lindbergh's ultimate arrival in Ireland deviated from his flight plan by just a few miles.|$|E

500|$|During its {{production}} run from March 1942 to June 1943, the Panzer IV Ausf.G went through further modifications, including another armor upgrade {{which consisted of}} a [...] face-hardened appliqué steel plate welded (later bolted) to the glacis—in total, frontal armor was now [...] thick. This decision to increase frontal armor was favorably received according to troop reports on 8 November 1942, despite technical problems of the driving system due to added weight. At this point, {{it was decided that}} 50% of Panzer IV production would be fitted with [...] thick additional armor plates. On 5 January 1943, Hitler decided that all Panzer IV should have [...] frontal armor. To simplify production, the vision ports {{on either side of the}} turret and the loader's <b>forward</b> <b>vision</b> port in the turret front were removed, while a rack for two spare road wheels was installed on the track guard on the left side of the hull. Complementing this, brackets for seven spare track links were added to the glacis plate.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} all this and the {{introduction}} of more recent Pacifics, {{in the middle of the}} 1950s Gresley types continued to have a quasi-monopoly of East Coast Main Line express passenger services, and as the Sixties approached they went through yet another series of improvements comparable to those of the 1920s. The most significant of these was the fitting of the French double Kylchap exhaust system, which was entirely due to the persistence from 1956 of P. N. Townend, Assistant District Motive Power Superintendent at King's Cross locomotive shed. [...] These modifications greatly reduced exhaust back pressure, making the locomotives more economical and free-running, and also kept the firetubes clean, reducing turn-around time, so much so that they were able to fit into the more intensive diesel locomotive workings. The Kylchap arrangement was already being universally applied to the A4 streamlined Pacifics, though with the non-streamlined A3 locomotives, the soft exhaust would cause the smoke and steam to drift into the driver's <b>forward</b> <b>vision.</b> The solution came in the form of narrow German-style smoke deflectors, which somewhat changed the appearance of the A3 locomotives in their latter days.|$|E

500|$|The MiG-1 was a low-wing {{monoplane}} with a tailwheel undercarriage {{of mixed}} construction. Due to shortages of light alloys, the rear fuselage {{was made from}} wood, but the front fuselage, from the propeller {{to the rear of}} the cockpit, was a welded steel tube truss covered by duralumin. The bulk of the wing was wooden, but the center section was all-metal with a steel I-section main spar. The wing used a Clark YH profile. It was evenly tapered with rounded tips and the outer wing panels had 5° of dihedral. All three landing gear wheels retracted hydraulically; the main units inwards into the wing center section. The cockpit was situated well aft, which seriously limited <b>forward</b> <b>vision</b> when landing and taxiing. The AM-37 engine was not yet available and the less powerful V-12 Mikulin AM-35A had to be substituted. It had six exhaust ejectors, one for each pair of cylinders, that provided some additional thrust. It drove a VISh-22Ye controllable-pitch propeller [...] in diameter. The air intakes for the supercharger were in the wing roots and the oil cooler was on the port side of the engine cowling. The radiator was underneath the cockpit. Armament included two fuselage-mounted [...] ShKAS machine guns and one [...] UBS machine gun.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{addressing}} the mobility problems {{introduced by the}} previous model, the final production version of the Panzer IV—the Ausf.J—was considered a retrograde from the Ausf.H. Born of necessity, to replace heavy losses, it was greatly simplified to speed production. The electric generator that powered the tank's turret traverse was removed, so the turret had to be rotated manually. The turret traversing mechanism was modified and fitted with a second gear which made hand-operation easier when the vehicle was on sloping terrain. On reasonably level ground, hand operation at 4 seconds to traverse to 12.5° and 29.5 seconds to traverse to 120° was achieved. The resulting space was later used for the installation of an auxiliary [...] fuel tank; road range was thereby increased to , The remaining pistol and vision ports on the turret side hatches were removed, and the engine's radiator housing was simplified by changing the slanted sides to straight sides. Three sockets with screw threads for mounting a 2-ton jib boom crane were welded on the turret roof while the hull roof was thickened from [...] to [...] In addition, the cylindrical muffler was replaced by two flame-suppressing mufflers. On June 1944 Wa Prüf 6 had decided that because bomb damage at Panzerfirma Krupp in Essen had seriously jeopardized tank production, all plates which should have been face-hardened for the Panzer IV were instead made with rolled homogeneous armour plate. By late 1944, Zimmerit was no longer being applied to German armored vehicles, and the Panzer IV's side-skirts {{had been replaced by}} wire mesh, while the gunner's <b>forward</b> <b>vision</b> port in the turret front was eliminated and the number of return rollers was reduced from four to three to further speed-up production.|$|E
