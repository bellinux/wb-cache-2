60|$|But <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> {{the dread}} {{of these days}} to pass; he saw the joy coming.

Municipal {{officials said they}} had advised the company to comply with local regulations and that rival taxi dispatch apps had obtained licenses.

2500|$|Shrewsbury was {{considered}} quite a slow scoring batsman, but C. B. Fry described his play thus: [...] "The {{idea that he}} is slow is mistaken. True, he is often half an hour without scoring; but somehow he makes up for it and is all but even with his more mobile partner. The fact is <b>he</b> <b>waits</b> <b>for</b> the ball he wants, and then secures a certain fourer. He does not waste time and energy in banging ball after ball into fieldsman's hands." ...|$|E
