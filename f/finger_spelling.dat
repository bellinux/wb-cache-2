A hybrid feature descriptor, which combines the advantages of SURF & Hu Moment Invariant methods, {{is used as a}} combined feature set to achieve a good recognition rate along with a low time complexity. To further increase the recognition rate and make the recognition system resilient to view-point variations, the concept of derived features from the available feature set is introduced. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for hybrid classification of single signed letter. In addition, <b>finger</b> <b>spelled</b> word recognition using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for a lexicon based approach is also proposed in this paper.

50|$|Sign {{language}} {{is the most}} important instrument for communication between deaf people and the Deaf culture. Using sign language deaf people can join social networks, local and globally, which join the Deaf culture together. Sign Language is a loose term for people that are deaf or hard of hearing and use signs to communicate. American Sign Language (ASL) is most closely related to the older form of French Sign Language, as Laurent Clerc, who was deaf and a teacher, was brought to the America's by Thomas Hopkins Gaulladet. Though Clerc brought French Sign Language, there was already sign language being used. Martha's Vineyard had more than average deaf people who had created their own Sign Language. The French Sign Language and the Sign Language that was already in use, became American Sign Language. Deaf and Hard of Hearing communities are closely drawn together due to their culture and use of Sign Language. Sign language, like English, is always changing. If you learn Sign Language on the West coast and then travel to the East Coast, you will find a different dialect of ASL; although very similar, there are differences. In the United States you will find many dialects of Sign Language - from SEE sign (Signed Exact English), which follows English grammar rules when using modified ASL signs, to the Rochester Method, where every single word is <b>finger</b> <b>spelled</b> out in the English Language, generally without the use of signs. There is a grey area in between 'English' and 'ASL' known as Contact Variety (previously referred to as Pidgin Sign Language, or PSE), which uses any number of combinations of English word order/grammar combined with aspects of ASL (or SEE). You then have people that are not originally from the United States that move here and once they acclimate to ASL, what they sign becomes a mixture of ASL, SEE and their native countries' Sign Language, creating yet another dialect of Sign Language.|$|R

50|$|Preservation of the Sign Language is {{a two-minute}} film, {{presented}} without subtitles, featuring George Veditz, onetime {{president of the}} National Association of the Deaf (NAD) of the United States, demonstrating in sign language the importance of defending the right of deaf people to sign as opposed to verbalizing their communication.

Taking care to sign precisely and in large gestures for the cameras, Veditz chose fiery biblical passages to give his speech emotional impact. In some of his films, Veditz used <b>finger</b> <b>spelling</b> so his gestures could be translated directly into English in venues where interpreters were present. On behalf of the NAD, Veditz made this film specifically to record sign language for posterity at a time when oralists (those who promoted lip reading and speech in lieu of sign language) were gaining momentum in the education of the deaf.

5000|$|According to Goldin-Meadow, reading {{requires}} two essential abilities: {{familiarity with}} a language {{and understanding the}} mapping between that language and the written word. At birth, deaf children are deficient in both. However, reading is possible if deaf children learn ASL, a linguistic code that although, not based on sounds, is still nonetheless a language. Once they have acquired ASL, deaf children learn how to map between sign language and print {{so that they can}} learn English. Several techniques are used to help bridge the gap between ASL and spoken language or the [...] "translation process" [...] such as sandwiching and chaining. Sandwiching consists of alternating between saying the word and signing it. Chaining consists of <b>finger</b> <b>spelling</b> a word, pointing to the spoken language version of the word and using pictorial support. Although chaining is not widely used, it creates an understanding between the visual spelling of a word and the sign language spelling of the word. This helps the child become bilingual in both ASL and spoken language. More importantly, the deaf child's social context is crucial for nurturing his or her capacity to read. Research shows that deaf children born to deaf parents are usually better readers than deaf children born to hearing parents. This {{is due to the fact}} that deaf parents provide a strong social and emotional network and may immediately have access to the necessary resources for their child. Deaf parents already anticipate the needs of their child, having been through the same experience, as opposed to a hearing parent.Although MCE is helpful, ASL is the key component for deaf children's reading. Deaf children who made progress in ASL and MCE also made progress in reading English, but children who only made some progress in MCE didn’t make progress in reading English. More evidence for the necessity of acquiring ASL is reflected in studies comparing reading scores and ratings of sign language performance. According to Meadow, there is a positive relationship between speech reading scores and ratings for speech, expressive <b>finger</b> <b>spelling</b> and sign usage. Contrary to popular belief, this strongly suggests that deaf children with ASL in fact do acquire strong reading skills. However, children who do not have language such as ASL to map the printed code can never read. Hence, in order for a deaf child to learn to read, he or she must know ASL beforehand. The sooner the child learns ASL the better he or she will be at developing effective communicative skills. Mastery of written language is especially important today as we are moving into the Information Age. In order to succeed, one must possess strong reading and writing skills.|$|E
5000|$|Gestural {{languages}} such as American Sign Language and {{its regional}} siblings operate as complete natural languages that are gestural in modality. They {{should not be}} confused with <b>finger</b> <b>spelling,</b> in which a set of emblematic gestures are used to represent a written alphabet. American sign language is different from gesturing in that concepts are modeled by certain hand motions or expressions and has a specific established structure while gesturing is more malleable and has no specific structure rather it supplements speech. We should note, that before an established sign language was created in Nicaragua after the 1970s, deaf communities would use [...] "home signs" [...] in order to communicate with each other. These home signs were not part of a unified language but were still used as familiar motions and expressions used within their family—still closely related to language rather than gestures with no specific structure. This is similar to what has been observed in the gestural actions of chimpanzees. Gestures are used by these animals in place of verbal language, which is restricted in animals due to their lacking certain physiological and articulatory abilities that humans have for speech. Corballis (2009) asserts that [...] "our hominin ancestors were better pre-adapted to acquire language-like competence using manual gestures than using vocal sounds." [...] This leads to a debate about whether humans, too, looked to gestures first as their modality of language in the early existence of the species. The function of gestures may have been a significant player in the evolution of language.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the first}} Icelandic teacher, Rev. Páll Pálsson, was {{employed}} in Iceland in 1867, Icelandic deaf children attended {{a school in}} Copenhagen. In 1874, Pálsson outlined his objectives for teaching his students in a newspaper article. He wanted his students {{to be able to}} express their thoughts and be understood through writing, finger language and pointing, and did not care about speaking Icelandic or lip reading. In 1922, the Danish Mouth-Hand system was adopted as the new teaching method, with the objective of having the students speak and understand speech augmented with <b>finger</b> <b>spelling</b> and signs. A change was made in 1944 to the educational system and Oralism was adopted. All signing was banned in the classroom because the sole objective of Oralism was to teach the students to speak and understand Icelandic. In the early eighties, new principal Guðlaug Snorradóttir introduced a new teaching method called Total Communication to the Deaf School. The Total Communication method involved using multiple methods for communicating, including the manual alphabet, signs, gestures, lip-reading, and writing. This was not teaching Icelandic Sign Language as they only taught single signs and no grammar. The main objective of the school remained teaching the students to speak and understand Icelandic. The teachers at the school did not know Icelandic Sign Language, and so the students could only communicate with them through speaking. Berglind Stefánsdóttir was appointed as the first deaf principle of the Deaf School in 1996. It was during her term that bilingualism became the objective for students. In 2002 the Deaf School was merged into the hearing school, and while bilingualism was still promoted, the deaf children were still being taught with techniques developed for hearing children. Icelandic Sign Language has only a marginal role in the classroom.|$|E

40|$|Abstract�Finger {{spelling}} {{is an art}} {{of communicating}} by signs made with fingers, and has been introduced into sign language {{to serve as a}} bridge between the sign language and the verbal language. Previous approaches to <b>finger</b> <b>spelling</b> recognition are classified into two categories: glove-based and vision-based approaches. The glove-based approach is simpler and more accurate recognizing work of hand posture than vision-based, yet the interfaces require the user to wear a cumbersome and carry a load of cables that connected the device to a computer. In contrast, the vision-based approaches provide an attractive alternative to the cumbersome interface, and promise more natural and unobtrusive human-computer interaction. The vision-based approaches generally consist of two steps: hand extraction and recognition, and two steps are processed independently. This paper proposes real-time vision-based Korean <b>finger</b> <b>spelling</b> recognition system by integrating hand extraction into recognition. First, we tentatively detect a hand region using CAMShift algorithm. Then fill factor and aspect ratio estimated by width and height estimated by CAMShift are used to choose candidate from database, which can reduce the number of matching in recognition step. To recognize the <b>finger</b> <b>spelling,</b> we use DTW(dynamic time warping) based on modified chain codes, to be robust to scale and orientation variations. In this procedure, since accurate hand regions, without holes and noises, should be extracted to improve the precision, we use graph cuts algorithm that globally minimize the energy function elegantly expressed by Markov random fields (MRFs). In the experiments, the computational times are less than 130 ms, and the times are not related to the number of templates of finger spellings in database, as candidate templates are selected in extraction step. ...|$|E
