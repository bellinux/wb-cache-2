The effect of substrate on magnetic and electric {{properties of the}} multilayer films was investigated. Compared to the films on glass substrates, higher coercivity, larger uniaxial-anisotropy field were achieved for the <b>flexible</b> <b>films.</b> The values of the resistivities for the <b>flexible</b> <b>films</b> are {{of the order of}} 10 mΩ•cm, which is two orders higher than the value of 0. 1 mΩ•cm for the multilayer films on glass substrates.

40|$|Flexible {{magnetic}} devices, i. e., magnetic devices fabricated on flexible substrates, {{are very}} attractive in application of detecting magnetic field in arbitrary surface, non-contact actuators, and microwave devices {{due to the}} stretchable, biocompatible, light-weight, portable, and low cost properties. <b>Flexible</b> magnetic <b>films</b> are essential for the realization of various functionalities of flexible magnetic devices. To give a comprehensive understanding for <b>flexible</b> magnetic <b>films</b> and related devices, we have reviewed recent advances in the studies of <b>flexible</b> magnetic <b>films</b> including fabrication methods, magnetic and transport properties of <b>flexible</b> magnetic <b>films,</b> and their applications in magnetic sensors, actuators, and microwave devices. Three typical methods were introduced to prepare the <b>flexible</b> magnetic <b>films.</b> Stretching or bending the <b>flexible</b> magnetic <b>films</b> offers {{a good way to}} apply mechanical strain on magnetic films, so that magnetic anisotropy, exchanged bias, coercivity, and magnetoresistance can be effectively manipulated. Finally, a series of examples were shown to demonstrate the great potential of <b>flexible</b> magnetic <b>films</b> for future applications. Comment: 30 pages, 24 figure...|$|R

500|$|The {{project would}} soon head off in more {{productive}} directions, largely impelled by a trip of Edison's to Europe and the Exposition Universelle in Paris, {{for which he}} departed August 2 or 3, 1889. During his two months abroad, Edison visited with scientist-photographer Étienne-Jules Marey, who had devised a [...] "chronophotographic gun"—the first portable motion picture camera—which used a strip of <b>flexible</b> <b>film</b> designed to capture sequential images at twelve frames per second. Upon {{his return to the}} United States, Edison filed another patent caveat, on November 2, which described a Kinetoscope based not just on a flexible filmstrip, but one in which the film was perforated to allow for its engagement by sprockets, making its mechanical conveyance much more smooth and reliable. The first motion picture system to employ a perforated image band was apparently the Théâtre Optique, patented by French inventor Charles-Émile Reynaud in 1888. Reynaud's system did not use photographic film, but images painted on gelatine frames. At the Exposition Universelle, Edison would have seen both the Théâtre Optique and the electrical tachyscope of German inventor Ottamar Anschütz. This disc-based projection device {{is often referred to as}} an important conceptual source for the development of the Kinetoscope. Its crucial innovation was to take advantage of the persistence of vision theory by using an intermittent light source to momentarily [...] "freeze" [...] the projection of each image; the goal was to facilitate the viewer's retention of many minutely different stages of a photographed activity, thus producing a highly effective illusion of constant motion. By late 1890, intermittent visibility would be integral to the Kinetoscope's design.|$|E
2500|$|On December 18, 1895 Charles Francis Jenkins {{showed off}} his film {{projector}} at the Franklin Institute. It {{was the first}} demonstration of moving pictures using <b>flexible</b> <b>film</b> in Philadelphia. A week later Woodville Latham's eidoloscope was shown to Philadelphia audiences. German immigrant and optician, Siegmund Lubin, {{was impressed with the}} technology and bought Jenkins' camera. In Philadelphia he filmed his first film, his horse eating hay. Lubin continued to make films in Philadelphia, now showing them commercially, and built his own cameras and projectors which he marketed. He eventually created a production company, Lubin Manufacturing Company, in 1902. Shortly afterwards Lubin opened up some of the cities first movie theaters and in 1905 Jules Mastbaum opened the city's first Nickelodeon. Lubin Studios shut down in 1917 and through most of the 20th Century Philadelphia had an almost non-existent film industry. In 1985 the Greater Philadelphia Film Office was created as part of the city government, and, in 1992, it became a regional economic office. Since 1992 the GPFO, which promotes the Philadelphia region and helps coordinate film productions, has assisted in the making of over 200 films and television shows. Between 1992 and 2002 film productions have brought in US$500 Million to the city's economy. In 2007 MovieMaker Magazine named Philadelphia the second-best American city to make a movie in. The magazine cites local talent, cost of living and help provided by the Philadelphia Film Office as reasons. Several months after the MovieMaker Magazine article, Pacifica Ventures announced that it will be opening a film studio in the Philadelphia area in 2008. Every year Philadelphia hosts the Philadelphia Film Festival and the Philadelphia International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival.

Here, we demonstrate the highly sensitive and programmable thermal-sensing capability (thermal index, B, up to 126 × 103 K) of <b>flexible</b> <b>films</b> with tunable sandwiched microstructures (PDMS/cracked {{single-walled carbon nanotube}} (SWCNT) film/PDMS) when a thermal stimulus is applied. We found that this excellent performance results from the following features of the film's structural and material design: (1) the sandwiched structure allows the film to switch from a three-dimensional to a two-dimensional in-plane deformation and (2) the stiffness of the SWCNT film is decreased by introducing microcracks that make deformation easy and that promote the macroscopic piezoresistive behavior of SWCNT crack islands and the microscopic piezoresistive behavior of SWCNT bundles. The PDMS layer {{is characterized by a}} high coefficient of thermal expansion (α = 310 × 10 - 6 K- 1) and low stiffness (∼ 2 MPa) that allow for greater flexibility and higher temperature sensitivity.
