40|$|A {{successor}} version 3 of <b>DISORT</b> (<b>DISORT</b> 3) {{is presented}} with important upgrades that improve the accuracy, efficiency, {{and stability of}} the algorithm. Compared with version 2 (<b>DISORT</b> 2 released in 2000) these upgrades include (a) a redesigned BRDF computation that improves both speed and accuracy, (b) a revised treatment of the single scattering correction, and (c) additional efficiency and stability upgrades for beam sources. In <b>DISORT</b> 3 the BRDF computation is improved in the following three ways: (i) the Fourier decomposition is prepared "off-line", thus avoiding the repeated internal computations done in <b>DISORT</b> 2; (ii) a large enough number of terms in the Fourier expansion of the BRDF is employed to guarantee accurate values of the expansion coefficients (default is 200 instead of 50 in <b>DISORT</b> 2); (iii) in the post processing step {{the reflection of the}} direct attenuated beam from the lower boundary is included resulting in a more accurate single scattering correction. These improvements in the treatment of the BRDF have led to improved accuracy and a several-fold increase in speed. In addition, the stability of beam sources has been improved by removing a singularity occurring when the cosine of the incident beam angle is too close to the reciprocal of any of the eigenvalues. The efficiency for beam sources has been further improved from reducing by a factor of 2 (compared to <b>DISORT</b> 2) the dimension of the linear system of equations that must be solved to obtain the particular solutions, and by replacing the LINPAK routines used in <b>DISORT</b> 2 by LAPACK 3. 5 in <b>DISORT</b> 3.

40|$|A principal-component based {{radiative}} transfer model (PCRTM) is developed for simulating the infrared spectral radiance {{at the top}} of the atmosphere (TOA). The PCRTM approach removes the redundancy in {{radiative transfer}} calculation in high resolution infrared spectra, and saves significant amount of computational time with great accuracy.
