2500|$|Bradley and Derry again {{reached the}} National League final in 2009, but were {{defeated}} by Kerry. Derry opened their 2009 Championship campaign {{with a win}} over Monaghan. However, they were defeated in the next round by Tyrone. Bradley was named captain for that game {{in the absence of}} suspended regular captain Fergal Doherty and injured vice-captain Niall McCusker. Bradley only scored one point against Tyrone and it later emerged he was carrying an injury into the game. They were drawn against Monaghan again {{in the first round of}} the Qualifiers. On Monday 6 July 2009, five days ahead of the second clash with Monaghan, shock reports emerged that Bradley had quit the Derry panel. Speculation had mounted that he told the then county manager Damian Cassidy he was leaving after an <b>in-house</b> <b>training</b> game the day before. The Derry County Board released a statement on Monday night stating [...] "Such rumours are totally unfounded and without substance". Bradley played against Monaghan and scored 2-08 (2-06 from play) in a man-of-the-match performance. Derry's 2009 campaign however ended the following week with defeat to Donegal, with Bradley being forced off injured in the second half.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of labor market conditions on a firm's incentive to train its workers. In an equilibrium model {{of the labor market}} in which firms use both untrained and <b>in-house</b> <b>trained</b> workers, we show that the incidence of training increases with the tightness of the labor market. In a multi-sector framework, the usual threat of hold-up by a trained worker is more severe for workers who change their sector of work; during downturns, this serves to bias firms' incentives in imparting training away from such workers and towards workers already in the firm and those new workers coming from the same sector. Evidence from the NLSY confirms both predictions [...] - the incidence and duration of company-sponsored training is adversely affected by higher unemployment rates; furthermore, this negative effect is much stronger for workers who change industries as compared to those who do not. firm-sponsored training, labor market tightness, hold up, unemployment rate...|$|R
