25|$|In September 2011, the UK Rail Safety and Standards Board issued Railway Group Standard GM/RT2453 (issue two), {{which made}} some {{alterations}} to the TOPS classes allocated to {{various types of}} locomotive and multiple unit. This extended the number ranges for certain types of locomotive or multiple unit where there was otherwise a danger of available class numbers running out. The document also confirmed that British locomotives and passenger rolling stock operating on domestic routes only, need not display their full 12-digit <b>European</b> <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Number.</b>|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This study {{investigated}} the effects of different response strategies, vehicle location strategies and <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers</b> on response times in a simulated Emergency Medical Services system. The simulation was a computer model using discrete-event simulation and the model was based on Western Cape Emergency Medical Services operations in Cape Town. The study objectives were to (i) create the simulation model, (ii) determine the best-performing combination of explanatory factors and (iii) {{determine the effect of}} increasing <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers</b> on response time performance. The simulation model took into account incident arrival rates, incident and hospital spatial distributions, <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers</b> and dispatch practices in the modelled system. Verification and validation of the simulation model utilised a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. The validated simulation model was changed in two ways: (i) the response strategy was changed to either single or two-tier (the response model factor) and (ii) the vehicle location strategy was changed to either dynamic or static (the vehicle location factor). This yielded four individual models each representing one combination of these factors. Each simulation model was run for a simulated period of seven days. Output data were analysed using multivariate analysis of variance in order to identify differences in response time between the factor combinations. A single-tier model using dynamic vehicle locations produced the best response performance. This model was run repeatedly, increasing <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers</b> incrementally with each run to assess the effect of increased <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers</b> on response time performance. A doubling of <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers</b> resulted in an 14 % {{increase in the number of}} responses meeting the national performance target for high acuity incidents, while a seven-fold increase in <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers</b> increased this to 15 %. No further performance increases were seen beyond this with increased <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers.</b> A 2 % performance increase for lower acuity incidents was seen with the same increase in <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers.</b> In the system modelled, increasing <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers</b> should not be expected to realise anything more than small improvements in response time performance, at a high operational cost. Fine-grained dynamic deployment of vehicles in anticipation of system demand appears to be a more important determinant of response performance than <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers</b> alone...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} a {{framework}} that uses a camera installed at roadside to detect the <b>vehicle</b> <b>number</b> plate. A typical video component requires several adjustments after image has been stored such as enhancement of image, localization of number plate, separating each character and recognition of each character. In this work we extract the <b>vehicle</b> <b>number</b> plate from our image and then recognize it based {{on the characteristics of}} number plates in different countries. We use Sobel edge detection for plate localization, template matching and fuzzy logic for recognition. We make use of the characteristics of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>number</b> sequences to further enhance performance. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>number</b> plate recognition can be used to decrease human effort by making systems automatic...|$|R

40|$|ABSTARCT: The {{purpose of}} this paper work is to develop a real time {{application}} which recognizes <b>Vehicle</b> <b>number</b> plates from cars at a gate, for example at the entrance of a parking area or a border crossing. The system, based on regular PC with video camera, catches video frames which include a visible car <b>Vehicle</b> <b>number</b> plate and processes them. Once a <b>Vehicle</b> <b>number</b> plate is detected, its digits are recognized, displayed on the User Interface or checked against a database. The focus is on the design of algorithms used for extracting the <b>Vehicle</b> <b>number</b> plate from a single image, isolating the characters of the plate and identifying the individual characters. The Proposed system can be implemented using Vision Assistant & LabVIEW 2010. The performance of the system can be investigated on real images of the number plates of different vehicles...|$|R
