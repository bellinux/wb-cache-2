5|$|The Great Western Main Line from London to Bristol is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> electrified.

This will leave Temple Meads un-electrified but the new Hitachi Super Express trains are bi-mode so can operate as diesels around Bristol and can use electricity where the electrification work is complete.

30|$|On <b>the</b> other hand, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of {{products}} from Europe, <b>the</b> CFP <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> transportation accounted for 50 % of the total. Regarding the production stage, <b>the</b> CFP <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> lumbering, kiln drying and finishing accounted for 11, 7 and 3 % of the total, respectively. Energy consumption volumes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> lumbering and finishing of “certified wood in Kyoto Prefecture” {{and other products}} were based on Table  4. <b>The</b> differences <b>in</b> energy consumption were attributed to CO 2 emission factor from electricity.

Differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CFP <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> kiln drying were caused {{by the kind of}} heat source. A shift from kerosene to woodchips is an improvement that can be made by lumber mills and local governments. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> following chapter, we examine and compare <b>the</b> CFPs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> kiln drying using different heat sources to develop a method for reducing the CFP of “certified wood in Kyoto Prefecture”.|$|R

Cotton seeds were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> ground, perhaps to produce cooking oil. In addition to basic foodstuffs, the Maya also cultivated prestige crops such as cotton, cacao and vanilla. Cacao was especially prized by the elite, who consumed chocolate beverages.

5|$|A person's {{history of}} taking {{paracetamol}} is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis. The {{most effective way}} to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug nomogram developed in 1975, called the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion. To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury. A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a serum level taken before 4hours is not recommended.|$|E
