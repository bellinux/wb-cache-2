5|$|After departing {{the area}} {{he reached the}} west coast, but Braham had loitered for too long. He spotted two Fw 190s {{approaching}} fast from the east. Braham had shot down two of these machines in a Mosquito but he was uncertain of how experienced these pilots had been. There was no cloud cover and the Mosquito could not outrun the faster and more agile single-engine fighters for long. He decided to turn and fight while <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>could.</b> In a head-on attack the first Fw 190 pilot missed but the second struck the port wing and engine with cannon fire causing a large fire. The instrument panel and cockpit window was shot through missing both Walsh and Braham by inches. Braham dived to the sea levelling out below 100 feet. He tried to use the fire extinguisher to stop the fire. The German pilot shared Braham's philosophy of ensuring a kill by shooting at an enemy aircraft until it came down. The Mosquito was hit again and Braham crash-landed his aircraft onto a beach at 150 miles per hour.|$|E
5|$|Although Musique funèbre was internationally acclaimed, his new {{harmonic}} techniques led {{to something}} of a crisis for Lutosławski, during which <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>could</b> not see how to express his musical ideas. Then on 16 March 1960, listening to Polish Radio broadcast on new music, he happened to hear John Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra. Although he was not influenced by the sound or {{the philosophy of the}} music, Cage's explorations of indeterminacy set off a train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski finding a way to retain the harmonic structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching. His Three Postludes were hastily rounded off (he had intended to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} home to the west from Washington, DC, Knievel decided to stop committing crimes. He joined the motocross circuit and had moderate success, but <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>could</b> not {{make enough money to}} support his family. During 1962, Knievel broke his collarbone and shoulder in a motocross accident. The doctors said he could not race for at least six months. To help support his family, he switched careers and sold insurance for the Combined Insurance Company of America, working for W. Clement Stone. Stone suggested that Knievel read Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude, a book that Stone wrote with Napoleon Hill. Knievel credited much of his later success to Stone and his book.|$|E

25|$|After working {{briefly in}} {{commercial}} aviation, Mantz went to Hollywood, {{attracted by the}} {{large sums of money}} movie stunt pilots were making at the time. A main requirement was Associated Motion Picture Pilots (AMPP) membership but that was only gained after employment in the industry. In an effort to gain notoriety, on July 6, 1930 Mantz set a record in flying 46 consecutive outside loops {{as a part of the}} dedication ceremonies of the San Mateo airport. Although he gained recognition as an accomplished pilot, without the AMPP card, <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>could</b> not work in Hollywood. However, in 1931, Mantz performed the climactic stunt in The Galloping Ghost which required him to fly down a canyon and just miss a prominent sycamore. Misjudging his approach, Mantz crashed into the tree but the film crew got their shot and he got his AMPP card.|$|E

500|$|Ripken batted [...]271 with 14 {{home runs}} and 61 RBI in 1998. On September 20, before the final home {{game of the season}} against the Yankees, Ripken decided to end his streak at 2,632 games, having surpassed Gehrig's {{previous}} record by 502 games. Rookie third baseman Ryan Minor started in his place, at first thinking it was a rookie prank. Realizing that the streak was coming to an end, the fans, his teammates, and the visiting Yankees (with David Wells being the first to notice that Ripken was not playing during batting practice) gave Ripken an ovation after the game's first out was recorded. Ripken later stated that he decided to end the streak {{at the end of the}} season to avoid any offseason controversy about his playing status, and to end the streak entirely on his own terms while <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>could.</b> [...] Ripken returned to the lineup for the final seven games of the season, on the road against the Toronto Blue Jays and Boston Red Sox.|$|E
500|$|When first {{designing}} Ventus, Tetsuya Nomura {{already decided}} the character {{should look like}} Sora or Roxas, and decided to choose the latter when thinking that Vanitas being revealed to have Sora's appearance would give a big impact to the gamers. Nomura wanted Ventus' personality to more closely resemble Sora's, which led to his outgoing personality, {{yet at the same}} time he wanted him to become more serious as the game progressed to make them distinct. Ventus was first shown in the secret endings of Kingdom Hearts II and its rerelease Kingdom Hearts II: Final Mix. Ventus' name first appeared as a code in a 2006 Tokyo Game Show promotional video of the games. While making Final Mixs ending, Nomura had only developed the backstory for Terra, Aqua and Ventus and not their appearances, but had to finish their design for the end of game cameo. Nomura did not reveal their identities, and only stated that the three character were from the chronological past of the Kingdom Hearts series. Following their release, Nomura stated that his nickname was Ven. Ventus was first mentioned by the character Lingering Sentiment in Final Mix as Ven, while his full name was still unrevealed. He also mentioned a connection between him and Xemnas but wanted to leave it up to people's imaginations as <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>could</b> not reveal his identity.|$|E
500|$|Although Terra, Ventus and Aqua first {{appeared}} in the secret ending of Kingdom Hearts II wearing armor, director Tetsuya Nomura still had not designed their final look, having only thought about their story. Despite not revealing their identities, Nomura still said that they are characters from the past from the Kingdom Hearts series. Following the release of the Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, Nomura revealed a connection between them and the game's villain Xemnas, but wanted to leave it up to people's imaginations as <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>could</b> not reveal their identities. Terra's face was first shown in the 2006 Tokyo Game Show in which he was described as an avenger against Xehanort. Nomura also confirmed that the Lingering Will was connected with Terra. He also stated that his name, meaning [...] "earth" [...] from Latin, follows the [...] "land" [...] theme Riku represents, as well as connecting him with the other main characters' names from the series. In October 2007, Nomura was asked if the Lingering Will was actually Terra due to their similarities, but he responded it was still uncertain. When asked about the Will's true nature after being revealed to contain Terra's memories, Nomura stated it was not a Heartless. Nomura expressed that the fans liked the inclusion of the Will's battle due to his challenging difficulty, which led the staff to design another hard boss character for Birth by Sleep.|$|E

500|$|Burgoyne's council {{discussed}} {{whether to}} attack the next day, and a decision was reached to delay further action at least one day, to September 21. The army moved to consolidate the position closer to the American line while some men collected their dead. [...] The attack on the 21st was called off when Burgoyne received a letter dated September 12 from Henry Clinton, who was commanding the British garrison in New York City. [...] Clinton suggested that he could [...] "make a push at [...] Montgomery in about ten days." [...] (Fort Montgomery was an American post on the Hudson River, in the New York Highlands south of West Point). If Clinton left New York on September 22, [...] "about ten days" [...] after he wrote the letter, <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>could</b> not hope to arrive {{in the vicinity of}} Saratoga {{before the end of the}} month. [...] Burgoyne, running low on men and food, was still in a very difficult position, but he decided to wait in the hope that Clinton would arrive to save his army. [...] Burgoyne wrote to Clinton on September 23, requesting some sort of assistance or diversion to draw Gates' army away. [...] Clinton sailed from New York on October 3, and captured Forts Montgomery and Clinton on October 6.

500|$|In May 1934, Barrymore was filming Hat, Coat and Glove for RKO when, {{during the}} filming of one scene, he again forgot his lines and even {{the name of his}} character. Filming was {{postponed}} until the following day, but the result was the same. After he took a break for a few days, he returned to the set, but <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>could</b> not remember any of the script, and RKO replaced him with Ricardo Cortez. Soon afterwards, he suffered a mental and physical breakdown and was hospitalized. Costello confirmed that his drinking over the previous two years had worsened, and she described him as a [...] "hopeless alcoholic". Barrymore's relationship with Costello was deeply troubled and, believing she was going to declare him mentally incompetent, he left their home in Los Angeles and traveled first to London and then to India. He returned to the US in early 1935 and settled in New York, leaving his wife in Los Angeles. Shortly after his return, he was hospitalized for a month with bronchitis and influenza. A 19-year-old fan, Elaine Jacobs, visited him, and the two became good friends. On his release from the hospital, her mother invited him to recuperate at their house. She changed her name to Elaine Barrie, which she explained was to get [...] "as near to Barrymore as I dared", and they began a relationship. In May, the couple underwent the first of several professional collaborations, when they appeared on Rudy Vallée's The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour radio show.|$|E
500|$|On February 14, Trump {{withdrew from}} the race. [...] In a press release, he cited infighting in the Reform Party as not [...] "conducive to victory," [...] {{concluding}} he could not win the election as the party's nominee and so, as pledged, would not continue his campaign. [...] He expressed concerns {{about the direction of}} the party, particularly its membership, referring to David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani as a Klansman, a Neo-Nazi, and a Communist, respectively. [...] However, he lauded party members Russ Verney, Jack Gargan, and others as [...] "wonderful people" [...] he was honored to meet. [...] Trump lamented the exit of Jesse Ventura from the party, arguing [...] "without Jesse, the Reform Party is just an extremist shell and cannot be a force or even a factor in 2000." [...] Trump declined to seek the nomination of Ventura's new Independence Party, finding it [...] "healthy" [...] but too young to win. [...] He expressly kept open the possibility of running for president in 2004. [...] Trump publicly announced his withdrawal on The Today Show in an interview with Matt Lauer. He explained that though <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>could</b> have won the Reform Party nomination, he believed he would only win 20 percent in the general election, which he did not want. [...] He claimed the party {{was on the verge of}} [...] "self-destructing" [...] and referred to it as a [...] "total mess." [...] In response, Pat Choate, who became the new Reform Party chairman after the unseating of Gargan, disputed Trump's claim about the party and said Trump's campaign was meant only [...] "to smear Pat Buchanan." [...] He declared Trump [...] "unwelcome" [...] to seek the party's 2004 presidential nomination. Choate later remarked that he believed Trump's campaign was a [...] "Republican dirty trick" [...] orchestrated by Roger Stone [...] "to disgust people and drive them away from the Reform Party." [...] Stone argued that John McCain [...] "running on Trump's message" [...] and surging in the polls signaled an end to the Trump campaign.|$|E

Powell expressed remorse for hurting Frederick Seward. But most of his discussion was disjointed and rambling, and <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>could</b> not remember his age or place of birth. Doster became convinced that Powell was half-witted.

2500|$|During one of {{the many}} festivals that would take place in the city, the people would gather in their temple and place offerings of food before their idols.

2500|$|A {{member of}} Iași's sociological school and, in Traian Herseni's view, a bearer of Zeletin's legacy, Claudian {{proposed}} a socio-historical analysis of philosophical {{systems in the}} 1935 Cercetări filosofice și sociologice ("Philosophical and Sociological Research"). He applied this concept in two books, Colectivismul în filosofia lui Platon ("Collectivism in the Philosophy of Plato") and Originea socială a filosofiei lui Auguste Comte ("The Social Origin of Auguste Comte's Philosophy"), both published in 1936. Cunoaștere și suflet ("Knowledge an Spirit", 1940) presents his approach to the sociology of knowledge. <b>He</b> <b>still</b> <b>could</b> not find employment in his field, but in January 1937 was offered a lecturer's position in the Department of Logic.
