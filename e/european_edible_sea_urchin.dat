40|$|The fishery for the <b>edible</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Paracentrotus lividus is {{of great}} {{importance}} to many European regions, although in some of them this species has shown a wide scale decline in recent years. This paper reports on direct (on P. lividus) and indirect (on the co-occurring but not fished echinoid, Arbacia lixula) effects of <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> harvesting in shallow rocky reefs in North-western Sardinia (Italy, central-western Mediterranean Sea), where this activity is intensively practised. Density, size (test diameter), and biomass of both species were assessed in autumn 2004 at two locations impacted by P. lividus fishery, and at two controls within an adjacent Marine Protected Area. Density of P. lividus and A. lixula was significantly greater at the controls than at the exploited locations. The average test diameter of P. lividus was also significantly larger at the controls, where large-sized specimens (i. e. > 5 cm) were notably more abundant. The average size of A. lixula did not significantly differ between the impacted locations and the controls. The average biomass of P. lividus was significantly greater at the controls than at the exploited locations, whereas no differences were detected for A. lixula. These results reveal {{the existence of a}} heavy fishing impact on P. lividus in North-western Sardinia and the need for regulation of its harvesting to prevent severe direct effects on its populations. Since no indirect effects on A. lixula have been detected, it could be hypothesized that this species did not benefit from P. lividus fishery due to an only moderate competition for habitat and resources between these two echinoids.

40|$|Quantitative {{surveys of}} the <b>edible</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin,</b> Paracentrotus lividus, were {{conducted}} in four fishing zones of Sardinia (Southern Italy, Mediterranean Sea), in Autumn 2007. A total of 120 stations were geo-located along a bathymetric gradient ranging from 0 to 10 m. A geostatistical method {{was used to evaluate}} spatial patterns in density and to estimate harvestable stocks. Variographic analyses showed that the isotropic Gaussian and spherical models successfully explained the spatial structure of <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> assemblages in these areas.

40|$|Collagen {{has become}} a key-molecule in cell culture studies and in the tissue {{engineering}} field. Industrially, the principal sources of collagen are calf skin and bones which, however, could be associated to risks of serious disease transmission. In fact, collagen derived from alternative and riskless sources is required, and marine organisms are among the safest and recently exploited ones. <b>Sea</b> <b>urchins</b> possess a circular area of soft tissue surrounding the mouth, the peristomial membrane (PM), mainly composed by mammalian-like collagen. The PM of the <b>edible</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Paracentrotus lividus therefore represents a potential unexploited collagen source, easily obtainable as a food industry waste product.

40|$|Aquaculture is {{a fast-growing}} {{industry}} contributing to global food security and sustainable aquaculture, which may reduce pressures on capture fisheries. The overall {{objective of this}} thesis was {{to look at the}} immunostimulatory effects of different aspects of aquaculture on the host response of the <b>edible</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin,</b> Paracentrotus lividus, which are a prized delicacy (roe) in many Asian and Mediterranean countries. In Chapter 1, the importance of understanding the biology, ecology, and physiology of P. lividus, as well as the current status in the culture of this organism for mass production and introducing the thesis objectives for following chapters is discussed. As the research commenced, the difficulties of identifying individuals for repeat sampling became clear; therefore, Chapter 2 was a tagging experiment that indicated PIT tagging was a successful way of identifying individual <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> over time with a high tag retention rate. However, it was also found that repeat sampling via syringe to measure host response of an individual caused stress which masked results and thus animals would be sampled and sacrificed going forward. Additionally, from personal observations and discussion with peers, it was suggested to look at the effect that diet has on <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> immune function and the parameters I measured which led to Chapter 3. In this chapter, both Laminaria digitata and Mytilus edulis were shown to influence measured immune parameters of differential cell counts, nitric oxide production, and lysozyme activity. Therefore, trials commencing after Trial 5 in Chapter 4, were modified to include starvation in order to remove any effect of diet. Another important aspect of culturing any organism is the study of their immune function and its response to several immunostimulatory agents (Chapter 4). Zymosan A was shown to be an effective immunostimulatory agent in P. lividus. Further work on handled/stored animals (Chapter 5) showed Zymosan A reduced the measured levels of some immune parameters measured relative to the control, which may reduce the amount of stress in the animals. In Chapter 6, animals were infected with Vibrio anguillarum and, although V. anguillarum, impacted immune parameters of P. lividus, it did not cause mortality as predicted. Lastly, throughout this thesis work, it was noted that the immune parameters measured produced different values at different times of the year (Chapter 7); therefore, using collated baseline (control) data, results were compiled to observe seasonal effects. It was determined that both seasonality and sourcing sites influenced immune parameter measurements taken at different times throughout the year. In conclusion, this thesis work fits into the framework of development of aquaculture practices that affect immune function of the host and future research focusing on the <b>edible</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin,</b> P. lividus...|$|R

In recent years, however, its {{stocks have}} shown a large reduction in several regions because of overfishing. This paper reports the effects of harvesting on P. lividus population structure in shallow rocky reefs from a central-western Mediterranean area where this activity is intensively practiced. Density, size (test diam), and biomass of <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> were assessed in October 2004 (just before the fishing season) and in May 2005 (immediately after the fishing season) at two locations where intense P. lividus harvest occurs and at two controls within an adjacent Marine Protected Area (MPA) where P. lividus harvest is prohibited. Density, size, and average biomass of P. lividus were significantly higher at the protected areas than at the exploited ones. In particular, large-sized specimens (test diam > 5 cm) were notably less abundant at the fished locations; however, very similar results were detected for both the periods examined (i. e., {{before and after the}} fishing season), suggesting that effects of pressing activity of harvest through the past years may have produced effects much more evident than those attributable to the single fishing season. These results reveal the existence of a heavy-fishing impact on P. lividus in northwestern Sardinia and the urgent need of regulating its harvesting to prevent severe direct effects on its populations...|$|R

Size, single and pooled species densities, density of large individuals (> 40 mm long) and small individuals (< 20 mm long) of the two species were estimated by scuba diving in autumn 2003, spring and summer 2004 at two sites impacted by P. lividus fishing (Punta Cavazzi and Pagliaro, take zone C) and one control (Cala Sidoti, no take zone). Two samplings were performed in each season. We found that reduced densities of P. lividus and A. lixula occurred at the fished sites compared with the unfished sites. P. lividus was always larger and more abundant at the protected site than the fished ones, whereas A. lixula had a larger density at the protected site and greater size at the fished sites. The significantly lower density of A. lixula at the sites subjected to fishing of P. lividus could suggest that A. lixula did not benefit from this kind of fishing and thus the two <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> might partially share the same habitat and resources in the barren habitats of “Ustica Island” MPA.

40|$|The {{viscoelastic}} {{properties of}} vertebrate connective tissues rarely undergo significant changes within physiological timescales, {{the only major}} exception being the reversible destiffening of the mammalian uterine cervix {{at the end of}} pregnancy. In contrast to this, the connective tissues of echinoderms (<b>sea</b> <b>urchins,</b> starfish, <b>sea</b> cucumbers, etc.) can switch reversibly between stiff and compliant conditions in timescales of around a second to minutes. Elucidation of the molecular mechanism underlying such mutability has implications for the zoological, ecological and evolutionary field. Important information could also arise for veterinary and biomedical sciences, particularly regarding the pathological plasticization or stiffening of connective tissue structures. In the present investigation we analyzed aspects of the ultrastructure and biochemistry in two representative models, the compass depressor ligament and the peristomial membrane of the <b>edible</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Paracentrotus lividus, compared in three different mechanical states. The results provide further evidence that the mechanical adaptability of echinoderm connective tissues does not necessarily imply changes in the collagen fibrils themselves. The higher glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content registered in the peristomial membrane with respect to the compass depressor ligament suggests a diverse role of these molecules in the two mutable collagenous tissues. The possible involvement of GAG in the mutability phenomenon will need further clarification. During the shift from a compliant to a standard condition, significant changes in GAG content were detected only in the compass depressor ligament. Similarities in terms of ultrastructure (collagen fibrillar assembling) and biochemistry (two alpha chains) were found between the two models and mammalian collagen.

40|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> Arbacia lixula and Paracentrotus lividus {{are common}} on shallow subtidal reefs in the Mediterranean. Previous {{studies on the}} ecology of these species {{reported}} that P. lividus is generally more abundant on horizontal or gently sloping substrata, where it forages mainly on erect algae. In contrast, A. lixula is more common on vertical substrata and it is considered a main grazer of encrusting coralline algae. Observations on some rocky shores in the Ligurian sea indicated that P. lividus occurs mainly in crevices {{at the bottom of}} the vertical walls, and that neither species is present on horizontal or sub-horizontal substrata. In this study we investigated the distribution and abundance of the two species of <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> on vertical substrata at different spatial scales and through time. A field experiment was used to test whether A. lixula constrained the distribution of P. lividus on vertical substrata, and to test for the predicted differences in the effects of the 2 species on assemblages of algae and invertebrates. Four treatments were used: (1) control (<b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> left untouched); (2) A. lixula removed, P. lividus present; (3) A. lixula present, P. lividus removed, and (4) both species removed. The effects of <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> on colonising algae and invertebrates were examined after 6, 12 and 18 months. A. lixula was consistently more abundant than P. lividus on patches of vertical substrata, but the removal of A. lixula did not affect the abundance of P. lividus. There was no effect of A. lixula on encrusting corallines, but the cover erect algae increased and the number of limpets decreased significantly where A. lixula was removed. P. lividus had only a minor impact on the assemblage, probably due to its low abundance. A. lixula had effects close to those predicted for P. lividus, suggesting that the ecological role of these herbivores may be more similar than previously thought.

Natural antimicrobial peptides are considered promising candidates for drug development. Echinoderms, which rely on innate immunity factors in the defence against harmful microorganisms, are sources of novel antimicrobial peptides. This study aimed to isolate and characterise antimicrobial peptides from the <b>Edible</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Echinus esculentus. Using bioassay-guided purification and cDNA cloning, three antimicrobial peptides were characterised from the haemocytes of the sea urchin; two heterodimeric peptides and a cysteine-rich peptide. The peptides were named EeCentrocin 1 and 2 and EeStrongylocin 2, respectively, due to their apparent homology to the published centrocins and strongylocins isolated from the green <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis. The two centrocin-like peptides EeCentrocin 1 and 2 are intramolecularly connected via a disulphide bond to form a heterodimeric structure, containing a cationic heavy chain of 30 and 32 amino acids and a light chain of 13 amino acids. Additionally, the light chain of EeCentrocin 2 seems to be N-terminally blocked by a pyroglutamic acid residue. The heavy chains of EeCentrocins 1 and 2 were synthesised and shown {{to be responsible for}} the antimicrobial activity of the natural peptides.

Despite these preventative measures, many facilities are likely to face occasional reductions in pH and corresponding reductions in carbonate saturation states due to the accumulation of metabolic waste products. We investigated the impact of reduced carbonate saturation states (Omega Ca, Omega Ar) on embryonic developmental rates, larval developmental rates, and echinoplutei skeletal morphometrics in the common <b>edible</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Lytechinus variegatus under high alkalinity conditions. Commercial artificial seawater was bubbled with a mixture of air and CO 2 gas to reduce the carbonate saturation state. Rates of embryonic and larval development were significantly delayed in both the low and extreme low carbonate saturation state groups relative to the control at a given time. Although symmetry of overall skeletal body lengths was not affected, allometric relationships were significantly different between treatment groups. Larvae reared under ambient conditions had significantly greater postoral arm and overall body lengths relative to body lengths than larvae grown under extreme low carbonate saturation state conditions, indicating that extreme changes in the carbonate system affected not only developmental rates but also larval skeletal shape. Reduced rates of embryonic development and delayed and altered larval skeletal growth are likely to negatively impact larval culturing of L. variegatus in land-based, intensive culture situations where calcite and aragonite saturation states are lowered by the accumulation of metabolic waste products...|$|R

Eleven monthly samplings were carried out from April 1996 to May 1997 in each area and samples of between 88 and 100 organisms were collected. Test diameter, total wet weight, and wet gonad weight was measured for each organism. Sex, gonad index, maturity index and gametogenic condition were estimated for each organism through histological analyses. The results indicate that L. albus in the Magellan region has an annual reproductive cycle in which the temporal sequence of different gametogenic processes can not be distinguished accurately due to the rapid and continuous gonadal recovery and gamete production after the spawning period. Although mature organisms were present most of the year, simultaneous spawning {{of males and females}} occurred from August to September in Dawson Island and from July to September in the Cockburn Channel. Gametes of those organisms that became mature after the spawning period were resorbed by nutritive phagocytes. Results from this study suggest that small-scale variability of spawning period in the Magellan region may be explained by the differences in food type and availability among areas. Our results also suggest that the Magellan region is an exception to the latitudinal pattern of spawning period reported for most of the Chilean coast. This large-scale variability may be explained by the simultaneous occurrence of low temperatures and short days during late winter and early spring...|$|R

The purple <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> endoskeletons were characterized by a high content of total carbonates (∼ 94 %), a moderately alkaline pH in water (pH 7. 88) and electrical conductivity values (3. 55 mS/cm) {{very similar to those}} of commercial lime. To evaluate the influence of the P. lividus endoskeletons on soil properties four different amendment rates were tested, notably 0. 5, 1. 0, 3. 0 and 5. 0 % based on soil dry weight, and the effects compared with those recorded on unamended control soil. The addition of the purple <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> processing waste caused an immediate and significant pH increase which was positively related to the rate of the amendment addition. After a six months equilibration period, the differences in soil pH were still evident and significant increases of electrical conductivity and available phosphorus were also detected in soils with the higher amendment rates. The number of heterotrophic and cellulolytic bacteria and actinomycetes significantly increased after amendment addition while the number of culturable fungi steadily declined. The analysis of the Biolog Community Level Physiological Profile indicated a clear influence of the purple <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> processing waste on the structure of the native microbial community while a significant increase of microbial functionality (i. e. dehydrogenase activity) was recorded in soil treated with the higher amendment rates (i. e. 3. 0 and 5. 0 %). The improvement of microbial abundance and functionality as well as the change of the microbial community structure were ascribed to the pH shift induced by the P. lividus processing waste. To investigate possible effects on soil fertility, dwarf bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and wheat (Triticum vulgare) growth were also assessed in a pot experiment. Plant growth was unaffected (wheat) or stimulated (bean) by the amendment addition in the 0. 5 – 3. 0 % range while the higher amendment rate (i. e. 5. 0 %) was detrimental for both plant species indicating a phytotoxic effect which could be due to different factors such as an excess of calcium in soil, a suppression of Mg uptake or the higher EC values detected at the highest amendment rate. It is concluded that ground P. lividus endoskeletons have potential as a soil amendment to ameliorate chemical and biological properties of acidic Mediterranean soils. This seems particularly relevant, especially at the lower amendment rates, since for the first time, a sustainable management system is proposed for P. lividus processing waste, which foresees economic value in the <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> by-product through its re-use within the agricultural production system...|$|R
40|$|The <b>edible</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Echinometra lucunter (Linnaeus, 1758) is a {{very common}} species on the sublittoral-midlittoral in Brazilian rocky shores. The aim of this work was to {{describe}} the gametogenesis and reproductive strategy of the E. lucunter population at Muro Alto beach in the Northeast coast of Brazil from August 2004 to August 2005. A total of 240 specimens were collected on the sandstone reef flat from a tidepool during spring low tides. The overall sex ratio was 1. 12 : 1,withoutsignificanttemporalvariationexceptinOctober 2004. Firsts sexual maturity ocurred in individuals from a diameter of 20. 8 mm. There {{was not a significant}} difference in gonad index between females and males during the sampling period. The female's gonad index variation was associated with a well-defined spawning, corroborated by the histological analysis of the gonads, which demonstrates sex differences of the gamete production. By contrast, the males showed no clear pattern. It is suggested that continuous reproduction with seasonal peaks in the E. lucunter population occurs at Muro Alto beach. O ouriço-do-mar comestível Echinometra lucunter (Linnaeus, 1758) é uma espécie muito comum no infralitoral e mediolitoral do Brasil. O objetivo deste trabalho foi descrever a gametogênese e a estratégia reprodutiva da população de E. lucunterna praia de Muro Alto entre agosto de 2004 e agosto de 2005. Um total de 240 espécimes foi capturado de uma poça de maré situada no topo recifal, durante as marés baixas de sizígia. A razão sexual total foi de 1, 12 : 1 sem variação temporal significativa, exceto em outubro de 2004. A primeira maturidade sexual ocorreu em indivíduos a partir de 20, 8 mm de diâmetro. Não houve nenhuma diferença significativa no índice gonadal entre fêmeas e machos durante o período de amostragem. A variação do índice gonadal das fêmeas foi associada a um período de desova bem definido, corroborado pela análise histológica das gônadas, que demonstra diferenças sexuais na produção de gametas. Ao contrário, os machos não apresentaram nenhum padrão. Sugere-se que a reprodução da população de E. lucunter na praia de Muro Alto é contínua, compicos sazonais...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{resistance}} to antibiotics has become a serious global problem. Infections that once were easily cured with antibiotics have now become nearly impossible to treat. Thus, there is a desperate need for new antibacterial drugs. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are {{a diverse group of}} compounds. Amongst their unique features are their ability to kill bacteria (often both Gram-positive and Gram-negative) as well as other microorganisms rapidly without toxicity to other cells. AMPs have been suggested as an option for treating bacterial infections where traditional antibiotics have little effect. The overall aim {{of the study was to}} discover and characterise novel AMPs in Echinodermata and Cnidaria, and secondarily to map bioactivities, explore toxicity and perform structure-activity relationship studies. The most potent AMPs were discovered via bioassay-guided purification in the <b>edible</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Echinus esculentus, killing bacteria at low µM-concentrations and fungi at somewhat higher concentrations. The AMPs were homologous to the centrocins and strongylocins of the green <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis and were named EeCentrocins 1 and 2 (dimeric and with the antimicrobial activity located in the heavy chain), Ee 4634 and EeStrongylocin 2. All AMPs were post-translationally modified on all Trp-residues with a bromine in the 6 position. Additional post-translational modifications involved C-terminal amidation on the light chains of EeCentrocins 1 and 2, N-terminal cyclic glutamate on EeCentrocin 2 and disulphide bonds on EeStrongylocin 2. None of the EeCentrocin HCs displayed toxicity to human erythrocytes. Structure-activity relationship studies on EeCentrocin 1 heavy chain (30 amino acids) led to a truncated 12 -mer AMP where Asp 8 and Asn 12 were replaced with Ala and Lys respectively. The AMP displayed potent antimicrobial activities. Additionally, an Ala-scan was performed identifying the two Trp-residues as crucial for activity towards Gram-negative bacteria, whereas the anti-Gram-positive activity was more dependent on the Trp in position two. An AMP in Urticina eques was named -AnmTx Ueq 12 - 1 (short name Ueg 12 - 1) and characterised. This AMP was antibacterial exclusively towards the Gram-positive Corynebacterium glutamicum at 50 µM concentrations. Ueq 12 - 1 was bifunctional as it potentiated the TRPA 1 ion channel in addition to its antibacterial activity. Analgesic activity was furthermore demonstrated in vivo in rats where the peptide reduced licking behaviour on a hot-plate test. The primary sequence of Ueq 12 - 1 appeared non-homologous to any currently known peptides, but the 3 D-structure was somewhat homologous to the defensins...|$|R
40|$|Research and {{development}} in aquaculture has supported the knowledge-based development of the sector over the last decades. In particular, species diversification is playing {{an important role to}} ensure sustainability of the industry and helping to reduce pressure on wild stocks of those aquatic species for which farming technology is still at the early stages. Due to the increasing pressures on more traditional carnivorous marine finfish species (aquafeed reliance on fishmeal and fish oil, environmental impact, market price) low trophic organisms are receiving more attention to provide sustainable alternatives and integrate production activities with the aim of reducing environmental impacts and to provide secondary high value crops. Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) systems are therefore at the forefront of innovation in the industry. Several invertebrate species have been investigated and tested as integral part of IMTA (mussels, oysters, abalone and macroalgae) and echinoderms have also been considered as good candidates for the future development of this technology. In order to allow for a more widespread uptake of integrated aquaculture, several technical and biological challenges need to be overcome, including a reliable supply of juveniles. In recent years, this has prompted investigation on Echiniculture as a whole and on hatchery technologies in particular. This PhD investigated key constraints in <b>edible</b> <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> (Paracentrotus lividus) juvenile production with the aim to improve commercial <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> hatchery outputs. The research firstly focused on larval nutrition (Chapter 3 and 4) and specifically tested the hypothesis that larvae required higher dietary inputs of long chain fatty acids than those provided by Dunaliella tertiolecta, a microalgae species widely used in echinoderm larval rearing. Fatty acid composition of P. lividus eggs, investigated in Chapter 3, supported this hypothesis, which was further confirmed by the results obtained in Chapter 4 where microalgae (Cricosphaera elongata, Pleurochrisis carterae and Tetraselmis suecica) with a more balanced fatty acid profile, in particular richer in long chain fatty acids, were employed. This resulted in a significantly improved larval development and survival. Results also indicated that these alternative microalgae species could be successfully grown without modification of the microalgae production protocols in the hatchery where the experimentation had taken place. The third experimental chapter compared static and flow through systems which provides more stable water quality through constant water exchange and reduces larval handling and associated stress. Results indicated that larval survival was significantly improved by the flow-through system and the need for tank cleaning was reduced (three versus seven times per larval cycle when using flow-through and static rearing systems respectively). However, water quality, based on the parameters assessed (NH 4, PO 4 - 3, NO 2 and NO 3), did not show any significant differences between systems. Reduced handling could have therefore played the most important role in promoting larval survival. Both these trials resulted in a significant 5 to 20...|$|R
40|$|Connectivity between populations {{influences}} {{both their}} dynamics and the genetic structuring of species. In this study, we explored connectivity patterns of a marine species with long-distance dispersal, the <b>edible</b> common <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Paracentrotus lividus, focusing {{mainly on the}} Adriatic-Ionian basins (Central Mediterranean). We applied a multidisciplinary approach integrating population genomics, based on 1, 122 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from 2 b-RAD in 275 samples, with Lagrangian simulations performed with a biophysical model of larval dispersal. We detected genetic homogeneity among eight population samples collected in the focal Adriatic-Ionian area, whereas weak but significant differentiation was found with respect to two samples from the Western Mediterranean (France and Tunisia). This result was not affected by the few putative outlier loci identified in our dataset. Lagrangian simulations found a significant potential for larval exchange among the eight Adriatic-Ionian locations, supporting the hypothesis of connectivity of P. lividus populations in this area. A peculiar pattern emerged from the comparison of our results with those obtained from published P. lividus cytochrome b (cytb) sequences, the latter revealing genetic differentiation in the same geographic area despite a smaller sample size and a lower power to detect differences. The comparison with studies conducted using nuclear markers on other species with similar pelagic larval durations in the same Adriatic-Ionian locations indicates species-specific differences in genetic connectivity patterns and warns against generalizing single-species results to the entire community of rocky shore habitat...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of Ostreopsis cf. ovata, a toxic benthic dinoflagellate {{has increased in}} the North Western Mediterranean Sea, causing health, ecological and economical concerns. In {{order to understand the}} ecological impact on macroinvertebrates, a preliminary study was carried on <b>edible</b> grazers, the <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Paracentrotus lividus and the limpet Patella spp. Their densities were followed toward the abundance of O. cf. ovata. Thus, in 2008, we performed a monthly field survey in scuba-diving in three sites of the North Western Mediterranean Sea (Genoa, Nice and Villefranche-sur-Mer) at the sea surface and at 1 and 3 m depth. Results showed that at 1 m and 3 m depth, the density of P. lividus was not clearly affected by a strong {{development of}} Ostreopsis. Decrease in P. lividus abundance may be due to natural variation or to fishing activities especially in France. Regarding the density of Patella spp., only one significant decrease was observed between July and August 2008 in Genoa. Patella species are living in the interdital zone, we could therefore hypothese that the limpets were intoxicated either by direct ingestion of O. cf ovata by grazing and/or by the toxins released in the surrounding water...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> 'barrens' on shallow temperate rocky reefs is well documented. However {{there has been}} much conjecture about the underlying mechanisms leading to <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> barrens, and relatively little experimentation to test these ideas critically. We conducted a series of manipulative experiments to determine whether predation mortality is an important mechanism structuring populations of the <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> Heliocidaris erythrogramma in Tasmania. Tethered juvenile and adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> experienced much higher rates of mortality inside no-take marine reserves where <b>sea</b> <b>urchin</b> predators were abundant compared to adjacent fished areas where predators were fewer. Mortality of tagged (but not tethered) <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> was also notably higher in marine reserves than in adjacent areas open to fishing. When a range of sizes of <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> was exposed to three sizes of rock lobsters in a caging experiment, juvenile <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> were eaten more frequently than larger <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> by all sizes of rock lobster, but only the largest rock lobsters (N 120 mm CL) were able to consume large adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchins.</b> Tagging (but not tethering) juvenile and adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> in two separate marine reserves indicated that adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> experience higher predation mortality than juveniles, probably because juveniles can shelter in cryptic microhabitat more effectively. In a field experiment in which exposure of <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> to rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) and demersal reef fish predators was manipulated, rock lobsters were shown to be more important than fish as predators of adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> in a marine reserve. We conclude that predators, and particularly rock lobsters, exert significant predation mortality on H. erythrogramma in Tasmanian marine reserves, and that adult <b>sea</b> <b>urchins</b> are more vulnerable than smaller cryptic individuals. Fishing of rock lobsters is likely to reduce an important component of mortality in H. erythrogramma populations...|$|R
