5|$|Banksia speciosa is {{extremely}} sensitive to dieback caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi and numbers in Cape Le Grand and Cape Arid National Parks have been drastically reduced as whole populations of plants have perished after exposure. It is an <b>indicator</b> <b>species</b> {{for the presence}} of the disease. Nursery plants in Italy perished from root and basal stem rot from the pathogen Phytophthora taxon niederhauserii.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis serves an <b>indicator</b> <b>species</b> for river {{monitoring}} (in Germany); {{however the}} spreading populations {{also have a}} high tolerance for degraded habitats. Theodoxus fluviatilis has a large phenotypic plasticity: it was found living on stones and on dead wood in freshwater environments; whereas it lives on stones and on Fucus vesiculosus, Potamogeton spp. and Zostera marina in brackish water in the Baltic Sea. The species {{can also be found}} on aggregates of Mytilus.|$|E
5|$|Banksia sessilis {{is highly}} {{susceptible}} to dieback {{caused by the}} introduced plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soil-borne water mould that causes root rot; {{in fact it is}} so reliably susceptible that it is considered a good <b>indicator</b> <b>species</b> for the presence of the disease. Most highly susceptible species quickly become locally extinct in infected areas, {{and in the absence of}} hosts the disease itself eventually dies out. However, B.sessilis, being an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open ground, often colonises old disease sites. The new colonies are themselves infected, and thus P.cinnamomi survives at these sites indefinitely.|$|E
50|$|The grounds had {{previously}} been the farmland of Marshalland farm and the evidence from OS maps does not show the presence of any old woodland after the mid-eighteenth century. Several orchid species are present {{and a few of}} the <b>indicators</b> <b>species</b> of older woodland. Ivy dominates the ground flora near the Geilsland Road to the extent that almost all other species are eliminated.|$|R
40|$|Presented as {{biological}} indicators, {{the aquatic}} macrophytes, {{according to their}} community and distribution are important elements for water quality determination. In lakes there are many hydro-morphological pressures that {{play an important role}} in the distribution of aquatic macrophytes. The paper presents an overviewof recent literature on species response to hydrological and chemical factors in lakes. The <b>indicators</b> <b>species</b> and their response to pressures as well as adaptation mechanisms are summarized in tables...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEcological optima and {{ranges of}} {{submerged}} macrophytes are, amongst other factors, {{assumed to be}} influenced by ecoregion and flow velocity. In order to test the influence of ecoregion within Europe, <b>species</b> <b>indicator</b> values of three European macrophyte river trophic indices were compared to each other. <b>Species</b> <b>indicator</b> values of the United Kingdom (UK), French and German bioindication methods are significantly correlated with each other. The most obvious difference between the three indicator systems is the number of included <b>indicator</b> taxa. Two <b>species</b> exhibit major differences in indicator values: Callitriche hamulata has a broader ecological amplitude in Germany and France than in the UK, where it is restricted to oligotrophic rivers, while Ranunculus fluitans has a broad ecological amplitude in the UK, whereas the species is restricted to eutrophic rivers in Germany and France. In order to test if current velocity has an influence on macrophyte trophic <b>indicator</b> qualities, <b>species</b> <b>indicator</b> values of a river (Trophic Index of Macrophytes, TIM) and a lake macrophyte trophic index (Macrophyte Index, MI), both of them applicable in Bavaria, Germany, were compared to each other. <b>Species</b> <b>indicator</b> values are significantly correlated. The most important difference is that different species are included in lake and river indicator lists. Only approximately 60 % of the total species are used in both TIM and MI. Three species exhibit a major difference in ecological optima between rivers and lakes: Ranunculus circinatus has a broader ecological amplitude in rivers whereas the species is restricted to eutrophic lakes, Myriophyllum spicatum and Nuphar lutea show the opposite reaction...|$|R
5|$|Extremely {{sensitive}} to dieback caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi, Banksia coccinea is an <b>indicator</b> <b>species</b> {{for the presence}} of the disease. There is no known means of eradicating dieback. Much of the Stirling Range National Park is infested, though Fitzgerald River National Park has been largely spared. Applying phosphite to infested areas has been shown to reduce the mortality rates to around 50%. B. coccinea has shown some symptoms of toxicity to application of phosphite, with some patchy necrosis of leaves, but the plant's uptake of the compound is somewhat lower compared with uptake by other shrub species. Unusually, the symptoms {{do not appear to be}} proportional to exposure levels.|$|E
5|$|Fossils {{from the}} Pleistocene {{suggest that this}} species bred further south in Europe in the cool periods between glaciations than it does now. Its {{sensitivity}} to changing climate {{as well as to}} water table levels and the speed of vegetation growth has led to suggestions that its range is affected by global warming, and the ruff might act as an <b>indicator</b> <b>species</b> for monitoring climate change. Potential threats to this species may also include outbreaks of diseases to which it is susceptible such as influenza, botulism and avian malaria.|$|E
5|$|In North America, {{the fungus}} has been {{recorded}} in North Carolina, Tennessee, New York, Michigan, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, California, Virginia, and South Dakota. In Canada, {{it has been found}} in Ontario. Smith noted that collections from Michigan are likely to be found on old hemlock knots lying in the soil, where it usually fruits singly; it tends to grow in clusters on logs and stumps. In Europe, it {{has been recorded}} from Britain, Scotland, the Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, and Turkey. In the UK, the fungus is commonly found in Caledonian pine woods, and it is considered an <b>indicator</b> <b>species</b> for that habitat type.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} habitat specificity, {{many species of}} beetles have been {{suggested}} as suitable as indicators, their presence, numbers, or absence providing a measure of habitat quality. Predatory beetles such as the tiger beetles (Cicindelidae) have found scientific use as an indicator taxon for measuring regional patterns of biodiversity. They are suitable for this as their taxonomy is stable; their life history is well described; they are large and simple to observe when visiting a site; they occur {{around the world in}} many habitats, with species specialised to particular habitats; and their occurrence by species accurately indicates other species, both vertebrate and invertebrate. According to the habitats, many other groups such as the rove beetles in human-modified habitats, dung beetles in savannas and saproxylic beetles in forests have been suggested as potential <b>indicator</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late 2013, a {{plan was}} {{proposed}} for salvage logging approximately 30,000 acres (120km2) of the Rim Fire. The snag forest habitat of forest-killed trees {{is home to}} a wide variety of wildlife, some of which are management <b>indicator</b> <b>species.</b> Many scientists and conservation groups opposed the logging plan, contending that the removal of trees from this area would harm species such as black-backed woodpeckers and affect other cavity-nesting birds that follow in the wake of the woodpeckers. Other species of wildlife were also considered be at risk from salvage logging, such as frogs that inhabit forested streams and deer. Native plants and basic ecological succession of the forest are also reportedly harmed by salvage logging. However, some environmental groups endorsed the salvage logging plan.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers {{sometimes}} {{cause problems}} when they raid fruit crops, but their foraging activities are mostly beneficial as they control forest insect pests {{such as the}} woodboring beetles that create galleries behind the bark and can kill trees. They also eat ants, which may be tending sap-sucking pests such as mealybugs, {{as is the case}} with the rufous woodpecker in coffee plantations in India. Woodpeckers can serve as <b>indicator</b> <b>species,</b> demonstrating the quality of the habitat. Their hole-making abilities make their presence in an area an important part of the ecosystem, because these cavities are used for breeding and roosting by many bird species that are unable to excavate their own holes, as well as being used by various mammals and invertebrates.|$|E
50|$|The Alpine Lakes Wilderness is {{considered}} by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency {{to be in the}} North Cascades ecoregion, dominated by forests, subalpine, and alpine ecozones. <b>Indicator</b> tree <b>species</b> of individual zones include the Western Hemlock, Pacific Silver Fir, Subalpine Mountain Hemlock, Subalpine Fir, and Grand Fir/Douglas Fir.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cemetery}} is also {{listed as}} a City Wildlife Site, containing many <b>indicator</b> plant <b>species</b> for undisturbed neutral/calcareous grassland amongst the 110+ species identified. At least 35 species of bird, 23 species of butterflies and several species of mammal have also been reported, including the European dormouse and weasel.|$|R
5000|$|In {{biodiversity}} studies, the checkerboard score or C-score is {{a statistic}} which determines the randomness {{of the distribution}} of two or more species through a collection of biomes. The statistic, first published by Stone and Roberts in 1990, expands on the earlier work of Diamond that defined a notion of [...] "checkerboard distributions" [...] as an <b>indicator</b> of <b>species</b> competition.|$|R
5|$|Bluebells are {{a species}} of {{deciduous}} woodland over much of their range, flowering and leafing early before the canopy closes in late spring. They may also be found growing under bracken or Japanese knotweed, perennial plants which also form stands with a dense summer canopy. They are most successful on slightly acid soils; the same niche in alkaline conditions may be occupied by other species such as Mercurialis perennis. As a species adapted to woodlands, the young shoots are able to penetrate through {{a thick layer of}} leaf litter, and bluebells are often used as an <b>indicator</b> <b>species</b> to identify ancient woodland. Bluebells are also frequently found in hedgerows, and in the west of their range they can be found growing in open habitats, including coastal meadows. Bluebell flowers are rich in pollen and nectar, and are chiefly pollinated by bumblebees, although they are also visited by various other insects. They are a host species for the parasitic fungus Uromyces muscari, which causes bluebell rust. The ability of H.non-scripta to take up phosphorus from the soil is greatly enhanced by the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizae in its roots.|$|E
5|$|Of the 28 {{fish species}} {{present in the}} forest, 11 are not native and have been {{introduced}} by humans. Rainbow trout, chinook salmon, westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, and mountain whitefish are all native {{to some of the}} forest's waterways, while brook trout are a common invasive species that compete with the forest's salmonids. The forest's management <b>indicator</b> <b>species</b> is bull trout because they are sensitive to habitat changes and depend on specific habitat conditions. Sockeye salmon are native to the Salmon River watershed {{in the northern part of}} the forest, but dam construction on the Columbia and Snake rivers has hampered the migration of this anadromous fish and caused its population to collapse. Warm Lake supports the forest's only native population of Kokanee salmon, the resident (non-migratory) form of sockeye salmon. However, due to introductions by humans, Anderson Ranch, Arrowrock, Lucky Peak, and Deadwood reservoirs now support populations of Kokanee salmon. To provide additional recreational fishing opportunities, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game stocks several of the forest's waterways with rainbow trout, while reservoirs are also stocked with Kokanee or chinook salmon and Lake Cascade is stocked with coho salmon and steelhead, the anadromous form of rainbow trout.|$|E

50|$|Bostra <b>indicator</b> is a <b>species</b> of snout moth in {{the genus}} Bostra. It was {{described}} by Walker in 1864. It is found in China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia and India.|$|R
50|$|The equation, {{derived from}} the acidity constant, states that when pH equals the pKa value of the <b>indicator,</b> both <b>species</b> are present in a 1:1 ratio. If pH is above the pKa value, the {{concentration}} of the conjugate base {{is greater than the}} concentration of the acid, and the color associated with the conjugate base dominates. If pH is below the pKa value, the converse is true.|$|R
50|$|The forest buzzard, as {{its name}} implies, inhabits {{evergreen}} woodlands, including introduced eucalyptus and pines, whereas the steppe buzzard prefers more open habitats. However, habitat alone {{is not a good}} <b>indicator</b> for these <b>species.</b>|$|R
25|$|Predominant {{tree species}} are pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), European {{hornbeam}} (Carpinus betuloides), silver birch (Betula pendula) and European holly (Ilex aquifolium). <b>Indicator</b> <b>species</b> of long-uninterrupted woodland include service-tree (Sorbus torminalis) butcher's-broom (Ruscus aculeatus) and drooping sedge (Carex pendula) A {{wide range of}} animals are found, including fallow deer (Dama dama), muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) and European adder (Vipera berus).|$|E
25|$|The {{ecology of}} the area can be {{understood}} by following a west-to-east line {{at the southern end}} of the North Cascades, at approximately 47.5 degrees north. As the line passes through the Cascade range, it passes through a number of ecoregions, first getting higher and colder, then getting warmer, yet drier. Each of these component ecoregions can be described by either a tree <b>indicator</b> <b>species,</b> or by a lack of trees: western hemlock, Pacific silver fir, subalpine mountain hemlock, alpine, subalpine fir, and grand fir/Douglas fir.|$|E
25|$|With its {{combination}} of grassland, riparian habitat, coulees and badlands, the Milk River Natural Area and Kennedy Coulee Ecological Reserve host {{a variety of}} amphibians and reptiles, including rare northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens), listed as threatened in Alberta and both a Canadian species at risk (SARA) and Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) species of special concern, as well as prairie rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis), bullsnake (Pituophis catenifer sayi), western hognose snake (Heterodon nasicus), western painted turtle (Chrysemys picta), garter snake (Thamnophis radix), and the nationally and provincially endangered short-horned lizard (Phrynosoma douglassi), {{which is at the}} northern limit of its geographical range here. The northern leopard frog and prairie rattlesnake in particular are <b>indicator</b> <b>species</b> of the ecological health of the Milk River watershed.|$|E
50|$|Two {{specimens}} of Hyphalosaurus {{have been described}} with clear impressions of the skin. One specimen represents H. lingyuanensis, and the other (with clearer impressions) cannot be assigned to a species because part of the neck (the length {{of which is a}} key <b>indicator</b> of <b>species)</b> was destroyed when fossil dealers grafted a skull from a different specimen onto the slab. However, both specimens show nearly identical patterns of scales.|$|R
40|$|Algological {{monitoring}} in Hungary {{started in}} the 1960 s – 1970 s and its technical guidelines were elaborated by 1984. Streams and rivers are monitored at 155 sampling stations by a sampling frequency of 4 - 52 /year. Based on trophic scales (chlorophyll-a, algal numbers) trophic states are established. A saprobic classification is made according {{to the list of}} saprobic <b>indicators</b> <b>species.</b> The paper summarizes the opinions of many Hungarian algologists involved in monitoring about the advantages and pitfalls of the existing monitoring system. Since the authors’ conviction is that computer problems and methods for handling large databases and the exploration of their information content will become one of the major difficulties in connection with algological monitoring, a pilot study was made on an already existing databank. The outcome of this study was that, however much the original single data-sets were different, large databanks can be useful in searching for variables {{that can be used for}} monitoring water quality. simple variables (e. g. the ratio of diatoms to non-diatoms) and multivariate methods can be applied with a godd measure of success...|$|R

25|$|The Sundarbans flora is characterised by the {{abundance}} of sundari (Heritiera fomes), gewa (Excoecaria agallocha), goran (Ceriops decandra) and keora (Sonneratia apetala) all of which occur prominently throughout the area. The characteristic tree of the forest is the sundari (Heritiera littoralis), from which {{the name of the}} forest had probably been derived. It yields a hard wood, used for building houses and making boats, furniture and other things. New forest accretions is often conspicuously dominated by keora (Sonneratia apetala) and tidal forests. It is an <b>indicator</b> <b>species</b> for newly accreted mudbanks and is an important species for wildlife, especially spotted deer (Axis axis). There is abundance of dhundul or passur (Xylocarpus granatum) and kankra (Bruguiera gymnorhiza) though distribution is discontinuous. Among palms, Poresia coaractata, Myriostachya wightiana and golpata (Nypa fruticans), and among grasses spear grass (Imperata cylindrica) and khagra (Phragmites karka) are well distributed.|$|E
25|$|Species of the clade Thecosomata {{produce a}} fragile {{external}} calcium carbonate shell, which {{could serve as}} a ballast enabling large vertical migrations and as a protection against predators. The aragonitic composition of the shell makes it very sensitive to dissolution. Aragonite is a metastable form of calcium carbonate and it is more soluble in seawater than calcite. Because of its highly soluble aragonite shell and polar distribution, Limacina helicina {{may be one of the}} first organisms affected by ocean acidification, and it is therefore a key <b>indicator</b> <b>species</b> of this process. As a key indicator of the acidification process, and a major component of polar ecosystems, Limacina helicina has become a focus for acidification research. Based on labolatory experiments, they are able to precipitate calcium carbonate at low aragonite saturation state. Limacina helicina seems to be relatively more resilient to elevated concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) than other aragonitic organisms such as corals. Labolatory experiments results support the current concern for the future of Arctic pteropods, as the production of their shell appears to be very sensitive to decreased pH. A decline of pteropod populations would likely cause dramatic changes to various pelagic ecosystems. Shelled pteropods also play a geochemical role in carbon cycle in the oceans, as they contribute to the export of calcium carbonate and can represent a major component of the carbon transport to the deep ocean.|$|E

40|$|Aims Ejin Desert Oasis is {{a typical}} arid oasis in the Hexi {{corridor}} of northwestern and northern China. Water resources in the area have changed since 2000. Our objective was to classify the plant community types and determine the relationship between vegetation and environmental factors in order to evaluate the influence of waterregulation on vegetation in this region. Methods We obtained data on 29 plant species from 151 study plots of natural vegetation of the Ejin Desert Oasis and classified the plant communities by two-way <b>indicators</b> <b>species</b> analysis (TWINSPAN) and correlated them with six groundwater environmental variables using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) ordinations. Important findings Six plant associations were identified. The main factor correlated to their distribution was groundwater depth, which had more influence {{on the distribution of}} plant species and vegetation than other variables because change of groundwater depth leads to changes in both salinity and mineralization. The first ordination axis was correlated with the gradient of groundwater depth, and the second axis was correlated with pH. Compared with other areas, the scarcity of plant species and the differentiation of plant communities were obvious...|$|R
