5|$|X. bracteatum {{is easy to}} grow {{both from}} seeds and from cuttings, {{although}} named cultivars only grow true from cuttings. Plants benefit from pruning of old growth in winter to allow for new growth in spring. <b>Dead-heading,</b> or pruning off old flower heads, promotes the production of more flowers. Fresh seeds germinate in 3 to 20days and require no special treatment. Plants grow best in acid, well-aerated soils of pH5.5 to 6.3, {{with low levels of}} phosphorus. They are sensitive to iron deficiency, which presents as yellowing (chlorosis) of the youngest leaves while the leaf veins remain green.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Nanoparticles (NPs) {{are widely}} studied for {{biomedical}} applications. Understanding interactions between NPs and biomolecules or cells {{has yet to}} be achieved. Here we present a novel in vivo method to study interactions between NPs and the nervous system of the discoid or false <b>dead-head</b> roach, Blaberus discoidalis. The aims of this study were to present a new and effective method to observe NPs in vivo that opens the door to new methods of study to observe the interactions between NPs and biological systems and to present an inexpensive and easy-to-handle biological system. Results Negatively charged gold nanoparticles (nAuNPs) of 50 nm in diameter were injected into the central nervous system (CNS) of the insect. By using such a cost effective method, we were able to characterize nAuNPs and to analyze their interactions with a biological system. It showed that the charged particles affected the insect's locomotion. The nAuNPs affected the insect's behavior but had no major impacts on the life expectancy of the cockroach after two months of observation. This was apparently due to the encapsulation of nAuNPs inside the insect's brain. Based on cockroach's daily activity, we believed that the encapsulation occurred in the first 17 days. Conclusions The method proposed here is an inexpensive and reliable way of observing the response of biological systems to nanoparticles in-vivo. It opens new windows to further understand how nanoparticles affect neural communication by monitoring insect activity and locomotion. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative dynamic route management model for direct on-demand transportation services. In these scenarios, a carrier is hired for a transportation service from an origin to a destination point and then released. Subsequently, {{being in the}} off-hire condition, the carrier can wait in the destination point or move towards another loading dock. The aim of the approach is to identify the best route and the optimal waiting strategy of the carrier while in the off-hire condition, minimizing the <b>dead-head</b> movement costs and maximizing the expected profit originating from the forecasted demand. This model has been tested in the industry of the oil tankers fleet. So far this problem has been partially fronted with models which {{are focused on the}} evaluation of each loading dock profitability, lacking however to consider the opportunity of a continuous-moves routing in the off-hire condition. This analysis defines instead a dynamic strategy which estimates the future demand and is continuously updated by the other carriers movements and by the variation in the scenario. A set of Deviation Points and Waiting Areas are identified respectively as alternatives for the carrier off-hire movements and as areas in which the carrier has the possibility to stop and wait for a new order. These points are determined on a geographical map on behalf of statistical and economical considerations. Time constraints are also considered, especially in terms of Time Windows in which the carrier has to react to the demand and to reach the origin of the order...|$|E
5000|$|Plants {{prefer a}} warm and sunny {{position}} and rich soil, although they tolerate poor soil, salt or drought well. Modern cultivars flower continuously when watered and fertilised well, and <b>dead-heading</b> is not necessary, {{because they do not}} set seed easily. If planted in a container, soil should be prevented from drying out completely. If they do, the plants will go into [...] "sleep mode" [...] and survive the period of drought, but they will abort their flower buds and not easily come back into flower. Moreover, roots are relatively susceptible to rotting if watered too profusely after the dry period.|$|R
50|$|The {{design and}} {{operation}} {{was based on}} the simplest of things, which in effect made them very reliable. The locomotive was operated by design from the outside (side of engine) and wasn't equipped with a dead man device to stop the locomotive automatically in case of incapacity of the operator. There were two manual brakes: a handle and a foot brake. As the handle could be moved by in-train forces while <b>dead-heading</b> it was required to be fixed by a nut and bolt. Upon taking the locomotive into service again, it was necessary to loosen the nut and bolt. In some cases this was forgotten and the result was that the operator couldn't brake; many Siks have suffered collision damage due to this.|$|R
50|$|There are thick {{groves of}} trees {{adjacent}} to the sand, which results in chunks of timber from fallen trees on the beach. The mostly unaltered Hoh River, toward {{the south end of}} the park, discharges large amounts of naturally eroded timber and other drift, which moves north, enriching the beaches. The removal of driftwood - logs, <b>dead-heads,</b> tops and root-wads from streams and beaches was a major domestication measure across North America. Even today driftwood deposits form a commanding presence, biologically as well as visually, giving a taste of the original condition of the beach viewable to some extent in early photos. Drift-material often comes from a considerable distance; the Columbia River formerly contributed huge amounts to the Northwest Pacific coasts.|$|R
40|$|Funded by the Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management, EM- 31, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{partnered with}} SpinTek Filtration{trademark} {{to develop a}} filter disk that would {{withstand}} a reverse pressure or flow during operation of the rotary microfilter. The ability to withstand a reverse pressure and flow eliminates a potential accident scenario that could have resulted in damage to the filter membranes. While the original welded filter disks {{have been shown to}} withstand and reverse pressure/flow in the static condition, the filter disk design discussed in this report will allow a reverse pressure/flow while the disks are rotating. In addition, the laminated disk increases the flexibility during filter startup and cleaning operations. The new filter disk developed by SRNL and SpinTek is manufactured with a more open structure significantly reducing internal flow restrictions in the disk. The prototype was tested at the University of Maryland and demonstrated to withstand the reverse pressure due to the centrifugal action of the rotary filter. The tested water flux of the disk was demonstrated to be 1. 34 gpm in a single disk test. By comparison, the water flux of the current disk was 0. 49 gpm per disk during a 25 disk test. The disk also demonstrated rejection of solids by filtering a 5 wt % Strontium Carbonate slurry with a filtrate clarity of less the 1. 4 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) throughout the two hour test. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) has been working with SpinTek Filtration{trademark} to adapt the rotary microfilter for radioactive service in the Department of Energy (DOE) Complex. One potential weakness is the loose nature of the membrane on the filter disks. The current disk is constructed by welding the membrane at {{the outer edge of the}} disk. The seal for the center of the membrane is accomplished by an o-ring in compression for the assembled stack. The remainder of the membrane is free floating on the disk. This construction requires that a positive pressure be applied to the rotary filter tank to prevent the membrane from rising from the disk structure and potentially contacting the filter turbulence promoter. In addition, one accident scenario is a reverse flow through the filtrate line due to mis-alignment of valves resulting in the membrane rising from the disk structure. The structural integrity of the current disk has been investigated, and shown that the disk can withstand a significant reverse pressure in a static condition. However, the disk will likely incur damage if the filter stack is rotated during a reverse pressure. The development of a laminated disk would have several significant benefits for the operation of the rotary filter including the prevention of a compromise in filter disk integrity during a reverse flow accident, increasing operational flexibility, and increasing the self cleaning ability of the filter. A laminated disk would allow the filter rotor operation prior to a positive pressure in the filter tank. This would prevent the initial <b>dead-head</b> of the filter and prevent the resulting initial filter cake buildup. The laminated disk would allow rotor operation with cleaning fluid, eliminating the need for a recirculation pump. Additionally, a laminated disk would allow a reverse flow of fluid through the membrane pores removing trapped particles...|$|E

40|$|How to {{deal with}} a {{disruption}} is a question railway companies face on a daily basis. This thesis focusses on the subject how to handle a disruption such that the passenger service is upheld as much as possible. The current mathematical models for disruption management can not yet be applied in practice, because several important practical considerations are not taken into account. In this thesis several models are presented which take important practical details into account: (1) Creating a macroscopic global feasible solution for all three resource schedules, instead of focussing on one individual resource schedule. (2) Scheduled maintenance appointments required by certain rolling stock units are included while rescheduling. (3) <b>Dead-heading</b> trips to transfer rolling stock units from stations with a surplus of inventory to stations with a shortage of inventory. (4) Adjusted passenger demand, the passenger demand is not static, but depends on the capacity appointed to the previous trips. Finally, (5) Checking whether a rolling stock circulation is feasible with respect to the available depot tracks (the shunting yard) within a station. We make use of different techniques to solve the models, for instance, mixed integer linear programming, column generation, constraint programming, and heuristic models are used in this thesis. The results demonstrate that these five practical considerations can be taken into account in the disruption management models...|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} of e-commerce and information communication technologies by carriers has generated new business and operational paradigms. Consequently, collaboration between carriers {{has emerged as}} a deployable alternative for small- to medium-sized less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers to improve fleet usage. This paper addresses a single carrier collaboration problem (SCCP) in which an LTL carrier of interest seeks to collaborate with other carriers by acquiring capacity to service excess demand. The SCCP problem is addressed from a static (planning) perspective to gain insights on the potential of the collaboration concept for carriers, and its ability to alleviate the effects of increased fuel prices. The study also explores the impact of the degree of collaboration represented by the collaborative discount rate on the carrier of interest. The collaborative strategies are compared to the non-collaboration option represented by a short-term leasing strategy, and the relative benefits of collaboration are computed. Single and multiple product SCCP problems are formulated as binary (0 - 1) multi-commodity minimum cost flow problems and are solved using the branch-and-cut algorithm. Experiments are conducted for two transfer cost policies to illustrate insights on: the computational performance under varying factors, the effects of different degrees of collaboration, and the impacts of energy costs on the potential for collaboration. The results illustrate that a higher degree of collaboration leads to increased benefits for the carrier of interest and reduced <b>dead-heading</b> for the collaborating carriers. Collaboration also can be critical for the survival of the small- to medium-sized LTL carriers as energy prices escalate given the small industry-wide profit margins...|$|R

To her simple experience, when Bartley told how magnificently the reporters had been accommodated, at some civic or commercial or professional banquet, with a table of their own, where they were served with all the wines and courses, {{he seemed to have}} been one of the principal guests, and her fear was that his head should be turned by his honors. But at the bottom of her heart, though she enjoyed the brilliancy of Bartley's present life, she did not think his occupation comparable to the law in dignity. Bartley called himself a journalist now, but his newspaper connection still identified him in her mind with those country editors of whom she had always heard her father speak with such contempt: men dedicated to poverty and the despite of all the local notables who used them. She could not shake off the old feeling of degradation, even when she heard Bartley and some of his fellow-journalists talking in their boastfulest vein of the sovereign character of journalism; and she secretly resolved never to relinquish her purpose of having him a lawyer. Till he was fairly this, in regular and prosperous practice, she knew that she should not have shown her father that she was right in marrying Bartley.|$|R
