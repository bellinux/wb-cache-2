40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} the analysis of the transient dynamic response of a bladed <b>disk</b> on a <b>flexible</b> rotor. The rotating <b>flexible</b> bladed <b>disk</b> is considered as a module in a complete turbine engine structure.

The FBD is coupled inertially and gyroscopically to its rotor support, and indirectly through connecting elements, to the adjacent rotor and/or other supporting structures. Incorporated in the basic Turbine Engine Transient Response Analysis program (TETRA), the FBD module is demonstrated with a two-rotor model where the FBD can be excited into resonance by an unbalance in the adjacent rotor and at a frequency equal to the differential rotor speed.

Further work {{led to the}} development and publication in 1984 of Standard ECMA- 91 which is applicable to all <b>flexible</b> <b>disk</b> cartridges, in particular to those with FM recording on the Index Cylinder. For many purposes this Standard ECMA- 91 provides a satisfactory data interchange pathway between different types of information-processing systems. However, it imposes some restrictions on the operation of a system as follows: a) Each individual file must be recorded on the disk in a sequential, “batch-processing ” mode. After a set of files has been recorded on the disk, a file cannot be extended beyond its pre-determined length. It is common practice in small systems for the user to inter-act continuously with the system to update files. Files having a suitable structure for this purpose are not within the provisions of ECMA- 91. It is necessary for the interchange cartridge to be created by an “export ” copy process from the application’s files, after the application has terminated. A similar “import ” process is required in the receiving system. b) Limitations on the number of file labels permitted on an inter-change FDC prevents the full use of the disk space if the average size of files is significantly less than, say 20 Kbytes. For conventional data processing purposes this is mostly satisfactory. However, the file size typically encountered in text processing and small single-user systems are very much smaller and would lead to very inefficient use of the disk space...|$|E

To eliminate the vibration due to an unwanted flexible mode, input shaping is used to alter the time-optimal velocity phase-plane profile that moves the third-order nonflexible dynamics from rest to rest. Because the closed-form solution for the time-optimal control of the third-order nonflexible dynamics is not known, the shaped time-optimal velocity phase-plane profiles are derived numerically. By using a curve-fit polynomial to approximate these shaped timeoptimal velocity phase-plane profiles, we obtain an analytical expression for the STOS control.

40|$|The {{vibrations}} of thin <b>flexible</b> <b>disks</b> rotating in {{the surrounding}} air pose significant challenges {{in the design of}} high-speed rotating disk systems especially in hard disk drives and optical storage media. In most such applications, the disk vibrations couple to the acoustic oscillations of the surrounding enclosed fluid. ^ This thesis explains theoretically and experimentally the vibrations and dynamic stability of disks rotating in enclosed compressible fluids. This system is modeled using a rotating Kirchhoff plate for the disk and using the wave equation for the surrounding compressible fluid. The model includes the effects of a radial clearance, symmetric positioning, bulk rotating fluid flow, and damping. The discretized coupled equations of the system are cast in the compact form of a gyroscopic system. ^ For the stationary disk in a fluid filled enclosure, in-phase and out-of-phase acoustic modes coexist. Structure-acoustic eigenvalue veering phenomena also arise. For the rotating disk system, coupled structure-acoustic traveling waves destabilize through mode coalescence leading to flutter instability. A detailed investigation of the effects of dissipation arising from acoustic and disk damping predicts previously unknown instability mechanisms for this system. ^ In the presence of a radial clearance, the coupled rotating disk system exhibits qualitatively the same instability mechanisms, however the mode coalescence instability occurs at slightly higher speeds. The asymmetric positioning of the rotating disk in the enclosure does not change the flutter mechanisms and modifies very slightly the flutter speed. Bulk rotating fluid flow splits the acoustic oscillations into forward and backward modes. The effects of rotating damping arising from fluid viscosity are also analyzed. ^ Finally, experiments are performed on a high-speed SpinStand with a specially designed enclosure. Several disk materials are tested, and both disk and acoustic oscillations in the enclosure are monitored at several locations and over a wide range of speeds. Several observed phenomena correlate well to the theoretical predictions. Some experimentally observed phenomena are not predicted in the present theoretical model and their investigation is recommended as topics for future studies. ...|$|R
