Therefore, in order to breathe in the same amount of oxygen per minute, the person has to inhale a proportionately greater volume of air per minute at altitude than at sea level.

25|$|The {{increase}} in respiration rate {{from the low}} range to the high range is sudden and occurs in response to hyperthermia. Birds lack sweat glands, so when placed under stress due to heat, they heavily rely upon increased evaporation from the respiratory system for heat transfer. This rise in respiration rate however is not necessarily associated with a greater rate of oxygen consumption. Therefore, unlike other birds, the common ostrich is able to dissipate heat through panting without experiencing respiratory alkalosis by modifying ventilation of the respiratory medium. During <b>hyperpnea</b> ostriches pant at a respiratory rate of 40–60 cycles per minute, versus their resting rate of 6–12 cycles per minute. Hot, dry and moisture lacking properties of the common ostrich respiratory medium affects oxygen's diffusion rate (Henry's Law).|$|E

MSNA (peroneal microneurography), arterial blood pressure (Finapres finger monitor), and tidal volume (VT) were recorded continuously in six normal subjects and four heart-lung transplant patients during: 1) spontaneous air breathing; 2) increased FiCO 2; 3) voluntary augmentation ofVT with and without inspiratory resistance; and 4) positive pressure, passive mechanical ventilation. During conditions 3 and 4, which were performed under isocapnic conditions with a high MSNA background (either high resting activity or nonhypotensive lower body suction), subjects breathed at control or elevated VT with normal or prolonged inspiratory time (TI); breathing frequency was 12 breaths per minute.

2500|$|All of {{the above}} {{influences}} of low atmospheric pressures on breathing are accommodated primarily by breathing deeper and faster (<b>hyperpnea).</b> [...] The exact degree of <b>hyperpnea</b> {{is determined by the}} blood gas homeostat, which regulates the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This homeostat prioritizes the regulation of the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide over that of oxygen at sea level. That is to say, at sea level the arterial partial pressure of CO2 is maintained at very close to 5.3kPa (or 40mmHg) under a wide range of circumstances, {{at the expense of the}} arterial partial pressure of O2, which is allowed to vary within a very wide range of values, before eliciting a corrective ventilatory response. [...] However, when the atmospheric pressure (and therefore the partial pressure of O2 in the ambient air) falls to below 50-75% of its value at sea level, oxygen homeostasis is given priority over carbon dioxide homeostasis. This switch-over occurs at an elevation of about 2500m (or about 8000ft). If this switch occurs relatively abruptly, the <b>hyperpnea</b> at high altitude will cause a severe fall in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, with a consequent rise in the pH of the arterial plasma. This is one contributor to high altitude sickness. On the other hand, if the switch to oxygen homeostasis is incomplete, then hypoxia may complicate the clinical picture with potentially fatal results.|$|E
2500|$|During heavy {{breathing}} (<b>hyperpnea),</b> as, for instance, during exercise, inhalation is {{brought about by}} a more powerful and greater excursion of the contracting diaphragm than at rest (Fig. 8).

These accessory muscles of inhalation are muscles that extend from the cervical vertebrae and base of the skull to the upper ribs and sternum, sometimes through an intermediary attachment to the clavicles. When they contract the rib cage's internal volume is increased to a far greater extent than can be achieved by contraction of the intercostal muscles alone. Seen from outside the body the lifting of the clavicles during strenuous or labored inhalation is sometimes called clavicular breathing, seen especially during asthma attacks and in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.|$|E
5000|$|Tachypnea is {{sometimes}} distinguished from <b>hyperpnea</b> when tachypnea is meant as rapid and shallow breaths, whereas <b>hyperpnea</b> is meant as rapid and deep breaths. This distinction {{is not always}} followed; the words can be synonymous. Similarly, some speakers maintain a distinction between <b>hyperpnea</b> and hyperventilation, whereby in <b>hyperpnea,</b> the increased breathing rate is desirable as it meets the metabolic needs of the body, but in hyperventilation, the rate of ventilation is inappropriate for the body's needs (except in metabolic acidosis, when [...] needs to be breathed off). The resulting decrease in [...] concentration results in the typical symptoms of light-headedness, tingling in peripheries, visual disturbances etc., whereas in <b>hyperpnea</b> in the contradistinguished sense, there are generally no such symptoms.

50|$|In pure central {{sleep apnea}} or Cheyne-Stokes respiration, the brain's {{respiratory}} control centers are imbalanced during sleep. Blood levels of carbon dioxide, and the neurological feedback mechanism that monitors them, do not react {{quickly enough to}} maintain an even respiratory rate, with the entire system cycling between apnea and <b>hyperpnea,</b> even during wakefulness. The sleeper stops breathing and then starts again. There is no effort made to breathe during the pause in breathing: there are no chest movements and no struggling. After the episode of apnea, breathing may be faster (<b>hyperpnea)</b> {{for a period of}} time, a compensatory mechanism to blow off retained waste gases and absorb more oxygen.|$|E
50|$|Other {{breathing}} disorders include {{shortness of}} breath (dyspnea), stridor, apnea, sleep apnea (most commonly obstructive sleep apnea), mouth breathing, and snoring. Many conditions are associated with obstructed airways. Hypopnea is the technical term used to describe physiological (i.e. normal) slow and shallow breathing; <b>hyperpnea</b> is the technical term used to describe fast and deep breathing brought on by physiological activities like exercise. The terms hypoventilation and hyperventilation also refer to shallow breathing and fast and deep breathing respectively, but under inappropriate circumstances or disease. However, this distinction (between, for instance, <b>hyperpnea</b> and hyperventilation) is not always adhered to, so that these terms are frequently used interchangeably.|$|E

50|$|Brain {{control of}} {{exhalation}} {{can be broken}} down into voluntary control and involuntary control. During voluntary exhalation, air is held in the lungs and released at a fixed rate.

50|$|A third {{paradigm}} is: tachypnea is abnormally rapid respiration (though {{some may}} argue this is inaccurate as breathing differs from respiration), hyperventilation is increased rate or {{depth of respiration}} to abnormal levels causing decreased levels of blood carbon dioxide and <b>hyperpnea</b> is any increase in breathing rate or depth that is not normal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyperpnea</b> or hyperpnoea is {{increased}} depth {{and rate of}} breathing.

50|$|Some {{describe}} tachypnea as any rapid breathing.

5000|$|Cheyne-Stokes {{respiration}} [...] is {{an abnormal}} pattern of breathing characterized by progressively deeper and sometimes faster breathing, {{followed by a}} gradual decrease that results in a temporary stop in breathing called an apnea.

5000|$|The venom of Tityus serrulatus is {{the most}} potent of the toxins from the species (Clemente, Rossoni et al. 1999).

The identification of TsTX-I as a potent component of T. serrulatus venom characterized it as the major and main neurotoxin from this venom (Correa, Sampaio et al. 1997).Poisoning effects in man evoked by T. serrulatus venom are sialorrhea, lacrimation and rhinorrhea. (Clemente, Rossoni et al. 1999) and acute pancreatitis (Correa, Sampaio et al. 1997). Catecholamines by the adrenal glands and postganglionic nerve terminals and Ach by ganglions and postganglionic nerve terminals are released when the poison strikes. Also other neurotransmitters are released by the whole venom and isolated toxins (Correa, Sampaio et al. 1997).In rats, the Tityustoxin caused dramatic effects on the circulatory and respiratory systems, consisting of hypotension, tachypnea, <b>hyperpnea,</b> ataxic and gasping breathing. Following these initial effects, 5 or 10 µg of TsTX induced hypertension and <b>hyperpnea.</b> The largest dose produced apnea and death about 70 min later (Lima and Freire-Maia 1977).|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the signs}} and {{symptoms}} of the Joubert syndrome appear very early in infancy with most children showing delays in gross motor milestones. Although other signs and symptoms vary widely from individual to individual, they generally fall under the hallmark of cerebellum involvement or in this case, lack thereof.

5000|$|In pure central sleep apnea, the brain's {{respiratory}} control centers, {{located in}} the region of the human brain known as the pre-Botzinger complex, are imbalanced during sleep and fail to give the signal to inhale, causing the individual to miss one or more cycles of breathing. The neurological feedback mechanism that monitors blood levels of carbon dioxide and in turn stimulates respiration fails to react quickly enough to maintain an even respiratory rate, allowing the entire respiratory system to cycle between apnea and <b>hyperpnea,</b> even for a brief time following an awakening during a breathing pause. The sleeper stops breathing for up to two minutes and then starts again. [...] There is no effort made to breathe during the pause in breathing: there are no chest movements and no muscular struggling, although when awakening occurs {{in the middle of a}} pause, the inability to immediately operate the breathing muscles often results in cognitive struggle accompanied by a feeling of panic exacerbated by the feeling associated with excessive blood CO2 levels. Even in severe cases of central sleep apnea, however, the effects almost always result in pauses that make breathing irregular rather than cause the total cessation of breathing over the medium term. After the episode of apnea, breathing may be faster and/or more intense (<b>hyperpnea)</b> for a period of time, a compensatory mechanism to blow off retained waste gases, absorb more oxygen, and, when voluntary, enable a return to normal instinctive breathing patterns by restoring oxygen to the breathing muscles themselves.|$|E
5000|$|During heavy {{breathing}} (<b>hyperpnea)</b> as, for instance, during exercise, exhalation is {{brought about by}} relaxation of all the muscles of inhalation, (in {{the same way as}} at rest), but, in addition, the abdominal muscles, instead of being passive, now contract strongly causing the rib cage to be pulled downwards (front and sides). This not only decreases the size of the rib cage, but also pushes the abdominal organs upwards against the diaphragm which consequently bulges deeply into the thorax. The end-exhalatory lung volume is now less air than the resting [...] "functional residual capacity". However, in a normal mammal, the lungs cannot be emptied completely.

The initial symptoms of CNH include a low arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, a high or normal arterial partial pressure of oxygen, high arterial pH, and tachypnea. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide has been noted by Yushi et al. to drop as low as 6.7 mmHg, while oxygen saturation remains at 99-100%. Respiratory alkalosis is induced in people affected with CNH, which stimulates the <b>hyperpnea</b> to attempt to compensate the rise of the blood’s pH. Some of the reported cases of CNH claim alkaline cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). However, not all of the cases experience this effect and other cases of CNH have a local increase in the pH surrounding the tumor that causes the condition. The hyperventilation of CNH patients persists during sleep. Those affected {{have been observed}} to not be able to voluntarily control their breathing in order to slow it down and the hyperventilation is predominantly controlled by the diaphragm.|$|E
50|$|The alveoli {{are open}} (via the airways) to the atmosphere, {{with the result}} that {{alveolar}} air pressure is exactly the same as the ambient air pressure at sea level, at altitude, or in any artificial atmosphere (e.g. a diving chamber, or decompression chamber) in which the individual is breathing freely. With expansion of the lungs (through lowering of the diaphragm and expansion of the thoracic cage) the alveolar air now occupies a larger volume, and its pressure falls proportionally, causing air to flow in from the surroundings, through the airways, till the pressure in the alveoli is once again at the ambient air pressure. The reverse obviously happens during exhalation. This process (of inhalation and exhalation) is exactly the same at sea level, as on top of Mt. Everest, or in a diving chamber or decompression chamber. However, as one rises above sea level the density of the air decreases exponentially (see Fig. 14), halving approximately with every 5500 m rise in altitude. Since the composition of the atmospheric air is almost constant below 80 km, {{as a result of the}} continuous mixing effect of the weather, the concentration of oxygen in the air (mmols O2 per liter of ambient air) decreases at the same rate as the fall in air pressure with altitude.
