5|$|Males mature {{at around}} 15years of age, {{by which time}} they have fully descended {{testicles}} and can reproduce.

5|$|Following {{the early}} {{success of the}} series, three video games based on the series were {{released}} by Acclaim Entertainment.

In 2000, South Park Rally, a racing game, was released on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC.

5|$|In the past, {{the species}} (when {{it was known}} as Calvatia utriformis) has been {{separated}} into three varieties (C.utriformis var. utriformis, C.utriformis var. hungarica and C.utriformis var. gruberi) based on differences in the ornamentation of the exoperidium (outer tissue layer of the wall, or peridium) and spores. However, a 1997 study of these characters revealed that the three varieties are not clearly demarcated. This study and others suggest that variations in the environmental conditions in which the specimens are grown can affect the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> characteristics.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of the remiges (and alulae) of nestling hoatzins is much delayed compared to the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> feathers in other young birds, presumably because young hoatzins are equipped with claws on their first two digits. They use these small rounded hooks to grasp branches when clambering about in trees, and feathering on these digits would presumably interfere with that functionality. Most youngsters shed their claws sometime between their 70th and 100th day of life, but some retain them— though callused-over and unusable— into adulthood.|$|E
5|$|The {{four types}} of flower parts, namely carpels, stamens, petals, and sepals, are {{homologous}} with and derived from leaves, as Goethe correctly noted in 1790. The <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> parts through a pattern of gene expression in the growing zones (meristems) is described by the ABC model of flower development. Each of the {{four types of}} flower parts is serially repeated in concentric whorls, controlled by {{a small number of}} genes acting in various combinations. Thus, A genes working alone result in sepal formation; A and B together produce petals; B and C together create stamens; C alone produces carpels. When none of the genes are active, leaves are formed. Two more groups of genes, D to form ovules and E for the floral whorls, complete the model. The genes are evidently ancient, as old as the flowering plants themselves.|$|E
5|$|The villages {{surrounding}} the royal city {{date back to}} at least the 16th century, when the valleys around Ambohimanga hill were first transformed into rice paddies. Following {{the establishment of a}} royal city on the hilltop, successive rulers put in place regulations to govern the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> villages and manage the subjects inhabiting them. Under Andrianampoinimerina, quotas established a set number of houses for members of influential clans in designated neighborhoods around the hill. This king also established rules to improve sanitation, including standards of cleanliness in domestic courtyards and the quarantine of people suffering from certain illnesses. Ranavalona I specified the physical characteristics of newly constructed houses, including their size and decorative features. In 1862 Radama II gave permission to a group of Christians to negotiate with Tsimahafotsy elders to construct the village's first church, but the Tsimahafotsy initially rejected the request. The king's successor, Queen Rasoherina, later requested the Christians not to gather indoors for services at Ambohimanga in honor of the sanctity of the ancestors. The court was Christianized by Ranavalona II in 1869, and a small chapel was built outside the city's eastern gate, but a permanent church at Ambohimanga was not built until 1883. Following a fire that occurred in 1870 during a visit of Ranavalona II to Ambohimanga, the queen decreed that houses in the village could be constructed in brick, a material previously reserved for tomb and wall construction. A series of ancestral fady (taboos) decreed by Andrianampoinimerina continue to apply in the village, and include prohibitions against corn, pumpkins, pigs, onions, hedgehogs and snails; the use of reeds for cooking; and the cutting or collecting of wood from the sacred forests on the hill.|$|E
