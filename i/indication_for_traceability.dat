40|$|GS 1 {{is seeking}} {{interested}} parties from industry stakeholders and solutions providers in all sectors {{to participate in}} GS 1 Traceability Standard 2 group. Once the entrance criteria is met, this group will follow the GS 1 Global Standards Management Process (GSMP). Overview The years since GS 1 Global Traceability Standard (GTS) was created in 2006 have brought many changes to the landscape <b>for</b> managing <b>traceability.</b> This work will align GS 1 standard <b>for</b> <b>traceability</b> with current market drivers and ensure the standard leverages new technical possibilities. What business challenges are being solved? • Set the direction <b>for</b> achieving <b>traceability</b> across the full/extended supply chain with GS 1 standards • Enable interoperability between traceability systems • Provide the framework to respond to market and regulatory demands <b>for</b> <b>traceability</b> based upon industry best practice • Develop methodologies and guidance Objective of this group: The new standard produced by this group will enable connection of existing and future traceability systems. It will assist all industries using GS 1 standards meet their needs <b>for</b> <b>traceability</b> across the extended 1 supply chain such as: • Conform to regulatory requirements • Manage product and patient safety • Implement a full event based traceability system • Support social and environmental claims • Help organisations improve/maintain/rebuild consumer/patient trust • Increase logistics and operations efficiency The deliverables will be: 1. New major release of GS 1 Global Traceability Standard (GTS) 2. Conformance Standard [technical compliance statements <b>for</b> <b>traceability</b> solutions in the market] Note: Subsequent to deliverable 1 and 2 the group may remain in place to develop Application Standard and/or Guideline...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} the food market has become highly dynamic. Food crises in the early 90 's, or those of the recent years, such as avian flu pandemic, swine flu, the {{cucumber}} or horse meat crises all had {{a negative impact on}} the Romanian food industry. Food deficiencies have led not only to contamination but also to the illness or death of some consumers. 	The products traceability is a prerequisite for success in the food industry.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of improved food traceability systems has aimed to restore consumer confidence in {{food safety and}} quality, in part {{by being able to}} provide consumers with more information about the origins of foods and food ingredients. However, little is known about consumers’ opinions and beliefs associated with traceability, nor their preferences for information provision. In the current paper, consumer information needs and requirements regarding traceability are investigated. Semi-structured interviews with consumers in four European countries focused on the need <b>for</b> <b>traceability,</b> the preferred means of communication, labelling and bodies held responsible <b>for</b> <b>traceability</b> and dealing with fraud. Results show that there is a clear consumer need for varied information about food and the production processes involved.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the sustainable traceability {{issue in the}} food supply chain from the sourcing perspective in which consumer willingness to pay <b>for</b> <b>traceability</b> is considered. There are two supplier types: traceable suppliers, which are costly but can carry a precise recall in food safety events, and non-traceable suppliers, which are less expensive but may suffer a higher cost in food safety events. A portion of consumers display traceability consciousness, {{and are willing to}} pay a premium for traceable food products. Four possible strategies in a transparent food supply chain and three sourcing strategies in a nontransparent food supply chain are identified and we determine when each strategy is optimal. We show that efforts to improve traceability that focus on consumers, by increasing their willingness to pay <b>for</b> <b>traceability</b> or expanding the portion of traceability consciousness consumers, may lead to an unintended consequence, such as a decrease in the provision of traceable food products. However, efforts that focus on revealing and penalizing the buyer always lead to a higher provision of traceable food products. We further find that efforts focusing on eliminating the information asymmetry may not be helpful <b>for</b> sustainable <b>traceability</b> in the food supply chain...|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} {{and organization of}} industries evolves over time in response {{to changes in the}} price and availability of inputs, changes in the demand for outputs and output attributes, and changes in technology. The growing demand <b>for</b> <b>traceability</b> and assurance is a change in the demand for credence attributes. Firms that are able to organize to provide traceability and assurance at low cost will, ceteris paribus, have an advantage. In recent years, many segments of the food and agribusiness industry have become more concentrated through horizontal or vertical integration within firms or within associations of firms (cooperatives). This paper explores changes to the relative competitiveness of vertically integrated firms and horizontally and vertically aligned cooperative associations in response to demand <b>for</b> <b>traceability</b> and assurance with respect to food safety, product quality, and credence attributes.
