40|$|Exposure to {{the aroma}} of ginger root oil (GRO) {{increases}} the mating competitiveness of adult sterile males of the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann). This effect has been observed under various exposure regimes, ranging from small groups of males (25 individuals) held in small cups to large numbers of males (14 million individuals) held in trailers. Here, we assess the efficacy of GRO treatment at an even larger scale at the world’s largest eclosion facility for sterile male medflies located in Retalhuleu, Guatemala. GRO exposure was conducted in several different <b>holding</b> <b>rooms</b> each with a particular dose (0. 37 – 0. 91 ml GRO per m 3 room volume) and each with a unique number of sterile males (59 – 127 million adult males per room). Treated sterile males were exposed to GRO at 3 d of age for 24 h and then held 24 h before testing. Control sterile males were tested at {{the same age as}} treated males but were held in rooms not receiving GRO application. In field tents, we released 50 sterile males (treated or control), 50 wild males, and 50 wild females and collected copulating pairs. Over all trials, control sterile males obtained 19 %– 26 % of the total matings per replicate, whereas treated sterile males obtained significantly higher proportions of the total matings (34 %– 41 %) for all doses tested. Among treated sterile males, relative mating success did not vary significantly with GRO dose. These findings suggest that the use of GRO aromatherapy in the large <b>holding</b> <b>rooms</b> in the Retalhuleu facility will substantially enhance the mating competitiveness of the sterile male medflies...|$|E
40|$|Male {{circumcision}} {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} traditions observed by many societies. The ritual is performed at specific periods in life with the main purpose of integrating the male child into the society according to cultural norms. Recently, especially in the Eastern Cape, many initiates have died or have had to face life with mutilated genitals following this ritual. THE OBJECTIVE: of the study was to explore the causes of morbidity and mortality among traditionally circumcised Xhosa boys in the Eastern Cape. METHODOLOGY: A revelatory case study design was used to obtain information from initiates and traditional surgeons and attendants in the Flagstaff District. RESULTS: From the data collected, restriction of fluid intake, unhealthy surroundings, like, cold and dusty <b>holding</b> <b>rooms</b> and incompetent attendants were cited as factors that contributed to dehydration; wound infection and respiratory infection. CONCLUSION: The initiates recommended a collaboration with the Department of Health to ensure that circumcision is performed by knowledgeable persons in appropriate surroundings i. e. a clean and warm room with adequate space...|$|E
