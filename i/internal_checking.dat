Relationships were investigated between <b>internal</b> <b>checking</b> variables and the other wood properties (basic density, heartwood content, and moisture content) and stem diameter. Neither the size nor the frequency of internal checks showed any marked association {{with any of the}} other disc variables or combination thereof. <b>Internal</b> <b>checking</b> features, however, differed strongly between two regional provenance groups, the Tasmanian provenances having less than half as many as the mainland Australian provenances. Heartwood was markedly less and basic density averaged 9 kg/m 3 higher in the Tasmanian material. The Tasmanian provenances were also superior, albeit marginally, in diameter growth. Accordingly, Tasmanian provenances are recommended over mainland ones for New Zealand plantations, even though tree form is not as good...|$|E

30|$|Large <b>internal</b> <b>checks</b> {{in cross}} {{sections}} might be {{longer in the}} longitudinal direction. Timber containing large <b>internal</b> <b>checks</b> might be undesirable for post or beams, because of the decrease in the shear strength [4]. The shear strength is not required for posts, but with large <b>internal</b> <b>checks</b> {{it is possible to}} decrease the buckling strength. Furthermore, large <b>internal</b> <b>checks</b> may affect joint strength [5]. Recently, not only traditional joints but also the joints using nails or metal fittings are also used. The joint strength would decrease if the nails or bolts are inserted into the large <b>internal</b> <b>checks.</b> This study revealed that the occurrence of <b>internal</b> <b>checks</b> might be affected by the timber quality, even in the same drying schedule. The timber which has large tangential shrinkage, and is susceptible to the formation of larger checks, needs more attention in the choice of the drying method.|$|R
30|$|To {{investigate}} the wood properties affecting the internal-check variation in boxed-heart square timber of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica), two cultivars, yabukuguri and kumotooshi were kiln-dried {{together by the}} high-temperature setting method and their <b>internal</b> <b>checks</b> were compared. There was {{a difference in the}} area of <b>internal</b> <b>checks</b> between the cultivars. Kumotooshi formed a larger area of <b>internal</b> <b>checks,</b> which was thought to be affected by the larger tangential shrinkage of kumotooshi. The number, total length, and total area of <b>internal</b> <b>checks</b> were significantly correlated with tangential shrinkage. The area of <b>internal</b> <b>checks</b> around the pith was also larger for kumotooshi, which might be affected by the larger tangential shrinkage in the core part of kumotooshi. The results supported that tangential shrinkage should be one of the important properties affecting the internal-check variation of sugi boxed-heart square timber.|$|R
30|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the internal checks {{that appeared in the}} boxed-heart square timber taken at two heights along the stems of the sugi cultivars, yabukuguri and kumotooshi. We compared the internal checks in timber that was kiln-dried together, because small differences in the drying schedule can affect <b>internal</b> <b>checking</b> with the high-temperature setting method. Shortening the time of the high-temperature setting treatment can reduce <b>internal</b> <b>checking</b> and create larger stress gradients between the surface and the core [11, 12]. In order to observe <b>internal</b> <b>checking,</b> we used a severer schedule than that used in practice. We investigated the relationships between internal checks and the wood properties such as moisture content, transverse shrinkage, density, and tree ring parameters.|$|E

However, while forecasts using the above wood property models address wood quality and form, other degrading features such as knots, warp on drying and <b>internal</b> <b>checking</b> need consideration. For Lusitanica and Macrocarpa, Low et al. (2005) reported problems with warp on drying for the former taxon and problems with <b>internal</b> <b>checking</b> for the latter. However, the Leyland hybrid was reported as having good performance in terms of both appearance and structural products.

30|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} a method for evaluating test data obtained in kiln-drying lumber. Experimental data on radio-frequency drying of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) beams without pith were used to present a data evaluation method for the length of <b>internal</b> <b>checks</b> of kiln-dried lumber based on a hierarchical model. Occurrence of the <b>internal</b> <b>check</b> phenomenon was determined with the underlying data-generating process, and the length of <b>internal</b> <b>checks</b> was modeled in relation to heating temperature, initial moisture content, final moisture content, and basic density. The diagnosis of the posterior model parameters revealed that heating temperature, initial moisture content, and basic density have a positive influence on the occurrence of <b>internal</b> <b>checks,</b> while final moisture content has a negative influence. A comparison between the developed hierarchical model and conventional statistical analysis used in research on lumber drying showed that a much more detailed analysis of <b>internal</b> <b>check</b> length could be performed by the hierarchical model.|$|R

These {{differences}} in the internal-checking parameters may have occurred because the number and total length of the <b>internal</b> <b>checks</b> (NIC and TLIC) represent the occurrence and propagation of the checks, while the total area of the <b>internal</b> <b>checks</b> (TAIC) represents the amount of shrinkage.|$|R
30|$|After kiln drying, 40 -mm-thick {{transverse}} slices {{were taken}} {{from the center of the}} timber length.

The number (NIC), total area (TAIC), and average area (AAIC) of the <b>internal</b> <b>checks</b> were obtained by the image processing program (ImageJ, NIH). The total length of the <b>internal</b> <b>checks</b> (TLIC) was measured using a ruler. The NIC, TAIC, and TLIC were calculated per square meter of green timber transverse area. Furthermore, to evaluate the radial check from the pith (heart checks), the total area of <b>internal</b> <b>checks</b> within a circle of 20  mm radius from the pith (TAICc) was obtained.|$|R

The extent of the <b>internal</b> <b>checking</b> observed will present a definite problem to many solid wood products.

40|$|One {{potential}} {{failure mode}} for {{a composite of}} concentric cylinders is to form microcracks that span the thickness and length of a single cylinder but are arrested at the boundary to the adjacent cylinder (a crack in the r-z plane). This failure mode was analyzed by developing a new polar shear-lag analysis for stresses in {{a cross section of}} a concentric cylinders structure. The analysis can accurately calculate hoop and shear stress in each cylinder in the vicinity of microcracks. The stresses were used to calculate the energy release rate for formation of a new microcrack as a tool for predicting the microcracking process due to any source of applied or residual stresses. The target problem was to model <b>internal</b> <b>checking</b> in certain species of trees such as radiata pine.

40|$|Heat {{treatment}} {{is a method}} for improving the durability and dimensional stability of wood. The treatment method used in this work is called Thermo Wood and is industrially applied in Finland. In 2004 production was 31146 m 3. The method involves heating wood in a steam atmosphere where the heat causes chemical changes {{in the structure of}} the wood. The present work was done in order to improve the quality of the treated timber both by predicting strength through colour measurement and by understanding the mechanisms behind the <b>internal</b> <b>checking</b> in heat-treated wood.

In paper I the connection between colour and the strength reduction caused by the heat {{treatment is}} studied.
