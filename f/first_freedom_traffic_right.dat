50|$|Fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> are {{sought by}} {{airlines}} wishing {{to take up}} unserved or underserved routes, or by airlines whose flights already make technical stops at a location as allowed by the second freedom. Governments (e.g. Thailand) may sometimes encourage fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> {{as a way of}} promoting tourism, by increasing the number of seats available. In turn, though, there may be reactionary pressure to avoid liberalizing <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> too much in order to protect a flag carrier's commercial interests. By the 1990s, fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> stirred controversy in Asia because of loss-making services by airlines in the countries hosting them. Particularly in protest over US air carriers' service patterns in Asia, some nations have become less generous with regard to granting fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>rights,</b> while sixth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> has grown in importance for Asian airlines.|$|R
5000|$|The fifth freedom allows {{an airline}} to carry revenue traffic between foreign {{countries}} {{as a part}} of services connecting the airline's own country. [...] It is the right to carry passengers from one's own country to a second country, and from that country to a third country (and so on). An example of a fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>right</b> is an Emirates flight in 2004 from Dubai to Brisbane, Australia and onward to Auckland, New Zealand, where tickets can be sold on any sector. Fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> are intended to enhance the economic viability of an airline's long haul routes, but tend to be viewed by local airlines and governments as potentially unfair competition. The negotiations for fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> can be lengthy, because in practice the approval of at least three different nations is required.|$|R

50|$|The Japan-United States {{bilateral}} {{air transport}} agreement of 1952 {{has been viewed}} as being particularly contentious, because unlimited fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> have been granted to designated US air carriers serving destinations in the Asia Pacific region west of Japan. For example, in the early 1990s, the Japanese government's refusal to permit flights on the New York City—Osaka—Sydney route led to protests by the US government and the airlines that applied to serve that route. The Japanese government countered that about 10% of the traffic on the Japan - Australia sector was third and fourth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> {{to and from the}} US, while the bilateral agreement specified that primary justification for unlimited fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> was to fill up aircraft carrying a majority of US-originated or US-destined traffic under third and fourth freedom rights. Japan had held many unused fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> beyond the USA. However, these were seen as being less valuable than the fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> enjoyed by US air carriers via Japan, because of the higher operating costs of Japanese airlines and geographical circumstances. Japan serves as a useful gateway to Asia for North American travelers. The US contended that Japan's favourable geographical location and its flag airlines' carriage of a sizeable volume of sixth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> via gateway cities in Japan helped to level the playing field. In 1995, the air transport agreement was updated by way of liberalizing Japanese carriers' access to US destinations, while placing selected restrictions on US air carriers.|$|R
50|$|Implementation of the Fifth <b>Freedom</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>rights</b> {{have been}} {{targeted}} {{in the air}} routes {{as a result of}} the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding on the Expansion of Air Linkages in BIMP-EAGA during the 3rd BIMP-EAGA Summit recently held in Cebu City on 12 January 2007.

However, it has no rights to transport passengers solely between Cebu and the intermediate stop.|$|R
50|$|On April 2007, 4th BIMP-EAGA Transport, Infrastructure and ICT Development Cluster Meeting, the EAGA {{working group}} on air {{linkages}} agreed to grant fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> (FFTR) to all passenger and cargo services in the airports of Bandar Seri Begawan in Brunei Darussalam; Balikpapan and Pontianak in Indonesia; Kota Kinabalu and Kuching in Malaysia; Davao City and Zamboanga City in the Philippines. Additional FFTR designated points in BIMP-EAGA are Manado and Tarakan in Indonesia; Labuan and Miri in Malaysia; Puerto Princesa and General Santos in the Philippines.|$|R
50|$|Fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> were {{instrumental}} {{to the economic}} viability of long-haul flight until the early 1980s, when advances in technology and increased passenger volume enabled the operation of more non-stop flights. The excess capacity on multi-sector routes could be filled by picking up and dropping off passengers along the way. It was not uncommon for carriers to schedule stops {{in one or more}} foreign countries {{on the way to a}} flight's final destination. Fifth freedom flights were common between Europe and Africa, South America and the Far East. An example of a multi-sector flight in the mid-1980s was an Alitalia service from Rome to Tokyo via Athens, Delhi, Bangkok and Hong Kong. Such routings in Asia approximated the Silk Road. Fifth freedom flights are still highly common in East Asia, particularly on routes serving Tokyo, Hong Kong and Bangkok. Between the latter two destinations, in 2004, service was provided by at least four airlines whose home base was not in either Hong Kong or Bangkok. The Singapore-Bangkok route has also constituted an important fifth freedom market. In the late 1990s, half of the seats available between the two cities were offered by airlines holding fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>rights.</b> Other major markets served by fifth freedom flights can be found in Europe, South America, the Caribbean and the Tasman Sea.|$|R
50|$|The ASEAN-SAM is {{expected}} to fully liberalize air travel between member states in the ASEAN region, allowing ASEAN countries and airlines operating {{in the region to}} directly benefit from the growth in air travel around the world, and also freeing up tourism, trade, investment, and service flows between member states. Since 1 December 2008, restrictions on the third and fourth freedoms of the air between capital cities of member states for air passengers services have been removed, while from 1 January 2009, full liberalization of air freight services in the region took effect. On 1 January 2011, full liberalization on fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> between all capital cities took effect.|$|R
25|$|The ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASEAN-SAM) is the region's {{aviation}} policy geared {{towards the}} development of a unified and single aviation market in Southeast Asia. The aviation policy was proposed by the ASEAN Air Transport Working Group, supported by the ASEAN Senior Transport Officials Meeting, and endorsed by the ASEAN Transport Ministers. The ASEAN-SAM is expected to liberalise air travel between member-states in the ASEAN region, allowing ASEAN airlines to benefit directly from the growth in air travel, and also free up tourism, trade, investment, and service flows between member states. Since 1 December 2008, restrictions on the third and fourth freedoms of the air between capital cities of member states for air passenger services have been removed, while from 1 January 2009, full liberalisation of air freight services in the region took effect. On 1 January 2011, full liberalisation on fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> between all capital cities took effect. The ASEAN Single Aviation Market policy supersedes existing unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral air services agreements among member states which are inconsistent with its provisions.|$|R
50|$|Both the United States and the United Kingdom {{made the}} Bermuda Agreement their model for {{bilateral}} agreements {{with other countries}} until Bermuda II. The only major exception during this era was the 1966 agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, which designated Pan Am and Aeroflot as the operating carriers from each country and left commercial details {{of service to the}} airlines' prior agreement. Although most other agreements during this era followed the Bermuda I model, they tended to include fewer and fewer fifth and sixth <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> (<b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> to and from third countries) as time went on, as the increased range of aircraft made such rights less necessary. The general principles of the Bermuda Agreement were also followed by other countries, such as Canada in its various bilateral agreements.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the nature}} of air {{services}} agreements is essentially a mercantilist negotiation that strives for an equitable exchange of <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> {{the outcome of a}} bilateral agreement may not be fully reciprocal but rather a reflection of the relative size and geographic position of two markets, {{especially in the case of}} a large country negotiating with a much smaller one. In exchange for a smaller state granting fifth freedom rights to a larger country, the smaller country may be able to intermediate sixth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> to onward destinations from the larger country.|$|R
50|$|The {{unofficial}} {{sixth freedom}} combines {{the third and}} fourth freedoms and is the right to carry passengers or cargo from a second country to a third country by stopping in one's own country. It can also be characterized as a form of the fifth freedom with an intermediate stop in the operating airline's home market. This characterization is often invoked as protectionist policy as the <b>traffic,</b> like fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic,</b> is secondary in nature to third and fourth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic.</b> Consequently, some nations seek to regulate sixth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> as though it were fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic.</b> China {{is an example of a}} country that restricts sixth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> from third party countries. Specifically, it is difficult for airlines to obtain permission from China to serve the country via codeshare flights from intermediate countries.|$|R
40|$|International air {{transport}} {{has been one}} of the most highly regulated and restrictive industries in the world, governed by bilateral air services agreements (BASAs). More recently progressive liberalisation, through the gradual removal of regulatory restrictions, has taken place in major air markets of the world. In Africa, more than a decade ago, African leaders agreed to liberalise the intra-African aviation market through the Yamoussoukro Decision (YD) of 2000 but its full potential across the Continent has not yet been realised. Many studies worldwide have been done on air liberalisation and its impact on air traffic flows but very few include Africa. This study focuses on the impact on air passenger traffic flows of South Africa’s aviation policy in Africa by investigating the link between South Africa’s aviation policy, as reflected in the design of its BASAs, and air passenger traffic flows over an 11 year period (2000 to 2010). A mixed research methodology was followed. Qualitatively, a two-round Delphi technique was employed to determine the views of aviation experts from academia, the public and private sectors, on features of BASAs, as well as those unrelated to BASAs, that have an influence on air passenger traffic flows between country-pairs in Africa. Twenty-five BASA features and 48 non-BASA factors were identified from which a conceptual framework was formulated. The quantitative phase aimed at estimating and statistically quantifying the impact of the degree of restrictiveness or liberalisation of the respective BASAs, as measured by four variants of the Air Liberalisation Index (ALI) : STD, 5 th+, DES+ and OWN+. It also aimed at identifying which specific provisions of BASAs had the most significant impact on air passenger traffic flows. A fixed one-way panel regression technique was applied to the selected 11 year panel data set of 42 African countries, representing five markets: intra- African; the SADC; West African; East African and North African. A number of other predictors were also identified which meant that the impact of the aviation policy on air passenger traffic flows could not be tested in isolation: the degree of liberalisation of the policy as measured by the ALI; the number of years BASAs have been in place; GDP; the presence of a low-income country; the magnitude of services trade flows; and population size. The simultaneous impact of the six predictors was tested in each of the five markets with the various markets showing different predictors as being statistically significant. In the intra-African and SADC regional markets these were Trade, ALI and GDP; in the East African market Low Income, Trade, ALI and Population but in the North African market only GDP. Where the impact of the aviation policy was found to be significant, individual provisions such as fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>rights,</b> capacity, designation and cooperative arrangements were tested for their impact on air passenger traffic over two time periods: 2000 – 2010 and 2006 – 2010. These also proved to be significantly different for the various regions. The results of this research provide new insights into the relationship between air passenger traffic flows and aviation policy in the South African – intra-African and regional contexts. The research technique used in the South African – intra-African market expands on the established cross-sectional 2005 QUASAR database, laying a foundation for similar studies in other regions where impact of policy over time can be established.

One major part of the thesis generally analyses different means of distributing limited public right, in order to determine an appropriate method for the allocation of air <b>traffic</b> <b>rights.</b> After a comparison with the telecommunication sector, it is concluded that the most appropriate approach is to conduct a Beauty Contest in the form of a Documentary Hearing.

Subsequently, a glance is taken at the methods for allocating air <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> that are currently applied in several countries. It can be seen that all these countries have chosen the same approach, a Beauty Contest, and that they all are facing the same difficulties, which are inconsistency and ambiguity of the distribution procedure. Furthermore, a short evaluation, whether the General Agreement on Trade in Services has an impact on the allocation of air <b>traffic</b> <b>rights,</b> is undertaken. However, this is denied.
