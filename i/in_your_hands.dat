500|$|Some reviewers {{noticed the}} {{combination}} of musical genres. Christina Kelly from Rolling Stone magazine criticised the group's image, and added that their songs, including [...] "Wannabe," [...] were [...] "a watered-down mix of hip-hop and cheesy pop balladry, brought together by a manager with a marketing concept." [...] Matt Diehl of Entertainment Weekly {{said that it was}} [...] "more a compendium of music styles (from ABBA-style choruses to unconvincing hip hop) than an actual song," [...] and Sara Scribner of the Los Angeles Times described it as [...] "a bubblegum hip-hop confection of rapping lifted off Neneh Cherry and Monie Love albums." [...] Charles Aaron of Spin magazine called it [...] "a quickie, mid-'80s teen paperback come to life [...] so gooey it melts <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands,</b> not in your mouth." [...] The song ranked at fifteenth on Village Voice's 1997 [...] "Pazz & Jop" [...] critics' poll, conducted by music journalist Robert Christgau.|$|E

500|$|Digital rights advocates, {{including}} the Free Software Foundation, Electronic Frontier Foundation, and computer engineer and activist Brewster Kahle, {{have criticized the}} iPad for its digital rights restrictions. In April 2010, Paul Sweeting, an analyst with GigaOM, was quoted by National Public Radio as saying, [...] "With the iPad, you have the anti-Internet <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands.</b> ... It offers [...] the opportunity to essentially re-create the old business model, wherein they are pushing content to you on their terms rather than you going out and finding content, or a search engine discovering content for you." [...] But Sweeting also thought that the limitations imposed by Apple impart {{the feeling of a}} safe neighborhood, saying, [...] "Apple is offering you a gated community where there's a guard at the gate, and there's probably maid service, too." [...] Laura Sydell, the article's author, concludes, [...] "As more consumers have fears about security on the Internet, viruses and malware, they may be happy to opt for Apple's gated community." [...] The Russian government has switched from iPads to Android devices over security concerns.|$|E

In 2014, Weinberg was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame {{as a member of the}} E Street Band.

In late October 2014, Weinberg sat in for a surprise guest appearance on Conan. In early 2015, Weinberg received the Humanitarian of the Year Award from Temple Rodeph Torah in Marlboro, New Jersey, in recognition of his volunteering in association with multiple local groups; he said he was humbled to be accepting an award that focused on tikkun olam.|$|E
500|$|In Cosmas's writing, {{the saint}} was named [...] "Jovan from Vladimir"; {{his father was}} Nemanja (historically, Grand Prince of Raška from 1166 to 1196), and his {{grandfather}} was Simeon (Bulgarian Tsar from 893 to 927). He married a daughter of Samuel, the tsar of Bulgaria and Ohrid. He succeeded his father as emperor of Albania, Illyria, and Dalmatia. After Byzantine Emperor Basil defeated Tsar Samuel, Emperor Jovan defeated Basil. He also fought against the Bogomil and Messalian heretics. From his early youth, Jovan Vladimir longed for the Kingdom of God. After he was married, he prayed day and night, and abstained from intercourse with his wife. She was a heretic like her brother, whom she incited to kill Jovan. When the two brothers-in-law rode together, accompanied by soldiers, the heretic suddenly struck Jovan with a sword at a mountain pass named Derven, but could not cut him. Only when Jovan gave him his own sword was the murderer able to cut off his head. Jovan caught {{it in the air}} and rode on to the church he had built near Elbasan. There he put his head down, saying, [...] "Lord Jesus Christ, <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> I place my spirit," [...] and died; it was AD899. He was buried in the church, which then became the scene of many miracles. The saint's beneficent power is described in the hagiography: ...|$|E

You couldn't do that on a Game Boy!" [...] By contrast, IGN reviewer Levi Buchanan noted the Game Gear's biggest fault was its game library when compared to the Game Boy, stating that [...] "the software was completely lacking compared to its chief rival, which was bathed in quality games. It didn't matter that the Game Gear was more powerful. The color screen did not reverse any fortunes. Content and innovation beat out technology, a formula that Nintendo is using right now with the continued ascendance of the DS and Wii." [...] Buchanan later went on to praise some parts of the Game Gear's library, however, stating [...] "Some of those Master System tweaks were very good games, and fun is resilient against time." [...] Retro Gamer praised Sega's accomplishment in surviving against the competition of Nintendo in the handheld console market with the Game Gear, noting that [...] "for all the handhelds that have gone up against the might of Nintendo and ultimately lost out, Sega's Game Gear managed to last the longest, only outdone in sales by the Sony PSP. [...] For its fans, it will remain a piece of classic gaming hardware whose legacy lives on forever." ...|$|E
