Following the attack on Pearl <b>Harbor,</b> <b>American</b> forces identified French Polynesia as an ideal refuelling point between Hawaii and Australia and, with de Gaulle's agreement, organized [...] "Operation Bobcat" [...] sending nine ships with 5000 American soldiers to build a naval refuelling base and airstrip and set up coastal defense guns on Bora Bora.

Though the administration (including President Roosevelt and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover) dismissed rumors of Japanese American espionage on behalf of the Japanese war effort, pressure mounted upon the administration as the tide of public opinion turned against Japanese Americans.|$|E

But Francis Alexander reached the writer well ahead of his peers—by traveling in a small advance boat to greet Dickens as his vessel entered the <b>harbor.</b> <b>American</b> poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (whom Alexander also painted) would later coin the verb Alexandered (as in, wangled), sniffing that such and such a person had Alexandered his way into a highly coveted invitation to a party. He died in 1881 in Florence.|$|E

As at Pearl <b>Harbor,</b> <b>American</b> aircraft were severely damaged in the initial Japanese attack. Lacking air cover, the American Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines withdrew to Java on 12 December 1941. General Douglas MacArthur was ordered out, leaving his men at Corregidor {{on the night of}} 11 March 1942 for Australia, 4,000 km away. The 76,000 starving and sick American and Filipino defenders on Bataan surrendered on 9 April 1942, and were forced to endure the infamous Bataan Death March on which 7,000-10,000 died or were murdered.

5000|$|Once World War II had {{erupted in}} 1939, Canada {{had a small}} navy. In 1939 Canada had seven warships. Once {{entering}} the war, Canada needed a naval reformation {{in order to keep}} up with and aid the British. On the outbreak of the war Canada had roughly 3,500 men supporting the RCN. In September 1940 [...] "the RCN grew to 10,000 men". The Canadian government agencies also {{played a major role in}} the patterns of warfare in the Atlantic. The Canadian Navies Division operated a network of naval control of shipping agents in the neutral United States from 1939 to 1941. These agents managed the shipping movements of British shipping in the United States, and also managed the growing United States Navy systems in regards to basic trade movements. Special publications on trade matters were supplied to the United States Navy from Ottawa in 1941, and by the time of Pearl <b>Harbor</b> <b>American</b> port directors were working with Ottawa as a team. Ottawa’s job of studying trade movements and keeping track of intelligence was so effective and crucial that they were given the task of controlling shipping west of 40〫and north of the equator from December 1941 to July 1942, along with supplying the USN trade directorate with daily intelligence.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to {{the attack}} on Pearl <b>Harbor,</b> <b>American</b> {{planners}} foresaw {{the possibility of a}} two-front war. Chief of Naval Operations Harold Rainsford Stark authored the Plan Dog memo, which advocated concentrating on victory in Europe while staying on the defensive in the Pacific. However, the U.S. reassurance to the UK notwithstanding, the U.S.'s immediate concern was with Japan. As Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall later said, [...] "we had a fair understanding of what we had best do rather than the necessity of engaging in prolonged conversations[...] [...] [...] This understanding, which included a recognition that Germany was the main enemy and that the major effort would be made initially in Europe, was obviously not applicable in the present situation. Of first importance now was the necessity to check the Japanese." [...] Nonetheless, Marshall and other U.S. generals advocated the invasion of northern Europe in 1943, which the British rejected. After Churchill pressed for a landing in French North Africa in 1942, Marshall suggested instead to Roosevelt that the U.S. abandon the Germany-first strategy and take the offensive in the Pacific. Roosevelt [...] "disapproved" [...] the proposal saying it would do nothing to help Russia. With Roosevelt's support, and Marshall unable to persuade the British to change their minds, in July 1942 Operation Torch was scheduled for later that year.|$|E

A reduction in total numbers of corals, a change in the relative proportions of different genera, and a probable reduction in the average size of individual colonies are recorded. Elsewhere in the harbor, more drastic effects on the reefs were noted. Both human and natural impacts may be responsible for the observed changes; it is suggested that the Aua reef may now be recovering from earlier damaging events...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Social Sciences: Environment and Community Program, 2014 Food {{advertisements}} represent {{complex and}} constant conversations about race, class, gender, and modernity within an American context. Inherently visual, food advertisements {{suffer from a}} lack of research that analyzes them in their entirety. By taking a postmodern feminist approach that considers the imagery of food advertisements as a text, this thesis will attempt to unravel the complex messages that food advertisements relay about a person's identity, particularly, what these messages say about gender and gender roles. Present-day food advertisements are shown in comparison with food advertisements from the 1950 s and 1960 s, seeking to discover whether the messages regarding gender and identity have changed, or if the only the image has changed. Additionally, this thesis examines gender attitudes and beliefs connected to the messages in food advertisements. Food advertisements??? visual components are analyzed as texts, searching for signs, signifiers, and postmodern imagery, while also acknowledging the inherently gendered canvas, on which the advertisements are printed. A content analysis of three women???s magazines, Good Housekeeping (founded in 1885), Ladies Home Journal (founded in 1883), and Better Homes and Gardens (founded in 1922), from three different time periods, 1950 - 52, 1960 - 62, and 2009 - 2013, was used to survey a breadth of food advertisements, while also providing a method to individually examine many of the advertisements. Only magazines geared toward women were utilized with the goal of analyzing the messages food advertisements send to a mostly female audience. This thesis suggests that these advertisements not only <b>harbor</b> <b>American</b> gendered societal requirements and desires but also carry a heavy, influential, gendered anchor...|$|E

Pan American World Airways established a seaplane base on the island for its trans-Pacific San Francisco-Manila-Hong Kong route, and the Commercial Pacific Cable Company had earlier built a telegraph/telephone station in 1903 for its trans-oceanic communication line.

In addition, Japan made major military moves into Southeast Asia and the East Indies islands of the South Pacific Ocean against the British and Dutch colonies, opening a new wider Pacific phase in the Second World War.|$|R

One scholar says that the censor suggested [...] "we believe that even Japanese do something like kissing when they love each other. Why don't you include that in your films?" [...] Americans encouraged such scenes to force the Japanese to express publicly actions, feelings that had been considered strictly private. Since Pearl <b>Harbor,</b> <b>Americans</b> had felt that the Japanese were [...] "sneaky", claiming that [...] "if Japanese kissed in private, they should do it in public too." ...|$|R
