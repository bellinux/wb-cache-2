5|$|Also, {{differences}} in morphology and development are seen. In the <b>desert</b> <b>locust</b> and the migratory locust, for example, the gregaria nymphs become darker with strongly contrasting yellow and black markings, they grow larger, and have longer developmental periods. The adults are larger with different body proportions, less sexual dimorphism, and higher metabolic rates. They mature more rapidly and start reproducing earlier, but have {{lower levels of}} fecundity.|$|E
5|$|These {{changes are}} {{examples}} of phase polymorphism; they were first analysed and described by Boris Uvarov, who was instrumental in setting up the Anti-Locust Research Centre. He made his discoveries during his studies of the <b>desert</b> <b>locust,</b> whose solitary and gregarious phases had previously been thought to be separate species. He designated the two phases as solitaria and gregaria. These are {{also referred to as}} statary and migratory morphs, though strictly speaking, their swarms are nomadic rather than migratory. Charles Valentine Riley and Norman Criddle were also involved in achieving the understanding and control of locusts.|$|E
5|$|Locusts yield {{about five}} times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of {{greenhouse}} gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100 g of <b>desert</b> <b>locust</b> provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286mg of cholesterol. Among the fatty acids, palmitoleic, oleic and linolenic acids {{were found to be}} the most abundant. Varying amounts of potassium, sodium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc were present.|$|E

30|$|Cyclical {{microhabitat}} shifting {{may also}} aid thermoregulation. <b>Desert</b> <b>locusts</b> thermoregulate by basking in sunlight, when cold (Waloff 1963). Roosting high in trees may facilitate such radiative heating (Whitman 1987, 1988). Tree tops {{are the first}} microhabitat to receive sunlight at dawn. In contrast, a locust on the ground would not only receive direct sunlight later, but would heat more slowly because of thermal inertia of the cool dawn soil. However, as the sun rises, the desert ground heats rapidly, and by midday often becomes lethally hot. According to various authors, <b>Desert</b> <b>locusts</b> enter heat torpor at about 49  °C (see Table  6.1 in Chappell and Whitman 1990). As such, on warm days, <b>Desert</b> <b>locusts</b> must leave the ground microhabitat well before midday, as observed for some other desert grasshoppers, such as Taeniopoda eques (Whitman, 1987).|$|R

5|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>locust</b> (Schistocerca gregaria) is {{probably}} the best-known species owing to its wide distribution (North Africa, Middle East, and Indian subcontinent) {{and its ability to}} migrate over long distances. A major infestation covered much of western Africa in 2003-4, after unusually heavy rain set up favourable ecological conditions for swarming. The first outbreaks occurred in Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and Sudan in the autumn of 2003. The rain allowed swarms to develop and move north to Morocco and Algeria, threatening croplands. Swarms crossed Africa, appearing in Egypt, Jordan and Israel, the first time in those countries for 50 years. The cost of handling the infestation was put at US$122 million, and the damage to crops at up to $2.5 billion.|$|E
25|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>locust</b> is {{potentially}} {{the most dangerous}} of the locust pests because of the ability of swarms to fly rapidly across great distances. It has two to five generations per year. The last major <b>desert</b> <b>locust</b> upsurge in 2004–05 caused significant crop losses in West Africa and had {{a negative impact on}} food security in the region.

25|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>locust</b> (Schistocerca gregaria) is {{a species}} of locust. Plagues of desert locusts have {{threatened}} agricultural production in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia for centuries. The livelihood of at least one-tenth of the world’s human population can be affected by this voracious insect.|$|E
25|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>locust</b> has {{natural enemies}} such as predatory wasps and flies, {{parasitoid}} wasps, predatory beetle larvae, birds and reptiles. These may be effective at keeping solitary populations in check but are of limited effects against gregarious desert locusts {{because of the}} enormous numbers of insects in the swarms and hopper bands.|$|E
25|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>locust</b> is a {{difficult}} pest to control, and control measures are further compounded by the large and often remote areas (16-30 million km²) where locusts can be found. Undeveloped basic infrastructure in some affected countries, limited resources for locust monitoring and control, and political turmoil within and between affected countries further reduce the capacity of a country to undertake the necessary monitoring and control activities.|$|E
50|$|In the field, {{according}} to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the average density of marching bands is 50 locusts/m2 (50 million locusts/km2), with a typical range from 20 to 120 locusts/m2. The research findings discussed above demonstrate the dynamic instability that is present at the lower locust densities typical in the field, where marching groups randomly switch direction without any external perturbation. Understanding this phenomenon, together with the switch to fully coordinated marching at higher densities, is essential if the swarming of <b>desert</b> <b>locusts</b> is to be controlled.|$|R
50|$|One {{of the key}} {{predictions}} of the SPP model is that as the population density of a group increases, an abrupt transition occurs from individuals moving in relatively disordered and independent ways within the group to the group moving as a highly aligned whole. Thus, {{in the case of}} young <b>desert</b> <b>locusts,</b> a trigger point should occur which turns disorganised and dispersed locusts into a coordinated marching army. When the critical population density is reached, the insects should start marching together in a stable way and in the same direction.|$|R
