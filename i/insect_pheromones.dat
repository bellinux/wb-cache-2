Biochemical pesticides are similar to naturally occurring chemicals and are nontoxic, such as <b>insect</b> <b>pheromones</b> used to locate mates, while microbial biopesticides like Green Muscle come from bacteria, fungi, algae or viruses that either occur naturally or are genetically altered. Entomopathogenic fungi generally suppress pests by mycosis: causing a disease that is specific to the insect.|$|E
500|$|At a {{local high}} school, Winky {{and his brother}} film a {{memorial}} service for Dare, much to the annoyance of his girlfriend Natalie. The teens harass Dylan Lokensgard, the son of the principal and a social outcast. Doggett and Reyes arrive at the school to talk to Winky. During their interview, body lice mysteriously attack him and bite [...] "Dumbass" [...] into his flesh. While watching the Dumbass recordings, Doggett notices that Dylan was at each of the stunts and decides to question him. While the two agents talk to Dylan, his mother appears and tries to stop the questioning. During the proceedings, Dylan becomes covered in flies; subsequently, Reyes starts to believe that Dylan is behind the attack. The agents take a tissue soaked with Dylan's sweat back for Scully to analyze. The results show that Dylan's body fluids contain a high number of <b>insect</b> <b>pheromones.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{species has}} been {{classified}} as a noxious insect in the United States and Canada, leading to restrictions on produce from counties with substantial populations. Typical orchard control of the insect commonly involves Integrated Pest Management (IPM) regimes {{using a variety of}} methods such as insecticide applications and application of horticultural oils to smother insects and egg masses, biological control including Bacillus thuringiensis (BT) and occasionally mating disruption, which typically involves releasing synthetic <b>insect</b> <b>pheromones</b> to confuse the male moth's tracking of female scent. [...] This results in fewer fertile pairings and thus fewer offspring. Sex pheromone lures are also often used to assess and monitor populations of moths in specific areas.|$|E

2500|$|Entomophily or insect {{pollination}} {{is a form}} of pollination whereby pollen of plants, especially but not only of [...] flowering plants, is distributed by insects. Flowers pollinated by insects typically advertise themselves with bright colours, sometimes with conspicuous patterns (honey guides) leading to rewards of pollen and nectar; they may also have an attractive scent which in some cases mimics <b>insect</b> <b>pheromones.</b> Insect pollinators such as bees have adaptations for their role, such as lapping or sucking mouthparts to take in nectar, and in some species also pollen baskets on their hind legs. This required the coevolution of insects and flowering plants in the development of pollination behaviour by the insects and pollination mechanisms by the flowers, benefiting both groups.|$|E

40|$|Many moth pheromones are {{composed}} of mixtures of acetates of long-chain (≥ 10 carbon) fatty alcohols. Moth pheromone precursors such as fatty acids and fatty alcohols can be produced in yeast by the heterologous expression of genes involved in <b>insect</b> <b>pheromone</b> production. Acetyltransferases that subsequently catalyze the formation of acetates by transfer of the acetate unit from acetyl-CoA to a fatty alcohol have been postulated in pheromone biosynthesis. However, so far no fatty alcohol acetyltransferases responsible {{for the production of}} straight chain alkyl acetate <b>pheromone</b> components in <b>insects</b> have been identified. In search for a non-insect acetyltransferase alternative, we expressed a plant-derived diacylglycerol acetyltransferase (EaDAcT) (EC 2. 3. 1. 20) cloned from the seed of the burning bush (Euonymus alatus) in a yeast system. EaDAcT transformed various fatty alcohol <b>insect</b> <b>pheromone</b> precursors into acetates but we also found high background acetylation activities. Only one enzyme in yeast was shown to be responsible for the majority of that background activity, the acetyltransferase ATF 1 (EC 2. 3. 1. 84). We further investigated the usefulness of ATF 1 for the conversion of moth pheromone alcohols into acetates in comparison with Ea DAcT. Overexpression of ATF 1 revealed that it was capable of acetylating these fatty alcohols with chain lengths from 10 to 18 carbons with up to 27 - and 10 -fold higher in vivo and in vitro efficiency, respectively, compared to Ea DAcT. The ATF 1 enzyme thus has the potential to serve as the missing enzyme in the reconstruction of the biosynthetic pathway of <b>insect</b> acetate <b>pheromones</b> from precursor fatty acids in yeast...|$|R

40|$|A new {{intercalation}} compound of <b>insect</b> <b>pheromone,</b> valeric acid (VA), based on zinc layered hydroxide (ZLH) as host release material, was successfully prepared through coprecipitation method. The as-produced organic-inorganic nanolayered material, valerate nanohybrid, VAN, shows {{the formation of}} a new peak at lower 2 θ angle with basal spacing of 19. 8 [*]Å with no ZnO reflections, which indicate that the intercalation of anion between the inorganic ZLH interlamellae was accomplished. The elemental, FTIR, and ATR analyses of the nanohybrid supported the fact that the intercalation with the percentage anion loading was calculated to be 23. 0 % (w/w). The thermal stability property of the resulting nanohybrid was enhanced compared to the unbound anion. Field emission scanning electron micrograph of the ZnO has a nonuniform granular structure but transforms into flake-like structure with various sizes after the intercalation process. Release kinetics of anion from the interlayer of intercalated compound exhibited a slow release behavior governed by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model at different pHs of aqueous media. The valerate anion was released from VAN with the highest release rate at pH 4. These findings provide the basis to further development of controlled release formulation for <b>insect</b> <b>pheromone</b> based on ZLH intercalation...|$|R

50|$|The {{technique}} is widely applied in screening of <b>insect</b> <b>pheromones</b> {{by examining the}} responses to fractions of a compound mixture separated using chromatography.

50|$|Callow became {{interested}} in the structure and action of “queen substance,” produced by the queen honeybee, after hearing a talk by Dr. Colin G. Butler on honeybee behaviour at NIMR. Queen substance controls queen-rearing by honeybees, as well as being the sex pheromone attracting drones to a queen on her nuptial flights. Callow isolated and identified this as 9-oxodec-trans-2-enoic acid in 1959. This work led to a general interest in the biochemistry of insects. After he retired from the NIMR in 1966, Callow joined the staff at Rothamsted Experimental Station in the insecticide department. Using a mass spectrometer, he carried out work in the field of <b>insect</b> <b>pheromones</b> until 1971.|$|E
