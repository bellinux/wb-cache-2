While {{he tried to}} keep the condition a secret, the National Enquirer disclosed that he had [...] "terminal cancer" [...] on March 11, 1980. In July, McQueen traveled to Rosarito Beach, Mexico, for unconventional treatment after US doctors told him they could do nothing to prolong his life. Controversy arose over the trip, because McQueen sought treatment from William Donald Kelley, who was promoting a variation of the <b>Gerson</b> <b>therapy</b> that used coffee enemas, frequent washing with shampoos, daily injections of fluid containing live cells from cattle and sheep, massage, and laetrile, an anticancer drug available in Mexico, but described as canonical quackery by mainstream scientists. McQueen paid for Kelley's treatments by himself in cash payments which were said to have been upwards of $40,000 per month ($ today) during his three-month stay in Mexico. Kelley's only medical license (until revoked in 1976) had been for orthodontics.

5000|$|Max Gerson (1881-1959), was a German-born American {{physician}} who developed a dietary-based alternative cancer treatment that he claimed could cure cancer and most chronic, degenerative diseases. His treatment was called The <b>Gerson</b> <b>Therapy.</b> Most notably, <b>Gerson</b> <b>Therapy</b> was used, unsuccessfully, to treat Jessica Ainscough. According to Quackwatch, Gerson Institute claims of cure are {{based not on}} actual documentation of survival, but on [...] "a combination of the doctor's estimate that the departing patient has a 'reasonable chance of surviving', plus feelings that the Institute staff have {{about the status of}} people who call in". The American Cancer Society reports that [...] "there is no reliable scientific evidence that <b>Gerson</b> <b>therapy</b> is effective..." ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{contains}} observations and historical consider-ations on cancer and complementary and alternative medi-cine (CAM) in the Tijuana, Mexico, area. There are approximately 2 dozen such clinics in Tijuana, {{some of which}} have been treating international cancer patients since 1963. Among the first clinics to be established were the Bio-Medical Center (Hoxsey therapy), Oasis of Hope (a Laetrile-oriented clinic), and a series of clinics affiliated with the <b>Gerson</b> diet <b>therapy.</b> These original clinics were es-tablished mainly by American citizens in response to in-creased regulation of nonstandard therapies in the United States, particularly after passage of the Kefauver-Harris Amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act in 1962. In the 1970 s, the Tijuana clinics proliferated with the up-surge of interest in Laetrile (amygdalin). By 1978, 70, 000 US cancer patients had taken Laetrile for cancer treatment, and many of those had gone to Tijuana to receive it. The popular-ity of the Tijuana clinics peaked in the mid- 1980 s. Although many new clinics opened after then, a dozen have folded in the past 10 years alone. The turning point for the clinics came with passage of the North American Free Trade Agree-ment (NAFTA), which facilitated greater cooperation among the antifraud authorities of Canada, the United States, and Mexico. In 1994, the tripartite members of NAFTA forme...|$|R

5000|$|The American Cancer Society {{reported}} that [...] "there is no reliable {{scientific evidence that}} <b>Gerson</b> <b>therapy</b> is effective in treating cancer, and the principles behind it are not widely accepted by the medical community. It is not approved {{for use in the}} United States." [...] In 1947, the National Cancer Institute reviewed 10 claimed cures submitted by Gerson; however, all of the patients were receiving standard anticancer treatment simultaneously, making it impossible to determine what effect, if any, was due to Gerson's therapy. A review of the <b>Gerson</b> <b>Therapy</b> by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center concluded: [...] "If proponents of such therapies wish them to be evaluated scientifically and considered valid adjuvant treatments, they must provide extensive records (more than simple survival rates) and conduct controlled, prospective studies as evidence". In 1959, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) again reviewed cases of patients treated by Gerson. The NCI found that the available information did not prove the regimen had benefit. Cancer Research UK states that [...] "Available scientific evidence does not support any claims that <b>Gerson</b> <b>therapy</b> can treat cancer ... <b>Gerson</b> <b>therapy</b> can be very harmful to your health." ...|$|E

50|$|Max Gerson (October 18, 1881 - March 8, 1959) was a Jewish, German-born American {{physician}} {{who developed the}} <b>Gerson</b> <b>Therapy,</b> a dietary-based alternative cancer treatment that he claimed could cure cancer and most chronic, degenerative diseases.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gerson</b> <b>therapy</b> {{can lead}} to several {{significant}} health problems. Serious illness and death have occurred {{as a direct result}} of some portions of the treatment, including severe electrolyte imbalances. Continued use of enemas may weaken the colon's normal function, causing or worsening constipation and colitis. Other complications have included dehydration, serious infections and severe bleeding.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} diets and diet-based regimes are {{claimed to be}} useful against cancer. Popular types of [...] "anti-cancer" [...] diet include the Breuss diet, <b>Gerson</b> <b>therapy,</b> the Budwig {{protocol}} and the macrobiotic diet. None of these diets {{has been found to}} be effective, and some of them have been found to be harmful.|$|E
5000|$|Ainscough's {{advocacy}} of <b>Gerson</b> <b>therapy,</b> in particular, was highlighted by Professor John Dwyer of Friends of Science in Medicine: [...] "There is no credible scientific evidence {{for any of}} these alternative treatments that claim to cure cancer," [...] adding that [...] "it can be difficult for people to tell what claims are unscientific and what are not".|$|E
50|$|<b>Gerson</b> <b>Therapy</b> {{is based}} on the belief that disease is caused by the {{accumulation}} of unspecified toxins, and attempts to treat the disease by having patients consume a predominantly vegetarian diet including hourly glasses of organic juice and various dietary supplements. Animal proteins are excluded from the diet under the unproven premise that tumors develop as a result of pancreatic enzyme deficiency. In addition, patients receive enemas of coffee, castor oil and sometimes hydrogen peroxide or ozone.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013 the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center {{characterized}} Kelley's therapy {{as a type}} of metabolic therapy, like <b>Gerson</b> <b>therapy</b> and Contreras therapy, {{that shows}} [...] "no evidence of efficacy". According to the Center, [...] "findings from a study involving patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer showed a decrease in overall survival and poorer quality of life ... compared to standard gemcitabine-based chemotherapy". The coffee enemas that form part of the treatment can have harmful, and possibly fatal, side effects.|$|E
50|$|Leslie Kenton's book Raw Energy - Eat Your Way to Radiant Health, {{published}} in 1984, added popularity to {{foods such as}} sprouts, seeds, and fresh vegetable juices. The book advocates a diet of 75% raw food which it claims will prevent degenerative diseases, slow the effects of aging, provide enhanced energy, and boost emotional balance; it cites examples such as the sprouted-seed-enriched diets of the long-lived Hunza people and <b>Gerson</b> <b>therapy,</b> an unhealthy, dangerous and potentially very harmful raw juice-based diet and detoxification regime claimed to treat cancer.|$|E
5000|$|Attempts to {{independently}} {{check the}} results of the therapy have been negative. A group of 13 patients sickened by elements of the <b>Gerson</b> <b>Therapy</b> were evaluated in hospitals in San Diego in the early 1980s; all 13 were found to still have active cancer. An investigation by Quackwatch found that the institute's claims of cure were based not on actual documentation of survival, but on [...] "a combination of the doctor's estimate that the departing patient has a 'reasonable chance of surviving', plus feelings that the Institute staff have about the status of people who call in".|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{approaches}} in alternative medicine claim to remove [...] "toxins" [...] {{from the body}} through herbal, electrical or electromagnetic treatments. These toxins are undefined and have no scientific basis, making the validity of such techniques questionable. There is little evidence for toxic accumulation in these cases, as the liver and kidneys automatically detoxify and excrete many toxic materials including metabolic wastes. Under this theory if toxins are too rapidly released without being safely eliminated (such as when metabolizing fat that stores toxins) they can damage the body and cause malaise. Therapies include contrast showers, detoxification foot pads, oil pulling, <b>Gerson</b> <b>therapy,</b> snake-stones, body cleansing, Scientology's Purification Rundown, water fasting, and metabolic therapy.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Gerson escaped Nazi Germany and {{emigrated to}} the United States in 1936, passed his medical board examination, and became a U.S. citizen in 1942.The rest of his family died at {{the hand of the}} Nazis. In the U.S., Gerson applied his dietary therapy to several cancer patients, {{claiming}} good results, but other workers found his methodology and claims unconvincing. Proponents of the <b>Gerson</b> <b>Therapy</b> believe a conspiracy headed by the medical establishment prevented Gerson from publishing proof that his therapy worked. In 1958, Gerson published a book in which he claimed to have cured 50 terminal cancer patients: A Cancer Therapy: Results of 50 Cases. In 1953, Gerson's malpractice insurance was discontinued and, in 1958, his medical license in New York was suspended for two years. Gerson died March 8, 1959 of pneumonia.|$|E
5000|$|After Gerson's death, his {{daughter}} Charlotte Gerson continued {{to promote the}} therapy, founding the [...] "Gerson Institute" [...] in 1977. The original protocol also included raw calf's liver taken orally, but this practice was discontinued in the 1980s after ten patients were hospitalized (five of them comatose) from January 1979 to March 1981 in San Diego, California, area hospitals due to infection with the rare bacteria Campylobacter fetus. This infection was seen only in those following Gerson-type therapy with raw liver (no other cases of patients having sepsis with this microbe, a pathogen in cattle, had been reported to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the previous two years). Nine of ten hospitalized patients had been treated in Tijuana, Mexico; the tenth followed <b>Gerson</b> <b>therapy</b> at home. One of these patients who had metastatic melanoma died {{within a week of}} his septic episode. Many of the patients had low sodium levels, thought {{to be associated with the}} very low sodium Gerson diet.|$|E
50|$|Gibson's and The Whole Pantry's {{statements}} {{regarding the}} benefits of exercise, healthy eating and a positive mindset were uncontroversial, being widely acknowledged as conducive to holistic well being. However, on her now deleted 'OnlyBelle' Instagram account and in other social media, Gibson also promoted more controversial or potentially dangerous alternative medical practices, including; <b>Gerson</b> <b>therapy,</b> anti-vaccination, and the consumption of non-pasteurised raw milk. The highly controversial Gerson treatment had been similarly promoted by another Australian 'wellness' blogger, Jessica Ainscough, whose funeral Gibson attended when Ainscough succumbed to her cancer at age 29 in late February 2015. With approximately 97% of the population under seven years of age immunised, Australian Government vaccination policy heavily penalises parents who refuse to vaccinate their children, by denying access to significant welfare and other benefits, worth approximately $11,700 per annum. The consumption of raw milk is illegal in Australia and, in 2014 in Gibson's state of Victoria, one three-year-old died and another four {{children under the age}} of five became seriously ill after consuming non-pasteurised raw milk.|$|E
