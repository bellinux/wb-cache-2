5|$|Cells {{are known}} to {{eliminate}} three types of damage to their DNA by chemically reversing it. These mechanisms do not require a template, since the types of damage they counteract can occur in {{only one of the}} four bases. Such direct reversal mechanisms are specific to the type of damage incurred and do not involve breakage of the phosphodiester backbone. The formation of pyrimidine dimers upon irradiation with UV light results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent pyrimidine bases. The photoreactivation process directly reverses this damage by the action of the enzyme photolyase, whose activation is obligately dependent on energy absorbed from blue/UV light (300–500nm wavelength) to promote catalysis. Photolyase, an old enzyme present in bacteria, fungi, and most animals no longer functions in humans, who instead use nucleotide excision repair to repair damage from UV irradiation. Another type of damage, methylation of guanine bases, is directly reversed by the protein methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT), the bacterial equivalent of which is called ogt. This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> process because each MGMT molecule can be used only once; that is, the reaction is stoichiometric rather than catalytic. A generalized response to methylating agents in bacteria is known as the adaptive response and confers a level of resistance to alkylating agents upon sustained exposure by upregulation of alkylation repair enzymes. The third type of DNA damage reversed by cells is certain methylation of the bases cytosine and adenine.|$|E
25|$|Economically, {{pressure}} <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> commodity. Pipes, valves, {{and reaction}} vessels {{need to be}} strengthened, and there are safety considerations of working at 20MPa. In addition, running pumps and compressors takes considerable energy. Thus the compromise used gives a single pass yield of around 15%.|$|E

25|$|Since {{electricity}} <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> utility, {{the first}} step towards conservation is to design a house and lifestyle to reduce demand. Fluorescent lights, laptop computers and gas-powered refrigerators save electricity, although gas-powered refrigerators are not very efficient. There are also superefficient electric refrigerators, such as those produced by the Sun Frost company, some of which use only about half as much electricity as a mass-market energy star-rated refrigerator.|$|E

25|$|Silk <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> material, and {{has been}} used for {{representative}} carpets. Its tensile strength has been used in silk warps, but silk also appears in the carpet pile. Silk pile can be used to highlight special elements of the design. High-quality carpets from Kashan, Qum, Nain, and Isfahan have all-silk piles. Silk pile carpets are often exceptionally fine, with a short pile and an elaborate design. Silk pile is less resistant to mechanical stress, thus, all-silk piles are often used as wall hangings, or pillows.|$|E
25|$|Surfactants are {{in demand}} {{for a wide range}} of {{industrial}} applications as they increase solubility, foaming capacity and lower surface tensions. In particular, rhamnolipids have been used broadly in the cosmetic industry for products such as moisturisers, condom lubricant and shampoo. Rhamnolipids are efficacious in bioremediation of organic and heavy metal polluted sites. They also facilitate degradation of waste hydrocarbons such as crude oil and vegetable oil by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The rhamnolipid surfactant itself is valuable in the cosmetic industry, and rhamnolipids are a source of rhamnose, which <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> sugar in itself.|$|E
25|$|Pure tin <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> {{and soft}} metal {{and it is}} not {{practical}} to use it alone. However, it could be alloyed with lead and copper to make pewter or alloyed with copper alone to produce bronze. Today's tinplate is mild steel electroplated with tin. Its non-rusting qualities make it an invaluable coating. However, its quality depends on the iron or steel being free from rust and the surface tin an unbroken coating. A piece of tinware may develop rust if the tin coating has worn away or been cut in the metal. The respective properties of the metals mean that corrosion once started is likely to be rapid.|$|E

25|$|In Haycraft's {{history of}} the {{construction}} equipment business (2000), he expressed the view that Allis-Chalmers relied too heavily for too long on partnering with auxiliary equipment suppliers, and acquiring them, instead of investing in in-house product development. In his view, this strategy limited the company's success in this business, and it eventually had to spend the development dollars anyway. Buescher's comments about the Buda acquisition {{and the need for}} subsequent improvement of its designs seem to corroborate this view. However, the topic is multivariate and complex; elsewhere in his memoir, Buescher presents a viewpoint in which investing in research and product development <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> move that often doesn't pay off for the innovator and mostly benefits competitor clones.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all of the}} TNF inhibitors, {{infliximab}} <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> medication, costing about US$900 for a 100mg dose, {{and within}} the United States is covered by almost every medical insurance plan (though caps on many plans {{make it possible to}} be covered for only a subset of treatments {{in the course of a}} year). Infliximab is supplied as a sterile, white, lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder, so must be reconstituted and administered by a health care professional, usually in a hospital or office setting. For this reason, it is usually covered under major medical insurance rather than prescription drug coverage. The loading regimen for all approved indications occurs at weeks 0, 2, and 6 at the above dosages.|$|E
25|$|Figure skating <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> sport. This is {{particularly}} {{due to the}} costs of ice time and coaching. In the late 1980s, the expenses of a top-ten ladies' competitor at the U.S. Championships reached nearly $50,000 a year. In October 2004, a U.S. Figure Skating article estimated the annual expense at $9,000-$10,000 for pre-juvenile, $18,000 for juvenile, $35,000-$40,000 for novice, and said junior and senior levels were somewhat more expensive. In the 2010s, American senior national medalists had expenses in the mid-five-figure range. Swiss skater Stéphane Lambiel said his costs were around 100,000 Swiss francs per season. World champion Patrick Chan's expenses were $150,000 (Canadian dollars). In 2015, CBC Sports estimated that a Canadian pair team had expenses of about CDN $100,000 per year.|$|E

25|$|Prior {{to final}} assembly, the {{manufacturers}} usually apply a thin coating of clear or colored acrylic lacquer or silver plate over the brass. The lacquer or plating serves {{to protect the}} brass from oxidation and maintains its shiny appearance. Several different types and colors of surface finish have been used over the years. It is also possible to plate the instrument with nickel or gold, {{and a number of}} gold-plated saxophones have been produced. Plating saxophones with gold <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> process because gold does not adhere directly to brass. As a result, the brass is first plated with silver, then gold. Some saxophonists, sellers, and repair technicians argue that the type of lacquer or plating or absence thereof may enhance an instrument's tone quality. The possible effects of different finishes on tone are difficult to isolate from the other variables that affect an instrument's tone colors. In any case, what constitutes a pleasing tone is a matter of personal preference.|$|E
25|$|As Frank Herbert's Dune (1965) begins, Duke Leto Atreides {{finds himself}} in a {{dangerous}} position; the 81st Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV has put him {{in control of the}} desert planet Arrakis, known as Dune, which is the only natural source of the all-important spice melange. The most valuable commodity in the known universe, the spice not only makes safe and reliable interstellar travel possible, but also prolongs life, protects against disease, and is used by the Bene Gesserit to enhance their abilities. The potential financial gains for House Atreides are mitigated by the fact that mining melange from the desert surface of Arrakis <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expensive</b> and hazardous undertaking, thanks to the treacherous environment and constant threat of giant sandworms which protect the spice. In addition, Leto is aware that Shaddam, feeling threatened by the rising power and influence of the Atreides, has sent him into a trap; failure to meet or exceed the production volume of their predecessors, the vicious House Harkonnen, will negatively affect the position of House Atreides in CHOAM, which relies on spice profits. Further, the very presence of the Atreides on Arrakis inflames the long-simmering War of Assassins between House Atreides and House Harkonnen, a feud ignited 10,000 years before when an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice after the Butlerian Jihad.|$|E

Further development took place in the 1920s and 1930s when new houses were built on the market gardens of North Sheen and {{in the first decade of}} the 21st century when considerably more river-fronting flats and houses were constructed by the Thames on land formerly owned by Thames Water.|$|E
2500|$|Adding a sail to {{a narrow}} hull like a canoe is a {{dangerous}} proposition, especially {{given the lack of}} dense materials like lead {{that can be used in}} a ballasted keel to counter the heeling moment of the sail.
