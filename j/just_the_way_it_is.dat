500|$|American Tragedy {{opens with}} the single [...] "Been to Hell". J-Dog said that the song is, [...] "the truth about what really happens to people when they move to L.A., to be actors or models or God knows what other {{delusions}} people have... failure. It's all too true, but most people aren't {{there to see it}} first-hand. But we are, so it's our interpretation of it all." [...] The track is followed by [...] "Apologize", a track that directly addresses critics and states the band's defiance in the face of negative opinions, as evident by the chorus, [...] "We don't apologize and that's <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> but we can harmonize even if we sound like shit." [...] Third is [...] "Comin’ in Hot", a party song and the album's fourth single that uses humor to describe what happens in night clubs. [...] "My Town" [...] is the fifth single and a mid-tempo song talking about Los Angeles and Hollywood. Next is [...] "I Don't Wanna Die", a song about the fear of death fueling the need to kill another person. [...] "Hear Me Now" [...] was the lead single from the album and is about the troubles each band member was going through at the time the song was written. The song's lyrics tell the story of a person who is depressed and hopeless, taking a very somber tone to the track. Despite this, the instruments and melodies contrast to make an uptempo track. Next is [...] "Gangsta Sexy", a party anthem song about heading to nightclubs and pursuing women. The following track, [...] "Glory", is a metal-inspired song which drew influence from war and fighting. [...] "Lights Out", the ninth song on the album, is about Deuce, ex-vocalist of Hollywood Undead. It is a response to [...] "Story of a Snitch". [...] "Coming Back Down", the third single released from the album, is a rock ballad song with acoustic guitars on the track. The lyrics describes about a story of an unknown loved one who has recently died, with the narrator having difficulty trying to live without them. [...] "Bullet", the eleventh track from the album, is an uptempo pop song about suicide. It is played in an upbeat tempo with energetic vocals, which gives contrast to the dark lyrical content. Rick Florino called the track, [...] "heart-wrenching genius". [...] "Levitate" [...] is an uptempo discothèque song about sex, while the verses of the song talk about suicide and alcoholism. It was also featured in the [...] trailer, [...] "Autolog Drift Challenge", {{as well as on the}} game's soundtrack, where it was ranked eighth on ProGamists list of [...] "Top ten songs featured in racing games".|$|E

That's why they give the biggest planets {{masculine}} names, and the little stars feminine ones--to even things up when it comes to getting their work in. Suppose they had called my star Agamemnon or Bill McCarty or something like that instead of Phoebe. Every time one of those old boys touched their calamity button and sent me down one of their wireless pieces of bad luck, I could talk back and tell 'em what I thought of 'em in suitable terms. But you can't address such remarks to a Phoebe.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Krantz advises {{emerging}} filmmakers {{to find a}} great {{writer to}} collaborate with. Filmmakers get hired based on material they control that established actors {{want to be involved}} with.

Everything takes time in the entertainment business, and that’s <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> In Krantz’s TV background, the writer is king. The script is fundamental to making a good movie, and he considers the writer as the key resource along with actors as a project is being executed by him as its director. [...] Film is widely known only as a “director’s medium,” but Krantz disagrees.|$|E

If I'm not upfront, that's totally cool, because I know I've been a part of all this." [...] He played his last concert with TNT in Umeå, Sweden on March 5, 2011.|$|E

5000|$|The Black Album {{represented}} {{a change in}} the career of the group and an expansion of their sound. AllMusic critic Ned Raggett noted that [...] "some of the numbers show the band following their original punk vein, but by this point the four...were leaving straight, three-chord thrash to the cul-de-sac revivalists", and that it was [...] "a chance for the band to try everything from straightforward rock to gentler atmospherics". Raggett described [...] "Wait for a Blackout" [...] as a [...] "dramatic psych/punk surge" [...] with [...] "overtly-serious goth affectations", and qualified [...] "Drinking About My Baby" [...] as [...] "goofy but still enjoyable". Captain Sensible later said that Dave Vanian's vocals were moving to a darker direction, and stated [...] "It is goth; we didn't set out to do that but that is <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> He did have a hearse, he was a grave digger".|$|E
5000|$|There are {{significant}} differences between the events of the novels and those of the series. In a February 2008 letter addressed to the fans, Terry Goodkind wrote, [...] "The nature of TV syndication requires that each week's episode be a story in itself, meaning that while the TV series will follow the background story of the book, it {{will not be able to}} follow the book exactly because there would be parts that would make an incomplete episode." [...] He later confirmed: Sam Raimi and his team want to keep the TV series true to my vision, so rest assured that I am going to be intimately involved in the writing of each of the episodes. If you love the book <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> then enjoy the book for what it is and come to the TV series prepared to enjoy the show for what it is.|$|E
