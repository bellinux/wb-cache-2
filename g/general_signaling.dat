50|$|Cooper Wheelock is a Long Branch, New Jersey, company {{founded in}} 1922 specializing in fire alarm and <b>general</b> <b>signaling</b> products. The company {{is known as}} an {{industry}} leader in fire and industrial signals. Cooper Wheelock products are often used by other companies (such as Honeywell) to complement their products.|$|E
50|$|Sometime in {{the late}} 1980s, Space Age {{introduced}} strobe versions of the AV32, AV34 and V33. Instead of using a dim incandescent light, it used a xenon strobe with a clear lens. The VA-series notification appliances were introduced in 1994, and ultimately replaced the AV32 series, which continued to be made until 1997. However, the V33 continued to be manufactured for <b>general</b> <b>signaling</b> purposes, and was replaced in 2006 by the Guardian Light.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{earliest}} signals produced by Wheelock were the A-1 series of AC-powered, dual-projector electromechanical horns. In the early 1970s, Wheelock introduced the 31 (AC-powered) and 34 (DC-powered) series of electromechanical horns. Around 1976, Wheelock created the 7001 (2-wire, flush-mount DC), 7002 (2-wire, surface-mount DC), 34+WS (4-wire, surface-mount DC), and 7004 (2-wire, surface-mount AC) electromechanical horn/strobes. These were the first fire alarm signals to use xenon strobes instead of incandescent lights. The horn and strobe on the 7001 and 7002 models are wired in series, causing the horn to stutter when the strobe flashes. Around 1983, Wheelock redesigned the horn's grilles, making them vandal resistant. This product line became extremely popular among third-party security companies, such as Honeywell, Ademco, and Cerberus Pyrotronics (now part of Siemens AG). In 1994, Wheelock discontinued this series, because their low-intensity strobes {{did not meet the}} new light distribution requirements of the ADA. The 31T is still in production today for <b>general</b> <b>signaling</b> purposes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{describe}} implementation aspects and performance {{results of a}} novel <b>general</b> <b>signaling</b> protocol for the Internet, the Cross-Application Signaling Protocol (CASP). There has been much debate on the applicability of RSVP as a <b>general</b> <b>signaling</b> protocol for the Internet, {{particularly with respect to}} its modularity, complexity, security and mobility support. Based on a layered architecture, the CASP design intends to address these challenges, which, unlike RSVP, provides a simpler mechanism for reliability and security by reusing existing protocols for transporting signaling messages. In addition, it supports a wide range of signaling applications. While this concept is considered to be advantageous over RSVP signaling, the actual mechanisms and behaviors of the CASP implementation have not yet been explored. Our study attempts to shed light on this issue by presenting a first public CASP implementation and preliminary examination of its properties. Performance results show and analyze the round trip times and their variances of signaling messages upon different number of signaling requests and different congestion situations in the experimental setup. The memory required for a large number of signaling sessions and the CPU consumption for each routine from profiling the implementation are low. Although further work is necessary, critical design choices in CASP have been proven useful and practically feasible. I...|$|E

40|$|An assay was {{developed}} to study plant receptor kinase activation and signaling mechanisms. The extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and transmembrane domains of the Arabidopsis receptor kinase BRI 1, which is implicated in brassinosteroid signaling, were fused to the serine/threonine kinase domain of XA 21, the rice disease resistance receptor. The chimeric receptor initiates plant defense responses in rice cells upon treatment with brassinosteroids. These results, which indicate that the extracellular domain of BRI 1 perceives brassinosteroids, suggest a <b>general</b> <b>signaling</b> mechanism for the LRR receptor kinases of plants.

40|$|Abstract. We study on-line play of {{repeated}} matrix {{games in which}} the observations of past actions of the other player and the obtained reward are partial and stochastic. We define the Partial Observation Bayes Envelope (POBE) as the best reward against the worst-case stationary strategy of the opponent that agrees with past observations. Our {{goal is to have}} the (unobserved) average reward above the POBE. For the case where the observations (but not necessarily the rewards) depend on the opponent play alone, an algorithm for attaining the POBE is derived. This algorithm is based on an application of Approachability theory combined with a worst-case view over the unobserved rewards. We also suggest a simplified solution concept for <b>general</b> <b>signaling</b> structure. This concept may fall short of the POBE. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{this article}} we show the {{relation}} between the theory of pulse shaping for WSSUS channels and the notion of approximate eigenstructure for time–varying channels. We consider pulse shaping for a <b>general</b> <b>signaling</b> scheme, called Weyl–Heisenberg signaling, which includes OFDM with cyclic prefix and OFDM/OQAM. The pulse design problem in the view of optimal WSSUS–averaged SINR is an interplay between localization and ”orthogonality”. The localization problem itself can be expressed in terms of eigenvalues of localization operators and is intimately connected to the concept of approximate eigenstructure of LTV channel operators. In fact, on the L 2 –level both are equivalent as we will show. The concept of ”orthogonality ” in turn can be related to notion of tight frames. The right balance between these two sides is still an open problem. However, several statements on achievable values of certain localization measures and fundamental limits on SINR can already be made as will be shown in the paper. I...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the optimal}} assertions {{approach}} of Benz and van Rooij (2007), conversational implicatures {{can be calculated}} {{based on the assumption}} that a given signal was optimal, i. e. that it was the sender's best choice if she assumes, purely hypothetically, a particular naive receiver interpretation behavior. This paper embeds the optimal assertions approach in a <b>general</b> <b>signaling</b> game setting and derives the notion of an optimal signal via a series of iterated best responses (cf. J¨ager, 2007). Subsequently, we will compare three different ways of interpreting such optimal signals. It turns out that under a natural assumption of expressibility (i) the optimal assertions approach, (ii) iterated best response and (iii) strong bidirectional optimality theory (Blutner, 1998, 2000) all prove equivalent. We then proceed to show that, if we take the iterated best response sequence one step further, we can account for M-implicatures (Horn's division of pragmatic labor) standardly in terms of signaling games...|$|E

40|$|Cell-fate {{specification}} of the R 7 photoreceptor cell {{is controlled by}} the sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase (SevRTK) and Ras 1, the Drosophila homologue of mammalian H-ras, K-ras and N-ras oncogenes. An activated form of Ras 1 expressed under control of the sevenless enhancer/promoter (sev-Ras 1 (V 12)) induces production of supernumerary R 7 photoreceptor cells, which causes the eye to become rough in appearance. To isolate mutations in genes functioning downstream of Ras 1, we carried out a screen for dominant suppressors and enhancers of this rough eye phenotype. Approximately 850, 000 mutagenized flies were screened, and 282 dominant suppressors and 577 dominant enhancers were isolated. Mutations in the Drosophila homologues of Raf, MEK, MAPK, type I Geranylgeranyl Transferase and Protein Phosphatase 2 A were isolated, as were mutations in several novel signaling genes. Some of these mutant genes appear to be <b>general</b> <b>signaling</b> factors that function in other Ras 1 pathways, while one seems to be more specific for photoreceptor development.

40|$|A {{new method}} for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{detection}} with soft-output, the partial marginalization (PM) algorithm, was recently proposed. Advantages {{of the method}} are that it is straightforward to parallelize, and that it offers a fully predictable runtime. PM trades performance for computational complexity via a user-defined parameter. In the limit of high computational complexity, the algorithm becomes the MAP demodulator. The PM algorithm also works with soft-input, but until now it has been unclear how to apply it for other modulation formats than binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) per real dimension. In this paper, we explain how to extend PM with soft-input to <b>general</b> <b>signaling</b> constellations, while maintaining the low complexity advantage of the original algorithm. © 2010 IEEE.
