500|$|To avoid {{confusion}} with Larter and Carter, Cook {{was required to}} dye her hair brown for the role. [...] "I like being a chameleon. It opens you up for so much more in this work. You don't get typecast," [...] Cook professed. Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly's relationship. [...] "It's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn’t want to go there, I guess. They did <b>go</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> in an earlier draft of the script but they didn’t want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, {{is a little bit}} of chemistry and you get the idea that through tragedy something good will come. So it ends in an optimistic way, that maybe they can be together but there’s no real love story," [...] Landes articulated.|$|E
500|$|A Thousand Leaves is the {{follow-up}} to Sonic Youth's 1995 album Washing Machine, which was released {{shortly after the}} band concluded their stint headlining the 1995 Lollapalooza music festival. With the money they had made at the festival, the band decided to build a recording studio, called Echo Canyon, on Murray Street in Lower Manhattan. The span of nearly three years between Washing Machine and A Thousand Leaves also represented the longest gap between studio albums in Sonic Youth's career at the time. Singer and guitarist Thurston Moore explained that the band needed a break, noting {{that they had been}} touring non-stop for 16 years. He said, [...] "We're having children, we're getting older, let's just cool out a little bit and build this workshop, and <b>go</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> work that route." [...] In their new studio, the band began writing new songs from extended improvisations in rehearsal. Several instrumental jams were released as extended plays through the band's own record label, Sonic Youth Recordings, and distributed by Smells Like Records, an independent record label previously formed by drummer Steve Shelley. These include , [...] and [...]|$|E
2500|$|Scheer {{had four}} main escape routes, which {{were known to}} both admirals. [...] He could change course away from the British fleet to the {{north-east}} and take a route through the Skagerrak channel north of Jutland back to safety in the Baltic. Although this might avoid the British, it was the longest route and risked some of his damaged ships sinking before reaching harbour. Jellicoe discounted the route, because of these considerations {{but also because the}} other escape routes all lay to the south, and he could not guard both directions. The longer route might also allow his faster ships to catch up the following day should Scheer <b>go</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

2500|$|... "My manager {{had never}} really {{wanted me to do}} X-rated film," [...] she said in 1997. [...] "He tried to move me out of that, but—seeing as things didn't <b>go</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and I wasn't getting {{legitimate}} projects—it was something that we needed to do. I was known in the X-rated business, and it was the right time. It was a cool story and the budget {{was going to be a}} lot higher; there were going to be helicopters and Ferraris. It was going to be very classy. There were some names in it that would be good for the box office, [...] and that was at a time when X-films were still playing in theaters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cast {{directors}} considered 1,800 teenagers {{from the}} United States, Canada, and Britain {{for the role}} of Max Fischer before finding Jason Schwartzman. In October 1997, approximately a month before principal photography was to begin, a casting director for the film met the 17-year-old actor at a party thanks to his cousin and filmmaker Sofia Coppola. He came to his audition wearing a prep-school blazer and a Rushmore patch he had made himself. Anderson almost did not make the film when he could not find an actor to play Max but felt that Schwartzman [...] "could retain audience loyalty despite doing all the crummy things Max had to do". Anderson originally pictured Max, physically, as Mick Jagger at age 15, to be played by an actor like Noah Taylor in the Australian film Flirting - [...] "a pale, skinny kid". When Anderson met Schwartzman, he reminded Anderson much more of Dustin Hoffman and decided to <b>go</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> with the character. Anderson and the actor spent weeks together talking about the character, working on hand gestures and body language.|$|E
2500|$|Larey {{then picked}} up Hollis' pants and pulled out his wallet and told the assailant, [...] "He doesn't have any money." [...] The assailant {{told her she was}} lying and that she had a purse. Larey told him that she did not and was knocked to the ground. She said she felt like she was hit with an iron pipe. The assailant ordered her to get up, and, when she did, he told her to run. As she ran towards a ditch, the assailant told her not to <b>go</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> but to run up the road. She stated that while she was running, she heard Hollis groaning, and that the man {{continued}} to beat and stomp him. She was having trouble running in her high heels when the assailant ran after her. She saw an older car parked further up the street facing their vehicle. She quickly looked inside to see if anyone could help her, but after seeing no one, she began to run and was overtaken by the attacker. The man asked her why she was running. She told him he told her to run. Larey said, [...] "He called me a liar again and then I knew {{that he was going to}} kill me." [...] He knocked her down and assaulted her sexually. Larey stated he did not rape her but abused her terribly. Later reports indicated that the assailant sexually assaulted her with the barrel of his gun.|$|E
