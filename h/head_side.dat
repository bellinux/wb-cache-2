25|$|The fell {{has seen}} {{extensive}} mining history. Dale Head Mine was driven below the northern crags for copper, several levels still being visible. Long Work was another copper mine {{a little further}} down the valley, worked for malachite and pyrite from Elizabethan times. On the southern flank of the fell, centred {{on the head of}} the pass, are the Honister Quarries. These are an extensive system of underground quarries, worked for Green Slate. The earliest extant records date from 1728 and since then huge caverns have been carved out {{on either side of the}} pass. The Yew Crag workings on the Dale <b>Head</b> <b>side</b> were operated until 1966, operations on the slopes of Grey Knotts continuing. In 1887 work began to drive a tunnel right under Dale Head into Newlands Valley, connecting with a proposed tramway to join the railway at Keswick. The scheme was abandoned after opposition from landowners. The main workers accommodation at the mine is now the Honister Hause Youth Hostel.|$|E

2500|$|President Barack Obama {{stated that}} the {{decision}} [...] "gives the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washington – while undermining the influence of average Americans who make small contributions to support their preferred candidates". Obama later elaborated in his weekly radio address saying, [...] "this ruling strikes at our democracy itself" [...] and [...] "I can't think of anything more devastating to the public interest". On January27, 2010, Obama further condemned the decision during the 2010 State of the Union Address, stating that, [...] "Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests – including foreign corporations – to spend without limit in our elections. Well, I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities." [...] On television, the camera shifted {{to a shot of}} the SCOTUS judges in the front row {{directly in front of the}} President while he was making this statement, and Justice Samuel Alito was frowning, shaking his <b>head</b> <b>side</b> to side while mouthing the words [...] "Not true".|$|E
