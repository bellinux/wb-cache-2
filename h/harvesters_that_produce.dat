Therefore, some biomechanical energy harvesting studies are conducted for reducing the dependence on batteries and developing the systems <b>that</b> <b>produce</b> energy by utilizing one's own actions during daily living activities. In this study, as {{a new approach to}} meet energy needs of active-controlled lower limb prostheses, the design of a biomechanical energy <b>harvester</b> <b>that</b> <b>produces</b> electrical energy from the movements of the knee joint during gait were carried out. This harvester is composed of the generator, planetary gear system and one-way clutch that transmit just the knee extension. Low weight, low additional metabolic power consumption requirement and high electrical power generation are targeted in design process. The total reduction ratio of the transmission is 104, and the knee joint reaction torque applied by the system is 6 Nm. Average electrical powers that can be obtained are 17 W and 5, 8 W for the swing extension phase and the entire cycle, respectively.

40|$|The Internet of Things (IoT) {{would add}} {{computational}} {{power to a}} plethora of ordinary objects. Potential applications are vast and vary in terms of maturity from sensors tracking energy usage to smart wearables and many more futuristic applications. A challenge shared by many of such small devices, {{in the order of}} a few centimeters in length and width, is battery and power. Cost, size, weight, and lifetime of the battery motivate alternative methods for providing energy to such devices. A practical Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) system which can power battery-less and charge coil-free smart everyday-objects has a tremendous potential to address this demand. In this work we offer a reliable solution. The 60 -GHz WPT system that is built in this project can be employed by any smart device which can be placed at a reasonably close distance to its power transmitter, without the alignment and proximity challenges which are associated with the magnetic charging solutions. The leading applications to benefit enormously from this new 60 -GHz WPT technology are miniature IoT devices, smart charge cards, business cards and IDs, smart posters, sensor fusion, and wireless flash memories. In this work, the first reported full-system 60 -GHz WPT solution which can power battery-less and charge coil-free compact smart devices is presented. The system is fabricated in a 40 -nm digital CMOS process and an inexpensive 500 -µm CCL-HL 832 MG antenna packaging material. The rectenna (RX) of this 60 -GHz WPT system consists of a grid antenna with a measured gain of 10. 7 dBi, integrated with a tuned complementary cross-coupled oscillator-like rectifier. It harvests DC power at a rate of 1 mW with a 28. 2 % RF-to-DC Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE). This PCE rate is significantly higher than the prior art and reaches 32. 8 % for 1. 4 mA output current. A novel theoretical analysis of the unique rectifier circuitry is presented which helps formulating all key specifications and identifying the design trade-offs. We present a cascode version of the energy <b>harvester</b> <b>that</b> <b>produces</b> higher DC output voltage and higher PCE in low current regime. The theoretical analysis and the results of the measurement for <b>that</b> <b>harvester</b> is also presented. The transmitter (TX) is equipped with a quad-core power amplifier which produces a total saturated output power (Psat) of 24. 6 dBm, which is the highest reported power delivery in digital CMOS technology at mm-wave bands. The TX peak PAE is 9. 4 %. The quad-core PA performs a 4 × 8 -way differential power combining and implements a binary-tree architecture by using power-splitting transformers which perform intra-stage matching too. The designed 2 × 2 grid array antenna helps the TX produce a peak EIRP level of 35. 3 dBm. The coupling between the TX and RX antennas within 4 cm spacing is between - 18. 9 and - 17. 4 dB. The results of full-system characterizations of the WPT solution and the measurements data of the individually-fabricated grid antennas, harvester, transmitter, and all building blocks are reported. Programmability in the input polarities of the quad-core PA offers output power control and beam-steering capabilities to this 60 -GHz WPT system. A four-input grid antenna is designed for the TX which in simulation shows an effective 70 ° beam-steering range in the broadside direction. In order to demonstrate how the design and implementation of all the 60 -GHz circuitry has been as successful as they are, the design of the VCOs, quadrature VCOs, PAs, unit-cell devices, pads and calibration circuitry, passive components like inductors, transformers, capacitors, the patch antennas, and the grid array antennas that have been done before the final implementation of the full wireless power transfer system are presented as well and the key design points are specified and explained. The architecture study for the transmitter and the energy harvester are also included in this dissertation since they have been most vital parts of accomplishing the design of the highest transmit power delivery and highest rectenna power conversion efficiency in digital CMOS technology. The 60 -GHz WPT system designed for this work can serve miniature sized smart everyday-objects which require milliwatt-level power delivery and work in contact-less and close-proximity distances. The full-system measurement results of the proposed 60 -GHz wireless power transfer solution demonstrate the suitability of this mm-wave WPT system for addressing the demand for wireless power of batteryless and coil-free devices with stringent size constraints of new applications, like the IoT...|$|R

40|$|As {{sources of}} energy are {{becoming}} more scarce and expensive, energy harvesting is receiving more global interest and is currently a growing field. Energy harvesting {{is the process of}} converting ambient energy, such as vibration, to electrical energy that can power a multitude of applications. Vibration energy is the by-product of everyday life; it is generated from any perceivable activity. While typically viewed as noise, there is a strong potential for harvesting this energy and deploying it to useful applications. The focus of this thesis will be using vibration as the ambient source of energy. Hybrid energy harvesters employ more than one of the harvesting technologies. In this thesis, two hybrid <b>harvesters</b> <b>that</b> utilize piezoelectric, magnetostrictive, and electromagnetic technologies are designed, modelled, and tested. Both of these <b>harvesters</b> have beams <b>that</b> are spiral in shape. The use of the spiral geometry allows the system to have a lower natural frequency as opposed to the traditional cantilever beam, while still maintaining a high volume of active material. The first <b>harvester</b> <b>that</b> is discussed is the P-MSM harvester. It utilizes piezoelectric and magnetostrictive material. Both materials are configured in a spiral beam geometry and allowed to resonate independently. The resonance frequency of these two materials is designed to create wideband energy harvesting. This allows the harvester to be operating efficiently even if the ambient vibration shifts a small amount. The second <b>harvester</b> <b>that</b> is discussed is the P-MAG harvester. It utilizes piezoelectric and electromagnetic technologies. It also incorporates a spiral geometry for the piezoelectric layers and includes a magnet attached at the centre. The magnet is placed in the centre of the spiral to reduce the natural frequency of the system and to also actively contribute to the harvesting. This harvester has two sources operating at the same resonant frequency, which allows it to have a larger power output than if the sources were separated. Finally, finite element analysis was used to model both harvesters. ANSYS was used for the piezoelectric material and COMSOL was used for the electromagnetic material. The results are compared to the experimental and are in good agreement. 4 month...|$|R
