25|$|Strong magnets {{are used}} to {{separate}} out ferrous metals, such as iron, steel, and tin cans. Non-ferrous metals are ejected by magnetic eddy currents in which a rotating magnetic field induces an electric current around the aluminum cans, which in turn creates a magnetic <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> inside the cans. This magnetic <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> is repulsed by a large magnetic field, and the cans are ejected {{from the rest of}} the recyclate stream.|$|E
25|$|Only five {{laminations}} or {{plates are}} shown in this example, so as to show the subdivision of the eddy currents. In practical use, the number of laminations or punchings ranges from 40 to 66 per inch, and brings the <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> loss down to about one percent. While the plates can be separated by insulation, the voltage is so low that the natural rust/oxide coating of the plates is enough to prevent current flow across the laminations.|$|E

Braking distance of a service stop under LZB control (0,5m/s²) from 250km/h is given as 4820m that of a fast braking (1,05m/s²) at 2300m. For braking all cars have disc brakes. Additionally, the power heads use regenerative brakes, the intermediate cars have electromagnetic track brakes. The power cars have spring-loaded parking brakes; intermediate cars use screw brakes for the same purpose. The bogies facilitate replacing the track brakes with <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> brakes.|$|E
25|$|A magnetically {{shielded}} room (MSR) model {{consists of three}} nested main layers. Each of these layers is made of a pure aluminium layer, plus a high-permeability ferromagnetic layer, similar in composition to molybdenum permalloy. The ferromagnetic layer is supplied as 1mm sheets, while the innermost layer is composed of four sheets in close contact, and the outer two layers are composed of three sheets each. Magnetic continuity is maintained by overlay strips. Insulating washers {{are used in the}} screw assemblies to ensure that each main layer is electrically isolated. This helps eliminate radio frequency radiation, which would degrade SQUID performance. Electrical continuity of the aluminium is also maintained by aluminium overlay strips to ensure AC <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> shielding, which is important at frequencies greater than 1Hz. The junctions of the inner layer are often electroplated with silver or gold to improve conductivity of the aluminium layers.|$|E
25|$|The disc is {{acted upon}} by {{two sets of}} coils, which form, in effect, a two phase {{induction}} motor. One coil is connected {{in such a way}} that it produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the voltage and the other produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the current. The field of the voltage coil is delayed by 90 degrees, due to the coil's inductive nature, and calibrated using a lag coil. This produces eddy currents in the disc and the effect is such that a force is exerted on the disc in proportion to the product of the instantaneous current, voltage and phase angle (power factor) between them. A permanent magnet acts as an <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> brake, exerting an opposing force proportional to the speed of rotation of the disc. The equilibrium between these two opposing forces results in the disc rotating at a speed proportional to the power or rate of energy usage. The disc drives a register mechanism which counts revolutions, much like the odometer in a car, in order to render a measurement of the total energy used.|$|E

40|$|The {{switching}} {{of magnetic}} field gradient coils in {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) inevitably induces transient <b>eddy</b> <b>currents</b> in conducting system components, such as the cryostat vessel. These secondary currents degrade the spatial and temporal performance of the gradient coils, and compensation methods are commonly employed to correct for these distortions. This theoretical study shows that by incorporating the <b>eddy</b> <b>currents</b> into the coil optimization process, {{it is possible to}} modify a gradient coil design so that the fields created by the coil and the <b>eddy</b> <b>currents</b> combine together to generate a spatially homogeneous gradient that follows the input pulse. Shielded and unshielded longitudinal gradient coils are used to exemplify this novel approach. To assist in the evaluation of transient <b>eddy</b> <b>currents</b> induced within a realistic cryostat vessel, a low-frequency finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method using the total-field scattered-field (TFSF) scheme was performed.

50|$|<b>Eddy</b> <b>currents</b> {{generate}} {{resistive losses}} that transform {{some forms of}} energy, such as kinetic energy, into heat. This Joule heating reduces efficiency of iron-core transformers and electric motors and other devices that use changing magnetic fields. <b>Eddy</b> <b>currents</b> are minimized in these devices by selecting magnetic core materials that have low electrical conductivity (e.g., ferrites) or by using thin sheets of magnetic material, known as laminations. Electrons cannot cross the insulating gap between the laminations and so are unable to circulate on wide arcs. Charges gather at the lamination boundaries, in a process analogous to the Hall effect, producing electric fields that oppose any further accumulation of charge and hence suppressing the <b>eddy</b> <b>currents.</b> The shorter the distance between adjacent laminations (i.e., the greater the number of laminations per unit area, perpendicular to the applied field), the greater the suppression of <b>eddy</b> <b>currents.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A bearing must (1) {{support a}} loading force (for example, {{the weight of}} a rotor) and (2) provide a force {{gradient}} (a restoring force) to hold the rotor in position.
