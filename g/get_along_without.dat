500|$|A {{real estate}} boom {{occurred}} in the U.S. {{after the end of}} the First World War, with a particular surge in the construction of new skyscrapers between 1925 and 1931. In New York, a quarter of the financial district was rebuilt between 1928 and 1931, with [...] of new office space added between 1925 and 1929 alone. In Chicago, limited wartime construction created supply shortages, and rent levels rose in response by around 100 percent between 1919 and 1924. This level of potential profits encouraged an explosion of new building projects in the city. The boom inflated prices in the real estate market, leading to speculative financing and building projects, including the introduction of 100 percent mortgages for new builds. An early edition of the Fortune magazine commented wryly that [...] "all a man needs to own a skyscraper is the money and the land.

500|$|In 1914, Jardine entered Winchester College. At the time, life at Winchester was arduous and austere; {{discipline}} was harsh. Sport {{and exercise}} were vital {{parts of the}} school day. In Jardine's time, preparing the pupils for war was also important. According to Jardine's biographer, Christopher Douglas, the pupils were [...] "taught to be honest, impervious to physical pain, uncomplaining and civilised." [...] All pupils were required to be academically competent and Jardine was able to <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>without</b> exhibiting brilliance; successful sportsmen, on the other hand, were revered. Jardine enjoyed a slightly better position than some pupils, already possessing {{a reputation as a}} cricketer and excelling at other sports; he represented the school at football as a goalkeeper and rackets, and played Winchester College football. But it was at cricket that he excelled. He was in the first eleven for three years from 1917 and received coaching from Harry Altham, Rockley Wilson and Schofield Haigh, the latter two of whom were distinguished cricketers. In 1919, his final year, Jardine came top of the school batting averages with 997 runs at an average of 66.46. He also became captain despite some doubts within the school about his ability to unify the team. Under Jardine, Winchester won their annual match against Eton College in 1919, a fixture in which Eton usually held the upper hand. Jardine's batting (35 and 89 in the match) and captaincy were key factors in his side's first victory over Eton for 12 years. After his retirement from cricket, he named his 89 in that match as his favourite innings. Jardine went on to score 135 not out against Harrow School.|$|E

2500|$|The {{tension between}} {{tradition}} and modern pressures {{in relation to}} marriage—and, by extension, within Japanese culture as a whole—is {{one of the major}} conflicts Ozu portrays in the film. Sorensen indicates by several examples that what foods a character eats or even how he or she sits down (e.g., on tatami mats or Western-style chairs) reveals the relationship of that character to tradition. According to Peña, Noriko [...] "is the quintessential moga—modan gaaru, 'modern girl'—that populates Japanese fiction, and really the Japanese imagination, beginning in the 1920s onward." [...] Throughout most of the film, Noriko wears Western clothing rather than a kimono, and outwardly behaves in up-to-date ways. However, Bordwell asserts that [...] "Noriko is more old-fashioned than her father, insisting that he could not <b>get</b> <b>along</b> <b>without</b> her and resenting the idea that a widower might remarry… she clings to an outmoded notion of propriety." ...|$|E
