In July 1689, William agreed to end Episcopacy since nearly 200 Episcopalian clergy had already been evicted, a policy strongly supported by the Presbyterian majority in Parliament. He continued to resist abolition of the Committee of the Articles before government defeat at the Battle of Killiecrankie led to Parliament being suspended on 2nd August.|$|E

The Zubu were located at the northwest border of Liao territory and had fought several wars with the Liao when the Liao tried to expand in that direction.
