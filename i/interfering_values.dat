The present study examined the subjective reality of living with dementia from the perspective of people with dementia within the 3 largest ethnic groups in the United Kingdom. Design and Meth-ods: This was a qualitative study in which in-depth individual interviews were conducted with 11 Black Caribbean, 9 south Asian, and 10 White British older people with dementia. The lack of information in this area prompted the use of a grounded theory approach.

At the same time, they seem to underlie many quantum oddities. In this article, we propose a simple explanation for counterfactuals, on two levels. Quantum Oblivion (QO) is a fundamental type of quantum interaction that we prove to be the origin of quantum counterfactuals. It also turns out to underlie several well-known quantum effects. This phenomenon is discussed {{in the first part of}} the article, yielding some novel predictions. In the second part, a hypothesis is offered regarding the unique spacetime evolution underlying QO, termed Quantum Hesitation (QH). The hypothesis invokes advanced actions and <b>interfering</b> weak <b>values,</b> as derived first by the Two-State-Vector Formalism (TSVF).

The hematological parameters analyzed were: total number of erythrocytes (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, hematological indices, platelet count, and total number of leucocytes. Additionally, we compared the collected parameters according to gender and age of the children studied. Results: A total of 203 CBC (100 girls and 103 boys) were evaluated. In general, no significant differences were observed in studied parameters between the values found in samples of DS children and the values described in the literature as a reference for children in this age group. No difference in the prevalence of anemia was observed in relation to gender (p = 0. 33), 14 / 103 (13. 6 %) boys, and 11 / 100 (11 %) girls had anemia.

40|$|Stomatal {{movement}} plays a {{key role}} in plant development and response to drought and salt stress by regulating gas exchange and water loss. A number of genes have been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of this process. Using inverse genetics approach, we characterized the function of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) vacuolar H(+) -ATPase subunit A (OsVHA-A) gene in stomatal conductance regulation and physiological response to salt and osmotic stress. OsVHA-A was constitutively expressed in different rice tissues, and the fusion protein of GFP-OsVHA-A was exclusively targeted to tonoplast when transiently expressed in the onion epidermal cells. Heterologous expression of OsVHA-A was able to rescue the yeast mutant vma 1 Δ (lacking subunit A activity) phenotype, suggesting that it partially restores the activity of V-ATPase. Meanwhile, RNAi-directed knockdown of OsVHA-A led to a reduction of vacuolar H(+) -ATPase activity and an enhancement of plasma membrane H(+) -ATPase activity, thereby increasing the concentrations of extracellular H(+) and intracellular K(+) and Na(+) under stress conditions. Knockdown of OsVHA-A also resulted in the upregulation of PAM 3 (plasma membrane H(+) -ATPase 3) and downregulation of CAM 1 (calmodulin 1), CAM 3 (calmodulin 3) and YDA 1 (YODA, a MAPKK gene). Altered level of the ion concentration and the gene expression by knockdown of OsVHA-A probably resulted in expanded aperture of stomatal pores and increased stomatal density. In addition, OsVHA-A RNAi plants displayed significant growth inhibition under salt and osmotic stress conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that OsVHA-A takes part in regulating stomatal density and opening via <b>interfering</b> with pH <b>value</b> and ionic equilibrium in guard cells and thereby affects the growth of rice plants...|$|R

To support resilience, agriculture needs to manage the land forgeneration of multiple ecosystem services. Analyses show that practices that practices whichhave been introduced in Potshini, a smallholder community in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africahave potential to increase crop yields, generate multiple ecosystem services and resilience ofthe area. However, these practices are adopted to a very low degree. Through informationgained with semi-structured interviews with farmers reasons for low adoption is found onseveral scales. Reasons directly causing abandonments are both physical constraints as lack ofresources and reasons on a mental /behavioral form resistance to change behavior and lack ofknowledge, factors appearing on the local scale. These factors are partly connected to arigidity to change caused by the South African social system in combination with poorconditions for smallholder commercialization. A low dependency on farming as livelihoodand few opportunities to use farming for income generation results in a low potential of usingproductivity increase as driver. Soft factors related to traditions and farmer values becomesincreasingly important as drivers why practices with implications on the traditional way offarming (like the introduced conservation agriculture) becomes harder than introduction ofpractices which does not <b>interfere</b> with farmer <b>values</b> and traditions.

In this qualitative study, 32 Surinamese primary care patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in semi-structured interviews (16 African Surinamese and 16 Hindustani Surinamese). Interviews were recorded and transcripts were analysed and coded into themes using principles of grounded theory and MAXQDA software. Results. Surinamese food was eaten regularly by all respondents. Most participants were aware of the need to change their diet but reported difficulty with changing their dietary behaviour to meet dietary guidelines. Many perceived these guidelines to be based on Dutch eating habits, making it difficult to reconcile them with Surinamese cooking and eating practices. Firstly, respondents indicated that they did not choose foods based on their nutritional qualities. Instead, choices were based on Surinamese beliefs regarding 'good' (e. g., bitter vegetables) or 'bad' (e. g., spicy dishes) foods for diabetes. Secondly, respondents often perceived recommendations such as eating at fixed times as <b>interfering</b> with traditional <b>values,</b> for example hospitality.

40|$|In imaging, {{saturation}} {{is a type}} of distortion {{where the}} recorded image is limited to some maximum <b>value,</b> <b>interfering</b> with the measurement of bright regions of the scene. Background The role of a sensor element is to measure incident irradiance and record that quantity as an image inten-sity value. However, physical constraints limit the maximum irradiance that can be measured for a given camera setting. In the absence of noise, the mapping from irradiance to image intensity is fully described by the radiometric response function, a monotonically increasing function whose range is restricted by the maximum irradiance. Pixels whose intensity corre-sponds to this maximum are known as saturated. Saturated pixels contain less information about the scene than other pixels. While non-saturated pixels can be related to the incident irradiance by applying the inverse of the radiometric response function, satu-rated pixels provide only a lower bound on irradiance. Therefore, estimating the irradiance of saturated pixels is similar to other image “hallucination ” tasks such as inpainting [2]. Since many computer vision algorithms assume a linear relationship between sensor irradiance and the measured image intensity, it is important to identify saturated pixels and handle them appropriately. In practice, saturated pixels are often treated as missing values or otherwise ignored. Theory In the idealized noise-free case, the image intensity M of a pixel can be described as mapping the inci-dent irradiance I according to the radiometric response function f. /, limited by the maximum irradiance Imax, M D f. min. I; Imax/ / : (1) For an irradiance of Imax or higher, the image inten-sity will saturate at its maximum value of Mmax D f. Imax/. Since saturated pixels do not have unique cor-responding irradiance values, they provide no direct information about incident irradiance beyond imposing a lower bound of Imax...|$|R

The birds were inoculated when they were 5 days old and the euthanasia was performed 24 hours before and after infection and 3, 5, 7 and 10 days after the administration of the inoculum. In each day of collection, blood samples were obtained for biochemical tests of the blood serum besides macroscopic and histopathological examination of the birds. Data were submitted to analysis of variance by the SAS statistical program and the means were compared by Tukeýs test (P< 0, 05). In the serum biochemical profile it was observed that the infection <b>interfered</b> in the <b>values</b> of total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphorus, cholesterol, triglycerides, GGT and ALT in the infected groups.

Intracellular water (ICW) was calculated as the difference between TBW and ECW. The observed findings for the series as a whole showed no change in blood volume, an increase of 3. 7 I in ECW, and a decrease of 1. 5 I in ICW as compared to predicted values based on current weight. Compared to predicted values based on normal (pre-illness) weight, the observed body weight decreased 16 % and ICW decreased 22 %; this suggests that body weight consistently under-estimates the extent of nutritional depletion. Severe depletion seen in postoperative patients indicates that frequently earlier use of total parenteral nutrition would be beneficial. ICW {{was found to be}} the most reliable single index of moderate or severe nutritional depletion; errors in estimating normal <b>values</b> <b>interfere</b> with its use in mild depletion. The ratio of ECW:TBW best reflects distortion of body water composition; it is largely independent of weight, and is a more sensitive index than absolute values of ICW. Repeat measurements of body composition were made on 9 patients given total parenteral nutrition for an average period of 18 days. On the average, there was an ECW decrease of 1. 8 I, a body weight increase of 2 kg, and an ICW increase of 3. 2 I after parenteral nutrition. The increased ICW represents the repletion of half of the average initial deficit of 6. 1 The initial ratio of ECW:TBW of 0. 58 was reduced to 0. 50, returning it about three-quarters of the way to the expected normal value of 0. 48. Intravenous administration of 5 % glucose as sole source of calories may be a factor in distortion of body water compartments...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the critical speed (CS) determined from different distances with the anaerobic threshold (AnT) and the maximum speeds in tests of 20 (S 20) and 30 (S 30) minutes, and to check if the chronological age of young swimmers can influence these relations. 31 swimmers (17 girls and 14 boys) participated in this study, divided by chronological age into two groups: 10 - 12 and 13 - 15 years. The AnT was determined as the velocity corresponding to 4 mM of blood lactate. The CS 1 (25 / 50 / 100 m), CS 2 (100 / 200 / 400 m), and the CS 3 (50 / 100 / 200 m) had been calculated through the slope of the linear regression between the distances and their respective times. The S 20 and S 30 were determined through 3 to 6 trials, with blood collections at the 10 th min and at the end of each test. For the 10 - 12 group, CS 1 (m/s) (0. 98 ± 0. 17) and AnT (0. 97 ± 0. 12) were not different, being higher than CS 2 (0. 92 ± 0. 16), CS 3 (0. 89 ± 0. 18), S 20 (0. 92 ± 0. 11) and S 30 (0. 90 ± 0. 11). For the 13 - 15 group, CS 1 (m/s) (1. 11 ± 0. 11) was higher than AnT (1. 02 ± 0. 07), S 20 (0. 99 ± 0. 09), S 30 (0. 97 ± 0. 09), CS 2 (0. 98 ± 0. 11) and CS 3 (1. 00 ± 0. 11). It can be concluded that the distance used for the determination of CS <b>interferes</b> on its <b>value,</b> irrespective of the chronological age. CS determined with distances between 50 and 400 m can be used for evaluation of the aerobic capacity of children and adolescents, substituting the maximum continuous tests of 20 or 30 minutes...|$|R
40|$|After {{defining}} terms, Part I {{lays out}} the law and economics case against privacy, including its basis in economic thought more generally. Part II canvasses the literature responding to economic skepticism in the privacy law literature. Some scholars mount an insider critique, accepting the basic tenets of economics but suggesting that privacy actually increases efficiency in some contexts, or else noting that markets themselves will yield privacy under the right conditions. Others critique economic thinking from the outside. Markets “unravel” privacy by penalizing it, degrade privacy by treating it as just another commodity, or otherwise <b>interfere</b> with the <b>values</b> or processes that privacy exists to preserve. Part III tells the love story from the Article’s title. I develop here a novel account {{of the relationship between}} privacy and markets, positioning the two concepts as sympathetic instead of antithetical. Neither insider nor outsider, the framework understands privacy as a crucial ingredient of the market mechanism, while simultaneously demonstrating how markets enable privacy to achieve its most important functions. It turns out opposites attract, just as Hollywood has been telling us all along. The final Part discusses what’s at stake. First, at the descriptive level, this Article sheds light on certain institutional puzzles such as why the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC” or “the Commission”) —an agency dedicated to free markets and brimming with economists—would arise as the de facto privacy authority for the United States. The Article’s framework not only explains and perhaps justifies the FTC’s role in policing privacy, but also predicts other agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will increasingly become involved in privacy enforcement. Second, at the level of discourse, the Article opens up new avenues of analytic inquiry, previously obscured by a mutual skepticism. In particular, the framework helps surface the role of privacy in avoiding market discrimination {{for the simple reason that}} it hides many objects of potential bias. And third, normatively, this Article argues in support of laws and policies, such as conditioning access to political databases on non-commercial use, that try to keep personal information out of markets...|$|R
40|$|Plectranthus sp. pertence à família Lamiaceae e inclui cerca de 300 espécies. Duas delas, P. {{barbatus}} (PB) e P. ornatus (PO) destacam-se pelo interesse medicinal. As principais substâncias encontradas em Plectranthus sp. são os diterpenóides, óleos essenciais e compostos fenólicos. A melhor forma de utilizar as folhas de PB e PO é a fresco; porém, na comercialização há necessidade de recorrer a processos de secagem. Entretanto, isto pode interferir no princípio ativo, desta forma, estudos para determinar o melhor método gravimétrico são importantes. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar qual o melhor método de secagem, onde haja maior perda de água possível, e calcular os rendimentos dos extratos visando avaliar se o método gravimétrico interfere na quantidade de extrato produzido. Desta forma, utilizou-se quatro métodos de secagem e após evaporação do solvente, fez-se o cálculo do rendimento dos extratos secos. O percentual de água foi superior em PB e PO (média geral de 90, 12 ± 8, 22 %). Dentre as secagens, em estufa de ventilação forçada (EVF) foi mais eficiente em PB (88, 87 %) e em estufa convencional (ECO) foi melhor em PO (95, 13 %). O maior rendimento do extrato seco em PB foi na secagem em camada delgada (CD) (20, 96 %), enquanto que em PO foi ECO (41, 34 %). Não houve correlação entre o método de secagem e o rendimento de extrato obtido. Plectranthus sp. {{belongs to}} the family Lamiaceae and includes about 300 species. Two of them, P. barbatus (PB) and P. ornatus (PO), have medicinal interest. The main substances found in Plectranthus sp. are the diterpenoids, essential oils and phenolic compounds. The best way to use the leaves of PB and PO is cool; but for marketing {{there is a need}} of resort to drying processes. However, this may <b>interfere</b> on the <b>values</b> of active principle; thus, studies to determine the best gravimetric methods are important.

To this was done by drying four different methods ventilated dry (EVF), conventional drying (ECO), microwave (MCO) and layer thing (CD) and after evaporation of the solvent, was made the calculation the percentage of the dried extract. The water content was higher in PB and PO (overall average of 90. 12 ± 8. 22 %). Among the drying, EVF was more efficient for PB (88. 87 %) and ECO was better for PO (95. 13 %). The highest content of dry extract was for PB in to CD (20. 96 %), whereas for PO was in to ECO (41. 34 %).

40|$|Investigou-se a influência de íons metálicos Al(III), Ca(II), Fe(III), Pb(II), Cu(II) e Cr(III) (10 - 6 a 10 - 3 mol L- 1 na intensidade relativa de fluorescência (IRF) do ácido húmico (AH, 10 mg L- 1). os íons Cu(ii), Pb(II) e Cr (III) produziram um efeito de supressão, enquanto os íons Fe(III), Al(III) e Ca(II) não influenciaram significativamente nos valores de IRF. A partir dos valores de IRF foram calculadas a constante de estabilidade (K) dos complexos e a capacidade complexante do AH com Cu(II), Pb(II) e Cr(III). Os valores de K seguiram a ordem: Cr(III) > Pb(II) > Cu(II) e a capacidade complexante: Cr(III) ~ Pb(II) > Cu(II). Desenvolveu-se um novo método analítico baseado na reação quimiluminescente da oxidação do AH com peroxomonosulfato de potássio (PMS; 0, 6 mol L- 1 > ácido fúlvico > ácido húmico > {{resorcinol}} > ácido pirogálico > catecol > hidroquinona. Desta forma, como polifenóis existem na estrutura de substâncias húmicas, acredita-se que essas porções da molécula devem ser as responsáveis pela produção de quimiluminescência. The {{influence of}} Al(III), Ca(II), Fe(III), Pb(II), Cu(II), and Cr(III) metal ions (10 - 6 to 10 - 3 mol L- 1) {{on the relative}} fluorescence intensity (RFI) of humic acid (HA, 10 mg L- 1) was investigated. Cu(II), Pb(II), and Cr(III) ions produced a quenching effect, while Fe(III), Al(III), and Ca(II) ions did not significantly <b>interfere</b> with RFI <b>values.</b> Stability constants (K) and complexing capacities of HA with Cu(II), Pb(II), and Cr(III) were obtained using RFI values. Stability values of complexes followed the order: Cr(III) > Pb(II) > Cu(II) and the complexing capacity values: Cr(III) ~ Pb(II) > Cu(II). 	 A new analytical method was developed based on the chemiluminescent oxidation of HA by peroxymonosulfate (PMS; 0. 6 mol L- 1) in basic medium (NaOH 1. 0 mol L- 1). The intensity of radiation emission (Imax) and area vs. time were linear functions of HA concentration range of 0. 5 - 20 mg L- 1. The detection limit was 0. 24 mg L- 1. A comparative study was conducted using H 2 O 2 (0. 58 mol L- 1) {{in the presence of}} CH 2 O (0. 44 mol L- 1) in basic medium (NaOH 0. 16 mol L- 1). The detection limit was 0. 4 mg L- 1 of HA. 	 The addition of Cl-, NO 3 -, PO 43 -, CO 32 -, Fe(III), Cu(II), Cr(III), and Ca(II) to the chemiluminescent reaction of HA with PMS did not interfere with the signal. 	 The addition of 50 mg L- 1 Co(II) or Mn(II) (as EDTA complexes or chloride salts) to the HA sample enhanced radiation emission, due to the formation of strong oxidant species such as SO 5 o-, SO 4 o-, and HOo during PMS decomposition reaction. This method was applied to determine HA concentration in a sample of river water (Miranda River - MS), obtaining values between 2. 9 and 12. 3 mg L- 1. Oxidation reactions of some organic compounds by PMS in basic medium were studied, which produced radiation emission. Polyphenols produced the highest emissions and the area values followed the order: phloroglucinol> fulvic acid> humic acid> resorcinol> pyrogalic acid> cathecol> hydroquinone. Since polyphenolic groups are supposed to exist within humic acid structure, those portions of the molecule {{are most likely to be}} responsible for that chemiluminescence...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{the work}} of Estonian journalists can be defined as follows: changes in professionalism (professional {{training}} and experience, specialisation in a specific topic, professional skills); organisational changes (the division of work in the editor´s office, the relationships between the editors and the reporters, customary practices prevalent in an organisation), technological changes (technical ability, multi-skills) and the changes in freedom of professional choice (professional autonomy: the freedom to choose the topic and the point of view, the nature of control prevalent in editor’s office). The changes are especially evident in the field of professionalism. After the reign of young and inexperienced journalists (so-called juvenile reporters) there was a certain degree of professionalisation, but the last few decades have witnessed a decrease in specialisation among the journalists. They are rather oriented towards mass audience, drawing on a certain genre (news). From a professional point of view this could be seen as a setback. A closer look at the organisational changes seems to support the author’s hypothesis that editor’s offices in Estonia are editor-centered and use quite a considerable amount of control. The journalists’ workload tends to be high, whereas their freedom of choice is rather small. Moreover, the results confirmed the assumption that freedom of professional choice is less important for the journalists than before. Interviews with experts also confirmed the hypothesis that transition from the controlled system to the system of free journalism had considerably stronger influence on Estonian journalists than subsequent technological revolution. The only significant contribution of technological revolution seems to be online journalism, which has become the main tool undermining the culture of professional journalism. The new job of a web reporter has made it increasingly easy for inexperienced journalists to enter the professional field and created a new wave of juvenile journalists, which is not as numerous as in 1990 s, but still there. The application of web-based approaches to newspaper-making has left its print on traditional quality requirements and customary working practices. 106 The study also confirmed the hypothesis of generation gap, which seems to be charateristic to transitional countries and divides journalists into pre-revolution and post-revolution generations. Like in other countries, it is commonly believed that the older generation follows the professional and societal values more closely, the younger generation, on the other hand, is less inclined to let the professional <b>values</b> <b>interfere</b> with their careers (Metyakova, Cisarova, 2009). Experts believe that professional culture has experienced some setbacks and a number of strong personalities have moved away from journalism. The experts describe present-day journalism and present-day journalists as “mediocre”, “loyal to their bosses”, “irresponsible”, “not interested in their main characters” and “a lot of nobodies”. Experts agree that American practices and hierarchical and controlled culture prevalent in editor’s office are editor-centered. Experts also believe that editors are in many cases technical workers who have no professional skills and whose actions are based on business logic. Some experts think that the professional quality of Estonian editors is below standard. The study also supported the assumption that format and layout have considerable influence on journalists’ thinking. As regards changes like continuous reorganisation of editorial work, the effect of economic thinking on journalism, frequent changes in design, format-centeredness, template as an agent changing journalistic thinking, the domination of routine practices over creative work (Kunelius, Ruusunoksa, 2008), dependence on format and its influence on the quality of journalism seemed to have the greatest effect. The influence of economic thinking on editor’s work is less evident for journalists, but it is still possible to experience it at the level of self-censure. In conclusion we can say that the character of Estonian journalism has undergone considerable changes, which have brought about generational differences, made the representatives of pre-revolution generation move away from journalism and created a new wave of young and inexperienced web reporters, which has resulted in deprofessionalisation. The relationships in editor’s office have become more hierarchical and more individualistic, whereas journalists have become less creative. It should be noted that transition to free journalism is not yet finished for Estonian journalists and 107 Estonian journalism, since a number of qualitative and professional values have not yet been achieved, or their development has stopped due to the economic downturn. The process of turning journalism into commercial production, or to the so-called box factories needs to be slowed down. It is high time to understand that instead of bits of information we need competent analysis and added value to the info...|$|R
