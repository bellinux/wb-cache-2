5|$|After the war, Magoffin {{returned}} to his legal practice and engaged in agricultural pursuits in Harrodsburg. A series of land speculation ventures near Chicago, Illinois made him very wealthy. He encouraged his fellow Kentuckians to accept {{the results of the}} war. He advocated for civil rights <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> and urged passage of the Thirteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|During Congressional Reconstruction, U.S. General John Schofield {{administered}} Virginia as Military District One. After 1866, {{according to}} the Radical Reconstruction Acts, a rebelling state which had vacated its delegation in the U.S. Congress was required to incorporate the 14th Amendment into its state constitution before it was allowed to participate again. By the time Schofield called a new state constitutional convention for 1868, three distinct parties had coalesced in Virginia. Radical Republicans, including most ex-slave freedmen, organized to advocate full political and social equality <b>for</b> <b>blacks,</b> but they wanted to exclude ex-Confederates from political participation either in government or at the ballot box. Moderate Unionists including many pre-war Whigs, sought political equality <b>for</b> <b>blacks,</b> but believed that ex-Confederates had {{to be included in}} the political community because of their majority in the white population. Conservatives wanted to ensure white control of the state without Radical influence on issues such as public education.|$|E
5|$|Early public {{education}} in Meridian {{was based on the}} 1870 Mississippi Constitution. From 1870 to 1885, trustees appointed by the City Council served on the Board of School Directors, which had authority to operate the schools. Although there were several schools in the city before 1884, they were privately owned and only enrolled about 400 students. The city did not build its first publicly owned school until September 1884. The first public school <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> in the city was held in facilities rented from St. Paul Methodist Church. The Mississippi Legislature amended the city charter in January 1888 to allow the city to maintain its own municipal school district, and in March of the same year $30,000 in bonds was approved for the city to build new public schools. From this bond, the Wechsler School was built in 1894, becoming the first brick public school building in the state built <b>for</b> <b>blacks.</b>|$|E

5|$|Knott's most {{successful}} initiatives {{were in the}} area of education. Under his leadership, the state established a normal school <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> in Frankfort and created a state teacher's organization.

5|$|Meridian {{is served}} by the Meridian-Lauderdale County Public Library, located {{at the corner of}} 7th Street and 26th Avenue. The city {{originally}} had two Carnegie libraries, both built in 1913 – one <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> and one for whites. A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970, and the former African-American library was demolished on May 28, 2008.|$|E
5|$|The later 19th {{century was}} a high point {{in the history of}} civil rights for African Americans. Reconstruction for a time limited the power of former slaveholders in Texas. Leaders, such as George T. Ruby and Norris Wright Cuney, worked to {{establish}} educational and employment opportunities <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> and organize black voters to support the Republican Party, then the main party supporting black rights in the South. Cuney's efforts led to higher employment and higher wages <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> in the city, especially on the wharves, and eventually led to combined black and white trade unions during the 1890s and early 1900s. Cuney himself rose to the chairmanship of the Texas Republican Party, the most powerful position held by any black American in the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Although Du Bois {{generally}} endorsed socialist principles, {{his politics}} were strictly pragmatic: in 1929, Du Bois endorsed Democrat Jimmy Walker {{for mayor of}} New York, rather than the socialist Norman Thomas, believing that Walker could do more immediate good <b>for</b> <b>blacks,</b> even though Thomas' platform was more consistent with Du Bois's views. Throughout the 1920s, Du Bois and the NAACP shifted support {{back and forth between}} the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, induced by promises from the candidates to fight lynchings, improve working conditions, or support voting rights in the South; invariably, the candidates failed to deliver on their promises.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Ryan Tillman (August 11, 1847– July 3, 1918) was a {{politician}} of the Democratic Party {{who served as}} Governor of South Carolina from 1890 to 1894, and a United States Senator from 1895 {{until his death in}} 1918. A white supremacist who opposed civil rights <b>for</b> <b>blacks,</b> Tillman led a paramilitary group of Red Shirts during South Carolina's violent 1876 election. On the floor of the U.S. Senate, he frequently ridiculed blacks, and boasted of having helped to kill them during that campaign.|$|E
5|$|DuBois rose to {{national}} prominence {{as the leader}} of the Niagara Movement, a group of African-American activists who wanted equal rights <b>for</b> <b>blacks.</b> DuBois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta compromise, an agreement crafted by BookerT. Washington which provided that Southern blacks would work and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic educational and economic opportunities. Instead, DuBois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation, which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite. He referred to this group as the Talented Tenth and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} and pervasive problems facing contemporary American society concerns the alarmingly high rates of joblessness suffered by inner-city African-American youth. Rates of black youth unemployment and joblesness far exceed those of white youth. For the year 1995, the unemployment rate <b>for</b> <b>black</b> youth workers between 16 and 19 years of age approximately 37 percent <b>for</b> young <b>black</b> men and 34 percent <b>for</b> young <b>black</b> women. Furthermore, the rate of joblesness stood at 75 percent <b>for</b> <b>black</b> male youth and 74 percent <b>for</b> <b>black</b> female youth. In contrast, the comparable unemployment rates for white male and white female youth were 15 and 13 percent, respectively, while the corresponding rates of joblessness were 49 and 48 percent...|$|R

5|$|During the post-Civil-War period, {{leaders such}} as George T. Ruby and Norris Wright Cuney, who headed the Texas Republican Party and {{promoted}} civil rights for freedmen, helped to dramatically improve educational and employment opportunities <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> in Galveston and in Texas. Cuney established his own business of stevedores and a union of black dockworkers to break the white monopoly on dock jobs. Galveston was a cosmopolitan city {{and one of the}} more successful during Reconstruction; the Freedmen's Bureau was headquartered here. German families sheltered teachers from the North, and hundreds of freedmen were taught to read. Its business community promoted progress, and immigrants stayed after arriving at this port of entry.|$|E
5|$|Newspapers {{in major}} {{international}} cities and Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and socialist publications reported outrage about the verdict and strong criticism of American society.

5|$|The now {{independent}} association maintained the racial segregation with four separate associations. After consultation with Baden-Powell, four separate Scouting organisations {{were created in}} 1936. These were The Boy Scouts Association (for whites), The African Boy Scouts Association (<b>for</b> <b>blacks),</b> The Coloured Boy Scouts Association (for coloureds) and The Indian Boy Scouts Association (for Indians). A revision of the 1936 constitution in 1953 even strengthened the whites-only branch: its Chief Scout was now Chief Scout of the three other associations, with each association providing a Chief Scout's Commissioner as executive head under the Chief Scout.|$|E
5|$|The {{private sector}} {{was not the}} only source of racism: under President Wilson, the plight of African Americans in {{government}} jobs suffered. Many federal agencies adopted whites-only employment practices, the Army excluded blacks from officer ranks, and the immigration service prohibited the immigration of persons of African ancestry. Du Bois wrote an editorial in 1914 deploring the dismissal of blacks from federal posts, and he supported William Monroe Trotter when Trotter brusquely confronted Wilson about Wilson's failure to fulfill his campaign promise of justice <b>for</b> <b>blacks.</b>|$|E
5|$|The strenuous {{campaign}} took {{a decisive}} toll on Helm's already weakened body. He {{was too weak}} to travel to Frankfort for his inauguration, so the oath of office was administered at his home on September 3, 1867. Helm's secretary of state read the governor's inaugural address at the Hardin County Courthouse. In it Helm repeated his intent to remove political disabilities from ex-Confederates. He also charged that Congress was meddling in the affairs of the states. Though he promised protections <b>for</b> <b>blacks,</b> he opposed the idea of black suffrage.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Beaty {{returned}} to Cincinnati {{and raised his}} family. His son, A. Lee Beaty, became an Ohio state legislator and an assistant U.S. District Attorney for southern Ohio. He resumed {{his career as a}} turner and pursued amateur acting and public speaking engagements. He gave public readings for charitable causes and became a well-known elocutionist among the African American community of Cincinnati. Through the 1870s he acted in local theaters and directed music and drama exhibitions in the city. He wrote a play about a rich southern planter entitled Delmar, or Scenes in Southland, which was performed in January 1881 with himself in the lead role. Set in Kentucky, Mississippi, and Massachusetts, the work covered the end of slavery and transition to freedom <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> from 1860 to 1875. The privately run play was well received, but Beaty did not engage in self-promotion and it never moved into public theaters.|$|E
5|$|As a Republican in {{a heavily}} Democratic state, Bradley found little success {{early in his}} {{political}} career. He was defeated for {{a seat in the}} United States House of Representatives and in the United States Senate twice each. After rising to national prominence with his speech seconding the presidential nomination of Ulysses S. Grant at the 1880 Republican National Convention, he was nominated for governor in 1887. Although he lost the contest to Simon Bolivar Buckner, he reduced the usual Democratic majority substantially. He was again nominated for governor in 1895. Capitalizing on divisions in the Democratic Party over the issue of free silver, he defeated Parker Watkins Hardin in the general election. His term was marked by political struggles and violence. He was an advocate <b>for</b> <b>blacks</b> and did much to advance their status in the state, but was unable to enact much of his reform agenda because of a hostile Democratic majority in the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|As the United States {{prepared}} to enter World War I in 1917, Du Bois's colleague in the NAACP, Joel Spingarn, established a camp to train African Americans {{to serve as}} officers in the United States military. The camp was controversial, because some whites felt that blacks were not qualified to be officers, and some blacks felt that African Americans should not participate in what they considered a white man's war. Du Bois supported Spingarn's training camp, but was disappointed when the Army forcibly retired one of its few black officers, Charles Young, on a pretense of ill health. The Army agreed to create 1,000 officer positions <b>for</b> <b>blacks,</b> but insisted that 250 come from enlisted men, conditioned to taking orders from whites, rather than from independent-minded blacks {{that came from the}} camp. Over 700,000 blacks enlisted {{on the first day of}} the draft, but were subject to discriminatory conditions which prompted vocal protests from Du Bois.|$|E
