We found that the flushing of large volumes of accumulated sediment had clear effects on the stream ecosystem due to the unpredictability of short duration SSC peaks (70 - 80 g L(- 1)) and the high average SSC (4 - 5 g L(- 1)) within flushing periods. The main impacts were decreased fish densities (up to 73 %) and biomass (up to 66 %). A greater mortality recorded for juveniles will likely result in long-term impairment of the age-structures of future fish populations. The zoobenthic assemblages, despite exhibiting a drastic reduction in abundance following the first floods, showed substantial recovery within 3 months of the beginning of <b>flushing</b> <b>operations.</b> Regular sediment removal by yearly flushing is recommended in order to avoid SSC peaks and to facilitate the control of scouring effects caused by the water used to wash out sediments.

40|$|International audienceSewer {{deposits}} {{have been}} identified as a major cause of dysfunctions in combined sewer systems regarding sewer management, which induces different negative consequents resulting in poor hydraulic conveyance, environmental damages as well as worker’s health. In order to overcome the problematics of sedimentation, flushing has been considered as the most operative and cost-effective way to minimize the sediments impacts and prevent such challenges. Flushing, by prompting turbulent wave effects, can modify the bed form depending on the hydraulic properties and geometrical characteristics of the conduit. So far, the dynamics of the bed-load during high-flow events in combined sewer systems as a complex environment is not well understood, mostly due to lack of measuring devices capable to work in the “hostile” in combined sewer system correctly. In this regards, a one-episode flushing issue from an opening gate valve with weir function was carried out in a trunk sewer in Paris to understanding its cleansing efficiency on the sediments (thickness: 0 - 30 cm). During more than 1 h of flushing within 5 m distance in downstream of this flushing device, a maximum flowrate and a maximum level of water have been recorded at 5 m in downstream of the gate as 4. 1 m 3 /s and 2. 1 m respectively. This paper is aimed to evaluate the efficiency of this type of gate for around 1. 1 km (from the point - 50 m to + 1050 m in downstream from the gate) by (i) determining bed grain-size distribution and sediments evolution through the sewer channel, as well as their organic matter content, and (ii) identifying sections that exhibit more changes in their texture after the flush. For the first one, two series of sampling were taken from the sewer length and then analyzed in laboratory, one before flushing and second after, at same points among the sewer channel. Hence, a non-intrusive sampling instrument has undertaken to extract the sediments smaller than the fine gravels. The comparison between sediments texture after the <b>flush</b> <b>operation</b> and the initial state, revealed the most modified zones by the flush effect, regarding the sewer invert slope and hydraulic parameters in the zone up to 400 m from the gate. At this distance, despite the increase of sediment grain-size rages, D 50 (median grain-size) varies between 0. 6 mm and 1. 1 mm compared to 0. 8 mm and 10 mm before and after flushing, respectively. Overall, regarding the sewer channel invert slope, results indicate that grains smaller than sands (< 2 mm) are more transported to downstream along about 400 m from the gate: in average 69 % before against 38 % after the flush with more dispersion of grain-sizes distributions.

40|$|Globally {{there are}} about 50, 000 large dams and among them 25, 500 are the storage {{reservoirs}} with storage volume of about 6, 464 Bm 3. Worldâ€™s annual reservoir storage loss in different regions due to sedimentation varies between 0. 08 - 2. 3 %, {{with an average of}} about 0. 6 %. It is estimated that in 2030 the demand of water would be 8500 Bm 3, but the existing storage would be around 7000 Bm 3. To meet 1500 Bm 3 shortfall, about 8100 reservoirs are needed and construction of so many reservoirs in future seems to be difficult. The only solution is to conserve the existing reservoirs by enhancing their lives by adopting appropriate measures. Various methods employed globally to conserve storage capacities of reservoirs arewatershed management, conventional dredging, dry excavation, hydrosuction, sediment routing/sluicing, sediment bypassing, density current venting, and sediment flushing through the reservoir, used independently or in combination. Present study focuses on the <b>flushing</b> <b>operation</b> to enhance the lives of reservoirs and toanswer several questions related to <b>flushing</b> <b>operation,</b> like, is reservoir flushable?, if yes, then what would be the flushing efficiency?, how many times in a year it should be flushed?, when it should be flushed?, how much would be the flushing discharge required?, how much should be the duration of flushing?, how much water would be sacrificed for the <b>flushing</b> <b>operation?,</b> and what would be the recovery in capacity of the reservoir considering the <b>flushing</b> <b>operation?,</b> etc. <b>Flushing</b> is a method by which the flow velocities in a Reservoir are increased to such alevel that deposited sediments are mobilized and transported through low level outlets in the dam. Flushing sediments through reservoirs has been practiced successfully and found to be inexpensive in many cases, however, a significant amount of water is required during <b>flushing</b> <b>operation.</b> Hence, there is need to numerically model the flushing scenarios to check the performances of reservoirs in restoring the reservoir capacities. Flushing probably has been implemented on many hundreds reservoirs of the world, but in literature only about 50 reservoirs are documented as flushed, and flushing data is available for only 25 reservoirs. Among them in literature about 6 reservoirs had been reported as successfully flushed i. e. Baira-India, Gebidem-Switzerland, Gmund-Austria, Hengshan-China, Palagnedra-Switzerland, and Santo-Domingo-Venezuela reservoirs. Various flushing indicators used to assess the feasibility of sediment flushing from reservoirs are Sediment Balance Ratio-SBR, Long Term Capacity Ratio-LTCR, Drawdown Ratio-DDR, Sediment Balance Ratio during full drawdown-SBRd, Flushing Width Ratio-FWR and Top Width Ratio-TWR. The usually adopted critical values of these indicators are: SBR > 1, LTCR approaching to unity, DDR > 0. 7, SBRd > 1, FWR > 1 and TWR = 1 - 2. In the present study, the values of these six flushing indicators were computed for the selected 14 flushed reservoirs of various regions of the world and were compared with their critical values. Out of 14 selected reservoirs, 6 were successfully flushed and 08 were partially flushed. From the analysis it was found that for successfully flushed reservoirs critical values of all six flushing indicators were satisfied, but for the partially flushed reservoirs critical values were also satisfied except for the Flushing Indicator LTCR. It shows the significance of LTCR over the other Flushing Indicators. So it was learnt that LTCR is the most important flushing indicator among the six indicators to assess the feasibility of sediment flushing through the reservoirs. Analysis results of the 14 reservoirs also show that among the successfully flushedreservoirs maximum value of LTCR is 1 for Santo-Domingo and Palagnedra Reservoirs, whereas, Hengshan Reservoir has the least value of LTCR, i. e., 0. 77, which is a successfully flushed reservoir, hence it was concluded that the critical value of LTCR may be taken as 0. 77 instead of 1 for the successfully flushed reservoirs. Equations were developed for SBR and LTCR by Multiple Non-linear Regression Analysis, using the data of six successfully flushed reservoirs. These equations were tested on foreign and Pakistani reservoirs and the comparison revealed that developed equations results match well with the results of Atkinson equations. To get confidence in numerically simulating the <b>flushing</b> scenarios, <b>flushing</b> <b>operations</b> were modeled for three successfully flushed reservoirs for which data of entire flushing activities were available to calibrate and validate the Flushing Models. To numerically simulate <b>flushing</b> <b>operations,</b> initially these three reservoirs were modeled for the sediment deposition processes. These reservoirs are Baira of India, Gebidem of Switzerland and Gmund of Austria. Flushing processes have been modeled using three Models, i. e. SHARC, HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0, and Tsinghua University Equation. Results of the study show that SHARC Model well simulates the sediment deposition processes, but it underestimates the flushing durations. Results of the HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0 Model show that it can well simulate sediment depositions and sediment <b>flushing</b> <b>operations.</b> Then Tsinghua University Equation was used for simulating the sediment <b>flushing</b> <b>operations</b> through these three reservoirs. Results of the Tsinghua University Equation reveal that Model well simulates sediment <b>flushing</b> <b>operations</b> through these reservoirs. All small reservoirs of Punjab Small Dams Organization (SDO) of Pakistan were investigated, and 20 reservoirs were selected based on detailed data availability to assess their feasibility for sediment flushing. The results reveal that based on the computed Flushing Indicators, 5 reservoirs can be ranked as likely to be successfully flushed, these are Jammargal, Phalina, Dharabi, Talikna, and Jabbi reservoirs. Among the five likely to be successfully flushed reservoirs, Jabbi reservoir having 3. 8 Mm 3 storage capacity was selected for modeling the sediment deposition and flushing processes. Jabbi Reservoir was created after the construction of Dam across Jabbi Nullah by the end of year 1990. Hydrographic survey of the reservoir was conducted after 10 years of operation in 2000, which was used for the validation of the sediment deposition process in the reservoir. The survey results show that sediment deposition in 10 years was about 0. 418 Mm 3. As results of the flushing modeling on the three foreign reservoirs proved that HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0 and Tsinghua University Equation well simulate the flushing processes, hence <b>flushing</b> <b>operations</b> of Jabbi Reservoir were modeled using two Models i. e. HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0 and Tsinghua University Equation, under two scenarios, i. e. flushing after one year and ten years of sediment deposition. Results of the both the Models and both the options for sediment deposition show good agreement with the observed deposited sediments. A complete <b>flushing</b> <b>operation</b> includes the emptying of reservoir, flushing the sediment through the reservoir and refilling of the reservoir. Considering the results of complete <b>flushing</b> <b>operation</b> it was estimated that refilling time required for the reservoir is about 64 % of the year as inflows to the reservoir are intermittent, hence annual flushing of the reservoir looks infeasible, however, large quantity of water for the <b>flushing</b> <b>operation</b> of the reservoir may be sacrificed after 10 years. HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0 and Tsinghua University Model Results were used to formulate the complete strategy for flushing the reservoir. Model results revealed that for flushing the Jabbi Reservoir after 10 years deposition, appropriate flushing months are July and August; suitable flushing discharge is 3 cumecs; time required to empty the reservoir is 0. 34 day; time required to refill the reservoir is 235 days; flushing duration required to flush 10 years deposited sediments is about 4 days; average flushable sediment diameter is 10 mm; and water required for flushing the reservoir would be about 4. 4 Mm 3.

40|$|The Langmann {{reservoir}} {{is part of}} the hydropower {{system in}} the river Teigitsch and in the reservoir loss of storage volume occurs. The reservoir was therefore flushed, but recently no permission is granted. The reason is the high sediment concentrations that have negative effects on the downstream region. An optimization of the <b>flushing</b> <b>operations</b> that reduces the negative effects and recovers most of the storage volume is required. Hence, insight in the <b>flushing</b> <b>operations</b> and identification of the key processes that determine the flushing efficiency are required. The reservoir is flushed by creating a riverine flow. The key processes that occur during flushing are classified as progressive erosion, retrogressive erosion and bank erosion. The <b>flushing</b> <b>operations</b> are in the maintenance phase; a channel is already formed and only recently deposited sediments are flushed out of the channel. A large peak in the sediment concentration at the transition of drawdown to riverine flow occurs. The Delft 3 D software is able to simulate the processes except for bank erosion. Bank erosion can be added to the model through an application that is under development. The model is very sensitive to the grid cell size, due to the small dimensions of the flushing channel. It is advised to decrease the grid cell size and to confine the grid to the flushing channel and the near surroundings as most erosion occurs within this area. The model also experiences problems in the water balance. The problems are caused by the rapid changes in water level, discharge and bottom level, but can be solved by adding and subtracting water to the model. The amount of sediment removed from the reservoir is underestimated. Data for calibration and verification are missing and therefore only the sensitivity to parameters that might increase the erosion is investigated. A measurement plan is set up in order to obtain the required data. The peak concentration is not shown in the model and so the model can not be used properly yet, to simulate different strategies that are implemented to minimize the sediment concentrations. Even though the model does not fully simulate the observed hydrological and morphological changes, it is felt that an important first step is taken in simulating the <b>flushing</b> <b>operations.</b> For the optimisation of the <b>flushing</b> <b>operations</b> a tube system combined with auxiliary channels that drain laterally is recommended.

The downstream ecological consequences of 4 controlled free-flow <b>flushing</b> <b>operations</b> designed to remove sediments accumulated in an Alpine reservoir are described. Sediment removals were carried out for analogous duration and in the same period of the year from 2006 to 2009. Brown trout populations were remarkably reduced after the beginning of <b>flushing</b> <b>operations,</b> but appeared to reach equilibrium with the new environmental conditions. Macroinvertebrate fauna, despite exhibiting a significant reduction in abundance and biomass following each flushing, showed a quick recovery within 3 months. Nevertheless, the yearly occurrence of sediment flushing changed the taxa composition, allowing species with fast life cycle and good colonizing ability to become dominant. Particle size analysis of core samples collected in riffle habitats provide evidence of a significant increase in interstitial fine sediment, that could adversely affect the recovery processes. Maximum allowable SSCs of 10 g L- 1 (daily average) and 5 g L- 1 (overall average) for <b>flushing</b> <b>operations</b> carried out in small to medium high-gradient Alpine streams are recommend. In the same river network, a data set (n= 30) of free-flowing and altered flow streams was used to detect the effects of water diversion on macroinvertebrate communities using single and multimetric indices as well multivariate approaches. Although macroinvertebrate diversity decreased significantly in response to reduced flows, the results suggest that invertebrate-based metrics may be poor descriptors of the magnitude of flow reduction. A consistent pattern in the dataset was demonstrated through multivariate analysis by groups of taxa that were respectively reduced or increased in abundance at the impaired sites, confirming that diversions are potentially responsible for a change in macroinvertebrate composition. The findings of this research showed how both activities have the potential to alter biological communities, but even that could be managed together to minimize risks.

A reliable prediction of the environmental effects of sediment flushing is hindered by the limited scientific information currently available. Consequently, there may be some controversy as regards to management decisions, planning the work, and monitoring strategies. This paper summarizes the main results of a monitoring campaign on the stream below a small alpine hydropower reservoir subjected to annual flushing between 2006 and 2009. The removed sediment was essentially silt, and the suspended solid concentration (SSC) of the discharged water was controlled to alleviate downstream impact. Control was achieved through hydraulic regulation and mechanical digging, alternating daytime sediment evacuation, and nocturnal clear water release. The four operations lasted about two weeks each and had an average SSC of about 4 g L- 1. Maximum values of SSC were generally kept below 10 g L - 1. Downstream impact was quantified through sampling of fish fauna (brown trout) and macroinvertebrate in the final reach of the effluent stream. The benthic community was severely impaired by the <b>flushing</b> <b>operations,</b> but recovered to pre-flushing values in a few months.

The studies have indicated that the sluices provided in the dam to flush the sediment deposits in the reservoir are effective given the [...] "duration and degree to which the reservoir is drawn down and on the discharge capacity of the sluices" [...] and also the shape of the reservoir, which in the case of Cachi is in a narrow gorge. Studies indicated that the average diameter of the sediments deposited in the reservoir was of the order of 0.04 mm. It was also noted that on the terraces of the reservoir flushing was not very effective since they were covered with water hyacinths which had trapped the sediments. The old river channel also had indicated a deposit rate of about 2 m, which, however, is now regularly flushed out by opening the scouring sluice.|$|R
40|$|The first {{results of}} the {{biological}} and hydraulic monitoring programme carried out during the sediment flushing of an Alpine Italian reservoir are presented. The flushing and the monitoring activities were planned and executed by several private and public subjects, including the hydroelectric company {{in charge of the}} reservoir management (AEM S. p. A.), local environmental agencies, an angler association, a company of environmental consultancy (Graia S. r. l.), the Insubria university. The Italian normative requires that the sediment removal from a reservoir should follow a Reservoir Management Plan compiled by the reservoir manager (which is also in charge for the execution of the <b>flushing</b> <b>operation).</b> Difficulties arise in planning such operations since no threshold limits for the suspended solid (SS) concentration of the outflow waters are defined at National level. For this reason the present research was addressed to provide experimental evidence of the SS effects on the aquatic biota present in the creek downstream of the flushed reservoir, aiming at establish ecologically-based threshold limits of SS concentration. A second objective of the research was to verify how much the effluent SS concentration could be controlled by means of technical <b>operations</b> for <b>flushing</b> management...|$|R
40|$|The {{graduation}} thesis {{addresses the}} subject of elaborating an efficient flushing program for the water distribution system of Šmartno ob Paki. Due to the occurrence of material deposition at low velocity sections in a water distribution system {{there is a constant}} risk of water discoloration. There are several methods available for coping with the accumulated material and its management, to prevent the occurrence of water discolouration. From the reviewed methods, I have chosen the method of unidirectional flushing. This method has proven to be most efficient, according to literature sources, and cost-effective in removing accumulated material and its prevention against water discoloration occurrence. The essence of this method is a systematic approach towards planning, implementing and documenting of <b>flushing</b> <b>operations,</b> which does not leave many factors to coincidence. Within the graduation thesis, I have performed a study of the Šmartno ob Paki water distribution system. I have updated the hydraulic model of the mentioned water distribution system using the Aquis water network simulation software. An efficient flushing program for a problematic part of the Šmartno ob Paki water distribution system was elaborated by means of this hydraulic model {{and the use of the}} unidirectional flushing method...|$|R
40|$|Storage {{capacity}} of hydropower reservoirs is lost due to sediment deposition. The problem is severe in projects located on rivers with high sediment concentration during the flood season. Removing the sediment deposition hydraulically by drawdown flushing {{is one of}} the most effective methods for restoring the storage capacity. Effectiveness of the flushing depends on various factors, as most of them are site specific. Physical/mathematical models can be effectively used to simulate the <b>flushing</b> <b>operation,</b> and based on the results of the simulation, the layout design and operation schedule of such projects can be modified for better sediment management. This paper presents the drawdown flushing studies of the reservoir of a Himalayan River Hydroelectric Project called Kotlibhel in Uttarakhand, India. For the hydraulic model studies, a 1 : 100 scale geometrically similar model was constructed. Simulation studies in the model indicated that drawdown flushing for duration of 12 h with a discharge of 500 m(3) /s or more is effective in removing the annual sediment deposition in the reservoir. The model studies show that the sedimentation problem of the reservoir can be effectively managed through hydraulic flushing...|$|R
50|$|The {{emergence}} of burst buffer fosters {{a wide variety}} of solutions to accelerate the scientific data movement on supercomputers. For example, scientific applications' life cycles typically alternate between computation phases and I/O phases. Namely, after each round of computation, all the computing processes concurrently write their intermediate data to the back-end storage systems. With the deployment of burst buffer, processes can quickly write their data to burst buffer after one round of computation, and immediately proceed to the next round of computation; the data are then asynchronously flushed from burst buffer to the storage systems at the same time with the next round of computation. In this way, I/O time is shortened by the overlapped computation and data <b>flush</b> <b>operations.</b> In addition, buffering data in burst buffer also gives applications plenty of opportunities to reshape the data traffic to the back-end storage systems for efficient bandwidth utilization of the storage systems. In another common use case, scientific applications can stage their intermediate data in and out of burst buffer without interacting with the slower storage systems. Bypassing the storage systems allows applications to relish most of the performance benefit from burst buffer.|$|R

40|$|Night purge {{ventilation}} is {{an effective}} technique for passive cooling, which is typically used in office buildings {{with the aim of}} reducing the daytime temperature, and thereby reducing the cooling load of HVAC systems. This method uses the cool of the night to release the warmth stored in the thermal mass during the day. That is, this system optimizes the energy storage properties of thermal masses to provide thermal comfort in interior spaces. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the impact of the use of night purge ventilation in conjunction with PCMs on the indoor thermal conditions of a typical office building located in hot-arid climates. In this article, the impacts of optimal night ventilation on the heat <b>flushing</b> <b>operation,</b> inside room temperature and element thermal conditions are all evaluated. It was found that combining PCMs with night ventilation will significantly improve indoor thermal conditions; however, results vary for different days in general and different structural elements in particular. Moreover, the application of PCMs can reduce night ventilation system problem of occupants feeling cold in the morning, whereas in the majority of work hours the temperature of inside element faces is approximately 0. 5 °C lower than the room temperature, both of which improve thermal comfort.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} {{by the desire to}} provide an efficient and scal-able software cache implementation of OpenMP on multicore and manycore ar-chitectures in general, and on the IBM CELL architecture in particular. In this paper, we propose an instantiation of the OpenMP memory model with the fol-lowing advantages: (1) The proposed instantiation prohibits undefined values that may cause problems of safety, security, programming and debugging. (2) The proposed instantiation is scalable with respect to the number of threads because it does not rely on communication among threads or a centralized directory that maintains consistency of multiple copies of each shared variable. (3) The pro-posed instantiation avoids the ambiguity of the original memory model definition proposed on the OpenMP Specification 3. 0. We also introduce a new cache protocol for this instantiation, which can be implemented as a software-controlled cache. Experimental results on the Cell Broadband Engine show that our instantiation results in nearly linear speedup with respect to the number of threads for a number of NAS Parallel Benchmarks. The results also show a clear advantage when comparing it to a software cache design derived from a stronger memory model that maintains a global total order-ing among <b>flush</b> <b>operations.</b> ...|$|R
