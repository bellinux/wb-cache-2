40|$|The {{variation}} in the concentration and the turbulent fluxes of dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus (DON and DOP) across the thermocline in the central Atlantic were studied along a quasi-meridional transect from the Canary Islands to Argentina (22 �N to 31 �S). In general, DON concentrations were high in surface waters and declined toward the thermocline, whereas DOP concentrations were less variable with depth. Vertical, gradientdriven fluxes of DON and DOP generally involved a <b>downward</b> <b>flux,</b> with a median DON: DOP ratio of 28 : 1. The <b>downward</b> <b>flux</b> of DON was closely correlated with the nitrate supply to the mixed layer and sufficed to remove an amount of nitrogen equivalent to that associated with the upward nitrate influx into the mixed layer (median � 104 %). The <b>downward</b> <b>flux</b> of DON exceeded the supply of nitrate off the NW African coast, where Trichodesmium sp. was abundant. The <b>downward</b> <b>flux</b> of DOP was also very closely correlated with the phosphate supply to the mixed layer (r � 0. 87; P � 0. 0007), but the downward export of phosphorus as DOP accounted for only 9 % of the upward phosphate supply to the mixed layer. There was also evidence of a deep upward flux of DON and DOP from below the thermocline, which, combined with the general <b>downward</b> <b>flux</b> in the upper waters, indicates {{the presence of a}} strong sink for DON and DOP within the thermocline, tentatively identified to be microplankton respiration.

The result showed {{that both the}} 72 h averaged upward <b>flux</b> and <b>downward</b> <b>flux</b> of zonal momentum were negative at nearly each height, meaning that the upward flux was dominated by westward propagating waves while the <b>downward</b> <b>flux</b> was dominated by eastward propagating waves.

It is also observed that the vertical flux of zonal momentum tended to be small in each frequency band at the altitudes below the jet maximum (10 ~ 12 km), and the flux increased toward more negative values to reach a negative maximum at some altitude well above the jet maximum. Daily averaged flux showed tremendous variation: The 1 st 24 h (quiet day) was relatively quiet, and the fluxes of the 2 nd and 3 rd 24 h (active days) increased sharply. Moreover, the upward fluxes of zonal momentum below 17 km in the quiet day for each period band (10 ~ 30 min, 30 min~ 2 h, 2 ~ 7 h, and 7 ~ 24 h) were dominantly positive, while the corresponding <b>downward</b> <b>fluxes</b> were dominantly negative, meaning that the zonal momentum below 17 km in each period band under study were dominantly eastward (propagating along the mean wind).

A unified treatment of solar and terrestrial radiation is obtained by using identical cloud and haze parameterization procedure for the shortwave and longwave region.

Snow conditions of the arctic region are simulated in terms of snow grain sizes and soot contamination in the surface layers. Data from the Arctic Stratus Cloud Experiment collected in 1980 are used for model comparisons and sensitivity studies under cloudy and hazy sky conditions. During the arctic summer, stratus clouds are a persistent feature and decrease the <b>downward</b> <b>flux</b> at the surface by about 130 - 200 W me 2. Arctic haze in the summertime is important if it is above the cloud layer or in air with low relative humidity, and it decreases the <b>downward</b> <b>flux</b> at the surface by about lo- 12 W me 2. By comparison the greenhouse effect of doubling the carbon dioxide amount increases the <b>downward</b> <b>flux</b> at the surface by about 4 - 7 W me 2 and can be offset by the background haze or {{by an increase in}} cloudiness of about 4 %. Assuming steady microstructures of stratus clouds, we find that in late June a clear sky condition results in more available <b>downward</b> <b>flux</b> for snow melt (yielding a melting rate of 9. 3 cm day-‘) than does a cloudy sky condition (6 cm day-‘).

We have constructed one-dimensional thermosphere/ionosphere models for high solar activity for seven solar zenith angles (SZAs) in the dusk sector: 90 °, 95 °, 100 °, 105 °, 110 °, 115 ° and 125 °. For the first 4 SZAs, we determine the optical depths for solar fluxes from 3 Å to 1900 Å by integrating the neutral densities numerically along the slant path through the atmosphere. For SZAs of 90 °, 95 °, and 100 °, we first model the ionospheres produced by absorption of the solar fluxes alone; for 95 °, 100 °, and 105 ° SZAs, we then model the ion density profiles that result from both the solar source and from imposing <b>downward</b> <b>fluxes</b> of atomic ions, including O+, Ar+, C+, N+, H+, and He+, {{at the top of the}} ionospheric model in the ratios determined for the upward fluxes in a previous study of the morphology of the dayside (60 ° SZA) Venus ionosphere. For SZAs of 110 °, 115 ° and 125 °, which are characterized by shadow heights above about 300 km, the models include only <b>downward</b> <b>fluxes</b> of ions. The magnitudes of the <b>downward</b> ion <b>fluxes</b> are constrained by the requirement that the model O+ peak density be equal to the average O+ peak density for each SZA bin as measured by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter Ion Mass Spectrometer.

A small <b>downward</b> <b>flux</b> of ions is therefore required to reproduce the measured average peak density of O+. We find that, on the nightside, the major ion density peaks do not occur at the altitudes of peak production, and diffusion plays a substantial role in determining the ion density profiles.

40|$|<b>Downward</b> solar <b>fluxes</b> {{measured}} at Dungsha coral island (20 deg. 42 min. N, 116 deg. 43 min. E) during the South China Sea Monsoon Experiment (May-June 1998) have been calibrated and compared with radiative transfer calculations for three clear-sky days. Model calculations use water vapor and temperature profiles from radiosound measurements and the aerosol optical thickness derived from sunphotometric radiance measurements at the surface. Results {{show that the}} difference between observed and model-calculated <b>downward</b> <b>fluxes</b> is less than 3 % of the daily mean. Averaged over the three clear days, the difference reduces to 1 %. The <b>downward</b> surface solar <b>flux</b> averaged over the three days is 314 W per square meters from observations and 317 W per square meters from model calculations, This result is consistent with a previous study using TOGA CAORE measurements, which found good agreements between observations and model calculations. This study provides an extra piece of useful information on the modeling of radiative transfer, which fills in the puzzle of the absorption of solar radiation in the atmosphere...|$|R

Simulated ADCP vertical velocity fields from the foray-type scenario resembled field observations, {{particularly with regard to}} the occurrence of positive anomalies in deeper waters and negative anomalies in shallower waters. The model illustrates that active vertical flux of zooplankton FP can occur at high latitudes even when no synchronised VM is taking place...|$|R
40|$|The {{interplay of}} moist {{convection}} and particle {{growth in the}} tropopause region of the atmospheres of earth, Uranus, and Neptune has been investigated. It is found that the <b>downward</b> <b>flux</b> of aerosols {{is not sufficient to}} dehydrate the earth's stratosphere by chemical dessication, and that the source of Neptune's oversaturated stratosphere is convective penetration of the tropopause by moist convective columns of methane. It is shown that conditions in the troposphere of Uranus are not conducive to the initiation of moist convection...|$|R
40|$|The high {{altitude}} plasma instrument, i. e., five electrostatic analyzers, {{on board the}} DE 1 satellite obtained data on electron conical distributions during two nightside auroral zone passes and one polar cap pass. The southern orbit apogee was 675 km, the northern, 24, 000 km. Electrons confined {{to the outside of}} the loss cone were the highest energy particles detected. The upward integrated flux was greater than the <b>downward</b> <b>flux,</b> indicating the presence of a heating process perpendicular to the geomagnetic field...|$|R
40|$|A {{two year}} record of <b>downward</b> {{particle}} <b>flux</b> was obtained with moored sediment traps at several {{depths of the}} water column in two regions characterized by different primary production levels (mesotrophic and oligotrophic) of the eastern subtropical North Atlantic Ocean {{in the framework of}} the EUMELI program. Settling particles were collected with multisample conical sediment-traps moored at 1000 and 2500 depths in the water column. Time-series samples were obtained between February 1991 and November 1992. During this time, sampling intervals varied from 8 to 10 d and were synchronized at all depths and also between the oligotrophic and mesotrophic moorings. Sediment-trap sampling procedures were consistent with JGOF and described elsewhere. The data shown here are mass, particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate inorganic carbon (PIC), coccolithophore, opal, and lithogenic <b>downward</b> <b>fluxes</b> obtained during the entire sediment-trap deployments at both sites...|$|R
30|$|Chen et al. (2011) used SAMI 2 {{model to}} {{simulate}} the WSA, and they identified various causal mechanisms. Their major findings about WSA formation are as follows: the equatorward neutral wind is the critical driver, the plasmaspheric <b>downward</b> <b>flux</b> is another driver but not a critical one, and both the magnetic offset and the declination of the magnetic field are very important. All these results suggested various possible physical drivers that {{may contribute to the}} formation of the WSA, but their relative importance is not clearly identified.|$|R
40|$|The present 1 D {{model of}} the nightside {{ionosphere}} of Venus assumes that ionization is maintained by day-to-night transport of atomic ions. Attention {{is given to the}} sources and sinks for molecular ions. If the ionosphere is primarily maintained by transport, the ratio of the peak densities of O(+) and O 2 (+) indicates the <b>downward</b> <b>flux</b> of O(+), independent of the absolute magnitudes of the densities.
