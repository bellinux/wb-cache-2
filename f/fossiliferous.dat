5|$|All {{specimens}} discovered until 1967 were in coarse-grained sandstone {{that prevented}} preservation of fine details, making interpretation difficult. S.B. Misra's discovery of <b>fossiliferous</b> ash-beds at the Mistaken Point assemblage in Newfoundland changed all {{this as the}} delicate detail preserved by the fine ash allowed the description of features that were previously undiscernible.|$|E
5|$|Carboniferous Period (359–299 {{million years}} ago) rocks are {{represented}} by the Carboniferous Limestone that forms the Mendip Hills, rising abruptly out of the flat landscape of the Somerset Levels and Moors. The limestones are very <b>fossiliferous,</b> and contain evidence of the abundant marine life that existed {{at the time of}} their creation, including fossil crinoids (sea-lilies), corals and brachiopods.|$|E
5|$|Excavations at {{the quarry}} were stopped in 1881, {{although}} it was not exhausted of fossils, as recent drilling operations have shown. During World War I, when the town was occupied by German forces, preparations were made to reopen the mine for palaeontology, and Otto Jaekel was sent from Berlin to supervise. The Allies recaptured Bernissart just as the first <b>fossiliferous</b> layer was about to be uncovered. Further attempts to reopen the mine were hindered by financial problems and were stopped altogether in 1921 when the mine flooded.|$|E
5|$|In current practice, the Marcellus Formation(abbr. Dm or Dms) is {{classified}} as the basal unit of the Hamilton Group(Dh), lying beneath the Mahantango Formation(Dmh) member of this group in Pennsylvania and Maryland. In New York, the Mahantango, also of Middle Devonian age, is further divided. There the Marcellus is separated from the overlying Skaneateles Formation, a more clastic and <b>fossiliferous</b> dark shale, by the thin Stafford or Mottville Limestone bed.|$|E
5|$|The Bristol and Bath Railway Path {{crosses the}} {{navigation}} {{several times before}} reaching the suburb of Newbridge {{on the outskirts of}} Bath. Here the A4 crosses close to the Newton St Loe SSSI, which is designated an SSSI because it represents the only remaining known exposure of <b>fossiliferous</b> Pleistocene gravels containing the remains of mammoths (Mammuthus) and horses (Equus) along the river, and has aided the development of a scientific understanding of the history of early glaciation in South West England. The final lock before entering Bath is Weston Lock, opened in 1727. Its construction created an island between the cut and the river weir, which became known as Dutch Island after the owner of the brass mill established on the riverside in the early 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Rosendale is {{underlain}} by a shale {{member of}} the Martinburg Formation called Martinburg shale, deposited as early as 500 million years ago; Martinburg shale also lines {{the bottom of the}} Rondout Creek as it flows through the town. A conglomerate of the Shawangunk Formation was deposited over the Martinburg layer approximately 425 million years ago. The conglomerate is in turn covered by High Falls Shale, a reddish shale formed by mud flats. Subsequent streams left a layer of gray Binnewater Sandstone above the shale. After the sandstone was deposited, the region experienced folding and faulting, and was submerged in a shallow sea. This allowed the creation of <b>fossiliferous</b> limestone roughly 390 million years ago, specifically the Rondout Formation and New Scotland Formation. The Rondout Formation's dolostone member, formed during the upper Silurian, was mined throughout the village because of its ability to form natural cement. The region experienced repeated glaciation, and large amounts of till and alluvium were deposited during the Wisconsonian glaciation.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, {{a clutch}} of seven 190-million-year-old Massospondylus eggs was found in Golden Gate Highlands National Park in South Africa by James Kitching, who {{identified}} them as most likely belonging to Massospondylus. It was nearly 30 years before extraction was started on the fossils of the 15-centimetre- (6in-) long embryos. They remain the oldest dinosaur embryos ever found. By early 2012, at least 10 egg clutches from at least four <b>fossiliferous</b> horizons had been found, with up to 34 eggs per clutch. This indicates that this nesting site {{may have been used}} repeatedly (site fidelity), by groups of animals (colonial nesting); in both cases, these represent the oldest evidence of this behaviour. Sedimentary structures indicate that the nesting area was in the vicinity of a lake. The eggshells were very thin (about 0.1 mm), allowing gas exchange even in a low oxygen and carbon dioxide rich environment, which indicates that the eggs were at least partly buried in the substrate. There are no hints that Massospondylus constructed nests; however, the arrangement of the eggs in tight rows indicates that the eggs were pushed in this position by the adults.|$|E
25|$|The Honda Group is a Konzentrat-Lagerstätte at the <b>fossiliferous</b> La Venta {{site in the}} {{department}} of Huila and eastern Tolima and hosts one of the richest formations containing Miocene fauna worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Kaibab Limestone (Permian): Grey <b>fossiliferous</b> limestone, exposed at {{the center}} of the Virgin River {{anticline}} along Horseman Park Drive and in the low hills to the south of South Bloomington Hills.|$|E
25|$|Jurassic.--The <b>fossiliferous</b> limestones of Antalo are {{generally}} horizontal, but are in places much disturbed when interstratified with trap rocks. The fossils are all characteristic Oolite forms and include species of Hemicidaris, Pholadomya, Ceromya, Trigonia and Alaria.|$|E
25|$|Although {{stingray}} {{teeth are}} rare on sea bottoms {{compared to the}} similar shark teeth, scuba divers searching for the latter do encounter the teeth of stingrays. Permineralized stingray teeth {{have been found in}} sedimentary deposits around the world, including <b>fossiliferous</b> outcrops in Morocco.|$|E
25|$|She also visited Ormara in Baluchistan (now Balochistan {{in western}} Pakistan); her {{collection}} of <b>fossiliferous</b> nodules was given to Richard Bullen Newton who described them in detail in the July 1905 edition of The Geological Magazine, with Woodward adding a further note.|$|E
25|$|Triassic.--In {{the region}} of Adigrat the {{metamorphic}} rocks are invariably overlain by white and brown sandstones, unfossiliferous, and attaining a maximum thickness of 300m. They are overlain by the <b>fossiliferous</b> limestones of the Antalo group. Around Chelga and Adigrat coal-bearing beds occur, which Blanford suggests may be {{of the same age}} as the coal-bearing strata of India. The Adigrat Sandstone possibly represents some portion of the Karoo System of South Africa.|$|E
25|$|In the Cesar-Ranchería Basin several {{important}} fossils have been found, {{most notably in}} the Cerrejón Formation, together with the Lagerstãtte of the Honda Group at La Venta and the Paja Formation around Villa de Leyva, the most important <b>fossiliferous</b> stratigraphic unit of Colombia. The fossil flora and gigantic reptiles of the Cerrejón Formation provided abundant data on the paleo-ecology and climate of this first Neotropic environment of the Middle Paleocene.|$|E
25|$|In the Cocinetas Basin, several <b>fossiliferous</b> stratigraphic {{units have}} been registered, {{providing}} {{an abundance of}} marine and continental vertebrate and invertebrate fossil fauna assemblages. The Uitpa, Jimol, Castilletes and Ware Formations contain numerous fossils of Neogene and Quaternary ages, {{both before and after}} the Great American Biotic Interchange (GABI), presenting new insights in the understanding of the variation in South American fauna related to the uplift of the Panama Block and the connection of North America and South America.|$|E
25|$|The Bogotá savanna is a {{slightly}} undulated montane savanna {{in the southwestern}} part of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, a high plateau in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes. The Altiplano was formed during the latest stage of Andean uplift in the Plio-Pleistocene, exposing rocks of mainly Cretaceous to Paleogene ages at surface. A small massif of Paleozoic age {{is present in the}} northern part of the Altiplano; the Floresta Massif around Floresta comprising the <b>fossiliferous</b> formations Floresta and Cuche.|$|E
25|$|Palynomorphs form a {{geological}} {{record of}} importance {{in determining the}} type of prehistoric life that existed {{at the time the}} sedimentary formation was laid down. As a result, these microfossils give important clues to the prevailing climatic conditions of the time. Their paleontological utility derives from an abundance numbering in millions of cells per gram in organic marine deposits, even when such deposits are generally not <b>fossiliferous.</b> Palynomorphs, however, generally have been destroyed in metamorphic or recrystallized rocks.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} many {{small and large}} <b>fossiliferous</b> {{limestone}} quarries {{are present in the}} area and have led to the destruction of much of the old estate features. Trearne House and the ancient Saint Bridget's chapel and well suffered the same fate. The flooded quarry close to the old castle is now in use by the Hessilhead Wildlife Rescue Centre for the recuperation of swans and other waterfowl. Limekilns were present in the woods below Over Hessilhead Farm and near Broadstone Hall. A 'lime works' is shown on the 1827 map of the parish.|$|E
25|$|Sedimentation in {{the basin}} started during the Middle to Late Eocene with the Macarao Formation and {{continued}} again during the Late Oligocene, when the Siamaná Formation, a sequence of conglomerates and thick carbonates, was deposited. Overlying the Siamaná Formation is the Early Miocene Uitpa Formation, a thick sequence of calcareous mudstone interbedded with lithic sandstones. The Uitpa Formation is covererd by the Miocene Jimol and Castilletes Formations, composed mostly of lithic sandstones and mudstones, that are in certain areas highly <b>fossiliferous.</b> The last phase of preserved sedimentation {{is represented by the}} Pliocene Ware Formation, defined in 2015 by Moreno et al.|$|E
25|$|During the Mesozoic, {{the central}} part of Colombia was a rift basin {{to the west of the}} Guyana Shield, where series of marine {{platform}} deposits were deposited. The proto-Caribbean, the result of the break-up of Pangea, formed a long seaway into the South American Plate, up to Bolivia. During the Late Cretaceous, the Western and Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes began rising, while the Eastern Ranges was still absent. The main phase of tectonic uplift of the Eastern Ranges commenced in the Middle Miocene, marked by a change in paleocurrents of the fluvial deposits of the Honda Group, the most <b>fossiliferous</b> stratigraphic unit of Colombia.|$|E
25|$|The {{sedimentary}} sequence {{drilled in}} the basin starts with the La Quinta Formation, that is found in a widespread area across northern Colombia and Venezuela. The formation of sandstones, basalts, conglomerates and volcanic ash was deposited in a lacustrine depositional environment in a rift basin setting related to the break-up of Pangea and has been dated to the Late Jurassic and earliest Cretaceous, 160 to 140 Ma. The formation is time-equivalent with the Girón Formation of the Eastern Ranges. The Early Cretaceous Río Negro Formation, a unit composed of sandstones, conglomerates and siltstones, is very variable in thickness {{in the basin}} and associated with continental sedimentation on rift shoulders to a post-rift setting. The formation is time-equivalent with the Tibasosa Formation of the Eastern Ranges and the Tambor Formation of the Middle Magdalena Valley. The <b>fossiliferous</b> limestones and shales of the Lagunitas Formation, lower member of the Cogollo Group, contain beds of dolomite and are indicative of a shallow, saline environment. The formation is correlated with the Rosablanca Formation of the Middle Magdalena Valley and western Eastern Ranges and the Tibú Formation of the Maracaibo Basin. The unit is the deepest source rock for the oils in the Cesar-Ranchería Basin. The upper member of the Cogollo Group, the Aguas Blancas Formation, presents a large lateral variability in lithologies. Black biomicrites and <b>fossiliferous</b> limestones are indicative of a middle to outer platform environment, while sandy shales and glauconitic sandstones indicate a shallow marine environment. The variation in lithologies and organic content of this source rock formation is associated with basinal relative sea level changes and the organic-rich strata to the Aptian anoxic event, dated to approximately 120 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|The Cesar-Ranchería Basin is {{underlain}} by Neoproterozoic basement. The Sierra Nevada Metamorphic Belt {{was formed}} during the Grenville orogeny, when the supercontinent Rodinia was formed {{due to the}} collision of Amazonia, Baltica and Laurentia. The granulites and gneisses of the complex have been dated to 1.5 to 1.0 Ga. The phyllites and quartzites of the Perijá Formation were formed during the Early Paleozoic and {{are related to the}} Caledonian orogeny. The shales of the Río Cachirí Group were deposited in the Devonian and contain abundant fossils of brachiopods, bryozoa, corals and crinoids. The formation is time-equivalent with the <b>fossiliferous</b> Floresta and Cuche Formations of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense. The sediments were deposited in an epicontinental sea {{at the edge of the}} Paleo-Tethys Ocean, the last remnant of the Rheic Ocean.|$|E
25|$|The Honda Group is {{the richest}} <b>fossiliferous</b> stratigraphic unit of Colombia, {{and one of}} the most {{important}} for the Miocene worldwide. At the La Venta site, numerous fossils of various orders have been and are found still. The site marks a unique ecosystem showing a broad range of biodiversity. La Venta is also an important site as it represents the youngest uniquely South American faunal assemblage before the Great American Biotic Interchange; the result of the uplift of the Isthmus of Panama, of which the initial phase has been dated at around 12 Ma. This led to a drastic alteration of the South American former island continental fauna. The Sparassodonta formed the dominant carnivorous mammal group in South America during most of the Cenozoic. In South America, the carnivorous adaptive zone in terrestrial ecosystems was shared with other mammals, terror birds (Phorusrhacoidea), large crocodiles (Sebecidae), large snakes (Madsoiidae and Boidae), and even occasionally frogs. The diversity of fossil freshwater fishes and crocodilians at La Venta is the richest assemblage of South America. Fossilised trunks of Goupioxylon sp. have been identified in the Honda Group.|$|E
500|$|The browns of {{the rocks}} and trees echo those of the robes of the saints. The broad sweep of the {{mountains}} and city isolates the figures against the grandeur of nature and bustling human life. [...] Behind the figures a panoramic mountain landscape soars to the sky; [...] the mid-ground contains a variety of rocks and spikes, including strata of <b>fossiliferous</b> layers. As with the New York Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych, the mountains are capped with snow, which van Eyck may have seen during his visits to Italy and Spain, where he crossed the Alps and Pyrenees.|$|E
500|$|The Kellaways– West Tytherton Site of Special Scientific Interest, [...] north east of Chippenham, is of {{geological}} {{interest as}} the river bank exposes Callovian highly-fossiliferous sandstone which contains well-preserved bivalves, gastropods, brachiopods, belemnites and ammonites. Further downstream at Newton St Loe the Newton St Loe SSSI is another Geological Conservation Review SSSI. It represents {{the only remaining}} known exposure of <b>fossiliferous</b> Pleistocene gravels along the River Avon. In conjunction with other sites within the wider area, it has aided {{the development of a}} scientific understanding of the history of early glaciation within South West England. The bodies of mammoths (Mammuthus) and horses (Equus) have been found at the site.|$|E
500|$|Five {{geologic}} formations make up {{the southern}} portion of Florida: the Tamiami Formation, Caloosahatchee Formation, Anastasia Formation, Miami Limestone (or Miami Oolite), and the Fort Thompson Formation. The Tamiami Formation is a compression of highly permeable light colored <b>fossiliferous</b> sands and pockets of quartz, [...] thick. It is named for the Tamiami Trail that follows the upper bedrock of the Big Cypress Swamp, and underlies the southern portion of the Everglades. Between the Tamiami Formation and Lake Okeechobee is the Caloosahatchee Formation, named for the river over it. Much less permeable, this formation is highly calcitic and is composed of sandy shell marl, clay, and sand. Water underneath the Caloosahatchee Formation is typically very mineralized. Both the Tamiami and Caloosahatchee Formations developed during the Pliocene Epoch.|$|E
500|$|Stratigraphically, the Marcellus is {{the lowest}} unit of the Devonian age Hamilton Group, and is divided into several sub-units. Although black shale is the {{dominant}} lithology, it also contains lighter shales and interbedded limestone layers due to sea level variation during its deposition almost [...] The black shale was deposited in relatively deep water devoid of oxygen, and is only sparsely <b>fossiliferous.</b> Most fossils are contained in the limestone members, and the fossil record in these layers provides important paleontological insights on faunal turnovers. The black shales also contain iron ore {{that was used in}} the early economic development of the region, and uranium and pyrite which are environmental hazards. The fissile shales are also easily eroded, presenting additional civil and environmental engineering challenges.|$|E
500|$|Macabeemyrma ovata {{is known}} {{only from a}} single fossil specimen: a mostly {{complete}} adult queen, preserved as a compression fossil in fine-grained shale. The shale is from <b>fossiliferous</b> outcrops at the McAbee Fossil Beds, part of an unnamed formation in the Kamloops group which outcrops east of Cache Creek in British Columbia, Canada. The holotype specimen was collected by an unknown person and donated to Thompson Rivers University in 2002. The specimen was described by Bruce Archibald, Stefan Cover and Corrie Moreau of Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology, with their 2006 type description of the genus and species. The generic name Macabeemyrma is a [...] of the type locality at McAbee combined with the Greek , meaning [...] "ant". The specific epithet ovata, from the Latin [...] "ovatus" [...] meaning [...] "egg shaped", refers {{to the shape of}} the head capsule.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} Cretaceous Period, the Mancos Shale was {{deposited}} {{on top of}} the Dakota Sandstone, which is the rock formation that can be found under much of Colorado. The beds of the Mancos Shale are [...] "fine-grained sand-stones, mudstones, and shales" [...] which accumulated in the deep water of the Cretaceous Sea. It has a high clay content which causes it to expand when wet leading to sliding of the terrain. On top of this shale, there are three formations in the Mesaverde group which reflect the changes in depositional environment in the area over time. The first is the Point Lookout Sandstone, which is named for the Point Lookout feature in the park (elevation 8427 feet). This sandstone, which formed in the marine environment of shallow water when the Cretaceous sea was receding, is [...] "massive, fine-grained, cross-bedded, and very resistant", in its layers reflecting waves and currents that were present during the time of its formation. Its sediments are approximately 400 feet thick, and its upper layers feature <b>fossiliferous</b> invertebrates.|$|E
500|$|The Avon Gorge {{has been}} {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest because it supports some rare fauna and flora, including species unique to the gorge. There are a total of 24 rare plant species and two unique trees: the Bristol and Wilmotts's whitebeams. Other notable plants include Bristol Rock-cress, Bristol onion, Spiked Speedwell, Autumn Squill and Honewort. Other areas along the river which have this designation include Bickley Wood, Cleeve Wood, Hanham for its large population of Bath Asparagus (Ornithogalum pyrenaicum). Stidham Farm near Keynsham contains at least At least [...] of Pleistocene terrace-gravels, consisting of limestone clasts mainly, but also with Millstone Grit, Pennant Sandstone, flint and chert clasts. The site is of considerable importance for studies relating to the possible glaciation of the area, and of the terrace stratigraphy, particularly as {{it is one of}} only two accessible terrace deposits {{in this part of the}} Avon valley. Newton St Loe SSSI is also listed for geological reasons as it represents the only remaining known exposure of <b>fossiliferous</b> Pleistocene gravels along the River Avon. In conjunction with other sites within the wider area, they have aided the development of a scientific understanding of the history of early glaciation within South West England.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{its ability}} to {{dissolve}} (most) oxides and silicates, hydrofluoric acid is useful for dissolving rock samples (usually powdered) prior to analysis. In similar manner, this acid is used in acid macerations to extract organic fossils from silicate rocks. [...] <b>Fossiliferous</b> rock may be immersed directly into the acid, or a cellulose nitrate film may be applied (dissolved in amyl acetate), which adheres to the organic component and allows the rock to be dissolved around it.|$|E
2500|$|A natural rock {{structure}} near Dogubayazit, Turkey, {{has been}} misidentified as Noah's Ark. Microscopic studies of a supposed iron bracket {{show that it}} is derived from weathered volcanic minerals. Supposed metal-braced walls are natural concentrations of limonite and magnetite in steeply inclined sedimentary layers in the limbs of a doubly plunging syncline. Supposed fossilized gopherwood bark is crinkled metamorphosed peridotite. <b>Fossiliferous</b> limestone, interpreted as cross cutting the syncline, preclude the structure from being Noah's Ark because these supposed [...] "Flood" [...] deposits are younger than the [...] "Ark." [...] Anchor stones at Kazan (Arzap) are derived from local andesite and not from Mesopotamia.|$|E
2500|$|When Darwin wrote On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life, {{the oldest}} animal fossils were {{those from the}} Cambrian Period, now known to be about 540million years old. He worried about the absence of older fossils because of the {{implications}} on the validity of his theories, but he expressed hope that such fossils would be found, noting that: [...] "only {{a small portion of}} the world is known with accuracy." [...] Darwin also pondered the sudden appearance of many groups (i.e. phyla) in the oldest known Cambrian <b>fossiliferous</b> strata.|$|E
2500|$|While true marble is metamorphic, Tennessee marble is sedimentary, and is {{therefore}} classified as limestone. [...] Tennessee marble was formed from the accumulation of bryozoan and other primordial marine lifeforms 460 million years ago, during the Ordovician period. [...] Even when polished, Tennessee marble retains a <b>fossiliferous</b> texture, with bryozoan and crinoid fossils being among the most commonly found. [...] A noticeable feature of Tennessee marble {{is the presence of}} jagged horizontal gray or black lines, or [...] "stylolites." [...] Known as [...] "crowfeet" [...] by quarrymen, these form from residual insoluble materials left over from the natural limestone dissolution processes.|$|E
2500|$|These {{outcrops}} {{are composed}} of basalt flows of 4 million years, {{although there have been}} discoveries of calcareous <b>fossiliferous</b> sediments of 4-6 million years. [...] The bank extends for [...] from northwest to southeast and is [...] wide. [...] Additionally, due to strong currents and frequent large swells the linear rock outcroppings lack any terrestrial flora or fauna. Along their perimeter, the seabed drops steeply to a depth of on either side, and gently at the northern and southern tips. The area of the Bank referred to as the Dollabarats reef, is an area of shallower gradient situated [...] along the southwest of the Formigas Islets.|$|E
2500|$|The Helderberg Plateau {{comprises}} {{a series}} of limestones of early Devonian age {{and is one of}} the most <b>fossiliferous</b> regions in the United States. [...] The park is a window in to New York's geological history, as the rocks here take us back in time hundreds of millions of years. In the 1800's, some of the world's most renowned pioneering geologists, such as Charles Lyell and Amos Eaton, visited this location due to its robust fossil assemblage. During this time James Hall (paleontologist), New York's first state paleontologist, frequently visited the Heldeberg Escarpment, making observations and documenting the unique fossil assemblage. [...] In the 1930's, Winifred Goldring, New York's state paleontologist and the first female state paleontologist in the nation, continued the work of pioneering geologists and in 1933 wrote a guide to Thacher State Park that is still in use to this day.|$|E
