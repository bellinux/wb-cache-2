50|$|The {{spore print}} {{is not always}} successful, as some {{mushrooms}} are too young or old to produce spores. Mushrooms collected at high elevations will typically not produce a spore print at lower elevations. Sometimes, the color can {{vary depending on the}} thickness of the spore print. In the genus Lactarius, thin deposits are usually white, while thick deposits are cream to yellow. Many of the original authors of species in this genus did not indicate whether spore print colors they recorded were with thick or thin prints, limiting the usefulness of this feature as an <b>identification</b> <b>characteristic.</b> In some instances, the color of the spore print matches that of the mature gills, but this is not always true and gill color cannot reliably be used as an indicator of spore print color.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new technique}} for directly designing a linear digital controller for a single-phase pulse width modulation (PWM) converter systems, based on closed-loop identification. The design procedure consists of three steps. First, obtain a digital current controller for the inner loop system by using the error space approach, so that the power factor of the supply is close to one. The outer loop is composed of a voltage controller, a current control loop including a current controller, a PWM converter, and a capacitor. Then, all the components, except the voltage controller, are identified by a discrete-time equivalent linear model, using the closed-loop output error (CLOE) method. Based on this equivalent model, a proper digital voltage controller is then directly designed. It is shown through PSim simulations and experimental results that the proposed method is useful for the practical design of PWM converter controllers.

Mature trees can have spiny branches with bark that is rough and quite dark, almost black in some cases.
