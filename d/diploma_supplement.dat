25|$|This {{reform was}} {{elaborated}} {{in order to}} attain an education system based {{on the development of}} competences rather than on the transmission of knowledge, and included the development of a system of easily readable and comparable degrees aimed to simplify comparison between qualifications across Europe. The flexibility and transparency enabled students to have their qualifications recognised more widely, facilitating freedom of movement around a more transparent EHEA (European Higher Education Area). This was aided by the establishment of a system of credits {{in the form of the}} European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) and the adoption of the <b>Diploma</b> <b>Supplement</b> by all countries involved. One academic year corresponds to 60 ECTS-credits that are equivalent to 1500–1800 hours of study. The new model comes closer to the North American and Japanese systems. It gives greater weight to practical training, intensive research projects and the way credits are measured reflects how hard a student has worked. The new evaluation methods reflect not only a student's performance on exams, but also his or her lab experiments, presentations, hours spent on study, innovation capacities and so forth.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} for countries and educational institutions located outside of the European Higher Education Area to realize that Diploma Supplements cannot be retroactively issued, hence why students who graduated before their institution's country became signatory to the Bologna Convention cannot possibly have a <b>diploma</b> <b>supplement</b> for that degree. Consequently, requesting a <b>Diploma</b> <b>Supplement</b> from a student who graduated from a European university in 1995 or earlier is nonsensical since the Bologna Process was not even in place before that date.|$|E

The CORINTHIAM project has benefitted member institutions by facilitating the open access to information and knowledge about EHEA, a deeper appreciation for quality of services delivered by the departments of International Relations, and the training of specialists in EHEA and Bologna issues. These handbooks may be considered as a reflection of the sustainable structure that has been obtained through the outcomes of the above mentioned project. Each of the sections focuses on a distinctive pillar of the project: management of international relations, management of international projects, Internationalization at Home, quality of internationalisation and learning experiences of piloting ECTS at third-country in-stitutions.

40|$|Purpose – This study extends {{coverage}} of the accounting literature to means of measuring, recording and reporting university-student learning. The means in question comprise credit, credit points, levels of learning, level descriptors, learning outcomes, and related characteristics of course catalogues, qualification frameworks, credit transfer systems and student records, transcripts and <b>diploma</b> <b>supplements.</b> Despite the infant precursors of these calculative practices, processes, records and so on having been labelled curricular accounting (see Theodossin, E. (1986), The Modular Market, Further Education Staff College, London), accounting researchers have overlooked these means as a variant of accounting, notwithstanding that how accounting figures variously in New Higher Education {{has been the subject}} of widespread accounting research studies. Design/Methodology/Approach – The subject is addressed both in a technical way and in the broader context of accounting in organisations and society. The former University of New Zealand and its affiliate in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the successor of that affiliate, Te Whare Wananga o Waitaha /the University of Canterbury, are used as a case study for archival study and participant-observation. The credit point system in place at the University of Canterbury in 2010 and antecedent arrangements back to 1873 are analysed genealogically, using ideas of representational schemes, path-dependent changes and negotiated orders among parties who have been associated with the case institution. In the present paper, particular attention is paid to how and why curricular accounting and antecedent means of specifying, recording and controlling learning are connected with enlargement of the institution, including the learning (and teaching) provided. Findings – The retrospective analysis illuminates how and why growth in students, staff, qualifications, courses, subjects and so on shaped and formed curricular accounting, and came to be enabled and further fuelled by curricular accounting; and suggests that similar applies across tertiary education in many countries...|$|R

40|$|Performance Management Conference Book of Abstracts: Conference 2009 Theory and Practice in Performance ManagementPurpose – Accounting {{has been}} shown to figure {{variously}} in New Higher Education. However, despite their infant precursors having been labelled curricular accounting (Theodossin, 1986), accounting researchers have overlooked a collection of calculative practices that has grown and spread internationally over the past two decades. The collection in question comprises credit points, levels of learning, level descriptors, learning outcomes, and related characteristics of student transcripts and <b>diploma</b> <b>supplements,</b> qualification frameworks and credit transfer systems. This paper extends coverage of the accounting literature to this particular variant of accounting. Design/Methodology/Approach – The subject is addressed both in a technical way and in the broader context of accounting in organisations and society. The former University of New Zealand and its affiliate in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the University of Canterbury, also of that city, are used as a case study. The credit point system in place at the University of Canterbury in 2009 and its antecedents back to 1873 are analysed genealogically. Participantobservation and related means are used to collect data. These data are analysed using ideas of representational schemes, path-dependent changes and negotiated orders among parties who have been associated with the case institutions. Findings – The analysis illuminates how and why learning (and teaching) at the University of Canterbury has come to be specified, recorded and controlled using curricular accounting; and why the accounting in use accords conceptually and, to an increasing degree, in practice to that in use across tertiary education in many countries. Among the social, economic and political issues that have spurred on this spread are international standards, quality and equivalence of tertiary education qualifications, study and learning; diversification of participation in tertiary education; changes to the levels and sources of funding tertiary education; and the many and varied ideas, etc. associated with New Higher Education. The spread has multifarious consequences for students, academics, alumni, universities and similar institutions, higher education, governments and others.
