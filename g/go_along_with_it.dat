5|$|Long ago, King Childeric I came to {{the forest}} to build a city while the Queen experimented with black magic to gain eternal life. A plague swept through the land, and she hid in her tower, while her husband and {{everyone}} below her perished. Her spell granted her immortal life, but not the youth and beauty to <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Her youthful appearance now only exists in her mirror, the source of her life, as an illusion and nothing more.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{introduces}} his illegitimate son, Donald (Michael Benjamin Washington), to the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff. Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{suspect that}} Donald is embezzling from Tracy {{as they do}} not believe that Donald is twenty-one years old, which Donald claims to be. Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden), Liz's assistant, obtains Donald's birth certificate and gives it to Liz and Pete; the two learn that Donald is forty years of age, thus confirming their suspicions about him. Liz tells Tracy about this, but Tracy knew all about Donald's scam, explaining he decided to <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> because Donald was putting all of the money into a dojo and doing good for the community.|$|E
5|$|The Saint Paul City Council {{decided in}} late 1974 to support I-35E, {{possibly}} {{due to the}} influence of proponents. R.I.P. 35E proposed an alternative to the original plan, and convinced the city council to <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> The plan included a four-lane boulevard upgrade of Pleasant Avenue (the street chosen for the I-35E alignment), with another route such as Shepard Road or the nearby Lafayette Freeway forming part of I-35E. The group opposed any direct connection of this parkway to I-94 near the State Capitol, where I-35E and I-94 were to merge. The EIS was completed in early 1975, identifying noise pollution, air pollution, vibrations, and slope stability as the main concerns. In addition to the nearby location of historic districts, hospitals were worried about the effects of vibrations on sensitive operations; the MHD solved this problem while the report was being developed. The EIS identified the primary benefit of completing I-35E as connecting downtown Saint Paul to the Interstate Highway System, and determined that the original Pleasant Avenue corridor was the best choice, but with minor changes such as lowering the freeway below Grand Avenue and Ramsey Street.|$|E

25|$|De Gaulle also tried, {{largely in}} vain, {{to attract the}} support of French forces in the French Empire. He telegraphed to General Charles Noguès (Resident-General in Morocco and Commander-in-Chief of French forces in North Africa), {{offering}} to serve under him or to cooperate in any way. Noguès, who was dismayed by the armistice but agreed to <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> refused to cooperate and forbade the press in French North Africa to publish de Gaulle’s appeal. Noguès told the British liaison officer that de Gaulle’s attitude was “unseemly”. De Gaulle also sent a telegram to Weygand offering to serve under his orders, receiving a dismissive reply.|$|E
25|$|The Astros {{had many}} highlights. After the Astrodome hosted the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in July, the Astros {{went on a}} streak with five {{straight}} come-from-behind wins (two against the Mets and three against the Montreal Expos). In {{a game against the}} Dodgers, pitcher Jim Deshaies (who came from the Yankees in exchange for Joe Niekro) started the game with eight straight strikeouts. On September 25, Mike Scott helped his team clinch the NL West by no-hitting the San Francisco Giants. This was the only time in MLB history that any division was clinched via a no-hitter.

25|$|The more {{moderate}} {{members of the}} Volunteers' Provisional Committee {{did not like the}} idea, nor the way it was presented, but they were largely prepared to <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> to prevent Redmond from forming a rival organisation, which would draw away most of their support. The IRB was completely opposed to Redmond's demands, as this would end any chance they had of controlling the Volunteers. Hobson, who simultaneously served in leadership roles in both the IRB and the Volunteers, was one of a few IRB members to reluctantly submit to Redmond's demands, leading to a falling out with the IRB leaders, notably Tom Clarke. In the end the Committee accepted Redmond's demands, by a vote of 18 to 9, most of the votes of dissent coming from members of the IRB.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} Piłsudski's plan was {{strongly}} criticized, {{and only the}} desperate situation of the Polish forces persuaded other commanders to <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Though based on reliable intelligence, including decrypted Soviet radio communications, the plan was termed [...] "amateurish" [...] by high-ranking army officers and military experts who were {{quick to point out}} Piłsudski's lack of formal military education. When a copy of the plan fell into Soviet hands, Western Front commander Mikhail Tukhachevsky thought it a ruse and disregarded it. Days later, the Soviets paid dearly for this when, during the Battle of Warsaw, the overconfident Red Army suffered one of its greatest defeats ever.|$|E
5000|$|Rusk then {{approved}} the message. In the 1980s, Rusk said [...] "If Ball, Harriman, and President Kennedy {{were going to}} send it out, I wasn't going to raise any questions." [...] Forrestal then phoned Gilpatric’s farm {{in the evening and}} told him that both Kennedy and Rusk had already approved. Gilpatric later recalled that [...] "If Rusk <b>went</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> and the President <b>went</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> I wasn't going to oppose it." [...] He washed his hands of the matter, saying that it was between Kennedy and the state department, saying that [...] "In McNamara's absence I felt I should not hold it up, so I <b>went</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> just like you countersign a voucher." [...] Marine General Victor Krulak also signed off without showing his superior, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Maxwell Taylor. Richard Helms of the CIA also endorsed the message without notifying the director John McCone; he later said that he believed that Forrestal was only advising of a resolution that had already been made. Forrestal then told Kennedy that he had gained the support of Kennedy’s inner circle, so the president told him to send the message. Cable 243 was thus sent to Lodge at 21:36.|$|R

[...] Sondheim {{acknowledged}} that, in adapting a musical to film, the plot has to be kept moving, and was sent MP3 files of his shortened songs by Mike Higham, the film's music producer, for approval. Several other songs were also cut, and Sondheim noted that there were [...] "many changes, additions and deletions..... if you just <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> I think you'll have a spectacular time." [...] To create a larger, more cinematic feel, the score was re-orchestrated by the stage musical's original orchestrator, Jonathan Tunick, who increased the orchestra from 27 musicians to 78.|$|E
500|$|Assessments vary as {{to whether}} Anderson was a {{deliberate}} impostor, delusional, traumatized into adopting a new identity, or someone used by her supporters for their own ends. Pierre Gilliard denounced Anderson as [...] "a cunning psychopath". The equation of Anderson {{with members of the}} imperial family began with Clara Peuthert in the Dalldorf Asylum, rather than with Anderson herself. Anderson appeared to <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> afterwards. Writer Michael Thornton thought, [...] "Somewhere along the way she lost and rejected Schanzkowska. She lost that person totally and accepted completely she was this new person. I think it happened by accident and she was swept along on a wave of euphoria." [...] Lord Mountbatten, a first cousin of the Romanov children, thought her supporters [...] "simply get rich on the royalties of further books, magazine articles, plays etc." [...] Prince Michael Romanov, a grandson of Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, stated the Romanov family always knew Anderson was a fraud, and that the family looked upon her and [...] "the three-ringed circus which danced around her, creating books and movies, as a vulgar insult to the memory of the Imperial Family." ...|$|E

She asks him to <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> so that he can keep his job. Jack gets on board and informs his guest, actor George Takei, that the network asked that he not reveal he is gay on the show.

Ross initially saw the character as easy to play, calling her [...] "everyone's best friend, and the town doctor, and a great mother". The actress had a more difficult time when Eve began behaving in morally questionable ways to protect secrets about her past.

When asked to describe Eve in three words, Ross responded {{that she was a}} [...] "contradiction inside an enigma".

Ross appreciated Eve's characterization as a human being who was not portrayed as completely good or bad and had admirable qualities as well as faults. She later connected Eve's shame of her past life with Julian and inability to tell her family to Lavinia Kingsley's regrets about her youth in the 2002 comedy film The Banger Sisters.|$|E
