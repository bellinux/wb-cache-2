5|$|The female {{develops}} a brood patch of bare skin and plays {{the main part}} in <b>incubating</b> the eggs. The male helps, but can only cover the eggs rather than truly incubate them. The female spends the night <b>incubating</b> during this period, while the male roosts near the nest. Eggs hatch at the same time, after a short incubation period lasting 11–14days, and exceptionally {{for as many as}} 17 or as few as 9. The length of the incubation period decreases as ambient temperature increases later in the breeding season.|$|E

5|$|After <b>incubating</b> {{for around}} 80 days, {{hatchlings}} dig through the sand to the surface, usually at night, when darkness increases {{the chance of}} escaping predation and damage from extreme sand surface temperatures is reduced.

40|$|The {{growth of}} uninjured and heat-injured Aeromonas hydrophila <b>incubated</b> at 5 degrees C (22 days) and 30 degrees C (31 h) under air, N 2, and CO 2 was investigated. At 30 degrees C, the growth {{patterns}} of cells on {{brain heart infusion}} agar <b>incubated</b> under air and N 2 were similar, although slight differences in the lengths of the lag phases and the final populations were detected. The lag phases of cells <b>incubated</b> under air and N 2 were substantially longer at 5 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. The population of uninjured A. hydrophila <b>incubated</b> at 5 degrees C under air and N 2 remained constant, whereas the number of injured cells declined before the exponential growth phase. Growth at 5 degrees C was enhanced when uninjured and heat-injured A. hydrophila were <b>incubated</b> under N 2.

5|$|Male blackcaps will {{sometimes}} sing even when <b>incubating,</b> {{especially with the}} second brood. This appears to be intended to maintain the bond with the female. Wintering birds in Africa are quiet initially, but start singing in January or February prior to their return north.|$|E
5|$|The striped honeyeater breeds {{throughout}} its distribution range, usually as simple pairs, with both sexes building the nest, <b>incubating</b> and feeding the young.

30|$|However, {{ultrasound}} irradiation {{resulted in}} a marked increase in DOX uptake in MCF- 7 cells <b>incubated</b> with DOX-NBs; DOX-NBs could deliver more DOX into MCF- 7 cells {{with the help of}} ultrasonic irradiation. In contrast, the DOX uptake in MCF- 7 cells <b>incubated</b> with free DOX was only slightly increased under ultrasonic irradiation. The results suggested that the uptake of DOX in MCF- 7 cells <b>incubated</b> with DOX-NBs was much higher than that of the cells <b>incubated</b> with free DOX under ultrasonic irradiation.|$|R
5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When <b>incubating</b> a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E
5|$|A small species, the Inaccessible Island rail has brown plumage {{and a black}} {{bill and}} feet. It {{occupies}} most habitats on Inaccessible Island, from the beaches to the central plateau, feeding {{on a variety of}} small invertebrates and also some plant matter. Pairs are territorial and monogamous, with both parents being responsible for <b>incubating</b> the eggs and raising the chicks. Its adaptations to living on a tiny island at high densities include low base metabolic rates, small clutch sizes, and flightlessness.|$|E
5|$|Adult common loons {{have few}} predators, {{although}} bald eagles will attack <b>incubating</b> birds. Attacks by sharks in winter {{have also been}} recorded. When a predator approaches (either the loon's nest or the loon itself), the common loon sometimes attacks the predator by rushing at it and trying to stab it with its dagger-like bill, aiming its attacks either at the predator's abdomen or the back of its head or neck.|$|E
30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the stability of}} the active GadB in broth at 50  °C, the sample was <b>incubated</b> at 50  °C for 36  h and GadB activity was measured at different time points, using the sample <b>incubated</b> at 37  °C as control. As shown in Fig.  4 b, GadB activity decreased with time and at all time points, residual GadB activity in the sample <b>incubated</b> at 50  °C was less than the sample <b>incubated</b> at 37  °C. After 6  h incubation, 29.5 and 16.9  % residual GadB activity were remained for samples <b>incubated</b> at 37 and 50  °C, respectively; after 36  h incubation, only 17.3 and 5.9  % residual GadB activity were remained for samples <b>incubated</b> at 37 and 50  °C, respectively. This indicated that extracellular GadB in BL 21 (DE 3)/pET 20 b-torA-gadB was more stable at 37  °C than at 50  °C.|$|R

5|$|Adult mockingbirds {{can fall}} victim to birds of prey such as the great horned owl, screech owl and sharp-shinned hawk, though their {{tenacious}} behavior makes them less likely to being captured. Scrub-jays also have killed and eaten mockingbirds. Snakes rarely capture <b>incubating</b> females. Fledgelings have been prey to domestic cats, red-tailed hawks, and crows. Eggs and nestlings are consumed by blue jays, fish crows and American crows, red-tailed hawks, swallow-tailed kites, snakes, squirrels, and cats. Blowfly larvae and Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} Florida and Arizona populations, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds {{are common}} {{components}} of the avifauna of {{some parts of the}} Neotropics and are thought to be important in some ecological processes. They are preyed upon by birds of prey, and their tendency to join flocks is thought to provide protection against such predation. The greater round-eared bat preys on some antbird species, such as the white-bibbed antbird and the scaled antbird; the latter is the bat's preferred prey. Nests, including <b>incubating</b> adults, chicks and eggs, are vulnerable to predators, particularly snakes but also nocturnal mammals. Nesting success is low for many species, particularly in areas of fragmented habitat.|$|E
5|$|Incubation takes 56days, and {{the male}} stops <b>incubating</b> the eggs shortly before they hatch. The {{temperature}} of the nest rises slightly during the eight-week period. Although the eggs are laid sequentially, they tend to hatch within two days of one another, as the eggs that were laid later experienced higher temperatures and developed more rapidly. During the process, the precocial emu chicks {{need to develop a}} capacity for thermoregulation. During incubation, the embryos are kept at a constant temperature but the chicks will {{need to be able to}} cope with varying external temperatures by the time they hatch.|$|E

We find that launching underperforming <b>incubated</b> mutual funds is associated with objectives that are attracting large inflows and lower relative risk. These findings are consistent with the use of incubation to maximize fee revenue through means other than the flow-to-performance relationship. We also find that underperforming <b>incubated</b> funds are <b>incubated</b> longer, suggesting that families release funds opportunistically to take advantage of outperformance when it is observed...|$|R

5|$|Males {{make two}} calls that are {{directed}} at females, sometimes {{as a prelude}} to mating. One is a sequence of short squeaks; the other is made up of consecutive ah notes with 0.1 second between each note. These calls can be brief or last up to several minutes. Nestlings make a noisy grating begging call when seeking or expecting food. An adult female may also make the call while <b>incubating</b> the eggs. Immature birds also make a grating call not associated with begging that parents ignore.|$|E
5|$|The binding and {{inactivation}} {{steps of}} this reaction are investigated by <b>incubating</b> the enzyme with inhibitor and assaying {{the amount of}} activity remaining over time. The activity will be decreased in a time-dependent manner, usually following exponential decay. Fitting these data to a rate equation gives the rate of inactivation at this concentration of inhibitor. This is done at several different concentrations of inhibitor. If a reversible EI complex is involved the inactivation rate will be saturable and fitting this curve will give kinact and Ki.|$|E
5|$|The fate of {{the first}} egg is mostly unknown, but studies on the related royal penguin and erect-crested penguin show the female tips the egg out when the larger second egg is laid. The task of <b>incubating</b> the egg {{is divided into three}} roughly equal {{sessions}} of around 12days each over a five-week period. The first session is shared by both parents, followed by the male returning to sea, leaving the female alone to tend the egg. Upon the male's return, the female goes off to sea and does not return until the chick has hatched. Both sexes fast for a considerable period during breeding; the male fasts for 37days after arrival until he returns to sea for around 10 days before fasting while <b>incubating</b> eggs and young for another 36days, and the female fasts for 42days from her arrival after the male until late in the incubation period. Both adults lose 36–40% of their body weight during this period. The second egg hatches around 34days after it is laid. Macaroni penguins typically leave their breeding colony by April or May to disperse into the ocean.|$|E

40|$|Leaf litter {{decomposes}} on {{the surface}} of soil in natural systems and element transfers between litter and soil are commonly found. However, how litter and soil organic matter (SOM) interact to influence decomposition rate and nitrogen (N) release remains unclear. Leaf litter and mineral soil of top 0 - 5 cm from six forests were <b>incubated</b> separately, or together with litter on soil surface at 25 A degrees C for 346 days. Litter N remaining and soil respiration rate were repeatedly measured during incubation. Litter carbon (C) and mass losses and mineral N concentrations in litter and soil were measured at the end of incubation. Net N transfer from soil to litter was found in all litters when <b>incubated</b> with soil. Litter <b>incubated</b> with soil lost more C than litter <b>incubated</b> alone after 346 days. For litters with initial C: N ratios lower than 52, net N-min after 346 days was 100 % higher when <b>incubated</b> with soil than when <b>incubated</b> alone. Litter net N-min rate was negatively related to initial C: N ratio when <b>incubated</b> with soil but not when <b>incubated</b> alone. Soil respiration rate and net N-min rate did not differ between soil <b>incubated</b> with litter and soil <b>incubated</b> alone. We conclude that soils may enhance litter decomposition rate by net N transfer from soil to litter. Our results together with studies on litter mixture decomposition suggest that net N transfer between decomposing organic matter with different N status may be common and may significantly influence decomposition and N release. The low net N-min rate during litter decomposition along with the small size of litter N pool compared to soil N pool suggest that SOM rather than decomposing litter is the major contributor to plant mineral N supply...|$|R

5|$|Clutches contain {{between two}} and six eggs, {{typically}} three or four. Variation in clutch size depends {{on the amount of}} food available for young birds. Presumably owing to the greater availability of food, clutches are larger during the peak of the breeding season, and in more southern latitudes of the Cape sparrow's range. Both birds of a pair incubate the eggs during the day, switching every ten or fifteen minutes. At night, only the female incubates the eggs, while the male roosts outside or in the nest. In pairs breeding outside of colonies, birds leave the nest to make room for their mates upon hearing their mates approaching. Among colonial pairs, the <b>incubating</b> bird waits until its partner arrives in the nest, to prevent other birds from entering the nest. Incubation seems to begin before the clutch is complete, and lasts 12–24days.|$|E
5|$|The nesting season starts early, {{with some}} birds <b>incubating</b> eggs by early April. American crows build bulky stick nests, nearly always in trees but {{sometimes}} also in large bushes and, very rarely, on the ground. They will nest {{in a wide}} variety of trees, including large conifers, although oaks are most often used. Three to six eggs are laid and incubated for 18 days. The young are usually fledged by about 36 days after hatching. Predation primarily occurs at the nest site and eggs and nestlings are frequently eaten by snakes, raccoons, ravens and domestic cats. Adults are less frequently predated but face potential attack from great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, peregrine falcons and eagles. They may be attacked by predators such as coyotes or bobcats at carrion when incautious although this is even rarer.|$|E
5|$|The typical clutch size is two eggs, 20.3 × 15.1mm in size, {{which are}} pale blueish green with red or brown splotches that are {{concentrated}} around the wider end. Both sexes share the incubation duties, with each parent <b>incubating</b> for stints of around 25minutes before being relieved. This species is extremely territorial around the nest, chasing away other birds, including brindled white-eyes, rufous fantails, and other golden white-eyes. From laying {{it takes about}} two weeks for the eggs to hatch. The hatchlings are altricial, in other words naked and helpless. Both parents share the brooding and feeding duties, and take away faecal sacs to keep the nest clean. The diet of the chicks is almost exclusively composed of insects and caterpillars. Chicks fledge around 1014 days after hatching. After fledging they may remain with their parents in small groups for some time.|$|E

The growth of the sections of primary roots <b>incubated</b> for 2 h in the presence of 10 − 7 M IAA or higher concentrations was lower than that of the sections <b>incubated</b> in the absence of IAA. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of proteins which was increased by IAA treatment is independent of an inhibition of the growth induced by IAA in maize primary roots. The phosphorylation of proteins in sections of coleoptiles <b>incubated</b> for 10, 20 or 40 min in the presence of 10 − 7 or 10 − 5 M IAA was equal to that in the sections <b>incubated</b> in the absence of IAA.
