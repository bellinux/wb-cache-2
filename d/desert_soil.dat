500|$|Since the car chase in Las Vegas {{would have}} many car crashes, the filmmakers had an {{arrangement}} with Ford {{to use their}} vehicles. Ford's only demand was that Sean Connery had to drive the 1971 Mustang Mach 1 which serves as Tiffany Case's car. The Moon Buggy {{was inspired by the}} actual NASA vehicle, but with additions such as flailing arms since the producers didn't find the design [...] "outrageous" [...] enough. Built by custom car fabricator Dean Jeffries on a rear-engined Corvair chassis, it was capable of road speeds. The fibreglass [...] tires had to be replaced during the chase sequence because the heat and irregular <b>desert</b> <b>soil</b> ruined them.|$|E
500|$|Hemilepistus reaumuri {{can only}} escape {{the heat of}} the desert by {{constructing}} a burrow, which is time-consuming and energetically costly. One parent must therefore guard the burrow while the other forages for food. H. reaumuri can spend up to ten months of the year returning to the surface to forage, which is far longer than species which do not dig burrows, such as Armadillidium vulgare or Armadillo officinalis. Although they will forage at temperatures as high as , these woodlice retreat to their burrow when the temperature is too high. They are also unable to tolerate air with a relative humidity below 6%, which often occurs at depths of up to [...] in the <b>desert</b> <b>soil</b> in the hottest months, and the burrows are therefore dug at least [...] deep. The burrows are vertical, with a single entrance [...] in diameter, and there may be up to 20 burrows per square metre (nearly 2 per square foot) in favourable areas. If a foraging woodlouse cannot find the burrow entrance on its return, it employs a complex and efficient strategy to find it again. It begins with a spirally widening search, and develops into a more meandering approach the longer it is unable to find the burrow.|$|E

The Negev is also sub-divided into five {{different}} ecological regions: northern, western and central Negev, the high plateau and the Arabah Valley. The northern Negev receives [...] of rain annually and has fairly fertile soils. The western Negev receives [...] of rain per year, with light and partially sandy soils. The central Negev has an annual precipitation of [...] and {{is characterized by}} impervious soil, allowing minimum penetration of water with greater soil erosion and water runoff.

6000|$|Rarely has the San Saba country {{contributed to}} the spread of the fine arts. Its sons have excelled in the solider graces, in the throw of the lariat, the {{manipulation}} of the esteemed [...] .45, the intrepidity of the one-card draw, and the nocturnal stimulation of towns from undue lethargy; but, hitherto, it had not been famed as a stronghold of æsthetics. Lonny Briscoe's brush had removed that disability. Here, among the limestone rocks, the succulent cactus, and the drought-parched grass of that arid valley, had been born the Boy Artist. Why he came to woo art is beyond postulation. Beyond doubt, some spore of the afflatus must have sprung up within him in spite of the <b>desert</b> <b>soil</b> of San Saba. The tricksy spirit of creation must have incited him to attempted expression and then have sat hilarious among the white-hot sands of the valley, watching its mischievous work.

40|$|ABSTRACT] During the Gulf war seven {{hundreds}} of oil wells {{were destroyed by}} the retreating armies of Iraq. In particular, the Burgan oil field suffered heavy damage. Over 50 millions of crude oil spilled out flooding the desert and as a result, extensive contamination of <b>desert</b> <b>soils</b> occurred. Field investigations indicated that crude oil penetrated the <b>desert</b> <b>soils</b> under the newly formed oil lakes {{to a depth of}} 150 cm for the 5 years following the Gulf war. The calculated penetration of this oil into the soil over the next 100 years is determined to be approximately 10 meters. At the Burgan area groundwater was not contaminated because the upper aquifer was at a depth of more than 100 meters...|$|R

Prosopis pubescens {{found in the}} Chihuahua desert was studied as a potential for phytoremediation in <b>desert</b> <b>soils.</b> Transmission electron microscopy was used to reveal ultrastructural changes within seedlings exposed to 0 - 600 ppm copper nitrate.
