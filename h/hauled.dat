5|$|The line beyond Harrow was not {{electrified}} so trains were <b>hauled</b> by {{an electric}} locomotive from Baker Street, changed for a steam locomotive en route. From 1 January 1907, the exchange {{took place at}} Wembley Park. From 19 July 1908, locomotives were changed at Harrow. GWR rush hour services to the city continued to operate, electric traction taking over from steam at Paddington from January 1907, although freight services to Smithfield continued to be steam <b>hauled</b> throughout.|$|E
5|$|A snow groomer is {{a machine}} {{designed}} to smooth and compact the snow, rather than removing it altogether. Early snow groomers {{were used by}} residents of rural areas to compress the snow close to their homes, and consisted of a heavy roller <b>hauled</b> by oxen which compacted the snow to make a smooth surface for sledging. With {{the invention of the}} motor car, snow groomers were replaced by snowplows and snow blowers on public thoroughfares, but remained in use at ski resorts, where they are used to maintain smooth, safe trails for various wintersports, including skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling. Snow groomers remained unchanged throughout the 20th century, with most consisting of heavy roller which could be attached to a tractor or snowcat and then <b>hauled</b> across the area to be groomed.|$|E

5|$|Initially, all trains on {{the line}} were <b>hauled</b> by steam locomotives, in {{particular}} NSB Class 20 and NSB Class 21 brought in used from other lines. The first diesel multiple units were taken into use in the 1930s, with the line seeing the use of both NSB Class Cmb 16 and Kristine Valdresdatter. During World War II, the line was again entirely <b>hauled</b> by steam locomotives and the service was reduced considerably. By 1945, there were three round trips per week, but after the war ended, the frequency increased and by 1947 there were four daily round trips. Various classes of multiple units have been used, including NSB Class 86, NSB Class 87 and NSB Class 91. During the 1950s, there were sometimes also trains that operated just from Kongsberg to Veggli.|$|E

5|$|In 1876 Ferdinand de Rothschild {{began work}} on Waddesdon Manor, a short {{distance}} south of the Tramway's station at Waddesdon (later renamed Waddesdon Road). The top of Lodge Hill, a landmark, was levelled to provide a site and sloping drives were cut into the hill {{to provide access to}} the construction site. Transport of materials was by horse, but the contractors had to get enormous stone blocks up the hill. Rothschild's contractors built a line, known as the Winchendon Branch, which turned off the Tramway between Waddesdon and Westcott stations and ran south to the foot of Lodge Hill. From there a cable tram ran on narrow gauge rails up the hill to a gully close to the building site. Materials were <b>hauled</b> along the cable tramway in tubs by a steam-powered winch. The Winchendon Branch was hastily and cheaply built; after one of the Tramway's locomotives derailed there on 5 July 1876 Jones refused to allow his engines on it, and from then on materials were <b>hauled</b> along the branch by horses.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, an NSB Class Cmb1 diesel {{multiple}} unit was taken into use, {{and the number of}} daily trips increased to four. On days with heavy traffic, it <b>hauled</b> a trailer, which was normally stationed at Sandnes Station. On 10 November 1935, the new Ganddal Station opened, simplifying the stopping at the station. During World War II, the {{multiple unit}}s were disused, and instead the trains were <b>hauled</b> with steam locomotives. From 1 May 1944, the line was converted to standard gauge, and NSB Class 14 multiple units were taken into use, running on wood gas {{until the end of the}} war. In 1945, there were four daily round trips, but at the start of 1946, the number of daily round trips increased to six, and from mid-1946, to ten. From 1947 to 1953, there were eight or nine daily round trips, and from 1953 ten. Class 14 was eventually replaced with NSB Class 86 and NSB Class 87 in 1953. By then, the driving time from Ålgård to Sandnes had been reduced from 38 to 25minutes.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} on <b>hauling</b> productivities and <b>hauling</b> costs of {{three types of}} log <b>hauling</b> trucks was carried out at three logging companies in West Kalimantan in 1988. Three types of logging trucks, i. e. Nissan with semi trailer, Berliet with semi trailer and Nissan truck, were observed. The productivities of trucks were gathered through time study while the <b>hauling</b> costs were calculated based on secondary data. The purpose of the investigation is to find <b>hauling</b> productivities, operating costs of trucks and <b>hauling</b> costs. The {{results of the investigation}} are as follows :The average <b>hauling</b> productivities of Nissan with semi trailer, Berliet with semi trailer and Nissan trucks are 484, 99 m 3 km/hour, 492, 02 m 3 km/hour and 292, 07 m 3 km/hour, respectively. The average <b>hauling</b> costs of Nissan with semi trailer, Berliet with semi trailer and Nissan Trucks are Rp. 63, 08 /m 3 km, Rp. 64, 66 /m 3 km and Rp. 84, 39 /m 3 km, respectively. The differences in both the <b>hauling</b> productivities and <b>hauling</b> costs either between Nissan logging truck with semi trailer and Nissan loging truck or between Berliet logging truck with semi-trailer and Nissan logging truck were highlysignificant because of the differences in logging truck capacities, transport distances and driver skills. But the <b>hauling</b> productivities and <b>hauling</b> costs between Berliet logging truck with semi-trailer and Nissan logging truck with semi trailer did not differ significantly because the logging truck capacities, transport distance and driver skill in PT.

The Winton Train departed on 1 September 2009, the 70th anniversary of the eighth, and intended last, train arranged by Winton to carry children to safety but was prevented from doing so due to the outbreak of World War II on that very day. It departed from Prague Main railway station and travelled through Germany and the Netherlands. After a transfer by ferry to Harwich, the journey resumed by train again to arrive in London's Liverpool Street station on 4 September, where it was met by the 100-year-old Sir Nicholas himself.
