40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to present the main {{features}} of detonation generation and propagation in liquid explosives. Most of the results are related to Nitromethane (NM) since it is the most studied liquid explosive. Depending on whether they are homogeneous or heterogeneous, explosive media have specific <b>detonic</b> properties which are related to different heat release mechanisms. Before describing the ignition, propagation and extinction of a detonation in a liquid explosive charge, it is useful to recall some specific features of liquid explosives...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mathematical Sciences. Applied Mathematics)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. During {{the design}} or {{acquisition}} of missile systems {{the effectiveness of}} the system needs to be evaluated. Often actual testing is not possible and therefore mathematical models need to be constructed and solved with the aid of software. The current simulation model is investigated, verified, and a mathematical model to aid {{in the design of the}} <b>detonic</b> payload, developed. The problem is confined to the end-game scenario with the developed simulation model focusing on the last milliseconds before warhead detonation. The model, that makes use of the raytracing methodology, models the warhead explosion in the vicinity of a target and calculates the probability of kill for the specific warhead design against the target. Using the data generated by the simulation model, the warhead designer can make the necessary design changes to improve the design. A heuristic method was developed and is discussed which assists in this design process. There is, however, a large population of possible designs. Meta-heuristic methods may be employed in reducing this population and to help confine the manual search to a considerably smaller search area. A fuze detection model as well as the capability to generate truly random intercept scenarios was developed as to enable employment of meta-heuristic search methods. The simulation model, as well as design optimising technology, has successfully been incorporated into a Windows based software package known as EVA (The Effectiveness and Vulnerability Analyser) ...|$|R

5000|$|Originally, James [...] "Sonny" [...] Crockett {{was to use}} a SIG Sauer P220 in [...]45 Auto {{which is}} evident in the pilot episode. He also carries a <b>Detonics</b> Pocket 9 as a backup, tucked in his rear {{waistband}} near the small of his back. But it was later decided that a more state-of-the-art gun was to be used by Don Johnson. During the first season, he used a Bren Ten pistol carried in a Ted Blocker [...] "Lifeline" [...] shoulder holster rig. Due to Don Johnson's dissatisfaction with the [...] "Lifeline" [...] rig, the Jackass Leather Company (later renamed Galco International) [...] "Original Jackass Rig" [...] shoulder holster rig was personally fitted for him by Rick Gallagher (President of Galco). Finally the Galco [...] "Miami Classic" [...] shoulder holster was designed and used. The Bren Ten, manufactured by Dornaus & Dixon, was a stainless steel handgun notable as the first ever chambered in the powerful 10mm Auto caliber. The Bren Ten was originally manufactured as a two-tone weapon: the carbon steel slide was black oxide and frame was stainless steel. The model used in Miami Vice had a hard chromed matte finished slide so that it showed up better during night shots. The pistol used in the show was chambered in [...]45 ACP, as opposed to the standard 10mm Auto. After the Dornaus & Dixon company went out of business in 1986, the product placement contract went to Smith & Wesson. Starting with the third season, Sonny used a 2nd Generation series Smith & Wesson Model 645. This was a full-sized 5-inch-barreled stainless steel service pistol in [...]45ACP. Galco Gunleather, formerly Jackass Leather Co., built a [...] "Miami Classic" [...] shoulder holster for the S&W 645 used. In the Galco Gunleather headquarters, there is a large display that contains the Miami Vice shoulder holster rig that Don Johnson wore, accompanied by an autographed photo of him. In late 1988 Smith & Wesson unveiled their new 3rd Generation Series of auto pistols, so for the last season Sonny's Model 645 was replaced with the new Smith & Wesson Model 4506. This pistol had 20+ design improvements including a one piece arched grip. Sonny's M 4506 {{can be seen in the}} beginning of the episode [...] "Victim of Circumstance" [...] when he is sitting in a cafe and looking at it. Sonny also carried a [...]45 ACP <b>Detonics</b> Combat-Master backup gun in an ankle holster on his left leg, replacing the Pocket 9 from the pilot episode. It can be seen in the bar scene shootout in the [...] "Prodigal Son" [...] episodes. In the last series episode [...] "Freefall" [...] Crockett is placing what looks to be a S&W CS45 (compact alloy framed [...]45ACP) in his ankle holster.|$|E
5000|$|In 1988, a Gun World article {{detailed}} Grennell's {{efforts to}} update the [...]45 ACP for the 21st Century, a difficult endeavor due to the inherent design limitations of the veteran round. Introduced in the early 20th Century, the [...]45 ACP has a relatively large case capacity which was dictated by the relatively low pressure powders in use {{at the time of}} its development; as a result, it operates in the modest range of 19,900 - 22,000 Copper units of pressure (CUP). In contrast, current day cartridges using modern nitrocellulose powders generating higher pressure can produce a CUP in the 28,000 - 39,000 range. As it was originally designed for lower pressures, the [...]45 ACP case has relatively thin walls and weak case head and web specifications; it cannot reliably contain increased pressures. The layout of most M1911 pistols' chambers presents yet another challenge in that the case head is not fully supported in the cartridge feed ramp area; pushing the envelope in this critical area with too much pressure risks a catastrophic failure, resulting in a case bursting in the chamber. To rule out such a dangerous possibility, Grennell chose to use brass formed from the stronger and more modern [...]451 <b>Detonics,</b> shortened to the overall length of the [...]45 ACP design. Support for the case head was also addressed by adopting a new chamber and barrel design which supports the base area of the case. Other areas of the model 1911 pistol design were also strengthened, including the addition of a heavier recoil spring and a strengthened firing pin redesigned to prevent primer material from flowing into the firing pin channel under high chamber pressures.|$|E

40|$|It was Dr. Kamlet, 1986, who {{expressed}} vividly the deficiencies of detonation physics, Since detonation physics {{is based on}} first principles his statements at that time were a matter of utmost courage! In his memory it seems appropriate to try a proof of falsification of this classical theory {{in the sense of}} Karl Popper, and to suggest a new approach. <b>Detonics</b> is the science of pressure fronts, and pressure sources. Generally. phenomena near a pressure source cannot be described in plane wave terms as the classical theory does. With increasing distance from the pressure origin plane wave descriptions improve. These become physically fully correct at distances from the pressure front where <b>detonics</b> is no longer of interest. Without a knowledge of the differences between spherical and plane wave descriptions one cannot estimate the associated errors, nor is there any real understanding of important phenomena. Therefore, in tiny plane wave description of <b>detonics</b> there appear 'pathological' phenomena, and it is necessary to invoke several assumptions in order to arrive at a description that is in accord with real experience. The intent of this contribution is, to point out the basic errors of plane wave <b>detonics,</b> and the automatic implications of the said pathological events by using a physically appropriate approach in terms of a spherical wave description. A consequence of this approach is the conclusion that explosive phenomena are not restricted to energetic materials, but can occur in any dynamically excited two-phase system, even without any chemical reaction, The considerations are valid for condensed systems. while for gases other thermoacoustic and resonance phenomena come into play...|$|E

40|$|By {{using the}} Hugoniot curve in <b>detonics</b> as a Riemann {{invariant}} of a velocity-pressure model, {{we get a}} conservative hyperbolic system similar to the Euler equations. The only differences are the larger value of the adiabatic constant (= 8. 678 instead of 1. 4 for gas dynamics) and the mass density replaced by a strain density depending on the pressure. The model is not homogeneous since it involves a gravity and a friction term. After the seismic wave reaches up {{the bottom of the}} ocean, one gets a pressure wave propagating toward the surface, which is made of a frontal shock wave followed by a regular decreasing profile. Since this regular profile propagates faster than the frontal shock waves, the amplitude of the pressure wave is strongly reduced when reaching the surface.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{the last}} 50 years, very many new {{energetic}} compounds {{have been made}} as potential ingredients for explosive, propellant and pyrotechnic formulations. Of these compounds very few {{have come to be}} used in military munitions. To obtain a better understanding of why this has been the case and to help address the discrepancy, the NATO Insensitive Munitions Information Centre (NIMIC) held a workshop in June 1994 open to representatives from government and industry within NIMTC member nations, to study what it is that makes a new energetic material useable. Issues that were addressed included:-what is currently being used from the current understanding of <b>detonics</b> and molecular modelling in the targeting and preparation of new energetic materials;-what use is made by the energetic materials designer of present capabilities to predict the performance and safety of new compounds and formulations;-what do the users require of predictive resources and molecular modelling in order to target more potentially useful new energetic materials;-what are the user's requirements for useful new energetic materials and can these be interpreted as quantitative properties of energetic molecules. This paper presents a short summary of those conclusions of this NIMIC workshop that are relevant in the field of the understanding and modelling of detonation at a molecular level. 1...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{improvements}} and modifications of the imaging techniques have identified and provided measurements of Raleigh-Taylor (R-T) instabilities {{that occur in}} these events. The microscope system in the LLNL Micro <b>Detonics</b> Facility, was converted to an epi-illuminated polarization configuration. A double pulse nanosecond illuminator and a second independently focusable frame camera were also added to the system. A laser driven plate, that is a dense solid driven by a laser heated, lower density plasma, is inherently R-T unstable. The plates are aluminum, deposited {{on the ends of}} optical fibers. They are launched by a YAG Laser pulse traveling down the fiber. Plate velocities are several kilometers per second and characteristic dimensions of the instabilities are a few to tens of microns. Several techniques were used to examine the plates, the most successful being specularly reflecting polarization microscopy looking directly at the plate as it flies toward the camera. These images gave data on the spatial frequencies of the instabilities but could not give the amplitudes. To measure the amplitude of the instability a semi- transparent witness plate was placed a known distance from the plate. As above, the plate was observed using the polarization microscope but using the streak camera as the detector. Both the launch of the plate and its impact into the witness plate are observed on the streak record. Knowing the plate velocity function from earlier velocimetry measurements and observing the variations in the arrival time across the plate, the amplitude of the instability can be calculated...|$|E
40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} pulse (EMP) {{resulting from the}} detonation of nuclear explosives is a documented and studied phenomenon. What is less well known and understood is the simi- lar yet considerably less powerful occurrence surrounding the detonation of high explosives. The phenomenon was rst noticed by Kolsky in 1954 during his investigation into stress waves using explosive charges. This project was undertaken to identify any discernible eld or wave in the low frequency EM spectrum, focusing particularly on the magnetic eld. The work published by Soloviev in 2002 and Adushkin in 2004 served as guidelines on test procedure and setup. Testing of this nature was {{not found in the}} literature to have been previously conducted in South Africa and is multi-disciplinary, involving the elds of <b>detonics</b> and signal processing. The test procedure implemented proved valid as signals were detected and su cient data were gathered to perform basic pattern recognition and spectral frequency analysis. The analysis allowed for comments to be made on the relationship between the signal and other characteristics surrounding the event. Inside the frequency band investigated there appeared to be two bands of activity in the kHz range, which is consistent with previously published works. The repeatability of the waveforms shape for identical blasts was good but with the limited sample size a proper database could not be developed. Provisionally {{it can be said that}} such events do have characteristic shapes. Testing revolved around small charges and was conducted in the near eld. This removed the possibility of commenting on orientation factors. The testing was a success in terms of recording magnetic eld signals from the detonation of high explosives...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The novel candidate high energy insensitive explosive; 2, 5 -diamino- 3, 6 -dinitropyrazine (ANPZ-i) has been prepared in acceptable overall yield. ANPZ-i was synthesised by the nitration of 2, 5 -diethoxypyrazine using nitronium tetrafluoroborate (NO 2 +BF 4 -) in sulfolane and the subsequent amination of 2, 5 -diethoxy- 3, 6 -dinitropyrazine, under autoclave conditions. Oxidation studies towards the dioxide derivative of ANPZ-i, 2, 5 -diamino- 3, 6 -dinitropyrazine- 1, 4 -dioxide (PZDO), were unsuccessful. The synthesis of existing high explosives; 2, 6 -diamino- 3, 5 -dintropyrazine (ANPZ) and 2, 6 -diamino- 3, 5 -dinitropyrazine- 1 -oxide (PZO) has been scaled up to produce approximately 25 g batches of material. A number of novel nitrations using NO 2 +BF 4 - {{have been carried out}} on a range of chloro-, methyl- and hydroxy-functionalised quinoxalines and quinazolines. A range of novel functionalisations have also been carried out on the platform molecule; 2, 4 -diamino- 6, 8 -dinitroquinazoline giving rise to 2, 4 -diamino- 6, 8 -dinitroquinazoline- 1, 3 -dioxide (di-N-oxidation product), 2, 4, 7 -triamino- 6, 8 -dinitroquinazoline (monoamination product) and 2, 4, 6, 8 -tetra-aminoquinazoline (dihydrogenation product). <b>Detonics</b> molecular modelling was carried out on the following target molecules: 2, 5 -diamino- 3, 6 -dinitropyrazine- 1, 4 -dioxide (PZDO), 2, 5, 8 -triamino- 3, 6, 7 -trinitroquinoxaline- 1 -oxide and 2, 5, 7 -triamino- 4, 6, 8 -trinitroquinazoline- 1 -oxide. The detonation velocity of the new explosive molecule; 2, 5 -diamino- 3, 6 -dinitropyrazine (ANPZ-i) was calculated and it was found to be a similar value to that obtained experimentally for the existing high explosive RDX. Calculation by molecular modelling of the steric energies of ANPZ, PZO, ANPZ-i and PZDO gave a quantitative assessment of the difficulty in oxidising ANPZ-i to give PZDO. Extensive analysis of carbon- 13 NMR spectroscopy shift values was carried out for approximately twenty nitrogen heterocyclic compounds. Comparison of shift values indicated consistency in the interpretations. On-line literature searches have shown that the following compounds prepared in this project are new: 2, 3, 6 -trichloro- 5 -nitroquinoxaline, 2, 3 -dimethoxy- 6, 7 -dinitroquinoxaline, 2, 3, 6 -trichloroquinoxaline- 1 -oxide, 2, 4 -diamino- 6, 8 -dinitroquinazoline- 1, 3 -dioxide, 2, 4, 7 -triamino- 6, 8 -dinitroquinazoline and 2, 5 -diamino- 3, 6 -dinitropyrazine (ANPZ-i). Furthermore, new synthetic routes have been used in the preparation of the following compounds: 2, 3 -dichloro- 5 -nitroquinoxaline, 2, 3, 6, 7 -tetrachloro- 5 -nitroquinoxaline, 2 -hydroxy- 6 -nitroquinoxaline, 2 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl- 6 -nitroquinoxaline and 2, 5 -diethoxy- 3, 6 -dinitropyrazine...|$|E
