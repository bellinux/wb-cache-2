40|$|This work {{presents}} the first practical selective emitter for high performance thermophotovoltaics (TPV) that offers high optical performance, high temperature stability, {{and the ability}} to be fabricated in large area samples. In a TPV system, a heat source brings the photonic crystal emitter to incandescence, and the resulting thermal radiation drives a low-bandgap photovoltaic cell. The photonic crystal enables high eciency by enhancing the radiation from the heat source in the wavelength range that can be converted by the photovoltaic cell and suppressing the radiation outside of that range. Our photonic crystal, composed of a square array of cylindrical cavities etched into a metallic substrate, enables unprecedented efficiencies in solar, radioisotope, and hydrocarbon TPV systems. We overcome multiple technical challenges previously limiting selective emitters by developing new fabrication processes to improve optical performance; by adopting commercial poly-crystalline tantalum to fabricate large-area samples; by developing a HfO₂ passivation coating for improved thermo-chemical stability; and by developing a HfO₂ cavity filing process for improved omnidirectional performance. More specically, we developed a process for fabrication of uniformly patterned 50 mm diameter photonic crystals, integratable with virtually any heat source by brazing. Furthermore, we fabricated a photonic crystal in a sputtered tantalum coating, which can be directly sputtered onto a heat source. Our photonic crystal design reaches 67 % of the performance of an <b>ideal</b> <b>emitter.</b> To further improve the omnidirectional performance, we fabricated a filled-cavity emitter, which experimentally demonstrated the theoretical prediction that HfO 2 -filled photonic crystals would have superior hemispherical in-band emissivity. Both fabricated photonic crystal designs were tested for 300 hours at 100 °C with no detectable degradation due to the passivation by HfO₂. With our original design, we demonstrated the highest heat-to-electricity eciency in a hydrocarbon TPV experiment to-date, exceeding 4 % and greater than previous 2 - 3 % effissences thought to be the practical limit. Furthermore, we expect from simulations that our filled photonic crystal design will enable over 12 % eciency with only engineering optimization. For reference, a 1. 5 % eciency corresponds to the energy density of lithium ion batteries. by Veronika Stelmakh. Thesis: Ph.

The {{synthesis}} of Iridium(III) phosphorescent complexes {{has attracted a}} lot of attention due to their potential of serving as key components for various optoelectronic applications, such as phosphorescent emitters for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDS). Among these complexes homoleptic and heteroleptic cyclometalated phenylpyridine derivatives of Ir(III) have been widely studied due to the relatively short lifetime of the triplet excited state, high emission efficiency and tunable emission color. While there are many green and red emitters that meet the requirements of device design, the development of blue phosphorescent emitters remains a challenge.

As is mentioned above, CNT arrays have great potentials for the applications of plasma-flashover cathodes due to their excellent field emission properties [5 – 8]. Whereas the reports that focus on the plasma-induced emission properties of CNT arrays under the high-voltage pulse electric field are very few. Therefore, the studies on the field emission properties of CNTs under the pulse electric field are very important as well as under the DC electric field.|$|R

40|$|Motivated by {{the ongoing}} debate about nanophotonic control of Foerster {{resonance}} energy transfer (FRET), notably {{by the local}} density of optical states (LDOS), we study an analytic model system wherein a pair of <b>ideal</b> dipole <b>emitters</b> - donor and acceptor - exhibit energy transfer {{in the vicinity of}} an ideal mirror. The FRET rate is controlled by the mirror up to distances comparable to the donor-acceptor distance, that is, the few-nanometer range. For vanishing distance, we find a complete inhibition or a four-fold enhancement, depending on dipole orientation. For mirror distances on the wavelength scale, where the well-known `Drexhage' modification of the spontaneous-emission rate occurs, the FRET rate is constant. Hence there is no correlation between the Foerster (or total) energy transfer rate and the LDOS. At any distance to the mirror, the total energy transfer between a closely-spaced donor and acceptor is dominated by Foerster transfer, i. e., by the static dipole-dipole interaction that yields the characteristic inverse-sixth-power donor-acceptor distance dependence in homogeneous media. Generalizing to arbitrary inhomogeneous media with weak dispersion and weak absorption in the frequency overlap range of donor and acceptor, we derive two main theoretical results. Firstly, the spatially dependent Foerster energy transfer rate does not depend on frequency, hence not on the LDOS. Secondly the FRET rate is expressed as a frequency integral of the imaginary part of the Green function. This leads to an approximate FRET rate in terms of the LDOS integrated over a huge bandwidth from zero frequency to about 10 times the donor emission frequency, corresponding to the vacuum-ultraviolet. Even then, the broadband LDOS hardly contributes to the energy transfer rates. We discuss practical consequences including quantum information processing. Comment: 17 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

Thus, {{they are the}} basis {{of some of the}} best optical clock setups to date. However, despite their minute optical dipole moments the inherent long range dipole-dipole interactions in such lattices generate line shifts, dephasing and modified decay. We show that in a perfectly filled lattice these effects are resonantly enhanced depending on lattice constant, lattice geometry and excitation scheme inducing clock shifts of many atomic linewidths and reducing measurement precision via superradiance. However, under optimal conditions collective effects can be exploited to yield zero effective shifts and prolong dipole lifetimes beyond the single atom decay. In particular we identify 2 D hexagonal or square lattices with lattice constants below the optical wavelength as most promising configurations for an accuracy and precision well below the independent ensemble limit. This geometry should also be an ideal basis for related applications such as superradiant lasers, precision magnetometry or long lived quantum memories.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} theoretical {{study of the}} magnetic field dependence of the near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) between two parallel plates. We show that when the plates are made of doped semiconductors, the near-field thermal radiation can be severely affected by {{the application of a}} static magnetic field. We find that irrespective of its direction, the presence of a magnetic field reduces the radiative heat conductance, and dramatic reductions up to 700 % can be found with fields of about 6 T at room temperature. We show that this striking behavior {{is due to the fact}} that the magnetic field radically changes the nature of the NFRHT. The field not only affects the electromagnetic surface waves (both plasmons and phonon polaritons) that normally dominate the near-field radiation in doped semiconductors, but it also induces hyperbolic modes that progressively dominate the heat transfer as the field increases. In particular, we show that when the field is perpendicular to the plates, the semiconductors become <b>ideal</b> hyperbolic near-field <b>emitters.</b> More importantly, by changing the magnetic field, the system can be continuously tuned from a situation where the surface waves dominate the heat transfer to a situation where hyperbolic modes completely govern the near-field thermal radiation. We show that this high tunability can be achieved with accessible magnetic fields and very common materials like n-doped InSb or Si. Our study paves the way for an active control of NFRHT and it opens the possibility to study unique hyperbolic thermal emitters without the need to resort to complicated metamaterials.

40|$|The {{performance}} of organic semiconductor devices is {{heavily dependent on}} the precise molecular-level arrangement and overall morphology of the functional layers. In organic photovoltaic applications, exciton mobility, fission/fusion or dissociation, as well as charge transport and separation {{are some of the}} morphology-dependent processes that are of interest for efficient device design. In this work a combination of experimental and computational techniques are used to elucidate the behaviour of excitons in conjugated polymer and small-molecule semiconductor systems. While there is an emphasis on photovoltaic applications, many concepts are generally applicable to other organic electronic applications such organic light emitting diodes and photodetectors. In Chapter 3, a pump-push-probe transient absorption technique is used to observe high-energy “hot” excitons formed by photoexcitation of the conjugated polymer poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT). The work demonstrates the ability to clearly isolate the transient signal of the hot exciton decay processes from the thermalised exciton population, where picosecond and sub-picosecond relaxation of hot excitons through torsional motion in the disordered polymer chain is observed. In addition, the push-induced dissociation of high-energy excitons into free charge carriers is able to be quantified and an upper bound on the exciton binding energy determined. Spectroscopic experiments on P 3 HT are accompanied by a hybrid quantum-classical exciton hopping model in Chapter 4. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics are used to obtain realistic structures of P 3 HT free chains and nanofibre aggregates, to which a Frenkel–Holstein exciton model and Monte Carlo hopping simulation is applied. This novel approach captures exciton transport properties of polymer systems with a monomer-level of detail unachievable with continuum or lattice style models, but at a large scale infeasible with fully quantum calculations. Reasonable quantitative agreement with experimental observables is obtained, offering insight into the morphology-dependence of exciton transport in conjugated polymers. In particular, the observed tendency for exciton migration to the core of the polymer aggregate can explain the relatively poor {{performance of}} highly crystalline or nanofibre-based polymer solar cells, as well as the unusually high fluorescence yield of aqueous P 3 HT nanoparticles. The effect of disorder in small molecule semiconductor films is investigated in Chapter 5 in the context of singlet exciton fission and triplet fusion under the influence of applied magnetic fields. A model is presented that extends the historical theory of molecular spin interactions in crystalline materials and corrects the current understanding in the literature regarding such disordered solid-phase systems. The possibility of using the fluorescence response to magnetic fields to probe the morphology and degree disorder in the films is demonstrated. Extending the model to solution-phase behaviour is then discussed in Chapter 6, where the potential of improving the light-harvesting ability of solar cells through a molecular triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion process is considered. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to obtain physical parameters and collision geometry of the emitter molecules in solution. The complications of applying a static model of triplet fusion to the dynamic solution-phase behaviour are elucidated and the potential of synthesising an <b>ideal</b> upconversion <b>emitter</b> molecule is discussed.

40|$|Thesis (DSc) [...] PU for CHE, 1987 It is {{well known}} that Very High Energy Gamma kay Astronomy (VHEGRA) is facing a dilemma in the sense that all {{reported}} sources are very weak emitters of VHE 1 -rays. The status of most sources are also questionable on statistical grounds, while very few sources have been confirmed. This dilemma can be solved by improving the sensitivities of telescopes. In this study it is however reasoned that some light can be shed on this dilemma by treating the data. in a more consistent way. Since one is dealing with a strong stochastic component of background cosmic radiation, the data should be analysed by means of sound statistical techniques. The analysis of low counting statistics are treated, with the accent on periodic analysis. Existing statistical tests for uniformity on a circle are reviewed and it is concluded that they are only usable if one has some a priori information about the form of the light curve. A 'new'' test (the Hm-test) is developed to identify sources for which the form of the light curve is unknown. It is also shown how one can overestimate ·the significance of a signal if a search is conducted within one independent Fourier spacing: With the Rayleigh test one can report a 'probability for uniformity' which is a factor of three too small, while this factor can be up to twenty for tests like z 210 or Pearson's x 2 -test with twenty bins. It is also shown how a x-ray light curve can be estimated from the data (phases) alone without making any ad hoc assumptions. It is a fact that such a light curve estimator will converge to the true unknown light curve if the sample size increases to infinity and if the phases are independently and identically distributed. The MeV light curve of the Vela pulsar (using the COS-B data) is estimated as an example. It is also shown how the signal strength of a periodic source can be estimated in some cases. The isolated pulsar PSR 1509 - 58 is identified by means of the Hm-test at a confidence level of 99. 9 ': [...] The light curve is a triple sinusoid and it is shown that the observed radiation from night to night is steady and coherent. The data on PSR 1802 - 23 are reanalysed, taking the effect of oversampling within one independent Fourier spacing into account. Indications of steady emission is found at a confidence level of 98. 6 %. Existing models for r-ray emission from isolated pulsars are investigated with the aim of predicting the VHE r-ray luminosity. It is found that only millisecond pulsars can produce observable VHE polar cap r-rays while an outer gap near the light cylinder can provide observable VHE r-rays from pulsars like Crab, Vela and PSR 1509 - 58. The outer gap model provides consistent results {{in the sense that the}} predicted MeV and TeV luminosities agree with COS-B and VHE observations respectively From the existing theory of outer gaps it is found that transients above 1 TeV should occur more often than transients below 3 GeV. It is also shown from this theory that a pulsar with the tentatively identified parameters of PSR 1802 - 23 is an <b>ideal</b> VHE <b>emitter.</b> Furthermore, certain pulsars can be MeV quiet but TeV loud. Finally, there may be one or more pulsars in the Southern Sky which could cause the observed count rate to double - thus solving the VHEGRA dilemma. Doctora...|$|R

Resonance fluorescence of the excitonic transition in epitaxial quantum dots (QDs) has also caught the attention of the community 1 as it can generate high quality, dephasing-free photons which inherit the laser properties in terms of coherence in the resonant Rayleigh scattering regime 2 Our sample consists of self-assembled InAs/GaAs QDs embedded in a planar GaAs microcavity formed by two distributed-Bragg reflectors.

One-photon interference experiments demonstrate that when decreasing the excitation power, we enter in a regime where, due to resonant Rayleigh scattering, the emitted photons inherit the same coherence of the excitation source.
