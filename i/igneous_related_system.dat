40|$|This is {{the first}} of two {{significant}} assessments of the geological energy potential of the U. S. The second one is U. S. G. S. Circular 790. Systems analyzed include: Hydrothermal convection systems (with estimates of potential for many specific sites in the West), <b>Igneous</b> <b>related</b> <b>systems</b> (<b>related</b> to current or recent volcanism), Estimates of the conductive transport of heat in most areas of CONUS, Recovery of heat from molten igneous systems (magma), and Geopressured geothermal energy in the Gulf Coast area. The significance of this report is that it began to give policy makers a first handle on the quantities and qualities of geothermal energy in the ground in much of the U. S.

40|$|Nonlocally related partial {{differential}} equation (PDE) systems {{are useful in}} the analysis of a given PDE system. It is known that each local conservation law of a given PDE system systematically yields a nonlocally <b>related</b> <b>system.</b> In this paper, a new and complementary method for constructing nonlocally <b>related</b> <b>systems</b> is introduced. In particular, it is shown that each point symmetry of a given PDE system systematically yields a nonlocally <b>related</b> <b>system.</b> Examples include applications to nonlinear diffusion equations, nonlinear wave equations and nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations. As a consequence, previously unknown nonlocal symmetries are exhibited for two examples of nonlinear wave equations. Moreover, since the considered nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations have no local conservation laws, previous methods do not yield nonlocally <b>related</b> <b>systems</b> for such equations...|$|R
