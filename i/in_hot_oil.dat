5|$|In India carrots {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} ways, as salads or as {{vegetables}} added to spicy rice or dal dishes. A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has carrots grated and cooked in milk until the whole mixture is solid, after which nuts and butter are added. Carrot salads are usually made with grated carrots with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green chillies popped <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> <b>oil.</b> Carrots can also be cut in thin strips and added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables or can be blended with tamarind to make chutney.|$|E
25|$|In some areas, {{particularly}} the American South, turkeys {{may also be}} deep fried <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> <b>oil</b> (often peanut oil) for 30 to 45 minutes by using a turkey fryer. Deep frying turkey {{has become something of}} a fad, with hazardous consequences for those unprepared to safely handle the large quantities of hot oil required.|$|E

Many specialty shops still use sesame oil or tea seed oil, {{and it is}} thought certain compounds in these oils help to produce light, crispier batter.|$|E

25|$|In the {{northern}} part of Colombia, they are used to prepare a fritter called buñuelo. The beans are immersed in water for a few hours to loosen their skins and soften them. The skins are then removed either by hand or {{with the help of a}} manual grinder. Once the skins are removed, the bean is ground or blended, and eggs are added, which produces a soft mix. The mix is fried <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> <b>oil.</b> It makes a nutritious breakfast meal.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacture}} of the chains involved several processes: The {{figure of eight}} links were punched from a sheet of steel and assembled three deep with the centre link overlapping the two outer, like a bicycle chain. The links were held together with rivets cut from steel wire and hooks punched from sheet metal were attached to either end. The entire chain was filed smooth, burnished and tempered <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> <b>oil.</b> Because the work was so fine, the chains were often thinner than a piece of cotton thread, a magnifying instrument was required. In addition it was common practice to place a glass globe filled with water {{in front of a}} candle and a mirror behind to increase the light. By 1793 Robert Cox had a monopoly on chain production in Britain, supplying watch, clock and chronometer makers throughout the country. Production flourished and in 1845 William Hart opened a similar factory in Bargates. It was built to an advanced design with particularly large windows on either side. 74' long but only 18' wide, it allowed the maximum amount of natural light to enter.|$|E
500|$|Deep frying food {{is defined}} as a process where food is {{completely}} submerged <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> <b>oil</b> at temperatures typically between [...] and [...] One common method for preparing food for deep frying involves adding multiple layers of batter around the food, such as cornmeal, flour, or tempura; breadcrumbs may also be used. After the food is submerged in oil, the surface of it begins to dehydrate and it undergoes Maillard reactions which break down sugars and proteins, creating the golden brown exterior of the food. Once the surface is dehydrated, it forms a crust which prevents further oil absorption. The heat conducts throughout the food causing proteins to denature, starches to undergo starch gelatinization, and dietary fiber to soften.|$|E

2500|$|A {{variation}} of tempeh cooking method, this type is {{often found in}} Purwokerto. The origin of the word mendoan is from Banyumas regional dialect, which means [...] "to cook instantly in very hot oil", that results in product cooked on the outside, but raw or partially cooked on the inside, and soft texture. The tempeh is dipped into spiced flour dressing before frying it <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> <b>oil</b> for a short time. Tempe mendoan may seem like half-cooked, soft-fried tempeh, unlike common crisp, fully deep-fried tempeh.|$|E

30|$|The {{concept of}} using hot {{watering}} is like <b>hot</b> <b>oiling,</b> and {{this method is}} used {{as an alternative to}} it. Water contains a higher heat capacity than the oil, for the same temperature, making it an interesting solution and cost effective. The other advantage of hot water is that water does not contain contaminants that may be present in oil (Khandekar 2015). However, hot water cannot provide the solvency available <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> <b>oiling.</b> Furthermore, surfactants need to be added to help the dispersion of wax into the water phase. To be effective, the surfactant needs to be in contact with melted paraffin, otherwise the mixture of water and surfactant will produce very large water-wet particles of wax. To demulsify the water-wet waxes solution, greater amounts of demulsifier needs to be used than usually used in the two-phase water and oil.|$|R
2500|$|Scholars {{think that}} wok (or pan) frying {{may have been}} used as early as the Han dynasty (206 B.C.– 220 A.D.) for drying grain, not for cooking, {{but it was not until}} the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) that the wok reached its modern shape and allowed quick cooking <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> <b>oil.</b> [...] Well into the 20th century, while {{restaurants}} and affluent families could afford the oil and fuel needed for stir fry, the most widely used cooking techniques remained boiling and steaming. Stir fry cooking came to predominate over the course of the century as more people could afford oil and fuel, and in the West spread beyond Chinese communities.|$|E
2500|$|The corn dog, pogo, dagwood dog, pluto pup or corny dog {{is a hot}} dog {{coated in}} cornbread batter and deep fried <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> <b>oil,</b> {{although}} some are baked. Almost all corn dogs are served on wooden sticks, though some early versions were stickless. Although a contending topic as numerous claims {{of the origins of}} the corn dog have surfaced, the earliest reference to what resembles a corn dog appeared in U.S. patent 1,706,491 filed in 1927 by Stanley S. Jenkins and issued in 1929. A competing claim to the invention of the corn dog is by George Boyington, the creator of Pronto Pups (made of pancake batter) who in 1938 or 1939, created a [...] "batter-dipped, deep fried hot dog" [...] after a rain storm in Rockaway Beach, Oregon ruined and made his hot dogs mushy. Another story is that Neil Fletcher supposedly invented corn dogs, first selling them at the Texas State Fair in 1942.|$|E

60|$|The Soudan Administration, by {{the little}} I heard, is a queer service. It extends itself in silence from {{the edges of}} Abyssinia to the swamps of the Equator at an average {{pressure}} of one white man to several thousand square miles. It legislates according to the custom of the tribe where possible, and on the common sense of the moment {{when there is no}} precedent. It is recruited almost wholly from the army, armed chiefly with binoculars, and enjoys a death-rate a little lower than its own reputation. It {{is said to be the}} only service in which a man taking leave is explicitly recommended to get out of the country and rest himself that he may return the more fit to his job. A high standard of intelligence is required, and lapses are not overlooked. For instance, one man on leave in London took the wrong train from Boulogne, and instead of going to Paris, which, of course, he had intended, found himself at a station called Kirk Kilissie or Adrianople West, where he stayed for some weeks. It was a mistake that might have happened to any one on a dark night after a stormy passage, but the authorities would not believe it, and when I left Egypt were busily engaged in boiling him <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> <b>oil.</b> They are grossly respectable in the Soudan now.|$|E
