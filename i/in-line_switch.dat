40|$|In this work, a 4 -bit pipelined ADC that {{provides}} the high speed conversion needed in UWB applications with sampling frequency of the order 50 Gbps is proposed. The pipelined ADC designed uses a high speed 1 -bit comparator, wide band amplifier, sampling circuit and a high speed buffer. The individual blocks are designed using 130 nm CMOS low power library cells. The individual blocks are designed to operate at a frequency greater than 50 Gbps sampling rate. In order to operate increase the operating frequency of the pipelined ADC, Specific new design techniques/algorithms such as power-efficient, capacitor ratio-independent conversion scheme, a pipeline stage-scaling algorithm, a nested CMOS gain-boosting technique, an amplifier and comparator sharing technique, {{and the use of}} minimum channel-length, thin oxide transistors with clock bootstrapping and <b>in-line</b> <b>switch</b> techniques are adopted...|$|E
50|$|By {{connecting}} {{one or more}} 4-way (intermediate) <b>switches</b> <b>in-line,</b> with 3-way <b>switches</b> {{at either}} end, the load can be controlled from three or more locations. Toggling any switch changes {{the state of the}} load from off to on, or from on to off.|$|R
50|$|The LifeChat LX-3000 is a wired headset {{that connects}} to a PC by a USB cable. The headset {{features}} a microphone on an adjustable boom that can rotate up and down. The headset {{also has an}} <b>in-line</b> volume control <b>switch</b> with a mute button and a Windows Live Call button that activates voice calls in Microsoft Windows. The LX-3000 uses the CM108 USB audio chip from C-Media.|$|R
40|$|Multiway {{switching}} {{has become}} nowadays quite frequently used in build-ing wiring. It {{can be defined}} as an interconnection of two or more electricalswitches in order to control an electrical load from more than one location. Although the electrical load is often a lamp, electrical outlets, fans, pumps,heaters or other appliances, it can also be controlled by multiway switching. However, in this paper we will deal only with lighting systems. Special switches are required to implement the system (three-way andfour-way switches) that have additional contacts, and extra wires must berun between them. In this way the light can be controlled from differentspots, e. g. {{the top and bottom of}} stairs or the end of a long hallway. Externally there is a resemblance between these switches and the standardsingle-pole ones. Extra connections make possible the control of a circuit frommultiple locations. By connecting one or more four-way <b>switches</b> <b>in-line,</b> withthree-way <b>switches</b> at either end, the light can be controlled from three ormore locations. Toggling any switch changes the state of the light from offto on, or from on to off. We would like to introduce a solution in this paper, based on FPGA forthe mentioned system and using HDL. The aim is to attain a high level ofgeneralization by applying any (even quite large) number of switches andlights...|$|R
40|$|A {{system is}} {{described}} for the on-line extraction of a digested protein in a gel spot. The extract obtained was on-line {{transferred to a}} precolumn, used to desalinate and preconcentrate the sample. The precolumn was <b>switched</b> <b>in-line</b> with an LC-ESI-MS system to separate the digest products prior to detection. By using this approach sample losses were minimized and the sample was quantitatively transferred. The benefits of the system were shown for the in-gel tryptic digest of several model proteins. Using this system, the sensitivity was 13 -fold increased compared to the off-line extraction of in-gel digest products leading to a higher sequence coverage and thus a better identification potential. Also, the within day repeatability was a factor 2. 5 improvement using the on-line procedure compared to the off-line extraction procedure. © 2005 Friedr. Vieweg & Sohn/GWV Fachverlage GmbH...|$|R
