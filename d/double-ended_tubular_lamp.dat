40|$|<b>Tubular</b> <b>lamp</b> {{industries}} nowadays {{are highly}} competitive {{in order to}} create the most-demanded products. The main factor of consumer 2 ̆ 7 s preferences in this product is quality, particularlythe durability as well as the price. Firstly, the longer a tubular/fluorescent lamp works - which indicates the quality of the fluorescent light - the better. The durability can be also a guideline for the company to determine the warranty cost by finding a value of Mean Time to Failure (MTTF). The next factor for consumers to buy or not to buy the lamp is the price of it. The price of a product can be obtained by calculating its production cost, invariably the warranty cost. In the case of <b>tubular</b> <b>lamp,</b> we use Free Replacement Warranty (FRW) policy and found that the warranty time given by the company for 365 days is precisely compared with the value of MTTF of 391 days.

50|$|LED tube {{lights are}} {{designed}} to physically fit in fixtures intended for fluorescent tubes. Some LED <b>tubular</b> <b>lamps</b> are {{intended to be a}} drop-in replacement into existing fixtures if appropriate ballast is used. Others require rewiring of the fixtures to remove the ballast. An LED tube lamp generally uses many individual Surface-Mounted LEDs which are directional and require proper orientation during installation as opposed to Fluorescent tube lamps which emit light in all directions around the tube. Most LED tube lights available can be used in place of T8, T10, or T12 tube designations, T8 is D26mm, T10 is D30mm, in lengths of 590 mm, 1200 mm and 1500 mm.|$|R
25|$|Many {{arrangements}} of electrical contacts are used. Large lamps {{may have a}} screw base (one or more contacts at the tip, one at the shell) or a bayonet base (one or more contacts on the base, shell used as a contact or used only as a mechanical support). Some <b>tubular</b> <b>lamps</b> have an electrical contact at either end. Miniature lamps may have a wedge base and wire contacts, and some automotive and special purpose lamps have screw terminals for connection to wires. Contacts in the lamp socket allow the electric current {{to pass through the}} base to the filament. Power ratings for incandescent light bulbs range from about 0.1 watt to about 10,000 watts.|$|R

50|$|In some devices, {{the light}} is so bright {{that it may not}} be easy to use indoors (i.e. in bedrooms).

40|$|The {{availability}} of T 5 high-efficiency (HE) and high-output (HO) fluorescent lamp families not only increases {{the number of}} commonly used <b>tubular</b> fluorescent <b>lamps</b> from 9 to 18, but more importantly, increases the chance of ballast-lamp mismatch because T 5 (HO) and T 5 (HE) lamps have similar physical outlooks and dimensions but vastly different lamp characteristics. The large number of lamp types increases the number of specific ballast designs and users have the new inconvenience of ensuring the correct matching of the lamps and ballasts. In this paper, a survey and analysis of lamp characteristics of all commonly used T 5, T 8 and T 12 <b>tubular</b> fluorescent <b>lamps</b> is presented. Based on the heated lamp electrodes, lamp voltage and lamp current, a classification system that maps the lamp characteristics into various groups for automatic lamp detection is proposed. The successful implementation of this method is explained and demonstrated. © 2009 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{previous}} experimental {{results on the}} catalytic growth of carbon nanotubes we developed a growth model. For this model we performed calculations and simulations which yielded predictions for the growth, as there are e. g. growth time and growth velocity. The calculated results are compared with experimental data obtained for the growth. Carbon nanotubes [1] have been studied {{for more than ten}} years and are now con-sidered for applications in miscellaneous devices such as <b>tubular</b> <b>lamps</b> [2], flat panel displays [3] and nanometric electronic devices [4, 5]. Such devices implies specific de-mands on the properties of the tubes, as the length, diameter and electronic proper-ties have a strong influence on the final performance of the device. Consequently nan-otube growth has to be controlled and understood. However, the growth mechanism is at present poorly understood, be it for arc discharge, laser ablation, or catalytic growth [6]. Based and inspired by previous results [7, 8] a new model for the growth of carbon nanotubes is proposed. Here, the possibility is demonstrated to calculate the growth of carbon nanotubes for this model by simple thermodynamics equations leading e. g. to the prediction of the growth velocity. Additionally, the heat generation and distributio...|$|R

50|$|As of 2012, several {{companies}} {{have started to}} offer self-ballasted metal-halide lamps as a direct replacement for incandescent and self-ballasted mercury-vapor lamps. These lamps include an arc tube with a starting electrode {{as well as a}} <b>tubular</b> halogen <b>lamp</b> which is connected in series and used to regulate the current in the arc tube. A resistor provides the current limiting for the starting electrode. Like self-ballasted mercury-vapor lamps, self-ballasted metal-halide lamps are connected directly to mains power and do not require an external ballast. In contrast to the former, these lamps usually have a clear outer bulb without a coating, making the arc tube and the halogen lamp tube clearly visible from the outside.|$|R

40|$|The gas {{temperature}} and the absolute {{density of the}} argon 4 S 3 P 2 level in an 80 W inductively coupled low-pressure argon - mercury plasma are determined for three different argon filling pressures. This is done by measuring the line profile of the 4 S 3 P 2 - 2 ̆ 6 gt; 4 P 3 D 3 transition in argon, using a tuneable laser diode. Since the width of this argon line is found {{to depend on the}} kinetic heavy particle temperature only, radial profiles of the {{gas temperature}} can be obtained. It turns out that the maximum gas temperature in this discharge (550 - 810 K depending on the filling pressure) is significantly higher than that in a common <b>tubular</b> fluorescent <b>lamp.</b> From the radial distribution of the argon 4 s density it can be concluded that the maxima of the electron density and of the electron temperature are situated close to the coil. It is also found that the position of these maxima depends on the argon filling pressure...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Dynamic foot {{pressure}} measurement is necessary particularly for diabetic patients to prevent ulcers, eventually leading to gangrene and amputation. The present work reports a low cost optical sensing {{system for the}} above, suitable for the Third World. It uses a horizontally placed transparent Acrylic plate with a webcam placed below facing upwards. A white paper, backed by a black adhesive plastic sheet, covered the whole plate on the top. Light from a <b>tubular</b> fluorescent <b>lamp</b> entered the acrylic plate from a side and traversed the thickness through total internal reflection. At points of pressure applied from the top, the air between the paper and the acrylic plate got displaced and caused breakdown of total internal reflection. The scattered light rays from the white sheet were recorded by the webcam. Computer software on Java platform was developed to grab and analyse video data to display dynamic pressure distribution in artificial colour contours. Approximate pressure calibration was obtained using static and dynamic values obtained from subjects with normal and abnormal foot pressures. Time graphs of pressure at user chosen points were also provided. The developed system worked with satisfaction and is being used for clinical assessment regularly...|$|R
