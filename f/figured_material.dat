40|$|Scotland, Edinburgh, {{consists}} of 591 palaeobotanical specimens, 54 {{of which are}} of type and/or figured status. A preliminary assessment of this collection, i the light of renewed interest in Hugh Miller's works in the bicentenary of his birth (2002), has provided new insights into this remarkable Scottish geologist.

Lower Aalenian Sorthat Formation and the (?) Upper Aalenian – Bathonian Bagå Formation. Ammonites are only known from the Hasle Formation, and all available ammonite specimens from this formation are described and <b>figured.</b> <b>Material</b> reported by previous authorshas been re-examined, together with previously undescribed specimens. Nine genera and eleven species are recognised. The ammonites show that the rocks from which they were collected fallinto the Lower Pliensbachian (Carixian) Substage. The lowermost subzone proved in the Hasle Formation is the basal Taylori Subzone of the Jamesoni Zone of the Northwest European Subboreal standard zonation, which marks a marine transgression over underlying marginal marine beds without ammonites belonging to the Rønne Formation. All subzones of the Jamesoni Zone are proved together with the Valdani Subzone of the Ibex Zone. The Upper Pliensbachian (Domerian) Substage, previously reported, is now thought to be unproved by ammonite evidence. The underlying and overlying Rønne and Sorthat Formations are dated by dinoflagellate cysts and terrestrial palynomorphs, and the ammonite occurrences provide important control points for palynostratigraphic dating of the succession...|$|E
40|$|Tristichopterids (Sarcopterygii, Tetrapodomorpha) form a {{monophyletic}} {{group of}} exclusively Devonian fishes. This thesis consists of descriptions of new material of tristichopterids and closely related taxa, {{as well as}} new interpretations and descriptions of previously <b>figured</b> <b>material.</b> Redescribed specimens were originally figured as far back as 1861, and publications as old as this are almost always of limited use as anatomical and systematical references, in addition to being difficult to acquire. The possibility of using new techniques and new theoretical frameworks also provides good justification for taking a second look at such specimens. In the case of this thesis, this includes the use of computed tomography scanning methods, and the cladistic approach to describing the interrelationships of taxa. The thesis includes a complete taxonomy of valid tristichopterid taxa, in addition to two new phylogenetic analyses incorporating the taxa that were described or redescribed. One of the analyses deals with the interrelationships of taxa along the entire tetrapod stem, and establishes the monophyly of the Tristichopteridae. The other analysis focuses on tristichopterid interrelationships. An account is given of evolutionary trends within Tristichopteridae, and instances of parallel evolution between tristichopterids and other tetrapodomorph groups are discussed. The biogeographical implications of tristichopterid occurences world-wide seem to corroborate the picture provided by other vertebrate groups, and give further support to one of two main hypotheses concerning the relative positions of Gondwana and Laurussia, the two major palaeocontinents during the Late Devonian. The supported hypothesis proposes a close proximity between southern Laurussia and northwestern Gondwana, as evidenced by the wide dispersal of derived tristichopterids by the Late Devonian. A Laurussian origin of tristichopterids is proposed...|$|E

Ela amplia o modelo dominante que organiza a informação imagética apenas em função da descrição dos ícones figurados nas imagens. A leitura de imagens implica em perceber a presença e o funcionamento característico dos três principais signos semióticos: o ícone, o índice e o símbolo. Nossa proposta de leitura conclui que a indexação deve ter quatro diferentes entradas para palavras-chave. As três primeiras de acordo com as características de cada um dos tipos de signos. Juntas, representam os predicados de um conceito. A última entrada apresenta o resultado da semiose, o(s) conceito(s) ou assunto(s) da imagem. Além de evidenciar os predicados do(s) conceito(s) de cada imagem, a abordagem evita que, em função da entrada única de termos, característica da indexação livre do tipo folksonômica, predomine a presença dos ícones, signos que representam objetos materiais figurados nas imagens e que são os primeiros a serem identificados em qualquer processo de leitura. Organizadas e tabuladas em diferentes entradas, as palavras-chave decorrentes da presença e funcionamento dos três tipos de signos e sintetizadas no(s) conceito(s) ampliam a disponibilidade de informação existente nas imagens de um sistema de organização da informação.

It expands the dominant model that organizes the imagery information only according to the description of figurative icons on the images. Reading images implies perceive the presence and the characteristic operation of the three main semiotic signs: the icon, index and symbol. Our proposed reading concludes that indexing should have four different entries for keywords. The first three according to the characteristics of each type of sign. Together, they represent the predicates of a concept. The last entry shows the result of semiosis, the (s) concept (s) or matter (s) of the image. Besides highlighting the predicates (s) concept (s) of each image, the approach avoids that, due to the single entry terms, free indexing feature of folksonomic type predominates the presence of icons, signs that represent <b>figured</b> <b>material</b> objects the images and {{are the first to}} be identified in any reading process.

For a quantum particle, the commutation relation of position and momentum observables entails Heisenberg's uncertainty relation. A third observable is presented which satisfies canonical commutation relations with both position and momentum. The resulting triple of pairwise canonical observables gives rise to a Heisenberg-type uncertainty relation for the product of three standard deviations. We derive the smallest possible value of this bound and determine the specific squeezed state which saturates the triple uncertainty relation. Quantum optical experiments are proposed to verify our findings. Comment: 5 pages, 2 <b>figures.</b> <b>Material</b> rearranged to match published versio...|$|R

Maximal incompatibility occurs if the observables give rise to regular polygons in phase space. We also conjecture a Hirschman-type uncertainty relation for N observables linear in position and momentum, generalizing the original relation which lower-bounds {{the sum of the}} position and momentum Shannon entropies of the particle.

40|$|A {{general theory}} of preparational {{uncertainty}} relations for a quantum particle in one spatial dimension is developed. We derive conditions which determine whether a given smooth function of the particle's variances and its covariance is bounded from below. Whenever a global minimum exists, an uncertainty relation has been obtained. The squeezed number states of a harmonic oscillator {{are found to be}} universal: no other pure or mixed states will saturate any such relation. Geometrically, we identify a convex uncertainty region in the space of second moments which is bounded by the inequality derived by Robertson and Schrödinger. Our approach not only unifies existing uncertainty relations but also leads to new inequalities for second moments.

We also investigate the geometry of the "uncertainty region" in the $N(2 N+ 1) $-dimensional space of moments. It is {{shown to be a}} convex set for any number continuous variables, and the points on its boundary found to be in one-to-one correspondence with pure Gaussian states of minimal uncertainty.
