50|$|Up until 1942, Fort Hertz was {{maintained}} as an outpost of the Myitkyina Battalion of the Burma Frontier Force. During the 1942 Japanese invasion of Burma, various retreating {{soldiers of the}} British/Indian Burma Garrison remained in the Fort <b>Hertz</b> <b>area.</b> The military authorities in India had no direct contact with Fort Hertz {{during most of the}} summer of 1942.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss our Þnite element {{procedure}} for simulating the hot rolling of ßat steel products. We couple an Eulerian rigid-viscoplastic model of the steel plates deformation to a Lagrangian elastic model of the rolls deformation. This latter model incorporates the bending deformation of the work rolls supported by the back-up rolls and the ßattening of the contact <b>areas</b> (<b>Hertz</b> problem) via an enhanced beam model. The Þnite element model is validated comparing its predictions with actual industrial measurements and then {{it is used to}} analyze different rolling set-ups. Key Words: metal forming; hot strip rolling; Þnite elements; thermal crown; roll bending; roll ßattening...|$|R
40|$|AbstractQuantum Dot Cellular Automata {{is one of}} {{the popular}} {{alternatives}} of CMOS technology. QCA technology has higher clock speed upto tetra <b>hertz</b> range, lesser <b>area</b> then CMOS and unlike charge dissipation QCA technology is based on charge confinement. In this paper we had proposed an algorithm for data flow in QCA circuits. The algorithm is based on potential energy of the dots of a QCA cell. With this algorithm the operation of any QCA based complex design can be evaluated using potential energy calculation. In this paper at first we had proposed the operation of basic QCA majority voter using this proposed algorithm. We have further evaluated the working principle of QCA tile structure based on the proposed algorithm...|$|R
