40|$|Background. The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the {{cost-effectiveness}} of cement-less versus hybrid prostheses in total hip replacement (THR) in patients diagnosed with primary osteoarthritis. Methods. Effectiveness data were obtained from the Emilia-Romagna Regional Registry on Orthopaedic Prosthesis (RIPO), which collects information on all orthopaedic intervention performed in Emilia-Romagna (41, 199 total hip replacements performed from 2000 to 2007), and from which we obtained survival curves and transition probabilities for the cement-less and hybrid prostheses, respectively. Conversely, costs were derived from regional databases through a specific procedure, which allowed us to register individual component's costs for both primary and subsequent revision interventions. A specific Markov transition model was constructed in order to consider the 3 types of revisions that an implant could possibly undergo through its life-span: total, cup or stem, <b>head</b> <b>insert</b> or neck. The cost-effectiveness was expressed in terms of cost per "revision-free" life year. Results and conclusions. Considering a 70 -y old patient undergoing THR, the cementless strategy resulted more effective but more costly than the hybrid solution, with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of 2401. 63 (sic) per revision-free life year. Following a deterministic sensitivity analysis, hybrid and cementless fixation showed, respectively, a dominance profile for patients older than 83 y and younger than 43 y, whereas for all ages in between, we report a progressive increase in the ICER of cementless prostheses. Our results proved to be robust, as underlined by the probabilistic sensitivity analysis performed using cost distributions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|New {{materials}} and corresponding manufacturing processes are likely candidates for diesel engine components as society and customers demand lower emission engines without sacrificing power and fuel efficiency. Strategies for improving thermal efficiency directly compete with methodologies for reducing emissions, {{and so the}} technical challenge becomes an optimization of controlling parameters to achieve both goals. Approaches being considered to increase overall thermal efficiency are to insulate certain diesel engine components in the combustion chamber, thereby increasing the {{brake mean effective pressure}} ratings (BMEP). Achieving higher BMEP rating by insulating the combustion chamber, in turn, requires advances in material technologies for engine components such as pistons, port liners, valves, and cylinder heads. A series of characterization tests were performed to establish the material properties of ceramic powder. Mechanical chacterizations were also obtained from the selected materials as a function of temperature utilizing ASTM standards: fast fracture strength, fatique resistance, corrosion resistance, thermal shock, and fracture toughness. All ceramic materials examined showed excellent wear properties and resistance to the corrosive diesel engine environments. The study concluded that the ceramics examined did not meet all of the cylinder <b>head</b> <b>insert</b> structural design requirements. Therefore we do not recommend at this time their use for this application. The potential for increased stresses and temperatures in the hot section of the diesel engine combined with the highly corrosive combustion products and residues has driven the need for expanded materials capability for hot section engine components. Corrosion and strength requirements necessitate the examination of more advanced high temperture alloys. Alloy developments and the understanding of processing, structure, and properties of supperalloy materials have been driven, in large part, by the gas turbine community over the last fifty years. Characterization of these high temperature materials has, consequently, concentrated heavily upon application conditions similiar to to that encountered in the turbine engine environment. Significantly less work has been performed on hot corrosion degradation of these materials in a diesel engine environment. This report examines both the current high temperature alloy capability and examines the capability of advanced nickle-based alloys and methods to improve production costs. Microstructures, mechanical properties, and the oxidation/corrosion behavior of commercially available silicon nitride ceramics were investigated for diesel engine valve train applications. Contact, sliding, and scratch damage mechanisms of commercially available silicon nitride ceramics were investigated as a function of microstructure. The silicon nitrides with a course microstructure showed a higher material removal rate that agrees with a higher wear volume in the sliding contact tests. The overall objective of this program is to develop catalyst materials systems for an advanced Lean-NOx aftertreatment system that will provide high NOx reduction with minimum engine fuel efficiency penalty. With Government regulations on diesel engine NOx emissions increasingly becoming more restrictive, engine manufacturers are finding it difficult to meet the regulations solely with engine design strategies (i. e. improved combustion, retarded timing, exhaust gas recirculation, etc.). Aftertreatment is the logical technical approach that will be necessary to achieve the required emission levels {{while at the same time}} minimally impacting the engine design and its associated reliability and durability concerns...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{anatomy of}} the distal biceps tendon and {{aponeurosis}} has not been studied in detail. Methods: Seventeen cadaver elbows were dissected with loupe magnification to identify {{the details of the}} distal bi-ceps tendon and the lacertus fibrosus. Results: In ten of the seventeen specimens, the distal biceps tendon was in two distinct parts, each a continuation of the long and short heads of the muscle. The remaining seven specimens showed interdigitation of the muscle dis-tally. The tendon continued from each muscle belly. The short <b>head</b> <b>inserted</b> distal to the radial tuberosity and was positioned to be a more powerful flexor of the elbow, while the tendon of the long <b>head</b> <b>inserted</b> on the tuberosity fur-ther from the axis of rotation of the forearm and was positioned to be a stronger supinator. The bicipital aponeurosis consisted of three layers and completely encircled the ulnar forearm flexor muscles. The aponeurosis may be impor-tant in stabilizing the tendons distally. Conclusions: The double tendon insertion may allow an element of independent function of each portion of the bi-ceps, and, during repair of an avulsion, the surgeon should ensure correct orientation of both tendon components. nlike the anatomy and pathophysiology of the proxi-mal end of the biceps muscle, the distal biceps tendon anatomy is poorly understood.

40|$|Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) {{from the}} Oregon State University (OSU) TRIGA{reg_sign} Reactor is {{currently}} being stored in thirteen 55 -gallon drums at the Hanford Site's low-level burial grounds. This fuel is soon to be retrieved from buried storage and packaged into new containers (overpacks) for interim storage at the Hanford Interim Storage Area (ISA). One of the key activities associated with this effort is final closure of the overpack by welding. The OSU fuel is placed into an overpack, a <b>head</b> <b>inserted</b> into the overpack top, and welded closed. Weld quality, for typical welded fabrication, is established through post-weld testing and nondestructive examination (NDE); however, in this case, once the SNF is placed into the overpack, routine testing and NDE are not feasible. An alternate approach is to develop and qualify the welding process/parameters, demonstrate beforehand that they produce the desired weld quality, and then verify parameter compliance during production welding.
