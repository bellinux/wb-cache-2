The combined {{effects of these}} two compounds {{may be responsible for}} the toxicity of methoxyflurane to some of the major organs of the human body. Methoxyflurane was determined to be nephrotoxic (damaging to the kidneys) in a dose-dependent response and hepatotoxic (damaging to the liver) at anesthetic doses in 1973, and the drug was abandoned as a general anesthetic in the late 1970s. In 1999, the manufacturer discontinued distribution of methoxyflurane in the United States and Canada, and on September 6, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration determined that it should be withdrawn from the market for safety concerns. It is however still used in Australia as an emergency analgesic for the initial management of pain due to acute trauma, as well as for brief painful procedures such as changing of wound dressings or for transport of injured people.|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{disinfection}} byproduct formation potential (DBPFP) {{of three}} surface waters with the {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) content of 2. 5, 5. 2, and 7. 9 mg/L was investigated. The formation and distribution of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids were evaluated. Samples collected from three surface waters in China were fractionated based on molecular weight and hydrophobicity. The raw water containing more hydrophobic (Ho) fraction exhibited higher formation potentials of haloacetic acid and trihalomethane. The DBPFP of the surface waters did not correlate with the DOC value. The values of DBPFP per DOC were correlated with the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) for Ho and Hi fractions. The obtained results suggested that SUVA cannot reveal the ability of reactive sites to form disinfection byproducts for waters with few aromatic structures. Combined with the analysis of FTIR and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the raw waters and the corresponding fractions, {{it was concluded that}} the Ho fraction with phenolic hydroxyl and conjugated double bonds was responsible for the production of trichloromethanes and trichloroacetic acids.

40|$|The {{previous}} research on the occurrence of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking water has focused on trihalomethane (THMs) formation and evolution, in particular within distribution systems. In this study, the variability of occurrence of haloacetic acids (HAAs) before and after treatment was investigated. The investigation focused on point–to-point fluctuations of HAAs in different treatment stages within the treatment plant. The research was also carried out {{to find out the}} possible sources for the presence of HAAs before chlorination in the raw water. The results showed that the presence of HAAs from the raw water point until the filtered water occurred due to industrial waste and sewages.

However, HAAs level and in particular <b>dichloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> (DCAA) (the preponderant HAAs species in the waters under study), trichloroacetic acids (TCAA) decreased dramatically during filtration, very probably because of the biodegradation within the filter.

Bulk electrolyses were performed at constant current using a BDD anode and an air diffusion cathode able to generate H 2 O 2 in situ, which reacts with added Fe 2 + to yield •OH from Fenton’s reaction. At 300 mA, almost total mineralization was achieved at 420 min for solutions containing 4 mM of either DCA or TCA. Comparative treatments without Fe 2 + (anodic oxidation) or with a Pt anode led to a poorer mineralization.

5|$|The {{biodegradation}} of methoxyflurane begins {{immediately after}} the onset of exposure. The kidney and liver toxicity observed after anesthetic doses is attributable {{to one or more}} metabolites produced by O-demethylation of methoxyflurane. Significant products of this catabolic process include methoxyfluoroacetic acid (MFAA), <b>dichloroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DCAA), and inorganic fluoride. Methoxyflurane nephrotoxicity is dose dependent and irreversible, resulting from O-demethylation of methoxyflurane to fluoride and DCAA. This effect is so predictable and reproducible that methoxyflurane now serves as a pharmacologic model of fluoride-related nephrotoxicity, one with which newer drugs are compared. It is not entirely clear whether the fluoride itself is toxic—it may simply be a surrogate measure for some other toxic metabolite. The concurrent formation of inorganic fluoride and DCAA is unique to methoxyflurane biotransformation compared with other volatile anesthetics, and this combination is more toxic than fluoride alone. This may explain why fluoride formation from methoxyflurane is associated with nephrotoxicity, while fluoride formation from other volatile anesthetics (such as enflurane and sevoflurane) is not. Furthermore, the concurrent use of tetracyclines and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.|$|E

The analysis is characterized by derivatization of HAAs to their methyl-esters with dimethyl sulphate, headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) with a Carboxen–polydimethylsiloxane (CAR-PDMS) fiber and gas chromatography - electron capture detector (GC/ECD). High correlation coefficients were obtained for esters mixture calibration lines and detection limits were found to be at the low ppb level. Repeatability was assessed and coefficients of variation varied from 10 to 20 %. Reproducibility was also evaluated and coefficients of variation from 15 to 25 % were obtained. Analytical results from four Portuguese ISPs showed that the mean concentration of total HAAs (THAAs) in water ranged from 10 ± 2 to 183 ± 28 μg/L in which 55 ± 20 % corresponded to trichloroacetic and <b>dichloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> (TCAA and DCAA). THAAs highest concentrations were directly related to higher ISPs’ water organic matter content. In the lack of European specific regulation for water from ISPs and taking into consideration that ingestion is a form of exposure, THAAs concentration values were compared with drinking water maximum contamination level (MCL) of 60 μg/L proposed by the US EPA for the sum of five HAAs. In 35 % of water sampling campaigns the sum of MBAA (monobromoacetic acid), MCAA (monochloroacetic acid), DCAA and TCAA exceeded that MCL value. The concentrations obtained for THAAs in the ISPs’ atmosphere ranged from 5 ± 1 to 64 ± 10 μg/m 3 (T = 28 ◦C at 5 cm above the water surface) and were proportional to the aerosols’ quantity, which was deeply related to indoor air ventilation system. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

All critical concentration values(calculated by v/v%) were 16 similar to 17 %, {{independent of the}} acdity of solvent. This result {{was similar to that}} of chitosan. Since the protonation of amine with acid is easy even though the acid is weak, the rigidity of chain(therefore the critical concentration) did not depend on acidity of solvents. Critical temperature of butyrul chitosan/DCA system was measured by DSC. The phase diagram was drawn. Critical temperature reached maximum values of 39 degrees C when concentration was 60 % (w/w%). Because butyryl chitosan would degrade in DCA, the enthapy of transition calculated from DSC traces started to decrease at 48 h after the solution was prepared. So the best staying time of solution before DSC determination is 48 h. The dependence of butyrylation degree on critical concentration was studied.

Chloroethanes are particularly ubiquitous {{in the industry}} and in household products, and their entry to the environment may entail potential risks for the living beings. At present, the US Environmental Protection Agency is carrying out the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP), where 1, 2 -dichloroethane (DCA) and 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane (TCA) are considered as priorities for their potential effects on the endocrine system. DCA {{is also found in}} the list of priority substances drawn up by the European Commission. To avoid the release of chloroethanes into the aqueous environment, powerful water treatment technologies such as the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) must be applied in the wastewater treatment facilities. Among them, electrochemical AOPs (EAOPs) such as anodic oxidation (AO) and electro-Fenton (EF) processes have gained much interest for the removal of organic compounds due to their outstanding technical characteristics and the reduced use of expensive chemicals. Here, acidic aqueous solutions of DCA and TCA have been treated by the EF and AO processes. Bulk electrolyses were performed at constant current using a BDD anode and an air diffusion cathode (ADE) able to generate H 2 O 2 in situ, which reacts with added Fe 2 + to yield •OH from Fenton’s reaction. At 300 mA, almost total mineralization was achieved at 420 min for solutions containing 4 mM of either DCA or TCA. Comparative treatments without Fe 2 + (AO) or with a Pt anode led to a poorer mineralization.

40|$|Drinking water {{disinfection}} byproducts (DBP) are {{a group of}} inorganic and organic compounds formed during {{water disinfection}}. Epidemiologic studies suggest an association between rectal, and colon cancer and exposure to DBPs in chlorinated surface water. Therefore, DBPs are a growing public health concern; {{one that has been}} mitigated by multiple regulations of US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) including the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule (Stage 2 DBPR). Tremendous efforts and cost have been spent on controlling DBPs in drinking water; however, human exposure has been poorly characterized. In addition to ingestion exposure, inhalation and dermal absorption during showering for example could also be significant exposure pathways. This dissertation focuses on investigating DBP formation and degradation in heated water (~ 50 oC) in both lab simulated tests and field studies. The first objective of this dissertation was to investigate the temporal variability of regulated DBPs and non-regulated DBPs in cold and hot tap water at a residential home, in a water plant and in a simulated distribution system test. The results showed that the residence time of water in hot water tanks plays an important role on the formation and degradation of DBPs in the hot water plumbing. There was no obvious difference between the concentrations of TCAA (trichloroacetic acid) in long-heated hot tap water and cold tap water. The terminal DBPs for cold and hot tap water were measured and compared to the instantaneous DBP formation in cold and hot tap water. The heating of tap water in the water tank was found to increase the extent of THM formation. The second objective of this dissertation was to investigate the impact of heating scenarios on the formation and degradation of DBPs. A field study involving homes equipped with either tankless heaters or tank heaters was conducted. The concentrations of DBPs were measured for cold and hot tap water of each home. A lab-controlled heating test was later on set up to investigate the formation and degradation of DBPs in short term and long term heating to understand the difference in DBP concentrations in the hot tap water out of different types of water heaters. The results from the field study revealed that the differences in DBP levels in the hot tap water out of the two types of heaters were statistically significant for chlorine residual, total trihalomethanes (TTHMs), <b>dichloroacetic</b> <b>acids</b> (DCAA), dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN), trichloroproprane (TCP) and chloropicrin (CP). Bench scale heating tests showed that long term heating changed the concentrations of DBPs significantly. The third objective of this dissertation was to investigate the thermal formation and degradation in various conditions. Especially, the impact of water age on DBP formation and degradation in cold and heated water was investigated. The results of this study demonstrate that DBP concentration profiles in heated water were quite different from the DBP concentrations in the cold tap water. Chloroform concentrations in the heated water remained constant or even decreased slightly with increasing distribution system water age, despite the fact that its levels always increased with water age in the cold water. The final objective of this dissertation was to propose a method to model chlorine decay, not only in the distribution system, but also applicable to home heating scenarios. A robust two-site chlorine decay model of combined effects of pH, temperature in water distribution system and heating condition was proposed. A single set of readily interpretable parameters were estimated by stochastic search using differential evolution...|$|R

An accurate mass balance of the system revealed that the plants were able to remove and metabolise TCE with an efficiency up to 20 %, depending on the total amount of TCE delivered in the bioreactor. Morphometric data showed that the growth of Z. mays is not significantly affected by the presence of the pollutant up to a concentration of 280 mg/L, while plants show significant alterations at higher TCE concentrations until the growth is completely inhibited for [TCE] ≃ 2000 mg/L.

In {{the first part of this}} thesis the biodiesel production process was studied. One possible route to produce biodiesel from waste oils (carachetrized by high concentrations of Free Fatty Acids, FFAs), is the use of a two steps process: an esterification reaction of FFAs with glycerol and a successive transesterification reaction with methanol of the whole mixture using a basic catalyst. In this thesis the esterification step of FFAs with glycerol, in presence of a new acid heterogeneous catalyst based on sulfonated polymers with enhanced temperature resistance, was studied. The use of this type of catalyst has the advantage of using a relatively high temperature favouring the reaction by stripping of water formed during the esterification The use of an acid catalyst that is able to tranesesterify the glycerides and to esterify the FFAs is onther way to obtained biodiesel from waste or non edible oils. In this thesis the reactions of contemporany esterification of FFAs and tranesterification of glycerides were studied using new homogeneous or supported homogneous Zn(II) catalysts and a NbO 2 /SiO 2 heterogeneous catalyst. The second part of this thesis was devoted to study of new catalysts for chlorination reaction of glycerol recovered from biodiesel production process.

Chlorine dioxide has drawn much recent attention {{as an alternative}} disinfectant and oxidant for drinking water to replace chlorine because of its powerful disinfecting ability and its limited capacity to produce organohalogenated compounds. However, the use of chlorine dioxide leads to chlorite (ClO 2 -) and chlorate (ClO 3 -) as inorganic oxidation by-products which are reported to have toxic effects on humans. The reactions of ClO 2 with simple organic compounds (phenols, aliphatic and aromatic amines [...] .) produce polar compounds such as quinone, ketones, aldehydes and carboxylic acids while oxydation by-products of dissolved organic matter of surface waters (in particular humic substances) are largely unknown. Consequently, {{the aim of this}} work was to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} effects of the use of chlorine dioxide in drinking water treatment To this end, experiments were carried out with dilute aqueous solutions of an isolated aquatic humic acid (Pinail humic acid, PHA) and the objectives of this present study were :- To evaluate the ClO 2 demand and to determine the productions of chlorite, chlorate and of organohalogenated compounds such as trihalomethanes (THMs), <b>dichloroacetic</b> and trichloroacetic <b>acids</b> (DCA, TCA) which are the main organohalogenated products formed by chlorination. - To show the effects of chlorine dioxide preoxidation on organic halide formation potentials (postchlorination) and on the removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by activated carbon. In addition, reactions of chlorite with chlorine or with activated carbon were also examined. EXPERIMENTALPniail humic acid was dissolved in phosphate buffered ultra-pure water (pH = 7. 5). Oxidation and adsorption experiments were carried out in headspace-free bottles, at 20 ± 1 °C and in the dark. Stock solutions of chlorine dioxide (4 - 6 g l- 1) and of chlorine (6 - 10 g l- 1) were prepared in the laboratory and titrated by iodometry. Residual chlorine dioxide concentration in PHA solutions was determined by spectrophotometric measurement at 360 nm and by two colorimetric methods : the chlorophenol red and the ACVK methods. Concentrations of DOC and of total organic chlorine or halogen (TOCI, TOX) were measured using a DOHRMANN DC 80 carbon analyser and a DOHRMANN DX 20 A TOX analyser equipped with a microcoulometric cell, respectively. THMs, DCA and TCA were determined by a gas chromatograph equipped with a 63 Ni electron capture detector after extraction by pentane for the THMs, and methylation in ether phase for DCA and TCA. Inorganic chlorine species were analysed by HPLC with a UV detector (ClO 2 -) or by chromatography (Cl-, ClO 3 -). RESULTS• Oxidation of PHA by ClO 2 The results showed that PHA consumed about 2 mg of ClO 2 /mg of DOC after a reaction time of 24 hours (fig. 1) and that there is a rapid consumption of ClO 2 during the first 30 minutes of the reaction (fig. 2) Oxidation by ClO 2 had no effect on DOC concentration (DOC removal : < 10 %) and led to a significant decrease (about 30 %) of the UV-absorbance at 254 or 270 nm (fig. 1 and 2), and to productions of ClO 2 - (0, 65 mg of ClO 2 -/mg of ClO 2 consumed) which were independant of the applied oxidant dose and of the reaction time. Furthermore, after a 72 hour reaction time in the dark, chlorine dioxide ([ClO 2] 0 = 5 mg l- 1, [PHA] 0 = 5 mg l- 1, DOC = 2, 6 mg l- 1) produces very small amounts of chloroform (< 5 µg l- 1), DCA (5 µg l- 1) and TCA (5 µg l- 1) and organochlorinated compounds (TOCl : 36 µg/mg DOC) compared to chlorine oxidation (tableau 1). However, in the presence of sunlight, ClO 2 is rapidly photodecomposed (fig. 3) and the photodegradation products of ClO 2 allow bromide oxidation (fig. 11) and lead to higher productions of organohalogenated compounds such as THMs (fig. 4). • Chlorine dioxide preoxidation followed by chlorinationAs shown in figure 5, chlorine dioxide preoxidation reduces the production of organohalogenated compounds and the chlorine demand during postchlorination. For a preoxidant dose corresponding to the ClO 2 demand of PHA, the decrease in the formation potentials of CHCl 3, DCA, TCA and TOCl was about 40 - 50 %. These results confirm the similarity of the action of chlorine dioxide and chlorine on aromatic structures which have high electron density carbons and which constitute probably the most reactive precursors of organohalogenated by-products. As far as chlorite concentration is concerned, the results showed that chlorite formed during the preoxidation step was completely oxidized to chlorate during postchlorination, under the experimental conditions used in this study (chlorine dose : 40 mg l- 1; contact time : 24 or 72 hours). Because of the reactions of chlorine eh chlorine and with residual chlorine dioxide, a small increase in the chlorine demand was observed when PHA solutions were heavily preoxidized (fig. 5). • Chlorine dioxide preoxidation followed by activated carbon treatmentBatch experiments were carried out with a powdered activated carbon (PAC, granulometry : < 80 µm) which was obtained by crushing a commercial granular activated carbon (CECA 40, 12 x 40 mesh). Once equilibrium was achieved (contact time : 10 days), adsorption isotherms indicated that chlorine dioxide preoxidation increases the absorbability of DOC on activated carbon (fig; 4 tableau 2). Furthermore, chlorite in oxidized PHA solutions was reduced by PAC to chloride. The capacity of CECA 40 activated carbon for ClO 2 - reduction to Cl- was about 170 mg ClO 2 -/g of PAC (fig. 7). Other experiments showed that chlorite may react with specific surface groups on PAC to produce inorganic carbon (fig. 7) and with PHA only in the presence of PAC as shown the DOC and UV-absorbance curves in figure 8 and the increase of TOX concentration in the liquid phase in figure 9. Thus the observed increase in DOC absorbability on PAC after a chlorine dioxide preoxidation may be attributed to cheminal interactions between PAC, chlorite, residual chlorine dioxide and adsorbed organic matter and requires further study...|$|R
50|$|The DMT {{group is}} removed with a {{solution}} of an acid, such as 2% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or 3% <b>dichloroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DCA), in an inert solvent (dichloromethane or toluene). The orange-colored DMT cation formed is washed out; the step results in the solid support-bound oligonucleotide precursor bearing a free 5'-terminal hydroxyl group.It is worth remembering that conducting detritylation for an extended time or with stronger than recommended solutions of acids leads to depurination of solid support-bound oligonucleotide and thus reduces the yield of the desired full-length product.|$|E
50|$|Haloacetic acids are {{carboxylic}} {{acids in}} which a halogen atom {{takes the place of}} a hydrogen atom in acetic acid. Thus, in a monohaloacetic acid, a single halogen would replace a hydrogen atom. For example, chloroacetic acid would have the structural formula CH2ClCO2H. In the same manner, in <b>dichloroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> two chlorine atoms would take the place of two hydrogen atoms (CHCl2CO2H). The inductive effect caused by the electronegative halogens often result in the higher acidity of these compounds by stabilising the negative charge of the conjugate base.|$|E

50|$|As {{the primary}} {{regulators}} of a crucial {{step in the}} central metabolic pathway, the pyruvate dehydrogenase family is tightly regulated itself by a myriad of factors. PDK activity {{has been shown to}} decrease in individuals consuming a diet that is high in n-3 fatty acids; however, PDH activity remained unaffected. Additionally, PDK1 is inihibited by AZD7545 and dichloroacetic acid; the mechanism was discovered to be the trifluoromethylpropanamide end of AZD7545 projecting into the lipoyl-binding pocket of PDK1. <b>Dichloroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> was found near the helix bundle in the N-terminal domain of PDK1. Bound DCA promotes local conformational changes that are communicated to both nucleotide-binding and lipoyl-binding pockets of PDK1, leading to the inactivation of kinase activity.|$|E
5000|$|GSTZ1 is {{predominantly}} found in liver cells; more specifically, it is localized {{in both the}} cytosol and the mitochondria. GSTZ1 is essentially known for catalyzing glutathione-dependent isomerization of maleylacetoacetate to fumarylacetoacetate, which is the second-to-last step in the vital phenylalanine and tyrosine degradation pathway. It is the only enzyme in the GST family that catalyses a significant process in intermediary metabolism and it ensures that this enzyme {{can be found in}} a variety of species from humans to bacteria. [...] Another function of the GSTZ1 is that it is in control of the biotransformation of alpha-haloacids, like <b>dichloroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DCA), to glyoxylic acid. This prevents the buildup of DCA, which can lead to asymptomatic hepatotoxicity and a reversible peripheral neuropathy. Both functions for this enzyme requires the presence of glutathione (GSH) in order to work.|$|E
50|$|The {{biodegradation}} of methoxyflurane produces {{inorganic fluoride}} and <b>dichloroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DCAA). The combined {{effects of these}} two compounds {{may be responsible for}} the toxicity of methoxyflurane to some of the major organs of the human body. Methoxyflurane was determined to be nephrotoxic (damaging to the kidneys) in a dose-dependent response and hepatotoxic (damaging to the liver) at anesthetic doses in 1973, and the drug was abandoned as a general anesthetic in the late 1970s. In 1999, the manufacturer discontinued distribution of methoxyflurane in the United States and Canada, and on September 6, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration determined that it should be withdrawn from the market for safety concerns. It is however still used in Australia as an emergency analgesic for the initial management of pain due to acute trauma, as well as for brief painful procedures such as changing of wound dressings or for transport of injured people.|$|E
50|$|The {{biodegradation}} of methoxyflurane begins {{immediately after}} the onset of exposure. The kidney and liver toxicity observed after anesthetic doses is attributable {{to one or more}} metabolites produced by O-demethylation of methoxyflurane. Significant products of this catabolic process include methoxyfluoroacetic acid (MFAA), <b>dichloroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DCAA), and inorganic fluoride. Methoxyflurane nephrotoxicity is dose dependent and irreversible, resulting from O-demethylation of methoxyflurane to fluoride and DCAA. This effect is so predictable and reproducible that methoxyflurane now serves as a pharmacologic model of fluoride-related nephrotoxicity, one with which newer drugs are compared. It is not entirely clear whether the fluoride itself is toxic—it may simply be a surrogate measure for some other toxic metabolite. The concurrent formation of inorganic fluoride and DCAA is unique to methoxyflurane biotransformation compared with other volatile anesthetics, and this combination is more toxic than fluoride alone. This may explain why fluoride formation from methoxyflurane is associated with nephrotoxicity, while fluoride formation from other volatile anesthetics (such as enflurane and sevoflurane) is not. Furthermore, the concurrent use of tetracyclines and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.|$|E
50|$|The {{ubiquitous}} role of {{this gene}} {{lends itself to}} being involved {{in a variety of}} disease pathologies, including cancer. PDK1 mRNA expression is significantly associated with tumor progression; in fact, the presence of PDK1 can serve as a prognostic marker, indicating the level of success a patient can achieve. Specifically, this may serve as a biomarker in patients with gastric cancer. In coordination, the inhibitor <b>dichloroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> may be used in the future as a treatment option for patients with this type of cancer. PDK1, as it regulates hypoxia and lactate production, is associated with a poor outcome in patients with head and neck squamous cancer. The buildup of glycolytic metabolites may promote Hypoxia-Inducing Factor (HIF) activation, which creates a feed-forward loop for malignancy progression. As such, using HIF-1 as a metabolite to regulate PDK1 is seen as another potential therapy, either on its own or in tandem with other therapies, for this type of cancer. In a further developed study, combined PDK1 and CHK1 inhibition was shown to be required to kill glioblastoma stem-like cells in vitro and in vivo.|$|E
