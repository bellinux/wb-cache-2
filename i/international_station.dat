5|$|On 14 November 1994, Eurostar {{services}} began between Waterloo <b>International</b> <b>station</b> in London, Gare du Nord in Paris and Brussels-South {{railway station}} in Brussels.|$|E
5|$|On 4 September 2007 a record-breaking train left Paris Gare du Nord at 10:44 (09:44 BST) {{and reached}} London St Pancras in 2hours 3minutes 39 seconds; {{carrying}} journalists and railway workers.

5|$|It {{was built}} in two stages. The first section between the tunnel and Fawkham Junction in north Kent opened in September 2003, cutting London–Paris journey times by 21minutes to 2hours 35minutes, and London–Brussels to 2hours 20minutes. On 14 November 2007, {{commercial}} services began over {{the whole of the}} new HS1 line. The redeveloped St Pancras <b>International</b> <b>station</b> became the new London terminus for all Eurostar services.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{transfer}} of Eurostar services from Waterloo, the former Eurostar platforms 20–24 of Waterloo International have remained unused. Waterloo suffers significant capacity problems, and proposals {{have been put in}} place to convert the former <b>international</b> <b>station</b> to domestic use. In December 2008 preparatory work was carried out to enable platform 20 to be used by South West Trains suburban services. However, the conversion of the remaining platforms was delayed as it would require alterations to the track layout outside the station.|$|E
5|$|The town is {{predicted}} to grow by around 30percent under the Milton Keynes South Midlands (MKSM) study, as the British government has identified Wellingborough as one of several towns in Northamptonshire where growth will be directed over the next 30years. The study allocates 12,800 additional homes mainly {{to the east of}} the town. The town has also a growing commuter population as it is located on the Midland Main Line railway, operated by , which has InterCity trains to London St Pancras <b>International</b> <b>station</b> taking under an hour, giving an interchange with Eurostar services.|$|E

5|$|Eurostar's {{passenger}} numbers initially {{failed to}} meet predictions. In 1996, London and Continental Railways forecast that passenger numbers would reach 21.4million annually by 2004, but only 7.3million was achieved. 82 million passengers used Waterloo <b>International</b> <b>Station</b> from its opening in 1994 to its closure in 2007. 2008 was a record year for Eurostar, with a 10.3% rise in passenger use, which was attributed {{to the use of}} High Speed 1 and the move to St Pancras. The following year, Eurostar saw an 11.5% fall in passenger numbers during {{the first three months of}} 2009, attributed to the 2008 Channel Tunnel fire and the 2009 recession.|$|E
25|$|During the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, St Pancras was the Central London {{terminus}} of the Olympic Javelin service, a seven-minute shuttle between Central London and Stratford <b>International</b> <b>station</b> for the London Olympic Park.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s {{part of the}} Stratford Works {{site was}} {{converted}} to the London International Freight Terminal (LIFT) which opened in 1967 {{and there was a}} freight liner terminal that operated {{on the far side of}} the Stratford railway complex (on the Channelsea Loop line) between 1967 and 1994. The former site is now occupied by the <b>international</b> <b>station</b> and shopping centre.|$|E

25|$|With {{the great}} {{increase}} in services and passengers since the Second World War, Stratford {{has changed from}} a fairly busy junction into one of Britain's major rail interchanges. Growth is set {{to continue in the}} future {{with the opening of the}} Crossrail line across London and the stopping of international services at nearby Stratford <b>International</b> <b>station</b> (in 2014 this is only served by domestic services).|$|E

25|$|The nearby Stratford <b>International</b> <b>station</b> {{opened on}} 30 November 2009 (for preview {{services}} only). Since 13 December 2009 Southeastern began its full domestic high-speed service between London St Pancras, directly to Ebbsfleet International and Ashford in Kent. The Docklands Light Railway 'Stratford International' extension {{has provided a}} link between the two stations since 31 August 2011. There is also a walking route between the two stations passing through the newly built Westfield Stratford City Shopping Centre.|$|E

25|$|Being both on {{the river}} and close to London, Thurrock is served with good {{communication}} links. The M25 London Orbital Motorway, the railway line between Southend and London Fenchurch Street which provides direct access to Central London and, eventually, Stratford <b>International</b> <b>Station,</b> the Port of Tilbury and the nearby London City Airport make Thurrock an important international trade centre. There is a grass airstrip south of Bulphan village. A ferry for passengers on foot connects Tilbury with Gravesend on the southern bank of the River Thames.|$|E
25|$|Until summer 2018 {{there will}} be major track, {{signalling}} and station remodelling works at London Bridge station {{as part of the}} Masterplan project (some works within the station building started during Key Output 1). A grade-separated junction is being created at Bermondsey. New permanent way (track level, in this case including both plain rail and junctions) and overhead line equipment will be laid out in the new Canal Tunnels just north of St Pancras between the Thameslink route and the East Coast Main Line, thereby opening up the Thameslink network to new destinations north of London. An overhead conductor rail replaced the traditional Mk3b solid wire between the former King's Cross Thameslink station to St Pancras <b>International</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E

25|$|To this day, {{rolling stock}} exchanges {{require the use}} of road vehicles. Before the {{construction}} of Waterloo International terminal in 1990, the vehicles were hoisted individually by the Armstrong Lift outside the north wall of Waterloo main line station. The procedure is now carried out using a road-mounted crane in a shaft adjacent to the depot, south of Waterloo main line station on Spur Road. This is only necessary for major maintenance work that requires lifting of the car body, as the Waterloo depot is fully equipped for routine maintenance work. The remaining stub of the siding tunnel that led to the Armstrong Lift can still be seen on the left-hand side of the train shortly after leaving Waterloo for Bank, but the lift itself was buried (along with the entire Western sidings) in 1992 as part of the construction of Waterloo <b>International</b> <b>station,</b> the terminal for Eurostar trains.|$|E
