In this article, the author reviews the evidence for this model, considers alternative accounts, and proposes a simple and empirically motivated revision to the model that (a) accommodates conflicting results, (b) provides a novel account of the ties effect, and (c) makes new and nonintuitive predictions for the <b>factoring</b> <b>operation</b> (e. g., factoring of 28 into 4 and 7). The author reports 3 experiments designed to test these predictions and discusses implications for arithmetic instruction. There is general agreement in the cognitive literature that adult performance on single-digit multiplication and division problems (e. g., 4 7 and 28 / 7) primarily involves fact recall (for reviews, see Ashcraft, 1992, 1995), although other strategies are sometimes used (e. g., LeFevre & Morris, 1999).

40|$|Let G = (V,E) be an {{undirected graph}} whose edges may fail, and let G, denote G {{with a set}} K V specified. Edge {{failures}} {{are assumed to be}} statistically independent and to have known probabilities. The K-terminal reliability of G,, denoted R(G,), is the probability that all vertices in K are connected by working edges. Computing K-terminal reliability is an NP-hard problem not known to be in NP. A factoring algorithm for computing network reliability recursively applies the formula R(G,) = p,R(G,,*e,) + q,R(G,- e,), where Gxr*e, is G, with edge e, contracted, G, - e, is G, with e, deleted and p, = I- q, is the reliability of edge e,. Various reliability-preserving reductions may be performed after each <b>factoring</b> <b>operation</b> in order to reduce computational complexity. The complexity of a slightly restricted factoring algorithm using standard reductions, along with newly developed polygon-to-chain reductions, will be bounded below by an invariant of G, the “minimum domination. ” For 2 5 (KI 5 5 or IVI- 2 5 IKI 5 IVI, this bound is always achievable. The factoring algorithm with polygon-to-chain reductions will always perform as well as or better than an algorithm using only standard reductions, and for some networks, it will outperform the simpler algorithm by an exponential factor. This generalizes early results that were only valid for K = V. Removing the restriction on edge selection leaves results essentially unchanged in the upper range of IK(, but minimum domination becomes only a tight upper bound for the lower range. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} the {{implementation}} of a simple yet high performance digital current mode controller that achieves high power <b>factor</b> <b>operation</b> for three phase boost rectifier is described. The indicated objective is achieved without input voltage sensing and without transformation of the control variables into rotating reference frame. The controller uses the concept of resistance emulation for shaping of input current like input voltage in digital implementation. Two decoupled fixed frequency current mode controllers calculate the switching instants for equivalent single phase boost rectifiers. A combined switching strategy is developed in the form of space vectors to simultaneously satisfy the timing requirements of both the current mode controllers in a switching period. Conventional phase locked loop (PLL) is not required as converter switching is self-synchronized with the input voltage. Analytical formula is derived to obtain the steady state stability condition of the converter. A linear, low frequency, small signal model of the three phase boost rectifier is developed and verified by measurement of the voltage control transfer function. In implementation Texas Instruments’s DSP TMS 320 F 240 F is used as the digital controller. The algorithm is tested on a 10 -kW, 700 -V dc, three phase boost rectifier.
