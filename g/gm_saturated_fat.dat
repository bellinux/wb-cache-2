2500|$|Consuming {{large amounts}} of <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> can {{negatively}} affect your brain. [...] Eating foods with <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> elevates the level of cholesterol and triglycerides in your body. [...] Studies have shown that high levels of triglycerides strongly link with mood problems such as depression, hostility and aggression. [...] This may occur because high triglyceride levels decrease the amount of oxygen that blood can carry to your brain. The American Heart Association recommends that you consume no more than 16g of <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> daily. [...] Common sources of <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> are meat and dairy products.|$|R

2500|$|Blanket {{recommendations}} to lower <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> were criticized at a 2010 conference debate of the American Dietetic Association for focusing too narrowly on reducing <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> rather than emphasizing increased consumption of healthy fats and unrefined carbohydrates.

40|$|A {{focus of}} dietary {{recommendations}} for cardiovascular disease (CVD) {{prevention and treatment}} has been a reduction in <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake, primarily {{as a means of}} lowering LDL-cholesterol concentrations. However, the evidence that supports a reduction in <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake must be evaluated in the context of replacement by other macronutrients. Clinical trials that replaced <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> with polyunsaturated fat have generally shown a reduction in CVD events, although several studies showed no effects. An independent association of <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake with CVD risk has not been consistently shown in prospective epidemiologic studies, although some have provided evidence of an increased risk in young individuals and in women. Replacement of <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> by polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat lowers both LDL and HDL cholesterol. However, replacement with a higher carbohydrate intake, particularly refined carbohydrate, can exacerbate the atherogenic dyslipidemia associated with insulin resistance and obesity that includes increased triglycerides, small LDL particles, and reduced HDL cholesterol. In summary, although substitution of dietary polyunsaturated <b>fat</b> for <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> has been shown to lower CVD risk, there are few epidemiologic or clinical trial data to support a benefit of replacing <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> with carbohydrate. Furthermore, particularly given the differential effects of dietary <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> and carbohydrates on concentrations of larger and smaller LDL particles, respectively, dietary efforts to improve the increasing burden of CVD risk associated with atherogenic dyslipidemia should primarily emphasize the limitation of refined carbohydrate intakes and a reduction in excess adiposity...|$|R

Sixteen adults with metabolic syndrome (age 44. 9 ¡ 9. 9 yr, BMI 37. 9 ¡ 6. 3 kg/m 2) were fed six 3 -wk diets that progressively increased carbohydrate (from 47 to 346 g/day) with concomitant decreases in total and <b>saturated</b> <b>fat.</b> Despite a distinct increase in <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake from baseline to the low-carbohydrate diet (46 to 84 g/day), and then a gradual decrease in <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> to 32 g/day at the highest carbohydrate phase, {{there were no significant}} changes in the proportion of total SFA in any plasma lipid fractions.

METHODS: Adipose tissue and total hepatic fat were higher in the <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> group than in the hydrogenated fat group. Hepatic lipid peroxidation was greatest in the <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> group, with consequent lower hepatic vitamin E and A levels. In contrast, serum vitamin A was highest in the <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> group. Analysis of hepatic lipid fractions found more cholesterol and less high density lipoprotein-cholesterol in the hydrogenated fat group. The hydrogenated fat group had the highest levels of triacylglycerols, followed by the <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> group. RESULTS: Significant amounts of trans fatty acids were detected in the hepatic and adipose tissues of the hydrogenated fat group. Among the identified fatty acids, 18 : 1 n 9 had a higher positive association with hepatic cholesterol and triacylglycerols, and a higher negative association with high density lipoprotein-cholesterol.

Recently, we found that replacement of <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> by trans fat in a dietary controlled study with 32 men and women decreased serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -cholesterol and impaired endothelial function, suggesting that trans fats have stronger adverse effects than <b>saturated</b> <b>fats.</b> To investigate this further, we measured the activity of serum paraoxonase (PON 1) in serum samples of the same volunteers after consumption of both diets.

Separable fat is the greatest determinant of the <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> in Australian red meat, and changes in processing and butchering practices have combined to produce red meat today with significantly lower <b>saturated</b> <b>fat.</b> Nutrient analyses in 2002 showed that the separable fat on raw retail samples was up to 38 % less than in comparable cuts in 1983.
