2500|$|Today {{there are}} {{multiple}} sources for detailed guidelines and tips on food and wine pairing. But many wine drinkers select wine pairings based on instinct, {{the mood of the}} meal or simply a desire to drink a particular wine at the moment they desire to eat a particular meal. The subjective nature of taste makes it possible to drink any kind of wine with any kind of food and have an enjoyable experience. Wine expert Mark Oldman has noted [...] "Food and Wine pairing can be like sex and pizza: even when it's bad, it can still be pretty good" [...] and gives the example of wedding cake with a <b>dry</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine.</b> A very dry wine with a very sweet food is, according to Oldman, [...] "the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard" [...] and is not a [...] "good pairing" [...] according to most guidelines but the atmosphere of the occasion and the subjective nature of taste can trump any rule or guideline. Today, many wine experts and advocates in the realm of food and wine pairing try to focus on the more objective physical aspects of food that {{have an effect on the}} palate, altering (or enhancing) the perception of various aspects of the wine.|$|E
2500|$|Cava is {{the name}} of a type of Spanish (mostly in Catalonia but also in other regions such as Valencia, La Rioja, Aragon, Extremadura) white or pink {{sparkling}} wine produced mainly in the Penedès region in Catalonia, 40km to the south west of Barcelona, with the méthode champenoise but grape varieties different from grapes used in Champagne making. Cava is a Greek term that was used to refer to a [...] "high end" [...] table wine or wine cellar, and comes from the Latin word [...] "cava" [...] which means cave in English. Caves were used {{in the early days of}} Cava production for the preservation or aging of wine. Today Cavas have become integrated with Catalan and also Spanish family traditions and is often consumed at any kind of celebrations (baptism, marriages, banquets, dinners and parties). The sparkling wine of Cava was created in 1872 by Josep Raventós. The vineyards of Penedès were devastated by the phylloxera plague, and the predominantly red vines were being replaced by large numbers of vines producing white grapes. After seeing the success of the Champagne region, Raventós decided to create the <b>dry</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> that has become the reason for the region's continued success. In the past the wine was referred to as Spanish Champagne (no longer permitted under EU law), or colloquially as champaña in Spanish or xampany in Catalan.|$|E
25|$|Canada's <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> {{producers}} {{are found in}} Southern Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec and Nova Scotia, where growing conditions mirror that of Champagne, Provence and Languedoc of France. In particular, Ontario's appellations are emerging as strong producers of <b>dry</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> as their cooler climate conditions are very conducive to producing excellent, flavourful and not-too-ripe grapes.|$|R
50|$|When {{used for}} <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine,</b> the term trocken {{actually}} means 17 to 35 grams per liter of sugar. This parallels the term sec ("dry") in French, which indicates a <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> {{of the same}} sugar level as trocken. Drier wines are designated extra trocken at 12 to 20 grams of sugar per liter, while completely <b>dry</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> are given the designation brut (0-15 grams per liter) or extra brut (0-6 grams per liter).|$|R
50|$|Verdea {{is a white}} Italian {{wine grape}} variety that {{originated}} in Tuscany but is today mainly grown in the Lombardy wine region of northern Italy. The grape is sometimes confused with the white Verdeca grape of the Apulia region and the French wine grape Verdesse from Savoy due to similarities in their names and synonyms. Verdea {{can be used to}} make a wide variety of wines, ranging from the late harvested Vin Santo to <b>dry</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Prosecco is a <b>dry</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine.</b> It is {{made from}} a variety of white grape of the same name, which is {{traditionally}} grown in an area near Conegliano and Valdobbiadene, in the hills north of Treviso. The name of Prosecco is derived from the northern Italian village of Prosecco (Trieste), where this grape variety is believed to have originated.|$|E
50|$|An {{emerging}} {{category of}} sparkling wine in Ontario is sparkling ice wine, which was first crafted accidentally by Canadian wine writer Konrad Ejbich {{in his home}} cellar in the Niagara Peninsula.

50|$|Vouvray {{is another}} Chenin blanc {{appellation}} which produces both sweet, <b>dry</b> and <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines.</b> It is situated further upriver along the Loire, in the Touraine subregion. In comparison to sweet Vouvray, Coteaux du Layon wines {{tend to be}} more full-bodied, often sweeter, and slightly lower in acidity.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{overwhelmingly}} mountainous {{nature of}} the territory, agriculture remains important. Farms often join together to form larger cooperatives. The most important produce comprises: apples (50% of national production, together with South Tyrol) and other fruit, vegetables (primarily in the Val di Gresta) and grape; important especially for its quality, the latter {{is used for the}} production of <b>dry</b> and <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> {{are served}} in {{particular}} glasses {{such as the}} flute and the coupe. The flute is the preferred glass for professional tasters: the shape concentrates the aromas to {{the nose of the}} taster and its height allows appreciation of the fine bubbles that rise to the surface. The coupe is not recommended because of its too flared shape: it does not preserve the layer of foam and the gas and aromas escape too fast. According to legend, this type of glass was developed based on the shape of the Breast of the Marquise de Pompadour. The coupe dates from a time when the wines were mostly sweeter and less aromatic. Since the 1930s and with the habit to consume <b>drier</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines,</b> the flute has taken the place of the coupe. The coupe is also used in mixtures which have an olive in a bubbly cocktail and in the spectacular pyramids of glasses that crown festivities.|$|R
5000|$|Valdobbiadene (...) {{is a town}} in the {{province}} of Treviso, Veneto, Italy. Valdobbiadene is a wine growing area. Just below the Alpine-Dolomite areas of Veneto, it provides a climate for a cool variety of grape (Glera). The Conegliano Valdobbiadene area is the home of the best Prosecco, an extra <b>dry</b> <b>sparkling</b> white <b>wine.</b> Prosecco brands that derive from this area include Altaneve, Mionetto, Masottina, and others.|$|R
25|$|For an aperitif, {{flavoured}} <b>dry</b> <b>wine</b> or <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> {{goes with}} all meals.

50|$|Crémant de Die {{from the}} same area and same {{producers}} is a prestige <b>dry,</b> natural <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> of apple and green fruit flavours and fragrance and is vinified by the traditional Champagne method of a first fermentation in the vat followed by a second fermentation in the bottle. Originally produced from 100% Clairette, Aligoté and Muscat are now included. It is usually drunk as an aperitif but it can equally accompany a meal.|$|R
5000|$|The Center region {{consists}} of areas in Querétaro, Zacatecas and Aguascalientes. Most vineyards are found {{at an altitude}} of 6500 ft, and most of the wine produced here is of the sparkling variety. However, other types such as Sauvignon blanc, St. Emilion, Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot noir can be found as well. The best-known vintner here is the Mexican operation of Spain’s Freixenet winery. This label is known for <b>dry</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> called “vinos espumosos” (foamy wines), which come in satiny black bottles and based on Dom Pérignon’s champagne fermentation methods. Some still red wines are also produced. Another major producer is Companía Vinícola Los Eucaliptos in the town of Ezequiel Montes. A locally known label is Vinos Hidalgo La Madrileña in the San Juan del Río region. [...] Los Azteca Hacienda Mexicana dates back to the 18th century which recently became a winery. Another vintner called La Ronda specializes in growing grapes to make Kosher wine sold in certain markets in Mexico City.|$|R
50|$|Coteaux de Die - A still (non <b>sparkling)</b> <b>dry</b> white <b>wine</b> {{produced}} from 100% clairette that was accorded an AOC in 1993. The low annual production is about 144 hectolitres. Characterised by green tints, {{it is usually}} drunk chilled and can accompany seafood.|$|R
50|$|The Mornington Peninsula is an Australian wine region located {{south of}} Melbourne, Victoria. The region has a cool climate making wine growing ideal {{and focuses on}} Pinot noir {{production}} but has had success with other varietals including Chardonnay, Pinot gris and Tempranillo. The region {{is known for its}} medium bodied, <b>dry</b> <b>wines</b> and <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> that show structure and complexity. The still wine versions of Chardonnay reflect a diversity of styles, all typically oaked, from more citrus to more tropical fruit flavors.|$|R
25|$|The Isonzo and Carso wine {{regions are}} located in the far southeastern part of Friuli-Venezia Giulia {{bordering}} Slovenia. The Isonzo region is located on a plain of alluvial deposits directly south of Collio along the Isonzo river. The best vineyards {{are located in}} the northeast, close to Cormons. The wine regions predominately have a maritime climate with more rainfall than other Friuli regions. The region is known for its sparkling Pinot bianco as well as dry white wines made from Chardonnay, Malvasia Istriana and Sauvignon blanc. Other Isonzo DOC designated wines include dry, off <b>dry</b> and <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> made from Gewürztraminer, Cabernet franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Franconia, Moscato Giallo, Moscato Rosa, Pinot grigio, Pinot nero, Refosco, Riesling, Schioppettino, Friulano, Verduzzo and Welschriesling.

25|$|Chenin blanc is the {{dominant}} and nearly exclusive grape of Vouvray. While the obscure minor grape Arbois is permitted in the Vouvray AOC, it is rarely seen. With more 5,000 acres (2,000 hectares) of vineyards planted as of 2006, it is the single largest producer of Chenin blanc-based wines in France by a sizable margin, with only the Anjou wine region of the Coteaux du Layon coming close. Most of the vineyards are planted on a plateau with a southern aspect facing towards the river. Viticulture and wine production {{in the region is}} dictated almost completely by the climate characteristics of a particular vintage with cooler climate years shifting productions towards <b>dry</b> and <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> while warmer vintages seeing increased production of sweet and even botrytized wines. The harvest in Vouvray is often the last in France to be completed, potentially lasting until November. When sweet and botrytized wine are being produced, the harvest is often very labor-intensive, involving successive tries or passages through the vineyards with harvesters hand-picking only the ripest berries.|$|R
50|$|Champagne (<b>sparkling</b> <b>wine)</b> {{types of}} the factory include semi <b>dry</b> {{champagne}}, red <b>sparkling</b> champagne, <b>dry</b> champagne and semisweet champagne, all being produced under the brand Armenian Champagne.|$|R
50|$|The commune of Gravina in Puglia {{produces}} a white Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) Italian wine {{that can be}} made in a still or sparkling Spumante style. While the still Gravina wine is almost always <b>dry,</b> the <b>sparkling</b> Gravina <b>wine</b> can be made in both a dry secco and slightly sweet amabile style. All grapes destined for DOC wine production need to be harvested to a yield no greater than 15 tonnes/ha. The wine is made primarily (40-65%) from Malvasia del Chianti, Greco di Tufo and Bianco d'Alessano with the last two grape varieties collectively permitted to make up between 35-60% of the blend. Bombino bianco, Trebbiano Toscano and Verdeca are also permitted up to a maximum of 10%. The finished wine must attain a minimum alcohol level of 11% in order to be labelled with the Gravina DOC designation.|$|R

40|$|The foaming {{properties}} in <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> are {{an indicator of}} quality {{as it is the}} first quality perception consumers have upon opening a bottle of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine.</b> Proteins, which are derived from both grapes and yeast during <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> production, are known to impact the foaming {{properties in}} finished <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines.</b> The objectives of this project were to (1) understand the role and relationship that proteins have on the overall foaming properties and overall quality in <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine,</b> (2) determine the role different yeast and grape clones from different varietals have on <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> quality and (3) understand how bentonite affects <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> quality. The protein concentration in <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> produced from Mariafeld Pinot noir appeared to impact the foaming properties. The longest elapsed time for foam dissipation was observed in the control treatment where bentonite was not used to strip protein and the shortest time was observed in the treatment where bentonite was used to remove grape and yeast proteins. In Riesling <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines,</b> the largest protein concentrations were observed in non-bentonite treated juices while the lowest were observed in the bentonite treatments. The prevalence of foam observed in both bentonite treatments, where grape proteins were completely removed, indicated that proteins derived over the course of secondary fermentation were foam forming in Riesling <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine.</b> It was also observed that different yeast, varietals, clones and soil compositions may impact the protein concentrations, chemical compositions and overall quality of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine.</b> The results of this research aim to better understand <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> quality to optimize production in the Niagara Peninsula...|$|R
40|$|Use of alginate-immobilized yeasts in the {{production}} of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> using the "champenois" method was investigated.
