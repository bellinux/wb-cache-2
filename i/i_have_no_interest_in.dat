25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E
25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I {{should go to}} the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. But notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell us what is necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what will make us happy or how to achieve the things that will make us happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E
500|$|Tippett had {{intended}} The Ice Break {{to be his}} final opera, but in 1985 he began work on New Year. [...] Bowen saw this work as a summary of ideas and images that had attracted Tippett throughout his working life. Donal Henahan was dismissive of the music: [...] "...the score generally natters along in the numbing, not-quite-atonal but antimelodic style familiar from other Tippett works." [...] In Byzantium (1990), Tippett set the five stanzas of W. B. Yeats's poem, with added orchestral interludes. By {{this time he was}} professing little interest in his own work beyond its creation; performance and reception had become irrelevant to him. In 1996 he told an interviewer: [...] "I'm outside the music I've made, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> it". After the String Quartet No. 5 (1991), which connects thematically with earlier works, Tippett closed his main output with The Rose Lake (1993), described in Tippett's Daily Telegraph obituary as [...] "of luminous beauty... a worthy ending to a remarkable career." ...|$|E

500|$|Stone Temple Pilots {{stressed}} {{that a new}} album would be recorded as long as both parties in the lawsuit acted in good faith, but in November 2008, Weiland would comment, [...] "I was told, and I was told for years, that we were free from Atlantic.... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> making a record for a major label." [...] Weiland expressed interest in exploring distribution options after the band's reformation. Commenting on his idea, he said, [...] "ther bands, they make more money doing things in an unconventional fashion as opposed to doing it... with the major labels." [...] Dean was curious about Weiland's idea but was aware that the band was contractually obligated to release two more albums. Increasing the uncertainty {{in the future of}} a new album, Weiland added, [...] "I'm proud of everything we've written. But to make another record would mean another couple of years of my life dedicated to that, and I just don't know if that's where I see myself going." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 30 May 2010, Modrić {{was awarded}} with a new six-year {{contract}} that ran until 2016; he said, [...] "Tottenham Hotspur gave me my chance in the Premier League and I {{want to go on}} to achieve great success here with them. Yes, there have been enquiries from other big clubs, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> going anywhere. Last season's top-four finish was an indication of where we are as a Club and I feel I can continue to improve and go on to achieve everything I want to at Spurs".|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} for Screen Crush, Kevin Fitzpatrick stated, [...] "The honest {{truth is that}} Iron Fist needed {{to be so much}} weirder than it {{actually}} is, akin to how Doctor Strange essentially re-told the Iron Man story with enough out-there visuals and eccentric supporting characters to paper over any shortcomings. Iron Fist starts to show signs of life in its sixth episode... but the slog in getting there is too great an ask, especially when {{the vast majority of the}} principal characters feel so spectacularly underdeveloped." [...] Fitzpatrick felt that Henwick's Colleen Wing was [...] "the most fully-realized character" [...] with [...] "a rich supporting performance" [...] that is overlooked in the early episodes. Uproxx's Alan Sepinwall felt of the first six episodes, [...] "Iron Fist is virtually all talk — most of it painfully dull — and the fighting is both brief and unconvincing. It’s easily the worst of the Netflix Marvel shows — where the others tend to start off well and then run into massive pacing problems around episode 8 or 9, Iron Fist begins as if it’s already at that sag point — and an unfortunate illustration of the perils of miscasting." [...] He also criticized Jones' fighting ability and the way the fights were filmed and edited. Some of the few positive for the season were the appearances of Carrie-Anne Moss as Jeri Hogarth and Dawson. Sepinwall concluded, [...] "the biggest problem with the new show is that no one involved seems to have any kind of take on the material. They’re just making a mostly faithful but personality-free adaptation because someone at Marvel decided four years ago that Danny (who often partners with Luke in the comics) had to be the final member of the team... we got a show that’s so lifeless that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> finishing out the season".|$|E

[...] And he kissed the royal hand in farewell.|$|R

5000|$|With {{respect to}} her essay, Mulvey {{stressed}} in a 2011 interview with Roberta Sassatelli: [...] "First, that the 1975 article [...] "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema" [...] was written as a polemic, and as Mandy Merck has described it, as a manifesto; so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> in modifying the argument. Clearly I think, in retrospect {{from a more}} nuanced perspective, about the inescapability of the male gaze." ...|$|R

5000|$|Although it {{has long}} been {{believed}} that he left because he was dissatisfied with the band moving into rock and roll, Leadon denies it and said in 2013: [...] "That's an oversimplification; it implies that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> in rock or blues or anything but country rock. That's just not the case. I didn't just play Fender Telecaster. I played a Gibson Les Paul and I enjoyed rock & roll. That's evident from the early albums." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Sabin {{shrugged his}} shoulders. [...] "By all means," [...] he murmured. [...] "Personally <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> them; {{but if you}} would talk like a {{reasonable}} man and tell me where your difficulty lies I {{might be able to}} help you." ...|$|E

60|$|Then she revived a little, but {{she never}} {{recovered}} her looks. I found out at the Club that the Other Man is coming up sick--very sick--on an off chance of recovery. The fever and the heart-valves had nearly killed him. She knew that, too, and she knew--what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> in knowing--when he was coming up.
