5|$|The {{first record}} of {{football}} being played on Tyneside dates from 3 March 1877 at Elswick Rugby Club. Later that year, Newcastle's first football club, Tyne Association, was formed. The origins of Newcastle United Football Club {{itself can be}} traced back to the formation of a football club by the Stanley Cricket Club of Byker in November 1881. This team was renamed Newcastle East <b>End</b> F.C. in October 1882, to avoid confusion with the cricket club in Stanley, County Durham. Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East <b>End</b> a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle East <b>End</b> moved from Byker to Heaton. In August 1882, Newcastle West <b>End</b> F.C. formed from West <b>End</b> Cricket Club, and in May 1886, the club moved into St James' Park. The two clubs became rivals in the Northern League. In 1889, Newcastle East <b>End</b> became a professional team, before becoming a limited company the following March. However, on the other hand, Newcastle West <b>End</b> were in serious financial trouble and approached East <b>End</b> with a view to a take over. Newcastle West <b>End</b> were eventually dissolved, and a number of their players and backroom staff joined Newcastle East <b>End,</b> effectively merging the two clubs, with Newcastle East <b>End</b> taking over the lease on St James' Park in May 1892.|$|E
5|$|This {{was not the}} <b>end</b> of the controversy.
