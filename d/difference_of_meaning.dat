60|$|An adjective, however, {{is capable}} of {{standing}} by itself as the predicate of a proposition; as when we say, Snow is white; and occasionally even as the subject, for we may say, White is an agreeable color. The adjective is often said to be so used by a grammatical ellipsis: Snow is white, instead of Snow is a white object; White is an agreeable color, instead of, A white color, or, The color white, is agreeable. The Greeks and Romans were allowed, {{by the rules of}} their language, to employ this ellipsis universally in the subject {{as well as in the}} predicate of a proposition. In English this can not, generally speaking, be done. We may say, The earth is round; but we can not say, Round is easily moved; we must say, A round object. This distinction, however, is rather grammatical than logical. Since there is no <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> between round, and a round object, it is only custom which prescribes that on any given occasion one shall be used, and not the other. We shall, therefore, without scruple, speak of adjectives as names, whether in their own right, or as representative of the more circuitous forms of expression above exemplified. The other classes of subsidiary words have no title whatever to be considered as names. An adverb, or an accusative case, can not under any circumstances (except when their mere letters and syllables are spoken of) figure as one of the terms of a proposition.|$|E

5000|$|The term Anasa {{occurs in}} Rig Veda V.29.10. What does the word mean? There are two interpretations. One is by Prof. Max Muller. The other is by Sayanacharya. According to Prof. Max Muller, it means 'one without nose' or 'one {{with a flat}} nose' and has as such been relied upon {{as a piece of}} {{evidence}} in support of the view that the Aryans were a separate race from the Dasyus. Sayanacharya says that it means 'mouthless,' i.e., devoid of good speech. This <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> is due to difference in the correct reading of the word Anasa. Sayanacharya reads it as an-asa while Prof. Max Muller reads it as a-nasa. As read by Prof. Max Muller, it means 'without nose.' Question is : which of the two readings is the correct one? There is no reason to hold that Sayana's reading is wrong. On the other hand there is everything to suggest that it is right. In the first place, it does not make non-sense of the word. Secondly, as there is no other place where the Dasyus are described as noseless, {{there is no reason why}} the word should be read in such a manner as to give it an altogether new sense. It is only fair to read it as a synonym of Mridhravak. There is therefore no evidence in support of the conclusion that the Dasyus belonged to a different race.|$|E

The mapping function {{is closely related to}} the neuronal mean field phase oscillator theory of temporal binding.

Quasiperiodic perceptual reversals are induced by attention satiation (fatigue) G(t) with time constant γ. The coupled attention – perception dynamics reproduces the experimentally observed Γ-distribution of the reversal time statistics if a stochastic noise term is added to the attention equation. Mean reversal times of typically 3 – 5 s as reported in the literature, are correctly predicted if T is associated with the delay of 40 ms between stimulus onset and primary visual cortex (V 1) response.

40|$|A {{behavioral}} nonlinear dynamics {{model of}} multistable perception due to ambiguous visual stimuli is presented. The perception state is formalized as the dynamic phase variable v(t) of a recursive process with cosinuidal transfer characteristic which {{is created by}} superposition (interference) of neuronal mean fields. The two parameters μ = <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> of alternative percepts and G = attention parameter, control the transition between unambiguous and ambiguous stimuli, e. g. from stimulus off to stimulus on, and attention fatigue respectively. Mean field interference with delayed phase feedback enables transitions between chaotic and limit cycle attractors v(t) representing the perception states. Perceptual reversals are induced by attention fatigue G(t) (~ adaptive gain g(v)) with time constant γ, and attention bias which determines the relative duration of the percepts. The coupled attention – perception dynamics with an additive stochastic noise term reproduces the experimentally observed Γ-distribution of the reversal time statistics. Mean reversal times of typically 3 – 5 s {{as reported in the}} literature, are correctly predicted if delay T is associated with the delay of 40 ms between stimulus onset and primary visual cortex (V 1) response.

The purpose of the paper is to examine if there are any differences in distribution and meaning between the two complements. The focus also lies on the different verbs occurring as complements, and the contrast between the verbs occurring as to-infinitives and as -ing participles. There are many theories which have been proposed on the subject that lie as a basis for the investigation. The analysis was carried out by means of an investigation of sentences taken from the COBUILDDIRECT corpus, and includes both spoken and written British and American English. The outcome of the analysis has demonstrated that there is usually agreement between the theories and the results; however, there is not always a <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> between the two complements. Moreover, the analysis suggests that there is a difference of verbs occurring as to-infinitives and -ing participles; the would like to construction represents a fixed expression and often occurs together with performative verbs. Finally, the conclusion has been drawn that there is a small but visible difference between the occurrences of the spoken and the written subcorpora when discussing both meaning and verbs occurring as complements. Since the to-infinitive complement is more common than the -ing participle in newspapers, books, and spoken English, the difference includes both detached and involved style as well as a regional difference between British and American English...|$|E

40|$|This article, first, {{discusses}} {{various types}} of contributions of linguistic expressions to {{the interpretation of the}} utterances including the expressions under the classification and the framework of Wilson and Sperber (1993). We have to deal with issues on two different levels: the conceptual/procedural distinction <b>of</b> the <b>meaning</b> encoded by linguistic expressions and the contribution to the truth conditions (i. e. truth conditional or non-truth-conditional) of the utterance including the expressions. Therefore, linguistic expressions are, in principle, classified into four types: conceptual and truth-conditional expressions contributing to the proposition expressed, conceptual and non-truth-conditional expressions contributing to the higher-level explicature, procedural and truth-conditional expressions constraining on the proposition expressed, and procedural and non-truth conditional expressions constraining on the implicature of the utterance. Second, procedural accounts are superior to discourse accounts in terms <b>of</b> analyzing the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> discourse connectives. In the discourse accounts, discourse connectives contribute to the coherent relation of the two linguistic units (cf. Schourup (1999 : 204)); therefore, it cannot fully explain the discourse-initial use of discourse connectives such as so and after all. However, this can be explicated by procedural accounts in which discourse connectives encode the constraint on the inference involved in utterance interpretation. In addition, procedural accounts enable us to explain the subtle <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> the <b>meaning</b> encoded by discourse connectives: i. e. the <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> between but, nevertheless or however, between so and therefore, or between because and after all.

Through the method of conversational analysis, “okay” with the rising intonation is compared with that with the falling intonation according to the situation and intention of the speaker. In addition, a comparison with scripted conversations in movies will reveal where naturalness of speech comes from. In the telephone conversation, the falling intonation is used more often. The speaker uses the rising intonation when he leads the conversation and puts emphasis on the intention of the speaker, and the falling intonation when the hearer leads the conversation and puts emphasis on the intention of the hearer. However, in the movie conversation, the rising intonation is used more often. While actors use the intonation in much the same way as in the telephone conversation, there are some exceptional cases. In the movie conversation, the rising intonation is used when the speaker is enthusiastic for the content of the conversation, and the falling intonation is used when the speaker is not enthusiastic. Consequently, the speaker conveys his intention by the difference of the intonation. Producers of movies let actors say lines to express their opinions. In the movie, they use “okay” to claim their opinions, and in the telephone conversation, we use “okay” to communicate with others. Namely, movie conversations are influenced more by the sentiment of the speaker. This difference leads to unnatural speeches found in movies...|$|E
40|$|Incompatibility (or co-hyponymy) is {{the most}} general type of {{semantic}} relation between lexical items, the meaning of which entails exclusion. Such items fall under a superordinate term or concept and denote sets which have no members in common (e. g. animal: dog-cat-mouse-lion-sheep; example from Cruse 2004). Traditionally, these have been of interest to lexical semanticists for {{the description of the}} structure of the lexicon. However, incompatibility is not just a relation that signifies a <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>meaning.</b> This paper is a critical corpus-assisted re-evaluation of the phenomenon of incompatibility which argues that the relation in question sometimes also functions as a discourse marker. Incompatibles indicate recurrent intertextual patterns. This holds particularly true for socially or politically controversial lexical items such as Flexibilität (flexibility), Mobilität (mobility) or Globalisierung (globalisation). Corpus investigations of such words have revealed that among other semantically related terms, incompatibles have a crucial discourse focussing function. For the German lexical item Globalisierung, I will show how its lexical usage can be studied through a corpus-driven analysis of corresponding incompatibles. Incompatible terms are not contingent co-words but often occur in close contextual proximity and participate in regular syntagmatic structures (e. g. Globalisierung und Rationalisierung; Globalisierung und Modernisierung; Neoliberalismus, Globalisierung und Kapitalismus). Hence, these are easily extracted by conducting a computational collocation analysis. Such significant collocates provide a good insight into the discursive and thematic contexts of the search word. Following Teubert (2004), I will demonstrate how the meaning of such lexical items is constituted in discourse and how the examination of these particular collocates reveals their senseconstructing function and their pragmatic-discursive force. I will provide a brief discussion of the methodology used for such analyses, and I will explain why the complex semantic-pragmatic and thematic-communicative patterns implied in sets of incompatibles should be given a stronger emphasis in lexicography. 1...|$|E
40|$|When artists draw on {{materials}} and techniques {{from an area}} such as science, they {{must be able to}} keep free from demonstration and verification. It is to be good at having a lyrical approach, imagining “the Earth is still flat " and considering sci-ence and technology as mysterious and fantastic tools. In the proposed image, a model of the tetrahedron designed by the Canadian scientist and inventor Alexander Graham Bell as a module for the gliders is al-tered. The change is made by the torsion of a plane surface, through developing formal ambiguity, thus depriving the object of its aerodynamic function. The model was then made available to a group of people with whom the artist opened a dialogue. Hence a spontaneous conversation was triggered {{about the nature of the}} object itself, from which it turned out a kaleidoscope of assump-tions, definitions, visual projections, constituting the series "No stars". Some stretches of the dialogue: "There are surfaces to which you can adhere in a metaphorical sense"; "The rotate plane is a lever that multiplies these surfaces toward infinity"; "Ironic instruments punctuate the experience"; "I can still imagine the earth as flat". Reflection concerns the inevitable sophistication produced by the attempt to define a form. And this sophistication is a "problem " we have in common. In fact a strong ambiguity is always encountered when it is sought to define an object, for the object is not merely placed in a space, but is itself a space. By de-contextualizing the object we have a first <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> and by altering it we have a second one. Thus it becomes as a "lever", which projects an endless becoming and an unbreakable repositioning of itself, transporting us in a field of huge possibilities. “No stars ” is a work in progress based on a single rule: neither the object nor its shadow will ever match the shape of a star...|$|E

This interdependence among the principles of dialogic learning favors constant social transformation.|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} of English intonation {{as a system}} shows that intonation is as systematic as {{other parts of the}} phonology. Because it is systematic, it can be presented in terms <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>meaning,</b> which in turn implies that intonation can be taught and learned. There is no need to think of intonation as a nebulous phenomenon that can only be appreciated in subjective, emotional terms, as one of the prosodic features which is so personal that it defies careful analysis. Intonation seems to be mainly conventional. Nevertheless, there is a strong personal, subjective, emotional element to it. 	If intonation was not conventional, we could never know what meanings it conveys; in order to interpret an intonation’s meaning, we have to assume that the intonation pattern that a person uses means the same thing when somebody else uses it. It is because intonation is conventional and we know what different patterns mean that we can make the comment about not liking the ‘way’ something was said. Thanks to the conventionality of intonation, we can analyse it reasonably objectively and describe it reasonably succintly...|$|R
5000|$|An {{example of}} Zeus' output is its {{analysis}} of Super Bowl XL between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Seattle Seahawks. Pittsburgh's play calling in [...] "binary" [...] situations exactly matched Zeus' {{evaluation of the}} optimal play choice. By contrast, Seattle's play calls differed in six instances, with a combined game winning probability <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> 8.40%, <b>meaning</b> that Zeus estimates that if Seattle had followed its play calls exactly then Seattle would have had an 8.4% better chance of winning the game.|$|R
