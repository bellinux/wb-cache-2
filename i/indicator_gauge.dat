40|$|One of {{the most}} crucial {{parameters}} for successful grouting {{is to ensure that}} the grout can penetrate the necessary apertures. For the most commonly used grout, cementitious grout, the available methods for determining the ability to penetrate apertures involves several measurements with different meshes or similar, which need to be evaluated. However, during the grouting process in the field there is rarely any time for evaluation and the most commonly used field method today stipulates a mesh width through which a certain volume need to pass. This implies that only an indirect measurement of the penetrability is performed. In order to perform direct and fast field measurements of the penetrability, a new, robust measuring device has been developed at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. The device is named PenetraCone and the measuring part consists of a gap that is formed between two conical cylinders. The penetrability characteristics are measured by decreasing this gap as grout flows through. The gap is measured using a dial <b>indicator</b> <b>gauge.</b> Initial tests with the PenetraCone show that two characteristic gaps or widths can be evaluated. The width as the grout flow goes from continuous flow to dripping is termed bfilter and when the flow stops completely it is termed bstop. The parameter bfilter is related to the commencement of clogging or filtration of the cementitious grout. This means that for apertures larger than bfilter the cement passes unrestricted but for narrower apertures filtration will commence. This filtration process will occur in apertures down to bstop, which indicates the smallest aperture that the cement can pass through and for apertures below bstop the cement will not penetrate at all. The device is easy to use and the tests show that consistent values are obtained. The accuracy seems good enough for use as a control of the penetrability of cementitious grouts in the field. For use in production, the PenetraCone should be placed on the grouting rig, after the mixer, so that direct measurements can be performed on the grout that will actually be used for grouting. By relating the measured parameters to the penetrability requirements, quick decisions regarding the quality of the grout can be made directly on the grouting rig...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The main aims of {{this study}} were to: 1) {{determine}} whether heavy use of Harpenden calipers caused deterioration of the spring coefficient (force per unit length), 2) to quantify the change in skinfold thickness per unit change in jaw closing (downscale) pressure, and 3) to develop a calibration range for these calipers. Methods: Part a) The change in spring force per unit length after at least 100, 000 cycles of opening and closing five different springs was measured on a load cell. Part b) The dynamic downscale jaw pressure exerted by six pairs of Harpenden springs was measured on one caliper. Two were new pairs of springs (N 1 and N 2), two were 25 -yr-old springs (O 1 and O 2), and two pairs (S 1 and S 2) had been used for less 1 yr. The six spring pairs were used to measure skinfold thicknesses at nine sites, in triplicate, on 20 subjects with the order of springs randomized and counterbalanced. Part c) The downscale jaw pressure of 78 Harpenden calipers was measured at eight jaw gaps. Results: Part a) The springs did not change their characteristics after > 100, 000 cycles. Part b) At each skinfold site, the lowest thickness was recorded for S 2 which exerted the highest jaw pressure (9. 04 g. mm(- 2)) and conversely the highest thickness was for N 1 which exerted the lowest jaw pressure (8. 02 g. mm(- 2)). Increasing the downscale jaw closing pressure from 8. 0 to 9. 0 g. mm(- 2) reduced a skinfold thickness by approximately 10 %. Part c) The mean downscale jaw pressure was 7. 82 +/- 0. 25 g. mm(- 2) Conclusions: In summary, it is suggested that if accurate skinfold measures between different Harpenden calipers are required, the downscale jaw pressure should be in the range of 7. 40 - 7. 82 and 7. 85 - 8. 21 g. mm(- 2), at jaw gaps of 5 and 40 mm, respectively. These jaw pressures can be achieved by servicing the caliper pivot and <b>indicator</b> <b>gauge</b> to minimize frictional losses, adjusting the caliper jaw alignment, and by selecting springs that have a spring coefficient in the range 1. 10 - 1. 15 N. mm(- 1) ...|$|E

In this study, we drew on rich data from two large British cohorts to test whether high levels of cognitive ability may protect children from experiencing the physical and mental health consequences of early life socioeconomic disadvantage.   Method: Participants from the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS; N = 11, 522) were followed from birth to age 42, and those from the 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS; N = 13, 213) were followed from birth to age 50.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to shed some light on what fiscal {{sustainability}} actually means. In doing so, it looks in the literature for a definition of fiscal sustainability that not only is theoretically sound, but can also be used for setting fiscal targets in practice. Sustainability is defined in a rather standard way - fiscal policy is said to be sustainable if the present value of future primary surpluses equals the current level of debt. This definition enables various sustainability indicators to be constructed. A good indicator of fiscal sustainability should signal, with a sufficient lead, excessive debt accumulation. The paper introduces several sustainability indicators varying in how closely they are related to the sustainability definition (the infinite and finite horizon gaps), whether they take account of the future evolution of spending (the primary gap and the tax gap) and what target value of debt is set at the end of a finite horizon. While the indicators can be used for different time horizons - from one year to an infinite horizon, the paper is by and large focused on long-term sustainability. When combined with long-term projections the <b>indicators</b> <b>gauge</b> the resilience of public finances to population ageing. The indicators are used to assess the sustainability of Czech fiscal policy. The sustainable revenue ratio, enabling the future surge in age-related spending to be financed, is estimated at 48 % of GDP in the Czech Republic. It is some 7 percentage points higher than the current revenue-to-GDP ratio. The sustainable primary balance stands at 0. 4 % of GDP. By observing this primary surplus, governments would stabilise the debt ratio in the long run. However, compliance with this target would require immediately raising taxes or cutting spending by almost 3. 0 % of GDP and containing any future spending pressures (projected at 7. 3 % of GDP) either by systemic reforms preventing age-related spending from rising or by annual discretionary spending cuts and tax increases [...] Fiscal sustainability, population ageing, primary gap, sustainability indicators, tax gap. ...|$|R
30|$|Pastoral {{households}} owned more livestock than agro-pastoral and off-farm households. This {{would be}} expected since ownership of livestock was the key indicator {{that was used to}} define a household as pastoral. At the same time, these households had their water sources spread over long distances as they occupied the most remote areas that could suitably be used for extensive grazing. If possession of livestock alone was to be the indicator of wealth, the pastoral households would be classified as the wealthiest. However, when other indicators of wealth such as the durable index were used, then agro-pastoral households emerged as the wealthiest. This observation exposes the weakness of using standard <b>indicators</b> to <b>gauge</b> pastoral well-being. Being relatively mobile, pastoral households are unlikely to accumulate fixed assets, although they could afford them if they wanted to. Lack of such assets among pastoral households may create a false impression about pastoral poverty.|$|R

It is found that banks with lower market-valued capital ratios have had higher returns on average than banks with higher market-valued capital ratios. However, we show that this negative relation between market-valued capital ratio and average stock returns could essentially be attributed to differences in exposure to risk factors. The market-valued capital ratio appears to proxy for sensitivity to common risk factors in bank stock returns. We also relate the cross-sectional variation in market-valued capital ratios to systematic patterns in relative profitability by showing that low market-valued capital ratio signals persistently poor profitability. Finally, we provide {{evidence to show that}} the market-valued capital ratio can indeed serve as a strong predictive indicator for bank's share performance during the financial crisis in the late 1990 s, even after controlling for a variety of other traditional risk measures.
