5|$|A pagan {{backlash}} against Christianity followed Æthelberht's death in 616, forcing Justus and Mellitus {{to flee to}} Gaul. The pair probably took refuge with Chlothar, hoping that the Frankish king would intervene and restore them to their sees, and by 617 Justus had been reinstalled in his bishopric by the new king. Mellitus also returned to England, but the prevailing pagan mood did not allow {{him to return to}} London; after Laurence's death, Mellitus became Archbishop of Canterbury. According to Bede, Justus received letters of <b>encouragement</b> from Pope Boniface V (619–625), as did Mellitus, although Bede does not record the actual letters. The historian J. M. Wallace-Hadrill assumes that both letters were general statements of <b>encouragement</b> to the missionaries.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an empirical study examining the <b>encouragements</b> used by teachers in EFL classes. To find out the actual use of <b>encouragements,</b> the authors first adopted the following two steps : 1) classroom video-observations of verbal <b>encouragements</b> by teachers in schools ranging from elementary to university level; and 2) a questionnaire survey to obtain students' attitudes and preferences toward <b>encouragements.</b> The frequency data shows that elementary school teachers tend to give more <b>encouragements</b> than those at other schools. Also, high school teachers are liable to provide fewer <b>encouragements.</b> Apart from teachers in junior high, teachers in senior high school and university directed more <b>encouragements</b> at individuals than at the whole class. In addition, huge differences between teachers' use and students' preferences of <b>encouragements</b> are found...|$|R
40|$|We hypothesise {{that the}} {{effectiveness}} of threats and <b>encouragements</b> is contingent on the intended recipient’s level of negative affect, as evidenced by his/her negative affective display. Therefore, bargainers can be more effective if, as they make offers, they condition any threats or <b>encouragements</b> on the recipient’s affective display. We test this hypothesis using 5561 verbal exchanges that occurred during 192 telephone conversations between credit collectors and debtors. Collectors were most effective in motivating debtors to discuss terms to resolve their debt if they: (1) threatened recipients who were nonresponsive and did not show any negative affect; and (2) encouraged recipients who displayed negative affect. This result suggests that making threats and <b>encouragements</b> contingent on a recipient’s displays of negative affect {{may be an important}} but frequently overlooked component of bargaining. When are threats and <b>encouragements</b> effective in bargaining? Observational evidence suggests that threats and <b>encouragements</b> are important in shaping Correspondence should be addressed to Mark Fichman, Tepper School of Business...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{current study}} aimed {{to examine how}} counselors' nonverbal {{communication}} (i. e. nonverbal <b>encouragements</b> and counselee-directed eye gaze) and conversational contribution (i. e. verbal dominance and interactivity) during the final visit within breast cancer genetic counseling relate to counselee satisfaction, needs fulfillment and anxiety. METHODS: Breast cancer counselees (N= 85) completed questionnaires measuring satisfaction, needs fulfillment and anxiety after the final consultation and anxiety before the initial visit. Consultations were videotaped. Counselor nonverbal <b>encouragements</b> and counselee-directed eye gaze were coded. Verbal dominance and interactivity were measured using the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS). RESULTS: More counselor nonverbal <b>encouragements</b> and higher counselor verbal dominance were both significantly related to higher post-visit anxiety. Furthermore, counselor verbal dominance was associated with lower perceived needs fulfillment. No significant associations with eye gaze and interactivity were found. CONCLUSION: More research is needed {{on the relationship between}} nonverbal <b>encouragements</b> and anxiety. Given the unfavorable association of counselor verbal dominance with anxiety and needs fulfillment, more effort could be devoted to involve counselees in the dialog and reduce the counselor's verbal contribution during the consultation. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Interventions focused on increasing counselees' contribution in the consultation may be beneficial to counselees...|$|R

30|$|Similarly, {{the average}} number of {{questions}} asked (per group) via Chat Box during the TAM concept mapping activity also was almost 2.5 times greater in the High Performance groups (3.63 questions asked on average) compared with the Low Performance groups (1.6 questions asked on average). In the same way, {{the average number}} of written sentences addressed to the whole group was 1.5 times greater in the High Performance groups (0.6 sentences addressed to the whole group on average per group) compared with the Low Performance groups (0.4 sentences addressed to the whole group on average per group). On the contrary, {{the average number of}} written sentences addressed to a specific person was 17 times greater in the Low Performance groups (1.7 sentences addressed to a specific person per group on average) compared with the High Performance groups (0.1 sentences addressed to a specific person per group on average). This was completely consistent with our results earlier achieved {{about the fact that the}} level of interactions in the Low Performance groups is much less than the level of interactions in the High Performance groups. The average number of <b>encouragements</b> written in the sentences was almost two times greater in the High Performance groups (0.55 <b>encouragements</b> written per group on average) compared with the Low Performance groups (0.3 <b>encouragements</b> written per group on average). The total number of acknowledgements written in the sentences was 2 in the High Performance groups compared with 0 in the Low Performance groups. Therefore, the average number of <b>encouragements</b> and acknowledgements written in the sentences was more than two times greater in the High Performance groups (0.325 <b>encouragements</b> and acknowledgements written per group on average) compared with the Low Performance groups (0.15 <b>encouragements</b> and acknowledgements written per group on average).
