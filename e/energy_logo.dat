25|$|Beginning in 2013, the livery layout for the NASCAR Cup Series was altered, {{coinciding with}} the change to the Generation 6 model car. In lieu of the series sponsor like in lower series, the {{windshield}} prominently features the last name of the driver (as well as first name or first initial {{in the case of}} siblings and family members, as is the case for both Busch brothers, or suffixes for drivers such as Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Martin Truex, Jr.) placed {{in the center of the}} windshield header. Logos of the manufacturer are placed on each corner of the upper windshield. Number and sponsor logos were barred from being placed on the headlights and taillights, as not to obstruct each car model's unique characteristics. A new location for a single sponsor logo, however, was added to the rear of the roof adjacent to the number. In 2014, a new layout was created for participants in the NASCAR Chase for the Championship, requiring the cars to feature yellow roof numbers, front splitters and front fascias. The background of the windshield header would also be colored yellow, with the driver's name displayed in black lettering. A new Chase for the Championship logo would replace the normal NASCAR Cup Series logo in the contingency group. A decal would also be placed next to the driver's name above the door to signify each win a driver earned that season. For 2015, the liveries of the Xfinity and Camping World Truck Series would feature the driver's last name on the upper rear window. Starting in 2017, the Monster <b>Energy</b> <b>logo</b> is now on the front windshield with the driver name moving to the rear windshield in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel robust watermarking approach called FuseMark {{based on the}} principles of image fusion for copy protection or robust tagging applications. We consider the problem of logo watermarking in still images and employ multiresolution data fusion principles for watermark embedding and extraction. A human visual system model based on contrast sensitivity is incorporated to hide a higher <b>energy</b> hidden <b>logo</b> in salient image components. Watermark extraction involves both characterization of attacks and logo estimation using a rake-like receiver. Statistical analysis demonstrates how our extraction approach can be used for watermark detection applications to decrease the problem of false negative detection without increasing the false positive detection rate. Simulation results verify theoretical observations and demonstrate the practical performance of FuseMark.

30|$|In {{addition}} to saving water, HE washers can also save energy. As much as 80 – 90 % {{of the energy}} used by washers is for heating the water used in the washing cycle (Electric Power Research Institute 2010). Because less water is required in HE washers, if the garments are washed in either hot or warm water, less energy is needed to heat the water. Another energy saving benefit of HE washers is a shorter drying time. Since HE washers have a significantly higher spin speed than conventional washers, water can be extracted more effectively. Less water means a shorter drying time after washing, resulting in energy cost savings {{of as much as}} 50 % (United States Environmental Protection Agency, Energy Start 2012). According to ENERGY STAR, a program developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Energy Star (2017), which promotes energy efficiency in products, a HE clothes washer needs to use at least 33 % less water and 28 % less energy than the minimum efficiency standards required by conventional washers to be able to carry the <b>ENERGY</b> STAR <b>logo.</b>|$|R

40|$|One of {{the first}} steps in the {{realization}} of an automatic system of bank check processing is the automatic classification of checks and extraction of handwritten area. This paper presents a new hybrid method which couple together the statistical color histogram features, the entropy, the energy and the Houph transform to achieve the automatic classification of checks {{as well as the}} segmentation and recognition of the various information on the check. The proposed method relies on two stages. First, a two-step classification algorithm is implemented. In the first step, a decision classification tree is built using the entropy, the <b>energy,</b> the <b>logo</b> location and histogram features of colored bank checks. These features are used to classify checks into several groups. Each group may contain one or more type of checks. Therefore, in the second step the bank logo or bank name are matched against its stored template to identify the correct prototype. Second, Hough transform is utilized to detect lines in the classified checks. These lines are used as indicator to the bank check fields. A group of experiments is performed showing that the proposed technique is promising as regards classifying the bank checks and extracting the important fields in that check...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Household energy use accounts for nearly one-fourth of all energy consumed in the United States, amounting to more than $ 200 billion per year spent by consumers. Recent increases in energy prices have heightened consumers' interest in making their households more energy efficient. To this end, the federal government manages two key efforts [...] EnergyGuide and Energy Star [...] to inform consumers about the energy consumed by certain household products. EnergyGuide is a mandatory labeling program created under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA) and administered by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with assistance from the Department of Energy (DOE). It requires manufacturers to label and prominently display information about the energy consumption and annual energy costs of 11 categories of household products. In recent years, manufacturers have used adhesive backed labels adhered to appliances and so-called "hang tags" loosely attached to the interior or exterior of appliances. In its August 2007 revisions to the rule, FTC, among other things, prohibited the use of hang tags on the exterior of appliances, but continues to allow them on the inside. The law requires retailers to provide this information in catalogs offering products for sale. In 2000, FTC interpreted its authority over catalogs to encompass Web sites and required retailers to provide the same information on Web sites where consumers may purchase such products. The law prohibits retailers from removing labels placed by manufacturers or making them illegible. Also, EPCA requires DOE, in consultation with FTC, to study new product categories {{to determine whether they}} should be added to the EnergyGuide program and to report annually on the energy savings of the program. Energy Star is a voluntary labeling program created in response to the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and jointly administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and DOE. In general, it is designed to identify models for 26 categories of household products that, without sacrificing performance, are the most energy efficient (the top 25 percent). Manufacturers are permitted to apply the <b>Energy</b> Star <b>logo</b> to products that the manufacturers identify are qualified, based on EPA or DOE criteria. Standards for internal control in the federal government require federal agencies, including FTC, EPA, and DOE, to establish goals, measure performance, and report program costs and accomplishments in order to improve management and program effectiveness. In this context, Congress asked us to analyze the EnergyGuide and Energy Star programs to determine (1) how these programs have changed over time, (2) how federal agencies verify the accuracy of the energy consumption estimates for household products covered by these programs, (3) the actions federal agencies take to ensure that the EnergyGuide is available to consumers and that the <b>Energy</b> Star <b>logo</b> is not misused, and (4) how federal agencies measure the effectiveness and cost of these programs. ...|$|R
