40|$|ABSTRACT: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is {{a growth}} factor-like {{mediator}} and a ligand for multiple GPCR. The LPA 2 GPCR mediates antiapoptotic and mucosal barrier-protective {{effects in the}} gut.

We developed an experimental SAR that is supported and rationalized by computational docking analysis of the SBA compounds into the LPA 2 ligand-binding pocket.

40|$|Guanyl radicals, {{the product}} of the removal of a single {{electron}} from guanine, are produced in DNA by the <b>direct</b> effect of <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b> We have produced guanyl radicals in DNA by using the single electron oxidizing agent (SCN) 2 –, itself derived from the indirect effect of <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> via thiocyanate scavenging of OH. We have examined the reactivity of guanyl radicals in plasmid DNA with the six most easily oxidized amino acids cysteine, cystine, histidine, methionine, tryptophan and tyrosine and also simple ester and amide derivatives of them. Cystine and histidine derivatives are unreactive. Cysteine, methionine, tyrosine and particularly tryptophan derivatives react to repair guanyl radicals in plasmid DNA with rate constants in the region of ∼ 105, 105, 106 and 107 dm 3 mol– 1 s– 1, respectively.

We suggest that models which combine viscous evolution with photoevaporation of the disc (e. g. Clarke, Gendrin & Sotomayor 2001) incorrectly neglect the direct field after the inner disc has drained, at late times in the evolution. We construct models of the photoevaporative wind produced by the direct field, first using simple analytic arguments and later using detailed numerical hydrodynamics. We find that the wind produced by the direct field at late times is much larger than has previously been assumed, and we show that the mass-loss rate scales as $R_{in}^{ 1 / 2 }$ (where $R_{in}$ is the radius of the instantaneous inner disc edge). We suggest that this result has important consequences for theories of disc evolution, and go on to consider the effects of this result on disc evolution in detail in a companion paper (Alexander, Clarke & Pringle 2006 b) ...|$|R
40|$|So far, organic {{semiconductors}} {{have been}} mainly proposed as detectors for ionizing radiation in the indirect conversion approach, i. e. as scintillators, which convert ionizing radiation into visible photons, or as photodiodes, which detect visible photons {{coming from a}} scintillator and convert them into an electrical signal. The direct conversion of ionizing radiation into an electrical signal within the same device is a more effective process than indirect conversion, since it improves the signal-to-noise ratio and it reduces the device response time.

With the aim to understand how electrical properties, and in particular a large charge carrier mobility, affect the radiation detection process in organic semiconducting single crystals, we compare the detection performance of rubrene-based devices with those of 1, 5 -dinitronaphthalene (DNN) -based ones. DNN has been recently {{proven to be a}} stable and reliable X-ray direct detector, operating at very low voltages, in air and at room temperature, with a carrier mobility values about two orders of magnitude lower than rubrene. We demonstrate here that the large charge carrier mobility of rubrene crystals does not result in a better X-rays detection performance.

In this study, steam-treated JSP reduced TOC, BOD and COD at 43, 33 and 23 %, respectively, whereas gamma-irradiated JSP reduced {{at a rate}} of 30, 40, 18 %. But still gamma irradiated JSP improved the properties more in comparison to control JSP. The reduction rate of TOC, BOD and COD in case of control JSP is 26, 23 and 20 %, respectively. In another study, adsorption of dyes on steam-treated sugarcane bagasse reduced TOC of 51 % (Kadam et al. 2013). The COD and BOD 5 load were reduced to 48 and 40 %, respectively, and this reduction rate is higher than our study. However, on that study they used 2  g of adsorbent, whereas we used 1  g of adsorbent (JSP). In another study, we used ionizing radiation for RTE (Parvin et al. 2015), where at 10  kGy direct gamma irradiation, the BOD 5 and COD reduced at a percentage of 59 and 61 %, respectively. In this method, the efficiency is higher compared to our results. However, when we consider about the cost, using pretreated JSP is more economical than using <b>direct</b> <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> on RTE.|$|E

40|$|Induced effects by <b>direct</b> {{exposure}} to <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> (IR) are {{a central issue}} in many fields like radiation protection, clinic diagnosis and oncological therapies. Direct irradiation at certain doses induce cell death, but similar effects can also occur in cells no directly exposed to IR, a mechanism known as bystander effect. Non-IR (radiofrequency waves) can induce the death of cells loaded with MNPs in a focused oncological therapy known as magnetic hyperthermia. Indirect mechanisms are also able to induce the death of unloaded MNPs cells. Using in vitro cell models, we found that colocalization of the MNPs at the lysosomes and the non-increase of the temperature induces bystander effect under non-IR. Our results provide a landscape in which bystander effects are a more general mechanism, up to now only observed and clinically used {{in the field of}} radiotherapy.

The gradient-corrected density functional B 3 LYP was applied in conjunction with double-ζ plus polarization and diffuse function basis sets. Optimized geometries, energies, and vibrational frequencies were obtained {{for all of the}} radicals considered. Structural perturbations along with energy relaxation due to radical formation were investigated. Dissociation energies of the G·C base pair and all of the radicals are predicted and compared with the dissociation energy of neutral G·C. The three lowest-energy base pair radicals all involve removal of an H atom from one of the N atoms in G·C. The lowest-energy base pair radical has the hydrogen atom removed from the guanine nitrogen atom used for the sugar phosphate linkage in DNA. This (G–H) •–C radical has a dissociation energy (to G–H• + C) of 30 kcal/mol, which may be compared with 27 kcal/mol for G·C. All of the radicals that are possible outcomes of <b>direct</b> <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> or oxidizing species were investigated for the presence of local minima with significant structural changes. Major structural deformations cause strain in the interstrand hydrogen bonding in the DNA double helix.

The US Department of Energy (DOE) and LMITCO made progress in developing and implementing a site-wide Environmental Management System. This system provides an underlying structure to make the management of environmental activities at the INEEL more systematic and predictable. Pathways by which INEEL contaminants might reach people off the INEEL were monitored. These included air, precipitation, water, locally grown food (milk, lettuce, wheat, and potatoes), livestock, game animals, soil, and <b>direct</b> <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b> Results from samples collected to monitor these pathways often contain ''background radioactivity,'' which is radioactivity from natural sources and nuclear weapons tests carried out between 1945 and 1980. According to results obtained in 1998, radioactivity from operations at the INEEL could not be distinguished from this background radioactivity in the regions surrounding the INEEL. Because radioactivity from the INEEL was not detected by offsite environmental surveillance methods, computer models were used to estimate the radiation dose to the public. The hypothetical maximum dose to an individual from INEEL operations was calculated to be 0. 08 millirem. That is 0. 002 percent of an average person's annual dose of 360 millirem from natural background radiation in southeast Idaho...|$|E

When erythrocytes are exposed to high dosage levels, radiation fixation (1) and the conversion of hemoglobin to methemoglobin (2, 3) are observed. At lower levels the production of radiation hemolysis is the most familiar feature. Early experiments indicated that this was secondary to permeability changes which cause the ceils to swell to ultlmnte rupture after radiation exposure (4 [...] 6).

Although point mutations {{have been studied}} extensively, much less is known about homologous recombination events, despite its role in causing sequence rearrangements that contribute to tumorigenesis. Although transgenic mice that permit detection of point mutations have provided a fundamental tool for studying point mutations in vivo, until recently, transgenic mice designed specifically to detect homologous recombination events in somatic tissues in vivo did not exist. We therefore created fluorescent yellow direct repeat mice, enabling automated detection of recombinant cells in vivo for the first time. Here, we show that an acute dose of <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> induces recombination in fluorescent yellow direct repeat mice, providing {{some of the first}} <b>direct</b> evidence that <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> induces homologous recombination in cutaneous tissues in vivo.

In addition, global methylation is suppressed and key DNA repair proteins are induced in tissues from chronically irradiated animals (specifically AP endonuclease, polymerase B, and Ku 70). Thus, increased clearance of recombinogenic lesions may contribute to suppression of homologous recombination. Taken together, these studies show that fluorescent yellow direct repeat mice provide a rapid and powerful assay for studying the recombinogenic effects of both short-term and long-term exposure to DNA damage in vivo and reveal {{for the first time that}} exposure to <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> can have opposite effects on genomic stability depending on the duration [...] ...|$|R

Many of environmental restoration projects have detected low levels of tritium contamination in local streams, ponds, and/or ground water. Typically these waters are moving or have the potential to move offsite and are viewed as a potential risk to the public and environment. Los Alamos National Laboratory will modify the well-proven long-range alpha detection (LRAD) technique for detection of <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> to optimize a system for detecting tritium in groundwater and other surfaces. The LRAD technique relies on detection of ionized air molecules rather than <b>direct</b> detection of <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation.</b> The detected electrical current is proportional to the number of ionized air molecules present, which is in turn a measure of the amount of contamination present. Although this technique has been used commercially to measure alpha contamination on objects and surfaces, the technique is also ideal for monitoring low-energy beta particles (such as those produced in tritium decay). We have demonstrated beta detection using 54 Mn, 14 C, 147 Pm, 99 Tc, 90 Sr, and 36 Cl sources. Thus, the detector technology and detection of beta particles using this technology have both been demonstrated. The extreme short range of tritium beta particles (less than a millimeter in air) necessitates an optimization of the detector system. In this paper, we will discuss these new designs...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{records of}} 194 {{patients}} with thyroid carcinoma treated with 1311, representing all cases thus treated in. Denmark from 1948 to 1972, were reviewed. Two cases of myeloid leukaemia were found compared with 0 * 097 expected cases of non-lymphocytic leukaemia (0. 05 > P> 0. 01). In 5 series of 131 I treated thyroid carcinomata,, 10 cases of myeloid leukaemia {{occurred in a}} total of 487 patients, corresponding to a frequency of leukaemia of about 2 %. These findings appear to show that 1311 treatment of thyroid carcinoma is associated with a certain risk of development of leukaemia. This risk must be considered when treatment of localized thyroid carcinoma is planned. <b>DIRECT</b> proof that <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> induces leukaemia in man does not exist, but there is a large body of suggestive evidence (Anderson et al., 1972; Cronkite, Moloney and Bond, 1960; Report of the United Nations Scientific Committee, 1972) indicating that leukaemia, predominantly of the myeloid variety, may be induced in individuals exposed to <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> accidentally or for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons. In very large series of patients (Pochin, 1961; Saenger, Thoma and Tompkins, 1968) treated with relatively low doses of 1311 for hyperthyroidism, no evidence has been found of an increased leukaemia risk which could be attributed to the treatment.
