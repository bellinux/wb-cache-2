40|$|In a {{companion}} paper, {{a method of}} global nondestructive evaluation (NDE) for identifying local damage and decay in timber beams was developed and verified analytically using a finite-element model of a timber beam. The previously presented method of damage localization employs experimental modal analysis and an algorithm that monitors changes in modal strain energy between the mode shapes of a damaged beam {{with respect to the}} undamaged state of the beam. In this second part of a two-part paper, experimental laboratory tests on simply supported timber beams are presented to verify the capabilities and determine the limitations of the proposed method of NDE in locating simulated damage in simply supported timber beams. Due to the natural variability inherent within a timber beam, the required severity of inflicted damage before the algorithm could correctly identify damage location was a 5. 08 -cm (2 -in.) <b>deep</b> <b>saw</b> cut in a beam with a depth of 15. 88 cm (6. 25 in.). For practical applications, the proposed technique could be used to identify the presence and general location of severe decay or damage, and if needed, more refined NDE techniques could be used to map the specific region affected by the decay or damage...|$|R

40|$|Concrete sawing {{operations}} are performed at pre-determined locations {{within the first}} 24 hours to prevent random cracking on jointed plain concrete pavements. In current construction procedures, the depth and {{the timing of the}} saw is usually established by the contractor based on experience. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the effect of several concrete mixture proportions and constituents on the early-age fracture properties and their effect on saw cut timing and depth for concrete pavements with several slab geometries. Concrete pavement mixtures with different coarse aggregate size and cementitious content were evaluated to determine the sensitivity of the measured fracture properties on saw cut model predictions. Finite element analysis was used to derive the geometric correction factors necessary to characterize the fracture properties of concrete based on the wedge plitting test configuration. A saw cut depth model proposed by Zollinger was modified to determine the timing and depth of notches on jointed plain concrete pavements. The theoretical analysis and practical example lead to the observation that if greater time is desired before saw cutting, the design should favor concrete materials with slower development of fracture properties. Larger coarse aggregate tends to increase concrete fracture toughness, and therefore will require <b>deeper</b> <b>saw</b> cuts. Thinner concrete pavements also require significantly deeper notch depth ratios relative to thicker slabs...|$|R

40|$|Tibial plateau {{fracture}} {{is a rare}} {{complication of}} unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. The fracture almost always occurs during surgery, {{and it is likely}} to be the result of a technical error, usually an unnecessarily <b>deep</b> vertical <b>saw</b> cut into the proximal tibia. However, anything that weakens or overloads the proximal tibia may contribute to fracture, such as damage to the posterior cortex, excess removal of bone particularly in small patients with osteopenic bones, inadequate preparation of the keel slot, or use of excessive force with a heavy hammer. This series of eight case reports presents our experience with this complication after medial Oxford unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and outlines a treatment protocol...|$|R

60|$|Edmund {{had kept}} {{ahead of the}} galleys, {{stopping}} at every town and village and warning {{the people of the}} approach of the marauders.

He worked offshore some two hundred yards, where be led me in water half to my hips. I had to try to stop him here, and with fear and trepidation I thumbed the reel.
