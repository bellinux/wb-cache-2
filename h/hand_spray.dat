40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{developed to}} estimate pesticide exposure intensity {{for use in}} epidemiologic analyses was revised {{based on data from}} two exposure monitoring studies. In the first study, we estimated relative exposure intensity {{based on the results of}} measurements taken during the application of the herbicide 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) (n = 88) and the insecticide chlorpyrifos (n = 17). Modifications to the algorithm weighting factors were based on geometric means (GM) of post-application urine concentrations for applicators grouped by application method and use of chemically-resistant (CR) gloves. Measurement data from a second study were also used to evaluate relative exposure levels associated with airblast as compared to <b>hand</b> <b>spray</b> application methods. Algorithm modifications included an increase in the exposure reduction factor for use of CR gloves from 40 % to 60 %, an increase in the application method weight for boom spray relative to in-furrow and for air blast relative to <b>hand</b> <b>spray,</b> and a decrease in the weight for mixing relative to the new weights assigned for application methods. The weighting factors for the revised algorithm now incorporate exposure measurements taken on Agricultural Health Study (AHS) participants for the application methods and personal protective equipment (PPE) commonly reported by study participants...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Bacterial {{contamination}} of raw processed poultry {{continues to be}} of concern to consumers as well as regulatory and health officials. For many years wings were considered a low-value product; therefore, shelf life of wings was not a major concern. Due to changes in consumer attitudes and increases in the fast-food market, wings are now a valuable commodity. Because wings have a shorter shelf life than most other raw poultry products, acceptable intervention to decrease the popula-tion of associated spoilage organisms and human entero-pathogens are needed. Safe 2 O Poultry Wash was evaluated as a postchill treatment to reduce microbial contamination and increase shelf life. Ninety-six carcasses were obtained from a local processor prior to final wash. On arrival at the research facility all carcasses were inocu-lated with 1 mL of a culture with 103 cfu/mL Listeria monocytogenes. After a 30 -min attachment time, carcasses were subjected to a 4 -s in-out final wash, hung for 3 min, and chilled in ice-water for 45 min. After the chilling, wings were removed by hand with a knife, pooled to-gether, and subjected to a <b>hand</b> <b>spray</b> (4 mL/wing) wit...|$|E

Two groups were kept under intensive tick control by weekly cypermethrin (Barricade) treatment by <b>hand</b> <b>spray</b> (one group immunized by the infection-and-treatment method and one non-immunized), 2 groups were under no tick control (one immunized and one non-immunized), and a fifth, immunized group was maintained under strategic tick control (18 sprays/year). ECF-specific mortality was highest in the non-immunized and non-treated (control) group, while no difference in ECF-specific mortality could be observed between animals treated for ECF by immunization or by tick control. Acaricide treatment and/or immunization reduced the risk of clinical ECF by 92 percent. The highest incidence of ECF occurred in the adult Rhipicephalus appendiculatus season of 1993, just after immunization. The results of an artificial challenge experiment {{at the end of}} the field trial indicated that about 60 percent of the animals in the control group had become infected with Theileria parva without showing clinical signs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{elaborate}} how to implement Search-assisted Search (SAS) scheme on the ONE simulator and analyze whether it has better performance compared with other protocols (such as, Spray and Wait Routing Protocol). SAS is a search scheme that is designed for Delay- tolerant networks (DTN). The main characteristic of DTN is intermittent connectivity. There are two popular routing protocols, called Epidemic Routing Protocol and Spray and Wait Routing Protocol. Epidemic Routing Protocol {{is the one that}} floods an unlimited number of messages towards the desired destination. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>Spray</b> and Wait Routing Protocol sprays a limited number of messages and delivers them to several nodes. When those nodes with a copy of the message encounter the desired destination, they will inform the one which initializes the search that the destination has been found. To improve search performance, SAS has several new properties: improvement of the number of contents' carriers and community. SAS contains the benefit of Spray and Wait scheme, which sprays a limited number of messages to the encountered nodes. This method accelerates the searching node to locate the content. However, only depending on spraying a number of messages is not enough. SAS increases the number of nodes carrying contents. Theoretically, this design improves the probability of locating the desired content. For making implementation of SAS on the ONE simulator easier, I involve a concept of geo-community.

40|$|Current small stock tick control {{practices}} and producer attitudes towards tick {{control in the}} eastern Cape Province of South Africa are discussed. These were ascertained from returns to a questionnaire survey to which 31, 2 % of farmers polled, responded. In general, producers did not favour an intensive tick control policy for small stock. Angora, mutton and wool farmers had a definite preference for synthetic pyrethroid acaricides, the majority treating either less than 6 times p. a. or between 11 - 15 times p. a. Most producers changed acaricides because of price. All small stock producers favoured plunge dip application of acaricides {{while the majority of}} wool sheep and Angora producers utilized footbath application as a second preference. Mutton producers favoured pour-on and <b>hand</b> <b>spray</b> application as a second choice. Producers who used plunge dip application techniques experienced the highest percentage of confirmed acaricide resistance which is in accordance with application preference. The general incidence of confirmed acaricide resistance, however, was of a low order but highest amongst mutton farmers. An average cost for acaricide treatment of R 1, 65 per small stock unit p. a. was calculated from data gained in this survey. Only a small number of producers used the available heartwater vaccine. Small stock mortalities experienced by producers per production unit indicated higher mortalities at high acaricidal treatment frequencies. Farmers allowing a small number of ticks to infest their sheep experienced fewer mortalities due to heartwater than those than kept their sheep free of ticks. Angora goat farmers experienced the same, but with higher mortalities, probably due to the apparently high susceptibility of Angora goats to heartwater.

The concentrations of retinol in the human milk of T infants were superior to concentrations in the milk of PT infants (1. 87 + 0. 81 > 1. 38 + 0. 67 mu mol/L, p 217. 65 + 105. 65 mu g, p < 0. 0001), but both were below the recommendation. VAD was 20. 0 % (T) and 27. 5 % (PT). Only 40. 0 % (T) and 22. 5 % (PT) of the mothers had retinol concentrations in milk above 2. 3 mmol/L. The milk of the nursing mothers studied did not have enough retinol to meet the daily needs and to form liver reserve in both groups, especially in PT newborns. This finding reinforces the idea that supplementation with massive doses of vitamin A in the immediate postpartum period {{can be used as a}} protective device of the infant against VAD.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDDirect {{methanol}} {{fuel cells}} (DMFCs) are attractive power sources as they offer high conversion efficiencies with low or no pollution. One {{of the major}} advantages DMFCs has over PEMFCs is that methanol is a liquid and can be easily stored where in the case for PEMFCs storing hydrogen requires high pressures and low temperatures. However, several challenging factors especially the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and {{the high cost of}} Pt catalysts, prolong their commercialization. With the aim to search for more active, less expensive more active ORR catalysts and methanol tolerant catalysts than pure Pt, this dissertation focuses on the development of low loading Pt electrocatalyst and the understanding of their physical and electrochemical properties. Pt-Sn/C electrocatalsyts have been synthesized by a modified polyol reduction method. The effect of temperature, pH, water, sonication and addition of carbon form were studied before a standard polyol method was established. From XRD patterns, the Pt-Sn/C peaks shifted slightly to lower 2 Ө angles when compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst, suggesting that Sn is alloying with Pt. Based on HRTEM data, the Pt-Sn/C nanoparticles showed small particle sizes well-dispersed onto the carbon support with a narrow particle distribution. The particle sizes of the different as-prepared catalysts were found to be between 2 - 5 nm. The Pt-Sn/C HA Slurry pH 3 catalysts was found to be the best asprepared catalyst and was subjected to heat-treatment in a reducing atmosphere at 250 - 600 °C which led to agglomeration yielding nanoparticles of between 5 - 10 nm. The Methanol Oxidation Reaction (MOR) on the as-prepared Pt-Sn/C HA Slurry pH 3 catalyst appeared at lower currents (+ 7. 11 mA at 860 mV vs. NHE) compared to the commercial Pt/C (+ 8. 25 mA at + 860 mV vs. NHE) suggesting that the Pt-Sn/C catalyst has „methanol tolerance capabilities‟. Pt-Sn/C HA Slurry pH 3 and Pt-Sn/C 250 °C catalysts showed better activity towards the ORR than commercial Pt/C with specific and mass activities higher than Pt/C at + 0. 85 V vs NHE. The Tafel slopes of Pt-Sn/C HA Slurry pH 3 catalyst was - 62 and - 122 mV dec- 1 for the low and high current regions respectively and suggests that the ORR mechanism {{is similar to that of}} commercial Pt/C indicating that the ORR kinetics was not negatively influenced by the addition of tin. It was found that the electrochemical oxidation reduction reaction follows first order kinetics of a multi-electronic (n= 4 ē) charge transfer process producing water. All the Pt-Sn/C catalysts showed resistance towards MOR and it was found for the heat-treated catalysts that an increase in temperature resulted in an increase in methanol tolerance. The synthesized Pt-Sn/C HA Slurry pH 3 catalysts were also tested in a fuel cell environment. Electrodes were prepared by either spraying on Toray carbon paper with the Asymtek machine or by VI spraying directly on the membrane with a <b>hand</b> <b>spray</b> gun the catalysts coated membrane (CCM) technique. Polarization curves obtained in DMFC with CCM showed superior performance than electrode prepared by spraying on the carbon paper with the machine.
