40|$|Background:To achieve optimal colonoscopic examination, the bowel must be {{sufficiently}} cleansed. However, {{none of the}} currently available colonoscopy preparation regimens is safe, efficient, and comfortable. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether adding stewed apricot juice to senna increased patient comfort and improved bowel cleansing during colonoscopy preparation. Methods: Outpatients of both genders who were over 18 years old and were referred for elective colonoscopy were randomly allocated to drink stewed apricot juice with senna or senna by itself. The quality of the colon cleansing was evaluated using the Ottawa scale. Patient tolerance and adverse events were evaluated through the completion of a questionnaire. Results: The study included a total of 128 patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> randomization procedure. A significantly greater cleansing effect was observed using stewed apricot juice plus senna <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right and transverse colon (p = 0. 038, p = 0. 037 respectively). It was also determined that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stewed</b> apricot juice plus senna group, overall cleansing was superior (p < 0. 001), total colonoscopy (17. 6 min vs. 22. 8 min, p = 0. 048) and cecal intubation (7. 4 min vs. 11. 2 min, p = 0. 042) times were shorter, and the colonoscopy procedure was easier (79. 4 % vs. 49. 2 %, p < 0. 001). No differences were observed between the groups with respect to patient acceptance, compliance, and events. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>stewed</b> apricot juice plus senna group, 91. 2 % of patients stated their willingness to receive <b>the</b> same regimen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future compared to 80 % of <b>the</b> patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> senna alone group (p = 0. 037). Conclusion:The addition of natural, stewed apricot juice to senna significantly improves cleansing outcomes without additional adverse effects.

In a Tunisian version, the brown eggs are cooked separately in a metal pot on the all-night stove with water and tea leaves (similar to tea eggs). Haminados can be cooked in this way even if no hamin is prepared. The addition of tea leaves, coffee grinds, or onion skins to the water dyes the shell purple and the white a light brown, giving the egg a smooth creamy texture. In Israel, brown eggs are a popular accompaniment to ful medames (a dish of mashed broad beans) and they may also be served with hummus (a dip of mashed chickpeas mixed with tahini) and in a Sabich sandwich.|$|R

40|$|The {{discovery}} of nitrite contamination aroused public concern {{on the safety}} of cubilose consumption. Here, forty-eight batches of cubilose were randomly purchased from Hong Kong market. The median nitrite content {{of different types of}} cubilose was as follows: Red cubilose (600 ppm) Yellow cubilose (510 ppm);White cubilose (100 ppm). Under a developed standardized processing method, up to 98 % of nitrite was removed from cubilose; nitrite was not detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stewed</b> cubilose. To search for the source of nitrite, droppings from swiftlets and water samples were collected from production sites of cubilose in Malaysia and Indonesia, and which contained a high amount of nitrate. On the other hand, the protein extract of cubilose was subjected to proteomics analysis. A microbial nitrate reductase was identified by mass spectroscopy, which converted nitrate to nitrite in cubilose. A specific inhibitor of nitrate reductase successfully abolished the nitrate reduction activity found in cubilose, which subsequently reduced <b>the</b> nitrite <b>in</b> cubilose. This phenomenon was successfully proven by the field study. Thus, the nitrite on cubilose could be a result of the contaminating nitrate reductase. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
