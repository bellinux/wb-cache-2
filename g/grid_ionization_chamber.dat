This experiment was performed with the recoil mass spectrometer LOHENGRIN at ILL in Grenoble, France. When {{the results from this}} work, where the compound nucleus is at thermal excitation, are compared to the spontaneous fission of 252 Cf, enhanced emission yields as well as an increased mean kinetic energy is observed around A = 115. This suggests the existence of an additional super-deformed fission mode in 252 Cf.

However, the predicted changes in fission fragment distributions could not be confirmed.

40|$|Nuclear data {{related to}} the fission process are needed {{for a wide variety}} of {{research}} areas, including fundamental science, nuclear energy and non-proliferation. While some of the relevant data have been measured to the required accuracies there are still many aspects of fission that need further investigation.

The PMTs are designed to operate within the liquid and to efficiently detect the 175 nm Xe light. Their small transit time spread makes them ideal for fast timing applications. To evaluate the timing characteristics of a liquid xenon detector, we tested a <b>gridded</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> equipped with two such PMTs. Both PMTs observe the same interaction and share the detected scintillation light about equally. At zero field the measured timing resolution is 565 ps FWHM for 122 keV from 57 Co and 227 ps FWHM for 662 keV from 137 Cs. For electric fields up to 4 kV/cm drift field the timing resolution remained constant.

40|$|Background: One {{important}} quantity {{in nuclear}} fission {{is the average}} number of prompt neutrons emitted from the fission fragments, the prompt neutron multiplicity. The total number of prompt fission neutrons increases with increasing incident neutron energy. The prompt-neutron multiplicity is also a function of the fragment mass and the total kinetic energy of the fragmentation. Those data are only known in sufficient detail for a few thermal-neutron-induced fission reactions on, for example, 233, 235 U and 239 Pu. The enthralling question has always been asked how the additional excitation energy is shared between the fission fragments. The answer to this question is important in the analysis of fission-fragment data taken with the double-energy technique. Although in the traditional approach the excess neutrons are distributed equally across the mass distribution, a few experiments showed that those neutrons are predominantly emitted by the heavy fragments. Purpose:We investigated the consequences of the ν(A, TKE,En) distribution on the fission fragment observables. Methods: Experimental data obtained for the 234 U(n,f) reaction with a Twin Frisch <b>Grid</b> <b>Ionization</b> <b>Chamber,</b> were analyzed assuming two different methods for the neutron evaporation correction. The effect of the two different methods on the resulting fragment mass and energy distributions is studied. Results: We found that the preneutron mass distributions obtained via the double-energy technique become slightly more symmetric, and that the impact is larger for postneutron fission-fragment distributions. In the most severe cases, a relative yield change up to 20 – 30 % was observed. Conclusions: We conclude that the choice of the prompt-neutron correction method has strong implications on the understanding and modeling of the fission process and encourages new experiments to measure fission fragments in coincidence with prompt fission neutrons. Even more, the correct determination of postneutron fragment yields has an impact on the reliable assessment of the nuclear waste inventory, {{as well as on the}} correct prediction of delayed neutron precursor yields.

40|$|The {{spontaneous}} fission of 252 Cf {{serves as an}} excellent benchmark of prompt emission in fission since experimental data can be obtained without the need of an incident beam. With the purpose of providing experimental data on the prompt fission neutron properties in correlation with fission fragment characteristics an experiment on 252 Cf(SF) has been performed. In addition, the experiment serves as benchmark of setup and analysis procedures for measurements of fluctuations in the prompt neutron properties {{as a function of}} incident neutron energy in fission of the major actinides 235 U and 239 Pu. The experiment employs a twin Frisch <b>grid</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> as fission fragment detector while neutrons where counted using a liquid scintillator placed along the symmetry axis of the ionization chamber. Average neutron multiplicity has been obtained as a function of fission fragment mass and total kinetic energy (TKE). The average multiplicity as a function of mass agrees well with available literature data in the mass range from 80 to 170 amu. The existence of additional sawtooth structures in the far asymmetric mass region could not be confirmed, although the statistical accuracy of the present experiment is as good as the previous study where such structures have been reported [C. Budtz-Jorgensen and H. -H. Knitter, Nucl. Phys. A 490, 307 (1988) ]. The available literature data on the TKE dependence of the multiplicity show strong deviations. Therefore, effort was focused on investigating experimental factors in low efficiency neutron counting experiments that may lead to faulty determination of this dependence. Taking these factors into account a result that agree well with data from high efficiency neutron counting experiments is obtained. The experimental arrangement allows determination of the angle between the detected neutron and the fission axis, which permits the neutron properties to be transformed into the fission fragment rest frame. Fission neutron emission spectra in the fragment center of mass frame has thereby been obtained {{as a function of the}} fission fragment mass and TKE. JRC.

40|$|During the {{dismantling}} of nuclear installations much building material must be disposed of. The material can be potentially contaminated by radio nuclides. Because the contamination levels are often around the legal activity levels, an accurate and quick method is essential {{to determine whether or}} not this material can be treated as radioactive or non-active waste. In-situ measurements are available for the determination of #gamma#- and #beta#-activity. A direct measurement of #alpha#-activity - radiation in the building material is impossible because the #alpha#-particles are absorbed in the concrete. Chemical analysis of #alpha#-contaminants included many time consuming analytical steps and is therefore rather unsuitable. We developed direct #alpha#-spectroscopy after only mechanical preparation of the concrete samples. We obtained suspensions with an average diameter of the particles of 0. 5 #mu#m by crushing in a two-step process. The measuring sources with a diameter of 20 cm and 0. 6 to 5 #mu#m thickness were prepared by pouring ore spraying onto plates and subsequent drying. The spectra of these sources were measured using a <b>grid</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber.</b> Using standard concrete with added actinides, we determined the peak shape and the self absorption of the #alpha#-radiation as the function of the sample layer's thickness. We fitted and deconvoluted the spectra of unknown samples with this peak shape of standard samples having the same thickness. With a geometrical model for particle size, distribution and packing density the radiation transport ca be calculated. The simulated spectra agree with the measured spectra. The program WINKRUM based on these calculations and also allows to deconvolute multi element spectra of concrete sources. With this direct measurement of thin sources #alpha#-emitting radio nuclides in multi element spectra can be detected as low as 0. 02 Bq/g within 30 h. (orig.) Beim Abriss von Nuklearanlagen fallen grosse Mengen Bauschutt an, die mit Radionukliden kontaminiert sein koennen. Da diese Kontaminationen haeufig nahe der Freigrenze liegen, ist fuer die Entscheidung, ob das Material als radioaktiver Abfall behandelt werden muss oder freigegeben werden kann, eine schnelle und exakte Methode notwendig. Die Bestimmung der #gamma#- und #beta#-Aktivitaet ist mit in-situ Messungen moeglich. Eine direkte Messung der #alpha#-aktiven Nuklide im stehenden Gebaeude ist auf Grund der geringen Reichweite der #alpha#-Strahlung und ihrer Absorption im Beton nicht moeglich. Die uebliche chemische Analyse der #alpha#-aktiven Nuklide ist sehr zeitaufwendig. Im Rahmen dieses Projektes wurde eine Methode der direkten #alpha#-Spektrometrie nach nur mechanischer Praeparation des Betons entwickelt. In einem aus zwei Schritten bestehendem Zerkleinerungsprozess wurden Suspensionen mit mittleren Partikeldurchmessern von 0, 5 #mu#m erhalten. Die Messproben mit einem Durchmesser von 20 cm und Schichtdicken zwischen 0, 6 und 5 #mu#m wurden durch Giessen oder Spruehen auf die Probentraeger und anschliessendes Trocknen hergestellt. Die Spektren dieser Proben wurden in einer Gitterionisationskammer aufgenommen. Durch die Verwendung von Standardbeton mit dotierten Actiniden konnten die Selbstabsorption der #alpha#-Strahlung und die Peakform in Abhaengigkeit der Schichtdicke ermittelt werden. Unbekannte Betonproben gleicher Geometrie konnten mit Hilfe dieser ermittelten Peakform entfaltet werden. Das fuer diese Arbeit entwickelte Programm WINKRUM basiert auf einem geometrischen Modell fuer Partikelgroesse, Partikelverteilung und Packungsdichte. Mit Strahlungstransportberechnungen koennen Spektren simuliert werden, die ebenfalls eine Peakentfaltung von Multielementspektren ermoeglichen.

Investigation of the operating parameters of the prototype led to an energy resolution of 8. 69 (1) % when running the detector with a gas mixture of 90 % argon and 10 % methane (referred to as P 10) at a gas pressure of 1800 Torr. Digital read-out of the signal allowed signal risetimes to be successfully evaluated on an event-by-event basis. However, electric field inconsistencies limited the energy resolution achievable. An electric field cage should be installed to encourage a uniform field between the detector plates. The Nuclear Science Laboratories at Simon Fraser University are embarking upon a program of research to address various topics of interest to modern science such as the origin, production, composition and structure of exotic, neutron-rich isotopes. The study of fission fragments is {{an effective way to}} investigate neutron-rich nuclei. <b>Ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> are an appropriate and versatile tool with which to study fission fragments, and can be built {{in such a way as}} to allow energy, mass and charge measurements of both fragments. The single-sided prototype is a crucial first step towards the final design which will allow such measurements...|$|R

In the ideal Frisch grid chamber the anode pulse height is independent of where inside the sensitive volume the charge has been created. This ideal cannot be realized because of imperfect shielding of the anode by the grid. The effect of the imperfect shielding is generally referred to as grid inefficiency. For accurate energy determination the anode pulse height needs to be corrected for this. At present two opposing explanation for grid inefficiency exist. The first explanation {{suggests that there is}} a reduction of the anode pulse height. This is said to arise from positive ions inducing charge on the anode as the electrons are collected. The second explanation suggests that there is a too large anode signal. The addition to the anode signal is said to arise from the drift of electrons. In this thesis the concept of grid inefficiency is investigated by means of wave form digitization. The use of digital signal processing makes it possible to maintain information on the drift of electrons. This information is lost in charged particle spectroscopy experiments using electronic signal processing networks. A series of experiments is described in this thesis. The first experiment was performed to find good measuring conditions for the following experiments. For this purpose the drift velocity of electrons was measured in two chamber filling gases, P- 10 and CF 4. The measured drift velocities are presented for the two gases. Finally, P- 10 was chosen as filling gas for the following experiments. In the second experiment the grid inefficiency was measured for two different types of shielding electrodes. The method of determining the grid inefficiency is based on the analysis of the shape of digitized charge signals. The measured values are shown to be in good agreement with calculated values. In the final experiment the effects of grid inefficiency on alpha particle spectroscopy is investigated. It is shown how the correction for grid inefficiency by the two existing models yield equivalent results for energy determination. An attempt to separate the two models is also presented indicating that there is in fact a reduction of the anode pulse height because of grid inefficiency. The thesis is concluded with a theoretical discussion of the anode pulse shape. There grid inefficiency is explained by the drift of electrons. It is shown in this section how explaining grid inefficiency by the drift of electrons should yield the same result as explaining it by the effect of positive ions...|$|R

The chamber has a volume of 240 cm 3, weight of 2. 5 kg, and is open to atmospheric conditions. The well-type <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> dosimetric characteristics such as leakage current, stability, scattering effect, ion collection efficiency, and nominal response with energy were studied. The evaluated dosimetric characteristics of well-type <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> were compared with two other commercially available well-type <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers.</b> The study shows that the newly developed well-type <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> is reliable for air-kerma strength calibration.

In the present investigation, the relative response of 17 cylindrical <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> was evaluated at three proton beam qualities: at two points in a modulated beam and one point in a non-modulated beam, all with an incident energy of 75 MeV. Thirteen of the <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> had a Farmer-type geometry but consisted of different combinations of wall and central electrode materials. All <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> were calibrated in terms of air kerma as well as in terms of absorbed dose to water in a Co- 60 beam. The relative response of the <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> was compared with results of Monte Carlo simulations of proton and secondary electron transport in the phantom and the <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> geometry. The results of the measurements for cylindrical <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> show relative perturbation effects that are limited to 0. 5 - 1 %, resulting in perturbation correction factors that are larger than unity compared with an NE 2571 <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber.</b> The experimental relative wall and total perturbation correction factors agree with Monte Carlo calculated values, indicating that the differences between the responses of different <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> are due to secondary electron effects, This conclusion is supported by the comparison of our results with those from other investigators after re-analysis of their data. The central electrode perturbation correction factor for an aluminium electrode in a Farmer-type geometry was found to be unity within the experimental uncertainties...|$|R
