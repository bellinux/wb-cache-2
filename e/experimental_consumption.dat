40|$|We {{propose a}} method to {{quantify}} the willingness-to-pay for the consumption of others in group decisions. Our method is based on revealed preference theory. It measures willingness-to-pay for others' consumption by evaluating positive consumption externalities in monetary terms. Within the framework of cooperative (i. e. Pareto efficient) consumption behavior, we introduce a selfishness parameter that defines a continuum of models that are characterized by varying degrees of consumption externalities. We use our method to analyze decisions made by dyads of children in an <b>experimental</b> <b>consumption</b> setting. We find that children's consumption decisions are systematically characterized by externalities (i. e. non-selfish). But we also observe that there is substantial heterogeneity across children, which we can relate to differences in age, gender and degree of friendship between dyad members. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Alcohol is an {{addictive}} {{substance that}} is integrated and normalized indifferent cultural contexts, and therefore has {{different forms of}} social representation. These have evolved significantly over the years, {{as evidenced by the}} changing consideration of alcohol as avice to a disease in developed societies over the last fifty years. Social representation {{is considered to be a}} way of building and interpret in reality and of integrating collective beliefs. However, a leitmotif exists in societies that have traditionally consumed alcohol, characterized by a great permissiveness that leads to increased consumption. We have reviewed some works that analyze these issues and in conclusion, we point out that social representation is a modifiable construct that may be used as a preventive action in alcohol consumption in thegeneral population and more specifically, in <b>experimental</b> <b>consumption</b> amongst young people...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the lifetime- 12 months- and 4 -weeks- prevalences of psychoactive substance use among 14 - 20 years old adolescents in Grenada W. I. was carried out as a descriptive cross-sectional study of a representative population of students (787 students) attending Secondary Schools. In a comparison between schools with urban and rural locations, prevalence rates were contrasted and variables determined regarding age and gender as influencing factors for consumption, {{as well as the}} influence of socio-economic and -demographic factors in the context of family structure, peer influences, and health awareness. As instrument assessing the data a selfadministered questionnaire was applied. The statistical bivariate analysis was carried out using two-by-two contingency tables, the chi 2 test for significance, and the Mantel-Haenszel test for homogeneity. For univariate and multivariate qualification of the risk factors with reference to the dependent variables, logistic regression analysis was applied. The {{evaluation of}} the preliminary test - retest indicated a Cronbach alpha score of 0. 6 - 0. 8 for the relevant items, thus showing good to very good reliability of the response behaviour. Alcohol proved to be the drug of first choice for young people. The lifetime - prevalence of the overall population was found to be 87. 7 % for male and 70 % for female students. For the lifetime prevalence of marihuana, 19. 1 % of the boys and 9. 3 % of the girls reported consumption at some time. The lifetime prevalence for tobacco smoking for the sample population was 26. 9 % for male and 17. 5 % for female students. Gender-specific comparison of the urban and rural sub-populations for the 12 -month period showed a risk for alcohol consumption for girls that was statistically significantly lower (OR 0. 6 urban/ 0. 4 rural) and for marihuana consumption a lower risk (OR 0. 4) for females in the rural sub-population. For both genders the lifetime prevalence for cigarette smoking showed a significantly higher risk in the urban subpopulation (OR 1. 6 males / OR 1. 7 females). A statistically significant predictor in the phase of <b>experimental</b> <b>consumption</b> of psychoactive substances among the socio-economic and -demographic aspects and also age - specific factors was the amount of money available per day. Professional qualifications of both parents and a two-parent-household were evaluated as protective factors. Special risks for the consumption of marihuana were found for male (OR 2. 1) and female students (OR 4. 4) in the urban sub-population from single-parent households. Parental consumption of alcohol, having peers who consume alcohol and drugs and being introduced to illegal drugs by friends were significant predictors for consumption of psychoactive substances, along with curiosity, the desire to be accepted, and religious motives. Across cultures in industrial and threshold countries, predictors of consumption of psychoactive substances by adolescents in the phase of <b>experimental</b> <b>consumption</b> {{are to be found in}} the family setting and in peer group influence. Further evaluations are necessary which also include risk groups such as school drop-outs, in order to analyse trends and to develop and implement differentiated prevention programmes. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{feature of}} human culture {{is that we}} can learn to consume {{chemical}} compounds, derived from natural plants or synthetic fabrication, for their psychoactive effects. These drugs change the mental state and/or the behavioral performance of an individual and can be instrumentalized for various purposes. After the emergence of a novel psychoactive substance (NPS) and a period of <b>experimental</b> <b>consumption,</b> personal and medical benefits and harm potential of the NPS can be estimated on evidence base. This may lead to a legal classification of the NPS, which may range from limited medical use, controlled availability up to a complete ban of the drug form publically accepted use. With these measures, however, a drug does not disappear, but frequently continues to be used, which eventually allows an even better estimate of the drug 19 s properties. Thus, only in rare cases, there is a final verdict that is no more questioned. Instead, the view on a drug can change from tolerable to harmful but may also involve the new establishment of a desired medical application to a previously harmful drug. Here, we provide a summary review on a number of NPS for which the neuropharmacological evaluation has made important progress in recent years. They include mitragynine (1 CKratom 1 D), synthetic cannabinoids (e. g., 1 CSpice 1 D), dimethyltryptamine and novel serotonergic hallucinogens, the cathinones mephedrone and methylone, ketamine and novel dissociative drugs,; 3 -hydroxybutyrate,; 3 -butyrolactone, and 1, 4 -butanediol.

In recent years, ultra-low power Wake-up Receivers (WuRx) have emerged, enabling pure asynchronous wireless communication that eliminates energy waste due to idle listening. However, to achieve a significant increase of energy efficiency compared to traditional duty-cycling approaches, Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols exploiting WuRx must be carefully designed. Therefore, we propose an analytical framework to model MAC protocols, leveraging WuRx or not, which gives an important evaluation of power consumption, latency and reliability.
