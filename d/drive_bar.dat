30|$|In {{addition}} to their distinctive topological features, {{we found that the}} nodes on the redirection paths attached to a Bar often exhibit remarkable homogeneity in their content and network properties. Particularly, for the websites directly connecting to the repository, we found that they typically use a small set of templates (like WordPress) to build up their web pages, include similar DOM positions for script injection, carrying similar IP addresses or even having the same content management system (CMS) vulnerabilities, etc. These properties turn out to be very diverse among those utilizing a legitimate cloud repository.

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry {{is one of}} the most dynamic and competitive segments of the international economy and it has invested considerable resources into the research and development of new components and the improvement of existent pieces. Nonetheless, failures continue to occur, often because of defects in a component. Failure analysis uses several techniques to investigate causes of the defect which led to the failure of a component, equipment, or structure. Usually, these causes are related to the use of inadequate materials, the presence of defects which appear during fabrication or design errors, or improper assembly, maintenance and use. Knowledge about these causes and the correction of such anomalies allow the improvement of the performance of components regarding both efficiency and safety. In this study, the results of the failure analysis of the <b>drive</b> <b>bar</b> of a police car are presented and light optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results are used to show that the presence of an already existent defect and an unfavorable microstructure led to the occurrence of brittle fracture which caused the premature and catastrophic failure of this component...|$|E

40|$|A mobile remote {{manipulator}} system is disclosed for assembly, repair and logistics transport on, around {{and about a}} space station square bay truss structure. The vehicle {{is supported by a}} square track arrangement supported by guide pins integral with the space station truss structure and located at each truss node. Propulsion is provided by a central push-pull drive mechanism that extends out from the vehicle one full structural bay over the truss and locks drive rods into the guide pins. The draw bar is now retracted and the mobile {{remote manipulator}} system is pulled onto the next adjacent structural bay. Thus, translation of the vehicle is inchworm style. The <b>drive</b> <b>bar</b> can be locked onto two guide pins while the extendable draw bar is within the vehicle and then push the vehicle away one bay providing bidirectional push-pull drive. The track switches allow the vehicle to travel in two orthogonal directions over the truss structure which coupled with the bidirectional drive, allow movement in four directions on one plane.

40|$|The {{patterns}} of depth, velocity, and shear stress that direct a river's morphologic evolution {{are governed by}} a balance of forces. Analyzing these forces, associated with pressure gradients, boundary friction, channel curvature, and along- and across-stream changes in fluid momentum driven by bed topography, can yield insight regarding the establishment and maintenance of stable channel forms. This study examined how components of the local force balance changed as a meandering channel evolved from a simple, flat-bedded initial condition to a more complex bar-pool morphology. A numerical flow model, constrained by measurements of velocity and water surface elevation, characterized the flow field for four time periods bracketing two floods. For each time increment, runs were performed for discharges up to bankfull, and individual force balance components were computed from model output. Formation and growth of point bars enhanced topographic steering effects, which were of similar magnitude to the pressure gradient and centrifugal forces. Convective accelerations induced by the bar reduced the cross-stream pressure gradient, intensified flow toward the outer bank, and routed sediment around the upstream end of the bar. Adjustments in the flow field thus served to balance streamwise transport along the inner bank onto the bar and cross-stream transport into the pool. Even {{in the early stages}} of bar development, topographically driven spatial gradients in velocity played a significant role in the force balance at flows up to bankfull, altering the orientation of the shear stress and sediment transport to <b>drive</b> <b>bar</b> growth.

40|$|International audienceA {{field of}} long-crested {{transverse}} bars was monitored from a 2. 5 -year series of topographic Lidar surveys {{in the vicinity}} of a tidal inlet on the macrotidal (mean spring tidal range = 7 to 12 m) west coast of Cotentin (Normandy, France). The bar field, the alongshore extent of which is about 1. 8 km, is composed of a total of 8 bars with lengths varying from 320 m to 1300 m and mean heights comprised between 0. 5 m and 2. 5 m. Bar cross-sections are variable between bars and for a single bar, and also over time. The surveys show a consistent northward migration of the bars at a mean rate of about 2 m/month, but the rate is larger in winter than in summer. The Lidar observations show that the tidal inlet, located at the southern limit of the bar field where the bars start forming, comprises a large sediment platform that acts as a source of sand for the bars. The ebb jet debouching from the inlet is deflected northward by the ambient strong shore-parallel tidal currents in this large tide-range setting, and this may be the primary mechanism leading to the emplacement of the bars. Smaller wave-formed swash bars that further feed the development of these large transverse bars have also been observed. Monitoring of bar migration in the course of six consecutive spring tides with fair-weather conditions showed that strong spring tidal currents are sufficient to <b>drive</b> <b>bar</b> mobility in the absence of waves. Storm wave resuspension of sand is thus expected to enhance bar mobility rates, as shown by the higher rates of winter bar migration compared to the summer rates. The ebb jet explains the slower bar migration rates at the vicinity of the inlet, these rates increasing with distance northward of the inlet as the tidal currents become unimpeded. The main difference between these macrotidal transverse bars and their counterparts in microtidal settings resides in these strong tidal currents that are the essential driver of bar migration, unlike the wave-driven migration of microtidal bars. The large tidal range, in conjunction with storm wave activity, also induces longshore and seasonal variability in bar morphology. The transverse bars of Normandy appear to be inscribed in a sand circulation system involving the west Cotentin coast, the large ebb tidal delta from which they are formed, and the central Cotentin embayment where they are ultimately incorporated into the nearshore sand pool. Longer-term field hydrodynamic monitoring and modelling will be required in order to further elucidate the mode of formation of these transverse bars...|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasing}} requirements on speed and accuracy in current day manipulators, flexibility effects have become important. In this paper, the flexural dynamics of a parallel <b>drive</b> five <b>bar</b> manipulator are studied. The parallel <b>drive</b> five <b>bar</b> configuration {{is a very}} attractive design due to its considerably simplified rigid body dynamics. Specifically, the equations of motion for an inertia invariant five bar manipulator are given {{by a pair of}} linear time invariant (LTI) differential equations. This permits application of existing single axis servo control techniques to the control of such a manipulator. Besides, strategies such as direct drive actuation, etc., are also easily implemented. These lead to increased accuracy, better control performance and less uncertainty. It is shown in this paper that the simplicity afforded to the rigid body dynamics of the parallel <b>drive</b> five <b>bar</b> configuration also extends to its flexural dynamics. The elastic vibrations of the manipulator are also modeled by a set of linear time invariant differential equations. Also, when (invariant) modal coordinates are used to model the elastic vibrations, it is seen that the number of equations representing the flexural dynamics of the manipulator equals the number of modes under consideration. For the five bar example presented in this paper, only three modes were found to be significant. Thus, the overall dynamics of the manipulator (rigid body and flexural) is represented by a set of five decoupled linear time invariant differential equations. Such a model does not involve any more approximation than that of ignoring higher modes. Thus, this permits real time control of the manipulator based on an accurate linear time invariant model.

The transmission cooler mount, new brakes and drums were also installed Modifications to the EV were completed by March 2000. The EV was tested for several weeks before completing the installation of the CNG system. Once the CNG system was operation, tests were done on the HEV.
