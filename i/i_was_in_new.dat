[...] "As the Colonel is my most important client, I must be at the office in case of developments or a sudden demand for my services.

60|$|You can't beat these rural charmers. They think New York {{is folded}} {{up and put}} away in camphor when they leave, and only taken out again when they pay their next visit.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York when I {{received}} {{the order to}} proceed immediately to Chicago. The man who gave me the order {{was one of the}} oligarchs, I could tell that by his speech, though I did not know his name nor see his face. His instructions were too clear for me to make a mistake. Plainly I read between the lines that our plot had been discovered, that we had been countermined. The explosion was ready for the flash of powder, and countless agents of the Iron Heel, including me, either on the ground or being sent there, were to supply that flash. I flatter myself that I maintained my composure under the keen eye of the oligarch, but my heart was beating madly. I could almost have shrieked and flown at his throat with my naked hands before his final, cold-blooded instructions were given.|$|E
6000|$|A sort of propagandist enthusiasm {{grew up in}} the men. They felt it {{incumbent}} upon them to persuade the Traffords to return. They reasoned with them rather as one does with wilful children. They tried to remind them of the delights and securities of the world they were deserting. Noyes drew fancy pictures of the pleasures of London by way of contrast to the bitter days before them. [...] "You've got everything there, everything. Suppose you feel a bit ill, you go out, and every block there's a drug store got everything--all the new rem'dies--p'raps twenty, thirty sorts of rem'dy. Lit up, nice.

When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York, I became acquainted with a German surgeon, who had made a reputation and a fortune in America by his skill in treating diseases of the eye. He had been especially successful in curing cases of blindness given up as hopeless by other surgeons. I mentioned your case to him. He could say nothing positively (as a matter of course) without examining you. All {{he could do was}} to place his services at my disposal, when he came to England. I for one, Lucilla, decline to consider you blind for life, until this skillful man sees no more hope for you than the English surgeons have seen. If there is the faintest chance still left of restoring your sight, his is, I firmly believe, the one hand that can do it. He is now in England. Say the word--and I will bring him to Dimchurch." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} I seek {{to answer}} is not about explaining support or resistance to the globalization or harmonization of IP rights.

Explaining the globalization or harmonization of already-existing IP rights is an important task, but fundamentally different than explaining why some things became intellectual property in the first place...|$|R
