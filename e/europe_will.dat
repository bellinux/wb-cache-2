The Harbin to Hamburg 15-day train journey {{will add to}} over-land freight capacity and increase transportation redundancy. China is already moving freight by rail to Europe from Chongqing, Chengdu, Changsha, Hefei, Yiwu and Suzhou.

25|$|In October 2015, Tesla {{announced}} {{the company is}} negotiating with the Chinese government on producing its electric cars domestically.

Production in <b>Europe</b> <b>will</b> also depend on the region's demand for the Model 3.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of freight shipments between the EU, Russia and the Asian Pacific Region currently go by sea via the Suez Canal – a distance of between 17,000 and 22,000km. By extending the broad-gauge line, the promoters of the Košice–Vienna project aim to make the Trans-Siberian Railway more competitive vis-à-vis the sea routes. By eliminating the need to change bogies, freight delivery times from East Asia to <b>Europe</b> <b>will</b> be cut by 14 days to just half of the time required for transportation by sea. And as {{there will be no}} freight transshipment the risk of accidental damage to cargo could be reduced. Russian Railways CEO Vladimir Yakunin believes it is the faster freight delivery that will make the project competitive.|$|E

25|$|When hunting, the wildcat patrols {{forests and}} along forest {{boundaries}} and glades. In favourable conditions, it will readily feed in fields. The wildcat will pursue prey atop trees, even jumping from one branch to another. On the ground, {{it lies in}} wait for prey, then catches it by executing a few leaps, which can span three metres. Sight and hearing are the wildcat's primary senses when hunting, its sense of smell being comparatively weak. When hunting aquatic prey, such as ducks or nutrias, the wildcat waits on trees overhanging the water. It kills small prey by grabbing it in its claws, and piercing the neck or occiput with its fangs. When attacking large prey, the wildcat leaps upon the animal's back, and attempts to bite the neck or carotid. It does not persist in attacking if prey manages to escape it. Wildcats hunting rabbits have been observed to wait above rabbit warrens for their prey to emerge. Although primarily a solitary predator, the wildcat {{has been known to}} hunt in pairs or in family groups, with each cat devoted entirely to listening, stalking, or pouncing. While wildcats in <b>Europe</b> <b>will</b> cache their food, such a behaviour has not been observed in their African counterparts.|$|E
500|$|Capelle was {{promoted}} to konteradmiral (rear admiral) in 1906, and to vizeadmiral (vice admiral) three years later. In 1912, Capelle was elevated to the nobility, which allowed him to add [...] "von" [...] to his name. He rose {{to the rank of}} admiral in 1913, and by 1914, he was Tirpitz's deputy. During the July Crisis that instigated World War I, Capelle was temporarily the acting state secretary, as Tirpitz was away at his summer home. In this capacity, he endorsed the [...] "blank check" [...] Kaiser Wilhelm II had extended to Austria-Hungary {{in the aftermath of the}} assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbian terrorists the previous month. With regard to the deepening crisis, Capelle stated that while [...] "many swords will be rattled and much poisonous ink spilled, <b>Europe</b> <b>will</b> not tear itself to pieces over Serbia.|$|E
500|$|Firstly, it was {{intended}} to prevent further war between France and Germany and other states by tackling the root cause of war. The ECSC was primarily conceived with France and Germany in mind: [...] "The coming together of the nations of Europe requires the elimination of the age-old opposition of France and Germany. Any action taken must in the first place concern these two countries." [...] The coal and steel industries being essential for the production of munitions, Schuman believed that by uniting these two industries across France and Germany under an innovative supranational system that also included a European anti-cartel agency, he could [...] "make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible". Schuman had another aim: [...] "With increased resources <b>Europe</b> <b>will</b> be able to pursue the achievement of one of its essential tasks, namely, the development of the African continent." [...] Industrial cartels tended to impose [...] "restrictive practices" [...] on national markets, whereas the ECSC would ensure the increased production necessary for their ambitions in Africa.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1934, Smuts told an {{audience}} at the Royal Institute of International Affairs that:How can the inferiority complex which is obsessing and, I fear, poisoning the mind, and indeed the very soul of Germany, be removed? There {{is only one way}} and that is to recognise her complete equality of status with her fellows and to do so frankly, freely and unreservedly ... While one understands and sympathises with French fears, one cannot, but feel for Germany in the prison of inferiority in which she still remains sixteen years after the conclusion of the war. The continuance of the Versailles status is becoming an offence to the conscience of Europe and a danger to future peace ... Fair play, sportsmanship—indeed every standard of private and public life—calls for frank revision of the situation. Indeed ordinary prudence makes it imperative. Let us break these bonds and set the complexed-obsessed soul free in a decent human way and <b>Europe</b> <b>will</b> reap a rich reward in tranquility, security and returning prosperity.|$|E

[...] "The Islamic Republic’s policy of constructive interaction with the world and breaking up nuclear sanctions, has placed Iran’s economic ties with all countries on an improving and irreversible course."
