25|$|The WeatherStar systems also utilize a Lower <b>Display</b> <b>Line</b> (LDL) {{that appears}} {{at the bottom of}} the screen during all {{programming}} (until November 2013, it had been limited to only local forecasts and national programming, while being removed from the screen during commercial breaks), providing current conditions for a specific location and two or three towns within 15 miles, almanac data and forecasts on cable headends using the IntelliStar system, and only current conditions and forecasts on cable headends using STAR models from WeatherStar XL and older. WeatherStar units also allow cable providers to scroll text messages when in use, including the capability to broadcast severe weather advisories and warnings in effect for the jurisdiction in which the WeatherStar system's cable headend is located and its immediate surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|The channel {{originally}} {{featured a}} lower <b>display</b> <b>line</b> (LDL) {{similar to that}} seen on TWC at the bottom one-tenth of the screen, to display continuous weather information and inform viewers of current and forthcoming segments in tab form (the tab highlighting the segment being aired at the time cycled between the segment's title and a countdown clock). The national feed's LDL showed current conditions (denoting the sky condition, and cycling through the temperature, wind data and if applicable, apparent temperature) and daypart forecasts for 20 major U.S. cities, and the current time in all four time zones in the Contiguous U.S. The localized versions – which were keyed over the national LDL – cycled through current conditions and forecasts for cities within proximity of the metropolitan area, with the time bar corresponding to the local time zone. As part of a graphical overhaul on February 20, 2017, the LDL {{was replaced by a}} progress bar counting down the runtime of the current segment, which had previously appeared atop the LDL.|$|E

2500|$|After December 2009, these weekly {{movies were}} {{discontinued}} {{for the time}} being in favor of running Weather Center, which already aired throughout primetime {{during the rest of the}} work week. Despite the controversy, the Friday night film block resumed on March 26, 2010 under the title [...] "Flick and a Forecast," [...] co-hosted by The Weather Channel meteorologist Jen Carfagno and MSNBC contributor Touré, with the documentary [...] During the broadcasts, the Lower <b>Display</b> <b>Line</b> that normally appears on TWC shows to provide local weather information (with breakaways during forecast and most long-form programs only for commercial breaks) was removed, appearing only a few times each hour during the film as a substitute for the standard [...] "Local on the 8s" [...] segments, with a translucent TWC logo bug appearing at other times during the film when the LDL was not on-screen.|$|E
2500|$|The Weather Channel also {{broadcasts}} original weather-related documentary/entertainment {{series and}} specials. These programs run from 8:00p.m. to 5:00a.m. Eastern Time on weekdays and 12:00p.m. to 5:00a.m. Eastern Time {{on weekends and}} holidays (they also run from 12:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Mondays). During severe weather events affecting portions of the United States, The Weather Channel may preempt original programming in favor of airing special extended editions of Weather Center Live (which move {{the color of the}} word [...] "LIVE" [...] from blue to red) to provide long-form coverage and analysis until it stops; in some events, the on-air graphics (including Lower <b>Display</b> <b>Line)</b> can go black-and-red (similar to colors that WCL uses); pre-emptions vary between local (isolated to viewers in the region affected by a particular weather event) and nationwide, depending upon the impact of the weather phenomenon/story and if a local provider utilizes a later model WeatherStar unit that allows the use of dual feeds that can substitute programming with long-form weather coverage in a given area. And also, during all of these events, the jingles that WCL uses is used to replace the normal one on Local on the 8's.|$|E

2500|$|The channel's {{original}} format was akin {{to that of}} a {{news and}} information cable network. Since the creation of the series Atmospheres in 2000 and Storm Stories in 2003, The Weather Channel had seen a gradual transition toward a mix of weather forecast programming and weather-related entertainment programming that paralleled the launch of sister network Weatherscan, the evolution of the always-on [...] "L" [...] bar/weather ticker, the development of weather.com and popular branded mobile phone applications, and the increased viewing and interest in documentary programs on the topic of weather. In November 2013, the channel introduced a new initiative of [...] "weather all the time" [...] in response to the criticism; all original programming – which was rebranded under the tagline Natural Drama – now had direct relevance to weather-related subjects, and the network reemphasized its promise to interrupt original programming either regionally or nationally during major weather events; in addition, The Weather Channel extended the display of its lower <b>display</b> <b>line</b> (which also experienced a design revamp as part of the introduction of a new graphics package) to commercial breaks and through entire broadcasts of its original programs.|$|E

50|$|The Weather Star systems also utilize weather {{information}} {{in the form of}} a Lower <b>Display</b> <b>Line</b> (LDL); the LDL displayed by Weather Star systems from Weather Star Jr. and earlier were strictly text-based, and therefore contained no graphical background, and also only included current weather observations and monthly precipitation totals.|$|E

50|$|It was not {{possible}} to define new mathematical function commands for use in Run mode. However, on many Sharp derived models, a special AREAD command was added to BASIC which would assign the current value on the <b>display</b> <b>line</b> to a given variable, which could then be used in a program. Combined with a defined key, this allowed very quick custom operation.|$|E
5000|$|In {{recent years}} with the {{inclusion}} of original programming such as Storm Stories and Full Force Nature to The Weather Channel, the local forecasts began airing only for four times an hour during long-form entertainment-based programs and some forecast programming on the channel. Local weather information was provided during the other [...] "8"s on the Lower <b>Display</b> <b>Line</b> during these programs. The standard [...] "Local on the 8s" [...] segment airs during non-forecast programming once every half-hour; until November 11, 2013, at about :18 and :48 minutes of each hour, an L-bar displaying localized weather observations and forecasts aired during a live national forecast update performed {{by one of the}} channel's on-camera meteorologists, running in a simultaneous picture-in-picture format. On November 12, 2013, The Weather Channel began to display the Lower <b>Display</b> <b>Line</b> full-time, throughout commercial breaks and telecasts of its long-form programs (prior to the change, commercials were broadcast full-screen and the LDL appeared during long-form programs on an intermittent basis).|$|E
50|$|The editor, {{like many}} text editors, is a full-screen editor; {{a window into}} the file being edited is <b>displayed</b> and the <b>lines</b> <b>displayed</b> can be edited {{directly}} on-screen by insertions, deletions, or overtyping. Editing is also effected by pressing programmable action keys or by typing in commands. Commands are either 'top-line commands' (entered in a command entry area on the top line of the screen) or 'line commands' (entered in a 4-character command entry field adjacent to each <b>displayed</b> <b>line</b> of text).|$|R
50|$|Horizontal scan rate, or {{horizontal}} frequency, usually {{expressed in}} kilohertz, is the frequency {{at which a}} CRT moves the electron beam {{from the left side}} of the display to the right and back, and therefore describes the number of horizontal <b>lines</b> <b>displayed</b> per second. CRT timings include some horizontal scans before the visible display, after it, and during the travel from bottom to top (known as vertical back porch, vertical front porch, and vertical sync width, respectively, and collectively known as vertical blank time), so the horizontal scan rate does not directly correlate to visible <b>display</b> <b>lines,</b> unless the unseen lines are also known, but it can still be used to approximate the <b>display</b> <b>lines,</b> as the total blank time is usually a small but significant portion of the total lines.|$|R

50|$|Two timing {{intervals}} {{are defined}} - {{the front porch}} {{between the end of}} displayed video and the start of the sync pulse, and the back porch after the sync pulse and before displayed video. These and the sync pulse itself are called the horizontal blanking (or retrace) interval and represent the time that the electron beam in the CRT is returning {{to the start of the}} next <b>display</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
50|$|TRON also existed as the TRON {{command in}} the early {{versions}} of the computer programming language BASIC. TRON stood for TRace ON, which prompted the program to print or <b>display</b> <b>line</b> numbers for each command line of a program as it ran, in order {{to assist in the}} debugging of the program. In the TRON film, TRON became a character who worked in programs to defeat evil elements trying to subvert the program.|$|E
50|$|Combining the Map and Character Mode {{instructions}} {{with the}} LMS bit {{makes it possible}} to set the screen memory address freely within the 64K address space independently for each <b>display</b> <b>line.</b> In other words, the screen memory {{does not have to be}} completely contiguous memory scanned sequentially towards higher addresses - only that a single Mode line must be provided with adequate sequential bytes of memory to meet the requirements of that Mode, width of the display, and Scrolling feature.|$|E
