5000|$|Considering light {{which is}} {{scattered}} {{only once in}} the atmosphere, the light received by the instrument at surface is contributed by light scattered downward from all the levels in the atmosphere. The amount of light contributed by scattering at any particular level depends on (a) the number of air molecules at that level and (b) the absorption by ozone and scattering by air moleculaes {{both before and after}} scattering. As the height increases contribution of effect (a) decreases and contribution of effect (b) increases. For a given zenith angle, the scattered light contribution comes from well defined layer of atmosphere, which can be termed as an <b>effective</b> scattering <b>height.</b> The <b>effective</b> scattering <b>height</b> depends on the ozone absorption coefficient and on the solar zenith angle, increasing as with each of these. The <b>effective</b> scattering <b>height</b> will always be higher for shorter wavelength which is more strongly absorbed. As the sun approaches the horizon, the two intensities decreases, but intensity I decreasing more rapidly than I [...] However, when the <b>effective</b> scattering <b>height</b> for the short wavelength is above the ozone maximum, I decreases more slowly than I , because the ozone absorption occurs mostly in the shorter vertical path after the scattering event, and the ratio I/I increases until the <b>effective</b> scattering <b>height</b> for I [...] is also above the ozone maximum. This reversal (Umkehr) or inversion implies the existence of maximum of ozone concentration at some level in the atmosphere.|$|R

In addition, the technique can be used to make highly localized electronic measurements of surfaces, adsorbates, and molecules in the tunnel gap. Such measurements, generally known as scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), can probe either the electronic density of states or the <b>effective</b> barrier <b>height.</b> Studying the effects of solvent on the <b>effective</b> barrier <b>height</b> is particularly interesting, since that is a direct measure of the bridging capacity of the solvent and has analogs in heterogeneous electron transfer and electron transfer in proteins and frozen glasses.

40|$|Extensive studies characterizing Titan {{present an}} {{opportunity}} to study the atmospheric properties of Titan-like exoplanets. Using an existing model of Titan's atmospheric haze, we computed geometric albedo spectra and <b>effective</b> transit <b>height</b> spectra for six values of the haze production rate (zero haze to twice present) {{over a wide range}} of wavelengths (0. 2 - 2 microns). In the geometric albedo spectra, the slope in the UV-visible changes from blue to red when varying the haze production rate values from zero to twice the current Titan value. This spectral feature is {{the most effective way to}} characterize the haze production rates. Methane absorption bands in the visible-NIR compete with the absorbing haze, being more prominent for smaller haze production rates. The <b>effective</b> transit <b>heights</b> probe a region of the atmosphere where the haze and gas are optically thin and that is thus not effectively probed by the geometric albedo. The <b>effective</b> transit <b>height</b> decreases smoothly with increasing wavelength, from 376 km to 123 km at 0. 2 and 2 microns, respectively. When decreasing the haze production rate, the methane absorption bands become more prominent, and the <b>effective</b> transit <b>height</b> decreases with a steeper slope with increasing wavelength. The slope of the geometric albedo in the UV-visible increases smoothly with increasing haze production rate, while the slope of the <b>effective</b> transit <b>height</b> spectra is not sensitive to the haze production rate other than showing a sharp rise when the haze production rate increases from zero. We conclude that geometric albedo spectra provide the most sensitive indicator of the haze production rate and the background Rayleigh gas. Our results suggest that important and complementary information can be obtained from the geometric albedo and motivates improvements in the technology for direct imaging of nearby exoplanets...|$|R
40|$|Finite element (FE) {{simulations}} of lateral loading tests on a full-scale masonry wall with an opening were processed {{to investigate the}} observed rocking response before and after strengthening. The lateral drift of the piers and spandrel panel was decomposed in a part associated with both bending and shear deformations and another part associated with rocking rotations of end sections. FE analysis results show that: (1) the ratio between rocking rotations of the spandrel panel {{and those of the}} piers can be predicted through a simple geometrical relationship; (2) overturning moment can induce significant axial force variations in piers, changing their lateral behaviour. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that rocking response was not significantly affected by variations in fracture energies of masonry units and mortar, opposed to the case of individual solid masonry walls. Finally, a simplified analysis of individual piers and macro-element matrix analysis of the as-built sub-assemblage was performed. Several options in terms of pier <b>effective</b> <b>heights,</b> spandrel <b>effective</b> length, size/stiffness of spandrel-pier overlapping zones, and reduction of elastic properties have been tested against experimental and numerical results.
