Consequently, billions of dollars are invested every year in marketing and advertisement strategies {{with the intention of}} influencing the behavior of consumers. However, much of the invested effort and money is wasted on poor marketing ploys which quickly exhaust opportunities to convince consumers to buy their products. There might be many reasons for this failure, which range from the <b>improper</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> emotions (E), celebrity endorsements (C) and supporting appeal drivers (A) in the advertisements. Apart from the industry perspective, the right choice of audience and their gender can determine the success magnitude of the EAs, which ultimately turns into market share maximization.

40|$|A temperature-programmed {{reduction}} (TPR) {{study of}} CuO, Cu 2 O, and Cuo-ZnO catalysts, in the atomic range Cu:Zn = 92 : 8 to 67 : 33, is reported. In {{order to promote}} a correct experimental approach, much attention {{has been devoted to}} the choice of the experimental operating variables. Direct evidence is presented that the reduction profiles of the investigated specimens are markedly affected by artefacts when TPR measurements are carried out under conditions <b>of</b> an inadequate <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> initial amount of reducible species, total flow rate, initial hydrogen concentration, and heating rate. It is shown that under correct experimental conditions the reduction profile of each sample is characterized by a single and quite sharp reduction peak. In contrast to this, a dramatic change of shape occurs when an <b>improper</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the experimental operating variables is imposed: for both CuO and Cu 2 O an apparent double peak appears, whereas for the CuO-ZnO catalysts the reduction profiles are transformed into broad bands. In all cases, the reliability of the TPR results is completely lost. To explain the complex origin of these artefacts, it is suggested that both a special dynamic situation and activated H- 2 adsorption-desorption phenomena coinciding with the chemical reduction are responsible for the observed perturbations. A simple kinetic analysis has been developed which enables a qualitative reproduction of the disturbed reduction profiles to be made. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc...|$|R

40|$|A {{database}} on shape {{evolution of}} direct N-body models formed out of cold, dissipationless collapse is generated using GRAPE and HARP special purpose computers. Such models {{are important to}} understand the formation of elliptical galaxies. Three dynamically distinct phases of shape evolution were found, first a fast dynamical collapse which gives rise to the radial orbit instability (ROI) and generates at its end the maximal triaxiality of the system. Subsequently, two phases of violent and two-body shape relaxation occur, which drive the system first towards axisymmetry, finally to spherical symmetry (the final state, however, is still much more concentrated than the initial model). In a sequence of models the influence of numerical and physical parameters, like particle number, softening, initial virial ratio, timestep choice, different N-body codes, are examined. We find that an <b>improper</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> softening and particle number can produce erroneous results. Selected models were evolved on the secular timescale until they became spherically symmetric again. The secular shape relaxation time scale is shown to agree very well with the two-body relaxation time, if softening is properly taken into account for the latter. Finally, we argue, that the intermediate phase of violent shape relaxation after collapse is induced by strong core oscillations in the centre, which cause potential fluctuations, dampening out the triaxiality.
