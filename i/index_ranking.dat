25|$|Cantonese merchants (Jyutping: Jyut6 soeng1; Traditional Chinese: 粵商) are merchants of Cantonese origins. In {{the past}} two {{thousands}} years, Lingnan (especially the area around Gwongzau) {{has spent much of}} the time being the Chinese Empire's main port, resulting in a strong commercial tradition, formation of renowned Cantonese trade organizations such as the Canton Factories, and even Cantonese developing their own business culture: Cantonese merchants are known for being pragmatic, preference for actual profits over fame, and avoidance of political matters and display of wealth. Nowadays, Cantonese people still inherit this commercial culture. Major Lingnan cities such as Gwongzau, Futsan, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong are regional (if not international) commercial centers. Hong Kong, for instance, scored 748 in 2016's Global Financial Centres <b>Index,</b> <b>ranking</b> fourth in the world and just below London and New York city.|$|E

2500|$|Following the Yom Kippur War Israeli defense {{spending}} rose dramatically, exposing {{the weaknesses of}} the state-run economy. The result was rampant inflation that led Israel to recall the lira in 1980 and issue the sheqel. This move did not sufficiently curb inflation and consequently the sheqel was recalled in 1985 in favor for the Israeli new sheqel, a move implemented together with a comprehensive economic stabilization program which stemmed inflation {{and set the stage}} for high growth in the 1990s. Israel had also undertaken a privatization effort beginning in the late 1970s. The economy received a boost in the early 1990s with the arrival of several hundred thousand immigrants form the former Soviet Union. As a significant number of the immigrants were highly educated, Israel accelerated its privatization in order to encourage the high-skilled workers to stay. The new high-skill labor also attracted a lot of foreign direct investment. Israel's growth over the past decade has been commensurate with western developed nations as is its GDP (PPP) per-capita which is about $35,000/year – the highest of all the non natural resources dependent countries in the Middle East. It also has the highest economic complexity index of all the countries in the Middle East.
