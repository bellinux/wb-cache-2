Since a young age, he has placed the well-being of others before his own and dislikes seeing people in sorrow. Since he lost his parents in his childhood, he has been living with Kaede Fuyou, a life envied by many of his classmates. One of the heroines of Shuffle!, Kaede believes it her duty {{in life is to}} take care of Rin, which she takes upon herself in order to atone for her treatment of him in the past and bears a one-sided love towards Rin. Kaede appears again as the heroine <b>in</b> <b>Really?</b> Really!, a sequel to Shuffle!, that continues from Kaede's ending in Shuffle!. In middle school, the two meet and later befriend Asa Shigure, another heroine of Shuffle! who is in her third-year of high school. While she has a weak constitution, she makes up for it with her energetic tomboy personality and is an excellent cook. She has a habit of slapping Rin on his back.|$|E

25|$|The roadway {{that would}} later become Tiorati Brook Road dates back to records from a map of Rockland County in 1839 by David Barr. Known as the Cedar Ponds Road, the road was {{acquired}} by the county in 1899, and in 1907, when {{a report to the}} county was made, the route was <b>in</b> <b>really</b> poor condition for their roads. Topographical maps dating as far back as 1910 show Tiorati Brook Road as a local road reaching as far east as what is today the intersection of Gate Hill Road (Rockland CR106) and Cedar Falls Road (CR69), east of the Palisades Interstate Parkway.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} on creating believable video game characters, Bungie's Joseph Staten noted that, [...] "Master Chief is really what kicked off the creativity," [...] he said, [...] "in terms of how people react to him. He's a space Marine <b>in</b> <b>really</b> cool green armor." [...] The character's perspective changed as the game itself changed from a real-time strategy game to a first-person shooter, but the Chief was always {{intended to be a}} soldier in the last part of a long and bitter war. For much of the game's development, the character had no name. The developers spent time considering what rank and branch of the armed forces the Chief would belong to—naval ranks grabbed them as [...] "different" [...] from ones the developers had heard of before. [...] "Master Chief" [...] was intended to be a placeholder while a real name was finalized, but the moniker stuck.|$|E
500|$|After {{playing at}} a few gigs with Deftones in California, United States, Korn {{went back to the}} studio to start {{recording}} Life Is Peachy in April 1996. Korn asked Ross Robinson to produce, and wanted to begin recording at Indigo Ranch, mostly because their first album had been recorded there and was a success. Authors Jason Arnopp and Doug Small, insisted the album was rushed when it was put together. Silveria explained, [...] "We went <b>in</b> <b>really</b> fresh, and we wanted to get it done quickly to capture that moment. So it was probably about sixty percent knowing what I was going to play and forty percent just playing whatever came to mind at that moment, It ended up really good, and it has a kind of energy I probably wouldn't have gotten if I'd worked everything out beforehand." [...] Korn's bassist Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu said, [...] "We wanted that same energy and inspiration we found up in the Malibu Hills." ...|$|E
500|$|Following relegation {{from the}} Premier League {{at the end}} of the 2010–11 season, Barry Ferguson and Lee Bowyer left the club, giving Fahey the chance to {{establish}} himself in his preferred central position. After recovering from hernia surgery early in the 2011–12 season, he partnered Jonathan Spector in a solid midfield supporting two attacking wide players. Later in the season, he played a defensive support role alongside the more attacking Jordon Mutch, and manager Chris Hughton suggested he was [...] "enjoying playing in that central role and he's enjoying the development he's had there all season". When he suffered a groin problem that caused him to miss the last few weeks of the season, Hughton called it [...] "a real blow for us... because he's a player that has been <b>in</b> <b>really</b> good form". He scored four goals during the season, including [...] "a venomous left-foot drive from 20 yards" [...] at Barnsley and a goal he [...] "couldn't have hit... any sweeter first time, or with any more power" [...] at home to Crystal Palace that earned him the club's Goal of the Season award.|$|E

500|$|LeMond grew {{up living}} an active, outdoor life. Hiking, hunting, skiing and flyfishing were boyhood pastimes. The ranch country [...] of the Sierra Nevada {{mountain}} range lent itself to such pursuits. A hyperactive youngster, LeMond believes these outdoor activities helped {{keep him out}} of trouble. [...] "I was a boy who just could not sit still. I had trouble focusing in school. Parents and educators then did not have the skill set to diagnose and cope with what we know now was a classic case of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD certainly was not the frequently medicated childhood disease it is today. My triumph over the symptoms was found atop two thin tires over many dusty miles." [...] Said LeMond: [...] "That's one of the traits. It's the inability to sit down [...] to something you are not really interested in and absorb it. If they are interested in it, people with ADD excel <b>in</b> <b>really</b> good ways. When I got into cycling I would say the sport itself took a fog off my brain. I was able to absorb stuff I read. It changed my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, {{commonly}} referred to as simply the Master Chief, is the main protagonist and main playable character in the Halo trilogy. The character is voiced by Steve Downes, a Chicago disc jockey. One of the last SPARTAN-II supersoldiers still in active service (one of the few survivors of the Fall of Reach), the Master Chief inspires awe and fear in the alien Covenant, who refer to him as (a) [...] "Demon". Assisted by the artificial intelligence Cortana, he prevents the firing of Installation 04 in Halo: Combat Evolved, an event which the player is told would have destroyed all sentient life in the galaxy. Bungie staff member Joseph Staten noted that until the Master Chief was created, Bungie had not paid any attention to how to make people want to play in the world. [...] "Master Chief is really what kicked off the creativity," [...] he said, [...] "in terms of how people react to him. He's a space marine <b>in</b> <b>really</b> cool green armor." [...] The character has since become a gaming icon, the mascot of the Xbox, and was rated {{as one of the greatest}} videogame characters of all time by Electronic Gaming Monthly.|$|E
500|$|Azaria played Gargamel in the computer-animated/live-action {{adaptation}} of The Smurfs (2011). Azaria wore a prosthetic nose, ears, buck teeth, eyebrows and a wig, {{as well as}} shaving his head. He spent approximately 130 hours in the make-up chair {{over the course of}} the production. Azaria considered Gargamel's voice to be the most important part of his performance. The producers wanted an [...] "old, failed, Shakespearean actor" [...] voice, but Azaria felt this would lack energy and wanted something more Eastern European. He eventually selected a voice similar to that of Paul Winchell's from the cartoon. Azaria disliked the cartoon when it first aired, and considered Gargamel too one-dimensional a character and [...] "just this straight villain"; he opted to make Gargamel [...] "more sarcastic" [...] than in the cartoon, but [...] "discovered that there's no way to play Gargamel without screaming your head off at certain points – ramping him up and getting him very upset over Smurfs". He interpreted him as [...] "very lonely", adding that [...] "he hates the Smurfs because they're such a happy family. He wants <b>in</b> <b>really</b> badly. I think he wants to be embraced as a Smurf". Azaria worked with the writers to [...] "infuse" [...] the script with some of his ideas about the character, [...] "particularly with the 'married' relationship between Gargamel and [...] Azreal [...] " [...] which Azaria conceived.|$|E

500|$|Sveriges Radio {{stipulated that}} the work had to include a Swedish element. Singer Russell Mael told The National, [...] "At first, we {{obviously}} thought of cars and Ikea. I'm joking. But the more profound, more lasting idea – being the film fans we are – was Ingmar Bergman. So we hit upon a fantasy situation of him going to Hollywood, which is obviously a lot more universal, too." [...] Before starting work on the musical, the Mael brothers decided to refresh their memories by looking at Bergman's films again. [...] "We were both really big film fans in university. At that time unless you only liked foreign film, and hated American ones, you weren't cool", Ron Mael told The Times. [...] "There was a real kind of seriousness to [...] He actually addressed big things {{and was able to}} frame those <b>in</b> <b>really</b> pure, cinematic ways. Now those things are seen as being kind of pretentious. Everyone wants to be seen as though they don't care about the big issues." [...] Commenting on the suitability of Bergman as the topic of a musical, Russell Mael told a Swedish newspaper, [...] "In a way, he is the least appropriate person for a musical. We like the absurdity of it all. He was such a deep, intense person {{and the vast majority of}} his films are about really deep topics. But we did not want to ridicule him, we wanted to do something respectful that Bergman would have been able to appreciate." ...|$|E
