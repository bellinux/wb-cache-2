5|$|Peet {{decided to}} follow closely the dramatic, dark, and {{sinister}} tone of Kipling's book, {{which is about the}} struggles between animals and man. However, the film's writers decided to make the story more straightforward, as the novel is very episodic, with Mowgli <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> from the jungle to the Man-Village, and Peet felt that Mowgli returning to the Man-Village should be the ending for the film. Following suggestions, Peet also created two original characters: The human girl for which Mowgli falls in love, as the animators considered that falling in love would be the best excuse for Mowgli to leave the jungle; and Louie, king of the monkeys. Louie was a less comical character, enslaving Mowgli trying to get the boy to teach him to make fire. The orangutan would also show a plot point borrowed from The Second Jungle Book, gold and jewels under his ruins— after Mowgli got to the man village, a poacher would drag the boy back to the ruins in search for the treasure. Disney was not pleased with how the story was turning out, as he felt it was too dark for family viewing and insisted on script changes. Peet refused, and after a long argument, Peet left the Disney studio in January 1964.|$|E
5|$|While Margarito did not land {{a lot of}} punches, he {{remained}} the more engaged fighter in the sixth round. A left hook to the body had Cotto on the defensive early in the seventh round, but {{he was able to}} fend off additional difficulty. A right hand from Cotto slowed Margarito, but he returned with punches that forced Cotto to clinch. Margarito commanded the bulk of the round, throwing 130punches in the round according to Compubox. Cotto was advocated by his corner in between rounds to stay off the ropes. He obliged, providing lateral movement throughout the round but with approximately 30seconds left, Margarito was able to trap Cotto in a corner, but Cotto managed to escape. It was more of the same in the ninth round, with Cotto <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> between southpaw and conventional stance. Margarito continued charging ahead, although Cotto would counterpunch sufficiency to avoid Margarito. The same pattern applied as in the previous two rounds, with Margarito charging forward and Cotto using movement while anticipating chances to counterpunch. Margarito immediately concluded the gap in the final 15seconds, landing a left hook, left uppercut and right hand that had Cotto against the ropes. Halfway through the eleventh round, a left uppercut by Margarito left Cotto vulnerable as he took a knee after Margarito landed a right uppercut and two right hands. Cotto managed to get up, but he went down again, despite Margarito not landing another punch. The referee moved in to count, but Evangelista Cotto, Cotto's trainer and uncle, climbed onto the ring apron and threw in the towel. The official time of the stoppage was 2:05of round eleven.|$|E

5000|$|Certain {{types of}} {{transmissions}} can suffer other negative effects from reflected waves on a transmission line. Analog TV can experience [...] "ghosts" [...] from delayed signals bouncing <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> {{on a long}} line. FM stereo can also be affected and digital signals can experience delayed pulses leading to bit errors. Whenever the delay times for a signal <b>going</b> <b>back</b> down <b>and</b> then again up the line are comparable to the modulation time constants, effects occur. For this reason, these types of transmissions require a low SWR on the feedline, even if SWR induced loss might be acceptable and matching is done at the transmitter.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with bisimulation relations which do not only require related agents to simulate each others behavior {{in the direction of}} the arrows, but also to simulate each other when <b>going</b> <b>back</b> in history. First it is demonstrated that the <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> variant of strong bisimulation leads to the same equivalence as the ordinary notion of strong bisimulation. Then it is shown that the <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> variant of Milner's observation equivalence is different from (and finer than) observation equivalence. In fact we prove that it coincides with the branching bisimulation equivalence of Van Glabbeek & Weijland. Also the <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> variants of branching, ~ and delay bisimulation lead to branching bisimulation equivalence. The notion of <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> bisimulation moreover leads to characterizations of branching bisimulation in terms of abstraction homomorphisms and in terms of Hencessy-Milner logic with backward modalities. In our view these results support the claim that branching bisimulation is a natural and important notion. The notion of bisimulation relation has been introduced by PARK [18]. It leads to an equivalence on labelled transition systems which, in case image finiteness is assumed, coincides with the strong equivalence of ~IILNER [12].

25|$|Beutel rejoined WABC-TV on September 28, 1970 as Grimsby's co-anchor on Eyewitness News.

On January 6, 1975, Beutel was reassigned by ABC News and became the co-host (along with Stephanie Edwards) of a new morning show called AM America. This show, ABC's first attempt at a morning news program to compete with NBC's Today and CBS's combination of network news and Captain Kangaroo, lasted only eleven months on the air. AM America was replaced on November 3, 1975 by Good Morning America, originally anchored by David Hartman and Nancy Dussault. Beutel returned to WABC-TV and Eyewitness News, though he maintained a presence on the network as the anchor of its 15-minute late newscasts on Saturday and Sunday nights through the late 1970s.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} six months of World War II, Bowlby worked at a clinic in Canonbury in the child {{psychiatry}} unit. Later on in the war, Bowlby became a lieutenant colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps, where he conducted research on psychological methods of officer selection (which contributed to the creation of War Office Selection Boards) and where he came into contact with members of the Tavistock Clinic. Alongside his job in the Royal Army Medical Corps, Bowlby explained that he also worked for the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) during the months of May and June in 1940 where he dealt with tragic war neurosis cases. Additionally, the children that were being treated at the Canonbury clinic were evacuated to the child guidance clinic in Cambridge, due to the air raids from the War. Bowlby explained in an interview that he spent time <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> from Cambridge to London, where he would see patients in private. From this experience, Bowlby was able to work with several children at Cambridge that were evacuated from London and separated from their families and nannies. This actually extended his research interested on separation that he was focused on pre-war.|$|E
