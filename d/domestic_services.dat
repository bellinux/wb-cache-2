40|$|<b>Domestic</b> <b>service</b> {{historically}} in Mexico {{has been}} a major employer of women; in 1980, approximately one of every six working women was a private household worker. Private household employment is largely an urban occupation, and the nation 2 ̆ 7 s capital, Mexico City, has generated much of the demand for <b>domestic</b> <b>service.</b> As elsewhere in Latin America, most private household workers are young, single female migrants women from rural areas. ^ This study examines the history and present conditions of female <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> in the Mexico City metropolitan area. In so doing, it focuses on various interrelated questions. First, it attempts to establish the role of <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> in the process of Mexican development; it examines the economic, social, and political significance of this occupation. Secondly, this research addresses the relationship between <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> and social reproduction. Thirdly, it describes and analyzes female domestic workers 2 ̆ 7 socioeconomic origins and demographic characteristics, as well as their labor and general living conditions. Fourthly, the influence of these combined factors in the configuration of their consciousness and identity is a related area of research. Finally, the different policies and programs concerning <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> that have been formulated by the government, the Church, and the feminist Left are analyzed in terms of their goals, operation, and importance. ^ Given its objectives, this study draws upon historical and anthropological methodologies. Documentary and field research was carried out in the Mexico City area during various phases between 1977 and 1985. ^ The findings indicate that female <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> has declined in relative terms over the twentieth century.

5|$|The airline {{was founded}} by {{shipowner}} Ludvig G. Braathen and initially flew to destinations in Asia. The original fleet consisted of Douglas aircraft; these were first used for long-haul flights, but were gradually shifted for use in medium- and short-haul charter services. The airline started <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> in 1954, with all its scheduled routes flown domestically until 1987. However, it continued to fly charter services from both Norway and Sweden, mostly to the Mediterranean. For Norwegian routes, Braathens first used a fleet of Herons, which were replaced with the Fokker F27 from 1958. The airline became the launch customer of the Fokker F28 in 1969 and also took delivery of Boeing 737-200 aircraft. The jet aircraft were at first used for charter, but later also for <b>domestic</b> <b>services.</b> All later deliveries would consist of Boeing aircraft, and after 1977 Braathens operated only jets. Between 1986 and 1989 the airline operated only the 737-200. By 1994, {{they had all been}} replaced with 737-400 and -500. Braathens entered the Swedish internal market in 1997 by purchasing Transwede and Malmö Aviation. This gave the airline a wider range of aircraft, including the 737-700, Fokker 100 and BAe 146. The losses suffered under a price war with Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) and Color Air in 1998 and 1999 caused the airline to be taken over by the SAS Group in 2001. Braathens and SAS Norway merged to form SAS Braathens in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{destinations}} in Asia {{were served}} from 1949 to 1954. Then, Braathens became a domestic airline, {{and did not}} have international scheduled services again until 1987, except during part of 1960. From 1994, the airline market was deregulated, and Braathens was free to operate domestically and within the European Economic Area. In 1997, it bought Transwede and started <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> in Sweden, but these were terminated in 1999. The company merged with the Norwegian division of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) in 2004 to create SAS Braathens.|$|E
5|$|Braathens South American & Far East Airtransport A/S or Braathens SAFE {{was founded}} by {{ship-owner}} Ludvig G. Braathen in 1946. It started as a charter airline based at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen in Norway, flying to destinations in the Far East and in South America. At first the airline used Douglas DC-4s, and later also Douglas DC-3s. In 1948, the airline moved to Oslo Airport, Fornebu and started regular scheduled flights to the Far East. In 1952, the airline started cooperation with the Icelandic airline Loftleidir, where until 1960 the two airlines in cooperation flew flights to Reykjavík. <b>Domestic</b> <b>services</b> started in 1951, using de Havilland Herons on a route from Oslo to Stavanger via Tønsberg. Braathens SAFE also established at Stavanger Airport, Sola. A second route was started two years later to Trondheim.

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the issue of <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> in England and Wales between the years 1880 - 1914. The aim of this thesis is to clarify the reasons that caused the beginning of decline of <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> ahead of World War I. The thesis explains the way of hiring and firing servants, it describes their daily routine and advantages and disadvantages of this occupation, as well as the structure and hierarchy within household. The cardinal element in the recession of <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> was the change of society's perception towards servants regarding the gradual disconnection of salary and social rank. This phenomenon together with the gentry's unwillingness {{to keep up with the}} times inevitably led to gradual decadence of <b>domestic</b> <b>service.</b> WWI and the consequent rise of alternative job offers only speeded up this process...|$|R

The Domestic Workers Convention adopted by the International Labor Organization in 2011 provides a context for examining persistent constraints on change toward social recognition and equity. Difference between <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> workers and standard wage earners is analyzed in depth, and nine unsolved practicalities of <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> regulation in Portugal are examined in light of the recent international convention.

5|$|Following Norway {{joining the}} European Economic Area (EEA), the airline {{industry}} was deregulated, allowing any airline from any EEA member country to make domestic or international flights to Norway. However, by 1994 there was no available slots at Fornebu during the morning and evening rush hours, {{limiting the number of}} new routes that could be established. After the deregulation, Fornebu could not offer slots to new airlines, and SAS and Braathens could not establish as many competing routes as they wanted to. However, <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> were provided by both SAS and Braathens SAFE to Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim, Bodø, Harstad/Narvik, Tromsø and Longyearbyen. The remaining domestic airports were only served by the incumbent. In addition, Teddy Air offered services to Fagernes.|$|E

5|$|State-owned {{slaves were}} put to work in palaces, offices, workshops, stables, and {{sometimes}} state-owned agricultural fields, while privately owned slaves were employed in <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> and sometimes farming. However, {{the vast majority of}} non-independent farmers working for wealthy landowners were not hired laborers or slaves, but were landless peasants who paid rent as tenants. It might have been more economically feasible to maintain tenants instead of slaves, since slave masters were obligated to pay an annual poll tax of 240 coins for each slave they owned (the same rate merchants had to pay for their poll tax). Government slaves were not assigned to work in the government's monopolized industries over iron and salt (which lasted from Emperor Wu's reign until the beginning of Eastern Han). Privately owned slaves were usually assigned to kitchen duty while others fulfilled roles as armed bodyguards, mounted escorts, acrobats, jugglers, dancers, singers, and musicians.|$|E

5|$|Braathens SAFE {{started as}} a charter airline, flying {{predominantly}} to the Far East and South America. In 1949, the airline was granted a concession on the Far East route that was flown until 1954, using Douglas DC-4s. The main airport in Norway was Oslo Airport, Fornebu, and the main technical base was at Stavanger Airport, Sola. From 1952 to 1960, the airline cooperated on flights to Reykjavík with the Icelandic airline Loftleidir. Braathens SAFE started <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> in 1951, using de Havilland Herons on a route from Oslo via Tønsberg to Stavanger. Services from Oslo to Trondheim were introduced in 1953. This was supplemented with stops in Farsund and Kristiansand in 1955, and Hamar, Røros and Notodden the following year. However, with the delivery of the Fokker F-27s, many of the smaller airports were cut from the service. The airline started flying from Oslo to Ålesund and along the West Coast in 1958. During 1960, the airline flew a single season to Sandefjord and Aalborg, Denmark. Services to Bodø and Tromsø started in 1967, and Boeing 737-200s and Fokker F-28s were taken into use two years later. Kristiansund was added as a destination in 1970 and Molde two years later. The F-28s were retired in 1986, while services to Longyearbyen started the following year.|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 1953, Braathens SAFE {{applied to}} start a route from Oslo to Trondheim Airport, Lade. A trial permit was granted, and the first flight was made on 18 August. Because Lade had a grass runway, Trondheim Airport, Værnes was used during bad weather. SAS flew a morning flight from Oslo, while Braathens flew the morning route from Trondheim. In 1953, Braathens SAFE stated that to keep their 210 {{employees}} and fleet of one DC-4, one DC-3 and two Herons, {{they would have to}} receive future <b>domestic</b> <b>services,</b> to compensate for more than 90% of their revenue disappearing with the loss of the Far East route. In 1953, Braathens SAFE applied to fly five routes: Bardufoss – Alta – Kirkenes; Stavanger – Bergen – Trondheim (both with Herons); Tromsø – Alta – Hammerfest; Bodø – Harstad; and Bodø – Harstad – Tromsø (all with de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otters). The five routes would require NOK725,000 in annual subsidies. The concessions were granted to DNL, who allowed their partially owned subsidiary Widerøe to fly the sea routes.|$|E

Following {{the crash of}} this DC-3 on 10 February 1972, near Dhaka, during a test flight, two Fokker F27s belonging to Indian Airlines and supplied by the Indian government entered the fleet as a replacement. Shortly afterwards, additional capacity was provided with the incorporation of a Douglas DC-6, loaned by the World Council of Churches, which was in turn replaced with another Douglas DC-6, a DC-6B model leased from Troll-Air, to operate the Dhaka-Calcutta route. On 4 March 1972, Biman started its international operations with a weekly flight to London using a Boeing 707 chartered from British Caledonian. The short haul fleet was supplemented by a Fokker F27 from India on 3 March 1972; the aircraft was employed on a daily scheduled flight between Calcutta and Dhaka on 28 April 1972.
