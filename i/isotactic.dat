25|$|A Ziegler-Natta {{catalyst}} is able {{to restrict}} linking of monomer molecules to a specific regular orientation, either <b>isotactic,</b> when all methyl groups are positioned at the same side {{with respect to the}} backbone of the polymer chain, or syndiotactic, when the positions of the methyl groups alternate.

25|$|Tacticity {{describes}} the relative stereochemistry of chiral centers in neighboring structural units within a macromolecule. There are three types: <b>isotactic</b> (all substituents {{on the same}} side), atactic (random placement of substituents), and syndiotactic (alternating placement of substituents).|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} stereochemical {{relationship of}} consecutive phenyl groups determines the tacticity, {{which has an}} effect on various physical properties of the material. The diastereomer where all of the phenyl groups are on the same side is called <b>isotactic</b> polystyrene, which is not produced commercially.|$|E
25|$|Polypropylene is in {{many aspects}} similar to polyethylene, {{especially}} in solution behaviour and electrical properties. The additionally present methyl group improves mechanical properties and thermal resistance, while the chemical resistance decreases. The properties of polypropylene depend on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, crystallinity, type and proportion of comonomer (if used) and the isotacticity. In <b>isotactic</b> polypropylene, for example, the CH3 groups are oriented {{on one side of}} the carbon backbone. This creates a greater degree of crystallinity and results in a stiffer material that is more resistant to creep than both atactic polypropylene and polyethylene.|$|E

2500|$|Stevens {{was among}} the first to {{recognize}} the potential of combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening in the discovery of olefin polymerization catalysts. [...] Stevens’ work here led to an amazing hafnium-based catalyst family (few experts would have believed a hafnium complex would have the needed activity) that enables the polymerization of propylene to <b>isotactic</b> polymers and copolymers in a high temperature solution process. [...] In a series of papers and patents starting in 2002, Stevens, along with colleagues and collaborators, disclosed new catalysts which are non-conventional, counter-intuitive, subtle, and have an unprecedented stereoselectivity along with remarkable high temperature performance. [...] This discovery has led to another family of new propene-based polyolefins and a process for the large-scale production of new thermoplastic and elastomeric materials. The resulting polymers have been commercialized under the VERSIFY tradename.|$|E

50|$|Natta {{first used}} {{polymerization}} catalysts based on titanium chlorides to polymerize propylene and other 1-alkenes. He discovered that these polymers are crystalline materials and ascribed their crystallinity {{to a special}} feature of the polymer structure called stereoregularity. The concept of stereoregularity in polymer chains is illustrated in {{the picture on the}} left with polypropylene. Stereoregular poly(1-alkene) can be <b>isotactic</b> or syndiotactic depending on the relative orientation of the alkyl groups in polymer chains consisting of units −CH2−CHR−, like the CH3 groups in the figure. In the <b>isotactic</b> polymers, all stereogenic centers CHR share the same configuration. The stereogenic centers in syndiotactic polymers alternate their relative configuration. A polymer that lacks any regular arrangement in the position of its alkyl substituents (R) is called atactic. Both <b>isotactic</b> and syndiotactic polypropylene are crystalline, whereas atactic polypropylene, which can also be prepared with special Ziegler-Natta catalysts, is amorphous. The stereoregularity of the polymer is determined by the catalyst used to prepare it.|$|E
