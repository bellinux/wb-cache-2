To Jared's surprise, Shirin resumes B's lectures where he left off and claims that she is now B. Even more surprising, she begrudgingly continues to personally tutor Jared in B's philosophies, though she openly calls Jared stupid, not because he lacks the capacity to learn but because she has never seen a person [...] "with so much mental equipment being put to so little use." [...] Shirin's further teachings include the idea of a Law of Life, the concept that storytelling may be a genetic characteristic of humans, the promotion of animism, and the notion that totalitarian agriculture results in <b>ecological</b> <b>imbalance</b> and over-population, which themselves are rapidly leading to humankind's self-destruction. Jared begins to see how he cannot remain devout to his order and in agreement with B's teachings simultaneously.|$|E

The authorsâ€™ argue that agrarian reform is required for increasing productivity in agricultural, strengthening agribusiness, efficient utilization of natural resources, and improved code of conduct for the organizations involved in the business processes. Agricultural products need financing as well as proper marketing strategies and better value chain needs to be created. Bangladesh can sustain long run macroeconomic stabilization by reducing deficit between demand and supply and achieving economic progress, and reducing unemployment and mass poverty through proper development and implementation of agro-business strategies.

The composition of forests also exhibited some major changes, with an increase in the area of commercially important monoculture plantation species such as pine and khair, and a decline in the area of oak, broadleaved and bamboo which are facing a high anthropogenic pressure in meeting the livelihood demands of forest dependent communities. In time deforestation, forest degradation and <b>ecological</b> <b>imbalances</b> due to the changing forest species composition may inflict irreversible damages upon unstable and fragile mountain zones such as the Indian Himalayas.

40|$|Since 1984, China's rural-based {{non-agricultural}} sector (the Township Village, and Private enterprises - TVEs) {{has seen}} dynamic growth, underpinning the rapid improvement in livelihood of some {{hundreds of millions}} of rural dwellers. Within the rural economy, however, serious tensions have arisen between TVEs and agricultural production per se. The Chinese government now confronts a central policy dilemma in which further development of the collectively owned TVE sector in particular is counterpoised against the maintenance of stable agricultural output, especially that of food grains. This paper examines the causes of the dilemma, focusing on the impact of the off-farm sector on agricultural production, and the structural imbalances that now need to be addressed. The paper argues that under current conditions, in which farming communities are pulled in two directions - traditional crop production or rural industries - the absence of functional and spatial segregation is creating serious economic and <b>ecological</b> <b>imbalances</b> in China's countryside.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{ecological}} consequences of hunting by comparing mammalian densities, biomass, relative energy consumption and community structure between sites with {{different levels of}} hunting pressure. Hunting is carried out mainly by colonists who farm {{on the edge of}} Atlantic forest fragments in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Mammals were studied over a period of 18 months, along 2287 km of line transects. Transects were distributed among two protected sites, one slightly hunted site and two heavily hunted sites. Tapirs, the two peccary species, brocket deer, armadillos and agoutis are preferred by hunters in the region. Primates are not hunted in the region. Hunting has affected community structure, with ungulates dominating mammalian biomass at protected sites and primates dominating at hunted sites. This has caused an ecological inversion in the hunted areas of the Atlantic forests. In amazonian regions of the Neotropics hunting is more evenly distributed among primates, large rodents, and ungulates and has resulted in an opposite inversion, with hunted sites having lower primate biomass. Atlantic forests are very susceptible to the possible <b>ecological</b> <b>imbalances</b> induced by hunting by humans, and this must be considered for management and conservation programmes...|$|R
