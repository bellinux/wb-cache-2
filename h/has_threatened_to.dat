5|$|Kurt is menaced {{by school}} bully Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) and badly shaken; while Sue sympathizes with Kurt's plight, she can only punish Karofsky if he {{physically}} attacks Kurt. Glee club co-captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) convinces the glee club girls {{to have their}} football-playing boyfriends defend Kurt, but her own boyfriend, Finn, refuses, concerned that it may jeopardize his position as quarterback. Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale), Noah Puckerman (Mark Salling) and Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) do confront Karofsky, and demand that he leave Kurt alone. Karofsky retaliates, and Sam defends them by fighting with him. Quinn is impressed by Sam's actions, and decides to accept his promise ring. Karofsky later sees Kurt and Finn practicing a wedding dance and taunts {{them in front of}} Burt. Burt is angered by this, but becomes livid when Kurt admits that Karofsky <b>has</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> kill him. He instigates a meeting with Sue, Karofsky's father (Daniel Roebuck) and the two boys, at which Sue expels Karofsky.|$|E
25|$|After {{mediators}} {{failed to}} convince the Islamists to surrender, the Lebanese army attacked Nahr el-Bared once again.

25|$|Some Muslim Americans {{have been}} criticized because of {{perceived}} conflicts between their religious beliefs and mainstream American value systems. Muslim cab drivers in Minneapolis, Minnesota {{have been criticized}} for refusing passengers for carrying alcoholic beverages or dogs. The Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport authority <b>has</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> revoke the operating authority of any driver caught discriminating in this manner. There are reported incidents in which Muslim cashiers have refused to sell pork products to their clientele.|$|E
25|$|John, Patsy and Burke {{have denied}} {{involvement}} {{in the death of}} JonBenét. No charges have been filed in the case, as of September 2016. Several days prior to the airing of this mini-series, Burke Ramsey was interviewed on the Dr. Phil show in a three-episode series about the death of his sister. It was his first public interview. The Ramsey family lawyer, L. Lin Wood, <b>has</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> sue CBS for libel (defamation) based on its conclusion that JonBenét was killed by Burke.|$|E
25|$|In January 1999 Airbus {{established}} a separate company, Airbus Military SAS, to undertake development {{and production of}} a turboprop-powered tactical transport aircraft, the Airbus Military A400M. The A400M is being developed by several NATO members, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey, and the UK, {{as an alternative to}} relying on foreign aircraft for tactical airlift capacity, such as the Ukrainian Antonov An-124 Ruslan and the American C-130 Hercules. The A400M project has suffered several delays; Airbus <b>has</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> cancel the development unless it receives state subsidies.|$|E

25|$|In October 2011 it was {{announced}} that four Arleigh Burke-class destroyers would be forward-deployed in Europe to support the NATO missile defence system. The ships, to be based at Naval Station Rota, Spain, were named in February 2012, as Ross, Donald Cook, Porter, and Carney. By reducing travel times to station, this forward deployment will allow for six other destroyers to be shifted from the Atlantic in support of the Pivot to East Asia. Russia <b>has</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> quit the New START treaty over this deployment, calling it a threat to their nuclear deterrent.|$|E
25|$|Fraternal {{polyandry}} {{in traditional}} Toda society was fairly common; however, this practice {{has now been}} totally abandoned, as has female infanticide. During {{the last quarter of}} the 20th century, some Toda pasture land was lost due to outsiders using it for agriculture or afforestation by the State Government of Tamil Nadu. This <b>has</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> undermine Toda culture by greatly diminishing the buffalo herds. Since the early 21st century, Toda society and culture have been the focus of an international effort at culturally sensitive environmental restoration. The Toda lands are now a part of The Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO-designated International Biosphere Reserve; their territory is declared UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E
25|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that on more than one occasion, the federal {{government}} <b>has</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> withhold highway funds from states which did not pass certain articles of legislation. Any state which lost highway funding for any extended period would face financial impoverishment, infrastructure collapse or both. Although the first such action (the enactment of a national speed limit) was directly related to highways and done {{in the face of a}} fuel shortage, most subsequent actions have had little or nothing to do with highways and have not been done in the face of any compelling national crisis. An example of this would be the federally mandated drinking age of 21, upheld in South Dakota v. Dole. Critics of such actions feel that when the federal government does this they upset the traditional balance between the states and the federal government.|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} of Donald Trump as the 45th. President of the United States of America caught European polity completely off-guard {{with the majority}} of the political, financial & bureaucratic elite having openly come out in support of Hillary Clinton and making disparaging statements about Donald Trump during the US Presidential Campaign period. Brussels has listed the US as posing an existential threat to the EU. Immigration, trade and geopolitical policies unveiled by the Trump administration have provoked reactions ranging from anger to dismay amongst longstanding US allies. Donald Trump has stated that the United Nations and NATO are obsolete in their current form and <b>has</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> withhold US Government funding and review obligations unless both institutions are revamped to alleviate the financial burden on US-taxpayers and modernize themselves to represent the geopolitical realities of the 21st.century. Statements from Presidential advisors and senior administration officials indicate that President Trump is indifferent {{to the future of the}} European Union and the Euro currency.|$|E
25|$|Joey Branning (David Witts) catches Carl dealing {{drugs in}} the nightclub, R and informs Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and Kirsty's husband Max Branning (Jake Wood), who confront and {{threaten}} Carl. Max calls the police because he thinks Carl is involved in Kirsty nearly getting mugged by Carl's brother Adam White (Ben Wigzell) and Carl is checked for drugs by the police in front of Kirsty. Carl has none, and later tells Max that in three weeks' time, he will end Max and Kirsty's relationship. Three weeks later, Carl deliberately cuts the brakes on his car, then takes Phil as his passenger, and crashes it after releasing Phil's seatbelt. Phil is hospitalised and Carl frames Max for cutting the brakes after forcing Ian to become a false witness, promising to cancel the debt. Max is arrested and released on bail, until Carl goads him into attacking him, and he is remanded in custody. Max ends his relationship with Kirsty under Carl's instructions, who <b>has</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>to</b> harm his daughter Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa).|$|E

500|$|In {{its early}} form, {{the concept was}} adopted by a {{decentralized}} online community acting anonymously in a coordinated manner, usually toward a loosely self-agreed goal, and primarily focused on entertainment, or [...] {{often referred to as}} [...] "lulz". Beginning with 2008's Project Chanology—a series of protests, pranks, and hacks targeting the Church of Scientology—the Anonymous collective became increasingly associated with collaborative hacktivism {{on a number of issues}} internationally. Individuals claiming to align themselves with Anonymous undertook protests and other actions (including direct action) in retaliation against copyright-focused campaigns by motion picture and recording industry trade associations. Later targets of Anonymous hacktivism included government agencies of the U.S., Israel, Tunisia, Uganda, and others; the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; child pornography sites; copyright protection agencies; the Westboro Baptist Church; and corporations such as PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, and Sony. Anons have publicly supported WikiLeaks and the Occupy movement. Related groups LulzSec and Operation AntiSec carried out cyberattacks on U.S. government agencies, media, video game companies, military contractors, military personnel, and police officers, resulting in the attention of law enforcement to the groups' activities. [...] Some actions by members of the group have been described as being anti-Zionist.
