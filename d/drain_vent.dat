40|$|For {{purposes}} of the study, the propulsion system was considered as consisting of the following: (1) main engine system, (2) auxiliary propulsion system, (3) pneumatic system, (4) hydrogen feed, fill, <b>drain</b> and <b>vent</b> system, (5) oxygen feed, fill, <b>drain</b> and <b>vent</b> system, and (6) helium reentry purge system. Each component was critically examined to identify possible failure modes and the subsequent effect on mission success. Each space tug mission consists of three phases: launch to separation from shuttle, separation to redocking, and redocking to landing. The analysis considered the results of failure of a component during each phase of the mission. After the failure modes of each component were tabulated, those components whose failure would result in possible or certain loss of mission or inability to return the Tug to ground were identified as critical components and a criticality number determined for each. The criticality number of a component denotes the number of mission failures in one million missions due {{to the loss of}} that component.

Due to its toxicity, most cities moved away from lead water-supply piping by the 1920s in the United States, although lead pipes were approved by national plumbing codes into the 1980s, and lead was used in plumbing solder for drinking water until it was banned in 1986. <b>Drain</b> and <b>vent</b> lines are made of plastic, steel, cast-iron, or lead.|$|R

50|$|Alternately if moving sink to {{an island}} sink, install the P-trap below {{the floor of the}} island and vent {{off the top of the}} drain. Attach toward the trap and reverse 180 degrees so any water in the vent flows down the drain. Slope <b>drain</b> down, slope <b>vent</b> up, and attach to {{existing}} vent from previous existing fixture that is now abandoned. Patch previously existing <b>drain</b> to become <b>vent.</b> In Canada, the national plumbing code requires that the minimum trap arm be at least 2 times the pipe diameter, (e.g. 1.25 inch pipe needs a 2.5-inch trap arm, 1.5 pipe needs a 3-inch trap arm etc.) and that the vent pipe be one size larger than the drain that it serves, also a cleanout is required on both the <b>vent</b> and the <b>drain.</b> The reason for this is in the event of a plugged sink, the waste water will back up and go down the vent, possibly plugging the vent (as it is under the countertop), and a clean-out would permit the cleaning of the pipes.|$|R
5000|$|Standards and {{handbooks}} {{are mainly}} concerned with [...] plates.

The orifices are normally concentric with the pipe (the [...] orifice is a specific exception) and circular (except in the specific case of the [...] or [...] orifice, in which the plate obstructs just {{a segment of the}} pipe). Standards and handbooks stipulate that the upstream surface of the plate is particularly flat and smooth. Sometimes a small <b>drain</b> or <b>vent</b> hole is drilled through the plate where it meets the pipe, to allow condensate or gas bubbles to pass along the pipe.|$|R

40|$|The {{decision}} to make the Centaur Vehicle a Space Transportation System (STS) payload meant that new ground support equipment provisions at Launch Pads Pads 39 A and 39 B were required. These new equipment provisions were needed to service the Centaur vehicle while it was installed in the Orbiter's payload bay prior to launch. This paper describes {{the design of a}} new rolling beam umbilical syste (RBUS) being added to the pad fixed service structure (FSS) in order to provide the primary functions of liquid hydrogen (LH 2) fill, <b>drain,</b> and <b>vent.</b> The carrier plate itself is a Government-furnished equipment item and of necessity became a T-O disconnect. This permits quick offloading {{in the event of an}} abort prior to lift-off. In addition to the rolling beam structure, mechanisms, and fluid lines, it was necessary to design and build a carrier plate simulator to support early development testing of the mast at the Launch Equipment Test Facility at Kennedy Space Center. The RBUS is designed to be compatible with the rotating service structure (RSS) to the extent that the umbilical may be deployed with the RSS mated with the vehicle. It is also designed to clear the RSS as the RSS rotates back out of the way. Accessibility to the Orbiter aft compartment via the 50 - 1 door had to be maintained...|$|R

50|$|When the Ion is fired, the air {{in front}} of the bolt that holds it back is drained back through the solenoid, which causes {{the air in}} the rear of the firing chamber to blow the bolt forward. In order to {{expedite}} the draining of air from the front of the bolt, many users add a quick exhaust valve (QEV) to their marker. The QEV replaces a fitting on the Ion's body and allows the <b>draining</b> air to <b>vent</b> into the body cavity instead of passing all the way back through the solenoid. By allowing the air to vent faster, this allows the bolt to close faster and with more force, which permits lower operating pressure and dwell (the time the solenoid valve is open). The QEV also acts as a trap for excess grease that might otherwise enter the solenoid and cause problems.|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceThomas LoganTypical {{building}} sanitary {{lines are}} sloped {{at a minimum}} of 1 / 8 ” to utilize gravity and prevent liquid separation from solid waste. The purpose {{of this research is}} to analyze how a lesser amount of water from a 1. 6 gallon per flush water closet affects drainage in a four inch diameter pipe at 1 / 4 " slope. Low flow water closet manufacturers ensure that waste clears the bowl, but there is no significant research following the flushed water further down the pipe line. This research utilizes a 1. 6 gallon per flush floor-mounted water closet connected to 30 feet of sloped four inch PVC <b>Drain</b> Waste <b>Vent</b> piping. Data presented from 25 flush trials indicates that further research needs to be conducted at a smaller pipe diameter. Four-inch piping is too large, causing the 1. 6 gallons of water to quickly lose the required force over the course of 30 feet, resulting in pipe line clogs. An average of four additional water-only flushes are necessary to completely clear the test media and toilet paper from the pipe. This research references previously published research and focuses on test results presented by the Plumbing Efficiency Research Coalition.

40|$|Steam {{quality is}} an {{important}} measurement in steam generation. It's a measurement of steam to moisture ratio. In use, steam quality takes on a different meaning- steam which maximizes energy transfer. To do this, the steam must be clean, dry, of desired pressure and free of air and non-condensible gases. Objectives in these areas should be set and an action plan implemented. Typical objectives could be to specify steam pressure delivery of maximum pressure and to use steam at the lowest pressure possible. Steam velocity ranges and maximum system pressure drops should be set. Cleaning steam and protecting control devices {{is an important}} means of maintaining quality. <b>Draining</b> condensate and <b>venting</b> air and other gases preserves the steam quality {{at the point of}} use. Poor pressure control yields poor operation and efficiency. Dirty steam causes valve leaks and maintenance problems.

40|$|Recent {{analyses}} {{suggest that}} thermal constraints will act {{to limit the}} maximum length of an advancing lava flow being fed at a given volume or mass effusion rate from a vent.

In cooling-limited flows, effusion from the vent should be steady; the flow front thickens, eventually stops due to this cooling, and the central channel does not <b>drain.</b> If the <b>vent</b> remains active, a break-out flow will form from some point on the margin of the initial flow unit. If flows on planetary surfaces can be shown to be cooling limited, eruption rates can be estimated.

By this time the boat was in direct communication with Naval Reactors, which ordered the reactor shut down and cooled down and steam generators drained and refilled. The emergency diesel generator, located in engineroom lower level, initially had water in the generator from the incident but it was drained and the diesel was online before the reactor was shut down.

As with other sections of the Manual, consult with Metallurgic expertise to help ensure the appropriate material is selected for the process. 6. 2. 1 General Design Considerations In this section, the design of process equipment for pure phosgene is discussed. Unless otherwise specified, the information provided below generally applies {{to the design of}} storage and non-storage vessels. Phosgene processing equipment has been sited either above or below ground depending on local conditions. Influencing factors can include, but are not limited to: Consequence of a major spill on the locality (e. g., the local population and the weather conditions). <b>Venting,</b> <b>draining,</b> etc. of the immediate area if a major spill occurs. Risk from falling objects and accidental damage from other sources (e. g., traffic). Risks from external vessel corrosion (e. g., environment and ground conditions if sited in a buried storage). Accessibility for vessel inspection (external as well as internal). Approachability to the vessel from all directions to allow access during emergency conditions. Above-ground vessels may, however, be a desirable choice for future installations unless special environmental conditions dictate otherwise. Containment of Spills Development of a containment area around phosgene processing equipment can be used to help prevent an uncontrollable spread should a leak occur.

40|$|Saturn's moon Enceladus has vents {{emerging}} from a sub-surface ocean, offering unique probes into the liquid environment. These <b>vents</b> <b>drain</b> into the larger neutral torus in orbit around Saturn. We present a methanol (CH 3 OH) detection observed with IRAM 30 -m from 2008 along the line-of-sight through Saturn's E-ring. Additionally, we also present supporting observations from the Herschel public archive of water (ortho-H 2 O; 1669. 9 GHz) from 2012 at a similar elongation and line-of-sight. The CH 3 OH 5 (1, 1) - 4 (1, 1) transition was detected at 5. 9 sigma confidence. The line has 0. 43 km/s width and is offset by + 8. 1 km/s in the moon's reference frame. Radiative transfer models allow for gas cloud dimensions from 1750 km up to the telescope beam diameter ~ 73000 km. Taking into account the CH 3 OH lifetime against solar photodissociation and the redshifted line velocity, there are two possible explanations for the CH 3 OH emission: methanol is primarily a secondary product of chemical interactions within the neutral torus that (1) spreads outward throughout the E-ring or (2) originates from a compact, confined gas cloud lagging Enceladus by several km/s. We find either scenario {{to be consistent with}} significant redshifted H 2 O emission (4 sigma) measured from the Herschel public archive. The measured CH 3 OH:H 2 O abundance (> 0. 5 per cent) significantly exceeds the observed abundance in the direct vicinity of the vents (~ 0. 01 per cent), suggesting CH 3 OH is likely chemically processed within the gas cloud with methane (CH 4) as its parent species.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. Hawaiian fountains, {{typically}} occurring on basaltic volcanoes, are sustained, weakly-explosive jets of gas {{and juvenile}} ejecta. A broad range of Hawaiian fountaining styles occurred during twelve episodes of the Mauna Ulu eruption on Kīlauea between May and December 1969. The western episode 1 fissure system is currently well exposed, providing an exclusive opportunity to study processes of low-intensity fissure fountains. Episode 1 fountains occurred along a 5 km long fissure system that exploited the eastern-most kilometer of the Ko'ai fault system. A low, near-continuous, spatter rampart is present on the northern upwind and upslope side of the fissure. Most pyroclastic products, however, fell downwind {{to the south and}} little was preserved because of two processes: 1) incorporation of proximal spatter in rheomorphic lava flows 10 [...] 20 meters from the vents, and 2) downslope transport of cooler spatter falling on top of these flows > 20 meters from vent. There is a clear 'lava-shed' delineation between lava that drained back into the fissure and lava that continued flowing into the flowfield. Vents range in surface geometry from linear [...] circular, with superimposed irregularity and sinuosity, and range from straight-sided [...] flaring cross-sectional geometries. Irregularity results from joints in the pre-existing wall rock. Sinuosity results from the local stress field. Geometry of non-flared vents could indicate the true geometry of the dike. Flared vents likely formed through mechanical erosion and thermo-mechanical abrasion. Vent positions along the fissure likely resulted from flow focusing. Uniquely, these <b>vents</b> <b>drained</b> and remain unobstructed (some > 100 m depth), despite subsequent nearby eruptive activity. Three vents were imaged ≤ 16 m in depth at < 4 cm resolution with tripod-mounted LiDAR. Textural analyses of pyroclasts from eruptive episodes 2 [...] 12 show three distinct degassing and outgassing paths: 1) rapid degassing and quenching with minimal outgassing, 2) prolonged degassing and outgassing, and 3) rapid degassing and quenching on pyroclasts' rims with prolonged internal bubble coalesce. Contrasting patterns of shallow degassing and outgassing were the dominant control driving Hawaiian fountain behavior and variability, and are probably the dominant control for many other Hawaiian-style eruptions...|$|R
