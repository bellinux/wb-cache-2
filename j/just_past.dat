5|$|The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) {{measures}} traffic counts, {{measured in}} terms of annual average daily traffic, with as few as 1,100cars at the northern terminus, and as many as 7,400cars <b>just</b> <b>past</b> the intersection at Pennsylvania Avenue in Roslyn.|$|E
5|$|At {{the traffic}} light {{just north of}} that bend, US44 leaves NY22 and turns right through Millerton's {{historic}} downtown. Maple Avenue on the south marks the former northern terminus of NY361. After that junction, Route44 leaves the village. It passes some strip development on the south, bends slightly {{to the north and}} crosses the Connecticut state line <b>just</b> <b>past</b> a car dealership on the south.|$|E

5|$|Past Eagle Harbor, M-26 {{meets the}} highly scenic Brockway Mountain Drive. The {{northern}} terminus of M-26 {{is located in}} Copper Harbor. The terminus is <b>just</b> <b>past</b> the second intersection with Brockway Mountain Drive near the marina {{and the location of}} the Isle Royale Queen ferry to Isle Royale National Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was assigned the airport's runway 22 for the takeoff, but used runway 26 instead. Runway 26 {{was too short}} for a safe takeoff, causing the aircraft to overrun {{the end of the}} runway before it could become airborne. It crashed <b>just</b> <b>past</b> the end of the runway, killing all 47 passengers and two of the three crew. The flight's first officer was the only survivor.|$|E
5|$|US395 {{returns to}} California as a freeway, but is soon {{downgraded}} to a divided highway <b>just</b> <b>past</b> the state line. The road follows Long Valley Creek {{along the edge}} of the Sierra towards Honey Lake. From this point north, the highway follows a rail line originally built by the Nevada-California-Oregon Railway; the line is now owned by the Union Pacific Railroad.|$|E

5|$|After NY448, NY117 {{becomes a}} four-lane, {{undivided}} at-grade street as it heads northeast through a residential area of Mount Pleasant. <b>Just</b> <b>past</b> the NY448 junction, NY117 enters adjacent interchanges with Saw Mill River Road (NY9A and NY100) and the northbound {{direction of the}} Taconic State Parkway near Graham Hills County Park. From here, the highway passes south of Pace University's Pleasantville campus on {{its way into the}} village of Pleasantville, where it narrows to two lanes and initially serves mostly commercial neighborhoods. NY117 remains on Bedford Road for its first few blocks in Pleasantville; however, it veers northeast onto Manville Road just southwest of the community's central business district.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{struggled}} {{to put a}} flowing move together in the opening exchanges, but it was United who had the better chances, both falling to Ronaldo. The first came in the seventhminute: having been played the ball by Michael Carrick, Ronaldo turned away from Piqué {{on the edge of}} the centre circle, before hitting a shot just wide from almost 40yards; the second saw the ball break to Ronaldo after Anderson and Patrice Evra had linked up well down the left flank. The Portuguese winger controlled the ball on the chest before hitting the ball <b>just</b> <b>past</b> the far post.|$|E
5|$|In Massena, {{the forests}} along NY420 subside {{slightly}} {{as it passes}} by industrial warehouses and residences. The route curves back to the northwest as it enters the village of Massena. <b>Just</b> <b>past</b> the village line, NY420 crosses the St. Lawrence Subdivision, a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation. The highway continues on, curving northward to cross the Raquette River. It curves back to the northwest on the northern riverbank and passes by a mixture of homes and commercial establishments before intersecting NY37 south of the village center. NY420 ends here; however, the road continues north {{into the heart of}} the village as Main Street.|$|E

5|$|<b>Just</b> <b>past</b> {{the county}} line in Oneida Castle, NY5 intersects NY365, a route leading northward to the New York State Thruway in Verona. NY5 presses on, {{passing through the}} city of Sherrill and the village of Vernon (briefly {{overlapping}} NY31) {{and the town of}} Westmoreland to the town of Kirkland, where NY5 intersects NY233, crosses over Oriskany Creek, and meets the western terminus of NY5B. The spur of NY5 later rejoins its parent yards from where NY5A departs NY5 to serve western Utica. NY5 itself continues eastward through New Hartford, meeting NY12B prior to merging with NY12 at Genesee Street. Both routes continue eastward across the Sauquoit Creek into Utica.|$|E
5|$|NY268 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY97 in eastern Hancock. The route heads northeast, paralleling the Quickway (NY17) {{and following the}} east branch of the Delaware River's northern bank through the town of Hancock toward the hamlet of Cadosia. South of the hamlet, NY268 connects to NY17 at exit87A; however, there is no access between NY268 and westbound NY17. <b>Just</b> <b>past</b> the exit, NY268 leaves the pre-Quickway routing of NY17 and follows Cadosia Creek north through a large valley into Cadosia.|$|E
5|$|North of Grand Gorge, NY30 crosses into Schoharie County and intersects NY990V, {{one of four}} {{reference}} {{routes in}} New York erroneously signed as a touring route, near the northeastern edge of the Schoharie Reservoir in Gilboa. From NY990V northward, NY30 follows the Schoharie Creek through Schoharie County to Middleburgh, where it intersects NY145. To the north in Schoharie, NY30 meets NY443 before splitting into NY30 and NY30A north of the village, with Schoharie Creek largely following NY30A. While NY30A connects to Interstate88 (I-88) by way of an interchange a short distance to the north, NY30 has no connection to the freeway. <b>Just</b> <b>past</b> I-88, NY30 intersects NY7. Shortly after passing NY7, NY30 enters Schenectady County.|$|E

5|$|The {{lopsided}} victory allowed Texas to play several less-experienced players. Back-up quarterback Matt Nordgren {{entered the}} game in the thirdquarter, replacing Vince Young. Third-string quarterback Matt McCoy replaced Nordgren <b>just</b> <b>past</b> the midpoint of the fourthquarter. Since Colt McCoy was listed third on the UT depth chart, television broadcasters referred to Matt McCoy (no relation) as Colt McCoy, a mistake they repeated over the season. The Longhorns did not play Colt in the 2005season, choosing to redshirt him instead. After viewing this game as part of a recruiting visit to UT, Jevan Snead – ranked {{as one of the top}} high school quarterbacks in the nation, elected to switch his commitment from University of Florida to Texas.|$|E
5|$|The name Great Northern Highway was gazetted on 10 March 1944, under section10 of the Land Act, 1933–1939. However, {{the highway}} was mostly {{a series of}} tracks through remote {{pastoral}} areas, with the sealed road ending <b>just</b> <b>past</b> the Wheatbelt town of Miling in 1950. Driving was difficult and hazardous all year round. The road was very dusty in the dry season, and some sections of the road were effectively impassable sand, while other sections contained limestone outcrops that damaged tyres. During the wet season, when rivers flooded, sections of road were essentially bogs, or worse still, were completely washed away.|$|E
5|$|The river then {{runs along}} the west of V. Everit Macy Park. As part of the park facilities, the Saw Mill River is impounded into Woodlands Lake, the largest {{impoundment}} on the Saw Mill River, used as a water supply by the local communities of Ardsley and Dobbs Ferry, whose northern village line is just to the south. The river runs close to {{the boundary between the}} two, as the Thruway gradually veers away to the southeast <b>just</b> <b>past</b> the Ashford Avenue bridge.|$|E

5|$|The valley narrows into {{a canyon}} {{as the road}} begins to climb again, closely hugging the north wall. Four miles (6.4km) east of the city, <b>just</b> <b>past</b> Targert Lake Road, it passes the gates where the road is closed in wintertime. Past this point {{development}} along the road abates {{as most of the}} land alongside the road is part of White River National Forest. On {{the north side of the}} road are some of Aspen's more popular climbing cliffs; on the south side are many small parking areas for trailheads, campgrounds and popular swimming holes along the Roaring Fork like Devil's Punchbowl.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Victorville area the scenery changes, as {{suburban}} neighborhoods disappear and the highway traverses the Mojave Desert. While crossing the desert, the route clips the northeastern corner of Edwards Air Force Base. <b>Just</b> <b>past</b> the base the road intersects SR 58 at Kramer Junction. This is currently an at-grade intersection; however, SR58 is gradually being upgraded to a freeway. After leaving Kramer Junction 395 passes the Kramer Junction Solar Electric Generating Station. US395 crosses the Rand and El Paso Mountains, where the highway crosses into San Bernardino–Kern county line, near Johannesburg. While traversing these mountains the route crosses a former Southern Pacific rail line, {{now owned by}} the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) that loosely follows the route of State Route 14 through the Mojave. Though the railroad is abandoned north of Searles Station, US 395 parallels the old railroad grade from this point to Lone Pine.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's goalscoring chance came in {{the fifth}} minute when Poyet found Di Matteo, who fumbled his {{opportunity}} as it went over the goal. Stuttgart almost took the lead through Bobic, who took advantage of Steve Clarke's poor clearance but Bobic's attempt went <b>just</b> <b>past</b> the right goalpost. The Germans continued to push forward, as Balakov had a chance on goal, after being found by Poschner, but his shot was kept out by Ed de Goey to mark the first save of the match. Chelsea held on however; a few minutes later, Poyet ran towards the ball to direct a powerful volley on goal following a weak clearing header from Berthold, but a well-placed Franz Wohlfahrt dived to read the attempt. Chelsea had another chance before half time, which saw Wise from a Di Matteo free kick launch another volley, with the successive effort going just off the target.|$|E
