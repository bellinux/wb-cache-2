25|$|Microsoft made upgrade SKUs of Windows 7 for {{selected}} editions of Windows XP and Windows Vista. The {{difference between these}} SKUs and full SKUs of Windows 7 is their lower price and proof of license ownership of a qualifying previous version of Windows. Same restrictions on in-place upgrading applies to these SKUs as well. In addition, Windows 7 is available as a <b>Family</b> <b>Pack</b> upgrade edition in certain markets, to upgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium only. It gives licenses to upgrade three machines from Vista or Windows XP to the Windows 7 Home Premium edition. These are not full versions, so each machine to be upgraded must {{have one of these}} qualifying previous versions of Windows for them to work. In the United States, this offer expired in early December 2009. In October 2010, to commemorate the anniversary of Windows 7, Microsoft once again made Windows 7 Home Premium <b>Family</b> <b>Pack</b> available for a limited time, while supplies lasted.|$|E
25|$|According to Microsoft, the {{features}} for all editions of Windows 7 are stored on the machine, {{regardless of which}} edition is in use.
