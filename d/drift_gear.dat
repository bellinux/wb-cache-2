5000|$|On release, Famicom Tsūshin {{scored the}} game a 19 out of 40. GamePros Sir Garnabus commented that, [...] "Hairpin turns, bombs in the road, and {{competitors}} who {{never give up}} make Sonic <b>Drift</b> 2 Game <b>Gear</b> racing at its best." [...] He also praised the detailed graphics, controls, {{and the use of}} a different musical piece for each track.|$|R
5000|$|Despite controls, {{violations}} of drift net fishing laws are commonplace. The Mediterranean Sea {{is the most}} overexploited. With 21 modern states with coastline on the sea, there are many fisheries harvesting one small area. When <b>drift</b> net <b>gear</b> was banned, manufacturers modified {{the design of the}} nets so they no longer fell under the banned definition. A new definition was established in 2007 as [...] "any gillnet held on the sea surface or at a certain distance below it by floating devices, drifting with the current, either independently or with the boat to which it may be attached. It may be equipped with devices aiming to stabilize the net or to limit drift".|$|R
40|$|Among the {{different}} <b>gears,</b> <b>drift</b> and set gill nets and bag nets of varied mesh sizes {{are widely used}} along {{the east and west}} coasts while ring seines, purse seines and mechanised gill nets are confined to the southwest coast. Trawlers upto 11 m OAL are operated along the entire coast, while the second-generation large trawlers (13 - 17 m) are employed from selected harbours along both the coasts. The share of mechanised sector to the total landings increased from 20...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{describe}} in The Russian North Pole Drifting Stations {{for the first}} time the history of establishing drifting stations in the Arctic Basin since 1937. They set out the main aims and goals of the observations made and outline the methods of organizing the <b>drifting</b> stations, <b>gear</b> and equipment for life support and scientific observations at the North Pole drifting stations and during the airborne high-latitudinal expeditions. The main scientific results and the analysis of data obtained during metereological, oceanographic, ice and geophysical observations are presented and the book contains illustrations, maps and tables that can be used by a wide range of specialists investigating the nature of the Arctic region. An analysis of the contribution of the data collected at the drifting stations, the process of envionmental research in the Arctic Basin and the plans for future use of drifting stations is provided, with special emphasis on the forthcoming International Polar Year 2007 - 2008...|$|R
50|$|There were {{originally}} eight cams for forward motion and three for reverse, which gave {{a range of}} cut-offs from 15% to 85% in forward gear. The hand reversing screw spindle carried a disk, suitably notched with a locking device {{to ensure that the}} cam rollers would be in the centre of the selected cams under working conditions. During <b>drifting,</b> the reversing <b>gear</b> is placed in the neutral position where the exhaust valves are held fully open. These conditions were ideal for drifting and superior to any Walschaerts valve gear in admitting steam to the steam chests, even with cylinders equipped with by-pass valves, snifting valves and drifting valves.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Plastic floats from fishing nets are {{commonly}} found {{washed up on}} beaches in southern Brazil. They are usually broken and show signs of having been repaired. Characteristics of floats and interviews with fishermen suggest two main causes of float loss. First, collisions between active gear, bottom trawl nets for shrimp, and passive <b>gear,</b> <b>drift</b> nets for fish, destroy nets and release fragments of them, including floats. Second, the difficulty with which floats are inserted on the float rope of the nets when they are used near the surface. Floats are inserted to replace damaged or lost floats, {{or they may be}} removed if it is desired that the nets be used in deeper waters. Floats may thus be poorly fixed to the cables and lost. Here a new float design that offers greater safety in use and for the replacement of floats is described and tested...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Kerguelen Plateau {{constitutes}} a natural obstacle for the eastward {{progress of the}} Antarctic Circumpolar Current, especially around the Kerguelen Islands. However, there is little quantitative knowledge of the current field around the islands {{due to lack of}} long-term current measurements. We performed a systematic analysis of a total of 28917 points of fishing <b>gear</b> <b>drifts</b> from setting and recovery positions of demersal longlines deployed between 2002 and 2007 for Patagonian Toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) fisheries in Kerguelen waters. This enabled the construction of a realistic field of depth-averaged time-mean slope currents along the 1000 m isobath all around the Kerguelen Islands. The strongest depth-mean velocities of 25 cm s− 1 are associated with the Polar Front, which rounds the islands from the south and flows northward along the inner continental slope immediately east of the islands, strongly supporting previous hydrographic evidence. These results demonstrate the potential for hitherto unexploited historic longline drift data from demersal fishing grounds to provide valuable quantitative information on the regional circulatio...|$|R
50|$|Off {{the coast}} of {{southern}} California NMFS, NOAA, and Department of Commerce prohibited fishing with large <b>drift</b> gillnet (DGN) <b>gear</b> in the loggerhead conservation area during the presence of El Niño conditions {{in order to protect}} the endangered North Pacific Ocean loggerhead DPS. This ruling effective July 23, 2014 was intended to prevent bycatch of loggerhead sea turtles. A team including sea turtle biologists and oceanographers determined the presence of El Niño conditions based on the “El Niño watch” issued by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC), anomalies found in sea surface temperature (SST) charts published by NOAA’s Coast Watch Program, the presence of loggerhead sea turtles in the Pacific loggerhead conservation area, and reports of loggerhead strandings. The SST data showed higher than average temperatures during summer months off {{the coast of}} southern California. This same fisheries closure ruling due to El Niño conditions was again implemented May 29, 2015, and then again June 1, 2016.|$|R
500|$|The CD-I {{version was}} coded by Ashley Hogg. He stated {{that there were}} {{problems}} that only occurred on this console, and CD-Rs were expensive. The Game Gear team were originally against the [...] "on-rails" [...] handling of the Mega Drive version, and wanted to revert to the NES <b>drifting.</b> The Game <b>Gear</b> version was created by Ashley Routledge and Dave Saunders, who adjusted the Mega Drive graphics to the Game Gear's smaller screen. It was produced alongside the Mega Drive version, and programmed from scratch to run at 60 frames per second (FPS). The main problem was keeping as much detail as possible on the Game Gear's inferior storage and memory capabilities. Much of the art had to be redrawn with fewer colours at lower resolutions. The biggest problem was the screen size, which {{made it difficult to}} take corners at high speeds. The team tweaked the camera movement so the vehicle was positioned further back, so players were able to see the track ahead according to how fast the vehicle is travelling. Another thing considered important was the lack of options screens, as it was felt players should be able to [...] simply play the game.|$|R
40|$|In July 1990, an {{observer}} program {{was established to}} collect data on the bycatch of the drift and set gillnet fisheries operating off the coast of California. These data are used for estimating mortality and for further studies of the biology of the species impacted. To date. 16 species of Cetacea have been identified in the observed incidental kill of the gillnet fisheries. In the drift gillnet fishery, observers reported 348 cetaceans incidentally killed, and biological samples were collected from 83. 6 % of these animals. The common dolphin, Delphinus delphis, was the most frequently observed species entangled in the <b>drift</b> gillnet fishing <b>gear</b> and comprised 48. 6 % of the observed incidental kill. In the set gillnet fishery, 20 cetaceans were observed killed, and biological samples were collected from five of these animals. The harbour porpoise, Phocoenaphocoena. was the most frequently observed species entangled in set gillnet gear and comprised 80 % of the observed incidental kill. In this report, we summarise, by species, the age, the total body length and the sex composition of cetaceans sampled from the incidental kill in the drift gillnet fishery between July 1990 and December 1995, and in the set gillnet fishery hetween July 1990 and December 1994. We also demonstrate the value of collecting small samples of skin tissue for confirming species identification using molecular genetic techniques...|$|R
40|$|Sharks {{have been}} {{traditionally}} fished in the South Spanish Mediterranean using <b>drift</b> surface longline <b>gears.</b> Soon in the XX century {{the target species}} was changed to the swordfish. In our days, the swordfish longline fishery results in a certain by-catch of some shark species in the Mediterranean. By-catches can affect biodiversity through impact on top predators species which are usually longlived and have low reproductive rates (sharks, sea turtles, mammals). In this paper we report information related to sharks by-catches in the Spanish Mediterranean swordfish longline fishery. The data {{used in this study}} were collected by observers on board of commercial vessels operating with surface long line from 1997 to 1999. In the Western Mediterranean Sea, swordfish fishing area extends from the Straits of Gibraltar to latitude 07 ºE; and from longitude 42 ºN to the limit of the Moroccan and Algerian territorial waters. The shark species caught during the study period were the blue shark, the shortfin mako, common thresher shark, Sphyrna zygaena and Galeorhinus galeus. The main species in the catches was the blue shark followed by the shortfin mako. The blue shark size composition shows a high importance of juveniles. Only a few specimens are mature ones and only one female was pregnant. The shortfin mako size composition shows a total dominance of juvenile specimens. These biological aspects and some other ones will be discussed in this report. Fisheries effects on shark population and shark life history are suggested as causes of commercial pelagic shark stock characteristics in the Spanish Mediterranean waters...|$|R
40|$|On the fish-catching-fluctuation of the {{respective}} hook, based on the variation {{in the construction of}} the yellowfin tuna <b>drifting</b> long-line <b>gear</b> and its deformation in the water some experimental researches were carried out, with the measurement of the tension coming on to the main-line and the clarification of the physical basic conditions of the main-line. The results obtained may be summarized as in the following : 1) The main-line of the tuna long-line in the water shows catenary form or its variation. 2) Feeding-ratio of the fish to {{the respective}} hook is highest at the hook attached to the dropper hanged from the main-line drifting deepest, and is lowest at the hook attached to the dropper hanged from either end of the main-line drifting shallowest. The shorter is the distance between the buoys at the both ends of the main-line, the bigger becomes the differences in the feeding-ratioes of the hooks. On the other hand, by experiments, it was ascertained that in case of the long-line gear in which the depth at which the droppers are hanged is equal, the difference in the feeding-ratio is negligible. Accordingly, the ratio of the feeding frequency of the tuna at the hook of the dropper hanged deepest, to the feeding-difference between the hook of the dropper hanged from the main-line drifting deepest and the hook hanged from another location of the main-line (x); and the ratio of the main-line length between the above mentioned two hooks, to the depth-difference between them (y) were sought out, and the relationship of (x) and (y) was expressed in the following experimental formulas (1 ~ 8). 3) Within the range of the identical fishing gear, the effectiveness in the catching faculty of the long line at the respective hook is in the right proportion to the increase of the depth of the hook; while between the gears with different constructions there is no constant relationship between the depth of the fishing hook and the effectiveness in the catching faculty. Hence it was assumed that the difference in the catching effectiveness between the hooks within one gear is not related with the difference in the vertical density of the fish school, but rather is due to the fluctuations in the arrangement of the hooks, based on the changing deformation of the catenary form of the main-line. 4) The relationship of the enrolling velocity (V) and the main-line tension (T) was measured experimentally, and an experimental formulars were made up. 5) Concerning the three fishing vessels of the three different sizes; large, middle and small, the main-line tensions under the fishing hours were measured : and the additional tensions of the main-line which is to be brought forth by the hook-dragging fed by tuna and others were also measured and examined. ...|$|R
