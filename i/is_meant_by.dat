5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific law. This view {{has been subjected to}} substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize what <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>by</b> an explanation when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any law because {{it is a matter of}} chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained. Others have argued that the key to a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E

25|$|The isometries of {{the plane}} act {{on the set of}} 2D images and patterns, such as {{wallpaper}} patterns. The definition can be made more precise by specifying what <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>by</b> image or pattern; e.g., a function of position with values in a set of colors. Isometries are in fact one example of affine group (action).|$|E
25|$|The {{attribute}} of extension is how substance {{can be understood}} to be physically extended in space. Particular things which have breadth and depth (that is, occupy space) are what <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>by</b> extended.

25|$|The {{meaning of}} the term {{geometry}} in the context of Minkowski space depends heavily on what <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>by</b> the term. Minkowski space is not endowed with a Euclidean geometry, and not with any of the generalized Riemannian geometries with intrinsic curvature, those exposed by the model spaces in hyperbolic geometry (negative curvature) and the geometry modeled by the sphere (positive curvature). The reason is the indefiniteness of the Minkowski metric. Minkowski space is, in particular, not a metric space and not a Riemannian manifold with a Riemannian metric. However, Minkowski space contains submanifolds endowed with a Riemannian metric yielding hyperbolic geometry.|$|E
25|$|Later the {{equations}} of motion also appeared in electrodynamics, when describing the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields, the Lorentz force is the general equation which serves as the definition of what <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>by</b> an electric field and magnetic field. With the advent of special relativity and general relativity, the theoretical modifications to spacetime meant the classical {{equations of motion}} were also modified {{to account for the}} finite speed of light, and curvature of spacetime. In all these cases the differential equations were in terms of a function describing the particle's trajectory in terms of space and time coordinates, as influenced by forces or energy transformations.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, the Newtonian {{concepts}} of absolute {{time and space}} were challenged by relativity. Einstein's principle of equivalence put all observers, moving or accelerating, on the same footing. This led to an ambiguity as to what exactly <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>by</b> {{the force of gravity}} and weight. A scale in an accelerating elevator cannot be distinguished from a scale in a gravitational field. Gravitational force and weight thereby became essentially frame-dependent quantities. This prompted the abandonment of the concept as superfluous in the fundamental sciences such as physics and chemistry. Nonetheless, the concept remained important in the teaching of physics. The ambiguities introduced by relativity led, starting in the 1960s, to considerable debate in the teaching community as how to define weight for their students, choosing between a nominal definition of weight as the force due to gravity or an operational definition defined by the act of weighing.|$|E

25|$|There is {{disagreement}} in surgical textbooks regarding {{which side}} of the recipient’s pelvis to use in receiving the transplant. Campbell's Urology (2002) recommends placing the donor kidney in the recipient’s contralateral side (i.e. a left sided kidney would be transplanted in the recipient's right side) to ensure the renal pelvis and ureter are anterior in the event that future surgeries are required. In an instance where there is doubt over whether there is enough space in the recipient’s pelvis for the donor's kidney, the textbook recommends using the right side because the right side has a wider choice of arteries and veins for reconstruction. Smith's Urology (2004) states that either side of the recipient's pelvis is acceptable; however the right vessels are 'more horizontal' with respect to each other and therefore easier to use in the anastomoses. It is unclear what <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>by</b> the words 'more horizontal'. Glen's Urological Surgery (2004) recommends putting the kidney in the contralateral side in all circumstances. No reason is explicitly put forth; however, one can assume the rationale {{is similar to that of}} Campbell, i.e. to ensure that the renal pelvis and ureter are most anterior in the event that future surgical correction becomes necessary.|$|E
25|$|Before the 19th century, {{divergent}} series were widely used by Leonhard Euler and others, but often led to confusing and contradictory results. A major problem was Euler's idea that any {{divergent series}} {{should have a}} natural sum, without first defining what <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>by</b> the sum of a divergent series. Augustin-Louis Cauchy eventually gave a rigorous definition of the sum of a (convergent) series, and for some time after this, divergent series were mostly excluded from mathematics. They reappeared in 1886 with Henri Poincaré's work on asymptotic series. In 1890, Ernesto Cesàro realized that one could give a rigorous definition of the sum of some divergent series, and defined Cesàro summation. (This {{was not the first}} use of Cesàro summation, which was used implicitly by Ferdinand Georg Frobenius in 1880; Cesàro's key contribution was not the discovery of this method, but his idea that one should give an explicit definition of the sum of a divergent series.) In the years after Cesàro's paper, several other mathematicians gave other definitions of the sum of a divergent series, although these are not always compatible: different definitions can give different answers for the sum of the same divergent series; so, when talking about the sum of a divergent series, it is necessary to specify which summation method one is using.|$|E

The Big Book (from Alcoholics Anonymous) states that once a person is an alcoholic, they are always an alcoholic, but does not define what <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>by</b> the term alcoholic in this context.
