He splashed the detergent in his eyes. Slit-lamp examination revealed extensive epithelial damage to the left eye, leading to a persistent corneal epithelial defect. We used a bandage soft contact lens with levofloxacin eye drops as concomitant therapy {{in order to promote}} healing. However, a strain of fluoroquinolone-resistant Corynebacterium colonized the eye, so that the corneal ulcer eventually became severe. Use of the bandage soft contact lens was discontinued. His antimicrobial agent was changed to cefmenoxime, a drug to which fluoroquinolone-resistant Corynebacterium is sensitive, and topical instillation of autologous serum subsequently promoted improvement of the ulcer. On day 38 after injury, iris rubeosis led to hyphema and ghost cell glaucoma. With improvement of his corneal epithelial defect, the iris rubeosis and hyphema regressed and his visual acuity improved to 20 / 25 on the left eye. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a case resulting in severe complications due to chemical injury by a neutral detergent. Ophthalmologists should be aware that corneal epithelial damage may become prolonged in elderly patients with diabetes, and unexpectedly severe when wearing bandage soft contact lens, with infection of Corynebacterium resistant to fluoroquinolones, even if the chemical agent is a neutral detergent.

40|$|There are {{presently}} over 182 RBC plants, treating domestic wastewater, in the Republic of Ireland, 136 {{of which have}} been installed since 1986. The use of this treatment plant technology, although not new, is becoming increasingly popular. The aim of this research was to assess the effects that a <b>household</b> <b>detergent</b> has on rotating biological contractor treatment plant efficiency. Household detergents contribute phosphorus to the surrounding environment and can also remove beneficial biomass from the disc media. A simple modification was made to a conventional flat disc unit to increase the oxygen transfer of the process. The treatment efficiency of the modified RBC (with aeration cups attached) was assessed against a parallel conventional system, with and without degergent loading. The parameters monitored were chemical oxygen demand (COD), bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrates, phosphates, dissolved oxygen, the motors power consumption, pH, and temperature. Some microscopic analysis of the biofilm was also to be carried out. The treatment efficiency of both units was compared, based on COD/BOD removal. The degree of nitrification achievable by both units was also assessed with any fluctuations in pH noted. Monitoring of the phosphorus removal capabilities of both units was undertaken. Relationships between detergent concentrations and COD removal efficiencies were also analysed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the efficiency of an anaerobic stirred sequencing-batch reactor containing granular biomass for the degradation of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), a surfactant present in <b>household</b> <b>detergent.</b> The bioreactor was monitored for LAS concentrations in the influent, effluent and sludge, pH, chemical oxygen demand, bicarbonate alkalinity, total solids, and volatile solids. The degradation of LAS {{was found to be}} higher in the absence of co-substrates (53 %) than in their presence (24 - 37 %). Using the polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR/DGGE), we identified populations of microorganisms from the Bacteria and Archaea domains. Among the bacteria, we identified uncultivated populations of Arcanobacterium spp. (94 %) and Opitutus spp. (96 %). Among the Archaea, we identified Methanospirillum spp. (90 %), Methanosaeta spp. (98 %), and Methanobacterium spp. (96 %). The presence of methanogenic microorganisms shows that LAS did not inhibit anaerobic digestion. Sampling at the last stage of reactor operation recovered 61 clones belonging to the domain bacteria. These represented a variety of phyla: 34 % shared significant homology with Bacteroidetes, 18 % with Proteobacteria, 11 % with Verrucomicrobia, 8 % with Fibrobacteres, 2 % with Acidobacteria, 3 % with Chlorobi and Firmicutes, and 1 % with Acidobacteres and Chloroflexi.

The present study was carried out to evaluate the effects of laundry and bathtub greywater irrigation in sands on the growth of couch grass (Cynodondactylon L.) sod in a tank experimental study. Untreated laundry and bathtub greywater collected from a residential home were monitored for sodium (Na), chlorine (Cl) and boron (B), as these elements are dominant in <b>household</b> <b>detergent</b> and cleaning products. The turf grasses were planted in the modified aquarium tank with triplicate for each irrigation type. Irrigation sources included (i) 100 % potable water as a control (TW) (ii) untreated full cycle laundry water (LGW) (iii) untreated bathtub water (BGW) over 24 weeks. The reduction on soil hydraulic conductivity was tested using double rings infiltrometer.

The results showed that the high salt (Na, Cl) and B content was significant in laundry greywater compared to bathtub. Irrigation with laundry and bathtub greywater without fertilizer addition was insufficient to sustain the turf growth. Long-term use of laundry and bathtub greywater can lead to Na, Cl and B accumulation in the soil and subsequent uptake by the turf grass.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify organic compounds that could serve as indicators of potential human fecal contamination sources to the Kranji Reservoir in Singapore that could be used as confirmation indicators along with bacteria indicators. The compounds chosen as potential tracers were nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxyltes (NPEOs), as these are indicative of sewage and have been found at measurable concentrations in rivers and streams elsewhere in Asia. Polyethylene devices (PEDs) were used as passive samplers to measure NPEOs in stormwater drains in Kranji catchment. Fieldwork was conducted in the month of January 2010. PEDs were deployed in different land use areas in order to obtain an overview of concentration ranges across the Kranji catchment and thus provide an indication of where and why this family of compounds could be found. Storm drains vary in design and since experience with PEDs in storm drains was limited, different types of drains were selected for deployment. The PED deployment design changed depending on the type of drain and the available tools and local conditions that were found. Subsequent chemical analysis of the PEDs was done at MIT. PED deployment times in Kranji were not long enough for mass transfer equilibrium between the water and the PED to be reached, and thus a model for kinetic sampling was used to estimate concentrations in the water. The results of fieldwork done for this study showed that survival of the PEDs was highly dependent on type of drains and flow intensity. The results of the laboratory analysis showed that NPEOs were present in non-residential areas of the catchment. The kinetic sampling model produced results that, although highly uncertain, give an indication of potentially risky concentrations in the water. These analysis lead to the recommendation that PEDs should be deployed pre-loaded with tracers to better model equilibrium in stormwater drains. Deployment should be considered at or near sites where human DNA factors and/or E. coli have been found. More information is needed on <b>household</b> <b>detergent</b> ingredients in Singapore to further evaluate using NPEOs as sewage indicators. Future studies should be done to confirm estimated NPEOs concentrations in Kranji water to verify if there is a risk to the ecosystem's health. by Adriana Mendez Sagel. Thesis (M. Eng.)

Methods: The present descriptive cross-sectional study, of all poisoning cases presenting to the children hospital during January 2014 to July 2015 and children from one to twelve years of age were included. The data was collected through referring to all parents of the children and using a questionnaire that included demographic and poisoning characteristic information. The demographic features included gender, age, place of residency and type of poisons was investigated. Also parents were interviewed by using structured questionnaire containing information on socio-demographic factors, parental smoking, parental education level, child's behavior, and storage practices of hazardous substances of caregivers inside homes. Results: Children poisoning was common among low educated family with parental smoker and was higher for boys (59 %) than girls (41 %). However, there was no mortality. Poisoning was unintentional and most of the poisoned cases, 63 (61. 7 %) of the children involved were below the age of four years i. e., between 1 and 3 years of age.
