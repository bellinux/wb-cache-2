25|$|Israel was {{the first}} non-European country to be {{associated}} to the European Union's Framework Programme for Research and Technical Development (RTD). Israel's special status {{is the result of}} its high level of scientific and research capability and the dense network of long-standing relations in scientific and technical co-operation between Israel and the EU. The European Commission signed an agreement with Israel in July 2004 allowing for its participation in the EU's Galileo project for a <b>global</b> <b>navigation</b> satellite system.

25|$|A <b>global</b> <b>navigation</b> {{satellite}} system (GNSS) provides autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. A GNSS allows small electronic receivers {{to determine their}} location such as longitude, latitude, and altitude to within a few meters using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites in outer space. Receivers {{on the ground with}} a fixed position {{can also be used to}} calculate the precise time as a reference for scientific experiments. The first such system was Transit, developed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory under the leadership of Richard Kershner. Development of the system for the United States Navy began in 1958, and a prototype satellite,Transit 1A, was launched in September 1959. That satellite failed to reach orbit. A second satellite, Transit 1B, was successfully launched April 13, 1960 by a Thor-Ablestar rocket. The last Transit satellite launch was in August 1988.|$|E
25|$|IRNSS is an {{independent}} regional navigation satellite system being developed by India. It {{is designed to provide}} accurate position information service to users in India as well as the region extending up to 1500km from its boundary, which is its primary service area. IRNSS will provide two types of services, namely, Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Restricted Service (RS) and is expected to provide a position accuracy of better than 20m in the primary service area. It is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system being developed by Indian Space Research Organisation, which is under total control of Indian government. The requirement of such a navigation system is driven by the fact that access to <b>Global</b> <b>Navigation</b> Satellite Systems like GPS is not guaranteed in hostile situations. ISRO initially planned to launch the constellation of satellites between 2012 and 2014 but the project got delayed by nearly 2 years.|$|E

2500|$|Galileo is the <b>global</b> <b>navigation</b> {{satellite}} system (GNSS) {{that is currently}} being created by the European Union (EU) through the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European GNSS Agency (GSA), headquartered in Prague in the Czech Republic, with two ground operations centres, Oberpfaffenhofen near Munich in Germany and Fucino in Italy. The €5billion project is named after the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. One of the aims of Galileo is to provide an independent high-precision positioning system so European nations {{do not have to}} rely on the Russian GLONASS, [...] Chinese BeiDou or US GPS systems, which could be disabled or degraded by their operators at any time.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{to sharpen}} {{resolution}} {{from the standard}} GPS 100nanoseconds to the 1nanosecond range metrology labs achieve, OPERA researchers used [...] Septentrio’s precise PolaRx2eTR GPS timing receiver, along with consistency checks across clocks (time calibration procedures) which allowed for common-view time transfer. The PolaRx2eTR allowed measurement of the time offset between an atomic clock {{and each of the}} <b>Global</b> <b>Navigation</b> Satellite System satellite clocks. For calibration, the equipment was taken to the Swiss Metrology Institute (METAS). In addition, highly stable cesium clocks were installed both at LNGS and CERN to cross-check GPS timing and to increase its precision. After OPERA found the superluminal result, the time calibration was rechecked both by a CERN engineer and the German Institute of Metrology (PTB). Time-of-flight was eventually measured to an accuracy of 10nanoseconds. The final error bound was derived by combining the variance of the error for the individual parts.|$|E

2500|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based <b>global</b> <b>navigation</b> {{satellite}} system that provides reliable, three-dimensional positioning, navigation, and timing services to worldwide users on a continuous basis in all weather, day and night, anywhere {{on or near}} the Earth. 24 satellites orbit around the Earth twice a day, transmitting signaled information to GPS receivers that take this information and use triangulation to calculate the user's exact location. Ultimately, the GPS is the descendant of the United States Navy's Timation satellite program and the United States Air Force's 621-B satellite program. The invention of GPS was a collaborative and team effort. The basic architecture of GPS was devised {{in less than a month}} in 1972 by Colonel Bradford Parkinson, Mel Birnbaum, Bob Rennard, and Jim Spilker. However, Richard Easton, a son of Roger Easton who was the head of the U.S. Navy's Timation program, claims that his father invented GPS and filed U.S. patent #3,789,409 in 1974. Other names listed by Richard Easton are James Buisson, Thomas McCaskill, Don Lynch, Charles Bartholomew, Randolph Zwirn and, [...] "an important outsider," [...] Robert Kern. Ivan Getting, while working at Raytheon, envisioned a {{satellite system}} similar to MOSAIC, a railroad mobile ballistic missile guidance system, but working more like LORAN. The GPS program was approved in December 1973, the first GPS satellite was launched in 1978, and by August 1993, 24 GPS satellites were in orbit. Initial operational capability was established in December of that same year while in February 1994, the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) declared GPS ready for use.|$|E
