25|$|The Morelands {{have spoken}} to journalists, {{including}} Edward R. Murrow, about family life in a lighthouse that was still, at the time, a half-mile from the nearest land. The Coast Guard supplied them with water, so they no longer needed {{to rely on the}} cistern, although it was still kept full. It was necessary {{to go back to the}} land at least every two days for milk, and they bought groceries every two weeks. The couple could never go out together as one of them had to remain at the lighthouse at all times. During one power outage, Richard Moreland hung an emergency kerosene lamp in the lantern house and rang the <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> himself.|$|E
500|$|The keeper's {{house from}} 1833 had a frame kitchen {{addition}} that {{connected to the}} lighthouse, but it was replaced in 1858 with a Gothic Revival gambrel-roofed wood-frame house. In 1966, the house was torn down and replaced by a duplex house. In 1852, a fourth-order Fresnel lens from Barbler and Fenestre replaced the original ten lamps and [...] reflectors. In 1890, a fifth-order Fresnel lens, which {{is still in the}} tower today, was installed. An appropriation of $800 was made for a <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> in 1850, and it was installed in 1854 at a cost of $1000. Two years later the machinery to automatically strike the <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> was completed. The 1867 renovation saw the addition of a fog siren, but it was removed and replaced with the <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> in 1874 and a new <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> was later installed in 1883. Lynde Point Lighthouse used whale oil until 1879 when it switched to kerosene, it was electrified in 1955 and fully automated by the United States Coast Guard in 1978.|$|E
500|$|James Tomison, {{who became}} a keeper in 1861, wrote of the bird migrations visible from the tower: [...] "Hundreds of birds are flying about in all directions, {{crossing}} and re-crossing one another's flight, but never coming into collision, all seemingly {{of the opinion that}} the only way of escape out of the confusion into which they have got is through the windows of the lantern". A <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> had been installed by then, one of only two operating in Scotland at the time.|$|E

5000|$|Some later <b>fog</b> <b>bells</b> {{were placed}} under water, {{particularly}} in especially dangerous areas, {{so that their}} sound (which would be a predictable code, such as the number [...] "23") would be carried further and reverberate through the ship's hull. For example, this technique was used at White Shoal Light (Michigan). [...] This was an earlier precursor to RACON.|$|R
500|$|Constructed in 1847, the new [...] {{octagonal}} {{tower was}} constructed by Marcus Bassett with East Haven brownstone from Jabez Potter's quarry. The {{interior of the}} lighthouse was lined with New Haven brick and a 74-step granite stairway leads to the cast-iron lantern. The light was powered by 12 lamps with reflectors and was located [...] above sea level. Also constructed was a new two-and-one-half story brick house to replace the one in a [...] "very bad state of repair". The light would be replaced with a fourth-order Fresnel lens in 1855. In the 1860s, a <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> was also added.|$|E
500|$|Completed in 1871, the rebuilt {{light had}} a {{dwelling}} with the attached tower containing a fourth-order Fresnel lens. It retained the original fixed red light, but {{also included a}} <b>fog</b> <b>bell.</b> In 1900, the lighthouse was identified in the Light List as having a red screw-pile structure, a white tower and dwelling with a slate-gray Mansard roof topped with a black lantern. The lighthouse had a fog signal that sounded every 15 seconds and was operated by machinery. Although the focal height of the light is unlisted, {{the center of the}} light stood [...] above the ground.|$|E
500|$|The solid base {{weighing}} 1,840tons rises {{more than}} [...] above the pounding seas, {{more than twice}} as high as its nearest British rival of Skerryvore. The blocks, having been shaped and fitted on Erraid, were towed out to the rock in barges by the steamer ‘Dhuheartach’ each barge carrying 16tons. Masonry work was completed in 1871 and the lantern, optical apparatus and <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> installed the following year, Dubh Artach becoming the first isolated rock light in Britain to use paraffin. The finished tower rises [...] above the foundation in seventy-seven courses of stonework all told.|$|E
50|$|The {{area was}} the scene of a number of shipwrecks. On August 3, 1846, the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company's paddle steamer Prince ran into the cliffs about 2½ km north of Baily in heavy fog, and as a result it was decided that <b>fog</b> <b>bells</b> should be {{installed}} at the lighthouse. This work was delayed due to costs of other construction projects.|$|R

5000|$|San Rafael sank near Alcatraz Island on November 30, 1901, {{following}} a collision {{in the fog}} with the steam ferry Sausalito. [...] Both vessels were owned by the same company, the North Pacific Coast Railroad. San Rafael was bound across San Francisco Bay, from San Francisco to Sausalito. [...] Both vessels were proceeding slowly and ringing <b>fog</b> <b>bells.</b> Both captains realized the other ship was near, and had ordered the engines reversed, {{but it was too}} late to prevent a collision. Sausalito struck San Rafael broadside and penetrated ten feet into the dining room, then occupied by many passengers. Prompt action by the captains of the two vessels, in lashing the ships together, kept San Rafael afloat long enough for most of the passengers and crew to evacuate to Sausalito. A boiler explosion on San Rafael was averted when a fireman went into the fireroom, then neck-deep in water, and opened a valve to bleed off the steam in the boilers. Twenty minutes after the collision, San Rafael sank in around 120 feet of water. This sinking is said to have inspired Jack London in writing the opening scenes of his novel The Sea Wolf. [...] The captain of San Rafael, John Tayler Mackenzie, was the last person to leave the sinking vessel.|$|R
500|$|Five Mile Point Light, {{also known}} as Five Mile Point Lighthouse or Old New Haven Harbor Lighthouse, is a U.S. {{lighthouse}} in Long Island Sound {{on the coast of}} New Haven, Connecticut. [...] Located at the entrance to New Haven Harbor, the beacon's name derives from its proximity to Downtown New Haven, about five miles (8km) away. [...] The original lighthouse consisted of a [...] octagonal wooden tower built in 1805 by Abisha Woodward. In 1847, a new [...] octagonal tower was constructed by Marcus Bassett with East Haven brownstone. [...] This new beacon was illuminated by 12 lamps with reflectors which were positioned [...] above sea level. Also constructed at this time was a two-and-one-half story brick house which supplanted the previous, deteriorating keeper's dwelling. [...] A fourth-order Fresnel lens replaced the lamps in 1855 and a <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> was added in the 1860s. The Five Mile Point Light was deactivated in 1877 when the nearby Southwest Ledge Light was completed. [...] Currently, the lighthouse is contained within Lighthouse Point Park and, along with the keeper's house, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.|$|E
2500|$|Elwood was {{powered by}} twin horizontally-mounted steam engines, {{each with a}} [...] bore and a 72-inch stroke. [...] The engines were {{manufactured}} by Iowa by the Dubuque Iron Works, and were of the Poppet-valve type. [...] The boiler had 186 [...] tubes, each [...] long. [...] The boiler was licensed to produce steam at 165 pounds pressure. [...] Engine room signals were given from the pilot house by speaking tube, and manual and electric bells. [...] There was a <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> on the upper deck.|$|E
2500|$|A {{coal-fired}} furnace fed the steam-heating system. Water for bathing {{and drinking}} was initially collected from rains {{on the roof}} and stored in the basement cistern. Coal for refueling the furnace was dropped off by boat. All food had to be obtained by the keeper from land, either by boating to Tarrytown or walking across the ice (a potentially dangerous trip) in winter. The lantern and <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> were powered by a battery; there was no other electricity in the lighthouse for its first 60 years. [...] All lighting came from kerosene lamps.|$|E

50|$|Lightship 58 {{was built}} in 1894 by Craig Shipbuilding of Toledo, Ohio for $50,870.00. Lightship 58 was built of an iron-plated steel frame and {{equipped}} with two lanterns, a 12-inch steam chime whistle, and a hand operated <b>bell</b> <b>fog</b> signal. Each of the lanterns contained eight oil lamps with reflectors. Lightship 58 was transferred to Fire Island, New York in 1896.|$|R
50|$|The light {{alone was}} found to be {{inadequate}} in <b>fog,</b> and a <b>bell</b> was installed in the 1860s. The machinery was housed in a small building on the cliff face and operated by a weight which fell in a tube running down the sheer cliff. A siren replaced the bell after only fifteen years. When required the foghorn sounds once every 60 seconds.|$|R
2500|$|Inside, the {{entrance}} {{leads to the}} main living area, an 18-foot-wide (...) living room and kitchen. Above them, {{the second and third}} stories, both [...] wide, had bedrooms. The wall interiors are faced in brick to better insulate them. The fourth floor, currently empty, was divided between a bedroom and a workshop. Its ceiling has glass inserts to allow light from the lantern to filter down into it. From it a ladder leads up to the watch area and lantern room. The [...] <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> remains there, but its works have been removed. In the cellar are the original coal shed and cistern. A central column carries the cables and [...] weight that rotate the lantern.|$|E
50|$|In 1906 a <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> was {{installed}} {{to help prevent}} such collisions. In 1911 an automated <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> {{was installed}}, sounding a characteristic single stroke every ten seconds.|$|E
5000|$|A wooden {{tower was}} built in 1914 to house a <b>fog</b> <b>bell.</b> The <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> tower was moved in 1920 to a {{position}} closer to the lighthouse. In 1958 a new keeper's house was built, replacing the original dwelling. In the 1960s the lighthouse keeper had a boathouse moved from another lighthouse to the Swallowtail light station. In 1980 the <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> was removed and put {{on display at the}} Grand Manan Museum. The lighthouse was automated and de-staffed in 1986.|$|E
50|$|Lightship 11 {{was built}} in 1853 by Tardy & Auld of Baltimore, Maryland for $13,462.00. Lightship 11 was built of white oak and {{equipped}} with two lanterns and a hand operated 1050 lb <b>bell</b> <b>fog</b> signal. Each of the lanterns contained eight constant-level oil lamps. Lightship 11 was blown ashore in 1855 and rebuilt at the New York Navy Yard for further service at Brenton Reef, Rhode Island.|$|R
50|$|Lightship 54 {{was built}} in 1892 at West Bay City, Michigan for $53,325.00. Lightship 54 was built of iron and {{equipped}} with two lanterns, a 12-inch steam chime whistle, and a hand operated 1000 lb <b>bell</b> <b>fog</b> signal. Each of the lanterns contained eight oil lamps with reflectors. Twenty-five tons of pig iron ballast were added in 1893; and Lightship 54 was transferred to Boston, Massachusetts in 1894.|$|R
50|$|Lightship 1 {{was built}} in 1855 at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for $48,000.00. Lightship 1 was built of white oak and live oak and {{equipped}} with two lanterns and a hand operated <b>bell</b> <b>fog</b> signal. Each of the lanterns contained eight oil lamps with reflectors. Lightship 1 was rebuilt in 1860 and the main anchor was replaced with a mushroom in 1881 and then a stockless mushroom anchor in 1886. Lightship 1 was transferred to Martins Industry, South Carolina in 1892.|$|R

In 1849 Congress extended the light requirements to sailing vessels on US waters. In the UK in 1858 coloured sidelights were recommended for sailing vessels and fog signals were required to be given, by steam vessels on the ships whistle and by sailing vessels on the <b>fog</b> horn or <b>bell,</b> while a separate but similar action was also taken in the United States.|$|R

Reclassified APA-16 February 1, 1943, she continued rehearsals until sailing to San Francisco 16 April to embark troops and their equipment. She sailed on 24 April for Cold Bay, Alaska. Though hampered by heavy seas, her task force arrived off Attu 11 May in a dense <b>fog.</b> J. Franklin <b>Bell,</b> now under Comdr. J.B. McGovern, began landing operations. Submerged rocks, pea soup weather, and narrow, rocky beaches permitted {{only two or three}} boats to be unloaded at a time. Two days later she started unloading around the clock, enabling her to finish the task, embark casualties, and head for home by 16 May.|$|R

The students of philosophy returned, dragging these trophies, including a captured flag, with them. In the afternoon, on the Grands Boulevards, the enthusiasm of the crowd was indescribable. People shouted, kissed, blew on trumpets, and blew the horns of trucks surrounded by the crowds. Any soldier encountered was embraced and carried in triumph. We poor students of rhetoric gave more kisses than we had exchanged during the entire past year.

50|$|In 1882 {{a wooden}} <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> tower was erected, {{and in the}} {{following}} years a keeper's house and various other structures sprung up around the old tower, largely obscuring it. In 1900 a request was made to build a third, taller tower, and as a temporary expedient, a light {{was added to the}} <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> tower, sitting on a platform attached near the top. The replacement light tower was never built, and the converted <b>fog</b> <b>bell</b> tower continues in service. Over the years the 1870 tower, the keeper's house, and the surrounding buildings were all demolished. The tower is readily visible to visitors to the park in which it stands, though it is closed to public access.|$|E
50|$|The keeper's {{house from}} 1833 had a frame kitchen {{addition}} that {{connected to the}} lighthouse, but it was replaced in 1858 with a Gothic Revival gambrel-roofed wood-frame house.
