5|$|Growers {{register}} new daffodil cultivars by {{name and}} color with the Royal Horticultural Society, which is the <b>international</b> <b>registration</b> authority for the genus. Their International Daffodil Register is regularly updated with supplements available online and is searchable. The most recent supplement (2014) is the sixth (the fifth was published in 2012). More than 27,000 names were registered as of 2008, and the number has continued to grow. Registered daffodils are given a division number and colour code such as 5 W-W ("Thalia"). In horticultural usage {{it is common to}} also find an unofficial Division 14: Miniatures, which although drawn from the other 13 divisions, have their miniature size in common. Over 140 varieties have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (See List of Award of Garden Merit narcissus).|$|E
2500|$|The major {{international}} system for facilitating the registration of trademarks in multiple jurisdictions is {{commonly known as}} the [...] "Madrid system". Madrid provides a centrally administered system for securing trademark registrations in member jurisdictions by extending the protection of an [...] "international registration" [...] obtained through the World Intellectual Property Organization. This <b>international</b> <b>registration</b> is in turn based upon an application or registration obtained by a trade mark applicant in its home jurisdiction.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{advantage}} of the Madrid system {{is that it allows}} a trademark owner to obtain trademark protection in many jurisdictions by filing one application in one jurisdiction with one set of fees, and make any changes (e.g. changes of name or address) and renew registration across all applicable jurisdictions through a single administrative process. Furthermore, the [...] "coverage" [...] of the <b>international</b> <b>registration</b> may be extended to additional member jurisdictions at any time.|$|E

50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the Madrid {{system is that}} any refusal, withdrawal or cancellation of the basic application or basic registration within five years of the registration date of the <b>international</b> <b>registration</b> {{will lead to the}} refusal, withdrawal or cancellation of the <b>international</b> <b>registration</b> to the same extent. For example, if a basic application covers 'clothing, headgear and footwear,' and 'headgear' is then deleted from the basic application (for whatever reason), 'headgear' will also be deleted from the international application. Therefore, the protection afforded by the <b>international</b> <b>registration</b> in each designated member jurisdiction will only extend to 'clothing and footwear.' If the basic application is rejected as a whole, the <b>international</b> <b>registration</b> would also be totally refused.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} attacking the basic {{application}} or basic registration {{for this purpose}} is generally known as 'central attack.' Under the Madrid Protocol, {{the effects of a}} successful central attack can be mitigated by transforming the <b>international</b> <b>registration</b> into a series of applications in each jurisdiction designated by the <b>international</b> <b>registration,</b> a process known as 'transformation.' Although transformation is an expensive option of last resort, the resulting applications will receive the registration date of the <b>international</b> <b>registration</b> as their filing date.|$|E
