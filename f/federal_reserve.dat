40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{conditions}} that affected market liquidity during the recent financial crisis, and how this setting resulted in a systemic breakdown in the economy. We also review the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserves</b> actions and provide empirical evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserves</b> unconventional monetary policy in providing market liquidity during the crisis. We use a dataset consisting of an aggregate market liquidity measure and individual program data on the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserves</b> activity to analyze the market impact of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserves</b> balance sheet programs. In baseline regressions we find no statistically significant evidence that the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserves</b> unconventional policies had an impact on market liquidity. However, in asymmetric tests, we find that positive changes in the QE 1 large-scale asset purchase program and the liquidity to key credit markets program had a statistically significant impact on the market liquidity measure...|$|R

50|$|Water {{rights are}} {{generally}} established pursuant to state law, {{but there are}} exceptions, most notably, the concept of <b>federal</b> <b>reserved</b> water rights. <b>Federal</b> <b>reserved</b> water rights are superimposed over state water systems and exhibit several unique characteristics. They are superior {{to the rights of}} subsequent water users, cannot be lost through non-use, and are immune to state-specific standards such as the “beneficial” and “reasonable” use doctrines. Reserved water rights are rights that are established when the <b>federal</b> government <b>reserves</b> land for a specific federal purpose. Courts have held that there is an implied water right to provide the minimum amount of water necessary to effectuate the primary purposes of the reservation http://www.blm.gov/nstc/WaterLaws/fedreservedwater.html. Examples of reservations include Indian reservations, national wildlife refuges, federal forests and military bases. The federal government has also successfully invoked <b>federal</b> <b>reserved</b> water rights for several entities administered by the National Park Service such as Rocky Mountain and Yellowstone National Parks as well as the Red Wild and Scenic River in New Mexico.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the response of}} the term structure of interest rates to weekly money announcements. Estimated responses for both the pre- and post-October 1979 periods are first presented. Then, two competing hypotheses involving the policy anticipations and expected inflation effects are formally specified and compared to the estimated responses. Both hypotheses are found to be consistent with the responses, but they have sharply different implications about the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve's</b> short-run monetary policy. The expected inflation hypothesis implies that weekly money surprises should have persistent effects on the level of the money stock, reflecting shifts in the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve's</b> long-run target. In contrast, the policy anticipations hypothesis implies that the effectof money surprises should diminish over time, reflecting the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve's</b> desire to offset deviations from target. Additional empirical results reported in the paper support this latter description of the money stock process. ...|$|R
