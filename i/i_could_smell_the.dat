60|$|Already <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> {{smoke that}} was {{pouring out of}} the cracks around the hatchway. It {{would not be a}} great while before the entire vessel would be consumed.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a shame!" [...] he said, {{bending down}} to stroke {{her hand and}} her arm. She drew back smiling, {{flushing}} with joy. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> white lilies where I sat.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> raw whiskey on the mate's breath. Yet {{he did not}} stagger nor {{show any}} signs of intoxication. Not until {{afterward}} was I to know that his willingness to talk was most unwonted and was where the liquor gave him away.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{stared at}} the old hunter and {{likewise}} sniffed. I followed their lead, but all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> was <b>the</b> thick, piney odor of the forest.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>smelled</b> <b>the</b> new-mown hay if it wasn't {{that when}} you're in Geisenheimer's {{you have to}} smell Geisenheimer's, because it leaves no chance for competition.|$|R
60|$|A {{mile and}} a half it must have been to our journey's end. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hear nothing but the fearful rattle of the ancient hack over the uneven brick paving; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> nothing but <b>the</b> drizzle, now further flavored with coal smoke and {{something}} like a mixture of tar and oleander blossoms. All <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see through the streaming windows were two rows of dim houses.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had fever, you know, but {{the thing}} was remarkably real. It was like lantern {{pictures}} melting on the screen. Background and figures were accurate and lifelike. In the last scene, I knew I was in Columbine's cabin and can hardly persuade myself I was quite asleep. The tide splashed about the boat; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> mud." ...|$|E
60|$|Once {{more she}} leaned towards me. The {{wind was blowing}} around us, she came closer as though seeking for the shelter of my body. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> crushed violets, which she was still wearing at her bosom; her eyes were soft and bright, her lips were {{slightly}} parted. I took her into my arms--she clung {{to me for a}} moment--one long, delicious moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Miss Patsey!" [...] she said, [...] "If you'd been a-coming to me {{with them}} violets and buttercups, instead of old Hans with his nasty bitter yarbs, I'd a been off that bed many a day ago. There was nothing but darkness, and the shadows of tomb-stones, and the damp smells of the lonely bogs about his roots and his leaves. But there was the heavenly {{sunshine}} in your flowers, Miss Patsey, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> sweet fields, when I looked at them, and hear {{the hum of the}} bees!" ...|$|E
50|$|I thought I {{was a big}} shot. Big money, big house, big car...I thought I held all the cards. <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{pick the}} winner every time, <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> it...but <b>the</b> whole thing was built on garbage. I treated my wife badly and I knew it and I didn't stop and one day she walked. She took my {{daughter}} with her. I started gambling big time, crazy stuff, long shot stuff. I turned {{into the kind of}} man that I'd grown up hating. Making the big bucks and being made a partner wasn't enough to buy that off. I'm just kinda starting from scratch, trying to keep things low pressure.|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep a tight line!" [...] I cautioned, as I {{backed the}} canoe hard {{with all my}} power. It {{was not easy to}} go {{backward}} and keep head on to the wind. The waves broke over the end of the canoe, splashing me in the face so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> taste and <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> salt. I made half a dozen shoves with the paddle. Then, nearing the piece of seaweed, I dropped my anchor.|$|R
40|$|Paul Lelaud France 1942 - 1944 I couldn't see {{the four}} fires, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> them, <b>the</b> scent of burning {{paraffin}} and wood coming thickly in waves of smoke across the field. My heart started thumping again. Surely if we <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> fires, others <b>could</b> as well. A German patrol would smell them for sure! Then I {{was aware of}} a large shape looming up in the night sky, its wings wide. It was the biggest thing I had ever seen. There were no lights showing on it. Down, down, down it came, lower and lower. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{hear the sound of}} its engine slowing and I thought with alarm, "If it goes any slower it will crash in the field, and what will we do then? Paul Leland is a 13 -year-old boy living in rural France. He has been living under Nazi occupation since 1940. Working with the Resistance cell in his village, Paul is a crucial figure in the 'escape route' for allied POWs and agents...|$|R
60|$|A {{few days}} ago one of the six-story {{clothing}} stores along here had the space inside its plate-glass show-window partition'd into a little corral, and litter'd deeply with rich clover and hay, (<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> odor outside,) on which reposed two magnificent fat sheep, full-sized but young--the handsomest creatures of the kind I ever saw. I stop's long and long, with the crowd, to view them--one lying down chewing the cud, and one standing up, looking out, with dense-fringed patient eyes. Their wool, of a clear tawny color, with streaks of glistening black--altogether a queer sight amidst that crowded promenade of dandies, dollars and dry-goods.|$|E
6000|$|It is astonishing--and I {{have heard}} many {{make the same}} remark--how acute one's senses become at such a crisis as this. I am {{convinced}} that at no moment is one living so vividly, so acutely, as at the instant when a violent and foreseen death overtakes one. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> resinous fagots, I could see every twig upon the ground, I could hear every rustle of the branches, as I have never smelled or seen or heard save at such times of danger. And {{so it was that}} long before anyone else, before even the time when the chief had addressed me, I had heard a low, monotonous sound, far away indeed, and yet coming nearer at every instant. At first it was but a murmur, a rumble, {{but by the time he}} had finished speaking, while the assassins were untying my ankles in order to lead me to the scene of my murder, I heard, as plainly as ever I heard anything in my life, the clinking of horseshoes and the jingling of bridle-chains, with the clank of sabres against stirrup-irons. Is it likely that I, who had lived with the light cavalry since the first hair shaded my lip, would mistake the sound of troopers on the march? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was destined}} to make rather a queer {{discovery}} when I {{went over to the}} cattle-slaughter. All the buildings here were on a much larger scale, and there was no sound of trouble, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> salt reek of blood before I set foot in the place. The cattle did not come directly through the viaduct as the pigs had done. They debouched into a yard by the hundred, and they were big red brutes carrying much flesh. In the centre of that yard stood a red Texan steer with a headstall on his wicked head. No man controlled him. He was, so to speak, picking his teeth and whistling in an open byre of his own when the cattle arrived. As soon as the first one had fearfully quitted the viaduct, this red devil put {{his hands in his pockets}} and slouched across the yard, no man guiding him. Then he lowed something to the effect that he was the regularly appointed guide of the establishment and would show them round. They were country folk, but they knew how to behave; and so followed Judas some hundred strong, patiently, and with a look of bland wonder in their faces. I saw his broad back jogging in advance of them, up a lime-washed incline where I was forbidden to follow. Then a door shut, and in a minute back came Judas with the air of a virtuous plough-bullock and took up his place in his byre. Somebody laughed across the yard, but I heard no sound of cattle from the big brick building into which the mob had disappeared. Only Judas chewed the cud with a malignant satisfaction, and so I knew there was trouble, and ran round to the front of the factory and so entered and stood aghast.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{picked up}} a school of mullet before I'd been rowing five minutes. Fine big fat ones they were, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> them over <b>the</b> fire. When I stood up, fire-stick in one hand, {{dynamite}} stick in the other, my knees were knocking together. Maybe it was the gin, or the anxiousness, or the weakness and the hunger, and {{maybe it was the}} result of all of them, but at any rate I was all of a shake. Twice I failed to touch the fire-stick to the dynamite. Then I did, heard the match-head splutter, and let her go.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> like him," [...] {{the captain}} said to the mate, [...] "there wouldn't be any risk at all of my ever losing my head." ...|$|R
60|$|He was {{so close}} that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> him. His quick little eyes snapped fire and fear at once; he uttered a sound that was between a whine and a growl.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Winnipeg Review, “By {{the end of}} the novel, {{the painful}} {{experiences}} of Adut and Sandra left me haunted, as Schnell tells her story with such clarity that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> blood on their clothes and feel the hot sun beating down above them.” ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2016, Hanning {{was convicted}} in a court in Detmold, Germany, of 170,000 counts of being an {{accessory}} to murder. Several Holocaust survivors testified against him. In court, Hanning said, [...] "People were shot, gassed and burned. I could see how corpses were taken back and forth or moved out. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> burning bodies." [...] During the trial, Hanning apologized for doing nothing to prevent the Holocaust atrocities he witnessed at Auschwitz saying [...] "I am ashamed that I saw injustice and never did anything about it, and I apologize for my actions,” but denied the charges.|$|E
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 As I closed {{and locked the}} door of my little country store for the last time, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> foliage on that warm, balmy evening. After I turned the key in the lock, I stared at the weathered, white {{exterior}} of the building I had worked in for 27 years. 2 ̆...|$|E
50|$|The Sarson's Vinegar factory was {{situated}} in Tanner Street in Bermondsey, London, {{on the southern}} approach to Tower Bridge, where you <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> aroma of the vinegar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poisoned with gases, I suppose," [...] Meyer {{answered}} with a groan, for his head was aching sadly. [...] "The air is often bad {{at the bottom of}} deep wells, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> or feel nothing until suddenly my senses left me. It was a near thing--a very near thing." ...|$|R
60|$|The exact {{locality}} of {{the fire}} was plain {{to him as he}} neared home. He soon could hear the shout of men, the flapping of the flames, the crackling of burning wood, and <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> smoke from the conflagration.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the unit}} was {{originally}} {{located in the}} top floor of 'F' block patients often used to complain that they <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> beer and think that they were going mad. Little did they know that [...] "The Bees Knees" [...] pub was in located nearby in the basement below 'G' block - They really <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> beer.|$|R
6000|$|... "The boy hid the bad pumpkin {{behind him}} till {{his mother was}} gone, because he didn't want her in the secret; and then he slipped into the house, and put it under his bed. It was pretty lonesome {{up there in the}} boy's room--he slept in the garret, and there was nothing but broken {{furniture}} besides his bed; but all day long it <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> good little pumpkin, boiling and boiling for pies; and late at night, after the boy had gone to sleep, it <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> hot pies when they came out of the oven. They smelt splendid, but the bad little pumpkin didn't envy them a bit; it just said, 'Pooh! What's twenty pumpkin pies to one pumpkin-glory?'" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1943, {{apparently}} {{concerned about}} leaving evidence behind, Himmler ordered that the bodies at Rumbula be dug up and burned. [...] (Similar actions were taken at Belzec extermination camp in German occupied Poland.) [...] This {{work was done}} by a detachment of Jewish slave laborers. [...] Persons travelling on <b>the</b> railway <b>could</b> readily <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> burning corpses. In 2001, the President of the Republic of Latvia, Vaira Vike-Freiberga, who was a child during World War II, spoke at a 60-year anniversary memorial service about {{the destruction of the}} bodies: [...] "We <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> smoke coming from Rumbula, where corpses were being dug up and burnt to erase the evidence." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fellow Australian musician, Paul Kelly {{recalled}} {{hearing the}} {{song for the}} first time while driving in Melbourne: My skin started tingling, and I had to pull over ... it had an odd, jerky time signature which acted as a little trip-switch into another world - weird and heavenly and deeply familiar all at once ... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> that song ... What planet was this from? When did The Stranglers go to northern Queensland and get all arty? ...|$|R
60|$|Siegmund, rebuffed by {{the only}} one in the house from whom he might have {{expected}} friendship, proceeded slowly to shave, feeling sick at heart. He was a long time over his toilet. When he stripped himself for the bath, it seemed to him he <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> sea. He bent his head and licked his shoulder. It tasted decidedly salt.|$|R
60|$|Alf's rigorously limited {{powers of}} comprehending Torpenhow"s special {{correspondence}} had waked the devil of unrest in Dick. He could hear, through the boy's nasal chant, the camels grunting in the squares behind the soldiers outside Suakin; {{could hear the}} men swearing and chaffing across the cooking pots, and <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> acrid wood-smoke as it drifted over camp before the wind of the desert.|$|R
60|$|An early moon silvered {{the long}} slopes of wheat {{and made the}} alfalfa squares seem black. A cool, faint, sweet breeze fanned her cheek. She <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> {{fragrance}} of apples, of new-mown hay, and {{she could hear the}} low murmur of running water. A hound bayed off somewhere in the fields. There was no other sound. It was a quiet, beautiful, pastoral scene. But somehow it did not comfort Lenore.|$|R
60|$|When Kit {{was half}} {{way across the}} alameda he stopped and looked about. Dark trees rose against <b>the</b> sky; he <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> {{eucalyptus}} and their thin shadows covered {{the ground with a}} quivering, open pattern. There was a pool of moonlight, and farther on the solid, fan-shaped reflections of palms. Nobody was near him, although he heard voices across the alameda, and he stood for a few moments, thinking, while his heart beat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I call it doosid stale old rappee," [...] says Mr. Brummell--(as for me <b>I</b> declare <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>smell</b> {{anything}} at all in either of the boxes.) [...] "Old boy in smock-frock, take a pinch?" ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{aromatic}} <b>smell</b> of sassafras {{was described}} by early European settlers arriving in North America. According to one legend, Christopher Columbus found North America because he <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> scent of sassafras. As early as the 1560s, French visitors to North America discovered the medicinal qualities of sassafras, which was also exploited by the Spanish who arrived in Florida. English settlers at Roanoke reported surviving on boiled sassafras leaves and dog meat during times of starvation.|$|R
60|$|Then, silently, on {{infinitely}} careful feet, he {{went along}} the passage, feeling {{the wall with}} the extreme tips of his fingers. There was a door. He stood and listened. He could hear two people's breathing. It was not that. He went stealthily forward. There was another door, slightly open. The room was in darkness. Empty. Then there was <b>the</b> bathroom, he <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> soap and the heat. Then at the end another bedroom--one soft breathing. This was she.|$|R
40|$|The urinary {{excretion}} of (an) odorous substance(s) {{after eating}} asparagus {{is not an}} inborn error of metabolism as has been supposed. The detection of the odour constitutes a specific smell hypersensitivity. Those who <b>could</b> <b>smell</b> <b>the</b> odour in their own urine <b>could</b> all <b>smell</b> it in <b>the</b> urine of anyone who had eaten asparagus, {{whether or not that}} person was able to smell it himself. Thresholds for detecting the odour appeared to be bimodal in distribution, with 10 % of 307 subjects tested able to smell it at high dilutions, suggesting a genetically determined specific hypersensitivity...|$|R
