25|$|The most {{important}} aspect of this craft was the paddle wheel. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> idea – supposedly dating to antiquities – and previously tried with a steam engine. Jonathan Hulls of England used a rear-mounted paddle wheel in 1737 but an inefficient method of turning the steam engine’s reciprocating motion into the circular motion hobbled it. In 1789, Nathan Reed of Massachusetts experimented with a paddle wheel, and considered patenting it, but eventually patented a different method instead. The American John Fitch experimented with side-mounted paddle wheels, but in 1791 used and patented oars instead. Morey's may have been the first successful use of a steam power paddle wheel, which was the best method of propulsion until the propeller, invented by Fitch, was perfected.|$|E
25|$|On the Sutton Road, {{a number}} of houses were {{demolished}} in 1957 {{for the construction of}} the Lyndhurst Estate. Number 44 was retained as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> building considered to be of interest. The demolished houses were detached post 1840 Victorian villas. Constructed on the site were six tower blocks and numerous low rise maisonettes. The tallest of these, Harlech Tower, was 16 storeys and {{at the time it was}} the tallest tower block in Birmingham, though many taller blocks were later built. In 1961, the estate won the Civic Award for Housing for the retention of the original trees from the villas and the architectural qualities of the tower blocks which included an exposed concrete frame, a sweeping staircase and a false upper storey to hide the laundry facilities on the roof.|$|E

Production ended in April 1979, as Suzuki {{was getting ready to}} introduce their new generation of front-wheel drive kei cars.

2500|$|The {{confidence}} in Augustinussen was strongly expressed {{during his first}} term as mayor, since he also [...] "worked as the municipality's administrator". <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> practice that the village's pastor would manage the poor relief fund and the municipal treasury, but when Krogh left Nesna in 1841, the formannskap agreed to a different arrangement. Johan Augustinussen was employed as treasurer with responsibilities for the poor relief fund, with a wage of two Spd. per year. He was also responsible for the school treasury in Nesna (but not Dønnes) with a wage of one Spd. per year. This agreement {{was made by the}} formannskap where Augustinussen was himself one of the three members, but according to Jenssen no one saw [...] "anything suspicious about this". Jenssen further notes that Augustinussen's accounts were always in [...] "exemplary order" [...] in contrast to the accounts of the school treasury in Dønnes, for which he was not responsible. The wage increased over the years, and in 1876 he received 30 Spd. per year for the supervision of the poor relief fund. Augustinussen was the municipal treasurer until he became a pensioner in 1878; when previous mayor Jacob Fredrik Zahl overtook the position. Zahl was succeeded by Ivar Anton Ivarsen Mehus in 1883, who was also a successor of Augustinussen in a different capacity in 1884, when he became Nesna's second parliamentary representative.|$|E

2500|$|The minstrels' dance styles, on {{the other}} hand, were much truer to their alleged source. The success of [...] "Jump Jim Crow" [...] is indicative: <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> English tune with fairly {{standard}} lyrics, which leaves only Rice's dance—wild upper-body movements with little movement below the waist—to explain its popularity. Dances like the Turkey Trot, the Buzzard Lope, and the Juba dance all had their origins in the plantations of the South, and some were popularized by black performers such as William Henry Lane, Signor Cornmeali ("Old Corn Meal"), and John [...] "Picayune" [...] Butler. One performance by Lane in 1842 was described as consisting of [...] "sliding steps, like a shuffle, and not the high steps of an Irish jig." [...] Lane and the white men who mimicked him moved about the stage with no obvious foot movement. The walk around, a common feature of the minstrel show's first act, was ultimately of West African origin and featured a competition between individuals hemmed in by the other minstrels. Elements of white tradition remained, of course, such as the fast-paced breakdown that formed part of the repertoire beginning with Rice. Minstrel dance was generally not held to the same mockery as other parts, although contemporaries such as Fanny Kemble argued that minstrel dances were merely a [...] "faint, feeble, impotent—in a word, pale Northern reproductions of that ineffable black conception." ...|$|E
2500|$|For the , the Prince {{was given}} the name Dastan. According to Mechner, he chose the name as he had learned <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> Persian name meaning [...] "trickster". Dastan was portrayed by American actor Jake Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal {{said that there were}} several reasons that he chose to accept the role of the Prince, {{including}} the character's appeal to him, the fact that the film was based on the video game, and he [...] " [...] to do things that people have tried their hand at and haven't succeeded." [...] According to Gyllenhaal, he retrospectively felt he had over-prepared physically for his role as he knew little of what it entailed. He trained for five months prior to the beginning of filming in Morocco, and continued to train during the filming period. Despite the original script being written prior to the making of later games in the Sands of Time continuity, Mechner said that the production team for the film incorporated design elements from later games into the Prince's appearance. An element pointed out by staff is the Prince's appearance in the film's opening and climax, which was inspired by the Prince as he appeared in Warrior Within. The character's costumes were designed by Penny Rose. The Prince's most worn outfit, a loose-fitting spiral coat, was designed by her based on a picture from a piece of ancient Persian embroidery. Her costumes also made nods to the costume designs of the video games.|$|E
