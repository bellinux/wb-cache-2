25|$|In the 1950s, Northern Kazakh SSR oblasts {{became a}} {{territory}} of the Virgin Lands Campaign led by Nikita Khrushchev, in order to turn the region into a second <b>grain</b> <b>producer</b> for the Soviet Union. In December 1960, Central Committee made a resolution to create the Tselinniy Krai, which comprised five regions of the Northern Kazakh SSR oblasts. Akmolinsk Oblast was ceased to exist as a separate administrative entity. Its districts were directly subordinated to the new krai administration, and Akmolinsk became the krai capital, {{as well as the}} administrative seat of the new Virgin Lands economic region. On 14 March 1961, Khrushchev proposed to rename the city to name corresponding to its role in the Virgin Lands Campaign. On 20 March 1961, the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh SSR renamed Akmolinsk to Tselinograd. On 24 April 1961, the region was reconstituted as Tselinograd Oblast. In the 1960s, Tselinograd was completely transformed. In 1963, work on the first three new high-rise housing districts began. In addition, the city received a number of new monumental public buildings, including the Virgin Lands Palace, a Palace of Youth, a House of Soviets, a new airport, and several sports venues. In 1971, the Tselinniy Krai was abolished and Tselinograd became the centre of the oblast.|$|E

40|$|The organic {{industry}} in Canada is growing and Alberta organic <b>grain</b> <b>producers</b> have expressed {{a concern that}} the marketing system for organic grains in Alberta is poorly organized. This poorly organized system may hinder producers from optimizing market potential. This paper assesses different organizational structures that might assist Alberta organic <b>grain</b> <b>producers</b> in optimizing market potential. The choice of organizational structures that could potentially be used to market organic grain in Alberta {{is based on the}} types organizational structures that currently exist in the market, producer motivations, and the obstacles that exist in the market. In performing the assessment; existing organic organizational structures are identified, producer motivations are defined, underlying market forces are revealed, and organizational critical success factors are specified. In the conclusions an assessment is made as to which organizational structure is presently the most suitable option to assist organic <b>grain</b> <b>producers</b> in Alberta. The judgment of appropriate marketing structure may well change as the organic market matures, which it shows promise of rapidly doing. Industrial Organization, Marketing,...|$|R

50|$|The Mughals {{launched}} a vast economic development {{project in the}} Bengal delta which transformed its demographic makeup. The government cleared vast swathes of forest in the fertile Bhati region to expand farmland. It encouraged settlers, including farmers and jagirdars, to populate the delta.

5000|$|The main {{sources of}} the economy are agriculture, {{with a focus on}} soy, corn and cotton production, as well as {{refrigerators}} and industries, such as soybean crushing, biodiesel and corn processing.

50|$|The {{removal of}} the Crow Rate, which covered the cost of {{shipping}} grain, left farmers having to pay to ship their grains to world markets. It became more economical for <b>grain</b> <b>producers</b> to ship to large terminals along the main line. This brought about the closure and demolition of many wooden grain elevators along the line to Shaunavon. In the late 1990s, the CPR announced its intentions to sell the track leading to the southwest to WestCan Rail, a railway salvage operation. Action was swift. <b>Grain</b> <b>Producers</b> formed a coalition to lobby WestCan Rail. A deal was made that formed the Great Western Railway to run the line as a shortline with the eventual plans to purchase the railway back from WestCan Rail. Meanwhile, producers purchased the remaining standing wooden grain elevators in Shaunavon, Admiral, Eastend, Ponteix and Neville.|$|R

It is also the national leader in the production of rapeseed and peas. Wheat production {{is by far the most}} dominant in the area.

In 1905 AD, Captain R. E. A. Hamilton completed the first settlement of Poonch.

5000|$|Although the Commonwealth was Europe's largest <b>grain</b> <b>producer,</b> {{the bulk}} of her grain was {{consumed}} domestically. Estimated grain consumption in the Polish Crown (Poland proper) and Prussia in 1560-70 was some 113,000 tons of wheat (or 226,000 łaszt - a łaszt, or [...] "last", being a large bulk measure; {{in the case of}} grain, about half a ton). Average yearly production of grain in the Commonwealth in the 16th Century was 120,000 tons, 6% of which was exported, while cities consumed some 19% and the remainder was consumed by the villages. Commonwealth grain achieved far more importance in poor crop years, as in the early 1590s and the 1620s, when governments throughout southern Europe arranged for large grain imports to cover shortfalls in their jurisdictions.|$|E

40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the evaluation of}} alternative pricing strategies involving options on feed grains futures contracts {{during the period of}} 1973 - 1986. To predict the option premiums that would have occurred at various points in this time period, the study did research on market premiums of options on corn futures contracts from March 1, 1985 until December 31, 1985. The research showed that market premiums conformed closely to the premiums estimated by Black model of options pricing. The generalized stochastic dominance with absolute risk aversion function intervals is applied in the study in order to evaluate the strategies. The results showed that under different risk preferences, (DARA and CARA), the commodity options strategies dominate the cash sale strategy, but do not dominate the hedging by selling futures contract strategy. Options may provide alternatives for feed <b>grains</b> <b>producers</b> and traders. Put (call) options provided protection from losses resulting from falling (raising) cash price and may somtimes raise average income/margin of feed <b>grain</b> <b>producers</b> and traders...|$|R
