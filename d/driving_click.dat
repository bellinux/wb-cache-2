40|$|I {{think that}} the concept of website {{morphing}} might be a bit broader than that presented by Hauser et al. (2009). Their definition says that morphing matches {{the look and feel of}} a website to cognitive styles, but the way they learn about the cognitive style is by observing the click stream, so a more general defini-tion would be that morphing matches the look and feel of a website to the clickstream. Cognitive style could be one interpretation of what is <b>driving</b> <b>click</b> behavior, although it is not the only interpretation. Suppose, for example, that gender is an important characteristic to an advertiser, and that men click on different things than women. After a few clicks, one might be able to predict the gender of the visitor with reasonable accuracy and morph th...|$|E

40|$|Importance New {{dissemination}} {{methods are}} needed to engage physicians in evidence-based continuing medical education (CME). Objective To examine the effectiveness of social media in engaging physicians in non-industry-sponsored CME. Design We tested the effect of different media platforms (e-mail, Facebook, paid Facebook and Twitter), CME topics, and different “hooks” (e. g., Q 2 ̆ 6 A, clinical pearl and best evidence) on <b>driving</b> <b>clicks</b> to a landing site featuring non-industry sponsored CME. We modelled the effects of social media platform, CME topic, and hook using negative binomial regression on clicks to a single landing site. We used clicks to landing site adjusted for exposure and message number to calculate rate ratios. To understand how physicians interact with CME content on social media, we also conducted interviews with 10 physicians. Setting The National Physicians Alliance (NPA) membership. Participants NPA e-mail recipients, Facebook followers and friends, and Twitter followers. Main Outcomes and Measures Clicks to the NPA’s CME landing site. Results On average, 4, 544 recipients received each message. Messages generated a total of 592 clicks to the landing site, for a rate of 5. 4 clicks per 1000 recipients exposed. There were 5. 4 clicks from e-mail, 11. 9 clicks from Facebook, 5. 5 clicks from paid Facebook, and 6. 9 clicks from Twitter to the landing site for 1000 physicians exposed to each of 4 selected CME modules. A Facebook post generated 2. 3 x as many clicks to the landing site as did an e-mail after controlling for participant exposure, hook type and CME topic (p Conclusions Social media has a modest impact on driving traffic to evidence-based CME options. Facebook had a superior effect on driving physician web traffic to evidence-based CME compared to other social media platforms and email...|$|R

A Facebook post generated 2. 3 x as many clicks to the landing site as did an e-mail after controlling for participant exposure, hook type and CME topic (p< 0. 001). Twitter posts (p = 0. 13) and paid Facebook posts (p = 0. 06) were not statistically different from e-mail in generating clicks to the landing site. Use of different hooks to engage physicians had no impact on clicks to the landing site.
