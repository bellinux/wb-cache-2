II required an ever-increasing number of sub-models, each turned to different frequencies. By 1941 {{it was clear that}} this was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> without bound, and a new solution was needed. The result was a new series of IFF units which used the indirect interrogation technique. These operated on a fixed frequency, different from the radar. The interrogation signal was sent from the aircraft by pressing a button on the radar, which caused the signal to be sent out in pulses synchronized to the radar's main signal. The received signal was amplified and mixed into the same video signal as the radar, causing the same extended blip to appear.|$|E

I felt that if I took the public into consideration at all, I wasn’t <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> and I wasn’t going to learn.
