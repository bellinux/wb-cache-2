5000|$|The {{generic term}} <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> was in use before 1981, applied {{as early as}} 1972 to the Xerox PARC's Alto, {{but because of the}} success of the IBM <b>Personal</b> <b>Computer,</b> the term [...] "PC" [...] came to mean more {{specifically}} a desktop microcomputer compatible with IBM's <b>Personal</b> <b>Computer</b> branded products. Within a short time of the introduction, third-party suppliers of peripheral devices, expansion cards, and software proliferated; the influence of the IBM PC on the <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> market was substantial in standardizing a platform for <b>personal</b> <b>computers.</b> [...] "IBM compatible" [...] became an important criterion for sales growth; after the 1980s, only the Apple Macintosh family kept significant market share without compatibility with the IBM <b>personal</b> <b>computer.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} the <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> as a mass-market {{consumer}} electronic device began with the microcomputer revolution of the 1980s. The 1981 launch of the IBM <b>Personal</b> <b>Computer</b> coined both the term <b>Personal</b> <b>Computer</b> and PC. A <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> is one intended for interactive individual use,, {{as opposed to a}} mainframe computer where the end user's requests are filtered through operating staff, or a time-sharing system in which one large processor is shared by many individuals. After the development of the microprocessor, individual <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> were low enough in cost that they eventually became affordable consumer goods. Early <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> - generally called microcomputers - were sold often in electronic kit form and in limited numbers, and were of interest mostly to hobbyists and technicians.|$|R

40|$|A two-phased study {{investigating}} {{the role of}} attitudes and beliefs {{in the use of}} <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> was conducted in 9 organizations. During the first phase a questionnaire was administered to 278 knowledge workers within one organization. The measurement scale items were tested and revised slightly, and the research model tested also. In the second phase, the revised questionnaire was administered to 364 knowledge workers (80 % gross response rate) in 8 diverse organizations. The measures and research model were tested using Partial Least Squares. Nine of eleven hypothesized relations were supported statistically, and 38 % of the variance was explained in the major dependent variable, utilization. The general findings were: (1) There were three distinct components of attitudes identified which relate to the utilization of <b>personal</b> <b>computers,</b> including (a) job-related expectations of use, (b) correspondence between job tasks and <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> use, and (c) general beliefs about <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> use (difficulty, time requirements). (2) Of the different attitude components, only correspondence had a significant influence on <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> utilization. (3) Experience with <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> strongly influenced all three components of attitudes, and also influenced the utilization of <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> directly. (4) Management support had a positive influence on expectations and general beliefs about <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> use, but there was no direct relation between management support and utilization. (5) A strong relation was observed between the utilization of <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> and related aspects of performance.;The implications of the findings for practitioners are that organizations wishing to increase the amount and effectiveness of <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> use by knowledge workers should stress the potential correspondence between the <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> environment and current job tasks. As the experience level with <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> increases, further applications for job tasks are discovered and utilization increases. The cycle repeats itself, with increased use and experience leading to greater appreciation of the correspondence between job tasks and the <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> environment. For researchers, the results confirmed the need to examine separate components of attitudes within the context of system utilization. Also, the measures which were developed and tested are appropriate for future research...|$|R

40|$|The net {{harmonic}} currents {{generated by}} a cluster of desktop <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> are studied statistically. <b>Personal</b> <b>computers</b> (PCs) are single-phase non-linear loads with low individual consumption but significant collective distortion effects, {{as many of them}} can be connected to the same bus (<b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> cluster). This article reports experimental measurements of harmonic currents injected by single-phase rectifiers and seven <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> types during four operating modes. The probability density functions (pdfs) of the harmonic currents (magnitude and phase angle) are investigated from the measurements. An analytical procedure to obtain these probability density functions for any typical <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> working session is described and experimentally validated. The obtained probability density functions are found to be applicable to large-scale harmonic penetration statistical studies. Furthermore, attenuation and diversity effects are analyzed from the previous probability density functions, and the harmonic current cancellation effect on <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> clusters is investigated with Monte Carlo simulations.
