50|$|The {{presence}} of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) influences {{the number of}} cloud drops that form in a cloud; the more CCN there are, the more cloud droplets that will form. Changes in the CCN concentration and their associated changes in the cloud <b>drop</b> <b>distribution</b> can redistribute the energy within a hurricane. This was known in the 1960s which lead scientists to think that hurricanes could be modified {{by the addition of}} CCN to produce less intense hurricanes. It was proposed that by seeding with silver iodide outside the eyewall would freeze the supercooled water, release more latent heat, and increase convection. This method was ultimately unsuccessful {{because of the lack of}} supercooled water in the tropical cyclone. A different approach seeds the clouds with a large number of small hygroscopic aerosols. The large number of CCN leads to smaller raindrops, less collision-coalescence, and thus less rainout. This water is convected above the freezing level, leading to warming in the upper atmosphere and greater convection.|$|E

Cooling tower {{rain zone}} {{performance}} {{characteristics such as}} the loss coefficient and the Merkel number are evaluated and simulated. To this end the influence of drop diameter and drop deformation on the velocity, path length and cooling of single water drops are investigated. Experimental drop size and pressure drop data over a counterflow rain zone are presented {{and the effect of}} drop deformation on the pressure drop is investigated using the experimental data and CFD. Using the experimental drop size data and CFD, the performance uncertainty produced by using the Rosin-Rammler <b>drop</b> <b>distribution</b> function as opposed to the discrete <b>drop</b> <b>distribution</b> data is investigated.

40|$|Stress drop, {{a measure}} of static stress change in earthquakes, {{is the subject of}} {{numerous}} investigations. Stress drop in an earthquake is likely to be spatially varying over the fault, creating a stress <b>drop</b> <b>distribution.</b> Representing this spatial distribution by a single number, as commonly done, implies averaging in space. In this study, we investigate similarities and differences between three different averages of the stress <b>drop</b> <b>distribution</b> used in earthquake studies. The first one, Δσ¯¯¯¯¯M, is the commonly estimated stress drop based on the seismic moment and fault geometry/dimensions. It is known that Δσ¯¯¯¯¯M corresponds to averaging the stress <b>drop</b> <b>distribution</b> with the slip distribution due to uniform stress drop as the weighting function. The second one, Δσ¯¯¯¯¯A, is the simplest (unweighted) average of the stress <b>drop</b> <b>distribution</b> over the fault, equal to the difference between the average stress levels on the fault before and after an earthquake. The third one, Δσ¯¯¯¯¯E, enters discussions of energy partitioning and radiation efficiency; we show that it corresponds to averaging the stress <b>drop</b> <b>distribution</b> with the actual final slip at each point as the weighting function. The three averages, Δσ¯¯¯¯¯M, Δσ¯¯¯¯¯A, and Δσ¯¯¯¯¯E, are often used interchangeably in earthquake studies and simply called ‘stress drop’. Yet they are equal to each other only for ruptures with spatially uniform stress drop, which results in an elliptical slip distribution for a circular rupture. Indeed, we find that other relatively simple slip shapes—such as triangular, trapezoidal or sinusoidal—already result in stress drop distributions with notable differences between Δσ¯¯¯¯¯M, Δσ¯¯¯¯¯A, and Δσ¯¯¯¯¯E. Introduction of spatial slip heterogeneity results in further systematic differences between them, with Δσ¯¯¯¯¯E always being larger than Δσ¯¯¯¯¯M, a fact that we have proven theoretically, and Δσ¯¯¯¯¯A almost always being the smallest. In particular, the value of the energy-related Δσ¯¯¯¯¯E significantly increases in comparison to the moment-based Δσ¯¯¯¯¯M with increasing roughness of the slip distribution over the fault. Previous studies used Δσ¯¯¯¯¯M in place of Δσ¯¯¯¯¯E in computing the radiation ratio ηR that compares the radiated energy in earthquakes to a characteristic part of their strain energy change. Typical values of ηR for large earthquakes were found to be from 0. 25 to 1. Our finding that Δσ¯¯¯¯¯E≥Δσ¯¯¯¯¯M allows us to interpret the values of ηR as the upper bound. We determine the restrictions placed by such estimates on the evolution of stress with slip at the earthquake source. We also find that Δσ¯¯¯¯¯E can be approximated by Δσ¯¯¯¯¯M if the latter is computed based on a reduced rupture area...|$|E

Therefore {{the influence of the}} atomization process on the breakup of oil drops inside the emulsion is investigated. It is expected that the oil <b>drop</b> size <b>distribution</b> of the emulsion is influenced by the stress inside the nozzle orifice and the following atomization. According to Grace the viscosity ratio between disperse and continuous phase is a crucial factor for drop breakup. A model oil-in-water emulsion was used. The viscosity of the continuous phase was adjusted by adding maltodextrin or gelatinized corn starch thus varying the viscosity ratio in the range between 15 and 0. 1. The dry matter content and corresponding viscosity show only low influence on the spray <b>drop</b> size <b>distribution.</b> However, the atomized emulsions contain mostly smaller oil drops compared to the original emulsions. The influence of the atomization on the oil <b>drop</b> size <b>distribution</b> decrease with decreasing viscosity ratios.

The viscosity ratio thus allows controlling the influence of the atomization on the oil <b>drop</b> size <b>distribution</b> in the spray.

In this paper, we present a PBE model accounting for multiple drop breakage and show that the model provides superior distribution predictions reflected by decrease in least-squares objective function for an oil-in-water emulsion processed in a pilot-scale high-pressure homogenizer. Following our previous work, two distinct rate functions for drop breakage, one due to turbulent eddies and another due to turbulent shear were used to reproduce the measured bimodal distributions.

The PBE model with multiple drop breakage was shown to provide superior distribution predictions compared to the analogous binary breakage PBE model when adjustable model parameters were determined by nonlinear optimization.
