5|$|Horses require routine {{hoof care}} from a farrier, {{as well as}} vaccinations to protect against various diseases, and dental {{examinations}} from a veterinarian or a specialized equine dentist. If horses are kept inside in a barn, they require regular daily exercise for their physical health and mental well-being. When turned outside, they require well-maintained, sturdy fences to be safely contained. Regular grooming {{is also helpful to}} help the horse maintain good health of the <b>hair</b> <b>coat</b> and underlying skin.|$|E
5|$|After the Dutch {{settlement}} of South Africa began, the quagga was heavily hunted as it competed with domesticated animals for forage. While some individuals {{were taken to}} zoos in Europe, breeding programs were unsuccessful. The last wild population lived in the Orange Free State, and the quagga was extinct in the wild by 1878. The last captive specimen died in Amsterdam on 12 August 1883. Only one quagga was ever photographed alive and only 23 skins are preserved today. In 1984, the quagga was the first extinct animal to have its DNA analysed, and the Quagga Project is trying to recreate the phenotype of <b>hair</b> <b>coat</b> pattern and related characteristics by selectively breeding Burchell's zebras.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} rare solid-colored horse (usually bay or black), most Lipizzans are gray. Like all gray horses, they have black skin, dark eyes, and as adult horses, a white <b>hair</b> <b>coat.</b> Gray horses, {{including}} Lipizzans, are born darkusually bay or blackand become lighter each {{year as the}} graying process takes place, with the process being complete at between 6 and 10 years of age. Lipizzans are not actually true white horses, {{but this is a}} common misconception. A white horse is born white and has unpigmented skin.|$|E

5000|$|Many famous horses, {{past and}} present, were {{alleged to be}} [...] "white" [...] by observers, but were {{actually}} grays with <b>hair</b> <b>coats</b> turned fully white. Likewise, most white horses used in movies are actually grays, {{in part because they}} are easier to find.|$|R
50|$|The bow is loosely strung with horse <b>hair</b> <b>coated</b> with larch or cedar wood resin, and is {{held from}} {{underneath}} {{with the right}} hand. The underhand grip enables the hand to tighten the loose hair of the bow, allowing very fine control of the instrument's timbre.|$|R
25|$|Deficiency {{symptoms}} in other nonruminant animals include disorders of the nervous, gastrointestinal, and immune systems, reduced growth rate, decreased food intake, skin lesions {{and changes in}} <b>hair</b> <b>coat,</b> and alterations in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism.|$|E
25|$|In the winter, horses grow a heavy <b>hair</b> <b>coat</b> to {{keep warm}} and usually stay warm if well-fed and allowed access to shelter. But if kept artificially clipped for show, or if under stress from age, {{sickness}} or injury, a horse blanket {{may need to be}} added to protect the horse from cold weather. In the summer, access to shade is well-advised.|$|E
25|$|If {{the terrain}} {{does not provide}} natural shelter {{in the form of}} heavy trees or other windbreaks, an {{artificial}} shelter must be provided; a horse's insulating <b>hair</b> <b>coat</b> works less efficiently when wet or when subjected to wind, horses that cannot get away from wind and precipitation put unnecessary energy into maintaining core body warmth and may become susceptible to illness.|$|E

25|$|Ponies {{are often}} {{distinguished}} by their phenotype, a stocky body, dense bone, round shape and well-sprung ribs. They {{have a short}} head, large eyes and small ears.

They have strong hooves and grow a heavier <b>hair</b> <b>coat,</b> seen in a thicker mane and tail {{as well as a}} particularly heavy winter coat.|$|E
25|$|Adults of {{the genus}} Hippobosca are large, robust flies that retain their wings to fly for {{repeated}} blood meals, between hosts such as cattle, camels or horses in a herd. Stout piercing mouthparts project downward from the head (see Hippobosca in Gallery). The abdomen bulges largely, especially when containing a developing larva. The life-cycle is the larviparous type, {{similar to that of}} tsetse-flies, few offspring are produced per female but their survival rate is high. In species that never develop wings as adults, such as Melophagus ovinus, the sheep-ked, the fully developed larvae are deposited by the female on the <b>hair</b> <b>coat</b> of the host. There pupation occurs rapidly followed by complete metamorphosis into an adult (see photograph of Melophagus).|$|E
25|$|Synthetic {{chemicals}} such as diethyltoluamide (often called DEET) {{dissolved in}} an oily carrier are sometimes used. Also {{there are various}} organic, botanical repellents such as citronella oil and neem oil. Typically various types of synthetic pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and permethrin are formulated in an oil or watery suspension suitable for application direct to the skin of animals at risk. This is usually done with a pour-on applicator along the back line of the host from where the insecticide spreads downwards through the <b>hair</b> <b>coat.</b> In addition, to protect against flies such as Stomoxys and Glossina species that feed on legs and belly the insecticide can be sprayed selectively to those regions. Also cattle can be treated using self-applicators such as back-rubbers made of large bundles of fiber impregnated with the insecticide, or in automatic walk-through sprayers. The same types of insecticides are also formulated into the plastic sheet of ear-tags for protecting cattle against Musca and similar flies feeding around the head of cattle. Insect growth regulators (juvenile hormones, chitin synthesis inhibitors, etc.) are available. For example, the insect growth regulator cyromazine is effective for the prevention or treatment of infestations with blowfly larvae. Botanical extracts such as azadirachtin from the neem tree can be formulated as repellents and insecticides, with the potential advantage of more rapid degradation to harmless forms in the environment, lower toxicity and potentially lower cost.|$|E

500|$|Horses {{that have}} a white coat color are often mislabeled; a horse that looks [...] "white" [...] is usually a middle-aged or older gray. Grays are born a darker shade, get lighter as they age, but usually keep black skin {{underneath}} their white <b>hair</b> <b>coat</b> (with the exception of pink skin under white markings). The only horses properly called white are born with a predominantly white <b>hair</b> <b>coat</b> and pink skin, a fairly rare occurrence.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 An {{extensive}} {{review of}} the literature dealing with the role of copper in nutrition has been made; much emphasis has particularly been placed upon some of the "comparative" aspects of copper metabolism in various species. A study of the comparative copper metabolism of three strains of rats and of golden hamsters was made at two levels of dietary copper. For this purpose low-copper basal diets were supplemented with 10 ppm of copper. Growth rates and food intakes {{did not appear to be}} significantly affected over eight week periods. All types of animals used showed impaired tissue copper status on the basal diets. Also affected were hemoglobin values and <b>hair</b> <b>coats.</b> Blood, liver and hair copper values rose to essentially normal levels in response to copper supplementation. Depigmentation of <b>hair</b> <b>coats</b> and alopecia likewise responded to copper supplementation. Hair copper levels appear to furnish a useful index of copper status in the several types of animals used. These results suggest the need for additional studies with other strains available in this laboratory...|$|R

500|$|Galloway cattle are {{naturally}} polled (without horns). The most visible characteristics are its long <b>hair</b> <b>coat</b> and the broad white belt that completely encircles its body. Its coarse outer coat helps shed the rain, and its soft undercoat provides insulation and waterproofing, enabling the breed to spend winter outside. Black Belteds {{are the most}} prominent, but Dun and Red Belteds are also recognised by breed societies, the latter being comparatively rare and sought after. A female Belted Galloway cannot be registered in the Herd Book if it has white above the dewclaw other than the belt, but can be registered in the Appendix.
