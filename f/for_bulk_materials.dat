50|$|ARF is a {{variable}} speed rotary feeder <b>for</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>materials</b> that works {{in harmony with}} the natural flow of the material being fed. The ARF, using a rotating member and articulable gate, controls the volume of material flow based on the material's inherent angle of repose.

Drum rotation allows the material to be gently fed without retarding material flow, while minimizing surge loading, product degradation, dust generation and maintaining uniformity of material flow.|$|E

As distance increases from the air injection point, what was initially a series of plugs gradually turns into a continuous airborne stream. The amount of air required and the appropriate pipe diameter depend on the type and quantity of matter being conveyed.|$|E
