5|$|Catalytic {{variants}} employing stoichiometric diallylcarbonate {{and other}} allylic carbonates {{have also been}} developed, primarily by Jiro Tsuji. For these the choice of solvent is essential: nitrile solvents produce the desired enones while <b>ethereal</b> solvents produce α-allyl ketones instead.|$|E
5|$|Eloe Fanouche of RAM {{focussed}} {{on another}} aspect:Unlike many groups {{they were able}} to capture the <b>ethereal</b> quality of their recorded sound on stage... On being asked how live gigs compared to studio work, they all declared that the straight atmosphere of the studio was too clinical.|$|E
5|$|Shakespear has, {{as it were}} by design, {{drawn off}} from Caliban the {{elements}} of whatever is <b>ethereal</b> and refined, to compound them in the unearthly mould of Ariel. Nothing was ever more finely conceived than this contrast between the material and the spiritual, the gross and delicate.|$|E
5|$|A thirteen-year-old girl, Maria Jackson (Yasmin Paige), and her {{recently}} {{divorced father}} Alan (Joseph Millson) {{move into a}} house opposite journalist and former time-traveller Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen). The night after they have moved in, Maria is woken by an <b>ethereal</b> light emanating from Sarah Jane's house, which she discovers, to her horrified fascination, to be Sarah Jane conversing with a star poet, or arcateenian.|$|E
5|$|In Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams {{the band}} experimented with {{different}} instruments and drew influences from a wider and more varied range of styles. The album mixes experimental instrumentation with elements both symphonic and electronic, {{and the music}} introduces a minimalist approach full of <b>ethereal</b> sonics. The record carries the concept album format of This Is War and expands the spectrum to revolve around the themes after which it is named.|$|E
5|$|My Bloody Valentine are an Irish {{rock band}} formed in Dublin in 1983. Since 1987, the band's lineup has {{consisted}} of founding members Kevin Shields (vocals, guitar) and Colm Ó Cíosóig (drums), with Bilinda Butcher (vocals, guitar) and Debbie Googe (bass). Their work {{is known for}} integrating experimental guitar techniques, <b>ethereal</b> melody, and unorthodox production approaches, resulting in their pioneering a musical style known as shoegazing during the late 1980s and early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Alto's Adventure is a 2015 endless runner snowboarding {{video game}} by Snowman. The player-character {{automatically}} {{moves to the}} right of the screen through procedurally generated landscapes. The player taps the screen to jump and perform tricks, and works towards goals, competitive high scores, and upgrades. Snowman, a Toronto-based, three-person indie development team, previously worked on productivity apps before Alto's Adventure. The game was made to emulate the <b>ethereal</b> atmosphere of snowboarding, and was inspired by Journey (2012), Monument Valley (2014), Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 (2000), and Windosill (2009).|$|E
5|$|Béart {{is given}} an <b>ethereal</b> quality by Lubtchansky's {{cinematography}} and lighting, and she subtly portrays Marie's detachment and vulnerability. In {{the latter part}} of the film Béart is dressed in grey and looks tired and wan, showing Marie's ageing and angst. Béart says she made deliberate use of silence in playing the part. Radziwiłowicz's performance allows the viewer to sympathise with Julien despite the character's initial dislikeable nature. Brochet as Madame X has a cool ease and grace.|$|E
5|$|Chryssides {{states that}} Raëlism is {{discernible}} from other UFO religions for its heavy support for physicalism and repudiation of supernaturalism. Susan J. Palmer, a social scholar {{who had long}} contacts with Raëlians, associated epiphenomenalism with the belief in Raëlism that mind transfer coupled with human cloning can implant mind and personality into a new and disease free body. Raëlians publicly deny {{the existence of the}} <b>ethereal</b> soul and a supernatural god, but they believe that humanity for many generations past will be resurrected, albeit in a scientific way.|$|E
5|$|Indium metal {{does not}} react with water, {{but it is}} {{oxidized}} by stronger oxidizing agents such as halogens to give indium(III) compounds. It does not form a boride, silicide, or carbide, and the hydride InH3 has at best a transitory existence in <b>ethereal</b> solutions at low temperatures, being unstable enough to spontaneously polymerize without coordination. Indium is rather basic in aqueous solution, showing only slight amphoteric characteristics, and unlike its lighter homologs aluminium and gallium, it is insoluble in aqueous alkaline solutions.|$|E
5|$|The Avatar completes {{a series}} of tests at Scintillus Academy, a mage school whose staff was killed by the Guardian. Afterwards, the player travels to the Pits of Carnage, a {{subterranean}} prison on a world where the Guardian trains soldiers to attack other dimensions; and to the Tomb of Praecor Loth, where a king killed in a war with the Guardian is buried. Finally, the Avatar visits the <b>Ethereal</b> Void, a strange world with floating, glowing pathways and no map. Eventually, the Avatar discovers that Mayor Patterson is the traitor and destroys the blackrock dome.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} a prologue {{during the summer of}} 2049 in a snowstorm. In a modern, broken-down grocery store, Nier fends off attacks from <b>ethereal</b> monsters to protect his sick young daughter, Yonah. After {{defeating}} the monsters, he checks on Yonah, who has begun to cough badly. The game then cuts to 1,312 years later, where Nier and Yonah are now living in a village built upon the ruins of an old town. The low-technology village is one of several, and is surrounded by more modern ruins such as the remnants of train tracks and industrial machinery. The areas between towns are filled with monsters known as Shades that attack travelers.|$|E
5|$|Alan Wake (voiced by Matthew Porretta) is {{a best-selling}} {{psychological}} thriller author {{but has been}} suffering from a two-year stretch of writer's block. He and his wife Alice travel to the small mountain town of Bright Falls {{in the state of}} Washington for a short vacation on the advice of Alice and his friend and agent Barry Wheeler. Before arrival, Alan has a nightmare about shadowy figures who tried to harm him before an <b>ethereal</b> figure interrupts his dream and teaches him how to use light to fight the shadows. On their arrival, Alan goes to retrieve the keys and map to their rented cabin from Carl Stucky, the cabin's landlord, but he is visited by a mysterious old woman, who tells him that Stucky had fallen ill and she was entrusted to give Alan the keys. After Alan leaves, Stucky is shown trying to catch up to him and give him the real keys.|$|E
5|$|For most of history, {{humanity}} did {{not recognize}} or {{understand the concept of}} the Solar System. Most people up to the Late Middle Ages–Renaissance believed Earth to be stationary at the centre of the universe and categorically different from the divine or <b>ethereal</b> objects that moved through the sky. Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos, Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a mathematically predictive heliocentric system. In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton developed an understanding of physics that led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that Earth moves around the Sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that governed Earth. The invention of the telescope led to the discovery of further planets and moons. Improvements in the telescope and the use of unmanned spacecraft have enabled the investigation of geological phenomena, such as mountains, craters, seasonal meteorological phenomena, such as clouds, dust storms and ice caps on the other planets.|$|E
5|$|StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty {{introduces}} the fanatical Tal'Darim, {{who are at}} odds with Jim Raynor while he attempts to find Xel'Naga artifacts for the Moebius Foundation. More significantly, Zeratul discovers that some force has successfully combined Protoss and Zerg genetic material, creating a race of incredibly powerful hybrids. Zeratul travels to Aiur to probe the corpse of the Zerg Overmind for information on an apocalyptic prophecy, and unexpectedly finds Tassadar in an <b>ethereal</b> form. Memories found in the Overmind's cortex depict a vision of a future in which Kerrigan is killed, whereupon the hybrids (led by an entity known only as the Dark Voice) take control of the Swarm, destroy all other forms of life, then obliterate the Zerg as well. The Protoss are the last society left standing against the Dark Voice's armies. Zeratul finds Raynor, knowing his intent to track down and defeat the Queen of Blades, and tells him to spare her life.|$|E
5|$|Using ten {{orichalcum}} beads at a {{time would}} enable them to control the water with the powers they gained, keeping the sea level down to prevent an impending catastrophe. Unknowingly, Indiana starts the machine with the stones, upon which Kerner, Ubermann, and the Nazi troops invade the place and announce their intention to use the machine to become gods. The machine was responsible for creating the mutated skeletons seen earlier, but the Nazis believe that it will work on them due to their Aryan qualities. Ubermann wants to use Jones as a test subject, but Kerner steps onto the platform first, claiming himself to be most suitable for godhood. Just as Ubermann wants to start the machine, Jones mentions Plato's tenfold error, which convinces Kerner to use one bead instead of ten. He is then turned into a horribly deformed and horned creature, and falls into the lava. Indiana is forced to step on the platform next but threatens Ubermann with eternal damnation once he is a god. Fearing his wrath, Ubermann uses the machine on himself, feeding it one hundred beads. He is turned into a green <b>ethereal</b> being, but his form becomes unstable and he flies apart with an agonized scream.|$|E
5|$|Velázquez's {{portrait}} is {{a staging}} {{of a private}} moment of intimacy and a dramatic departure from the classical depictions of sleep and intimacy found in works from antiquity and Venetian art that portray Venus. However, the simplicity with which Velázquez displays the female nude—without jewellery {{or any of the}} goddess's usual accessories—was echoed in later nude studies by Ingres, Manet, and Baudry, among others. In addition, Velázquez's depiction of Venus as a reclining nude viewed from the rear was a rarity before that time, although the pose has been painted by many later artists. Manet, in his stark female portrayal Olympia, paraphrased the Rokeby Venus in pose and by suggesting the persona of a real woman rather than an <b>ethereal</b> goddess. Olympia shocked the Parisian art world when it was first exhibited in 1863. Olympia gazes directly out at the viewer, as does Velázquez's Venus, only through the reflection of the mirror.|$|E
5|$|In a {{biological}} symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) {{who were part of}} him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered {{to the ends of the}} earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the <b>ethereal</b> part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E
5|$|Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) {{is a small}} {{oil panel}} by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably {{executed}} between c. 1438–40, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips {{the hem of her}} red dress in a manner that recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch {{at the rear of the}} nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. In a doorway to the right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn book. Like other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to her surroundings. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's virginal purity and God's <b>ethereal</b> presence.|$|E

25|$|LAH is soluble in many <b>ethereal</b> solutions. However, it may spontaneously {{decompose}} due to {{the presence}} of catalytic impurities, though, it appears to be more stable in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Thus, THF is preferred over, e.g., diethyl ether, despite the lower solubility.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} {{completed}} using simple {{devices such as}} table fans to rustle the leaves. A few unexpected things happened for the good while shooting the climax scene. For instance, a rare and unexpected early morning mist {{on the banks of}} Godavari made the whole scene <b>ethereal.</b>|$|E
25|$|One of Draheim's {{hallmarks}} was her eclecticism, and {{the first}} half of the 80s found her recording with a variety of artists including <b>ethereal,</b> new wave pagan/wiccan Gwydion Pendderwen, the more solidly traditional Cajun and country Delta Sisters, and Rory McNamara with his blend of Irish and American music.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, {{she created}} {{a series of}} sculptures protesting stereotypical {{societal}} roles for women, as child bearers, devouring mothers, witches, and prostitutes. Some of her early artworks from this Bride period depicted ghostly, skeletal brides dressed in white, which have been compared to Miss Havisham, an <b>ethereal</b> character in Charles Dickens' novel Great Expectations.|$|E
25|$|Lothlórien: a soft, <b>ethereal</b> chorus {{accompanied}} by cellos in the Phrygian mode. It {{is written in}} an adapted form the Maqam Hijaz, so as {{to create a sense}} of antiquity and provide Lorien with a slightly unsettling effect. A more hard-edged, brass-driven version of the theme appears in the second film during the battle of Helm's Deep.|$|E
25|$|Tuten's {{most recent}} novel, The Green Hour (2002), {{is in many}} ways a {{departure}} from the others. The setting is the present day, and the characters are not borrowed from history. Further, it lacks much of the impertinent humor and <b>ethereal</b> feel of his previous works. The story recounts the 30-year love affair between an academic and a spiritual vagabond.|$|E
25|$|The {{covalent}} {{character of}} the anhydrous material is indicated by its relatively low melting point of 275°C. Further evidence for covalency {{is provided by the}} high solubility of the dichloride in <b>ethereal</b> solvents, where it forms adducts with the formula ZnCl2L2, where L = ligand such as O(C2H5)2. In the gas phase, ZnCl2 molecules are linear with a bond length of 205pm.|$|E

25|$|Sensory overload, the {{opposite}} of sensory deprivation. The subject can for instance be rocked {{for a long time}} in a specially designed cradle, or submitted to light forms of torture, to cause the brain to shut itself off from all sensory input. Both conditions tend to cause confusion and this disorientation often permits the subject to experience vivid, <b>ethereal</b> out-of-body experiences.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{objects are}} portrayed with a disciplined {{graphical}} precision.
