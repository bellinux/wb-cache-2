In the LHC, insulation improvement is a key point in the development of interaction region magnets and injector chain fast-pulsed magnets for luminosity upgrade; the high heat load of these magnets, in fact, is not compatible with the use of current insulation schemes. We review the standard insulation schemes for Nb-Ti and Nb 3 Sn technology from the thermal point of view. We implement, in an analytical model, the strongly nonlinear thermal resistances of the different coil components including the permeability to superfluid helium of Nb-Ti insulations, measured during the LHC main dipole development. We use such a model to compare Nb-Ti and Nb 3 Sn technologies by taking into account their specific operating margin in different working conditions.

40|$|A new {{insulation}} {{scheme for}} the Nb–Ti superconducting magnets to better extract {{heat from the}} coil was proposed in 2007, and several experiments were done to validate this novel concept, including {{the construction of a}} large aperture quadrupole. An essential parameter of this scheme is the size of the microchannels provided by a new topology of the <b>insulation</b> <b>wrapping,</b> allowing a direct helium path from the helium bath to the strands. The main question is whether these channels are still open under the large pressures induced during assembly and by electromagnetic forces. In this paper, one shows that a thermal model of the insulation scheme can be used to interpret the experimental data. The model suggests that the microchannels are significantly reduced with respect to their nominal values but are still well open. To validate this result, a finite-element model of the insulation and strands under pressure is done, and the behavior of this complex topology is estimated. The mechanical model confirms that the microchannels are open even under pressures of 100 MPa, with a cross-sectional reduction on the order of 50 %. A parametric analysis of the microchannel deformation versus pressure is carried out, showing a good agreement with the experiments...|$|R

40|$|Today, {{with the}} rapid {{depletion}} of fossil energy sources and the increasing environmental problems caused by fossil fuels, supervision and management of energy consumption becomes more important. Looking at the breakdown of energy consumption by sectors, the buildings sector is seen {{as one of the}} priority areas for energy efficiency after industry and transportation. 80 % of the total energy used from the production of a building till its demolition is consumed during utilization of the building. Therefore, priority is given to applications that reduce the amount of energy consumed during the utilization phase throughout the lifetimes of buildings. There are several ecological retrofitting done so as {{to reduce the amount of}} energy consumed during utilization in buildings that have not yet completed their lifetimes. In Turkey, energy consumption is increasing every year, mostly in the industry and building sector; a large portion of the energy used in residential buildings is consumed for heating and cooling purposes. Most effective energy saving in residential buildings can be achieved by using heat insulation, an easy-to-use energy efficiency technology. In the recent years, insulation jacketing on the external walls of existing buildings has become very common in Turkey, and the energy saving gained from this practice is the subject of this paper. In line with the purpose of the study, the energy gain from various insulation alternatives on the external walls and roof of a residential building selected for this study will be evaluated. In the external insulation system, the <b>insulation</b> <b>wraps</b> the building like a jacket, without creating a heat bridge. Although the cost of external insulation system is higher compared to other systems, it is the most suitable system for buildings built for long- time use, such as residential buildings, that is why it is preferred to insulate the outer surfaces of the walls in such buildings. It was considered that the insulation materials and insulation thicknesses would differ for each of the various insulation alternatives applied on the outer surfaces of walls. Annual energy costs of various alternative insulation applications were calculated and evaluated against the energy saving occurring in a non-insulated building. The study will help investors and users in assessing in economic terms the various options for insulation before engaging in any ecological retrofitting works on existing buildings, and in selecting the right insulation application. For the national economy, the study will provide the energy saving gained from various retrofitting applications...|$|R

Current cryogen feed line multilayer insulation (MLI) performance is 10 times worse per area than tank MLI insulation. During each launch, cryogenic piping loses approximately 150, 000 gallons (equivalent to $ 300, 000) in boil-off during transfer, chill down, and ground hold.

This textile is used because of its sturdy yet flexible origin, which can carry weight yet, still be lightweight and compactable. Fisherman use netting when trawling, because it is sturdy enough to carry large amounts of weight as fish are trapped, pulled, then lifted out of water. Oftentimes, the filaments that make up the yarn are coated with wax or plastic. This coating adds a waterproof component to the textile that provides even more reliability. Net is also used in medical practices to provide fabric <b>insulation</b> and <b>wrapping</b> under an industry standard sling. In the medical practice, netting provides cushion and protection, when used in layers, but still allows the skin to breathe under the fabric.

Filaments can be made from synthetic or natural fibres, but that is all up to the manufacturer when deciphering what the textiles future entails. When netting is going to be exposed to water or heat often, manufacturers consider that and apply what best fits that textile.|$|R

40|$|Noise {{radiated}} {{from high}} speed centrifugal compressors {{is becoming a}} significant design factor. The dominant noise components of a centrifugal compressor can be identified at its blade passing frequencies (BPFs), of which each is a strong tonal noise. Popular noise control methods of a centrifugal compressor includes building of sound <b>insulation</b> enclosure, <b>wrapping</b> of noise <b>insulation</b> materials, mounting of vibration absorbers, and etc. These noise control methods are more effective for broadband noise reduction. Thus, they are generally ineffective to reduce a tonal noise such as the BPF components of the centrifugal compressor. In this thesis, a quarter-wavelength resonator array installed at the outlet pipe of a single-stage centrifugal compressor is studied, which is aimed to reduce the tonal noise of the compressor. In order to optimally design the quarter-wavelength resonators, numerical simulations are performed by using a commercial software package, COMSOL Multiphysics ? Acoustics Module. The optimization procedure is to optimally select geometric design parameters of the quarter-wavelength resonator array such as the diameter and depth of each resonator, and the spacing between the resonators in the axial and circumferential directions. The next procedure is to investigate the effect of four different configurations (i. e., staggered and slanted resonators and the resonators mounted on an expansion pipe and a curved pipe) on the noise reduction performance. Then, the analyses of flow effects on the noise reduction performance of the resonator array are conducted both numerically and experimentally. The high speed air flow induced by the compressor results in wavenumber shifts of noise waves, thus influencing the tonal noise reduction performance of the resonator array. The numerical flow effect analyses are conducted by using commercial software packages, ANSYS FLUENT and ACTRAN. In particular, these software package are used to conduct hybrid aeroacoustic simulations, in which fluid flow and aeroacoustic noise analyses are conducted separately, based on {{the theory of the}} Lighthill?s aeroacoustic analogy. The numerical and experimental results show that the optimally designed quarter-wavelength resonator array can be used to achieve nearly 10 dB noise reduction. From these results, it is also shown that a relation between the Mach number of the airflow and the maximum performance frequency shift is represented as a quadratic curve of ?f = 1918 M^(2) - 24. 21 M where M is the Mach number and ?f is the frequency shift...|$|R
40|$|Recent contradicting {{evidence}} on the contributions of xylem and phloem to tomato fruit growth highlights {{the need for a}} more thorough insight into the dynamics of sap flow through the tomato peduncle. In fact, knowledge on sap flow dynamics through small plant parts remains scarce, {{due to a lack of}} direct measurements. Most currently available sap flow sensors use needles, making them inappropriate for the direct measurement of sap flow through small plant parts such as a tomato peduncle. Therefore, a non-invasive sap flow sensor based on the heat field deformation (HFD) principle was tested on the peduncle of a tomato truss. This mini HFD sensor, consisting of a heater element and three thermocouples stitched on <b>insulation</b> tape, was <b>wrapped</b> around the peduncle and allowed continuous monitoring of changes in the heat field around the heater caused by sap flow. Actual influx into the tomato truss was calculated based on fruit growth data and estimates of fruit transpiration and was compared with the dynamics measured with the mini HFD sensor. Additionally, heat girdling of the peduncle was performed to block phloem influx to study the dynamics of xylem and phloem influx using the mini HFD sensor. First results of the mini HFD sensor were promising and the measured sap flow dynamics through the tomato peduncle agreed well with the calculated sap influx. Results of the girdling experiment suggested opposite patterns of xylem and phloem influx, with a decreased xylem influx during the daytime. Furthermore, the pattern of xylem influx revealed a close relation with the total water potential in the stem. As such, the mini HFD sensor provided direct measurements of sap flow dynamics through a tomato peduncle and, hence, has a large potential to finally resolve the controversy on water influx into developing fruits...|$|R

The cylindrical rock, called a core, can be cut from the reservoir during a separate core drilling operation or a formation outcrop. A core flooding apparatus suitable for matrix acidizing was designed and assembled. Matrix acidizing is a stimulation technique in which hydrochloric acid (HCl) is injected down the wellbore below formation fracture pressure to dissolve carbonate (CaCO 3) rock creating high permeability streaks called wormholes. The main components of the apparatus include a continuous flow syringe pump, three core holders, a hydraulic hand pump, two accumulators, a back pressure regulator, and two pressure transducers connected {{through a series of}} tubing and valves. Due to the corrosive nature of the acid, the apparatus features Hastelloy which is a corrosion resistant metal alloy. Another substantial feature of the apparatus is the ability to apply 3000 psi back pressure. This is the pressure necessary to keep CO 2, a product of the CaCO 3 and HCl reaction, in solution at elevated temperatures. To perform experiments at temperature, the core holder is wrapped with heating tape and surrounded by <b>insulation.</b> Tubing is <b>wrapped</b> around a heating band with insulation to heat the fluid before it enters the core. A LabVIEW graphical programming code was written to control heaters as well as record temperature and pressure drop across the core. Other considerations for the design include minimizing footprint, operational ease by the user, vertical placement of the accumulators and core holders to minimize gravity effects, and air release valves. Core floods can be performed at varying injection rates, temperatures and pressures up to 5000 psi and 250 degF. The apparatus can handle small core plugs, 1 ?? diameter X 1 ?? length, up to 4 ??

The imminent dismission of the Space Shuttle Programme, the economic crisis, the presence of emerging countries interested in the space exploitation, have changed the approach to the space development. Today’s approach is towards an efficiency increasing of the already known technologies, instead to the development of new and more challenging technologies. In this frame, the European Space Agency (ESA) is aiming to improving its launching capability; the strategy is focused both on technology amelioration, both {{in the creation of a}} more versatile launcher fleet. The activity performed in this master’s degree thesis, in collaboration with TAS-I engineers, concerns on the improving of the cryogenic propulsion. Starting from a State of The Art (SoTA) review on launchers and engines, the study deal with a preliminary geometry study, equipped by analyses and sizing, of an LH 2 /LOX tank. The designed cryogenic tank has been assumed as basis to a deeper study on the main thesis object: the design and analysis of a Thermal Shield for Cryogenic Tank. The various phases of launcher mission, in general, could be summarized in three main phases: On-Ground, Ascent and Cruise phases; in all three main phases it is very important to reduce the thermal gap between tank and external environment, to reduce degrading processes like the propellant boil-off. For each phase have been identified the optimum countermeasures, based on the relative thermal transmission mechanism: • On-Ground the predominant effect is the convection • During the Ascent the atmospheric drug is the main thermal source • During Cruising phase the thermal exchange is due to radiation. ESA aims is to develop a system capable of ensuring thermal insulation on all the three phases, capable to be easily adapted to ESA next generation launcher, with a small total launcher mass increasing.
