5|$|The game {{features}} online multiplayer. Having five maps as standard, matches can {{be carried}} out with select players, random players, or through local multiplayer. Random battles are played either with standard rules, or with special limitations. The Fog of War <b>environmental</b> <b>effect</b> is removed, and turns have limits of five minutes. In addition, Fates features Amiibo support, with compatible figurines being characters from earlier Fire Emblem games: when scanned, the character represented by a figurine will appear within My Castle, and after talking with them three times they can be fought in battle. When defeated, they become allies that join the main campaign. Talking with them prior to the fight gives the Avatar themed items, such as the mask of Fire Emblem Awakenings Lucina. Amiibo functions are unlocked after the narrative splits and My Castle is unlocked.|$|E

This paper proposes a method to apply ontology approach in product design. During product reliability design and analysis, <b>environmental</b> <b>effects</b> knowledge reusing is achieved. First, the relationship of <b>environmental</b> <b>effects</b> and product reliability is analyzed. Then <b>environmental</b> <b>effects</b> ontology to describe <b>environmental</b> <b>effects</b> domain knowledge is designed. Related concepts of <b>environmental</b> <b>effects</b> are formally defined by using the ontology approach.

Finally, rubber seals used in the subhumid acid rain environment are taken as an example to illustrate ontological model application on reliability design and analysis...|$|R

Researchers have long measured that breast cancer rates in an immigrant population soon come to resemble the rates of the host country after a few generations. The {{reason for this is}} speculated to be immigrant uptake of the host country diet. The prototypical example of this phenomenon is the changing rate of breast cancer after the arrival of Japanese immigrants to America.|$|E

2500|$|After these {{products}} are properly disposed, the process of treating them for minimizing <b>environmental</b> <b>effect</b> begins. Water treatment facilities use different processes {{in order to minimize}} or fully eliminate the amount of these pollutants. This is done by using sorption where suspended solids are removed by sedimentation. [...] Another method used is biodegradation, and through this method microorganisms, such as bacteria, feed or break down these pollutants thus eliminating them from the contaminated media.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>environmental</b> <b>effect</b> of {{pharmaceuticals}} {{and personal}} care products (PPCPs) is largely speculative. PPCPs are substances used by individuals for personal health or cosmetic reasons and the products used by agribusiness to boost growth or health of livestock. [...] PPCPs have been detected in water bodies throughout the world. [...] The effects of these chemicals on humans and the environment are not yet known, but to date {{there is no scientific}} evidence that they affect human health. The term PPCPs contains as well environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants (EPPPs). The European Union summarizes pharmaceutical residues with the potential of contamination of water and soil together with other micropollutants under [...] "priority substances".|$|E

2500|$|To {{create a}} navigable channel through the Long Sault rapids {{and to allow}} {{hydroelectric}} stations to be established immediately upriver from Cornwall, Ontario and Massena, New York, Lake St. Lawrence was created behind a dam. It required the condemnation and acquisition {{by the government of}} all the properties of six villages and three hamlets in Ontario; these are now collectively known as [...] "The Lost Villages". The area was flooded on July 1, 1958, creating the lake. There was also inundation on the New York side of the border and the village of Louisville Landing was submerged. A notable adverse <b>environmental</b> <b>effect</b> of the operation of the Seaway has been the introduction of numerous invasive species of aquatic animals into the Great Lakes Basin. The zebra mussel has been most damaging in the Great Lakes and through its invasion of related rivers, waterways and city water facilities.|$|E
2500|$|The {{case was}} remanded to the District Court. The ICC had {{effectively}} incorporated the 2.5 percent surcharge {{into a larger}} rate increase, including on recyclable materials. The ICC also prepared a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the economic and <b>environmental</b> <b>effect</b> of the rate increase. On remand, the District Court found the EIS inadequate and issued a preliminary injunction. Chief Justice Burger stayed the order. The full Court declined to vacate the order, vacated the preliminary injunction' and remanded the case for reconsideration. The District Court, on reconsideration, concluded the EIS was inadequate and directed the ICC to prepare another one and reconsider its decision. The Supreme Court (per Justice White) reversed the District Court in Aberdeen & Rockfish R. Co. v. SCRAP, [...] Justice Douglas dissented. He would have affirmed the District court decision {{in large part because}} of the inadequacy of the EIS and the need to consider NEPA more than [...] "a technical statute of administrative procedure."
