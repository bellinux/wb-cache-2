2500|$|Wireless {{keyboards}} {{have become}} popular for their increased user freedom. A wireless keyboard often includes a required combination {{transmitter and receiver}} unit that attaches to the computer's <b>keyboard</b> <b>port.</b> The wireless aspect is achieved either by radio frequency (RF) or by infrared (IR) signals sent and received from both the keyboard and the unit attached to the computer. A wireless keyboard may use an industry standard RF, called Bluetooth. With Bluetooth, the transceiver may be built into the computer. However, a wireless keyboard needs batteries to work and may pose a security problem due {{to the risk of}} data [...] "eavesdropping" [...] by hackers. Wireless solar keyboards charge their batteries from small solar panels using sunlight or standard artificial lighting. An early example of a consumer wireless keyboard is that of the Olivetti Envision.|$|E

50|$|PS/2 {{mouse and}} {{keyboard}} connectors {{have also been}} used in non-IBM PC-compatible computer systems, such as the DEC AlphaStation line, early IBM RS/6000 CHRP machines and SGI Indy, Indigo 2, and newer (Octane, etc.) computers. Various Macintosh clone computers from the late 1990s featured PS/2 mouse and <b>keyboard</b> <b>ports,</b> including the Motorola StarMax and the Power Computing PowerBase.|$|R

50|$|PCI and ISA {{models are}} available. The PC Weasel is also {{connected}} to a PS/2-compatible <b>keyboard</b> <b>port</b> and effectively emulates a keyboard by converting characters obtained from the serial port to keyboard scancodes.The card may also {{be connected to the}} reset pins of the motherboard and reboot the machine on command.|$|E

50|$|During {{development}} of the AppleBus system, computer networking became a vitally important feature of any computer system. With no card slots, the Macintosh was unable to easily add support for Ethernet or similar local area networking standards. Work on AppleBus was re-directed to networking purposes, and was released in 1985 as the AppleTalk system. This left the Mac with the original single-purpose mouse and <b>keyboard</b> <b>ports,</b> and no general purpose system for low-speed devices to use.|$|R
5000|$|The eMate 300 {{featured}} a 6.8" [...] 480x320 resolution 16-shade grayscale display with a backlight, stylus pen, <b>keyboard,</b> infrared <b>port,</b> and standard Macintosh serial/LocalTalk ports.|$|R
5000|$|Later {{barcode readers}} {{began to use}} USB {{connectors}} rather than the <b>keyboard</b> <b>port,</b> as this became a more convenient hardware option. To retain the easy integration with existing programs, a device driver called a [...] "software wedge" [...] could be used, to emulate the keyboard-impersonating behavior of the old [...] "keyboard wedge" [...] hardware.|$|E
50|$|Early IBM PCs had {{a little-known}} routine in the POST that {{would attempt to}} {{download}} a maintenance program into RAM through the <b>keyboard</b> <b>port</b> before performing any {{other elements of the}} boot process, such as before scanning for option ROMs or executing a boot loader. (No serial or parallel ports were standard on early IBM PCs, but a <b>keyboard</b> <b>port</b> of either the XT or AT / PS/2 type has been standard on practically every PC and clone.) If the download was apparently successful, the BIOS would verify a checksum on it and then run it. This feature was intended for factory test or diagnostic purposes; while it was of limited utility outside of factory or repair facilities, it could be used in a proprietary way to boot the PC as a satellite system to a host machine (as it was used in the manufacturing environment).|$|E
5000|$|A {{wireless}} keyboard can be connected using RF technology {{with the help}} of two parts, a transmitter and a receiver. The radio transmitter is inside the {{wireless keyboard}}. The radio receiver plugs into a <b>keyboard</b> <b>port</b> or USB port. Once the receiver and transmitter are plugged in, the computer recognizes the keyboard and mouse as if they were connected via a cable.|$|E
50|$|The Motorola StarMax {{was a line}} of Macintosh clones {{produced}} by Motorola in 1996 and 1997. They used versions of Apple's Tanzania motherboard, {{which was designed to}} use standard IBM PC compatible components in addition to Apple-proprietary components then in common use in the Power Macintosh family. StarMax computers featured SVGA video ports rather than the proprietary port Apple used at the time, and PS/2 mouse and <b>keyboard</b> <b>ports</b> in addition to ADB. The motherboard was also capable of using manual-eject floppy drives, though Motorola disabled this functionality and shipped the computers with software-eject drives.|$|R
50|$|The Compaq Presario 2200 {{can connect}} to the Internet via dial-up using a {{standard}} 33.6K modem, which can be upgraded to a 56K modem or possibly an Ethernet card. From left to right, the ports are the line-in and phone-in modem jacks, headphone jack, microphone jack, game port, VGA port, a small metal cover, PS/2 mouse and <b>keyboard</b> <b>ports,</b> parallel port, serial port, a C13 power cord socket and a power switch. The small metal cover is where Compaq might have considered USB support early in the computer's development, but the motherboard does not reveal any USB connection pins, so this computer most likely cannot be upgraded to use USB. The later Compaq Presario 4220 had 2 USB ports, which are located on the same metal cover as the 2200.|$|R
50|$|The <b>keyboard</b> <b>ports</b> {{are located}} at address DF00 (hex), or 57088 (decimal). BASIC {{programs}} typically poll for real-time keyboard input {{by using the}} PEEK and POKE commands at that address. Because the keyboard lacks any way to generate an interrupt, {{it is not possible}} to implement a typeahead buffer. The keyboard matrix also lacks any diodes at the intersections of the matrix. This leads to problems when reading certain combinations of keys pressed simultaneously. The matrix was designed to allow only the shift, control and shift-lock keys to be pressed simultaneously with another key. The keyswitches themselves were originally manufactured by Cherry.|$|R
5000|$|The CueCat {{connected}} to computers using the PS/2 <b>keyboard</b> <b>port</b> and USB, and communicated to desktop [...] "CRQ" [...] {{software running on}} Windows 32-bit and Mac OS 9 operating systems. Users of this software were required to register with their ZIP code, gender, and email address. This registration process enabled the device to deliver relevant content to a single or multiple users in a household.|$|E
50|$|Computer {{ports in}} common use cover {{a wide variety}} of shapes such as round (PS/2, etc.), {{rectangular}} (FireWire, etc.), square (Telephone plug), trapezoidal (D-Sub â€” the old printer port was a DB-25), etc. There is some standardization to physical properties and function. For instance, most computers have a <b>keyboard</b> <b>port</b> (currently a Universal Serial Bus USB-like outlet referred to as USB Port), into which the keyboard is connected.|$|E
50|$|Tandy 1000, SX, TX used a {{proprietary}} 8-pin round Din connector for the <b>keyboard</b> <b>port</b> that was {{compatible with the}} older TRS computers but not compatible with the IBM PC/AT or PS/2 standard. The SL/TL series were more compatible with IBM PS/2 keyboard and mouse standard.There are some scanline codes that differed between the Tandy 1000 and IBM PC/XT and at that can result in compatibility issues. Northgate offered a Tandy 1000 compatible keyboard.|$|E

50|$|Original PS/2 {{connectors}} {{were black}} or {{had the same}} color as the connecting cable (mainly white). Later the PC 97 standard introduced a color code: the <b>keyboard</b> <b>port,</b> and the plugs on compliant keyboards, were purple; mouse ports and plugs were green. (Some vendors initially used a different color code; Logitech used the color orange for the keyboard connector for a short period, but soon switched to purple.) Today this code is still used on most PCs. The pinouts of the connectors are the same, but most computers will not recognize devices connected to the wrong port.|$|E

50|$|Tandy 1000 used a {{proprietary}} 6-pin female round connector for the joystick port {{that on the}} SX/TX was adjacent to the <b>keyboard</b> <b>port</b> {{in the front of}} the computer. As with the keyboard, it was compatible with the older TRS-80 and Tandy color computer models. It was not compatible with the IBM standard 15-pin male game port and required a Tandy 1000 compatible joystick. Some PC-DOS games would not work with it, but most games made to work with Tandy 1000 graphics and sound do work. The Tandy 1000 mouse also fit in the game port. The Tandy 1000 mouse is not compatible with 9-pin serial or PS/2 mouse port, and some DOS software will not work with it, though Tandy 1000 specific software like deskmate does work.|$|E
50|$|The VT1000 and VT1200 was {{packaged}} in a pizza box {{case with the}} monitor normally sitting on top and an LK400 series keyboard connected to it using a coiled cord and 4-pin modular connector. The three-button mouse was roughly puck-shaped, not unlike the original iMac mouse, and used a custom 7-pin round connector. The back panel included a coax connector for the monitor, mouse and <b>keyboard</b> <b>ports,</b> a Modified Modular Jack (MMJ) serial port for a printer, another MMJ serial port for host connections, and a thinwire Ethernet connector. It also included AC in and out connectors, the latter used to connect the monitor, allowing it to be turned on and off with the terminal using a single switch located {{on the side of}} the case beside the power connectors. The system supported a number of monochrome monitors, selected using a rotary switch beside the monitor port.|$|R
50|$|The HP 200LX Palmtop PC (F1060A, F1061A, F1216A), {{also known}} as project Felix, is a {{personal}} digital assistant introduced by Hewlett-Packard in August 1994. It was often called a Palmtop PC, and it was notable that it was, with some minor exceptions, a MS-DOS-compatible computer in a palmtop format, complete with a monochrome graphic display, QWERTY <b>keyboard,</b> serial <b>port,</b> and PCMCIA expansion slot.|$|R
5000|$|Mini-DIN-6 {{connectors}} {{were used}} for IBM PC compatible PS/2 <b>keyboard</b> and mouse <b>ports</b> and for Acorn Archimedes keyboards (prior to the A7000 were proprietary, A7000 and later were standardised PS/2).|$|R
50|$|The {{computer}} {{consists of}} a monitor which is the main computer and a keyboard. The computer {{was used as a}} computer terminal so there are no internal drives or daughter cards. The only computer component in the case is a motherboard with a modem port, <b>keyboard</b> <b>port,</b> and an aux. port. Termcap provides support for the Visual 50 by way of the entries named v50, vi50, v50am, or visual50, depending on the system. The computer uses on an SGS (now STMicroelectronics) Z8400AB1 CPU, based on the Zilog Z80A CPU. This CPU has an 8 bit data bus and a 16 bit address bus, and runs at 4 MHz. The keyboard is a Keytronic A65-0248, attached by a 4 wire telephone cord. The keyboard uses an Intel P8048H MCU, a common MCU for keyboards.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Tandy 1000 {{was a large}} computer {{almost the}} size of the IBM PC, though with a plastic case over an aluminium lower chassis to reduce weight. The original Tandy 1000 featured a proprietary <b>keyboard</b> <b>port</b> (using an 8-pin DIN connector) along with 2 joystick ports (using 6-pin DIN connectors) {{on the front of the}} case. Unlike the IBM PCs, the T1K had a red hardware reset button located on the front panel directly beside the keyboard connector. (The user could also use the traditional CTRL-ALT-DEL to reset the machine). The rear featured an RGB monitor connector (a standard 9-pin female D-shell compatible with CGA/EGA monitors), an RCA-style composite video-out connector, a single RCA-style monophonic line-level audio connector, a light pen port, and an card-edge connector used to attach a parallel printer. The printer port followed the old Centronics standard and was not fully compatible with the parallel port found on PCs.|$|E
50|$|HelenOS {{supports}} PATA, SATA, USB mass storage, USB HID, an Atheros USB WiFi dongle, several Ethernet network cards, SoundBlaster 16 and Intel HDA audio devices, serial <b>ports,</b> <b>keyboards,</b> {{mice and}} framebuffers.|$|R
5000|$|Further {{integration}} enabled {{development of}} Super I/O chips [...] - [...] single chips that could control {{a variety of}} devices such as floppy disks, parallel <b>ports,</b> serial <b>ports,</b> <b>keyboard,</b> and mouse.|$|R
