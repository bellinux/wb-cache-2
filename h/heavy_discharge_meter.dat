40|$|Small engine carburetors {{have been}} used for over 100 years and their continual {{development}} has produced a mechanical device that although simple in principle is difficult to control in practice. This study aims to develop a mathematical model of the air and fuel delivery process that occurs in the idle path that can predict the air-to-fuel ratio in small engines. A one-dimensional model was created that incorporates single phase air and fuel flow effects using an electrical circuit analog. The model incorporates dynamic fuel flow effects due to inertia, and was coupled to the engine airflow via input data provided by commercial engine simulation software. The methodology developed for the idle path creates a foundation on which to build a transition system and the boundary conditions that control it. A simplified model of the main path circuit was also created that incorporates single phase inertial effects and was used to provide boundary conditions to the idle path model. Finally, a dynamic sensitivity analysis of the idle path was conducted to analyze which elements of the idle path control the fuel flow response. The second part of this study addressed the results of the sensitivity analysis. The idle <b>discharge</b> <b>metering</b> orifice has the largest effect on the air-to-fuel ratio delivered to the engine by the idle path. An experiment was created to characterize two-phase orifices representative of the idle <b>discharge</b> <b>metering</b> orifice. The data produces an empirical correlation {{that can be used to}} predict the pressure loss across the metering orifice. The correlation displays results that are inconsistent with the homogeneous assumption and highlights the need for further research in this area...|$|R

Here I found a delightful old man, who came a little way with me in the rain to put me safely on the road for Cheylard.

40|$|Candida parapsilosis was {{isolated}} from the vaginas of several nonpregnant, nondiabetic, mostly premenopausal outpatients who presented the characteristic {{signs and symptoms of}} a frank vulvovaginal candidiasis (<b>heavy</b> <b>discharge</b> with cottage cheese appearance and intense itching, with or without vulvar erythema and dyspareunia). All isolates conformed morphologically, biochemically, and serologically to the standard description of the species. They showed high acid proteinase-secretory activity in vitro and were appreciably pathogenic for cyclophosphamide-immunodepressed mice. Some isolates were also tested for their vaginopathic potential in ovariectomized rats under estradiol administration. In all cases, the rat vagina was colonized by C. parapsilosis to an extent and duration not different from those caused by a vaginopathic isolate of Candida albicans. Periodic acid-Schiff-stained vaginal smears taken at intervals during rat experimental infection showed C. parapsilosis yeasts adhering to exfoliated epithelial cells of rat vagina. Overall, these results emphasize the proteolytic and pathogenic potential of C. parapsilosis and suggest that this fungus may be an agent of clinical vaginitis...|$|R

The new arrivals, however, were not yet inured to fighting, and as the French batteries opened upon them, and the soldiers, leaping on to the parapets, poured volley after volley into their midst, they faltered, and presently turned and fled back to the gate, their retreat being protected by <b>heavy</b> <b>discharges</b> of grape from the 68-pounders in the port. The sortie, however, had its effect. The French had suffered heavily from the flanking fire {{as soon as they}} had shown themselves on the parapet, and the assaulting column, knowing from the din of battle that a serious sortie had been made, fell back from the breach, their retreat being hastened by the discharge of a number of hand-grenades by a midshipman of the Theseus {{on the top of the}} tower.|$|R
30|$|This {{procedure}} is unfortunately not without complications [37]. The acute degenerative procedure {{can be very}} painful and infection can occur. Hysterectomy may again be required {{in the case of}} hemorrhage or severe tissue necrosis. Delivering fibroids or sections of fibroids may be a natural process after uterine artery embolisation, therefore it is essential to warn women about the possible risk of infectious symptoms such as <b>heavy</b> <b>discharge</b> and fever, and consequently close follow-up is essential. The spontaneous expulsion of fibroids occurs over several months resulting in a significant reduction in menstrual loss and dysmenorrhea. Adequate antibiotic cover may be necessary to prevent sepsis [38]. A long-term side effect could be premature ovarian failure secondary to interference with the ovarian blood supply. In most studies, ovarian failure after UAE was found to occur most often in women in their late 40 s, with an overall incidence of 5 % [34]. Although UAE is recognised for the treatment of fibroids and associated infertility, it is currently controversial which treatment modality has the greatest efficacy with regard to post-treatment pregnancy rates and also lowest side-effect profile.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of efforts to control water {{resources}} in Florida and projects to drain the Everglades during the early and mid-20th century, water flow into Biscayne Bay has been altered by the construction of canals. These canals channel water from portions of the southeastern Everglades now used for agriculture into the bay. Prior to canal construction, most fresh water inflow came from rain and groundwater, but the canals are now altering the salinity profile of the bay, conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne aquifer. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was established in 2000 to mitigate the effects of human intervention into the natural water flow of the Everglades. Primarily aimed at the restoration of historical patterns of water flow into Everglades National Park, the project will also deal with issues arising from the diversion of {{water out of the}} southern Everglades into Biscayne Bay. The Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project (BBCW) is a CERP component specifically intended to redistribute water flow so that fresh water is introduced gradually through creeks and marshes rather than short, <b>heavy</b> <b>discharges</b> through drainage canals.|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{effluent}} containing <b>heavy</b> metals <b>discharged</b> into streams {{may pose}} high toxicity risks to aquatic organisms and to human health. Therefore, {{it is important}} to understand how to change the amount of effluent with <b>heavy</b> metals <b>discharged</b> from industries into open aquatic ecosystems both for effective management of heavy metals and to foster sustainable ecosystems. This study was conducted to characterize the release of heavy metals from industries based on the Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers database in Korea from 1999 to 2010. From the database, we selected nine heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Mn, Sb, Cu, Zn, Cr, Sn, and Ni) and compared the differences in their effluent for different types of industries. The heavy metal effluents released into freshwater ecosystems were classified into four clusters through the learning process of the self-organizing map. Cluster 1 was characterized by the relatively higher effluent volumes of heavy metals, whereas cluster 4 had lower effluent volumes. The different patterns of the effluent volumes in heavy metals were closely associated with the differences of industrial types, and the changes of effluents of heavy metals reflected the changes in regulations and laws for aquatic ecosystem management...|$|R

40|$|Macroalgal blooms have {{increased}} globally {{in recent decades}} {{as a result of}} increased nutrient enrichment and eutrophication of coastal waters. In Lee County, FL, this problem reached a critical stage in 2003 and 2004 when massive drift rhodophyte blooms washed ashore between Sanibel Island and Bonita Springs, making beaches unsuitable for recreation and requiring an expensive removal program. To better understand the ecology of these blooms, water quality and macroalgae sampling was conducted in early August 2004 prior to hurricane Charley and again in late October following several months of <b>heavy</b> <b>discharges</b> from the Caloosahatchee River. During both samplings, water and macroalgae were collected along a gradient extending from the Caloosahatchee River to natural and artificial reefs some 26 km from shore. Concentrations of dissolved nutrient pools (DIN = NH 4 + + NO 3 − + NO 2 −, TDN, TDP) were generally high throughout the study area with significantly enriched (~ 10 -fold) concentrations in the Caloosahatchee River. The mean DIN concentrations increased from the Ortona Lock (< 18 µM) to the Franklin Lock (23 - 28 µM) in the Caloosahatchee River during both samplings, indicating significant enrichment within the basin.
