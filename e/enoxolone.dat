25|$|Its major dose-limiting toxicities are {{corticosteroid}} in nature, {{because of}} the inhibitory effect that its chief active constituents, glycyrrhizin and <b>enoxolone,</b> have on cortisol degradation, and include oedema, hypokalaemia, weight gain or loss, and hypertension.|$|E
50|$|Glycyrrhizin (or {{glycyrrhizic acid}} or glycyrrhizinic acid) {{is the chief}} sweet-tasting {{constituent}} of Glycyrrhiza glabra (liquorice) root. Structurally it is a saponin and {{has been used as}} an emulsifier and gel-forming agent in foodstuff and cosmetics. Its aglycone is <b>enoxolone</b> and it has therefore been used as a prodrug for that compound, for example it is used in Japan to prevent liver carcinogenesis in patients with chronic hepatitis C.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Enoxolone</b> (INN, BAN; {{also known}} as glycyrrhetinic acid or glycyrrhetic acid) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid {{derivative}} of the beta-amyrin type obtained from the hydrolysis of glycyrrhizic acid, which {{was obtained from the}} herb liquorice. It is used in flavoring and it masks the bitter taste of drugs like aloe and quinine. It is effective in the treatment of peptic ulcer and also has expectorant (antitussive) properties. [...] It has some additional pharmacological properties including antiviral, antifungal, antiprotozoal, and antibacterial activities.|$|E
50|$|Cortisol, a {{glucocorticoid}}, binds the glucocorticoid receptor. However, {{because of}} its molecular similarity to aldosterone it is also capable of binding the mineralcorticoid receptor. Both aldosterone and cortisol have a similar affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor; however, there is vastly more cortisol in circulation than aldosterone. To prevent over-stimulation of the mineralocorticoid receptor by cortisol, HSD-11β converts the biologically active cortisol to the inactive cortisone, which can no longer bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor. 11β-HSD co-localizes with intracellular adrenal steroid receptors. Licorice, which contains glycyrrhetinic acid, or <b>enoxolone</b> can inhibit 11β-HSD and lead to a mineralocorticoid excess syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|... 11α-Hydroxyprogesterone (11α-OHP), or 11α-hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione is an {{endogenous}} steroid and metabolite of progesterone. It is a weak antiandrogen, and is {{devoid of}} androgenic, estrogenic, and progestogenic activity. It was investigated as a topical antiandrogen {{for the treatment}} of androgen-dependent skin conditions in the early 1950s, and was found to produce some benefit. In 1995, 11α-OHP, along with its epimer 11β-hydroxyprogesterone, was identified as a very potent competitive inhibitor of both isoforms (1 and 2) of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD). It is notably not metabolized by 11β-HSD2. 11α-OHP is a more potent inhibitor of 11β-HSD than <b>enoxolone</b> (glycyrrhetinic acid) or carbenoxolone in vitro (IC50 = 0.9 nM; IC50 = 5 nM in transfected cells). The compound {{has been found to be}} highly active in conferring mineralocorticoid sodium-retaining activity of corticosterone in vivo in rat bioassays and in increasing blood pressure, effects that it mediates by preventing the 11β-HSD-mediated inactivation of endogenous corticosteroids. Because of its inhibition of 11β-HSD and consequent potentiation of corticosteroids, 11α-OHP has recently been patented {{for the treatment of}} skin diseases, particularly psoriasis in combination with clobetasol propionate and minoxidil.|$|E
