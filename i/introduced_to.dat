Then, only asserts that the focused denotation (i.e., <b>introducing</b> Bill <b>to</b> Sue) can be composed with the subject (i.e., John), but not the alternative properties (i.e., <b>introducing</b> Bill <b>to</b> Jane, <b>introducing</b> Bill <b>to</b> Mary). Accordingly, 26 b indicates that John <b>introduced</b> Bill <b>to</b> Sue, but not the others.|$|R
