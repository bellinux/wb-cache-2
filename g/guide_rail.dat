25|$|A proper lubricant, {{typically}} graphite powder, is essential. Wheel alignment {{is important}} both to minimize wheel {{contact with the}} axle head and body {{as well as to}} limit the contact between the wheels and <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> as the car travels down the track. There are 32 friction causing surfaces on a pinewood derby car. These include the surfaces of all four wheels which touch either the axle, the body or the track and the surfaces of all four axles which touch the wheel. Neglecting to polish and lubricate any of these 32 surfaces will result in degraded performance. The center of mass of a typical car is low and slightly ahead of the rear axle, which helps the car track straight as well as providing a slight advantage due to the additional gravitational potential energy.|$|E
25|$|The force {{accelerating}} a pinewood derby car is gravity; {{the opposing}} forces are friction and air drag. Therefore, car modifications {{are aimed at}} maximizing the potential energy in the car design and minimizing the air drag and the friction that occurs when the wheel spins on the axle, contacts the axle head or car body, or contacts the track <b>guide</b> <b>rail.</b> Friction due to air drag is a minor, although not insignificant, factor. The wheel tread can be sanded or turned on a lathe and the inner surface of the hub can be tapered to minimize the contact area between the hub and body. Polishing the wheel, especially the inner hub, with a plastic polish can also reduce friction. Often one front wheel is raised slightly {{so that it does}} not contact the track and add to the rolling resistance. Axles are filed or turned on a lathe to remove the burr and crimp marks and polished smooth. More extensive modifications involve tapering the axle head and cutting a notch to minimize the wheel-to-axle contact area. Packs can establish additional rules for what, if any, modifications are allowed. In some areas, no changes can be made to the axles or wheels.|$|E

2500|$|To achieve {{launching}} and {{recovery from the}} airship in flight, a 'skyhook' system was developed. The Sparrowhawk had a hook mounted above its top wing that attached to the cross-bar of a trapeze mounted on the carrier airship. For launching, the biplane's hook was engaged on the trapeze inside the airship's (internal) hangar, the trapeze was lowered clear of the hull into the (moving) airship's slipstream and, engine running, the Sparrowhawk would then disengage its hook and fall away from the airship. For recovery, the biplane would fly underneath its mother ship, until beneath the trapeze, climb up from below, and hook onto the cross-bar. The width of the trapeze cross-bar allowed a certain lateral lee-way in approach, the biplane's hook mounting had a <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> to provide protection for the turning propeller (see photo), and engagement of the hook was automatic on positive contact between hook and trapeze. More than one attempt {{might have to be}} made before a successful engagement was achieved, for example in gusty conditions. Once the Sparrowhawk was securely caught, it could then be hoisted by the trapeze back within the airship's hull, the engine being cut as it passed the hangar door. Although seemingly a tricky maneuver, pilots soon learned the technique and it was described as being much easier than landing on a moving, pitching and rolling aircraft carrier. Almost inevitably, the pilots soon acquired the epithet [...] "The men on the Flying Trapeze" [...] and their aircraft were decorated with appropriate unit emblems.|$|E

50|$|In a true line with, {{and fifteen}} feet {{directly}} above, {{the face of}} the track rail was the lower face of a <b>guide</b> <b>rail,</b> supported from posts arranged {{along the side of the}} track, and on the sides of this <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> run pairs of rubber-faced trolley wheels attached to the top of the locomotive and the cars. The <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> was a simple stringer of yellow pine, 4¼ by 8 inches in section, and the standards on which the wheels are journaled were placed far enough apart to allow a space of 6 inches between the continuous faces of each pair of wheels, thus affording 1¾ inches for lateral play, or sidewise movement toward or from the guard rail, it being designed that the <b>guide</b> <b>rail</b> shall be arranged in the exact line of the true center of gravity of the cars and locomotive. The standards were bolted to six-inch wide strap iron attached to and extending across the top of the car.|$|E

40|$|Warpage is {{a problem}} that {{frequently}} occurs in laser transformation hardening of precision parts. If, for example, the ball bearing tracks of a linear <b>guiding</b> <b>rail</b> are sequentially hardened with a single laser, this results in bending distortion and torsion of the rail. Afterwards the rail has to be straightened manually. This paper presents a multiple laser beam technique for solving this problem. A process controlling modular diode laser system is set up and used for hardening of the four ball bearing tracks of a precision linear <b>guiding</b> <b>rail</b> simultaneously. The diode laser system consists of up to ten modules. Each module is equipped with a pyrometer for temperature measurement and feed back control in each processing zone. By multiple beam technique the torsion of the <b>guiding</b> <b>rail</b> can be completely avoided. The resulting bending distortion can be minimized in a second step by a straightening treatment, using the same modular diode laser system...|$|R
5000|$|More modern pumping {{stations}} do {{not require}} a dry well or pump house and usually consist only of a wet well. In this configuration, submersible sewage pumps with closely coupled electric motor are mounted within the wet well itself, submerged within the sewage. Submersible pumps are mounted on two vertical <b>guide</b> <b>rails</b> and seal onto a permanently fixed [...] "duckfoot", which forms both a mount and also a vertical bend for the discharge pipe. For maintenance or replacement, submersible pumps are raised by a chain off of the duckfoot and up the two <b>guide</b> <b>rails</b> to the maintenance (normally ground) level. Reinstalling the pumps simply reverses this process with the pump being remounted on the <b>guide</b> <b>rails</b> and lowered onto the duckfoot where {{the weight of the}} pump reseals it. As the motors are sealed and weather is not a concern, no above ground structures are required, excepting a small kiosk to contain the electrical switchgear and control systems.|$|R
