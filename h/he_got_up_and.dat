25|$|On 2 November 2012, as Henry {{was telling}} the story of how he had injured his finger the {{previous}} day, his co-presenters and crew slowly left the set, until Henry was left sitting on his own at the desk, in the dark. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> left, before the show cut to a commercial break, after which everybody had returned.|$|E

25|$|One {{day during}} our lunch {{hour in the}} last week of filming, the craft service man handed out slices of {{watermelon}} to each of us. Richard, the whole camera crew, and I sat together in a big sound studio eating a number of watermelon slices, talking and joking. As a gag, some members of the crew used a piece of watermelon as a Frisbee, and tossed it back and forth to each other. One piece of watermelon landed at Richard's feet. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> went home. Filming stopped. The next day, Richard announced that he knew very well what the significance of watermelon was. He said that he was quitting show business and would not return to this film. The day after that, Richard walked in, all smiles. I wasn't privy to all the negotiations that went on between Columbia and Richard's lawyers, but the camera operator who had thrown that errant piece of watermelon had been fired that day. I assume now that Richard was using drugs during Stir Crazy.|$|E

The song began with Geddes sitting on a stool, leaning against the piano, before <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> walked around the stage.|$|E
500|$|Drake was {{accustomed}} to keeping his own hours; he frequently had difficulty sleeping and often stayed up through the night playing and listening to music, then slept late into the following morning.

But it was about 12 o'clock, and I went in, because really it seemed it was time <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>up.</b> <b>And</b> he was lying across the bed.

2500|$|According to {{the account}} in , he was blinded {{for three days}} and had to be led into Damascus by the hand. During these three days, Saul took no food or water and spent his time in prayer to God. When Ananias of Damascus arrived, he laid his hands on him and said: [...] "Brother Saul, the Lord, [...] Jesus, that {{appeared}} unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost." [...] His sight was restored, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> was baptized. This story occurs only in Acts, not in the Pauline epistles.|$|E
2500|$|Bosworth {{initially}} developed lung {{problems when}} he was 10 or 11 years old, shortly after his parents moved to University Place, Nebraska. [...] This occurred when he got overheated in a hot room helping with a friend's operation, {{then went to the}} cold outside and got a chill. [...] The lung problems continued for the next eight years, getting significantly worse {{when he was}} a young man (age 18 or 19), when the doctors diagnosed tuberculosis and [...] said that he would soon die. [...] Bosworth then went from Nebraska to his parents' new home in Fitzgerald Georgia for a last visit and arrived in a near-death state. [...] While there he attended a religious meeting and was approached by an older Methodist [...] "Bible woman" [...] who [...] "used to walk the hills of Georgia and the Carolinas selling Bibles and preaching the gospel." [...] The account written by Bosworth's son in a later printing of [...] "Christ the Healer" [...] says: [...] "She prayed for him, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> he was instantly healed." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{had these}} pieces, these guitar pieces, that I {{wanted to put}} together. I had a whole idea {{of a piece of}} music that I really wanted to try and present to {{everybody}} and try and come to terms with. Bit difficult really, because it started on acoustic, and as you know it goes through to the electric parts. But we had various run-throughs [...] where I was playing the acoustic guitar and jumping up and picking up the electric guitar. Robert was sitting in the corner, or rather leaning against the wall, and as I was routining the rest of the band with this idea and this piece, he was just writing. And all of a sudden <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> started singing, along with another run-through, and he must have had 80% of the words there ... I had these sections, and I knew what order {{they were going to go}} in, but it was just a matter of getting everybody to feel comfortable with each gear shift that was going to be coming.|$|E

2500|$|In 1975, Laughlin {{released}} The Master Gunfighter, {{a western}} {{set in the}} 1840s, detailing {{the plight of the}} Chumash people. Laughlin grew a full beard for the film and his character fought with both a 12-shot revolver and a samurai sword. Although it did reasonably well at the box office, critics were not pleased with the film. He returned to the Billy Jack franchise in 1977. However, the fourth entry in the series, Billy Jack Goes to Washington was a failure because of distribution problems, and it proved to be Laughlin's final film as a director. Laughlin blamed individuals within the United States government for the failure of the picture, telling CNN's Showbiz Tonight in 2005:At a private screening, Senator Vance Hartke [...] got up, because it was about how the Senate was bought out by the nuclear industry. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> charged me. Walter Cronkite's daughter was there, [...] Lucille Ball. And he said, 'You'll never get this released. This house you have, everything will be destroyed.' [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{earned the}} {{nickname}} [...] "One Man Army". On April 19, 1951, Cartagena, [...] "with {{no regard for}} his own safety," [...] as the official record states, left his position and charged directly into devastating enemy fire, single-handedly destroying two enemy emplacements on Hill 206 near [...] "Yonch'on," [...] North Korea. After taking out the emplacements, he was knocked to the ground twice by exploding enemy grenades. Nevertheless, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> attacked three more times, each time destroying an enemy emplacement until he was wounded. On October 19, 2002, during a ceremony honoring the 65th Infantry, {{when he was asked}} about the battle, Cartagena responded that he just hurled back at the Chinese the grenades thrown at him. [...] He thought {{that the rest of the}} squad was behind him, and didn't realize most of them had been wounded and forced to take cover. Later they found 33 dead Chinese in the machine gun and automatic emplacements and they found 15 more dead in the positions he had destroyed on his way up the hill. Cartagena, who had lost a lot of blood, was sent to Taibu in a helicopter and then to Japan to the 128th Marines Hospital where he was hospitalized for 62 days. According to 1st Lt.

2500|$|Henry and Maximilian jointly {{published}} {{an account of}} their victories, under the title; Copia von der erlichen und kostlichen enpfahung ouch früntliche erbietung desz Küngs von Engelland Keyser Maximilian in Bickardy (Picardy) gethon, Unnd von dem angryff und nyderlegung do selbs vor Terbona (Thérouanne) geschähen.

Also what {{and how many people}} there were slain and captured. Also the siege of the town of Tournay and other strange histories.The book contains a woodcut of their meeting and one of Maximilian in battle. The battle at Guinegate was described in this manner;"About twelve o'clock the French in three divisions appeared upon another hill (for here and there are little hills and valleys); {{and as soon as the}} Emperor knew it <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> sent for the German horsemen, numbering scarcely 1,050, and the Burgundians, about 1,000 (or 2,000), and commanded to muster the troops and to keep the Germans by him. The French united in one division amounting to 10,000 (or 7,000) cavalry in array and fired guns at the Emperor's horsemen, but all went too high and did no hurt. Thus the Burgundians and certain English struck , and as they turned and the Emperor saw the Burgundians hard pressed, he at once ordered the German horsemen to attack on the flank; but before they struck the French had turned about and fled. Our horsemen pursued them until within a short mile of their camp and brought back the prisoners and banners hereafter indicated. When the Emperor saw that no more harm could be done them, and they were near their camp wherein were yet 20,000 foot, he retired all the men in good order and marched to the camp, remaining all night in the field. In this skirmish the English used no other cry than Burgundia." ...|$|E
