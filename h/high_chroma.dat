5000|$|The two FM audio {{channels}} {{occupied the}} disc spectrum at 2.3 and 2.8 MHz on NTSC formatted discs and each channel had a 100 kHz FM deviation. The FM audio carrier frequencies {{were chosen to}} minimize their visibility in the video image, so that even with a poorly mastered disc, audio carrier beats in the video {{will be at least}} ‑35 dB down, and thus, invisible. Due to the frequencies chosen, the 2.8 MHz audio carrier (Right Channel) and the lower edge of the chroma signal are very close together and if filters are not carefully set during mastering, there can be interference between the two. In addition, high audio levels combined with <b>high</b> <b>chroma</b> levels can cause mutual interference, leading to beats becoming visible in highly saturated areas of the image. To help deal with this, Pioneer decided to implement the CX Noise Reduction System on the analog tracks. By reducing the dynamic range and peak levels of the audio signals stored on the disc, filtering requirements were relaxed and visible beats greatly reduced or eliminated. The CX system gives a total NR effect of 20 dB, but in the interest of better compatibility for non-decoded playback, Pioneer reduced this to only 14 dB of noise reduction (the RCA CED system used the [...] "original" [...] 20 dB CX system). This also relaxed calibration tolerances in players and helped reduce audible pumping if the CX decoder was not calibrated correctly.|$|E

In both infiltrated and uninfiltrated samples the magenta colour patches showed the biggest total colour change, and in the uninfiltrated samples these were followed by yellow and then cyan. The reverse was observed for infiltrated samples with cyan exhibiting more colour change than yellow. All samples irrespective of the infiltrant became less saturated and faded. All uncoloured samples, infiltrated and non-infiltrated, yellowed during accelerated degradation, but the change was most pronounced in epoxy infiltrated samples [24].|$|R
2500|$|Chroma, {{measured}} radially {{from the}} center of each slice, represents the “purity” of a color (related to saturation), with lower chroma being less pure (more washed out, as in pastels). Note that there is no intrinsic upper limit to chroma. Different areas of the color space have different maximal chroma coordinates. For instance light yellow colors have considerably more potential chroma than light purples, {{due to the nature of}} the eye and the physics of color stimuli. This led to a wide range of possible chroma levels—up to the high 30s for some hue–value combinations (though it is difficult or impossible to make physical objects in colors of such <b>high</b> <b>chromas,</b> and they cannot be reproduced on current computer displays).

When coupled with image analysis software, the usefulness of digital cameras can be increased to advance the field of micropedology.

An objective {{of this study was}} to define and determine an REA for Low Chroma and <b>High</b> <b>Chroma</b> soil redoximorphic features (SRFs) present in claypan soils of northeastern Missouri, USA using a digital camera and image classification techniques. An additional objective was to examine REA differences between these two SRF types, soil depths, and landscape positions to highlight sampling considerations when quantifying SRFs in the field. Three metrics were chosen to quantify SRF heterogeneity, including percent occurrence, mean Euclidean distance, and the Interspersion/Juxtaposition Index. The relative change in these metrics was determined for 16 image sizes ranging from 2. 5 cm 2 to 40 cm 2 and used to identify an REA. Results showed REAs (mean±SE) for Low Chroma (17. 7 cm 2 ± 0. 4) and <b>High</b> <b>Chroma</b> (25. 4 cm 2 ± 0. 7) were significantly different (α= 0. 05). Further review of REAs indicated large sampling diameters (3 ̆e 8 cm) are necessary to simultaneously capture REAs of Low Chroma and <b>High</b> <b>Chroma</b> SRFs. When SRFs were considered separately, a ≥ 5 cm diameter core is recommended to reach an REA for Low Chroma, allowing accurate quantification for soil classification purposes and hydric soil determinations.

In this work, {{the influence of the}} addition of two different enological tannins, mainly composed of hydrolysable (ellagitannins) and condensed tannins, on the evolution of color and pigment composition of two different types of model systems containing the five main grape anthocyanins was studied. In addition, the effect of the addition of an enological tannin on the color and pigment composition of red wines made from Vitis vinifera L. cv Tempranillo grapes was also studied by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS).

40|$|Increased {{awareness}} {{of the economic and}} environmental values of prairie and wetland ecosystems has resulted in numerous areas of cultivated land being converted back to native ecosystems. Little information exists documenting the changes in soils and hydrology on these ecosystems. This dissertation includes studies of the hydrology, the sources of soil spatial variability, and the amount of carbon in restored prairie-wetland complexes in central Iowa. Four general groups were developed to describe soil hydromorphology along the restored prairie-wetland hillslopes. Soil morphology was correlated with hydrology for all groups on the restored hillslopes. Mean and shallowest water table depths varied for all groups. Group I included Clarion and Nicollet soils on upland prairie summits with redoximorphic features restricted to Bg and Cg horizons. Group II soils included Delft and Webster soils on upland prairie-backslopes. Group III soils included Canisteo and Delft soils on wet prairie or sedge wetland-footslopes. In general, group II and III soils had thicker A horizons than group I soils with low chroma mottles or pore linings and Bg horizons with low chroma mottles, <b>high</b> <b>chroma</b> mottles or a combination of both. Group IV soils included dominantly Okoboji soils in closed pond depressions with sola having a mixture of low chroma mottles, <b>high</b> <b>chroma</b> mottles, and low/high chroma pore linings. Soil depth explained most of the systematic variability in available K and P and total and organic C in upland prairies and wetland ecosystems. Sources of variability differed among prairie and wetland ecosystems for coarse silt, clay, bulk density, extractable cations, CEC, and pH. Highest soil microbial biomass C amounts and variability was in the upland prairie-backslopes. Slope position explained 52 % of the total systematic variability in organic C. Soil depth explained for 74 % of the total systematic variability in microbial biomass C. Our studies conclude (i) restored hillslopes are producing significant amounts of microbial biomass and organic C; (ii) longer term monitoring of water tables is required to better understand soil hydromorphic relationships; (iii) spatial relationships and variability attributable to site, transect, vegetation, slope position, and depth should be considered when assessing restored hillslopes...|$|E

This paper describes an initial stage of automatic analysis—the segmentation method for scanned images of Ni-treated wheat roots from hydroponic culture. The main roots of a wheat fibrous system are placed separately in the scanner view area on a <b>high</b> <b>chroma</b> background (blue or red). The first stage of the method includes the transformation of a scanned RGB image into the HCI (Hue-Chroma-Intensity) colour space and then local thresholding of the chroma component to extract a binary root image. Possible chromatic discolourations, different from background colour, are added to the roots from blue or red chroma subcomponent images after thresholding. At the second stage, dark discolourations are extracted by local fuzzy c-means clustering of an HCI intensity image within the binary root mask. Fuzzy clustering is applied in local windows around the series of sample points on roots medial axes (skeleton).

Biocatalyzed electrolysis system (BES) is a new developed technology to degrade organic waste in bioanode and recover recalcitrant contaminants in cathode with effective decoloration. The ion exchange membrane (IEM) separate anode and cathode for biofilm formation protection. Azo removal efficiency was up to 60. 8 %, but decreased to 20. 5 % when IEM was removed. However, expensive ion exchange membrane (IEM) not suitable for further practical application, bioelectrochemical activity of bioanode is sensitive to the toxicity of azo dye. A gradient increase of azo dye concentration was used to acclimate anode biofilm to pollutant toxicity. The azo removal efficiency can be enhanced to 73. 3 % in 10 h reaction period after acclimation. The highest removal efficiency reached 83. 7 % and removal rates were increased to 8. 37 from 3. 04 g/h/L of dual-chamber. That indicated the feasibility for azo dye removal by single-chamber BES. The IEM cancellation not only decreased the internal resistance, but increased the current density and azo dye removal. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

We tested the hypothesis that dietary carotenoid supplementation changes the striking black and yellow coloration of the southern corroboree frog (Pseudophryne corroboree, Amphibia: Anura). Our dietary treatment showed no measurable difference in colour or brightness for black patches in frogs.

Ultrasound at 0. 39 W cm- 2 (20 kHz) resulted in the highest textural hardness values in all the three mushroom varieties. Polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase enzyme activities were also significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced with the increase in ultrasound power during ultrasound-assisted freezing (UAF). These results indicated that UAF can be a suitable technology for industrial freezing of mushroom...|$|R
5000|$|B horizons form below an O, A, or E {{horizon and}} they have {{undergone}} sufficient changes during soil genesis, such that the properties of their original parent material are no longer discernible. The B horizon is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "subsoil". In humid regions, B horizons are the layers of maximum accumulation of materials such as silicate clays, iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) oxides, and organic material. These materials typically accumulate through a process termed illuviation, wherein the materials gradually wash in from the overlying horizons. Accordingly, this layer is also referred to as the [...] "illuviated" [...] horizon or the [...] "zone of accumulation". In addition, it is defined as having a distinctly different structure or consistency than the horizon(s) above and the horizon(s) below. The B horizon may also have stronger colors (<b>higher</b> <b>chroma)</b> than the A horizon. In arid and semiarid regions, calcium carbonate or calcium sulfate may accumulate in the B horizon.|$|R
