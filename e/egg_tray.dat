This research paper is focused on Contextual Inquiry (CI) of refrigerators and related contextual design of <b>egg</b> <b>tray.</b> To understand user perspectives about refrigerators, food items, food carriers and related problems, a CI is conducted with 19 home users from 12 households. The CI has provided vital insights into several major aspects of refrigerators, their usage and user interaction. For example, the maximum weight of a food item stored in refrigerator is about 2  Kg. The selected food carrier for implementation is an <b>egg</b> <b>tray.</b> Such intelligent tray is a specially designed food carrier using a load cell for sensing a weight of eggs stored on it. Thus, a contextual design of <b>egg</b> <b>tray</b> helps in providing information about number of eggs stored on a <b>egg</b> <b>tray.</b> In future, this research work will be extended to other food carriers and related mobile App...|$|E

50|$|The {{reservoir}} feeds a {{fish hatchery}} and stocks the rainbow trout fingerlings. The hatchery {{was set up}} in 1967 close to the dam and draws water from this reservoir. The hatchery was established in the 1970s when 30,000 trout fingerlings were produced and then stocked in the Qargha Reservoir and in many other rivers such as Panjsher, Bamian, Salang and Sarde. The objective of stocking in the reservoir was meant as a recreational fishing activity under licensed sport fishing. Under UNDP/FAO assistance the hatchery was rehabilitated in 1987, and during 1988-89 egg incubators were repaired and set up with new <b>egg</b> <b>trays</b> to restart production. Eggs were imported from Denmark in 1988. These were stocked in the floating cages moored in the reservoir so that fishes grew into marketable size. Concrete raceways adjoining the farm were also repaired and put to use. In 1989, the fish farm was capable of producing 10 tons of rainbow trout. However, subsequently production was affected due to terrorist activity.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of an embryo in an avian egg depends largely on its temperature. The embryo temperature is affected by its environment and the heat produced by the egg. In contemporary incubators, the environment holds the air surrounding the <b>egg,</b> the <b>tray,</b> neighbouring <b>eggs</b> and possibly the incubator itself. In this paper, the heat transfer from one <b>egg</b> in a <b>tray</b> towards its environment is studied by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The objectives are: (1) {{to find out whether}} CFD can successfully simulate eggshell temperature from one <b>egg</b> in a <b>tray,</b> (2) to visualize flow and temperature distribution around the egg in a detailed way, (3) perform sensitivity analysis on several variables affecting heat transfer. To this end, a CFD model is tuned using temperature measurements and validated with an other set of measured data, yielding an effective model. From these simulations, flow and temperature distribution around the egg are visualized. Sensitivity analysis indicate that average eggshell temperature is mainly affected by the inlet air velocity and temperature, flow direction and the metabolic heat of the embryo, but far less by the thermal conductivity and emissivity of the egg and the thermal emissivity of the tray. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} the epidemiology of outbreaks of avian infl uenza A virus (subtypes H 5 N 1, H 9 N 2) in chickens in Bangladesh, we conducted surveys and examined virus isolates. The outbreak began in backyard chickens. Probable sources of infection included <b>egg</b> <b>trays</b> and vehicles from local live bird markets and larger live bird markets. The threat that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A virus subtype H 5 N 1 poses to poultry {{and public health}} has intensified (1). As the virus becomes established in poultry in developing countries, the number of human cases increases (1, 2). Countries in the Asian Association for Regional Co-operation are especially vulnerable to virus perpetuation because of insufficient biosecurity, rearing of chickens and ducks together, selling of live birds, and deficient disease surveillance. To prevent human infection with avian influenza (H 5 N 1), knowledge of avian influenza epidemiology is needed. We therefore describe the epidemiology of HPAI outbreaks in chickens in Bangladesh. The Study Through July 10, 2007, we investigated 52 outbreaks caused by HPAI virus (H 5 N 1) and 3 outbreaks caused by low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus (H 9 N 2) in chickens in Bangladesh.

40|$|The first avian {{adenovirus}} (AAV) {{associated with}} clinical disease was isolated from {{an outbreak of}} respiratory disease in quail in 1950 (Olson, 1950). Since that time, AAVs {{have been found in}} all types and breeds of chickens and from a variety of other avian species. The infections may be asymptomatic or associated with several clinical and pathological conditions. Vertical transmission via the egg is the most common way of transmission. Also horizontal transmission through faeces, contaminated <b>egg</b> <b>trays,</b> crates and trucks {{play a role in the}} infection route. Studies have demonstrated the presence of antibodies in healthy poultry, and viruses have been isolated from normal birds. Avian adenoviruses in chickens are the etiological agents of 2 diseases known as inclusion body hepatitis (IBH) and hydropericardium syndrome (HP). In some cases each condition is observed separately, however, recently the 2 conditions have frequently been observed as a single entity; therefore, the name hepatitis hydropericardium has been widely used to describe the pathologic condition. The syndrome is an acute disease of young chickens associated with anemia, haemorrhagic disorders, hydropericardium and high mortality. Egg-Drop-Syndrome (EDS) is caused also by an adenovirus. The disease is characterised by a severe drop in egg production as well as the production of shell-less, thin-shelled, discoloured or misshapen eggs in apparently healthy birds. Ducks and geese are the natural host of the EDS virus. It was first described in chickens in the 1970 s and spread to several countries world wide. The birds usually do not show any other signs of disease, and mortality is not expected. There is no specific treatment of the AAV infections.

40|$|AbstractThe Southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus – a vector of West Nile virus – is {{equipped}} with 130 odorant receptors (ORs), which enable young females to locate plants and blood-meal sources and older females to find suitable sites for oviposition. In our attempts to de-orphanize ORs expressed in female antennae, we identified CquiOR 37 and CquiOR 99, which were narrowly tuned to two phenolic compounds, 4 -methylphenol and 4 -ethylphenol. When tested in the Xenopus oocyte recording system the observed EC 50 s for 4 -methylphenol and 4 -ethylphenol were 6. 4 and 18. 2  μM for CquiOR 37 and 14. 4 and 0. 74  μM for CquiOR 99 (goodness of fit, R 2  =  0. 88 – 0. 99), respectively. Indoor behavioral assays demonstrated that gravid female mosquitoes laid significantly more <b>eggs</b> in water <b>trays</b> spiked with these compounds than in control water trays. Field studies with gravid traps corroborated that 4 -ethylphenol is active {{in a wide range}} of doses from 0. 1 to 10  μg/l, as required for practical applications. A dsRNA construct based on the two genes, CquiOR 37 / 99 -dsRNA was stable in pupa hemolymph for up to 3  h. Pupae injected with CquiOR 37 / 99 -dsRNA, β-galactosidase-dsRNA or water had more than 40 % survival rate at the peak of oviposition (day- 9). qPCR analysis showed individual variation, but significant mean reduction in CquiOR 37 and CquiOR 99 transcript levels in CquiOR 37 / 99 -dsRNA-treated mosquitoes.

40|$|By December 2007, {{there was}} a {{continuum}} of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H 5 N 1 affected countries along the West African coast from Cote d’Ivoire to Cameroon. In all, 8 countries in West Africa had recorded HPAI H 5 N 1 (Niger, Burkina Faso, Cote D’Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, and Cameroon). There is concern about the danger posed by circulation of the virus as these countries are members of ECOWAS and there is constant movement of people and goods and trade between them. At a workshop in Accra in November 2008, participants identified re-introduction of the virus into Ghana as a major challenge. The risk question posed was “What is the risk of re-introduction of HPAI H 5 N 1 virus from neighbouring countries (Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire and Togo) into Ghana via cross-border trade and movements involving live birds, poultry products and fomites?“. Three release risk pathways involving Cote d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso and Togo were developed. A questionnaire was developed to elicit responses from identified experts to provide information. Credible information was received from Cote d’Ivoire and Burkina Faso. There was no response from Togo. A qualitative risk assessment following the OIE framework was undertaken to address the risk question. The qualitative risk estimates for the release pathways ranged from negligible to very low with high uncertainty. During outbreaks in neighbouring countries when birds are infected, the risks will vary {{and are likely to}} be higher. The highest risk of re-introduction of HPAI H 5 N 1 virus to Ghana is the pathway involving cross-border trade and movement of poultry, poultry products, people and fomites from Cote d’Ivoire with risk estimates being negligible to medium. This is because poultry and poultry products are illegally sent into Ghana (despite a ban on poultry and poultry products) and the existence of farms along the border in the two countries under similar management and therefore sharing facilities. The steps of the pathway for the re-introduction from Cote d’Ivoire to Ghana associated with higher risks included the probabilities of introduction of live birds, <b>eggs</b> and <b>egg</b> <b>trays,</b> and day-old chicks and the probabilities of contamination of traders and poultry workers on small farms. From Burkina Faso, the steps with higher risks posing a threat for re-introduction of HPAI to Ghana included the probabilities of introduction of live household birds; the probability of transporting guinea fowl eggs; the probabilities of contamination and transporting of baskets used for live birds and egg containers; the probability of traders using vehicles to markets and the probability of maize being imported for use as poultry feed. From Togo, the steps with higher risks posing a threat for reintroduction of HPAI to Ghana included the probability of introduction of live household birds; the probability of contamination of poultry workers and the probability of importing frozen turkey tails and carcasses. These could be targeted as preventive or critical mitigation points. The high level of uncertainty associated with most of the risk estimates point to significant gaps in knowledge of the epidemiology of HPAI and/or poultry production or trade in West Africa. Therefore the risk estimates have to be interpreted with extreme caution. There is the need for targeted data collection to fill some of the relevant knowledge gaps. The particular areas are the prevalence of HPAI in household birds and wild and scavenging birds, and movement patterns of people and poultry and poultry products across the borders.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Although Australia is {{free from}} highly {{pathogenic}} avian influenza (HPAI), incursions {{of this disease}} {{have the potential to}} have severe impacts on animal welfare and cause substantial economic losses for Australia’s commercial poultry industries. Australia has experienced five epidemics of HPAI between 1976 and 1997, and has detailed contingency plans for this disease, but the potential consequences and effectiveness of different control and eradication strategies under Australian conditions are not well understood. Epidemiological modelling is a tool {{that can be used to}} combine available information on infection dynamics from field and experimental studies with expert opinion to gain insights into disease transmission and control. This thesis describes the application of modelling tools to study the spread of HPAI within and between farms. In particular, it describes the development, verification, validation, sensitivity analysis and evaluation of a spatial, stochastic simulation model, called AISPREAD, to investigate the potential transmission and control of HPAI in the Australian chicken meat, chicken egg layer, duck and turkey industries. AISPREAD is divided into three modules: a production module to simulate the timing of farm husbandry practices such as routine destocking and visits by service providers; an infection module to simulate the spread of infection between farms by local spread, the movement of live birds and contact networks of service providers; and a mitigations module which implements combinations of realistic outbreak response strategies. AISPREAD is a flexible simulation model that can incorporate different combinations of mitigation strategies including: active and passive surveillance; diagnosis; tracing; zoning; quarantine and movement restrictions; culling, disinfection and decontamination of infected farms; pre-emptive culling; process slaughter of chicken meat broiler and duck and turkey grower farms; and emergency vaccination. Data on the location, ownership, type, capacity, biosecurity and production characteristics and identity of service providers were obtained from a series of cross-sectional surveys of the commercial chicken meat, chicken egg layer, duck and turkey industries conducted in 2005 and 2007. These studies revealed that these industries are functionally distinct and few of the 1594 farms produced multiple species of poultry. However, five Australian poultry production regions had poultry farm densities that were comparable to areas in Canada and Italy that have experienced extensive epidemics of HPAI, indicating that they may be more vulnerable to larger outbreaks. Results also revealed that movements of birds and service providers between farms could lead to the transmission of HPAI between companies, regions or industries. Limited data were available to estimate several important model parameters, including the likelihood of HPAI spreading between farms by different types of indirect contacts; the relative effectiveness of biosecurity measures on different types of farms to prevent indirect transmission of HPAI on fomites; the number of trucks operated by feed mills, hatcheries and waste disposal companies; and the risk of HPAI spread posed by the movement of used cardboard <b>egg</b> <b>trays</b> in the chicken egg layer industry. A modified Delphi conference approach was used in this study to gather the opinions of Australian poultry industry professionals to estimate these parameters. This study confirmed that poultry industry experts considered that indirect contacts by service providers between poultry farms and differences in biosecurity practices between poultry farms would be important in the spread of HPAI amongst poultry farms. In order to investigate within-farm spread of HPAI, a stochastic discrete entity simulation model was developed to estimate parameters regarding the dynamics of HPAI in unvaccinated and vaccinated chicken meat, chicken egg layer, duck and turkey farms. These studies revealed that a 1...|$|R

Eggs from 3 commercial houses (57 wk-old broiler breeders) were collected over 2 d (n = 1, 944 eggs). Half were treated with 1. 5 % H 2 O 2 and UV and the other half served as untreated controls (18 eggs/ tray). At time of treatment, 1 egg was randomly selected from each of 108 trays (n = 54 per treatment) for eggshell APC enumeration on TSA. Remaining eggs were stored at 18. 3 o C. Prior to set, 1 <b>egg</b> per <b>tray</b> from d 1 of collection was sampled for APC enumeration. The 16 remaining eggs/tray were weighed prior to incubation and at 18 d to determine egg weight loss. At hatch (21. 5 d), chick weights were obtained, meconium samples were collected from 18 chicks per incubator and samples were plated on TSA to determine the presence of intestinal microorganisms. A 3 log 10 CFU/egg reduction in eggshell APC was found for treated eggs when compared to control eggs. At hatch, no differences in chick weight, egg weight loss, positive meconium samples, or hatchability were observed between treatments.

It is conceivable that a "clear egg " could create a local thermal environment which would affect adjacent <b>eggs.</b> When a <b>tray</b> of <b>eggs</b> is left out of an incubator {{for a short time}} the clear eggs feel colder than those containing live embryos. Lippincott and Card (1934) state that, in Egyptian hatcheries, differ-ence in temperature when the egg is touched to the skin is the accepted test for fertility. Landauer (1941) cites several investigations showing that variation from optimum incubator temperature (99 ° to The investigation reported in this paper was in connection with a project of the Kentucky Agricul-tural Experiment Station and is published with per-mission of the director. 100 °F. in forced draft incubators) reduces hatchability. Thus a local reduction in temperature near a clear egg might adversely affect nearby embryos. The in-vestigation reported here was made to test this idea...|$|R
50|$|Huhtamäki (styled Huhtamaki) is {{a global}} food {{packaging}} specialist, headquartered in Espoo, Finland. Its primary outputs include paper and plastic disposable tableware, such as cups, plates and containers for quick service restaurants, coffee shops, retail stores, caterers and vending operators (e.g. coated paper cups for fast food chains like Burger King) as well as flexible packaging and labels for food and drink, pet food, pharmaceuticals, household and hygiene brands. Huhtamaki also makes <b>egg</b> cartons and <b>trays,</b> fruit trays and cup carriers. The company is a pioneer in exploring and using new sustainable materials such as bio-plastics and recyclable materials. Huhtamaki was initially established as a manufacturer of confectionery in 1920 in Finland and grew in size over the years, eventually becoming an industrial conglomerate with such diverse product lines as ladies' clothing, pharmaceuticals and electronic components. A packaging division was established in 1965 under the Polarpak brand. In 1988, the company decided to concentrate on a single business area where it could be world-leading. Many business units were divested over the following decade, including the pharmaceutical division Leiras (sold to Schering) and the original candy business (which by this point included the Leaf brand). During the same period, {{a large number of}} packaging companies were acquired. Today Huhtamäki is solely focused on the packaging sector with around 16,000 employees in over 30 countries. Its North American operations are based in De Soto, Kansas. The parent company Huhtamäki Oyj is listed on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd.|$|R
40|$|The Formation Design of Noise Reducers from Plywood, Foam, Tray, dan Coconut Fiber for Static Sources. Research was {{conducted}} in a semi-anechoic room using a method referring to the ISO 3745. The design used is the Hemisphere in which the source of noise is analogous to engines in an industry. The value reduction {{in the rate of}} sound power is obtained by comparing the sound power level before and after control is given. The noise control test materials used consist of layers of plywood, foam, fiber and <b>tray</b> (<b>egg</b> box). The effectiveness of these materials is tested by measuring the sound transmission loss (STL). Test results reveal that the sound power level (Lw) of the source of noise produces a high Lw which is 99. 6 dB. at a frequency of 8000 Hz. The measurement of Lw on the source of noise which is covered by plywood produces a total of 78. 66 dB Lw with an Lw reduction of 21. 02 %. The measurement on the sound source covered by plywood and foam materials produces a total of 47. 79 dB Lw with an Lw reduction of 52. 02 %. The measurement of Lw by combining plywood, foam, and tray produces a total of 33. 02 dB Lw with an Lw reduction of 66. 84 %. The measurement of the total Lw after being covered by plywood, foam, fiber, and tray is a total of 31. 94 Lw dB with an Lw reduction of 67. 93 %...|$|R
