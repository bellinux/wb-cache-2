2500|$|Chesterton usually wore a {{cape and}} a {{crumpled}} hat, with a swordstick in hand, and a cigar {{hanging out of}} his mouth. He {{had a tendency to}} <b>forget</b> <b>where</b> {{he was supposed to be}} going and miss the train that was supposed to take him there. It is reported that on several occasions he sent a telegram to his wife Frances from some distant (and incorrect) location, writing such things as [...] "Am in Market Harborough. Where ought I to be?" [...] to which she would reply, [...] "Home". [...] (Chesterton himself tells the story, omitting, however, his wife's alleged reply, in ch. XVI of his autobiography.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Cheyenne Record {{consulted}} Toni Cottura, Thorsten Brötzmann, Marcus Brosch, and Marc Mozart to {{work with}} the group on their debut hip hop and R–influenced debut album. Released in January 2002, Never <b>Forget</b> (<b>Where</b> You Come From) reached number one in Austria and Germany and peaked at number six on the Swiss Singles Chart. Reaching sales in excess of more than 450,000 units, the album became the eleventh biggest-selling album of the year in Germany. Due to the sheer volume of interest, Never Forget spawned another two top ten hits with [...] "Do You" [...] and [...] "Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel". In the meantime, Bro'Sis finished a short club tour and appeared as a supporting act on O-Town's blitz tour.|$|E

2500|$|Hanson {{has argued}} that the U.S. may be forced to take a much more confrontational stance towards Iranian {{violation}} of prior nuclear enrichment prohibitions, advocating, if necessary, [...] unilateral responses to the country should it continue its aggressive acts of war. On the Hugh Hewitt show in August 2007, Hanson stated, [...] "We really need to start doing some things beyond talking, and if that is going into Iranian airspace, or buzzing Iranians, or even starting to <b>forget</b> <b>where</b> the border is and taking out some of these training camps, we need to do that and send a message, because they're a paper tiger. They really are." [...] In a 2014 column Hanson faulted the Obama administration for engaging in [...] "appeasement" [...] of Iran and of fruitlessly attempting to negotiate an end to the Iranian program to acquire nuclear weapons, predicating if Iran continued enrichment unchecked that: [...] "Accordingly, it is more than likely that {{in the next two years}} Iran will become a nuclear power." ...|$|E
2500|$|McFly {{have been}} cited as having {{influenced}} a number of high-profile musicians in various different ways. Of particular note are Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction, who have credited McFly as the opening act of the first concert they had ever attended. Speaking about meeting with the group, Jones said [...] "it turned out that Niall and Louis were at one of our first ever shows. And they were all like, 'we copied your haircuts, and you made us want to play guitar', which is really amazing to hear. They're the biggest band {{in the world right}} now. And their favourite band was us! We influenced them. It's really strange, because you feel like a veteran!". [...] Reviews for One Direction's debut album Up All Night had credited McFly as a notable influence, and Horan stated the group were very happy to have such a comparison noted. McFly had contributed song-writing to the first three studio albums that the group released. The group's debut featured the Fletcher-penned track I Want, while the group's 2nd album Take Me Home featured the song I Would penned by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. Deluxe editions of the album also featured Irresistible, a track penned by all 5 members of One Direction alongside Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. This track marked the first time Jones was credited as the producer of any McFly-penned song for the group, with this trait continuing for later songs. Horan has since established a professional relationship with McFly, co-writing a number of album tracks for One Direction with Fletcher, Jones and Poynter, including the song Don't <b>Forget</b> <b>Where</b> You Belong from their 3rd album Midnight Memories, having previously credited them for teaching the group songwriting techniques. Horan, Fletcher, Jones and Poynter had written three songs together for the group's 4th album, due for release in late 2014. Despite this, none of the tracks were chosen for the release, marking the first time the band were not featured on the group's songwriting credits on any studio album. However, Horan has returned to work with the band for the group's 5th studio album in 2015, penning two tracks with Fletcher and Jones which are presently in production. On 16 June 2014, Horan told the group's audience at the Parken Stadium in Denmark that McBusted supporting the group was [...] "something special" [...] because [...] "they were a lot of our favourite bands when we were growing up". One Direction have also praised McFly as role models for longevity, having stayed together as a band for over a decade. Tomlinson said [...] "Oh, they're great role models. They've been through it, so it was really nice to have the chance to talk to them about their experiences. They've been so successful because they've managed to be themselves from the start. There aren't any egos, you know? I think that's really important in a band." ...|$|E
