It was revealed by Jonathan Davis that vocals were actually tracked in the singer's home theater or in closets and hotels everywhere from Korea to Japan.|$|E

Based on that conversation, Ellis wrote [...] "Islam Expert Warns of [...] Nuclear Terror Devices Inside U.S.," [...] an article for the Christian news service ASSIST. Morey explained in the interview [...] "I have Middle Eastern friends throughout the U.S. who continually <b>feed</b> <b>me</b> information {{as to what the}} terrorists are up to". [...] "I, in turn, feed that information to the FBI and Naval Intelligence. I’ve been right so many times the FBI showed up at my house, suspicious {{as to whether or not}} I was somehow involved—because I knew too much. I simply pointed out to them they don’t have their ear to the ground in the Middle Eastern community." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Oliver {{initiated}} a campaign originally called <b>Feed</b> <b>Me</b> Better to move British schoolchildren towards eating healthy foods and cutting out junk food.

Delving into politics to push for changes in nutrition resulted in people voting him as the [...] "Most Inspiring Political Figure of 2005," [...] according to a Channel 4 News annual viewer poll. His emphasis on cooking fresh, nutritious food continued as he created Jamie's Ministry of Food, a television series where Oliver travelled to inspire everyday people in Rotherham, Yorkshire, to cook healthy meals. Another television series is Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution (2010–11), where he travelled first to Huntington, West Virginia and then to Los Angeles {{to change the way}} Americans eat, and address their dependence on fast food.|$|E

6000|$|Invitations {{to dinner}} poured in on Martin; {{and the more}} they poured, the more he puzzled. He sat, the guest of honor, at an Arden Club banquet, with men of note whom he had heard about and read about all his life; and they told him how, when they had read [...] "The Ring of Bells" [...] in the Transcontinental, and [...] "The Peri and the Pearl" [...] in The Hornet, they had {{immediately}} picked him for a winner. My God! and I was hungry and in rags, he thought to himself. Why didn't {{you give me a}} dinner then? Then was the time. It was work performed. If you are feeding me now for work performed, why did you not <b>feed</b> <b>me</b> then when I needed it? Not one word in [...] "The Ring of Bells," [...] nor in [...] "The Peri and the Pearl" [...] has been changed. No; you're not feeding me now for work performed. You are feeding me because everybody else is feeding me and because it is an honor to <b>feed</b> <b>me.</b> You are feeding me now because you are herd animals; because you are part of the mob; because the one blind, automatic thought in the mob-mind just now is to <b>feed</b> <b>me.</b> And where does Martin Eden and the work Martin Eden performed come in in all this? he asked himself plaintively, then arose to respond cleverly and wittily to a clever and witty toast.|$|E

60|$|I knew {{full well}} she meant it, and {{the terror of}} losing her kept me silent.

40|$|Males of {{some species}} {{included}} in the Bactrocera dorsalis complex are strongly attracted to methyl eugenol (ME) (1, 2 -dimethoxy- 4 -(2 -propenyl) benzene), a natural compound occurring {{in a variety of}} plant species. <b>ME</b> <b>feeding</b> of males of the B. dorsalis complex is known to enhance their mating competitiveness. Within B. dorsalis, recent studies show that Asian and African populations of B. dorsalis are sexually compatible, while populations of B. dorsalis and Bactrocera carambolae are relatively incompatible. The objectives of this study were to examine whether <b>ME</b> <b>feeding</b> by males affects mating compatibility between Asian and African populations of B. dorsalis and <b>ME</b> <b>feeding</b> reduces male mating incompatibility between B. dorsalis (Asian population) and B. carambolae. The data confirmed that Asian and African populations of B. dorsalis are sexually compatible for mating and showed that <b>ME</b> <b>feeding</b> only increased the number of matings. Though <b>ME</b> <b>feeding</b> also increased the number of matings of B. dorsalis (Asian population) and B. carambolae males but the sexual incompatibility between both species was not reduced by treatment with ME. These results conform to the efforts resolving the biological species limits among B. dorsalis complex and have implications for fruit fly control programs in fields and horticultural trade...|$|R
