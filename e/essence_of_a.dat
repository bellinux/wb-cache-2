25|$|Conversion, being a {{wrongful}} act, cannot {{spring from}} the exercise of a legal right. Such acts include the right of execution on a legal judgment or contesting rights under a contract.

To constitute a conversion of a chattel, there must be an unauthorized assumption of the right to possession or ownership. The act must have the <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tort.|$|E

25|$|The Congregation for Clergy {{explained}} that Lennon was given {{sufficient time to}} present information to solidify his decisions to the Dicastery, and to forward all of the acts pertinent in the matter to the Congregation. The absence of any decree from Lennon, indicating and formalizing his dispositions made in his March 12, 2009 letter to the pastor, troubled the judges. The Congregation for Clergy reasoned {{that even if the}} March 12, 2009 letter to the pastor was taken as a manifestation of Lennon's dispositions in the matter, which is the <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> decree, the Congregation for Clergy clearly saw that it lacked elements required by the canons.

25|$|In the Zohar {{there are}} more {{sections}} that are of different nature {{with regard to their}} contents and importance, as follows: Idra deVei Mashkana ("Assembly of the House of the Tabernacle") deals mainly with the secrets of prayer, and is found in the Zohar Vol. 2, parashat Mishpatim (pp.122b-123b). Heikhalot ("Palaces") deals in describing the palaces of Gan Eden, and Gehinom, and contains many matters related to prayer. It is found in the Zohar Vol. 1, parashat Bereishit (pp 38a-45b); Vol. 2 parashat Pekudei (pp.244b-262b, heikhalot of holiness; pp.262b-268b, heikhalot of impurity). Raza deRazin ("Secret of Secrets") deals with revealing the <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man via the features of his face and hands. It is found in the Zohar Vol. 2,parashat Yitro (pp.70a-75a). Saba deMishpatim ("The Elder on Statutes") is the commentary of Rav Yiba Saba regarding transmigration of souls, and punishments of the body in the grave. It is found in the Zohar Vol. 2,parashat Mishpatim (pp.94a-114a). Tosefta are paragraphs containing the beginnings of chapters on the wisdom of the Kabbalah of the Zohar, and it is dispersed in all three volumes of the Zohar. Sitrei Torah are drashas of verses from the Torah regarding matters of the soul and the secret of Divinity, and they are dispersed in the Zohar Vol. 1.|$|E
25|$|All robots {{contain some}} level of {{computer}} programming code. A program is how a robot decides when or how to do something. In the caterpillar track example, a robot that needs to move across a muddy road may have the correct mechanical construction and receive the correct amount of power from its battery, but would not go anywhere without a program telling it to move. Programs are the core <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> robot, it could have excellent mechanical and electrical construction, but if its program is poorly constructed its performance will be very poor (or it may not perform at all). There are three different types of robotic programs: remote control, artificial intelligence and hybrid. A robot with remote control programing has a preexisting set of commands that it will only perform if and when it receives a signal from a control source, typically a human being with a remote control. It is perhaps more appropriate to view devices controlled primarily by human commands as falling in the discipline of automation rather than robotics. Robots that use artificial intelligence interact with their environment on their own without a control source, and can determine reactions to objects and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming. Hybrid {{is a form of}} programming that incorporates both AI and RC functions.|$|E

500|$|Bertrand Russell, {{during his}} early Hegelian phase, {{accepted}} the argument; he once exclaimed: [...] "Great God in Boots!—the ontological argument is sound!" [...] However, he later criticized the argument, asserting that [...] "the argument does not, {{to a modern}} mind, seem very convincing, but {{it is easier to}} feel convinced that it must be fallacious than it is to find out precisely where the fallacy lies." [...] He drew a distinction between existence and essence, arguing that the <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person can be described and their existence still remain in question.|$|E
500|$|Kant {{goes on to}} write, [...] "'being' is evidently not a real predicate" [...] and {{cannot be}} part of the concept of something. He proposes that {{existence}} is not a predicate, or quality. This is because existence does not add to the <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> being, but merely indicates its occurrence in reality. He states that by taking the subject of God with all its predicates and then asserting that God exists, [...] "I add no new predicate to the conception of God". He argues that the ontological argument works only if existence is a predicate; if this is not so, he claims the ontological argument is invalidated, as it is then conceivable a completely perfect being doesn't exist.|$|E
500|$|In an {{overview}} of the songs in 1973, the musical scholar Yvonne Gouverné said, [...] "With Poulenc, the melodic line matches the text so well that it seems in some way to complete it, thanks to the gift which the music has for penetrating the very <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given poem; nobody has better crafted a phrase than Poulenc, highlighting the colour of the words." [...] Among the lighter pieces, one of the composer's most popular songs is a setting of Les Chemins de l'amour for Jean Anouilh's 1940 play as a Parisian waltz; by contrast his [...] "monologue" [...] "La Dame de Monte Carlo", (1961) a depiction of an elderly woman addicted to gambling, shows the composer's painful understanding of the horrors of depression.|$|E

500|$|Stravinsky {{worked through}} the winter of 1909–10, in close {{association}} with Fokine who was choreographing The Firebird. During this period Stravinsky made the acquaintance of Nijinsky who, although not dancing in the ballet, was a keen observer of its development. Stravinsky was uncomplimentary when recording his first impressions of the dancer, observing that he seemed immature and gauche for his age (he was 21). On the other hand, Stravinsky found Diaghilev an inspiration, [...] "the very <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> great personality". The Firebird was premiered on 25 June 1910, with Tamara Karsavina in the main role, and was a great public success. This ensured that the Diaghilev–Stravinsky collaboration would continue, {{in the first instance}} with Petrushka (1911) and then The Rite of Spring.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, who praised its honest and vulnerable nature and considered it her most personal solo album. However, some critics thought {{the album was}} too [...] "calculated" [...] and did not capture the <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "breakup album" [...] because it lacked a clear focus. Commercially, the album was moderately successful, becoming Stefani's first {{number one on the}} Billboard 200; in several other major music markets, it peaked within the top 40 on the charts. To promote the album further, Stefani embarked on her This Is What the Truth Feels Like Tour with rapper Eve in North America and headlined the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre Final Shows with opening act Young the Giant.|$|E
500|$|Although {{developers}} billed {{a realistic}} atmosphere, reviewers criticized {{that aspect of}} the game. [...] "I understand the emphasis for this game is on the gameplay. However, a little more effort {{could have been made}} with the visuals and particularly in the audio department. Crowds will applaud your great plays and touchdowns, but the <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> football game revolves around atmosphere. Here, it’s completely lacking," [...] said Acevedo in his review. The game was also criticized for its lack of play-by-play and poor audio. [...] "There's no witty banter between a play-by-play announcer and color commentator (although some would argue that Madden's audio presentation's been seriously lacking the past few iterations), there's no stadium music aside from “Boom” by P.O.D. being played during kickoffs (it gets old pretty fast), and the stadium crowds are basically an afterthought," [...] added Doug Aamoth of Techland. After the patch, the song only comes up for the first kick-off and the kick-off of the second half.|$|E

500|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, there were enough college teams in the East that the first intercollegiate {{competitions}} could be played out. Although the sport continued to grow, Naismith long regarded the game as a curiosity and preferred gymnastics and wrestling as better forms of physical activity. However, basketball became a demonstration sport at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis. As the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame reports, Naismith was also neither interested in self-promotion nor in the glory of competitive sports. Instead, he was more interested in his physical education career, receiving an honorary PE Masters degree in 1910, patrolled the Mexican border for four months in 1916, traveled to France, published two books (A Modern College in 1911 and <b>Essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Healthy Life in 1918). He took American citizenship in 1925. [...] In 1909, Naismith's duties at Kansas were redefined as a Professorship; he served as the de facto athletic director at Kansas for much of the early 20th century.|$|E
500|$|The {{placement}} of carrel spaces at the periphery {{was the product}} of thinking that began years earlier when Kahn submitted proposals for a new library at Washington University. There he dispensed with the traditional arrangement of completely separate library spaces for books and readers, usually with book stacks {{on the periphery of the}} library and reading rooms toward the center. [...] Instead he felt that reading spaces should be near the books and also to natural light. For Kahn, the <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> library was the act of taking a book from a shelf and walking a few steps to a window for a closer look: [...] "A man with a book goes to the light. [...] A library begins that way. [...] He will not go fifty feet away to an electric light." [...] Each carrel area is associated with two levels of book stacks, with the upper level structured as a mezzanine that overlooks the carrels. [...] The book stacks also look out into the atrium.|$|E
500|$|The team {{chose to}} centre {{the game on}} firefighters as they felt that fire was the most {{appropriate}} way to create fear and tension. In a retrospective interview, Ohshima said {{that many of the}} things done by firefighters—along with rescuing people—were [...] "the very <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Sonic Team game", and that they recognised that a firefighter was a hero with whom people could identify. The team wanted to make a game with a rescue theme as Naka thought there were few games based on that concept. According to Takeo Miyoshi, [...] "Our first inspiration came from the explosion and building destruction scenes of Hollywood movies. We just wanted to describe the heroism of lifesaving in that loud, explosive type of setting." [...] The developers wanted to design a future that was [...] "clean and beautiful", with sustainable energy, but where disasters still could occur, and only heroes could protect people from them. The designers envisioned that a futuristic firefighter would be acrobatic and dexterous to reach places where people were trapped.|$|E
