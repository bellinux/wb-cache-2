5|$|As Rand's story begins, he is {{restoring}} {{order in}} the nation of Arad Doman while searching for Graendal, one of the Dark One's favored servants known as the Forsaken. The Aes Sedai work with Rand to interrogate Semirhage, another Forsaken captured {{at the end of}} Knife of Dreams. After being freed by her allies, Semirhage is given a Domination Band, an item used to control male channelers, and locks it around Rand's neck. She and Black Ajah sister Elza Penfell use it to make him torture and attempt to kill his lover, Min Farshaw. Unable to channel, he reaches out and inexplicably accesses the True Power, a different power normally only granted by the Dark One, using it to free himself and kill Semirhage and Elza. After this, he resolves to make himself harder and emotionless. He banishes his adviser Cadsuane Melaidhrin for not securing the Domination Band, promising to kill her <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> her face again.|$|E
2500|$|Lumet {{had always}} {{preferred}} naturalism and/or realism, according to Joanna Rapf. He {{did not like}} the [...] "decorator's look", where the camera could call attention to itself.

He has stated: [...] "Not one [...] belongs to strange-looking creatures {{in the course of}} development of the kind supposed by evolutionists." [...] Dr Kevin Padian at the University of California has criticized the notion that such fossils do not exist, stating that Oktar [...] "does not have any sense of what we know about how things change through time. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> a fossil crab, he says, 'It looks just like a regular crab, there's no evolution.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the 1985 World Series, Denkinger received many hateful letters (including death threats) from Cardinals fans. Two St. Louis disc jockeys went so far as to reveal Denkinger's telephone number and home address. Denkinger claimed that the letters continued on through 1987 (before Denkinger got into contact with Major League Baseball Security, who in turn contacted the FBI), when the Cardinals were ramping up for another World Series appearance (this time against the Minnesota Twins). The breaking point for Denkinger was when he received a particularly menacing letter (with no return address) in which the writer tells that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> Denkinger in person, he would [...] "blow him away" [...] with a [...]357 Magnum.|$|E
