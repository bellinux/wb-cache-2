5|$|Currently, {{solid-phase}} oligonucleotide synthesis {{is carried}} out automatically using computer-controlled instruments (oligonucleotide synthesizers) and is technically implemented <b>in</b> <b>column,</b> multi-well plate, and array formats. The column format is best suited for research and large scale applications where a high-throughput is not required. Multi-well plate format is designed specifically for high-throughput synthesis on small scale to satisfy the growing demand of industry and academia for synthetic oligonucleotides. A number of oligonucleotide synthesizers for small scale synthesis and medium to large scale synthesis are available commercially.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{told the}} men to load their weapons but not to fire unless fired upon, and then ordered them to advance. Laurie ordered the British {{companies}} guarding the bridge to retreat across it. One officer then tried to pull up the loose planks of the bridge to impede the colonial advance, but Major Buttrick began to yell at the regulars to stop harming the bridge. The Minutemen and militia from Concord, Acton {{and a handful of}} Westford Minutemen, advanced <b>in</b> <b>column</b> formation, two by two, led by Major Buttrick, Lt. Col. Robinson, then Capt. Davis, on the light infantry, keeping to the road, since it was surrounded by the spring floodwaters of the Concord River.|$|E

As can easily be seen, there are substantial differences from the corresponding results in the MENA sample. Indeed, for the Non-MENA sample, none of the direct effects of Mean Obstacle Labor are negative and statistically significant. Yet, {{the effects of the}} interactions involving textiles and lack of access to external finance <b>in</b> <b>columns</b> (7) and (8) are positive and significant (just as they were <b>in</b> <b>columns</b> (4) and (5) for MENA firms), presumably for similar reasons.|$|R
5|$|Scott {{crafted a}} simple battle {{plan for the}} {{expected}} engagement. His ships would steam <b>in</b> <b>column</b> with his destroyers at {{the front and rear}} of his cruiser column, searching across a 300 degree arc with SG surface radar in an effort to gain positional advantage on the approaching enemy force. The destroyers were to illuminate any targets with searchlights and discharge torpedoes while the cruisers were to open fire at any available targets without awaiting orders. The cruiser's float aircraft, launched in advance, were to find and illuminate the Japanese warships with flares. Although Helena and Boise carried the new, greatly improved SG radar, Scott chose San Francisco as his flagship.|$|E
25|$|On 1 November 1796, Davidovich's Tyrol Corps {{numbered}} 18,427 {{infantry and}} 1,049 cavalry. The corps was split into six brigade-size columns under Generals-major Johann Loudon, Joseph Ocskay von Ocsko, Sporck, and Josef Philipp Vukassovich and Colonel Seulen. Loudon commanded 3,915 infantry and 362 cavalry <b>in</b> <b>Column</b> 1, Ocskay led 4,200-foot soldiers and 463 horsemen <b>in</b> <b>Column</b> 2, Spork directed 2,560 infantry <b>in</b> <b>Column</b> 3, Vukassovich supervised both Column 4 with 3,772-foot and 30 horse and Column 5 with 2,958-foot and 120 horse, and Seulen led 1,022 infantry and 74 cavalry <b>in</b> <b>Column</b> 6.

For example, in row L (from LEMON), the ciphertext L appears <b>in</b> <b>column</b> A, which is the first plaintext letter. Next we go to row E (from LEMON), locate the ciphertext X which is found <b>in</b> <b>column</b> T, thus T is the second plaintext letter.|$|E

He attacked on a three-battalion front, with the full-strength 1st/401st GIR on the left, the 3rd/501st in the center, and the 506th PIR {{on the right}} <b>in</b> <b>column.</b> Because of the hedgerow terrain, each battalion attacked with two companies on line, platoons <b>in</b> <b>column.</b> 1st/401st was to strike for Dead Man's Corner, 3rd/501st for the Carentan highway just below the village, and the 506th directly into Saint Côme-du-Mont. The artillery would provide a rolling barrage shifting every four minutes. In all the 65th Armored Field Artillery Battalion fired 2,500 rounds of 105mm ammunition into the defenders of Saint Come-du-Mont in the first 90 minutes of fighting.|$|E

25|$|Brandy {{is usually}} {{produced}} in pot stills (batch distillation), but the column still {{can also be}} used for continuous distillation. Distillate obtained in this manner has a higher alcohol concentration (approximately 90% ABV) and is less aromatic. Choice of the apparatus depends on the style of brandy produced. Cognac and South African brandy are examples of brandy produced in batches while many American brandies use fractional distillation <b>in</b> <b>column</b> stills.|$|E
25|$|The weather on {{the next}} day, November 6, was stormy, so Du Pont {{postponed}} the attack for one more day. During the delay, Commander Charles Henry Davis, Du Pont's fleet captain and chief of staff, had the idea of keeping the ships in motion while bombarding the forts. This was a tactic that had recently been used successfully at the Battle of Hatteras Inlet. He presented his idea to the flag officer, who agreed. The plan as completed by Du Pont called for his fleet to enter the harbor at mid-channel. On the way in, they would engage both forts. After passing the forts, the heaviest ships would execute a turn to the left <b>in</b> <b>column</b> and go back against Fort Walker. Again past the fort, they would once more turn <b>in</b> <b>column,</b> and repeat the maneuver until the issue was decided. While the main fleet was thus engaged, five of his lighter gunboats would form a flanking column that would proceed {{to the head of}} the harbor and shield the rest of the fleet from Tattnall's flotilla.|$|E

After the Prussians repelled the French at Ligny which left the Prussian 4th Brigade (Donnersmarck's) in possession of the village supported by the 3rd Brigade (General Jagow's); the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 7th Regiment (of Jagow's Brigade) were ordered to traverse the village, and to advance <b>in</b> <b>column</b> against the French.

25|$|Saint-Cyr {{knew that}} time was of the essence. The last rations had been eaten, {{ammunition}} was running low, and every minute of delay allowed Lazán to close in on his rear. Instructing Chabot to hold the Trentapassos defile with three battalions, the French commander determined to smash through Vives' lines with the remaining 23 battalions. Pino's Italian division was in front, followed by Souham's French division. Saint-Cyr ordered Pino to keep his battalions <b>in</b> <b>column</b> formation and crash through the enemy lines by sheer impetus. Pino was forbidden to deploy a single battalion, not even to take prisoners.|$|E
