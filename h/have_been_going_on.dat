5|$|The {{definition}} of leg before wicket (lbw) is currently Law 36 in the Laws of Cricket, {{written by the}} Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Before a batsman can be dismissed lbw, the fielding team must appeal to the umpire. If the bowler delivers a no ball — an illegal delivery — the batsman cannot be out lbw under any circumstances. Otherwise, for the batsman to be adjudged lbw, the ball, if it bounces, must pitch in line with or on the off side of the wickets. Then the ball must strike part of the batsman's body without first touching his bat, {{in line with the}} wickets and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> to hit the stumps. The batsman may also be out lbw if, having made no attempt to hit the ball with his bat, he is struck outside the line of off stump by a ball that would have hit the wickets. The umpire must assume that the ball would have continued on the same trajectory after striking the batsman, even if it would have bounced before hitting the stumps.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between Moldova and Russia deteriorated in November 2003 over a Russian {{proposal for the}} solution of the Transnistrian conflict, which Moldovan authorities refused to accept because it stipulated a 20-year Russian military presence in Moldova. The federalization plan for Moldova would have also turned Transnistria and Gagauzia into a blocking minority over all major policy matters of Moldova. As of 2006, approximately 1,200 of the 14th Army personnel remain stationed in Transnistria, guarding a large ammunitions depot at Colbasna. In recent years, negotiations between the Transnistrian and Moldovan leaders <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> under the mediation of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Russia, and Ukraine; lately observers from the European Union and the United States have become involved, creating a 5+2 format.|$|E
25|$|The Camposanto Monumentale once {{contained}} a large collection of Roman sculptures and sarcophagi, {{but now there}} are only 84 remaining. The walls were once covered in frescoes, the first were applied in 1360, the last about three centuries later. The Stories of the Old Testament by Benozzo Gozzoli (c. 15th century) were situated in the north gallery, while the south arcade was famous for the Stories of the Genesis by Piero di Puccio (c. late 15th century). The most remarkable fresco is The Triumph of Death, a realistic work by Buonamico Buffalmacco. On 27 July 1944, incendiary bombs dropped by Allied aircraft set {{the roof of the}} building on fire and covered them in molten lead, all but destroying them. Since 1945, restoration works <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> and now the Campo Santo has been brought back to its original state.|$|E
25|$|Drum line battles <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> for years, {{but not in}} a formal, {{competitive}} format. In DrumLine Battle, drum {{lines of}} up to 30 marching members (no grounded percussion) compete in head-to-head judged competition. The competitions may be held either live and face-to-face or online, allowing groups {{from all over the world}} to compete against each other. Judging criteria is not restricted to technical proficiency, but includes showmanship and attitude. In 2014, the drum line from E-Sarn, one of Thailand's top drum and bugle corps, traveled to Indianapolis to compete in the DrumLine Battle contest held during DCI Championship week and defeated the drum lines from 15 U.S. drum corps and marching bands. One of the other 2014 competitors in Indianapolis was the River City Rhythm drum line from Minnesota which transitioned into the River City Rhythm Drum and Bugle Corps and entered into DCI Open Class competition in 2015.|$|E

25|$|The {{field of}} island {{restoration}} is usually credited with having been started in New Zealand in the 1960s, but other smaller projects, {{such as the}} restoration of Nonsuch Island in Bermuda (which began in 1962) <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> for almost as long. Nevertheless, the program undertaken by the Department of Conservation (DOC) {{is one of the}} largest in the world. It began on Cuvier Island, where ecologists removed stock, goats, feral cats and finally, in 1993, Pacific rats. The success of the project resulted in similar projects around New Zealand. The advantages to the DOC were considerable; in addition to protecting species endemic to smaller islands, like the magenta petrel, islands near the mainland, once restored, could act as habitat for species of birds that were unable to survive on the mainland. Species like the takahe, where the remaining wild population was at considerable risk from feral cats and dogs, could be moved to these islands to safeguard the species.|$|E
500|$|Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine {{pointed out}} that {{although}} the episode mocked drug addicts and handicapped children, it did not face the kind of censorship [...] "200" [...] and [...] "201" [...] did, which he suggested proved that censorship was born of fear rather than ethics. Delgado also said the comparison of handicapped children to Looney Tunes characters [...] "should remind us all that such cruel portrayals of disabled people <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> for years". Others criticized the episode. MTV writer Adam Rosenberg thought the episode [...] "just wasn't very funny", and said it missed an opportunity to continue the creative edginess demonstrated in [...] "200" [...] and [...] "201". Rosenberg found the jokes about handicapped children [...] "pointlessly mean", and said {{the fact that they}} are allowed where depictions of Muhammad are censored [...] "makes a point about the absurdity of what is and isn't TV-acceptable". The television website TV Fanatic praised the Towelie storyline and the use of his son [...] "Washcloth", but said the jokes about the handicapped children were unfunny and irritating. The site called it [...] "by far the weakest of the season" [...] and a disappointment following [...] "200" [...] and [...] "201".|$|E

Most quit the project in disgust or were fired for insubordination. A few became ETH supporters. Perhaps the best known example is David Saunders, who in his 1968 book UFOs? Yes lambasted Condon for extreme bias and ignoring or misrepresenting critical evidence. Saunders wrote, [...] "It is clear... that the sightings <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> for too long to explain in terms of straightforward terrestrial intelligence.
