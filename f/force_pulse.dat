40|$|Continuous {{force output}} {{containing}} numerous intermittent force pulses {{is not completely}} smooth. By characterizing force fluctuation properties and <b>force</b> <b>pulse</b> metrics, this study investigated adaptive changes in trajectory control, both force-generating capacity and force fluctuations, as fatigue progresses. Sixteen healthy subjects (20 - 24 years old) completed rhythmic isometric gripping with the non-dominant hand to volitional failure. Before and immediately following the fatigue intervention, we measured the gripping force to couple a 0. 5 Hz sinusoidal target {{in the range of}} 50 - 100 % maximal voluntary contraction. Dynamic force output was off-line decomposed into 1) an ideal force trajectory spectrally identical to the target rate; and 2) a <b>force</b> <b>pulse</b> trace pertaining to force fluctuations and error-correction attempts. The amplitude of ideal force trajectory regarding to force-generating capacity was more suppressed than that of the <b>force</b> <b>pulse</b> trace with increasing fatigue, which also shifted the <b>force</b> <b>pulse</b> trace to lower frequency bands. Multi-scale entropy analysis revealed that the complexity of the <b>force</b> <b>pulse</b> trace at high time scales increased with fatigue, contrary to the decrease in complexity of the <b>force</b> <b>pulse</b> trace at low time scales. Statistical properties of individual force pulses in the spatial and temporal domains varied with muscular fatigue, concurrent with marked suppression of gamma muscular oscillations (40 - 60 Hz) in the post-fatigue test. In conclusion, this study first reveals that muscular fatigue impairs the amplitude modulation of force pattern generation more than it affects the amplitude responsiveness of fine-tuning a force trajectory. Besides, motor fatigue results disadvantageously in enhancement of motor noises, simplification of short-term force-tuning strategy, and slow responsiveness to force errors, pertaining to dimensional changes in force fluctuations, scaling properties of <b>force</b> <b>pulse,</b> and muscular oscillation...|$|E

40|$|SummaryDorsal closure is a tissue-modeling {{process in}} the {{developing}} Drosophila embryo during which an epidermal opening is closed. It begins {{with the appearance of}} a supracellular actin cable that surrounds the opening and provides a contractile force. Amnioserosa cells that fill the opening produce an additional critical force pulling on the surrounding epidermal tissue. We show that this force is not gradual but pulsed and occurs long before dorsal closure starts. Quantitative analysis, combined with laser cutting experiments and simulations, reveals that tension-based dynamics and cell coupling control the <b>force</b> <b>pulses.</b> These constitutively pull the surrounding epidermal tissue dorsally, but the displacement is initially transient. It is translated into dorsal-ward movement only {{with the help of the}} actin cable, which acts like a ratchet, counteracting ventral-ward epidermis relaxation after <b>force</b> <b>pulses.</b> Our work uncovers a sophisticated mechanism of cooperative force generation between two major forces driving morphogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Pulse Response Based Control (PRBC) is a {{recently}} developed minimum time control method for flexible structures. The flexible {{behavior of the}} structure is represented {{through a set of}} discrete time sequences, which are the responses of the structure due to rectangular <b>force</b> <b>pulses.</b> The rectangular <b>force</b> <b>pulses</b> are given by the actuators that control the structure.

The method was developed for driving positive semi-definite systems. In case the system is positive definite, some final states of the system may not be reachable. Necessary conditions for reachability of the final states are derived for systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom.

As no previous research has focused on cutting force in ultra-precision raster milling (UPRM), this paper presents a theoretical and experimental study on cutting force modeling in UPRM of V-groove. An analytic cutting force model is established to predict the cutting force components both in the feed direction and thrust direction, and a dynamic model is developed to simulate the free vibration signal induced by the cutting <b>force</b> <b>pulse.</b> The effects of cutting parameters in UPRM are studied, including the depth of cut and feed rate, and a group of experiments conducted to verify the simulation results. The simulation and experimental results show that cutting force in UPRM is figured as a <b>force</b> <b>pulse</b> followed by a free vibration signal induced by the <b>force</b> <b>pulse</b> and that the amplitudes of cutting force in both feed direction and thrust direction increase with the growing depth of cut and feed rate.

40|$|A central {{tenet of}} motor {{neuroscience}} {{is that the}} cerebellum learns from sensory prediction errors. Surprisingly, neuroimaging studies have not revealed definitive signatures of error processing in the cerebellum. Furthermore, neurophysiologic studies suggest an asym-metry, such that the cerebellum may encode errors arising from unexpected sensory events, but not errors reflecting the omission of expected stimuli. We conducted an imaging study to compare the cerebellar response to {{these two types of}} errors. Participantsmade fast out-and-back reachingmovements, aiming either for an object that delivered a <b>force</b> <b>pulse</b> if intersected or for a gap between two objects, either of which delivered a <b>force</b> <b>pulse</b> if intersected. Errors (missing the target) could therefore be signaled either through {{the presence or absence of}} a <b>force</b> <b>pulse.</b> In an initial analysis, the cerebellar BOLD response was smaller on trials with errors compared with trials without errors. However, we also observed an error-related decrease in heart rate. After correcting for variation in heart rate, increased activation during error trials was observed in the hand area of lobulesV andVI. This effect was similar for the two error types. The results provide evidence for the encoding of errors resulting from either the unexpected presence or unexpected absence of sensory stimulation in the human cerebellum...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} grip force and cognition in Parkinson's disease (PD), Parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy (MSAp), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and healthy controls. PD {{is characterized by}} a slower rate of force increase and decrease and the production of abnormally large grip forces. Early-stage PD has difficulty with the rapid contraction and relaxation of hand muscles required for precision gripping. The first goal was to determine which features of grip force are abnormal in MSAp and PSP. The second goal was to determine whether a single variable or a combination of motor and cognitive measures would distinguish patient groups. Since PSP is more cognitively impaired relative to PD and MSAp, we expected that combining motor and cognitive measures would further distinguish PSP from PD and MSAp. We studied 44 participants: 12 PD, 12 MSAp, 8 PSP, and 12 controls. Patients were diagnosed by a movement disorders neurologist and were tested off anti-Parkinsonian medication. Participants completed a visually guided grip force task wherein <b>force</b> <b>pulses</b> were produced for 2 s, followed by 1 s of rest. We also conducted four cognitive tests. PD, MSAp, and PSP were slower at contracting and relaxing force and produced longer pulse durations compared to controls. PSP produced additional <b>force</b> <b>pulses</b> during the task and were more cognitively impaired relative to other groups. A receiver operator characteristic analysis revealed that the combination of number of pulses and Brief Test of Attention (BTA) discriminated PSP from PD, MSAp, and controls {{with a high degree of}} sensitivity and specificity. Slowness in contracting and relaxing force represent general features of PD, MSAp, and PSP, whereas producing additional <b>force</b> <b>pulses</b> was specific to PSP. Combining motor and cognitive measures provides a robust method for characterizing behavioral features of PSP compared to MSAp and PD...|$|R

We investigated the neural correlates of scaling of force and time {{in the production of}} rhythmic motor sequences using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the human brain. Participants (N = 13) were imaged while squeezing a rigid force transducer in a near isometric manner between thumb and index finger, to reproduce four different rhythmic sequences. The responses were separated by either equal (600 ms) or alternating (400, 800 ms) intervals, and produced with either equal (12 N) or alternating (8, 16 N) <b>forces</b> <b>pulses.</b> Intervals and <b>force</b> levels were balanced across each condition. The primary motor cortex (M 1), supplementary motor area (SMA), basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum were activated during the production of sequences marked by equal interval and force.

In contrast, greater activation of these regions was associated with the extra demands of responding with alternating <b>force</b> <b>pulses.</b> We interpret the data as identifying a significant role of the BG in the control of force. In addition, the results indicate the importance of monitoring force when studying brain activation associated with motor timing...|$|R

40|$|Rapid Load Tests {{have been}} {{promoted}} {{as an alternative}} for Static Pile Load Tests since the late 1980 s. Rapid Load Tests create a relatively long duration <b>force</b> <b>pulse</b> in comparison with Dynamic Load Tests. However, a reliable prediction of pile static capacity with this test based on the so-called Unloading Point Method (UPM) has been subject to debate. Estimates of static capacity by UPM have overestimated static load test results when the applied <b>force</b> <b>pulse</b> produced too little axial movement. To resolve these issues, a drop mass Rapid Load Test called the Hybridnamic Test (HT) was developed with a ram mass up to 700 kN to reliably estimate the pile static ultimate bearing capacity up to a 35 MN. This paper discusses using a multi-cycle Hybridnamic Test in soil of mostly sand.

40|$|It {{remains unclear}} what {{information}} {{is used by}} the central nervous system (CNS) to improve performance of a movement task during training. We used a <b>force</b> <b>pulse</b> generated by a manipulandum and force applied during random catch trials to investigate how information about force is used to change feedforward movement control. Catch trials consisted of locking the manipulandum to measure isometric force. Participants experienced sets of two force pulses and were required to oppose the second pulse to minimise positional error. We investigated how prior experiences influenced feedforward commands by controlling the distribution of forces experienced {{over the course of the}} experiment. Electromyographic recordings of arm muscles were used to determine whether cocontraction was being used to minimise positional error. Forces measured on catch trials indicate that participants were unable initially to accurately oppose the <b>force</b> <b>pulse</b> and instead increased shoulder and elbow joint stiffness to minimise displacement. Force estimates were initially biased toward sensory information from the first <b>force</b> <b>pulse</b> but with practice became increasingly biased toward the mean of the distribution. Positional error decreased with practice. This suggests that with continued practice participants use sensory information about force to more accurately estimate the required force. We also showed that participants use information about their prior experience in their estimate and use this prior experience more when knowledge of the prior experience is greater and when the distribution is narrower. These results suggest that the CNS uses Bayesian models when estimating force requirements of a movement task...|$|E

Drop/impact forces may cause severe functional damage in form of component failure and/or interconnection breakage. This paper presents our investigation on the dynamic behavior of typical portable electronic devices under drop impact loading. First, an idealized system which contained an outer case and a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) with an attached packaged chip was adopted as specimen. The actual impact force pulses were measured by employing a Hopkinson bar in a dynamic test rig. Dynamic strains at several locations of the PCB were simultaneously recorded to explore the correlation between the dynamic strains and the impact <b>force</b> <b>pulse.</b> Particular attention was paid to the dependence of the dynamic response of the PCB on the impact velocity, the <b>force</b> <b>pulse,</b> as well as the impact orientation.

40|$|Previous studies {{investigating}} the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal {{in the human}} sensorimotor cortex during static force (maintained for a few seconds) and dynamic <b>force</b> (repetitive <b>force</b> <b>pulses)</b> resulted in contradictory findings. Therefore, we conducted a whole-brain {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} study during a visuomotor task requiring the production of either dynamic or static power grip force. Thereby we aimed at clarifying whether the BOLD signal behaves differently with dynamic and static force in the primary motor cortex, and whether it behaves in the same way in all areas and regions involved in force production. In the static condition, participants applied visually guided, isometric grip force on a dynamometer of 20 % maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and held this force for 21 s. In the dynamic condition, self-paced <b>force</b> <b>pulses</b> of 20 % MVC were produced at a rate of 0. 5 Hz. Static and dynamic force production activated an overlapping network of sensorimotor cortical and subcortical regions. However, the production of a significantly higher mean static force compared with the dynamic force resulted in a significantly smaller BOLD signal in the contralateral motor cortex, confirming observations of an earlier investigation. In addition, we found that the ipsilateral anterior cerebellum behaved similar to the motor cortex, whereas in all other activated regions the activation during static and dynamic force did not significantly differ. These findings demonstrate that various regions of the sensorimotor network participate differentially in the production and control of low static and dynamic grip force, and raise important questions concerning the interpretation of the BOLD signal with respect to mechanisms of neurovascular coupling...|$|R
