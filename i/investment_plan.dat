5|$|The Port of Ploče {{recorded}} a steady {{growth and development}} from 1945, but suffered a sharp decline between 1991 and 1996 due to the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War. In the late 2000s, Luka Ploče d.d., the primary concessionaire of the Port of Ploče, embarked on an ambitious <b>investment</b> <b>plan,</b> aiming for {{a substantial increase in}} the volume of port operations. Funding was secured in 2007, and Luka Ploče d.d. plans to invest €91million in port infrastructure and around €180million in port equipment by 2014.|$|E
5|$|As of 2011, {{the port}} {{ranks as the}} largest {{passenger}} port in Croatia and the third largest passenger port in the Mediterranean, with annual passenger volume of approximately 4million. By 2010, the Port of Split recorded 18,000 ship arrivals each year. The port is managed by the Port of Split Authority (PSA). In the late 2000s, the PSA and the port operators, Trajektna Luka Split d.d. and Luka d.d. Split, started to implement an <b>investment</b> <b>plan</b> aimed at increasing both passenger and cargo traffic volume, scheduled {{to be completed by}} 2015, which would allow the port to handle up to 7million passengers per year.|$|E
5|$|In around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, a three-arched bridge spanning the River Avon. He used as his prototype an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Adam also submitted {{plans for the}} new Assembly Rooms but these were rejected as too costly. John Wood, the Younger raised funding {{for the construction of}} the Assembly Rooms by the use of a Tontine, an <b>investment</b> <b>plan</b> that is named after the Neapolitan banker Lorenzo de Tonti, who is credited with inventing it in France in 1653. It combines features of a group annuity and a lottery. Each subscriber pays an agreed sum into the fund, and thereafter receives an annuity. As members die, their shares devolve to the other participants, and so the value of each annuity increases. On the death of the last member, the scheme is wound up. Construction started in 1769 and was completed in 1771, when a grand opening was held.|$|E
40|$|<b>Investment</b> <b>planning</b> (as {{one of the}} key {{components}} of financial planning) is seen as an important solution to investment problems and challenges. Previous research however indicated that compare to men, women are not as confident and knowledgeable about financial and investment matters. As a result, women do not conduct <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> until it is often too late and when they are confronted with a financial crisis or a life predicament such as a divorce or death. Given the lack of research attention focusing on women‟s perceptions of financial and <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> in South Africa, and in particular the Eastern Cape, the objective of this research is to investigate the factors that influence women‟s Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> in the Nelson Mandela Bay area. After conducting a comprehensive literature study, seven factors (independent variables) namely Values, Attitudes, Time horizon, Personal life cycle, Risks and Returns, Investment Knowledge, were identified as influencing the Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> (dependent variable) of women. Various hypotheses were formulated to be tested in the empirical investigation. The validity and reliability of the measuring instrument were tested among 207 respondents. The Exploratory Factor Analysis, as well as the Cronbach‟s alpha coeffient analysis, revelead that Investment knowledge, Personal life cycle and Values are important factors that influence the women‟s Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning.</b> As a result of these analyses, the hypotheses had to be reformulated. In order to establish whether correlations existed between the various factors investigated in this study, Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficients were calculated. Positive correlations were found between all the variables, except between Values and Personal life cycle and between Values and Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning.</b> To analyse the association in which the effects of the independent variables (Investment knowledge, Personal life cycle and Values) have on the dependent variable (Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning)</b> of this study, multiple regression analysis was conducted. Only one independent variable emerged as having a significant influence on Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> of women, namely Investment knowledge. In order to investigate the influence of the various demographic variables on the dependent variable, an Analysis of Variance was performed. No {{significant differences were found between}} the selected demographic variables, namely Age, Ethnic group, Marital status, Education and Investment experience and the independent variables or dependent variable of this study. By investigating the influence of women‟s Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning,</b> this study has added to the body of knowledge of both financial and <b>investment</b> <b>planning.</b> Based on the empirical results of this study, several recommendations have been made in an attempt to assist women to make better investment decisions and manage their <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> more effectively...|$|R

5|$|The theatre {{was erected}} in 1805, {{replacing}} the Old Orchard Street Theatre which had obtained a royal patent in 1768 enabling {{the use of}} the title 'Theatre Royal', the first to achieve this outside London. The Orchard Street site became a church and is now a Freemason's Hall. The new theatre was first proposed in 1802 at several sites in Bath until the current site was chosen in 1804; funding was raised by the use of a Tontine, an <b>investment</b> <b>plan</b> named after the Neapolitan banker Lorenzo de Tonti, who is credited with inventing it in France in 1653. It combined features of a group annuity and a lottery. Each subscriber paid an agreed sum into the fund, and thereafter received an annuity. As members died, their shares devolved to the other participants, and so the value of each annuity increased. On the death of the last member, the scheme was wound up. Shares, which cost £200, were rapidly purchased, with the Prince Regent who later became George IV and his brother Prince Frederick among the subscribers. A similar scheme had previously been used for the construction of the Bath Assembly Rooms.|$|E

40|$|This Paper {{shows how}} microeconomic data on <b>investment</b> <b>plans</b> {{can be used}} to study the {{structure}} of risk faced by firms. Revisions of <b>investment</b> <b>plans</b> form a martingale, and thus reveal the underlying shocks driving investment. We decompose revisions in <b>investment</b> <b>plans</b> into micro, sector and aggregate shocks, and exploit stock market data to distinguish between structural (value-related) shocks and measurement error in investment revisions. Using panel data for US firms, we find that micro shocks are not the dominant source of risk in investment decisions, and that much of the observed micro variation is actually due to heterogeneity in firm-level responses to aggregate shocks. Firms are able to diversify most idiosyncratic investment risk, and they {{do not appear to be}} liquidity-constrained. aggregate shocks; heterogeneity; investment; micro shocks...|$|R
