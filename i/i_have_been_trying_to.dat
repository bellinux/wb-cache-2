500|$|When McCartney was a child, {{his mother}} read him poems and {{encouraged}} him to read books. His father invited Paul and his brother Michael to solve crosswords with him, to increase their [...] "word power", as McCartney said. In 2001, McCartney published Blackbird Singing, a volume of poems and lyrics to his songs for which he gave readings in Liverpool and New York City. In the foreword of the book, he explains: [...] "When I was a teenager... I had an overwhelming desire to have a poem published in the school magazine. I wrote something deep and meaningful—which was promptly rejected—and I suppose <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get my own back ever since". His first children's book was published by Faber & Faber in 2005, , a collaboration with writer Philip Ardagh and animator Geoff Dunbar. Featuring a squirrel whose woodland home is razed by developers, it had been scripted and sketched by McCartney and Dunbar over several years, as an animated film. The Observer labelled it an [...] "anti-capitalist children's book".|$|E
2500|$|I did {{it because}} I had a grudge against him. He {{deserved}} it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> wreak vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of death. I am dying for my country. I have seen my people starving in India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my duty.

2500|$|Nogradi won the Janikovszky-Eva {{award in}} 2003, {{but he has}} never {{received}} any national awards. As he says, [...] "They look at me as an outsider, {{because the people who}} give the awards in our country do not fully understand what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> accomplish with my work and my projects. Fortunately, my readers, the children (and their parents) do, so as long as they love and read my books, I am happy. As a famous Hungarian poet, Sandor Weöres, once said, a writer, if he is any good, must live a sort of life that the powers that be do not even consider him for an award.... I agree." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ericksen {{enrolled}} in University of Washington {{and was able}} to obtain his bachelor's degree in a year due to credits accumulated in his Navy training. He was a mathematics major and had a minor in Naval Science. His first graduate school was Oregon State where he had Howard Eves as an advisor. Ericksen went on to Indiana University seeking to find applications, besides teaching, for his mathematical skill. There he came under the influence of David Gilbarg, Vaclav Hlavaty, Eberhard Hopf, and Max Zorn. Other influences included Bill Gustin, Tracy Thomas, and George Whaples. Most significantly, it was in Bloomington that he began to work with Clifford Truesdell who was criticizing continuum theories. In his autobiography of 2005, Ericksen says [...] "since then <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> better understand the formulation of and techniques for exploring continuum theories." [...] Ericksen obtained his Ph.D. in 1951. Jerald and Marion began their family with daughter Lynn in Bloomington.|$|E
2500|$|Gandhi's {{advocacy}} for women's rights began with her help {{in establishing the}} Congress Party's Women's Section. In 1956, she wrote in a letter: [...] "It is because of this that I am taking a much more active part in politics. I {{have to do a}} great deal of touring in order to set up the Congress Party Women's Section, and am on numerous important committees." [...] Gandhi {{spent a great deal of}} time throughout the 1950s helping organize women. She wrote to Norman in 1959, irritable that women had organized around the communist cause but had not mobilized for the Indian cause: [...] "The women, whom <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> organize for years, had always refused to come into politics. Now they are out in the field." [...] Once appointed president in 1959, she [...] "travelled relentlessly, visiting remote parts of the country that had never before received a VIP...she talked to women, asked about child health and welfare, inquired after the crafts of the region" [...] Gandhi's actions throughout her ascent to power clearly reflect a desire to mobilize women. Gandhi did not see the purpose of feminism. Gandhi saw her own success as a woman, and also noted that [...] "Given the opportunity to develop, capable Indian women have come to the top at once." ...|$|E
