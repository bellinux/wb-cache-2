30|$|Inspection of the {{moisture}} content (MC) in dried lumber {{is essential for}} wood industry to ensure dimensional stability in service. Several types of commercial <b>moisture</b> <b>meters</b> authorized by Japan Housing and Wood Technology Center (HOWTEC) (e.g. resistance-type, capacitance-type, microwave and neutron <b>moisture</b> <b>meters)</b> {{have been used to}} check MC of lumber in sawmills. These <b>moisture</b> <b>meters</b> are designed to perform a calibration based on wood density, because density has a significant influence on MC readings obtained with these <b>moisture</b> <b>meters</b> [1]. For instance, Milota [2] used a capacitance-type <b>moisture</b> <b>meter</b> to measure MC of samples of eight species conditioned sequentially at 22, 18, 12 and 8  % equilibrium MC, and demonstrated that the performance of the <b>moisture</b> <b>meter</b> could be improved by density calibration. Using a permeable neutron <b>moisture</b> <b>meter,</b> Moriya et al. [3] recently examined the effect of density on thermal neutron by which the MC of lumber is measured, and concluded that density calibration is critical for MC measurement with high accuracy. It is, however, difficult to measure the density of each lumber in sawmills, because density determination is traditionally done by a volumetric method that is accurate but destructive and time consuming. As a consequence, a commercial <b>moisture</b> <b>meter</b> is calibrated approximately by setting known, constant density values to each species, resulting in an error in MC reading. Thus, a method for swiftly and non-destructively measuring the density of lumber is being required.|$|R

40|$|Soil cation {{exchange}} capacity (CEC) depends on the extent and negative charge density of surfaces of soil mineral and organic components. Soil water sorption also depends {{on the extent of}} such surfaces, giving thus way to significant relationships between CEC and <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>moisture</b> (HM) in many soils. In this work, we explored whether CEC could be accurately predicted from HM in agricultural soils of Mediterranean and humid temperate areas in Western Europe. For this purpose, we examined 243 soils across a wide variation range of their intrinsic properties. Soil CEC was determined using 1 M ammonium acetate at pH 7 and HM at an equilibrium air relative humidity (RH) of 43 % (HM 43). Most of the variation of soil CEC was explained by HM 43 through a linear function (CEC = 1. 4 + 0. 78 HM 43; R 2 = 0. 962; standard deviation = 2. 30 cmol c /kg).

40|$|ABSTRACT:- Moisture {{content of}} grain {{is one of}} the {{important}} parameters always considered when deciding the quality and price of grain, at the stage of harvesting, storage, processing and marketing. Grain having excess moisture content, if stored for long duration, will spoil due to insect/fungus infestation.

The types of Grain <b>Moisture</b> <b>Meters</b> available in the market are with look-up tables, which cause inconvenience when carrying out measurements. We have developed a grain <b>moisture</b> <b>meter,</b> which due to its novel design, eliminates this problem and gives moisture (%) directly on a LCD display. The novelty of this instrument is that it is compact, easy-to-use, portable, and field usable. The <b>moisture</b> <b>meter</b> is based on the principle of dielectric constant variations due to change in moisture. Changes of moisture content affect the dielectric constant of the grain, which in turn makes variation in capacitance. The resultant capacitance variation is converted to voltage variation and calibrated in terms of moisture percentage. On the basis of rigorous experiments the meter has been calibrated for wheat, paddy, soybean, sunflower & mustard. However, the user can calibrate the meter at his level for other grains also. The developed instrument is working satisfactorily for all practical purposes in the range of 5 - 25 % of grain moisture with an accuracy of ± 1 %...|$|R
