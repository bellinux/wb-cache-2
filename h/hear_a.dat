5|$|It was {{the grandest}} sight I ever experienced, {{to look out}} of the {{lighthouse}} on a very stormy day, and see oneself hanging, as it were, over the ocean, surrounded on three sides by a fearful chasm in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce {{the appearance of a}} heavy snowstorm, whilst the cries of these myriads, mingled with the roar of the ocean and the howling of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a blast pipe, made it almost impossible to <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> person speak.|$|E

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Trenyce said that the audience was initially hesitant to <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> woman interpret Jackson's music. Theatreworld's Geoff Billingsley praised Trenyce's performance, writing that her voice sounded very similar to Jackson's and describing her as an improvement over the previous female lead Cleo Higgins.|$|E

5|$|Peers help expose {{children}} to multi-party conversations. This allows {{children to}} <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> {{greater variety of}} speech, and to observe different conversational roles.

Speaking to peers is different from speaking to adults, but children may still correct their peers. Peer interaction provides children with a different experience filled with special humour, disagreements and conversational topics.|$|E

5|$|Persona 2: Eternal Punishment is a {{role-playing}} {{game where}} the player takes {{control of a}} group of characters exploring the fictional city of Sumaru. The camera follows the party from an adjustable angled overhead perspective. The city in general is navigated using an overworld map. A key element to the story and gameplay is the Rumor system: after the characters <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> rumor, they can spread that rumor around the city using certain characters, and those rumors can grant the characters special items or other positive or negative effects.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E
5|$|After Bamber telephoned the police, a British Telecom {{operator}} {{checked the}} White House Farm line—at 3:56am {{according to the}} police log and at 4:30 am according to the Court of Appeal—and found that the line was open. The operator could <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> dog barking. According to British Telecom, if Nevill had telephoned Bamber without replacing the receiver, the line between them would have remained open for between eight and 16 minutes. Bamber would therefore {{not have been able to}} use his telephone to report the call to the police immediately, as he said he did in one statement; in another statement he said he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London. That the line would not have cleared is one of several disputed points.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} main {{categories}} {{into which the}} hearing of talking voices often fall: <b>a</b> person <b>hearing</b> <b>a</b> voice speak one's thoughts, <b>a</b> person <b>hearing</b> one or more voices arguing, or <b>a</b> person <b>hearing</b> <b>a</b> voice narrating his/her own actions.

5|$|At 3 a.m. about 120 {{bank and}} trust company {{officials}} assembled to <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> full {{report on the}} status of the failing trust companies. While the Trust Company of America was barely solvent, the Lincoln Trust Company was probably $1 million short of what it needed to cover depositor accounts. As discussion ensued, the bankers realized that Morgan had locked them in the library and pocketed the key to force a solution, the sort of strong-arm tactic he had been known to use in the past. Morgan then entered the talks and advised the trust companies they must provide a loan of $25 million to save the weaker institutions. The trust presidents were still reluctant to act, but Morgan informed them that if they did not it would lead to a complete collapse of the banking system. Through his considerable influence, at about 4:45a.m. he persuaded the unofficial leader of the trust companies to sign the agreement, and the remainder of the bankers followed. Having received these commitments, Morgan allowed the bankers to go home.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman {{system of}} direct democracy, two primary types of gatherings {{were used to}} vote on legislative, electoral, and {{judicial}} matters. The first was the Assembly (comitia), which was a gathering that was deemed to represent the entire Roman people, {{even if it did}} not contain all of the Roman citizens or, like the comitia curiata, excluded a particular class of Roman citizens (the plebs). The second was the Council (concilium), which was a gathering of citizens of a specific class. In contrast, the Convention was an unofficial forum for communication. Conventions were simply forums where Romans met for specific unofficial purposes, such as, for example, to <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> political speech. Voters always assembled first into Conventions to hear debates and conduct other business before voting, and then into Assemblies or Councils to actually vote.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} as a girl named Sally and her unnamed brother, who serves as the narrator of the book, sit alone in their house on a cold, rainy day, staring wistfully out the window. Then they <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> loud bump which is quickly {{followed}} {{by the arrival of}} the Cat in the Hat, a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows. The children's pet fish refuses, insisting that the Cat leave. The Cat responds by balancing the fish on the tip of his umbrella. The game quickly becomes more complicated, as the Cat balances himself on a ball and tries to balance lots of household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything he was holding. The fish admonishes him again, but the Cat in the Hat just proposes another game.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} {{immediately}} after the events of Sonic 3, where Dr. Robotnik's orbital weapon, the Death Egg, is damaged in a battle with Sonic and crash-lands back onto Angel Island. Sonic travels through each zone looking to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds to defeat Robotnik, and once again comes into conflict with Knuckles, who believes Sonic is trying to steal the Emeralds for himself. In Hidden Palace Zone, Sonic fights and defeats Knuckles. The two <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> disturbance outside of the chamber, and go out to find Dr. Robotnik stealing the Master Emerald, the secret to the island's levitation powers. Knuckles attempts to attack Robotnik, but is electrically shocked in the process, and is trapped with Sonic in an underground passage. Knuckles, realizing Sonic is on his side, shows him a portal that leads them to Sky Sanctuary, where the Death Egg is relaunching. Sonic proceeds to infiltrate the Death Egg, and defeats Robotnik as Super Sonic.|$|E
5|$|Three {{months have}} passed since Tom Mason (Noah Wyle) boarded the spacecraft, and the 2nd Mass {{has been on the}} move. In the opening scene, a small group, part of the 2nd Mass, led by Captain Weaver (Will Patton), attack a group of Skitters and Mechs patrolling the streets. Ben Mason (Connor Jessup), who was {{captured}} by the Skitters months earlier, has since grown to despise the extra terrestrials. Weaver orders the group to cease fire and conserve ammo. Ben, however, notices a Skitter still alive. He jumps from the rooftop on which he was firing and slits the Skitter's throat. His brother, Hal (Drew Roy), follows him. They both <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> noise and notice another Skitter. Ben shoots it. However, at that point, Tom Mason was wrestling with it. The bullet goes through the Skitter and wounds Tom.|$|E
