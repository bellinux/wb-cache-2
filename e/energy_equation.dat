5|$|A {{number of}} {{initiatives}} {{are working to}} reduce costs of electric power from offshore wind. One example is the Carbon Trust Offshore Wind Accelerator, a joint industry project, involving nine offshore wind developers, which aims {{to reduce the cost}} of offshore wind by 10% by 2015. It has been suggested that innovation at scale could deliver 25% cost reduction in offshore wind by 2020. Henrik Stiesdal, former Chief Technical Officer at Siemens Wind Power, has stated that by 2025 energy from offshore wind {{will be one of the}} cheapest, scalable solutions in the UK, compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources, if the true cost to society is factored into the cost of <b>energy</b> <b>equation.</b> He calculates the cost at that time to be 43 EUR/MWh for onshore, and 72 EUR/MWh for offshore wind.|$|E

25|$|The {{basic idea}} is that the overall binding free energy can be {{decomposed}} into independent components that are known to be important for the binding process. Each component reflects a certain kind of free energy alteration during the binding process between a ligand and its target receptor. The Master Equation is the linear combination of these components. According to Gibbs free <b>energy</b> <b>equation,</b> the relation between dissociation equilibrium constant, Kd, and the components of free energy was built.|$|E
25|$|As {{the fluid}} enters and {{leaves in the}} axial direction, the {{centrifugal}} component in the <b>energy</b> <b>equation</b> does not come into play. Here the compression is fully based on diffusing action of the passages.The diffusing action in stator converts absolute kinetic head of the fluid into rise in pressure. The relative kinetic head in the <b>energy</b> <b>equation</b> is a term that exists {{only because of the}} rotation of the rotor. The rotor reduces the relative kinetic head of the fluid and adds it to the absolute kinetic head of the fluid i.e., the impact of the rotor on the fluid particles increases its velocity (absolute) and thereby reduces the relative velocity between the fluid and the rotor. In short, the rotor increases the absolute velocity of the fluid and the stator converts this into pressure rise. Designing the rotor passage with a diffusing capability can produce a pressure rise in addition to its normal functioning. This produces greater pressure rise per stage which constitutes a stator and a rotor together. This is the reaction principle in turbomachines. If 50% of the pressure rise in a stage is obtained at the rotor section, it is said to have a 50% reaction.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{cracking}} was {{the first}} category of hydrocarbon cracking to be developed. Thermal cracking {{is an example of}} a reaction whose energetics are dominated by entropy (∆S°) rather than by enthalpy (∆H°) in the Gibbs Free <b>Energy</b> <b>equation</b> ∆G°=∆H°-T∆S°. Although the bond dissociation energy D for a carbon-carbon single bond is relatively high (about 375 kJ/mol) and cracking is highly endothermic, the large positive entropy change resulting from the fragmentation of one large molecule into several smaller pieces, together with the extremely high temperature, makes T∆S° term larger than the ∆H° term, thereby favoring the cracking reaction.|$|E

In multiphysics simulations, the energy diffusion and exchanging process is coupled with some other physical processes, such as fluid dynamics, laser broadcast etc. Consequently, the 3 -T <b>energy</b> <b>equations</b> should be discretized on the deforming meshes which is moved with dynamics. On deforming meshes, some nine-point scheme must be employed to discretize 3 -T <b>energy</b> <b>equations</b> for two dimensional case. Because the energy diffusion and swapping coefficients have a strongly nonlinear dependence on the temperature, and some physical parameters are discontinuous across the materials interfaces, it is a challenge to solve the discretized nonlinear algebraic equations on multiple materials and multiple physics applications [1].
