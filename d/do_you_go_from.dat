5000|$|While critics often praised The West Wing for its writing, others faulted {{the show}} as unrealistically optimistic and sentimental.

The album was a daring move for Wilde, who wanted to make something to please herself first and foremost.

5000|$|In 939, {{fearing that}} An Chongrong the {{military}} governor of Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) would rebel, Shi moved An's potential ally Huangfu Yu (皇甫遇) the military {{governor of the}} neighboring Yiwu Circuit (義武, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei) to Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered at Lu Prefecture). Emperor Taizong tried to use this opportunity to inject himself into the commissioning of Yiwu's military governor, proposing that the Liao official Wang Wei (王威), whose father Wang Chuzhi had previously ruled Yiwu in alliance with Later Tang's predecessor state Jin, be made Yiwu's military governor. When Shi refused (based on the rationale that Wang needed to go through several layers of promotions to qualify (from prefect to military prefect to defender to military governor), Emperor Taizong sent back the angry response of, [...] "How many layers of promotion <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> through <b>from</b> being military governor to be the Son of Heaven?" [...] Shi, in fear, sent a rich tribute and promised to make Wang Chuzhi's grandnephew Wang Tingyin (王廷胤) Yiwu's military governor. That somewhat placated Emperor Taizong.|$|R
5000|$|Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán {{wrote in}} the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: [...] "Europe's {{response}} is madness. We must acknowledge that the European Union's misguided immigration policy is responsible for this situation". Orbán also demanded an official EU list of [...] "safe countries" [...] to which migrants can be returned. He said that [...] "the moral, human thing is to make clear: ‘Please don’t come. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> have to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> Turkey to Europe? Turkey is a safe country. Stay there. It’s risky to come’." [...] Hungary has adopted a list of countries deemed safe for transiting purposes. If an asylum seeker has passed through those countries, {{it is assumed that}} he could have found asylum there, and therefore he is not eligible for asylum in Hungary. Speaking at United Nations General Assembly, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán called for [...] "global quota" [...] system to distribute refugees to all countries.|$|R

5000|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} episode, Television Without Pity also gave this one a A+ for returning to its first season roots: [...] "I rarely think about it when I give the A+, because I basically always give the A+, because I think quantifying art is, if not impossible, at the most subjective {{to a sort of}} horrifying degree. At what point <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> [...] "I liked it" [...] to [...] "it was good"? I don't trust myself to be accurate about that; I feel like it's enough to enjoy the ride they're putting me on as much as possible and getting as much out of it as I can. That way, the burden's on them. Having said that? Best episode in {{the last year and a}} half, possibly best altogether since the first season." ...|$|E
5000|$|Like “Mexican Home” on his {{previous}} album, “He Was in Heaven Before He Died” was partially inspired by Prine’s father, {{who died in}} 1971, and Prine later reflected on the song’s opening line about “a rainbow of babies draped over the graveyard”: “Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> there? I consider it a challenge, thought, to paint myself into a corner and then get out.” The musical arrangements were more complex {{than they had been}} in the past, with Prine biographer Eddie Huffman noting that [...] "Common Sense" [...] used the common I-IV-V chord progression, though Prine [...] "mixed it up with extra chords, as usual, stretching the music to fit the lyrics," [...] while [...] "Saddle in the Rain" [...] "kept his sidemen on their toes, seeming to modulate between D and E minor," [...] and [...] "That Close to You" [...] shifted from A to D in the bridge like a middle-period Beatles song.|$|E
50|$|However, {{after its}} {{official}} release in 2009, vocalist/guitarist Mark Hamilton stated that:I consider Treasury Library Canada a proper record {{in its own}} right these days, given the reaction it’s received. Although, admittedly, when it was first released in our own self-pressed edition, that sold out in just a few weeks, I thought we were destined to print up 1000 of the things and then have 800 in my closet for the rest of time. As an album, I think its creation, however, is a little strange. The majority of the songs were either tunes written for Songbook and not used (otherwise I’d have made a double debut record, and where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> there?), or songs written while struggling with the recording and mixing of Songbook, so it almost felt like a sideline commentary on that for a while. In reflection, though, I think it’s actually brought a bit more awareness to the songs that are on it, because I largely didn’t think people would really be listening to these things. Thus the name Treasury Library Canada and the idea of pulling down some books from your childhood that you’d never even read then, and realizing how amazing they are.|$|E

5000|$|End of Fashion's third studio album Holiday Trip of a Lifetime was {{released}} on 4 May 2012. The album was independently produced and released, with the band writing the album over the period of one year. However, the band members parted ways following the album's release, and Burford's focus shifted towards acting and solo music work. Burford attracted media attention in January 2014 when he identified Triple J as {{the primary reason for}} the band's demise, explaining: [...] "'The question becomes, when your entire fan base is tied up in a radio station and that station decides to no longer broadcast your output or even barely acknowledge your existence, where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> there?'" [...] Burford's perspective, initially published in a Facebook post, followed criticism of the radio station from other musicians and an article published by the Age newspaper, in which the journalist addressed the issue of whether Triple J has led to the [...] "homogenisation of Australian music". In an interview in 2013 Burford stated that the band hadn't broken up but was in hiatus, [...] "We've never had the chat where we have said 'Let's call it a day', It's just that everybody has fallen into other rhythms of life." ...|$|E
5000|$|In May 2007, {{prior to}} the release of The Bourne Ultimatum, Matt Damon stated {{that he would not be}} {{interested}} in returning for a fourth Bourne film, remarking of his participation in the Bourne franchise: [...] "We have ridden that horse as far as we can." [...] Damon said in August 2007: I think in terms of another one, the story of this guy's search for his identity is over, because he's got all the answers, so there's no way we can trot out the same character, and so much of what makes him interesting is that internal struggle that was happening for him: am I a good guy, am I a bad guy, what is the secret behind my identity, what am I blocking out, why am I remembering these disturbing images? So all of that internal propulsive mechanism that drives the character is not there, so if there was to be another one, then it would have to be a complete reconfiguration, you know. Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> there? For me, I kind of feel like the story that we set out to tell has now been told. I love the character, and if Paul Greengrass calls me in ten years and says, 'Now we can do it, because it's been ten years and I have a way to bring him back,' then there's a world in which I can go, 'Yeah, absolutely.' We could get the band back together if there was a great idea behind it, but in terms of now and this story, that part—-the story's been told...|$|E
