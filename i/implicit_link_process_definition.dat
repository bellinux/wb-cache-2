40|$|During {{the last}} decade a variety of {{information}} technologies have emerged relating to business process modelling. One issue resulting from the introduction of these technologies is the inability to <b>link</b> the business <b>process</b> <b>definition</b> with the information gathered during {{the development of the}} business strategy. Organisations require the ability to define their business strategy, then use the outcomes of this definition to drive the business <b>process</b> <b>definition.</b> This paper details a methodology that applies XML to link business strategy with business <b>process</b> <b>definition.</b> The key contribution of this work is an extension to the Balanced Scorecard XML draft standard that incorporates quantified business process performance measures. This methodology is then applied to a specific case study where an organisation plans to provide personal loans to its customers...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that Web-page {{classification}} can be enhanced by using hyperlinks that provide linkages between Web pages. However, in the Web space, hyperlinks are usually sparse, noisy and thus in many situations can only provide limited help in classification. In this paper, we extend the concept of linkages from explicit hyperlinks to <b>implicit</b> <b>links</b> built between Web pages. By observing that people who search the Web with the same queries often click on di#erent, but related documents together, we draw <b>implicit</b> <b>links</b> between Web pages that are clicked after the same queries. Those pages are implicitly linked. We provide an approach for automatically building the <b>implicit</b> <b>links</b> between Web pages using Web query logs, together with a thorough comparison between the uses of <b>implicit</b> and explicit <b>links</b> in Web page classification. Our experimental results on a large dataset confirm that the use of the <b>implicit</b> <b>links</b> is better than using explicit links in classification performance, with an increase of more than 10. 5 % in terms of the Macro-F 1 measurement...|$|R
50|$|In {{distributed}} systems, {{sometimes there}} are <b>implicit</b> <b>links,</b> which are not specified during execution. For example, an <b>implicit</b> <b>link</b> exists between an actor that wrote to a file and another actor that read from it. Such links connect actors which use a common data set for execution. The dataset is {{the output of the}} first actor and is the input of the actor following it.|$|R
40|$|Social {{bookmarks}} allow Web {{users to}} actively annotate individual Web resources. Researchers are exploring {{the use of}} these annotations to create <b>implicit</b> <b>links</b> between online resources. We define an <b>implicit</b> <b>link</b> as a relationship between two online resources established by the Web community. An individual may create or reinforce a relationship between two resources by applying a common tag or organizing them in a common folder. This has led to the exploration of techniques for building networks of resources, categories, and people using the social annotations. In order for these techniques to move from the lab to the real world, efficient building and maintenance of these potentially large networks remains a major obstacle. Methods for assembling and indexing these large networks will allow researchers to run more rigorous assessments of their proposed techniques. Toward this goal we explore an approach from the sparse matrix literature and apply it to our system, GiveALink. org. We also investigate distributing the assembly, allowing us to grow the network with the body of resources, annotations, and users. Dividing the network is effective for assembling a global network where the <b>implicit</b> <b>links</b> are dependent on global properties. Additionally, we explore alternative <b>implicit</b> <b>link</b> measures that remove global dependencies and thus allow for the global network to be assembled incrementally, as each participant makes independent contributions. Finally we evaluate three scalable similarity measures, two of which require a revision of the data model underlying our social annotations. ∗ Corresponding author...|$|R

40|$|A key {{promise of}} process {{languages}} based on open standards, {{such as the}} Web Services Business Process Execution Language, is the avoidance of vendor lock-in through the portability of <b>process</b> <b>definitions</b> among runtime environments. Despite the fact that today, various runtimes claim to support this language, every runtime implements a different subset, thus hampering portability and locking in their users. In this paper, we intend to improve this situation by enabling the measurement {{of the degree of}} portability of <b>process</b> <b>definitions.</b> This helps developers to assess their <b>process</b> <b>definitions</b> and to decide if it is feasible to invest in the effort of porting a <b>process</b> <b>definition</b> to another runtime.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we design}} a local {{classification}} algorithm using <b>implicit</b> <b>link</b> analysis, considering {{the situation that}} the labeled and unlabeled data are drawn from two different albeit related domains. In contrast to many global classifiers, e. g. Support Vector Machines, our local classifier only {{takes into account the}} neighborhood information around unlabeled data points, and is hardly based on the global distribution in the data set. Thus, the local classifier has good abilities to tackle the non-i. i. d. classification problem since its generalization will not degrade by the bias w. r. t. each unlabeled data point. We build a local neighborhood by connecting the similar data points. Based on these <b>implicit</b> <b>links,</b> the Relaxation Labeling technique is employed. In this work, we theoretically and empirically analyze our algorithm, and show how our algorithm improves the traditional classifiers. It turned out that our algorithm greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised algorithms when classifying documents across different domains. ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{requirements}} {{for a business}} process depend on the entire workflow environment that includes common data for all the population of processes, state of resources, state of processes, etc. The natural way to specify and implement such requirements is to put them into the <b>process</b> <b>definition.</b> In order to do it, we need: (1) a generalised workflow meta-model that includes data on the workflow environment, <b>process</b> <b>definitions,</b> and {{the current state of}} execution of all processes; (2) a powerful and flexible query language addressing the meta-model; (3) integration of a query language with a business <b>process</b> <b>definition</b> language. In this paper the mentioned workflow meta-model together with the business process query language BPQL is presented. BPQL may be integrated with the XML <b>Process</b> <b>Definition</b> Language (XPDL) increasing significantly its expressiveness and flexibility.

This paper {{describes}} {{our experiences}} {{in defining the}} processes asso-ciated with preparing and administrating chemotherapy and then using those <b>process</b> <b>definitions</b> {{as the basis for}} analyses aimed at finding and correcting de-fects. The work is a collaboration between medical professionals from a major regional cancer center and computer science researchers.

The paper de-scribes how these technologies were applied to successfully identify defects in the chemotherapy process. Although this work is still ongoing, early experi-ences suggest that this approach can help reduce medical errors and improve patient safety.
