25|$|The pushing power (thrust) of {{the horse}} is called <b>impulsion,</b> and is the fourth level of the {{training}} pyramid. <b>Impulsion</b> is created by storing the energy of engagement (the forward reaching of the hind legs under the body).|$|E
25|$|<b>Impulsion</b> {{can occur}} at the walk, trot and canter. It is highly {{important}} to establish good, forward movement and <b>impulsion</b> at the walk, as achieving desirable form in the trot and canter relies heavily on {{the transition from a}} good, supple, forward walk.|$|E

25|$|When {{working on}} {{straightness}} in the horse, a common exercise is used called 'shoulder in'. The exercise {{is the beginning}} of straightness in the horse as well as collection and can increase <b>impulsion</b> in the horse.|$|E
25|$|<b>Impulsion</b> {{not only}} {{encourages}} correct muscle and joint use, but also engages {{the mind of}} the horse, focusing it on the rider and, particularly at the walk and trot, allowing for relaxation and dissipation of nervous energy.|$|E
25|$|The {{lengthened}} canter {{results in}} a longer frame from the horse, with a larger stride. The horse should still maintain <b>impulsion,</b> and care should be taken {{that it is not}} driven forward onto the forehand. Rhythm and tempo stay the same.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{provides}} computation-oriented {{necessary and}} sufficient {{conditions for the}} global exponential stability of linear systems with asynchronous sensors and actuators. Precisely, we focus on continuous-time linear systems whose state undergoes finite jumps referred to as <b>impulsions.</b> The <b>impulsions</b> are of two types: those related to input updates and those related to measurement updates. We assume that <b>impulsions</b> of each type occur periodically but the periods may be different and the clocks at the sensor and at the actuator are not synchronized. We first show that the analysis {{can be reduced to}} a finite time domain. Based on that, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the global exponential stability of systems belonging to the class under study.

25|$|In {{addition}} to marks for the dressage movements, marks are also awarded for more general attributes {{such as the}} horse's gaits, submission, <b>impulsion</b> and the rider’s performance. Some segments are given increased weight {{by the use of}} a multiplier, or coefficient. Coefficients are typically given a value of 2, which then doubles the marks given for that segment. Movements that are given a coefficient are generally considered to be particularly important to the horse's progression in training, and should be competently executed prior to moving up to the next level of competition. The scores for the general attributes of gait, submission, <b>impulsion,</b> and rider performance mentioned above are scored using a coefficient.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{investigated}} which categories of obsessive-compulsive and Tourette-related behaviors in Gilles de la Tourette's disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) without tics are experienced as most severe across the study groups {{and what the}} differences are in symptom distribution between the study groups. METHOD: Fourteen subjects with both Tourette's disorder and OCD, 18 subjects with Tourette's only, 21 subjects with OCD (no tics), and 29 control subjects were studied using a semistructured interview designed to equally assess Tourette- and OCD-related behaviors according to DSM-III-R criteria. Each reported repetitive behavior was evaluated {{on the presence of}} anxiety and on goal-directedness. Anxiety-related items were categorized as obsessions or compulsions and non-anxiety-related items as <b>impulsions.</b> Severity of each reported item was assessed with respect to time per day consumed and amount of distress and interference induced by the item. Following these criteria, each reported item was classified as a symptom, a subthreshold symptom, or just as being present. RESULTS: Across the study groups, obsessions were experienced as more severe than (Tourette-related) <b>impulsions</b> and compulsions. Within the study groups, patients with both Tourette's disorder and OCD reported more symptomatic Tourette-related <b>impulsions,</b> such as mental play, echophenomena, and impulsive or self-injurious behaviors; less overall symptomatic obsessions; and less symptomatic washing than patients with OCD (no tics). The differences among individuals with Tourette's with or without OCD reflected differences in symptom severity rather than differences in symptom distribution. CONCLUSION: Obsessions are more time consuming, distressing, and interfering than compulsions and <b>impulsions.</b> Furthermore, the symptomatic repetitive behaviors were distributed differently among patients with both Tourette's disorder and OCD and patients with OCD (no tics). Patients with Tourette's and OCD are phenomenologically more similar to Tourette's than to OCD. These differences possibly represent differences in underlying pathophysiology between Tourette's and tic-free OCD...|$|R

25|$|When {{the horse}} shortens its stride, it rebalances its weight toward the hindquarters. In the actual {{collected}} canter, the horse should carry {{the majority of}} its weight on the hind end, rather than the front end. The hindquarters will sink lower toward the ground, and the forehand will appear higher and lighter. The horse should maintain tempo, rhythm, and <b>impulsion.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{shorten the}} horse's stride, the rider sits taller and lengthens the spine. He or she also {{performs}} multiple half-halts in rhythm with the horse's strides, using the restraining aids {{to ask the}} horse to engage the hindquarters, yet keeping the leg to the horse's sides to keep <b>impulsion.</b> The rider should not hold the aids or hang onto the horse's mouth when shortening. If the rider does not keep sufficient leg on, the horse will simply fall onto the forehand or break into the trot or walk.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} this {{sequence}} is in beat two: the grounded hind and foreleg are not diagonal pairs, but {{are on the same}} side of the horse (in this case, the outside). This means that the horse is balancing on only one side of its body, which is very difficult for the horse, making it hard to keep the animal balanced, rhythmical, and keeping <b>impulsion.</b> A horse that is cross-firing cannot perform to the best of its ability, and can even be dangerous (such as an unbalanced, cross-firing horse who must jump a huge, solid cross-country obstacle). Additionally, it makes for a very uncomfortable, awkward ride, producing a rolling movement often described as riding an eggbeater, which makes it difficult for the rider to perform to the best of his or her abilities.|$|E

40|$|We obtain error bounds for {{monotone}} approximation schemes of a stochastic impulse control problem. This is {{an extension}} of the theory for error estimates for the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. For obtaining these bounds we build a sequence of stochastic impulse control problems, and a sequence of monotone approximation schemes. Extending methods of Barles and Jakobsen, we give error estimate for each problem of the sequence. Using these bounds we obtain the result. We obtain the same estimate on the rate of convergence as in the equation without <b>impulsions...</b>|$|R

25|$|He often {{referred}} to Le Sage's theory in his lectures on physics at the University of Göttingen. However, around 1796 Lichtenberg changed his views after being persuaded by the arguments of Immanuel Kant, who criticized any kind of theory that attempted to replace attraction with <b>impulsion.</b> Kant {{pointed out that the}} very existence of spatially extended configurations of matter, such as particles of non-zero radius, implies the existence of some sort of binding force to hold the extended parts of the particle together. Now, that force cannot be explained by the push from the gravitational particles, because those particles too must hold together in the same way. To avoid this circular reasoning, Kant asserted that there must exist a fundamental attractive force. This was precisely the same objection that had always been raised against the impulse doctrine of Descartes in the previous century, and had led even the followers of Descartes to abandon that aspect of his philosophy.|$|E
500|$|For Max Scheler, {{the concept}} of Drang is the {{centerpiece}} of philosophical anthropology and metaphysics. [...] Though his concept has been important throughout his entire philosophical career, it was only developed later in his life when his focus shifted from phenomenology to metaphysics. [...] Like Bergson's élan vital, Drang (drive or <b>impulsion)</b> is the impetus of all life; however, unlike in Bergson's vitalistic metaphysics, the significance of Drang is that it provides the motivation and driving force even of Spirit (Geist). [...] Spirit, which includes all theoretical intentionality, is powerless without the movement of Drang, the material principle, as well as Eros, the psychological principle.|$|E
500|$|Some Arabians, {{though not}} all, have 5 lumbar {{vertebrae}} {{instead of the}} usual 6, and 17 pairs of ribs rather than 18. A quality Arabian has both a relatively horizontal croup and a properly angled pelvis as well as good croup length and depth to the hip (determined by the length of the pelvis), that allows agility and <b>impulsion.</b> A misconception confuses the topline of the croup with the angle of the [...] "hip" [...] (the pelvis or ilium), leading some to assert that Arabians have a flat pelvis angle and cannot use their hindquarters properly. However, the croup is formed by the sacral vertebrae. The hip angle is determined by the attachment of the ilium to the spine, the structure and length of the femur, and other aspects of hindquarter anatomy, which is not correlated to the topline of the sacrum. Thus, the Arabian has conformation typical of other horse breeds built for speed and distance, such as the Thoroughbred, where the angle of the ilium is more oblique than that of the croup. Thus, the hip angle is not necessarily correlated to the topline of the croup. Horses bred to gallop need a good length of croup and good length of hip for proper attachment of muscles, and so unlike angle, length of hip and croup do go together as a rule.|$|E
5000|$|Petrażycki conceives of law as an empirical, {{psychological}} {{phenomenon that}} {{can best be}} studied by introspection.

If this legal experience refers to normative facts in a broad sense (statutes, court decisions, but also contracts, customs, commands of any sort) he calls it [...] "positive law"; if it lacks such reference, he talks of [...] "intuitive law".|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we argue that {{learning}} initiatives could be better recognized and mediated {{in order to support}} meaningful learning and agency in music education. We base our argument on John Dewey’s notions as to how learning initiatives emerge from indeterminate situations as <b>impulsions</b> and how learning as contextual inquiry towards a practical conclusion proceeds. The view proposed is not teacher-centered, student-centered, nor tradition-based, but situation-originated, indicating the significance of the learning situation as a pedagogical point of departure. From this standpoint, the teacher's task is not primarily to realize the goals of the written curriculum, but to inquire into possibilities for interlacing her and her students’ intentions along the curricular aims. This view calls forth the teacher’s capability to seize the dynamic moment: to recognize, inspire, and mediate <b>impulsions</b> towards pedagogically meaningful directions {{with the help of her}} previous experiences, curricular understanding, and pedagogical tact. We also elaborate on the more field-specific issues of music education, especially as concerns music teacher education and creativity in the musical classroom. Throughout the article, we use songcrafting as a case to illustrate how a situation-originated perspective can be applied in actual classroom practice.
