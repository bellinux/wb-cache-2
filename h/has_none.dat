5|$|The film also explores father-son relationships, {{not only}} between Michael Sullivan and his son, but between Sullivan and his boss, John Rooney, and between Rooney and Connor. Sullivan {{simultaneously}} idolizes and fears Rooney, and Sullivan's son {{feels the same}} about his own father. Rooney's son, Connor, <b>has</b> <b>none</b> of Sullivan's redeeming qualities, and Rooney is conflicted about whom to protect: his biological son or his surrogate son. Connor is jealous of his father's relationship with Sullivan, which fuels his actions, ultimately causing a domino effect that drives the film.|$|E
5|$|Unique to this {{adaptation}} of the story, Marceau finds additional clues such as a crate full of living accommodations in the security vault of the baggage compartment {{and a picture of}} Michel's family, despite the fact that Poirot's nephew radios that the man <b>has</b> <b>none.</b> After explaining the second solution, Poirot reveals that Michel is not who he appears, but is in fact Robert Perkinson, Cassetti's criminal partner. Perkinson confirms this to the shock of the other passengers and reveals that Cassetti kept Daisy Armstrong at his house, but Cassetti gunned down Perkinson's daughter, Teresa, whom he mistook for Daisy.|$|E

25|$|D.sect. Diplophragma {{was defined}} as {{containing}} a single species, D.bipinnatifida (now Banksia bipinnatifida), which Brown thought contained two seed separators.

25|$|A {{person does}} not have to have each of these, but if {{something}} has all five then it definitely is a person whether it is biologically human or not, while if it <b>has</b> <b>none</b> or perhaps only one then it is not a person, again whether it is biologically human or not. The fetus has at most one, consciousness (and this only after it becomes susceptible to pain—the timing of which is disputed), and hence is not a person.|$|E
25|$|A {{bell tower}} is a tower that {{contains}} {{one or more}} bells, or {{that is designed to}} hold bells even if it <b>has</b> <b>none.</b> Such a tower commonly serves as part of a church, and will contain church bells, but there are also many secular bell towers, often part of a municipal building, an educational establishment, or a tower built specifically to house a carillon. Church bell towers often incorporate clocks, and secular towers usually do, as a public service.|$|E
25|$|They {{were once}} {{considered}} to be one species; however, since 1928, they have been recognized as two distinct species: the common chimpanzee (P. troglodytes) who live north of the Congo River, and the bonobo (P. paniscus) who live south of it. In addition, P. troglodytes is divided into four subspecies, while P. paniscus <b>has</b> <b>none.</b> Based on genome sequencing, the two extant Pan species diverged around one million years ago. The most obvious differences are that chimpanzees are somewhat larger, more aggressive and male-dominated, while the bonobos are more gracile, peaceful, and female-dominated.|$|E

25|$|Structural {{features}} are sparse or unresolved {{in this part}} of Mercury. The Kuiper quadrangle apparently <b>has</b> <b>none</b> of the scarps that occur elsewhere on the planet that have been interpreted as high-angle reverse faults. The most prominent structures are the rings associated with some large craters or basins, faults that transect crater floors, and lobate scarps and ridges in the plains materials. Most of the faults and scarps that transect crater floors clearly delineate crater-filling materials standing at different levels, and in at least two craters (19° S., 31°; 16° N., 30°), the traces of the faults on the crater walls indicate that the faults have normal displacements. A few faults cut intercrater areas and trend generally northwest or northeast (Scott and others, 1976).|$|E
25|$|Joey Branning (David Witts) catches Carl dealing {{drugs in}} the nightclub, R and informs Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and Kirsty's husband Max Branning (Jake Wood), who confront and {{threaten}} Carl. Max calls the police because he thinks Carl is involved in Kirsty nearly getting mugged by Carl's brother Adam White (Ben Wigzell) and Carl is checked for drugs by the police in front of Kirsty. Carl <b>has</b> <b>none,</b> and later tells Max that in three weeks' time, he will end Max and Kirsty's relationship. Three weeks later, Carl deliberately cuts the brakes on his car, then takes Phil as his passenger, and crashes it after releasing Phil's seatbelt. Phil is hospitalised and Carl frames Max for cutting the brakes after forcing Ian to become a false witness, promising to cancel the debt. Max is arrested and released on bail, until Carl goads him into attacking him, and he is remanded in custody. Max ends his relationship with Kirsty under Carl's instructions, who has threatened to harm his daughter Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa).|$|E
25|$|Broadcast 15 February 1995, {{the final}} episode deals with plants {{that live in}} hostile environments. Attenborough visits Ellesmere Island, north of the Arctic Circle, to {{demonstrate}} that even {{in a place that}} is unconducive to life, it can be found. Algae and lichens grow in or on rock, and during summer, when the ice melts, flowers are much more apparent. However, they must remain close to the ground {{to stay out of the}} chilling wind. In the Tasmanian mountains, plants conserve heat by growing into 'cushions' that act as solar panels, with as many as a million individual shoots grouped together as one. Others, such as the lobelia in Mount Kenya, have a 'fur coat' of dense hairs on their leaves. The saguaro cactus in the Sonoran Desert flourishes because of its ability to retain vast amounts of water, which can't be lost through leaves because it <b>has</b> <b>none.</b> Many desert dwellers benefit from an accelerated life cycle, blooming rapidly within weeks after rainfall. Conversely, Mount Roraima is one of the wettest places on Earth. It is a huge sandstone plateau with high waterfalls and nutrients are continuously washed away, so plants have to adapt their diet if they are to survive. A bladderwort is shown invading a bromeliad. Inhabitants of lakes have other problems to contend with: those that dominate the surface will proliferate, and the Amazon water lily provides an apt illustration. Attenborough ends the series with an entreaty for the conservation of plant species.|$|E

25|$|In Half-Blood Prince, Harry {{is invited}} to {{the first meeting of}} the Slug Club held on the Hogwarts Express. Slughorn sets less-stringent entry {{criteria}} for Advanced Potions than his predecessor, lowering the required grade from a perfect O (Outstanding) to the above-average E (Exceeds Expectations). This last-minute change enables Harry and Ron to take Potions at NEWT level. However, since Harry had not expected to be allowed to join the course, he <b>has</b> <b>none</b> of the necessary materials, and Slughorn lends him an old textbook until Harry can procure his own. Later, Harry does buy a new copy of Advanced Potion-Making from Flourish and Blotts, but switches the covers and gives back the new book. During his first class, Slughorn offers a small amount of Felix Felicis to the student who brews the best cauldron of the Draught of Living Death. Harry wins with the help of handwritten notes in the borrowed textbook, which had once belonged to Snape, unbeknownst to him. When Ron falls victim to a high-strength love potion, Slughorn administers an antidote, but then nearly kills him with a drink of poisoned mead, not knowing that the bottle had been planted by Draco Malfoy in an attempt to kill Dumbledore. Harry later uses the Felix Felicis to help retrieve a memory from Slughorn that details the conversation between the professor and Riddle about Horcruxes as well as the possibility of creating more than one Horcrux.|$|E
