5|$|<b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch</b> was {{the second}} deadliest Atlantic {{hurricane}} on record and the deadliest recorded hurricane in the satellite era. The storm was the thirteenth tropical storm, ninth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 1998 hurricane season. Along with Hurricane Georges, Mitch was the most notable hurricane in the season. At the time, <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch</b> was the strongest Atlantic hurricane observed {{in the month of}} October, though it has since been surpassed by Hurricane Wilma of the 2005 season. The hurricane matched the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record (it has since dropped to seventh).|$|E
5|$|Overall, <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch</b> {{caused an}} {{estimated}} $3.8billion in damage, of which $2.005billion was from direct damages {{and the remainder}} from indirect costs. The overall impact represented about 70% of Honduras's annual gross domestic product (GDP).|$|E
5|$|After the {{disaster}} caused by <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch,</b> {{countries around the}} world donated significant aid, totaling $6.3billion (1998USD). Throughout Central America, which was recovering from an economic crisis that occurred in 1996, many wished to continue the growth of the infrastructure and economy. In addition, after witnessing the vulnerability to hurricanes, the affected governments endeavored to prevent such a disaster from occurring again.|$|E
25|$|The season {{produced}} fourteen tropical depressions, all {{of which}} intensified into tropical storms, ten became hurricanes, and three became major hurricanes. The two most significant storms of the season, in terms of loss of life and damage, were <b>hurricanes</b> Georges and <b>Mitch.</b> The former traveled {{across much of the}} Greater and Lesser Antilles and made landfall in Mississippi as a Category2 hurricane. Resulting in extensive damage and a large number of fatalities. <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch's</b> slow movement over Central America caused catastrophic flooding, making it the second deadliest Atlantic tropical cyclone on record.|$|R
50|$|The 23 {{independent}} {{countries of}} the Caribbean basin region together form the sixth largest export market for U.S. goods, totaling $19 billion and absorbing 2.7 percent of U.S. exports in 1999. However, the devastation of <b>hurricanes</b> <b>Mitch</b> and Georges in 1998 set the regional economy back. In addition, the U.S.'s signing of the NAFTA with Mexico in 1994 had caused Caribbean basin countries to lose the preferential treatment they had previously enjoyed.|$|R
50|$|Love FM {{guided the}} nation through the {{national}} emergencies brought on by <b>Hurricanes</b> <b>Mitch,</b> Keith, Chantal and Iris. In many villages, especially those in Southern Belize, Love FM's signal {{was the only one}} they could receive. An independent survey conducted by British Forces in 2006 showed that despite {{the fact that there are}} 36 radio stations in Belize today some 66.6 percent of those surveyed still rely on Love FM during national emergencies such as in Hurricane Dean in 2007.|$|R
5|$|In all, <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch</b> caused {{at least}} 3,800 {{fatalities}} in Nicaragua, of {{which more than}} 2,000 {{were killed in the}} towns of El Provenir and Rolando Rodriguez from the landslide at the Casita volcano. The mudslide buried at least four villages completely in several feet of mud. Throughout the entire country, the hurricane left between 500,000 and 800,000 homeless. In all, damage in Nicaragua is estimated at around $1billion (1998USD).|$|E
5|$|The Inter-American Development Bank {{approved}} $197.4million {{in loans}} in 1998, {{most of which}} due to <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch.</b> The loans were to assist in rebuilding damaged infrastructure, including for water systems, transportation, and houses. Various countries provided nearly $2.8billion to the country in aid, which limited the annual debt following the hurricane's damage. The foreign aid due to the storm largely ended by 2003.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the storm}} struck, Honduras was facing {{decreased}} food supplies due to ongoing El Niño conditions. The economy {{had been growing}} at a rate similar to the previous year until Mitch struck, and was largely dependent on exports. About 73% {{of the population was}} living in poverty when the storm struck. <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch</b> set back the economies of various countries in the region, including Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador, after they had improved throughout the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Following the storm, the United Nations {{deployed}} {{field assessment}} teams {{to survey the}} damage caused by Katrina. The International Organization for Migration helped relocate affected families and construct at least 300 new residences for victims of Katrina and <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch</b> the year prior. The Pan American Health Organization also deployed assessment teams to survey the area for the possibility of post-storm diseases. Due to the lack of any significant damage, the name Katrina was not retired and was re-used in the 2005 season; however, due to the catastrophic damage caused by the storm, it was retired in 2006 and was replaced with the name Katia.|$|E
5|$|Overall, <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch</b> killed about 7,000people in Honduras, with 11,000missing in {{the months}} after the storm. There were 8,000people listed as missing about ten days after Mitch struck, {{although}} problems with record-keeping made it difficult to determine the exact total. Choluteca Department in the southern portion of the country had the most deaths, with 1,200 fatalities. Francisco Morazán Department, which includes Tegucigalpa, had about 1,000deaths, and Yoro Department had 911fatalities. There were deaths in every department, however. Many of the dead were buried in mass graves or were cremated. The storm injured 12,272people nationwide, mostly in Choluteca and Cortés departments.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Katrina was a short-lived, weak {{tropical}} cyclone that produced minor damage across areas previously devastated by <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch</b> in 1998.

5|$|Despite being a {{very weak}} storm, forecasters were wary about Katrina, as Central America was devastated by <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch</b> exactly one year earlier. There was {{considerable}} fear of additional flash flooding and mudslides across the mountainous region. Immediately after being declared a tropical depression, a tropical storm warning was issued for Nicaragua, and it was extended to the San Andrés islands of Colombia shortly afterward. Officials in Honduras evacuated 71 families from the district of Colón and another 17 families from other at-risk areas. Along the coastline of Honduras, a red alert was declared as torrential rains were anticipated to produce deadly mudslides in areas still recovering from Mitch nearly one year ago.|$|E
5|$|Due to the threat, the {{government}} of Honduras evacuated some of the 45,000 citizens on the Bay Islands and prepared all air and naval resources. The government of Belize issued a purple alert and asked for citizens on offshore islands {{to leave for the}} mainland. Because the hurricane threatened to strike near Belize City as a Category4 hurricane, much of the city was evacuated in fear of a repeat of Hurricane Hattie 37years earlier. Guatemala issued a purple alert as well, recommending boats to stay in port, telling people to prepare or seek shelter, and warning of potential overflowing rivers. By the time <b>hurricane</b> <b>Mitch</b> made landfall, numerous people were evacuated along the western Caribbean coastline, including 100,000 in Honduras, 10,000 in Guatemala, and 20,000 in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics {{in several different}} ways. One such way is if it moves over land, thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself, quickly losing strength. Most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure {{within a day or}} two, or evolve into extra{{tropical cyclone}}s. There is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed to get back over open warm water, such as with Hurricane Ivan. If it remains over mountains for even a short time, weakening will accelerate. Many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain, when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall. This rainfall may lead to deadly floods and mudslides, {{as was the case with}} <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch</b> around Honduras in October 1998. Without warm surface water, the storm cannot survive.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch's</b> {{meteorological}} history {{began with}} its origins over Africa as a tropical wave and lasted until its dissipation as an extratropical cyclone {{north of the}} United Kingdom. Tropical Depression Thirteen formed on October22, 1998, over the southwestern Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave that exited Africa on October10. It executed a small loop, and while doing so intensified into Tropical Storm Mitch. A weakness in a ridge allowed the storm to track slowly to the north. After becoming disorganized due to wind shear from a nearby upper-level low, Mitch quickly intensified in response to improving conditions which included warm waters and good outflow. It became a hurricane on October24 and developed an eye. After turning to the west, Mitch rapidly intensified, first into a major hurricane on October25 and then into a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale the next day.|$|R
40|$|Background: Following the {{occurrence}} of natural or manmade disaster, relief worker priorities include providing water, food, shelter, and immunizations for displaced persons. Like these essential initiatives, reproductive health education and services must also be incorporated into recovery efforts. Purpose: This study examined reproductive health care indicators, including the key areas of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infection (STI) transmission, family planning and pregnancy-related health services, and selected reproductive health education knowledge among refu-gees and internally displaced persons residing in southern Belize following <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch’s</b> assault on the region in 1998. In addition, {{the occurrence}} of gender-based violence was measured. Methods: Internally displaced persons and refugee {{men and women were}} interviewed about prenatal care and delivery services, family planning knowledge and utilization, HIV/AIDS and other STI transmission knowledge, and sexual violence. Results: Numerous misconceptions about HIV/AIDS and other STIs existed. Most persons had never used any family planning method. Oral contraceptive use declined as length of stay at refugee camps increased. Most women were able to access prenatal services. Violence against women, including sexual violence, was reported. Discussion: Better access to medical services and education about reproductive health issues are needed following disasters. Translation to Health Education Practice: Health educators can contribute to relief efforts. Moreover, other relief workers should be equipped with skills and knowledg...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Central America Field Epidemiology Training Program (CA FETP) is {{a public}} health {{capacity-building}} training programme aimed at developing high-caliber field epidemiologists at various levels {{of the public health}} system. It began in 2000 as part of the effort to rebuild public health infrastructure in six Central American and Caribbean countries following the devastation of <b>Hurricanes</b> <b>Mitch</b> and Georges in late 1998. Since then, the CA FETP has evolved from one regional training programme managed by CDC to several national FETPs with each country assuming ownership of its domestic programme. The curriculum is competency-based, and is divided into a three-tiered training pyramid that corresponds to the needs at the local, district and central levels of the health system. Trainees at each tier spend about 20 % of their time in the classroom and 80 % in the field implementing what they have learned while being mentored by graduates of the programme. FETP trainees have responded to multiple natural disasters and conducted hundreds of investigations including surveillance evaluations, outbreak responses and planned studies. Also graduates of the CA FETP are assuming influential positions in their respective ministries. As countries meet the challenge of institutionalizing their programmes, the CA FETP concept will increasingly be recognized as a model for sustainable public health capacity development. </p...|$|R
5|$|<b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch</b> wrought {{significant}} damage to Honduras, affecting {{nearly the entire}} population and causing damage in all 18 departments. High winds near the coast knocked down trees, particularly in mountainous areas. The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean estimated that Mitch caused the worst floods of the 20th century in the country. Severe flooding occurred in the northern region, which washed away more than 25entire villages. In San Pedro Sula in northwestern Honduras, flooding covered several neighborhoods and the international airport. Near the coast, high waves destroyed hotels and houses while swollen rivers flooded nearby areas. Damage was heaviest in Colón and Atlántida departments. In the latter department, the Cangrejal River left heavy damage along its path after it flooded. In Choluteca and Valle departments in the southern portion of the country, river flooding swept away houses and affected neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Operation California {{began using}} the name Operation USA because it better {{described}} the effort and intent of the organization to represent the entire American people. In 1989 Operation USA facilitated operations on children in Vietnam who had cleft palates by a Los Angeles-based plastic surgeon, Dr Stanley Frileck. Medical aid and rebuilding effort was delivered to Mexico in 1990, by OPUSA. In 1991 OPUSA delivered aid to Bangladesh. OpUSA delivered aid to war torn Somali's in 1993. In 1994 OpUSA provided earthquake relief. In 1995 the organization provided aid to <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch</b> survivors in Honduras and Nicaragua. In 1999 OpUSA supplied aid to storm victims in Mexico. In 2003 OpUSA delivered aid to Iraq War victims in the Persian Gulf. The tsunami victims in Sri Lanka and Indonesia were aided by OpUSA in 2004, {{as well as the}} Mexico City Flood victims.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{damage was}} minimal {{as a result}} of Katrina. Only a few small mudslides were reported, along with some minor flooding, as the storm tracked across Central America. It was {{estimated}} that between 10 and 15inches (250 to 375mm) of rain fell across parts of the region {{as a result of}} Katrina, with one report of 3.58inches (91mm) in six hours from the island of San Andrés east of Nicaragua. Roughly 1,200 people were evacuated to emergency shelters in Honduras due to flooding. At least five bridges sustained damage and the cities of Tocoa and Trujillo were isolated as the Aguán and Siline rivers overflowed their banks. The water pipes recently constructed after being destroyed by <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch,</b> worth HNL 170,000 (US$9,000) were once again destroyed by Katrina. The most severely affected area in Honduras was the Valle del Aguán.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Rita is {{the fourth}} strongest Atlantic {{hurricane}} in terms of barometric pressure and one of three tropical cyclones from 2005 on the list, with the others being Wilma and Katrina at first and sixth, respectively. However, with a barometric pressure of 895mbar (hPa; 26.43inHg), Rita is the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. <b>Hurricanes</b> Camille, <b>Mitch,</b> and Dean share intensities for the seventh strongest Atlantic hurricane at 905mbar (hPa; 26.73inHg).

5|$|Several storms made {{landfall}} {{or directly}} affected land. Hurricane Bonnie made landfall in southeastern North Carolina as a Category2 hurricane in late August, killing five people and causing about $1billion in damage. Hurricane Earl caused $79million in damage and three deaths after making landfall in Florida as a Category1 hurricane. The two deadliest and most destructive hurricanes of the season, Hurricane Georges and Mitch, caused $9.72billion in damage and $6.2billion in damage, respectively. Hurricane Georges was an intense Category4 hurricane that moved through {{many of the}} Caribbean Islands, causing significant damage before making landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi. <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch</b> was a very powerful and destructive late-season hurricane that affected much of Central America before making landfall in Florida as a tropical storm. The significant amount of rainfall that Mitch produced across Central America caused significant damage and killed at least 11,000people, making the system the second deadliest hurricane in recorded history, behind only the Great Hurricane of 1780.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch</b> {{formed on}} October22 {{in the southwestern}} Caribbean Sea, and it {{eventually}} intensified into a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale by October26. By that time, the hurricane was {{just north of the}} coast of Honduras, and was expected by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and various tropical cyclone forecast models to turn to the north. When the track was more westward than expected, the NHC recommended early on October26 for a hurricane warning to be issued for the northeastern Honduran coast, although difficulties in communications prevented their immediate implementation. Within a few hours, a hurricane warning was in place between Limón to the Honduras and Nicaragua border, including the offshore Swan Island. When Mitch still failed to turn to the north, the government of Honduras issued a hurricane warning for the remainder of their coastline. The hurricane weakened while turning to the south, and made landfall in Honduras 134km (83mi) east of La Ceiba, with estimated winds of 130km/h (80mph). Mitch continued to weaken while moving slowly westward across the country.|$|E
5|$|Portions of Central America also {{experienced}} flooding {{related to the}} rains, causing landslides and washing away bridges and roads. Over 100,000people in the region had to leave their homes, and there were 70deaths in Central America. In Guatemala, 12people died related to the flooding, including two due to cholera from stagnant waters. Officials declared a red alert in Honduras, which mobilized the army for potential relief work and caused Red Cross shelters to open; the alert was dropped after rainfall eased on October8. About 6,500people evacuated in Honduras after four rivers flooded, which damaged or destroyed several houses. About 6,000 people had to evacuate in Sula Valley in the northern portion of the country, after the government released water from the El Cajón Dam. Damage was estimated at $1.5million (14million pesos), and there were 34deaths. Due to people having to evacuate, several schools were closed. The country was severely affected by <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Mitch</b> only a year prior, and bridges that were rebuilt after the hurricane were again destroyed.|$|E
40|$|The Central American Field Epidemiology Training Program (CA FETP) was {{established}} in 2000 {{as part of the}} effort to rebuild the public health infrastructure in Central American and Caribbean countries destroyed by <b>Hurricanes</b> <b>Mitch</b> and Georges in 1998. The Division of Public Health Systems and Workforce Development (DPHSWD), in the Center for Global Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) partnered with public health institutions in eight countries to establish the regional program. The initial program included Belize, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. Haiti and Belize were recently added to the program. CA FETP strengthens system capacity by producing a highly-skilled public health workforce with field experience in epidemiology and research methods. Academic accreditation is provided by the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala in Guatemala City, which is also the site of the CDC-Central America Region Office (CDC-CAR). Through CA FETP, qualified candidates are trained and often move on to leadership positions in their respective national public health institutions. To date, CA FETP has trained more than 3, 000 public health personnel in applied epidemiology through the basic, intermediate and advanced programs. The goals of CA FETP are to: Build national epidemiological and institutional capacities in surveillance, outbreak investigation and planned studies; Foster a science and evidence-based approach for developing and implementing effective public health programs and policies; Maintain the technical partnerships between member countries and CDC which facilitates in-country scientific and programmatic support.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In the fall of 1998, when <b>hurricanes</b> <b>Mitch</b> and Georges struck Central America and the Caribbean, the United States and other donors responded by providing emergency relief, such as food, water, medical supplies, and temporary shelter. Also, In May 1999, Congress passed emergency supplemental legislation that provided $ 621 million for a disaster recovery and reconstruction fund for the affected countries, as well as reimbursement for costs incurred by U. S. departments and agencies during the immediate relief phase. The U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and other departments and agencies made significant achievements in helping the affected countries rebuild their infrastructure and recover from the hurricanes. USAID and others used the disaster recovery assistance to bring about economic recovery, improve public health and access to education, provide permanent housing for displaced families, and improve disaster mitigation and preparedness. To achieve these broad objectives, USAID funded infrastructure construction and repair, technical assistance and training, loans for farmers and small businesses, and some equipment. In addition to its normal controls, USAID ensured that the funds were spent for intended purposes. USAID coordinated its activities with 12 other departments and agencies that were allocated $ 96 million for disaster recovery efforts. USAID also coordinated with other bilateral and multilateral donors through formal consultative group meetings and informal contacts among mission staff and other donors. USAID attempted to strengthen the capacity of host government audit in situations {{as a means to}} resist corruption. However, USAID was not successful in this area, mostly due to country conditions. USAID did not begin expending the supplemental funds until January 2000, 7 months after the appropriation was enacted. Some of the factors that added time included arranging for additional program staff and contractor support; ensuring that financial controls and other oversight measures were in place; coordinating with and planning for the involvement of numerous other departments and agencies; and providing for U. S. contractors and other organizations to compete for most of the contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements that were awarded. ...|$|R
