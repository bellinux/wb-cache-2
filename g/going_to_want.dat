Murray said [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to let the team down or let Tim down, I'd feel terrible if I {{was the one that}} was responsible for losing Tim's last tie.

500|$|Throughout {{their careers}} Drake and Minaj {{maintained}} a close personal and business relationship, and were frequent collaborators. However, while recording Nothing Was the Same, Drake {{did not work}} with Minaj or anyone from Cash Money Records, leading her to say: [...] "I'm Young Money 'til the death of me, Drake can do what Drake do, but Nicki Minaj is a whole different person. I think your team is your team. Who gives a fuck about trying to be different?

500|$|George Hertzberg, a University of Southern California {{graduate}} {{with experience in}} sitcoms and commercials, was chosen based on one of Adam's monologues he was given to read for the audition. Hertzberg counted luck and being {{in the right place}} at the right time in helping him get the role. Many recurring characters on Buffy start with one or two episodes, and when the writers or producers like their chemistry with other actors, they often make them a regular part of the cast. Hertzberg, however, understood at his reading that Adam was to be a major part of the fourth season. Casting Director Amy Britt needed someone physically imposing for the part, with the [...] Hertzberg fitting the bill. Britt stated, [...] "this is a guy we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> eventually to have some affinity for. We can't just see him as an evil being. He is evil to the core [...] should scare us with his actions; but there's also innocence. Like the Frankenstein monster, you realize that they're only doing what they know. Or what they've been programmed to do. These aren't born creatures, these are creations." ...|$|E

500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{gave the}} episode 9.5/10, writing [...] "This wasn't {{just a good}} episode – it was great. It {{capitalized}} on absolutely every scrap of promise the show has had in its first nine episodes. Tell your friends and neighbors, they're probably <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to tune in when this returns after the break. Not only that, but this episode heightens and improves every episode that has come before – as now all the pieces are important". Total Sci-Fi Online rated the episode 7/10, and expressed the wish that [...] "Safe" [...] {{could have been used}} as the series' pilot. [...] "The central premise has more pull, it draws together various plot strands going back to the pilot, meaningfully involves several seemingly incidental characters and events from the past, and zips along at a better pace. It’s a shame it took this long to reach this part of the puzzle, where a few of the pieces at last click satisfyingly into place". Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend thought the episode [...] "was actually well thought out, well written, and not confusing at all. Plus, the characters seemed to be complete. Now, all the brains behind this could-be great show have to do is keep it up".|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of The Lion King coincided {{with that of}} Pocahontas, {{which most of the}} animators of Walt Disney Feature Animation decided to work on instead, believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two. The story artists also did not have much faith in the project, with Chapman declaring she was reluctant to accept the job [...] "because the story wasn't very good", and writer Burny Mattinson saying to co-worker Joe Ranft [...] "I don't know who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to watch that one." [...] Most of the leading animators either were doing their first major work supervising a character, or had much interest in animating an animal. Thirteen of these supervising animators, both in California and in Florida, were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the film's main characters. The animation leads for the main characters included Mark Henn on young Simba, Ruben A. Aquino on adult Simba, Andreas Deja on Scar, Aaron Blaise on young Nala, Anthony DeRosa on adult Nala, and Tony Fucile on Mufasa. Nearly 20 minutes of the film, including the [...] "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" [...] sequence, were animated at the Disney-MGM Studios facility. More than 600 artists, animators, and technicians contributed to The Lion King. Weeks before the film was to be released, the 1994 Northridge earthquake shut down the studio and required the animators to finish their work from home.|$|E

[...] Kemper replied, [...] "No, good night!", before waiting for her to fall asleep and {{returning}} to bludgeon her with a claw hammer and slit her throat with a knife. He then decapitated her and engaged in irrumatio with her severed head before using it as a dart board; stating that he [...] "put [...] on a shelf and screamed at it for an hour... threw darts at it," [...] and ultimately, [...] "smashed her face in." [...] He also cut out her tongue and larynx {{and put them in the}} garbage disposal. However, the garbage disposal could not break down the tough vocal cords and ejected the tissue back into the sink. [...] "That seemed appropriate," [...] Kemper later said, [...] "as much as she'd bitched and screamed and yelled at me over so many years." [...] He then had sex with his mother's corpse, hid it in a closet and went out to drink. Upon his return, he invited his mother's best friend, 59-year-old Sara Taylor [...] "Sally" [...] Hallett, over to the house for dinner and a movie. When Hallett arrived, he strangled her to death, decapitated her and spent the night with her exanimate body.

The publisher was simultaneously shopping it around for a film sale. That's how it wound up in my hands. I was reading it and somewhere on page three I said yes. It was the fastest I said yes to anything. But Ben hadn't written the book yet, and I assumed that Sony was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> me to wait for Ben to write the book, and I would start a year from now.

She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem.

[...] "Most XBLA titles are short and can often be finished in a day [...] Aqua’s campaign feels appropriate for the price, and doesn’t overstay its welcome."

[...] 1UP.com's Eric Neigher appreciated the game's basic gameplay. [...] He called it a [...] "simple game with a lot of simple fun to be had." [...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed gave high remarks {{in regards to}} Aquas customization and upgrade system which when combined with the game's story gives Aqua [...] "a personality of its own."

2500|$|The Lost Hero {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics and fans.

The novel received a mixed review from Vicky Smith of Kirkus Reviews, who wrote that the [...] "Greek-vs.-Roman tension tantalizes" [...] and that [...] "incidental details that bring the gods into the story often shine." [...] However, she also noted that there are [...] "far too many pages of stretched-out action, telling not showing and awkward dialogue" [...] and believed that only the die-hard fans would enjoy the book. She said that [...] "unless Riordan tightens things up considerably by number five, they may find themselves hoping {{that it does not}} end with a third Great Prophecy". The Seattle Times Karen Macpherson called the Greek and Roman mix [...] "fascinating" [...] and also said that the [...] "characters are interesting and well-developed, and the richly complex story has Riordan's trademark wry humor and nearly nonstop action". Kidsreads, on the other hand, gave a mixed review, stating [...] "I always learn something new whenever I read these books, and it certainly helps that I laugh along the way. You’re not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to miss this one!" [...] but also comments on the confusing plot line, commenting that [...] "This time, they cross over to Roman mythology, and the sometimes-blurred lines between the two cultures are examined in closer detail." [...] The book also received a positive review from The Epoch Times, which said [...] "If anyone was afraid that Riordan couldn’t top his Percy Jackson series—they can quit worrying. This new series, even though in the same genre as the Percy Jackson group, has fresh ideas, more mystery and magic and keeps the reader engrossed from start to finish." ...|$|E
