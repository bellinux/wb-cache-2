50|$|Women’s craft {{has often}} been undervalued or ignored in the art world. Women’s craft is {{considered}} belonging to a lesser cultural sphere and categorized under such terms as ‘applied’, ‘decorative’ or ‘lesser’ than other art forms such as painting or sculpture. This critique of women’s craft and craftivism as a ‘lesser’ art form has been contested within the discourse of feminism. Some Feminist Art discourse excludes craftivism. This <b>feminist</b> <b>intervention</b> into the art world perpetuates a hierarchy of art where craft is a lower art form.

40|$|This {{integrative}} {{review of}} the effectiveness of feminist social work methods compared 35 independent studies of <b>feminist</b> <b>interventions</b> with 44 independent studies of social work practice that were based on other theoretical orientations. <b>Feminist</b> <b>interventions</b> were observed to be more effective than those based on other practice models. And among feminist social work interventions, radical methods seemed to be more effective than liberal methods. These findings are consistent with a theory by target system interaction that was suggested by a previous meta-analysis (Gorey, Thyer, 2 ̆ 6 Pawluck, 1998). While personal theoretical orientations such as cognitive-behavioral modes of practice seem more supportive of individual client change, systemic-structural models, including feminist ones, seem to be more effective in supporting mutual client-worker strategies to change larger system targets. This study’s review-generated finding of feminist, specifically radical feminist, social work’s differential effectiveness is essentially a screened hypothesis.

40|$|Purpose: Translating the {{well-established}} {{theory of}} the gendered organization into strategic interventions that build more gender equitable organizations {{has proven to be}} difficult. The authors introduce the emergence of the "bifocal approach" and its subsequent development and examine the potential of the "bifocal approach" as a <b>feminist</b> <b>intervention</b> strategy and an alternative means of countering gender inequalities in organizations. While pre-existing transformative interventions focus on more immediately apparent structural change, the focus begins with the development of individuals. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Developed through iterative cycling between theory and practice, the "bifocal approach" links the existing focus on women's development with a focus on transformative organizational change. The bifocal approach deliberately begins with the organization's current way of understanding gender in order to build towards frame-breaking transformative change. Findings: The authors show how the bifocal is able to overcome some of the main difficulties of earlier transformative approaches, maintaining organizational access, partnership building, sustaining a gender focus and ultimately sustaining the change effort itself. The bifocal approach seeks structural change, however, the change effort rests with individuals. The development of individuals, as conceived within the bifocal approach was designed to create a "small wins" ripple effect, linking individual (agency) and organizational change (structure). Practical implications: The bifocal approach offers a comprehensive re-modelling of traditional interventions for other scholars and practitioners to build on. Organizational interventions previously categorized as "fixing women" could be re-examined for their capacity to provide the foundation for transformative change. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper lies in proposing and examining the bifocal approach as a <b>feminist</b> <b>intervention</b> strategy that overcomes the dualism between the existing frames of organizations and the transformative frame of scholars, in order to move practice and theory forward...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reflects}} on an emergent brand of feminist activism in India that responds to everyday sexual {{violence against women}} in public.

While neoliberal reforms have been analyzed within the terms of political economy, this paper extends existing research to consider how neoliberal subjectivities shape a new feminism. The contemporary <b>feminist</b> <b>interventions</b> under review draw from individual testimonials to {{form the basis for}} activism, affirm the agency of participants to transform their urban environments, and foreground desire and consumption as central gendered rights.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the central rationale of feminism, and thus of feminist perspectives in criminology, to bring about change for women subject to the criminal justice system. It argues that any attempt to influence that system, to bring about change or reform, must be considered within the broader context of policy-making and programme development and their underlying assumptions and purposes, as we]] as in relation to specific contextually located histories. It does so by tracing the history of a particular feminist initiative in Canada - a community-based programme in Nova Scotia which offered feminist therapy and counselling to women in conflict with the law. It traces the processes of funding and evaluation for the federal government, and the differential experiences of the project and its clients, the researchers, and the funders. In so doing it considers the role of policy and programme development and of feminist attempts to reform and their failure to impact the lives of sentenced women; it examines the development of feminist methodology and contrasts it with mainstream correctional methodology and evaluation; it explores the development of <b>feminist</b> <b>intervention</b> and some of the problems inherent in such approaches and their appropriateness for women in the correctional system; and it examines the difficulties encountered in evaluating a feminist initiative. The views of the project and of its women clients are explored {{to assess the impact of}} the intervention, its benefits for the women, as well as its limitations. This analysis shows how the project, while successful in avoiding many of the problems of <b>feminist</b> <b>intervention,</b> was unable to sustain itself beyond the period of federal funding, while the evaluation itself proved to be a difficult process. The discrepancies between feminist ways of working and the dominant correctional models, the assumptions underlying programme development and evaluation, and the limitations of that approach are revealed as a series of over-lapping layers which impact on feminist endeavours...|$|R
