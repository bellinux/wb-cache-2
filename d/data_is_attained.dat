30|$|In practice, {{owing to}} the {{complexity}} of real life data, it is cumbersome to find a good statistical distribution for empirical data by trial and error. Instead, it is preferable to use a distribution with very flexible shapes. In the current literature, for survival data, perhaps the most well-known distributions are the exponentiated Weibull distribution (Mudholkar and Srivastava 1993, Mudholkar et al. 1995, Singh et al. 2005) and the four parameter Weibull distribution (Wahed et al. 2009, Jeong 2006). Other distributions such as generalised hyperbolic distribution, g and h distributions and many others could also be suitable candidates. The superiority of GLDs over exponentiated Weibull distribution and comparable performance to the four parameter Weibull distribution in some general settings is demonstrated using simulation studies in Simulation studies. While GLDs may not always outperform specific techniques developed for a special case of survival data, the aim {{of this article is to}} present GLD as a useful general purpose parametric model for survival data. Once the GLD fits to survival <b>data</b> <b>is</b> <b>attained,</b> other summary statistics such as hazards can be easily obtained and will be consistent with the same underlying survival distribution and the distributional shape of survival times can be easily gleaned by plotting the fitted GLD. In contrast, one can only obtain survival probabilities and survival curves using Kaplan Meier (KM) method and other statistical estimates such as hazards, shape of underlying distributions need to be extracted using other techniques, potentially leading to a loss in consistency of estimates due to the employment of different estimation methods on the same data. It is also well known that a parametric method is more powerful in detecting a significant difference compared to a non-parametric method such as KM method, so there is potential for cost saving using less number of patients in clinical trials using a parametric approach to analyse survival data.|$|E

This balance is specified by hyperparameters that control the relative importance of fitting and conforming to various constraints. Here we formulate the conventional "Weighted Minimum Norm" (WMN) solution in terms of hierarchical linear models. An "Expectation-Maximisation" (EM) algorithm is used to obtain a "Restricted Maximum Likelihood" (ReML) estimate of the hyperparameters, before estimating the "Maximum a Posteriori" solution itself. This procedure can be considered a generalisation of previous work that encompasses multiple constraints. Our approach was compared with the "classic" WMN and Maximum Smoothness solutions, using a simplified 2 D source model with synthetic noisy data. The ReML solution was assessed with four types of source location priors: no priors, accurate priors, inaccurate priors, and both accurate and inaccurate priors. The ReML approach proved useful as: (1) The regularisation (or influence of the a priori source covariance) increased as the noise level increased. (2) The localisation error (LE) was negligible when accurate location priors were used. (3) When accurate and inaccurate location priors were used simultaneously, the solution was not influenced by the inaccurate priors. The ReML solution was then applied to real somatosensory-evoked responses to illustrate the application in an empirical setting. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{beginning}} of this century saw the pioneering fabrication of a single molecular transistor using a single C 60 molecule between gold nanowires, and inspired experimentalists and theorists alike to focus on studying phonon assisted transport through nanoscale electronic devices. We have formulated an electron tunnelling model for the current-voltage (I-V) relationship for a C 60 molecular transistor that reproduces trends observed in the experimental I-V curves. A uniform one dimensional tight-binding lattice is used to model the transistor system, with a central defect site representing the molecule. The current is written as a function of tunnelling rates on and off of the molecule, where the rates are calculated using Fermi's Golden Rule and a Green function technique called the Renormalized Perturbation Expansion. In calculating the tunnelling rates, {{a deeper understanding of the}} trends that are seen in the experimental <b>data</b> <b>is</b> <b>attained,</b> and certain new features of the system are uncovered. First, incorporating the degeneracy of the tunnelling state into the expression for the current allows the prediction of the degree of asymmetry in the saturation values for forward and reverse bias current. Also, using the relative sizes of the source-drain voltage gaps for forward and reverse bias current, and the relative sizes of the initial steps in current, we show that the C 60 molecule is negatively charged when in a nanometre sized gap between two gold nanowires. Finally, an experimental method for measuring the effect that varying the gate voltage has on the size of the voltage gap between the tunnelling level of the molecule and the Fermi level of the electrodes is obtained.

Non-regulated trace organic ECs including pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and {{personal care products}} are focused on due to ongoing policy initiatives and the expectant broadening of environmental legislation. These ECs are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment, mainly derived from the discharge of municipal wastewater effluents. Their presence is of concern due to the possible ecological impact (e. g., endocrine disruption) to biota within the environment. To better understand their fate in wastewaters and in the environment, a standardised approach to sampling is needed. This ensures representative <b>data</b> <b>is</b> <b>attained</b> and facilitates {{a better understanding of}} spatial and temporal trends of EC occurrence. During wastewater treatment, {{there is a lack of}} suspended particulate matter analysis due to further preparation requirements and a lack of good analytical approaches. This results in the under-reporting of several ECs entering wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) and the aquatic environment. Also, sludge can act as a concentrating medium for some chemicals during wastewater treatment. The majority of treated sludge is applied directly to agricultural land without analysis for ECs. As a result there is a paucity of information on the fate of ECs in soils and consequently, there has been no driver to investigate the toxicity to exposed terrestrial organisms. Therefore a more holistic approach to environmental monitoring is required, such that the fate and impact of ECs in all exposed environmental compartments are studied. The traditional analytical approach of applying targeted screening with low resolution mass spectrometry (e. g., triple quadrupoles) results in numerous chemicals such as transformation products going undetected. These can exhibit similar toxicity to the parent EC, demonstrating the necessity of using an integrated analytical approach which compliments targeted and non-targeted screening with biological assays to measure ecological impact. With respect to current toxicity testing protocols, failure to consider the enantiomeric distribution of chiral compounds found in the environment, and the possible toxicological differences between enantiomers is concerning. Such information is essential for the development of more accurate environmental risk assessment...|$|E

40|$|Ever {{since the}} middle of the 1920 s, when {{compounds}} from the perovskite structure family {{played a key role in}} the groundbreaking work of Goldschmidt on material synthesis, perovskite transition-metal oxides (TMOs) have repeatedly stimulated new activities in fundamental research as well as in the development of new technical applications. Thus, many perovskite TMOs, for example the ferroelectrics BaTiO 3 and PbTiO 3, have become an integral part of present-day technologies. Intriguing properties of other perovskite TMOs such as ferromagnetic LaMnO(3 +delta) or the high-k dielectric BaZrO 3 and their potential use in future applications are currently investigated. As a large variety of A and B cations can be combined to form the perovskite crystal structure with stoichiometric composition ABO 3, compounds with a wide range of material properties can be synthesized. This makes perovskite transition-metal oxides a unique formal laboratory to test models and theories pertaining to solid state physics. The goal of this thesis is to shed light on the structure-composition-properties relation of this fascinating class of materials from the electronic-structure point of view. The investigations are based on density functional theory (DFT), the most successful theory for the description of ground-state electronic properties from first-principles in combination with the GW approximation (GWA) from many-body perturbation theory which has emerged as the method of choice to describe single-particle excitation spectra of solids. In this work, the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method (FLAPW) is used in all calculations. As an all-electron scheme it is particularly suitable to describe d and f states of transition metals and rare earths contained in the perovskite TMOs. Trends in the electronic structure of three series of prototypical perovskite TMOs including BaTiO 3, BaZrO 3, and PbTiO 3 in the high-temperature cubic crystal phase are investigate to relate changes in the single-particle excitation spectra and band gaps to changes in the composition of the materials. In addition, the effect of symmetry-breaking relaxations from the cubic crystal phase on the electronic structure occurring at room temperature is investigated. The first-principles results emphasize the importance of including these effects in the calculations in order to quantitatively reproduce band gaps measured in experiment. Furthermore, trends in the positions of high-lying core states are analyzed. The calculated positions of the core states agree well with results from photo-emission experiments. Secondly, GW calculations for the three band insulators LaCrO 3, LaMnO 3, and LaFeO 3 are carried out. Results from DFT calculations employing the generalized-gradient approximation with the PBE functional or results obtained from calculations using the hybrid-functional HSE are used as starting point to apply many-body perturbation theory. The analysis of photo-emission spectra focuses specifically on the position of the partially filled d states of the transition metals yielding finite spin-magnetic moments at the transition-metal site of all three compounds which order antiferromagnetically. Whereas the HSE result lead to a general improvement of the PBE results for the spin-magnetic moments, band gaps and photo-emission spectra are best described by the combination of HSE+GW in the case of LaCrO 3 and by PBE+GW calculations for LaMnO 3 and LaFeO 3. For all three compounds, good quantitative agreement with experimental <b>data</b> <b>is</b> <b>attained.</b> The last part of the thesis focuses on the question how accurately a Hubbard model can reproduce the spectrum of a subspace of the full Hilbert space, as this kind of model allows to gain insight into the electronic structure of materials even if first-principles approaches are not applicable. A simple test system is constructed to simulate partially filled valence states whose single-particle excitation spectrum can be calculated exactly. These results are compared with the description for a subspace of the full system obtained from a Hubbard model. The model is designed to yield the best possible approximation for the exact spectrum. The investigations reveal that the Hubbard model cannot reproduce the spectrum exactly as soon as the wave functions of states inside the subspace exhibit a finite overlap with wave functions of states not contained in the subspace. This limits the applicability of the Hubbard model to the description of subspaces with a small degree of hybridization between states inside and outside the subspace...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} awareness for companies to engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities (Carroll, 1999). The benefits of which vary in different companies {{as well as the}} motivations for engaging in it. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a relatively new concept in formal application and lexicon in Uganda, having its roots in its application by multinational companies through philanthropic activities to develop communities in which they operate. It is now very common to see CSR activity reports on most companies’ financial statements and reports. However, the reason why companies in Uganda engage in CSR despite the growing inflation and economic downtown has not yet been researched to the best of the researcher’s knowledge. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate and analyse why companies in Uganda are motivated to engage in CSR to form a baseline for further research. The study sought stakeholder’s perception and attitude towards CSR using open and closed ended questionnaires as well as secondary data collection. The CSR aspect is perceived differently by various stakeholders and therefore the Relativism research approach was used for the study. The primary <b>data</b> <b>was</b> <b>attained</b> from a sample of nine managers from three beverage companies, and 60 consumers from central, east and western Uganda. Secondary <b>data</b> <b>was</b> <b>attained</b> from the companies’ websites and media publications as well was analysed and compared with the theories and drivers on the reason companies engage in CSR that have been advanced by various scholars. Quantitatively, <b>data</b> <b>was</b> analysed using Microsoft excel 2010 and presented as tables and graphs for easy analysis. Quantitatively, the researcher grouped similar responses from the participants’ questionnaires to form a description and used direct quotes from the participants’ responses for substantiation. Findings indicate that firstly, respondents are aware of what CSR entails however, it’s reliant on mainly on philanthropy because of the cultural nature of activities that are carried out by institutions. Stakeholders’ definition of CSR is similarly dependent on the activities that they engage in or have seen companies engage in. Consumers’ decision to use a brand is not yet dependent on the social causes that companies engage in rather on brand attributes. Secondly, CSR activities are mainly centred on the development of society and HIV/Aids treatment which are a major problem gap that the Ugandan government has filled not and this indicates that companies engage in CSR for social economical, ethical and political benefits (Mêlé and Garriga, 2008). I recommend further research that covers a larger consumer and manager sample, more companies and it should cover a larger geographical area as well for more conclusive results...|$|R

A very good agreement between modeled and measured <b>data</b> has <b>been</b> <b>attained.</b> Results show a spatial temperature distribution of about ± 1 °C over an area comparable to the heater area and a directly USB powered heater, demonstrating the suitability of the proposed device for lab-on-chip thermal applications...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{temperature}} is the key factor controlling the microbial survival/inactivation. However, the interactive effects of further stressing environmental conditions may influence microbial inactivation behaviour. The objective of this work was to include, in the inactivation model, temperature, pH and water activity effects using a black box polynomial model, aiming at accurate prediction. Experimental data of Listeria innocua obtained within the temperature range of 52. 5 and 65. 0 °C, pH of 4. 5, 6. 0 and 7. 5, and water activity of 0. 95 and 0. 99 were used for model assessment. A Gompertz-inspired model for microbial inactivation was used, with shoulder period, maximum inactivation rate and tail as parameters. The relations of such parameters with temperature, water activity and pH were purely empirical and assumed to be polynomials. When these mathematical relationships were included in the primary kinetic model, accurate predictions of the inactivation <b>data</b> <b>were</b> <b>attained,</b> thus validating the predictive ability of the model expressed in terms of the stressing environmental factors studied. © 2015 The Authors.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedUnited States Navy officers and enlisted personnel have always recognized the unique power and {{capability of the}} senior enlisted community that binds these groups together and is integral {{to the success of}} Navy operations. Yet, little has been systematically written about the leadership characteristics of this group that make them so vital to the Navy. This study examines senior enlisted leadership in the U. S. Navy, focusing on the unique community of master chief petty officers. <b>Data</b> <b>were</b> <b>attained</b> through in-depth interviews of 19 master chief participants who were identified as particularly successful. Results identify characteristics of the chief petty officer (CPO) that are common to all good leaders, but also characteristics that are unique to this group. For example, the camaraderie of the Chief's Mess provides the CPO Mess immense power, Navy-wide. A philosophy of "command first, person second" is widely endorsed, which creates the ultimate team experience, led by the Command Master Chief. The master chief's unique and innovative characteristics will be critical in sustaining Naval operations in the course of leading the Millennials into the 21 st century. Further research on senior enlisted leadership is suggested. US Navy (USN) autho...|$|R

Deaerator is a component of integrated drive generator (IDG), which is used to separate air from oil. Integrated drive generator is the main power generation unit used in aircrafts to generate electric-power and must be cooled to give maximum efficiency. Mob Jet Oil II is used in these IDGs as a lubricant and coolant. So, in order to get high-quality oil, a deaerator is used to remove trapped air from this Mob Jet Oil II using the centrifugal principle. The reason for entrapment of air may be due to operation of vacuum and high-pressure pumps. In this study, 75 / 90 IDG generic and A 320 classic deaerator performance evaluation was done based on both experimental and numerical techniques. Experimental <b>data</b> <b>was</b> collected from deaerator test rig and numerical <b>data</b> <b>was</b> <b>attained</b> using CFD simulations (software used for CFD simulation is ANSYS CFX). Both experimental and numerical results were compared and also deaerator 75 / 90 generic and A 320 classic was compared in this study. A parametric study on deaerators flow separation and inner geometry was also done in this study. This work also includes a comparison study of different multiphase models and different meshes applied on deaerator numerical test methodology...|$|R
