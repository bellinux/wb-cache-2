5|$|In a later {{version of}} the film, Auto comes to the docking bay to {{retrieve}} EVE's plant. The film would have its first cutaway to the captain, but Stanton moved that as he found it too early to begin moving away from WALL-E's point-of-view. As an homage to Get Smart, Auto takes the plant and goes into {{the bowels of the}} ship into a room resembling a brain where he watches videos of Buy n Large's scheme to clean up the Earth falling apart through the years. Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged; otherwise he would have been unempathetic. One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges Auto. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when <b>he</b> <b>assumes</b> real command of the Axiom.|$|E

5|$|The main villain of Crimson Echoes is King Zeal, revived by Lavos {{through the}} Frozen Flame.

Kasmir is an illusionist who served under Magus in the Mystic War. King Zeal gives him the Masamune, and <b>he</b> <b>assumes</b> leadership of the Mystics after 600A.D. Other foes come from the Reptite timeline, an alternate universe temporarily brought into existence by King Zeal's meddling.

5|$|On 31 October 1517, Luther sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop of Mainz, Albert of Brandenburg, under whose {{authority}} the indulgences were being sold. In the letter, Luther addresses the archbishop out of a loyal desire to alert him to the pastoral problems created by the indulgence sermons. <b>He</b> <b>assumes</b> that Albert is unaware of what is being preached under his authority, and speaks out of concern that the people are being led away from the gospel, and that the indulgence preaching may bring shame to Albert's name. Luther does not condemn indulgences or the current doctrine regarding them, nor even the sermons which had been preached themselves, as he had not seen them firsthand. Instead he states his concern regarding the misunderstandings of the people about indulgences which have been fostered by the preaching, such as the belief that any sin could be forgiven by indulgences or that the guilt as well as the punishment for sin could be forgiven by an indulgence. In a postscript, Luther wrote that Albert could find some theses on the matter enclosed with his letter, so that he could see the uncertainty surrounding the doctrine of indulgences in contrast to the preachers who spoke so confidently of the benefits of indulgences.|$|E
5|$|The War of the Bavarian Succession was {{the last}} war for both Frederick and Maria Theresa, whose reigns began and ended with wars against one another. Although they {{deployed}} armies {{three to four times}} the size of the armies of the Seven Years' War, neither monarch used the entirety of the military force each had at his or her disposal, making this war-without-battles remarkable. Despite the restraint of the monarchs, some early nineteenth-century casualty estimates suggest that tens of thousands died of starvation and hunger-related disease. Carlyle's more moderate estimate lies at about ten thousand Prussian and probably another ten thousand Austrian dead. Michael Hochedlinger assesses combined casualties at approximately thirty thousand; Robert Kann gives no estimate of casualties but suggests the primary causes of death were cholera and dysentery. Gaston Bodart, whose 1915 work is still considered the authority on Austrian military losses, is specific: five Austrian generals (he does not name them), over twelve thousand soldiers, and 74officers died of disease. In minor actions and skirmishes, nine officers and 265men were killed and four officers and 123men were wounded, but not fatally. Sixty-two officers and 2,802men were taken prisoner, and 137men were missing. Over three thousand Imperial soldiers deserted. Finally, twenty-six officers and 372men were discharged with disabilities. Bodart also gives Prussian losses: one general killed (he does not say which), 87officers and 3,364 men killed, wounded or captured. Overall, <b>he</b> <b>assumes</b> losses of ten percent of the fighting force. Little has been discovered of civilian casualties, although certainly the civilians also suffered from starvation and disease. There were other damages: for example, Habelschwerdt and one of its hamlets were destroyed by fire.|$|E

5|$|When Tom goes missing, Darren {{is desperate}} to find him. Thinking that Tom has run away, <b>he</b> <b>assumes</b> {{that he will}} come home if Nancy is there and convinces Sienna to change her {{statement}} about Nancy. Nancy is released from the mental institute because of this. However, it is revealed that Sienna actually kidnapped Tom and kept him hostage in a basement. Tom is able to escape and along with Nancy, they expose Sienna for everything. Sienna attacks Nancy causing her to have temporary brain damage and attempts to kill Tom, Charlie and Oscar although they are saved and Nancy recovers. Following Darren's treatment of Nancy, things are hard between them and get even worse when Nancy attempts to get revenge on Darren. However, they eventually reconcile and get engaged again. However, things only get worse when Sienna blackmails Darren to get Tom to change his statement or she'll create even more problems for the Osbornes. Following a heart attack, Darren is given angina spray however Sienna takes this while Darren is on a camping trip and Nancy leaves him on his own on the trip following an argument. Darren starts {{to have a heart}} attack and Sienna, realizing what she's done, saves him at the last minute.|$|E
5|$|Todd's {{identical}} twin brother, Victor Lord, Jr. (Trevor St. John), {{whom he had}} never known, is physically altered and brainwashed {{to believe that he}} is Todd. From May 2003 to August 2011, <b>he</b> <b>assumes</b> Todd's identity. In 2003, the presumed dead Irene Manning had ordered a hit on the real Todd to keep him from exposing her agency. She had Todd strapped to a chair and made him uncover every detail of his life. She originally gave Victor Todd's scar, but then had Victor's face altered with reconstructive surgery to make him look like Mitch Laurence's long lost brother, Flynn Walker Laurence. Irene sent Victor away in Todd's place, so that he could get his share of the inheritance as Victor Lord Sr.'s heir, and unknowingly help the agency. She kept the real Todd locked up, instead of following through with the original plan to kill him. She eventually admits to these facts after Todd escapes and returns home. Todd struggles with losing eight years of his life, and blames Victor for stealing his children, including the daughter he had with Téa, Danielle (Dani). He plans to kill Victor and is the top suspect when Victor is gunned down. He claims his innocence and convinces Starr to help him escape jail to keep Irene from killing the family for Victor's fortune. Although Irene wounds him, Todd kills her. Téa's brother, Tomás (Ted King), takes credit for allowing a wounded Todd to escape. Todd begins having vivid memories of killing Victor. Before Tomás is sentenced, Todd confesses to Irene's murder; Téa gets the charges reduced to self-defense. Todd locates the gun used to kill Victor and uses it to frame Tomás as revenge for initially bringing him to Irene. Todd and a rogue CIA agent force Tomás into a false confession. Todd faces difficulty bonding with Jack, who only accepts Victor as his father, but he continues to bond with Starr and assists her with various issues. He also helps Cole Thornhart fake his death so he can live with Starr and their daughter, Hope, in California. Todd is later arrested for Victor's murder.|$|E

25|$|Davidson {{argued that}} {{anomalous}} monism follows from three plausible theses. Firstly, <b>he</b> <b>assumes</b> {{the denial of}} epiphenomenalism, the denial of the view that mental events do not cause physical events. Secondly, <b>he</b> <b>assumes</b> a nomological view of causation, according to which one event causes another if (and only if) there is a strict, exceptionless law governing {{the relation between the}} events. Thirdly, <b>he</b> <b>assumes</b> the principle of the anomalism of the mental, according to which there are no strict laws that govern the relationship between mental event types and physical event types. By these the theses, Davidson argued, it follows that the causal relations between the mental and the physical hold only between mental event tokens, but mental events as types are anomalous. That ultimately secures token physicalism and a supervenience relation between the mental and the physical, while respecting the autonomy of the mental (Malpas, 2005, §2).|$|E
