50|$|Although GCI {{began to}} {{supplant}} CHL during 1941 and especially 1942, CHL continued {{to provide an}} important early warning role. In February 1942 the <b>Germans</b> <b>mounted</b> the Channel Dash, moving two of their battleships to harbors in Germany by sailing them right up the English Channel. This major embarrassment was due largely to supremely effective jamming {{on the part of}} the Germans, who managed to render the CH and CHL radars covering the coast entirely ineffective without the operators even noticing.|$|R

50|$|Following {{the joint}} Nazi German and Soviet {{invasion}} of Poland in World War II, on 17-26 September 1939 Krasnobród was {{the location of}} intense fighting between Polish Army Kraków, the Army Lublin, and the German Wehrmacht in the Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski. Polish cavalry of the 25th Greater Poland Uhlan Regiment defeated the <b>German</b> <b>mounted</b> brigade and temporarily re-captured Krasnobród in the Battle of Krasnobród which took place on September 23, 1939.

5000|$|At {{the start}} of Operation Barbarossa, the Germans found Soviet T-34 tanks to be superior, as the German 37 mm Pak36 {{anti-tank}} gun proved incapable of penetrating the T-34's armour. To neutralize the T-34, the <b>Germans</b> <b>mounted</b> a captured Soviet 76.2mm gun on the chassis of the 38(t) model as a stop-gap measure and called it the [...] "Marder III". Crews of early Marder III models fought exposed {{on top of the}} engine deck. Efforts to provide Marder III crews with more protection eventually lead to the tank destroyer Hetzer.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Germans</b> did not <b>mount</b> {{an all-out}} {{infantry}} {{assault on the}} divisional area, which was under continuous mortar and artillery attack. Instead, each sector was subjected to small scale assaults at times supported by tanks or self-propelled guns. Enemy troops first attacked the Independent Company, then the Borders who were forced off the high ground overlooking the river, and finally the KOSB. The <b>Germans</b> <b>mounted</b> a strong assault following the landing of the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade south of the river beside Driel. This attack forced the KOSB out of their positions, which were only regained after a bayonet charge. Fighting was so fierce that first reports suggested the KOSB had been annihilated, although {{it turned out that}} the counter-attack had in fact reduced the battalion's strength to only 150 men.|$|R

25|$|On {{the same}} day, the <b>Germans</b> <b>mounted</b> their final {{attack against the}} Grebbe Line. The stop line, the last resort of the Dutch defenders, {{collapsed}} and the Germans had broken through the Grebbe Line. Isolated pockets of Dutch troops continued to resist, but a nightly attack to dislodge the Germans failed. As there were no reserve troops, {{it was clear that}} defeat was imminent: there was nothing between the Germans and the North Sea but the famous Waterlinie (Water Line), which might have stopped Louis XIV of France in 1672, but was only very sketchily prepared in 1940.|$|R
50|$|Light cavalry {{consisted}} usually of lighter {{armed and}} armoured men, {{who could have}} lances, javelins or missile weapons, such as bows or crossbows. In much of the Middle Ages light cavalry usually consisted of wealthy commoners. Later in the Middle Ages light cavalry would also include sergeants who were men who had trained as knights but could not afford {{the costs associated with}} the title. Light cavalry were used as scouts, skirmishers or outflankers. Many countries developed their own styles of light cavalry, such as Hungarian mounted archers, Spanish jinetes, Italian and <b>German</b> <b>mounted</b> crossbowmen and English currours.|$|R

The telescope is placed {{on one end of}} the declination axis (top left in image), and a suitable counterweight on other end of it (bottom right). The right ascension axis has bearings below the T-joint, that is, it is not supported above the declination axis.|$|R

5000|$|In May, the <b>Germans</b> <b>mounted</b> {{the most}} ambitious raid of all: Operation Rheinübung. The new {{battleship}} [...] and the cruiser [...] put to sea to attack convoys.

Bismarck nearly reached her destination, but was disabled by an airstrike from the carrier , and then sunk by the Home Fleet the next day. Her sinking {{marked the end of}} the warship raids. The advent of long-range search aircraft, notably the unglamorous but versatile PBY Catalina, largely neutralised surface raiders.|$|R
