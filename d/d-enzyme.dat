50|$|Cycloamyloses were {{discovered}} {{as a result}} of studies of the function of 4-α-glucanotransferase, also known as disproportionating enzyme or <b>D-enzyme</b> (EC 2.4.1.25) isolated from potato.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{incubation}} of <b>D-enzyme</b> {{with high}} molecular weight amylose, a product was obtained with decreased ability to form a blue complex with iodine, without reducing or non-reducing ends, and resistant to hydrolysis by glucoamylase (an exoamylase). Takaha and Smith deduced that the product was a cyclic polymer, which they confirmed by mass spectrometry and acid hydrolysis, and showed that it comprised between 17 and several hundred glucose units. It was subsequently shown that <b>D-enzyme</b> could create complex cycloglucans from amylopectin. Similar 4-α-glucanotransferases from bacteria and other organisms have {{also been shown to}} produce cycloglucans upon incubation with amylose or amylopectin.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of glycosyltransferases, {{specifically}} the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,4-alpha-D-glucan:1,4-alpha-D-glucan 4-alpha-D-glycosyltransferase. Other names in common use include disproportionating enzyme, dextrin glycosyltransferase, <b>D-enzyme,</b> debranching enzyme maltodextrin glycosyltransferase, amylomaltase, and dextrin transglycosylase. This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism in plants. Studies of the enzyme from potato led to the discovery of cycloamylose.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the oligosaccharides-exchange dynamics performed by so-called <b>D-enzymes</b> on polysaccharides. To mimic physiological conditions, we treat this process as an open chemical network by assuming {{some of the}} polymer concentrations fixed (chemostatting). We show that three different long-time behaviors may ensue: equilibrium states, nonequilibrium steady states, and continuous growth states. We dynamically and thermodynamically characterize these states and emphasize the crucial role of conservation laws in identifying the chemostatting conditions inducing them.

50|$|When {{placed in}} a nonchiral solvent like water, D-peptides, {{as well as the}} larger {{polypeptide}} D-proteins, have similar but mirrored properties to the L-peptides and L-proteinswith identical sequences. If an L-protein does not require a Chaperone or a structural cofactor to fold, itsD-enantiomer protein should have a mirror image conformation with respect to the L-protein (Figure 1). A <b>D-enzyme</b> should act on substrates of reverse chirality compared to the L-enzyme with the same sequence. Similarly, if an L-peptide binds to an L-protein, their D-peptide and D-protein counterpartsshould bind together in a mirrored way.|$|E
40|$|Pea (Pisum sativum L.) {{chloroplast}} <b>D-enzyme</b> (4 -α-d-glucanotransferase, EC 2. 4. 1. 25) was purified {{greater than}} 750 -fold and partially characterized. It is a dimer with a subunit Mr of ca. 50, 000. Optimal activity is between pH 7. 5 and 8. 0 with maltotriose as substrate and the enzyme's Km for maltotriose is 3. 3 millimolar. Chloroplast <b>D-enzyme</b> converts maltotriose to maltopentaose and glucose via {{the exchange of}} α- 1, 4 -glycosidic linkages. Maltotriose acts either as a donor or acceptor of a maltosyl group. The enzyme has highest activity with maltotriose as substrate. As initial substrate degree of polymerization is increased to maltoheptaose, <b>D-enzyme</b> activity drops to zero at 10 millimolar substrate concentrations and by 70 % at 1 millimolar concentrations. The enzyme cannot use maltose as a substrate. Glucose {{was found to be}} a suitable acceptor substrate for this <b>D-enzyme.</b> Addition of glucose to incubation mixtures, or production of glucose by <b>D-enzyme,</b> prevents the synthesis of maltodextrins larger than maltopentaose. Removal of glucose produced by <b>D-enzyme</b> activity with maltotriose as substrate resulted in the synthesis of maltopentaose and maltodextrins with sufficient degrees of polymerization to be suitable substrates for pea chloroplast starch phosphorylase. The possible role of <b>D-enzyme</b> in pea chloroplast starch metabolism is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Two major {{forms of}} <b>d-enzyme</b> (4 -α-glucanotransferase, EC 2. 4. 1. 25) were {{successfully}} separated {{from most of}} the amylase activity using FPLC-Mono Q column chromatography. Transfer of a maltosyl group was observed upon the incubation of <b>d-enzyme</b> with maltotriose and d-[U- 14 C]glucose. About 4. 5 % of the radioactivity was transferred to maltotriose in 2 hours. End product analysis showed the accumulation of glucose and maltopentaose from maltotriose within the first 10 minutes of the reaction. Several other maltodextrins were also observed with longer incubation times, although maltose was never produced. A quantitative measurement of maltodextrin production from the reaction of [14 C]maltotriose with <b>d-enzyme</b> showed that the quantity of maltotriose decreased from 100 % to 31 % after 3 hours incubation, while glucose, maltotetraose, maltopentaose, maltohexaose, maltoheptaose, maltooctaose, and higher maltodextrins increased in amount. Glucose is the major product throughout the course of the reaction of <b>d-enzyme</b> with maltotriose. Maltotriose, in addition to glucose, are the major products in the reaction of <b>d-enzyme</b> with maltodextrins with a chain length greater than maltotriose. This study confirms the existence of a transglycosylase that disproportionates maltotriose and higher maltodextrins by transferring maltosyl or maltodextrinyl groups between maltodextrins resulting in the production of glucose and different maltodextrins, but not maltose, in leaf tissue with enzymic properties very similar to the previously reported <b>d-enzyme</b> in potato...|$|E
40|$|In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the {{presence}} of a defective STA 11 locus results in significantly reduced granular starch deposition displaying major modifications in shape and structure. This defect simultaneously leads to the accumulation of linear malto-oligosaccharides (MOS). The mutants of STA 11 were showed to lack <b>D-enzyme,</b> a plant alpha- 1, 4 glucanotransferase analogous to the Escherichia coli amylomaltase. We have cloned and characterized both the cDNA and gDNA corresponding to the C. reinhardtii <b>D-enzyme.</b> We now report allele-specific modifications of the <b>D-enzyme</b> gene in the mutants of STA 11. These allele-specific modifications cosegregate with the corresponding sta 11 mutations, thereby demonstrating that STA 11 encodes <b>D-enzyme.</b> MOS production and starch accumulation were investigated during day and night cycles in wild-type and mutant C. reinhardtii cells. We demonstrate that in the algae MOS are produced during starch biosynthesis and degraded during the phases of net polysaccharide catabolism...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel mutation in the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii STA 11 gene, {{which results in}} significantly reduced granular starch deposition and major modifications in amylopectin structure and granule shape. This defect simultaneously leads to the accumulation of linear malto-oligosaccharides. The sta 11 - 1 mutation causes {{the absence of an}} alpha- 1, 4 glucanotransferase known as disproportionating enzyme (<b>D-enzyme).</b> <b>D-enzyme</b> activity was found to be correlated with the amount of wild-type allele doses in gene dosage experiments. All other enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis, including ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, debranching enzymes, soluble and granule-bound starch synthases, branching enzymes, phosphorylases, alpha-glucosidases (maltases), and amylases, were unaffected by the mutation. These data indicate that the <b>D-enzyme</b> is required for normal starch granule biogenesis in the monocellular alga C. reinhardtii...|$|E
40|$|The {{amylomaltase}} gene of the {{thermophilic bacterium}} Thermus aquaticus ATCC 33923 was cloned and sequenced. The {{open reading frame}} of this gene consisted of 1, 503 nucleotides and encoded a polypeptide that was 500 amino acids long and had a calculated molecular mass of 57, 221 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of the amylomaltase exhibited {{a high level of}} homology with the amino acid sequence of potato disproportionating enzyme (<b>D-enzyme)</b> (41 %) but a low level of homology with the amino acid sequence of the Escherichia coli amylomaltase (19 %). The amylomaltase gene was overexpressed in E. coli, and the enzyme was purified. This enzyme exhibited maximum activity at 75 °C in a 10 -min reaction with maltotriose and was stable at temperatures up to 85 °C. When the enzyme acted on amylose, it catalyzed an intramolecular transglycosylation (cyclization) reaction which produced cyclic α- 1, 4 -glucan (cycloamylose), like potato <b>D-enzyme.</b> The yield of cycloamylose produced from synthetic amylose with an average molecular mass of 110 kDa was 84 %. However, the minimum degree of polymerization (DP) of the cycloamylose produced by T. aquaticus enzyme was 22, whereas the minimum DP of the cycloamylose produced by potato <b>D-enzyme</b> was 17. The T. aquaticus enzyme also catalyzed intermolecular transglycosylation of maltooligosaccharides. A detailed analysis of the activity of T. aquaticus ATCC 33923 amylomaltase with maltooligosaccharides indicated that the catalytic properties of this enzyme differ from those of E. coli amylomaltase and the plant <b>D-enzyme...</b>|$|E
40|$|Plant alpha- 1, 4 glucano{{transfer}}ases (disproportionating enzymes, or D-enzymes) transfer glucan chains among oligosaccharides {{with the}} concomitant release of glucose (Glc). Analysis of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii sta 11 - 1 mutants revealed {{a correlation between}} a <b>D-enzyme</b> deficiency and specific alterations in amylopectin structure and starch biosynthesis, thereby suggesting previously unknown biosynthetic functions. This study characterized the biochemical activities of the alpha- 1, 4 glucanotransferase that is deficient in sta 11 - 1 mutants. The enzyme exhibited the glucan transfer and Glc production activities that define D-enzymes. <b>D-enzyme</b> also transferred glucans among the outer chains of amylopectin (using the polysaccharide chains as both donor and acceptor) and from malto-oligosaccharides into the outer chains of either amylopectin or glycogen. In contrast to transfer among oligosaccharides, which occurs readily with maltotriose, transfer into polysaccharide required longer donor molecules. All three enzymatic activities, evolution of Glc from oligosaccharides, glucan transfer from oligosaccharides into polysaccharides, and transfer among polysaccharide outer chains, were evident in a single 62 -kD band. Absence of all three activities co-segregated with the sta 11 - 1 mutation, which is known to cause abnormal accumulation of oligosaccharides {{at the expense of}} starch. To explain these data we propose that D-enzymes function directly in building the amylopectin structure...|$|E
40|$|Amylolytic enzymes of Arabidopsis leaf tissue were {{partially}} purified and characterized. Endoamylase, starch phosphorylase, <b>d-enzyme</b> (transglycosylase), {{and possibly}} exoamylase {{were found in}} the chloroplasts. Endoamylase, fraction A 2, found only in the chloroplast, was resolved from the exoamylases by chromatography on a Mono Q column and migrated with an RF of 0. 44 on 7 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Exoamylase fraction, A 1, has an RF of 0. 23 on the polyacrylamide gel. Viscometric analysis showed that A 1 has a slope of 0. 013, which is same as that of A 3, the extrachloroplastic amylase. A 1, however, can be distinguished from A 3 by having much higher amylolytic activity in succinate buffer than acetate buffer, and having much less reactivity with amylose. A 1 probably is also localized in the chloroplast, and contributes to the 30 to 40 % higher amylolytic activity of the chloroplast preparation in succinate than acetate buffer at pH 6. 0. The high activity of <b>d-enzyme</b> compared to the amylolytic activity in the chloroplast suggests that transglycosylation probably has an important role during starch degradation in Arabidopsis leaf. Extrachloroplastic amylase, A 3, has an RF of 0. 55 on 7 % electrophoretic gel and constitutes 80 % of the total leaf amylolytic activity. The results of substrate specificity studies, action pattern and viscometric analyses indicate that the extrachloroplastic amylases are exolytic...|$|E
40|$|Leuconostoc mesenteroides {{increased}} its lactic acid production from glucose threefold when malic acid {{was added to}} the culture. This increase resulted also in a reduction of the ratio of d-lactic acid to l-lactic acid (31. 5 to 1. 23). Addition of malic acid increased 6. 5 -fold the specific activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) -linked l-lactate dehydrogenase and increased 3. 2 -fold that of NAD-linked d-lactate dehydrogenase. The Michaelis constant (Km) for NAD of the NAD-linked l-lactate dehydrogenase increased with the addition of malate, but no change was observed in the Km values for the respective <b>d-enzyme.</b> The effect of carboxylic acids on the NAD-linked l-lactate dehydrogenase activities was tested by using partially purified enzyme preparations from cells grown with glucose alone and from cells grown with glucose plus malate. Malate stimulated the l-enzyme and inhibited the d-lactate dehydrogenase. The NAD-linked l-lactate dehydrogenase exhibited the same activity bands on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis whether the cell-free preparation originated from cells grown on glucose plus malate or on glucose as the sole carbon source. The NAD-linked d-lactate dehydrogenase, however, exhibited a different pattern of electrophoretic mobility, depending upon the source of origin of the cell-free preparation. The results suggest that malate has a stimulatory effect on the synthesis of both enzymes and may result in rearrangement of the protein structure of the d-lactate dehydrogenase. This rearrangement apparently makes the <b>d-enzyme</b> more susceptible to inhibition of catalytic activity. The l-lactate dehydrogenase, however, is stimulated not only in its synthesis but also in its activity. It is proposed that these effects are responsible for the regulation of lactic acid production...|$|E
40|$|Starch {{content of}} leaves {{responds}} to environmental stresses in various ways. Understanding these environmental effects on starch metabolism {{has been difficult}} in the past because the pathways of transitory starch synthesis and degradation are not completely known. Over {{the past two years}} there has been a significant increase in our understanding of tran-sitory starch breakdown. The discovery of a maltose transporter (MEX 1) and the studies of a cytosolic disproportionating enzyme (<b>D-enzyme,</b> DPE 2) confirmed that maltose is the predominant form of carbon exported from chloroplasts at night. Maltose increases in leaves when starch breakdown is induced during the day under photo-respiratory conditions. Maltose metabolism is regulated by a circadian clock, day length and temperature. The expres-sion of maltose-metabolizing genes shows a pronounced circadian rhythm indicating maltose metabolism is clock regulated. Indeed, the maltose level oscillates under con-tinuous light. The transcript of...|$|E
40|$|Amylomaltases or <b>D-enzyme</b> (4 -alpha-glucanotransferases; E. C. 2. 4. 1. 25) are carbohydrate-active {{enzymes that}} {{catalyze}} {{the transfer of}} glucan units from one a-glucan to another in a disproportionation reaction. These enzymes are involved in starch metabolism in plants or maltose/glycogen metabolism in many microorganisms. The amylomaltase of the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB 8 was overproduced in Escherichia coli, partially purified and used to modify potato starch. The action of amylomaltase caused the disappearance of amylose and the broadening of the side-chain length distribution in amylopectin, {{which resulted in a}} product with both shorter and longer side chains than in the parent starch. Amylomaltase-treated potato starch showed thermoreversible gelation at concentrations of 3 % (w/v) or more, thus making it comparable to gelatin. Because of its animal origin, gelatin is not accepted by several consumer groups. Therefore, the amylomaltase-treated potato starch might be a good plant-derived substitute for gelatin...|$|E
40|$|The {{subcellular}} localization of the starch biosynthetic and degradative enzymes of spinach leaves {{was carried}} out by measuring the distribution of the enzymes in a crude chloroplast pellet and soluble protein fraction, and by the separation on sucrose density gradients of intact organelles, chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and mitochondria of a protoplast lysate. ADP-Glucose pyrophosphorylase, starch synthase, and starch-branching enzymes are quantitatively associated with the chloroplasts. The starch degradative enzymes amylase, R-enzyme (debranching activity), phosphorylase, and <b>D-enzyme</b> (transglycosylase) are observed both in the chloroplast and soluble protein fractions, the bulk of the degradative enzyme activities reside in the latter fraction. Chromatography of a chloroplast extract on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose resolves the R- and D-enzymes from amylase and phosphorylase activities although the two latter enzyme activities coeluted. The digestion pattern of amylase with amylopectin as a substrate indicates an endolytic activity but displays properties unlike the typical α-amylase as isolated from endosperm tissue...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{identify}} enzymes that participate in the degradation of transitory starch in Arabidopsis. A mutant line was isolated by screening leaves {{at the end of}} the night for the presence of starch. The mutant had a higher starch content than the wild-type throughout the diurnal cycle. This accumulation was due to a reduction in starch breakdown, leading to an imbalance between the rates of synthesis and degradation. No reduction in the activity of endo-amylase (α-amylase), β-amylase, starch phosphorylase, maltase, pullulanase or <b>D-enzyme</b> could be detected in crude extracts of leaves of the mutant. However, native PAGE in gels containing amylopectin revealed that a starch-hydrolysing activity, putatively identified as an endo-amylase and present in wild-type chloroplasts, was absent or appreciably reduced in the mutant. This is the first time that a specific enzyme required for starch degradation has been identified in leaves...|$|E
40|$|Mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. with altered {{regulation}} of starch degradation {{were identified by}} screening for plants that retained high levels of leaf starch {{after a period of}} extended darkness. The mutant phenotype was also expressed in seeds, flowers, and roots, indicating that the same pathway of starch degradation is used in these tissues. In many respects, the physiological consequences of the mutations were equivalent to the effects observed in previously characterized mutants of Arabidopsis that are unable to synthesize starch. One mutant line, which was characterized in detail, had normal levels of activity of the starch degradative enzymes α-amylase, β-amylase, phosphorylase, <b>D-enzyme,</b> and debranching enzyme. Thus, {{it was not possible to}} establish a biochemical basis for the phenotype, which was due to a recessive mutation at a locus designated sex 1 at position 12. 2 on chromosome 1. This raises the possibility that hitherto unidentified factors, altered by the mutation, play a key role in regulating or catalyzing starch degradation...|$|E
