5|$|The Degrassi {{universe}} {{was created in}} 1979 by Playing With Time, a production company owned by former school teacher Linda Schuyler and her partner Kit Hood. The franchise began with The <b>Kids</b> <b>of</b> Degrassi Street, which was spawned out of three half-hour short films.

5|$|Degrassi: The Next Generation (later renamed Degrassi for seasons ten through fourteen) is a Canadian teen drama {{television}} series {{set in the}} Degrassi universe, which was created by Linda Schuyler and Kit Hood in 1979. It is the fourth series in the Degrassi franchise, following The <b>Kids</b> <b>of</b> Degrassi Street, Degrassi Junior High, and Degrassi High. Like its predecessors, the series follows an ensemble cast of students at the fictional Degrassi Community School who face various challenges often seen as taboo such as graffiti, sex, teen pregnancy, bullying, date rape, drug abuse, self image, homosexuality, self-injury, suicide, abortion, domestic violence, death, racism and many other issues.|$|E
5|$|Linda Schuyler had co-created The <b>Kids</b> <b>of</b> Degrassi Street in 1979 with Kit Hood, and Yan Moore was {{a writer}} on that series. As the {{children}} grew up, the Degrassi franchise developed into Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High. In 1999 two episodes of Jonovision, a CBC Television talk show aimed at teenagers, reunited some of the cast members from the series. At the same time, Schuyler and Moore were developing a new television drama. When the Jonovision reunion episode proved to be popular, Schuyler and Moore wondered about reuniting the characters, too. As the months passed, they began thinking about {{what might have happened}} to the characters of Degrassi High and realized that the character Emma Nelson, born at the end of Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon be entering junior high school. Stephen Stohn, Schuyler's husband suggested Degrassi: The Next Generation as the name for the new sequel series, borrowing the concept from , of which he was a fan.|$|E

25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed.

Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E

Average age of goats at first mating was 242 days, and first kidding 398, 1 days.

Number <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> in litter varied from 1 to 4, and in average it was 1, 96 <b>kids.</b> Average mass <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> at birth was 3, 38 and differed significantly {{depending on the}} sex, type of birth and order <b>of</b> <b>kidding</b> (parity), whereas the mass <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> at weaning was 18, 39 kg and was {{under the influence of}} sex and type of birth.
