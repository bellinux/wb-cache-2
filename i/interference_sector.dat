The edge allocation algorithm assigns subcarriers to the sectors considering both the channel state information and the load conditions. By borrowing subcarriers from center group or other sectors, the edge users can obtain a better gain than the static FFR scheme. Furthermore, the dynamically distribution can effectively avoid the ICI by scheduling subcarriers with <b>interference</b> coordination between <b>sectors</b> and also improve the edge-cell performance.

40|$|Inter-cell {{interference}} (ICI) is {{the main}} factor affecting system capacity and spectral efficiency. Effective spectrum resource management is an important and challenging issue {{for the design of}} wireless communication systems. The soft frequency reuse (SFR) is regarded as an interesting approach to significantly eliminate ICI. However, the allocation of resource is fixed prior to system deployment in static SFR. To overcome this drawback, this paper adopts a distributed method and proposes an improved dynamic joint resource allocation algorithm (DJRA). The improved scheme adaptively adjusts resource allocation based on the real-time user distribution. DJRA first detects the edge-user distribution vector to determine the optimal scheme, which guarantees that all the users have available resources and the number of iterations is reduced. Then, the DJRA maximizes the throughput for each cell via optimizing resource and power allocation. Due to further eliminate <b>interference,</b> the <b>sector</b> partition method is used in the center region and in view of fairness among users, the novel approach adds the proportional fair algorithm at the end of DJRA. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms previous approaches for improving the system capacity and cell edge user performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The use of {{statistical}} eigen-beamforming {{is effective in}} spatially correlated fading environments, but it may suffer from <b>interference</b> near the <b>sector</b> boundary when applied to the downlink with universal frequency reuse. This interference effect may not sufficiently be handled by a {{minimum mean square error}} (MMSE) receiver unless a sufficient number of receive antennas are employed. In this paper, we consider the use of multi-sector beamforming that cooperates with a neighboring sector in the same cell to mitigate this interference problem. By exploiting long-term channel state information (CSI), the proposed scheme can obtain transmit array gain without the use of instantaneous CSI, while avoiding interference from the adjacent cooperating sector. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed with combined use of an MMSE receiver and verified by computer simulation. Keywords-beamforming; interference; multi-sector; correlation I...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about packet {{scheduling}} in wireless networks. We considered a broadband cellular {{fixed wireless access}} network with an aggressive channel reuse of 1 (more specifically, the reuse is 1 / 6 as each cell is composed of 6 <b>sectors).</b> Certain <b>interference</b> management/avoidance techniques have to be used when such an aggressive channel reuse scheme is employed. Towards that end, a number of packet scheduling schemes based on inter-base station (and thus, inter-sector) coordination have been proposed in the literature in recent years. One recent study [23] proposes a dynamic time slot allocation scheme which avoids concurrent transmissions in “interference groups ” (the interference group for a sector is composed of those sectors which cause the most <b>interference</b> to the <b>sector</b> at hand). In this thesis, we have first refined the scheduling discipline proposed in [23] in various ways, most notably by incorporating adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) to improve the throughput; we refer to this case as the IIS-AMC-ST (intra and inter-sector scheduling with adaptive modulation and coding: single transmission) scheme.

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of the Higgs signal within the MSSM requires precise theoretical predictions including mixing and higher-order effects. In case of nearby resonances in the Higgs <b>sector,</b> <b>interference</b> effects may be relevant. However, the interference term is neglected by the standard “narrow-width approximation” (NWA), which is in other respects a convenient tool for the factorisation of a more complicated process into production and subsequent decay of a particle with a small width compared to its mass. Hence, a generalisation of the usual NWA is analysed which allows for a consistent treatment of interference effects between nearly mass-degenerate particles. This can be useful for the application to processes for which the factorisation into different sub-processes is essential to enable the computation of higher-order contributions. Phenomenological consequences of interference effects between neutral MSSM Higgs bosons will be presented for an example process of Higgs boson production and its subsequent decay including one-loop corrections. As {{a test of the}} interference- and higher-order-improved NWA, the factorised approximation will be compared to the calculation of the full process at the one-loop level. Furthermore, the Breit-Wigner approximation will be validated in comparison to the full Higgs propagator mixing. ...|$|R

Several new antennas have been developed and assessed for their suitable application to RoF systems. The antennas were: (i) a multiband PIFA developed previously in the ROSETTE project and modified here to exhibit an improved match when integrated with a ground plane for ceiling mounting. (ii) A cost effective microstrip array directive antenna for street illumination in the Manhattan Scenario. Beam coverage was controlled by electronic shaping and mechanical tilting. (iii) A new compact PIFA design for use in mobile equipment or sectorized base stations where a slotted structure is used to achieve a sharp edge defined operating bandwidth which allows the antenna to act as a filter, thus reducing component count and insertion loss in the transceiver front end. The antenna has been integrated with a larger handset sized ground plane and its insensitivity to this mounting has been demonstrated. (iv) the antenna in (iii) has been implemented in a 3 <b>sector</b> cluster and <b>interference</b> between <b>sector</b> beams by pattern overlap has been characterized. (v) A new compact PIFA working in the 3 - 5 GHz sub-bands of the FCC UWB band has been described and demonstrated to offer useful performance and exhi bit a useful band pass fil tering characteristic reducing the need for a frontend filter in UW 8 systems. (vi) A size reduced PIFA has been presented and studied where the rear ground plane was replaced by a strip element FSS tuned to 450 Hz. This was demonstrated to improve performance at that band and the antenna was shown to offer a gain that compared well to a standard PlFA between I and 100 Hz. The work described has been undertaken over 3 EU funded projects and the thesis begins with a brief overview of the relevant parts of those projects, particularly how antenna match is of importance at the Remote Antenna Unit of a Radio-over-Fibre system as poor input isolation and reflection can cause ringing in the bidirectional amplifiers associated with the duplex transmission. The new antennas developed for application in mobile equipment are shown to be compact (in relation to electrical size) and are considered in terms of their input bandwidth and efficiency.

40|$|Introduction: Generating country-level {{political}} commitment {{will be critical}} to driving forward action throughoutthe United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016 - 2025). In this review of the empirical nutrition policy literature we ask: what factors generate, sustain and constrain {{political commitment}} for nutrition, how, and under what circumstances? Our aim is to inform strategic ‘commitment-building’ actions. Method: We adopted a framework synthesis method and realist review protocol. An initial framework was derived from relevant theory and then populated with empirical evidence to test and modify it. Five steps were undertaken: initial theoretical framework development; search for relevant empirical literature; study selection and quality appraisal; data extraction, analysis and synthesis; and framework modification. Results: 75 studies were included. We identified 18 factors that drive commitment, organized into five categories: actors; institutions; political and societal contexts; knowledge, evidence and framing; and capacities and resources. Irrespective of country-context, effective nutrition actor networks, strong leadership, civil society mobilization, supportive political administrations, societal change and focusing events, cohesive and resonant framing, and robust data systems and available evidence, were commitment drivers. Low and middle-income country studies also frequently reported international actors, empowered institutions, vertical coordination, and capacities and resources. In upper-middle and high-income country studies private <b>sector</b> <b>interference</b> frequently undermined commitment. Conclusion: Political commitment {{is not something that}} simply exists or emerges accidentally; it can be created and strengthened over time through strategic action. Successfully generating commitment will likely require a ‘core set’ of actions with some context-dependent adaptations. Ultimately, it will necessitate strategic actions by cohesive, resourced and strongly-led nutrition actor networks that are responsive to the multi-factorial, multi-level and dynamic political systems in which they operate and attempt to influence. Accelerating the formation and effectiveness of such networks over the Nutrition Decade should be a core task for all actors involved...|$|R
