5|$|Statistics {{regarding}} {{crime rates}} in the Bay Area generally fall into two categories: violent crime and property crime. Historically, violent crime has been concentrated in a few cities in the East Bay, namely Oakland, Richmond, and Antioch, but also <b>East</b> <b>Palo</b> Alto in the Peninsula, Vallejo in the North Bay, and San Francisco. Nationally, Oakland's murder rate ranked 18th among cities with over 100,000 residents, and third for violent crimes per capita. According to a 2015 Federal Bureau of Investigation report, Oakland was also {{the source of the}} most violent crime in the Bay Area, with 16.9 reported incidents per thousand people. Vallejo came in second, at 8.7 incidents per thousand people, while San Pablo, Antioch, and San Francisco rounded out the top five. <b>East</b> <b>Palo</b> Alto, which used to have the Bay Area's highest murder rate, saw violent crime incidents drop 65% between 2013 and 2014, while Oakland saw violent crime incidents drop 15%. Meanwhile, San Jose, {{which was one of the}} safest large cities in the United States in the early 2000s, has seen its violent crime rates trend upwards. Cities with the lowest rate of violent crime include the Peninsula cities of Los Altos and Foster City, East Bay cities of San Ramon and Danville, and South Bay cities of Saratoga and Cupertino. In 2015, 45 Bay Area cities counted zero homicides, the largest of which was Daly City.|$|E
5|$|The Asian American {{population}} in the Bay Area is significant compared to other regions in the U.S., concentrated in the Bay Area city of Daly City. At 58.4%, Daly City's Asian American population is larger {{than anywhere else in}} the United States outside of Hawaii. Asian Americans also constitute a majority in Fremont, with significant populations in Sunnyvale and Santa Clara. The cities of San Jose and San Francisco had the third and fourth largest total number of Asian Americans out of every American city. In San Francisco, Chinese Americans constitute 21.4% of the population and constitute the single largest ethnic group in the city. Santa Clara county, and increasingly the East Bay, house a significant Indian American community. The Bay Area is home to over 382,950 Filipino Americans, one of the largest communities of Filipino people outside of the Philippines with the largest proportion of Filipino Americans concentrating themselves within American Canyon, Daly City, Fairfield, South San Francisco and Vallejo. There are more than 100,000 people of Vietnamese ancestry residing within San Jose city limits, the largest Vietnamese population of any city in the world outside of Vietnam. In addition, there is a sizable community of Korean Americans in Santa Clara county, where San Jose is located. East Bay cities such as Richmond and Oakland, and the North Bay city of Santa Rosa, have plentiful populations of Laotian and Cambodians in certain neighborhoods. Pacific Islanders such as Samoans and Tongans have the largest presence in <b>East</b> <b>Palo</b> Alto, where they constitute over 7% of the population.|$|E

25|$|The {{prosperity}} that {{benefited the}} Silicon Valley during the dot-com {{boom of the}} late 1990s largely bypassed <b>East</b> <b>Palo</b> Alto. The Ravenswood City School District, which serves <b>East</b> <b>Palo</b> Alto and part of adjoining Menlo Park, has struggled with low academic performance. Eventually, however, the Peninsula's shortage of land and soaring property prices meant that even <b>East</b> <b>Palo</b> Alto became an option for urban regeneration. Until recently, gentrification has been rare in <b>East</b> <b>Palo</b> Alto.|$|E

25|$|The Sequoia Union High School District {{operates}} the zoned {{high schools in}} the area. Between 1958 and 1976 <b>East</b> <b>Palo</b> Alto had its own high school, Ravenswood High School. After the school was closed because of low enrollment, the building was demolished in 1995 {{to make room for the}} Gateway 101 Shopping Center. Following the closure of Ravenswood High School, <b>East</b> <b>Palo</b> Alto's high school students were bused out of the city to other schools in the region, primarily Carlmont High School in Belmont. Some have called for re-opening Ravenswood High School in a new location in <b>East</b> <b>Palo</b> Alto.|$|E

25|$|In the past, <b>East</b> <b>Palo</b> Alto {{experienced}} profound {{crime and}} poverty, {{especially during the}} 1980s and early 1990s. In 1992, it had the highest homicide rate {{in the country with}} 24,322 people, and 42 murders, equaling a rate of 172.7 homicides per 100,000 residents.

25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I, {{the north side of}} <b>East</b> <b>Palo</b> Alto became a military training ground, of which only the Veteran's Administration Hospital in Menlo Park still exists. In the 1940s, <b>East</b> <b>Palo</b> Alto was a farming community with many Japanese residents. During the war, the Japanese were forced out, many to relocation centers, and did not return after the war. In the 1950s the farms were built over with cheap housing and many African-American families moved in. During the civil rights movement of the 1960s there was a renewed interest in African history, one expression of which was a fad for Swahili. In 1968 the area was almost renamed Nairobi, after the center of the Swahili-speaking area, to reflect the population's African roots. Critics of the change pointed out that Nairobi was the capital of Kenya, in East Africa, and {{had little to do with}} the cultural roots of most black Americans. In the end, the change was not made.|$|E
25|$|When {{the current}} bridge was planned in the 1970s, Caltrans {{conducted}} extensive environmental {{research on the}} aquatic and terrestrial environment. Principal concerns of the public were air pollution and noise pollution impacts, particularly in some residential areas of Menlo Park and <b>East</b> <b>Palo</b> Alto. Studies were conducted to produce contour maps of projected sound levels and carbon monoxide concentrations throughout the western approaches, for each alternative connection scheme.|$|E

50|$|Long Beach's {{geographic}} location directly <b>east</b> of the <b>Palos</b> Verdes Peninsula, paired with its mostly south facing coastline, {{results in the}} city having significantly different weather patterns than coastal communities {{to the north and}} south.
