5|$|In 1823, Anning {{discovered}} a second, much more complete plesiosaur skeleton, specimen BMNH 22656. When Conybeare presented {{his analysis of}} plesiosaur anatomy to {{a meeting of the}} Geological Society in 1824, he again <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> Anning by name, even though she had possibly collected both skeletons and she had made the sketch of the second skeleton he used in his presentation. Conybeare's presentation was made at the same meeting at which William Buckland described the dinosaur Megalosaurus and the combination created a sensation in scientific circles. The second fossil was named and described as Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus and is the type specimen (holotype) of this species, which itself is the type species of the genus.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, {{both the}} piano version and the orchestral version were published. The first edition was a piano version by the Brandis & Dufour {{who made it}} {{available}} {{on the day of}} the premiere, based on Rossini's piano version but reduced to only one piano, also cutting passages. It was soon followed by editions from Chappell in London, Ricordi in Milan, and Oliver Ditson in Boston, somewhat later by B. Schotts Söhne. These four prints have in common that they were settings for harmonium and only one piano. Ricordi published a piano reduction of the orchestral score rather than following Rossini's original piano version. Some versions <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> that Rossini intended the work to be accompanied by two pianos.|$|E
5|$|Leaving {{a bowling}} alley, student Taylor Watts (Jacinda Barrett) is {{abducted}} by two men. As she is dragged into a car, her dropped purse shows {{that her father}} is Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn). Watts is then seen briefing Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents on the kidnapping, as a witness describes one abductor, who was wearing a mask like those issued to U.S. troops in the Gulf War. FBI agent Emma Hollis (Klea Scott) remarks to the agents that Watts <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> of the Millennium Group or those opposed to it in his briefing, and that her partner Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), who has been investigating the Group, is absent.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary written sources about Mindaugas {{are very}} scarce. Much {{what is known}} about his reign is {{obtained}} from the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle and the Hypatian Codex. Both of these chronicles were produced by enemies of Lithuania and thus have anti-Lithuanian bias, particularly the Hypatian Codex. They are also incomplete: both of them lack dates and locations even for the most important events. For example, the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle devoted 125 poetry lines to Mindaugas's coronation, but <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> either the date or the location. Other important sources are the papal bulls regarding baptism and coronation of Mindaugas. The Lithuanians did not produce any surviving records themselves, except for a series of acts granting lands to the Livonian Order, but their authenticity is disputed. Due to lack of sources, some important questions regarding Mindaugas and his reign cannot be answered.|$|E
5|$|In the American camp, {{the mutual}} resentment between Horatio Gates and Benedict Arnold finally {{exploded}} into open hostility. Gates quickly reported {{the action of}} September 19 to the Congress and Governor George Clinton of New York, but he <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> Arnold at all. The field commanders and men universally credited Arnold for their success. Almost all the troops involved were from Arnold's command and Arnold was the one directing the battle while Gates sat in his tent. Arnold protested, and the dispute escalated into a shouting match that ended with Gates relieving Arnold of his command and giving it to Benjamin Lincoln. Arnold asked for a transfer to Washington's command, which Gates granted, but instead of leaving he remained in his tent. There is no documentary evidence for a commonly recounted anecdote that a petition signed by line officers convinced Arnold to stay in camp.|$|E
5|$|The Ellesmere Canal {{company had}} been {{constructing}} canals to the west, linking Llangollen to Frankton, but the route from there to Chester had not been decided. In 1796, they obtained an Act of Parliament, authorising a line from near the great aqueduct at Pontcysyllte running roughly northwards through Ruabon, Bersham, Gwersyllt and Pulford to join the River Dee opposite the canal basin at Chester. The Chester company, {{who were trying to}} put their financial affairs into order, noticed that the 1796 Act <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> a connection with their canal. They decided to obtain an Act to enforce a connection, and to stop supplying water to the Wirral line. The Ellesmere company responded quickly, agreeing to make changes to their Act, and the Chester company continued to supply water. On the strength of this, they were also able to raise some money to put the canal into good order and to repay some of their debts. The Ellesmere company extended their canal eastwards from Frankton to Whitchurch, and in 1802, the two companies reached agreement on a line from near Whitchurch to Hurleston Junction, just to the north of Nantwich. It opened on 25 March 1805, and water supply was enhanced by the construction of a navigable feeder through Llangollen to Horseshoe Falls on the River Dee at Llantisilio.|$|E

25|$|At the hearing, held before {{magistrate}} Dennis Beutel, the Tomkins {{pleaded guilty}} to common assault. The prosecutor representing the four Toomelah boys did not produce photographs of the boys' injuries nor use their testimonies, according to Jarrett. The prosecutor also <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> the drugs on the Tomkins' property.|$|E
25|$|Other reports, however, <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> Willard {{suffered}} {{any real}} injuries. The New York Times {{account of the}} fight described severe swelling visible {{on one side of}} Willard's face, but did not mention any broken bones. A still photograph of Willard following the fight appears to show discoloration and swelling on his face.|$|E
25|$|The Health Authority {{was unable}} {{to show that there}} were {{overriding}} public interest considerations which warranted a departure from the promise. The Court also took into account the fact that the Authority had <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> any alternative accommodation to be offered to the applicant. Thus, it concluded that the decision to close Mardon House constituted unfairness amounting to an abuse of power.|$|E

25|$|Hogg {{was careful}} not to divulge {{potentially}} embarrassing information about Shelley's living friends, however. He also <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> his own passion for Harriet Shelley, Percy Shelley's first wife. Harriet was portrayed very favourably in the book, although Hogg did discuss her preoccupation with suicide. Percy's father Timothy Shelley was portrayed very negatively, and the book characterized Percy Shelley as often disdainful towards his parents.|$|E
25|$|From 1915 to 1918, Kurds {{struggled}} to end Ottoman rule over their region. They were encouraged by Woodrow Wilson's support for non-Turkish nationalities {{of the empire}} and submitted their claim for independence to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. The Treaty of Sèvres stipulated {{the creation of an}} autonomous Kurdish state in 1920, but the subsequent Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> Kurds. In 1925 and 1930, Kurdish revolts were forcibly suppressed.|$|E
25|$|In his 2008 {{review of}} the volume, Săndulescu noted that the text omitted {{important}} details from its author's life. Given the date of completion, he describes as understandable that Cioculescu <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> facts about his anti-communist brother and his death in confinement, and believes it natural that the book does not include any detail about the critic's own affiliation with the anti-communist Dreptatea. However, he sees a bizarre tendency in that Amintiri skips over Cioculescu's time in Paris.|$|E

25|$|The Gesta {{was first}} {{published}} as {{the first volume of}} the series Scriptures rerum Hungaricarum in 1746 by Johann Georg von Schwandtner. Matthias Bél wrote a preface to this first edition. Professors of the Universities of Halle and Göttingen soon raised their doubts about the reliability of the Gesta, emphasizing, for instance, the anachronistic description of the Rus' principalities. The Slovak scholar Juraj Sklenár also dismissed Anonymus's work in the 1780s, pointing out that Anonymus <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> Great Moravia..|$|E
25|$|Though Symmes himself {{never wrote}} a book about his ideas, several authors {{published}} works discussing his ideas. McBride wrote Symmes' Theory of Concentric Spheres in 1826. It appears that Reynolds has an article that appeared as a separate booklet in 1827: Remarks of Symmes' Theory Which Appeared in the American Quarterly Review. In 1868, a professor W.F. Lyons published The Hollow Globe which put forth a Symmes-like Hollow Earth hypothesis, but <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> Symmes himself. Symmes's son Americus then published The Symmes' Theory of Concentric Spheres in 1878 to set the record straight.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the larger}} geopolitical {{conjecture}} {{of the time and}} the lack of a formal declaration of a republic, it <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> anything about the role the Sultan might play under this new constitution. From a technical point of view, {{it could be argued that}} it left open the possibility that the Sultanate might not be abolished and that it could have been amended to make way for a constitutional monarchy, similar to one founded by the French Constitution of 1791. On hindsight, however, it is clear that this omission was on purpose awaiting the outcome of the Independence War and the cessation of hostilities before the proclamation of the Republic.|$|E

25|$|Kept at {{the city}} morgue, the body was {{assigned}} to Urmuz's brother-in-law and fellow clerk C. Stoicescu, who stated that the writer had been suffering from neurosis. Urmuz was buried on November 26, in his family plot at Bellu cemetery. On the day, the event was publicized by a small obituary in Dimineața daily, signed with the initial C (presumably, for Ciprian). Both this and other press notices <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> that the grefier and the published author were one and the same, {{and the general public}} was for long unaware of any such connection. Story goes that an anonymous woman visited the family shortly after the burial, inquiring as to whether the deceased had left any letters.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007, it was {{reported}} by the Birmingham Mail that the Comprehensive Spending Review by Alastair Darling would confirm the remaining funding for Gateway Plus. This came as concerns were raised {{that the government would}} refuse to provide the remaining tranches of funding. However, Alastair Darling <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> the project in his Pre-Budget Speech to the House of Commons, instead mentioning the Crossrail project for the South East of England, provoking fury among business leaders who accused Prime Minister Gordon Brown of dithering. Rod Ackrill, President of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce and group chairman of developer Chase Midland, demanded the government to provide the necessary funding for the project and said he expected a decision by Christmas Day, 2007.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2016 Fairfax Media {{reported}} an article to say Polly and Grant had been axed from their morning show in favour of an Auckland-based show presented by Sam Wallace and Toni Street.

In February 2017 Polly and Grant were taken off the air after a dispute with their employer and in March 2017 their departure from The Hits was confirmed {{at the conclusion of}} their contract that same month.
