500|$|Most visibly {{during the}} 2012 term, in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Sotomayor {{was part of}} a {{landmark}} 5–4 majority that upheld most of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (while being part of a dissent against the reliance upon the Constitution's Taxing and Spending Clause rather than Commerce Clause in arriving at the support). Legal writer <b>Jeffrey</b> <b>Toobin</b> wrote, [...] "Sotomayor's concerns tended toward the earthbound and practical. Sometimes, during oral arguments, she would go on tangents involving detailed questions about the facts of cases that would leave her colleagues stupefied, sinking into their chairs. This time, though, she had a simple line of inquiry. States require individuals to buy automobile insurance (implicitly suggesting the unavoidable comparison to health insurance and the fairness of the applying the same principle to health insurance as well)." [...] Sotomayor concluded with the incisive rhetorical flourish in the Court directed at the attorneys: [...] "Do you think that if some states decided not to impose an insurance requirement that the federal government would be without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insurance?" [...] For Toobin, this distinction drawn by Sotomayor was the heart of the argument for the case in which she was part of the prevailing majority opinion.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to legal}} writer <b>Jeffrey</b> <b>Toobin,</b> {{starting}} in 2003, Kennedy became a leading {{proponent of the}} use of foreign and international law as an aid to interpreting the United States Constitution. Toobin sees this consideration of foreign law as the biggest factor behind Kennedy's occasional breaking with his most conservative colleagues. The use of foreign law in Supreme Court opinions dates back to at least 1829, though according to Toobin, its use in interpreting the Constitution on [...] "basic questions of individual liberties" [...] began only in the late 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to legal}} {{reporter}} Jan Crawford, Kennedy attracts {{the ire of}} conservatives when he does not vote with his more conservative colleagues. In 2005, Tom DeLay criticized Kennedy for his reliance on international law and for conducting his own Internet research, calling him a judicial activist. According to legal analyst <b>Jeffrey</b> <b>Toobin,</b> some conservatives view Kennedy's pro-gay-rights and pro-choice rulings as betrayals. According to Greenburg, the [...] "bitter" [...] quality of some movement conservatives' views on Kennedy stems from his eventual rethinking of positions on abortion, religion, and the death penalty (which Kennedy believes should not be applied to juveniles or the mentally challenged).|$|E
2500|$|Thomas biographer Scott Douglas Gerber has {{opined that}} attacks against Thomas from critics such as <b>Jeffrey</b> <b>Toobin</b> have been unusually vitriolic. Gerber {{provides}} many reasons {{but the first}} and foremost was his skin color. [...] Gerber has outlined other reasons. The second reason Gerber attributes in part to liberals' disappointment that Thomas has departed so much from the jurisprudence of the African American whom he succeeded, Thurgood Marshall. Additional possible causes for the harsh criticism of Thomas may be the inherently explosive nature of sexual misconduct accusations, the suspicion among some people that Thomas was less than forthcoming during his confirmation hearings, and the belief in some circles that Thomas has benefited from affirmative action programs like ones he has criticized as a judge.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas is not {{the first}} quiet justice. In the 1970s and 1980s, William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, and Harry Blackmun {{generally}} were quiet; however, the silence of Thomas stood out in the 1990s as the other eight justices engaged in active questioning. The New York Times Supreme Court correspondent Adam Liptak has called it a [...] "pity" [...] that Thomas does not ask questions, saying that he has a [...] "distinctive legal philosophy and a background entirely different from that of any other justice" [...] and that those he asked in the 2001 and 2002 terms were [...] "mostly good questions, brisk and pointed." [...] Conversely, <b>Jeffrey</b> <b>Toobin,</b> writing in The New Yorker, calls the silence of Thomas [...] "disgraceful" [...] behaviour that has [...] "gone from curious to bizarre to downright embarrassing, for himself and for the institution he represents".|$|E
2500|$|Kennedy {{has been}} active off the bench as well, calling for reform of overcrowded American prisons in a speech before the American Bar Association. He spends his summers in Salzburg, Austria, where he teaches {{international}} and American law at the University of Salzburg for the McGeorge School of Law international program and often attends the large yearly international judges conference held there. Defending his use of international law, in 2005 Kennedy told The New Yorker staff writer <b>Jeffrey</b> <b>Toobin,</b> [...] "Why should world opinion care that the American Administration wants to bring freedom to oppressed peoples? Is that not because there's some underlying common mutual interest, some underlying common shared idea, some underlying common shared aspiration, underlying unified concept of what human dignity means? I think that's what we're trying to tell {{the rest of the}} world, anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{motion for}} Mosby to recuse {{herself from the}} case was filed {{on behalf of the}} charged officers, on the alleged basis of {{personal}} gain by Mosby and her husband, personal relationships with potential witnesses, and the financial interest of Gray's attorney, whom the motion claims is a close friend of Mosby. CNN's legal analyst <b>Jeffrey</b> <b>Toobin</b> pointed out that he does not see any serious conflict of interest to disqualify Mosby from the case, and that the officers may not have a case with that motion. The lawyers representing the officers filed a motion insisting that the city must pay thousands of dollars in damages for arresting and detaining them—or else they could sue Mosby and the Mayor of Baltimore, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. In a 11-page rebuttal, Chief Deputy State's Attorney Michael Schatzow wrote that Gray was detained [...] "well before the arresting officers knew he possessed a knife" [...] and that the motion was absurdly [...] "bounc from one ridiculous allegation to another, like a pinball on a machine far past 'TILT. Mosby was ordered to respond to the motion filed by the defense attorneys by June 26, 2015.|$|E
2500|$|The Associated Press reported, [...] "Some {{officials}} said they believed the designations were a stretch—a knee-jerk move in a bureaucracy rife with over-classification." [...] <b>Jeffrey</b> <b>Toobin,</b> in an August 2015 New Yorker article, wrote that the Clinton email affair is an illustration of overclassification, a problem written about by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan in his book Secrecy: The American Experience. Toobin writes that [...] "government bureaucracies use classification rules to protect turf, to avoid embarrassment, to embarrass rivals—in short, {{for a variety of}} motives that {{have little to do with}} national security." [...] Toobin wrote that [...] "It's not only the public who cannot know the extent or content of government secrecy. Realistically, government officials can't know either—and this is Hillary Clinton's problem. Toobin noted that [...] "one of Clinton's potentially classified email exchanges is nothing more than a discussion of a newspaper story about drones" [...] and wrote: [...] "That such a discussion could be classified underlines the absurdity of the current system. But that is the system that exists, and if and when the agencies determine that she sent or received classified information through her private server, Clinton will be accused of mishandling national-security secrets." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 8, 2000, the Florida Division of Elections {{reported}} that Bush won with 48.8% {{of the vote}} in Florida, a margin of victory of 1,784 votes. The margin of victory was less than 0.5% of the votes cast, so a statutorily-mandated automatic machine recount occurred. On November 10, with the machine recount finished in all but one county, Bush's margin of victory had decreased to 327. According to legal analyst <b>Jeffrey</b> <b>Toobin,</b> later analysis showed that a total of 18 counties—accounting for a quarter of all votes cast in Florida—did not carry out the legally mandated machine recount, but [...] "o one from the Gore campaign ever challenged" [...] the notion that the machine recount had been completed. Florida's election laws allow a candidate to request a county to conduct a manual recount, and Gore requested manual recounts in four Florida counties: Volusia, Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade, which are counties that traditionally vote Democratic and would be expected to garner more votes for Gore. Gore did not, however, request any recounts in counties that traditionally vote Republican. The four counties granted the request and began manual recounts. However, Florida law also required all counties to certify their election returns to the Florida Secretary of State within seven days of the election, and several of the counties conducting manual recounts did not believe they could meet this deadline. On November 14, the statutory deadline, the Florida Circuit Court ruled that the seven-day deadline was mandatory, but that the counties could amend their returns at a later date. The court also ruled that the Secretary, after [...] "considering all attendant facts and circumstances," [...] had discretion to include any late amended returns in the statewide certification. [...] Before the 5pm deadline on November 14, Volusia County completed its manual recount and certified its results. At 5pm on November 14, Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris announced that she had received the certified returns from all 67 counties, while Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade counties were still conducting manual recounts.|$|E
