The formation probabilities are discussed in the framework of the pairing force acting among the protons and the neutrons forming the α particle.

40|$|Archimedes Technology Group, Inc., is {{developing}} a plasma mass separator called the Archimedes Filter that separates waste oxide mixtures ion by ion into two mass groups: light and heavy. For the first time, it is feasible to separate large amounts of material atom by atom {{in a single pass}} device. Although vacuum ion based electromagnetic separations have been around for many decades, they have traditionally depended on ion beam manipulation. Neutral plasma devices, on the other hand, are much easier, less costly, and permit several orders of magnitude greater throughput. The Filter has many potential applications in areas where separation of species is otherwise difficult or expensive. In particular, radioactive waste sludges at Hanford have been a particularly difficult issue for pretreatment and immobilization. Over 75 % of Hanford HLW oxide mass (excluding water, carbon, and nitrogen) has mass less than 59 g/mol. On the other hand, 99. 9 % of radionuclide activity has mass greater than 89 g/mol. Therefore, Filter mass separation tuned to this cutoff would have a dramatic effect on the amount of IHLW produced [...] in fact IHLW would be reduced by a factor of at least four. The Archimedes Filter is a brand new tool for the separations specialist's toolbox. In this paper, we show results that describe {{the extent to which the}} Filter separates ionized material.

The use of nylon and glass fiber <b>filter</b> <b>separators</b> in single-chamber, air-cathode MFCs was examined for their effect on performance. Larger pore nylon mesh were used that had regular mesh weaves with pores ranging from 10 to 160 μm, while smaller pore-size nylon filters (0. 2 - 0. 45 μm) and glass fiber filters (0. 7 - 2. 0 μm) had a more random structure. The pore size of both types of nylon filters had a direct and predictable effect on power production, with power increasing from 443 ± 27 to 650 ± 7 mW m- 2 for pore sizes of 0. 2 and 0. 45 μm, and from 769 ± 65 to 941 ± 47 mW m- 2 for 10 to 160 μm. In contrast, changes in pore sizes of the glass fiber filters resulted in a relatively narrow change in power (732 ± 48 to 779 ± 43 mW m- 2) for pore sizes of 0. 7 to 2 μm. An ideal separator should increase both power density and Coulombic efficiency (CE). However, CEs measured for the different separators were inversely correlated with power production, demonstrating that materials which reduced the oxygen diffusion into the reactor also hindered proton transport to the cathode, reducing power production through increased internal resistance.

The valves at the letdown station have been consider replaced with the Twister SwirlValve™ to minimize turbulence created in the flow upstream the separators. This could help the separation because the size range distribution of droplets would probably decrease, and therefore get easier to separate.
