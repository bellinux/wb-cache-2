40|$|Paragangliomas of {{the head}} and neck (<b>glomus</b> <b>tumours)</b> can occur in a {{hereditary}} pattern and may be hormonally active as well as being associated with paragangliomas elsewhere. A number of these tumours may be present without symptoms. To detect the presence of subclinical paragangliomas we screened 83 members of a family at risk of developing hereditary paragangliomas using whole body MRI and urinary catecholamine testing. In eight previously diagnosed members, eight known <b>glomus</b> <b>tumours</b> of which one functioning, and two unknown <b>glomus</b> <b>tumours</b> and one unknown pheochromocytoma were present. Six unsuspected members showed ten <b>glomus</b> <b>tumours</b> and one pheochromocytoma. It has been suggested that the manifestation of hereditary <b>glomus</b> <b>tumours</b> is determined by the sex of the transmitting parent. There were no tumours in the descendants of female gene carriers.

There is often a delay in diagnosis of many years and clinical suspicion is key to diagnosis, although magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in some scenarios. Surgical extirpation can be curative; however, local tumour recurrence and metachronous tumours are common. Three of our patients developed signs and symptoms of the complex regional pain syndrome.

40|$|Introduction: <b>glomus</b> <b>tumour</b> {{is a rare}} benign {{neoplasm}} of the normal neuroarterial structure called glomus body. They present with obscure symptoms making diagnosis difficult and delayed. Though classical symptoms and signs such as pain, temperature sensitivity, and point tenderness are described, imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging is increasingly being used for diagnosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to review the current understanding of glomus tumours of the hand in the context of the cases treated in Brunei Darussalam emphasising the importance of detailed clinical examination over imaging modalities. Materials and Methods: We present a series of seven patients diagnosed as <b>glomus</b> <b>tumour</b> and operated in our hospital from Sept 1997 to Sept 2009. Data was collected from the clinical and operative records regarding preoperative history and workup, intraoperative details, postoperative follow up and histopathology. Results: There were three male and four female patients with a median age of 37 years. All patients had severe fingertip pain on touch with positive Love’s test. One patient had hypersensitivity to cold. Presumptive diagnosis of <b>glomus</b> <b>tumour</b> was made in six patients and foreign body granuloma in one patient based on detailed history and clinical examination alone. Histopathology confirmed <b>glomus</b> <b>tumour</b> in all the patients. All are asymptomatic after surgery. One patient had increased mitotic activity on histopathological examination and is on close follow up. Conclusion: High suspicion, detailed history and careful physical examination can significantly decrease the pre-operative morbidity of the patient with <b>glomus</b> <b>tumour.</b> An imaging study may not always be required for diagnosis. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Glomus</b> <b>tumours</b> {{are rare}} {{vascular}} tumours arising subungually in fingernails. Surgical excision provides histopathologic diagnosis and rapid resolution of symptoms. Objective: Present study {{was aimed at}} delineating common presentations and long-term treatment outcome of this rare subungual tumour. Patients and Methods: The clinical features and imaging results for 10 patients with subungual <b>glomus</b> <b>tumours</b> were recorded. All were treated with transungual excision. Per-operative findings and, treatment outcomes were recorded and analysed. Results: Females outnumbered males with average age being 33. 3 ± 7. 55 years. Presenting symptoms were severe pain (100 %); nail-plate discoloration and onycholysis. X-ray was normal in 70 %, though a magnetic resonance imaging done for five, helped visualise the lesion in three patients. The tumour involved nail bed in five cases and matrix in five, with an average size being 6. 1 ± 2. 13 mm (range 3 - 11 mm). An average follow-up of 16. 8 months (range 8 - 24 months) was largely uneventful with longitudinal ridging in two cases and recurrence in two (both attributed to a sister lesion). Conclusion: Subungual <b>glomus</b> <b>tumours</b> have characteristic clinical presentation. Imaging is helpful pre-operatively but has a low success rate. Transungual surgical excision is safe and effective, allowing better visualisation, easy exploration and minimal long-term complications...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Most glomus tumours {{occur in}} the dermis and {{subcutaneous}} tissues. Lung glomus tumours are quite rare. The current authors present the first reported case of a lung-derived glomangiomyoma, the rarest variant of <b>glomus</b> <b>tumour.</b> A 56 -yr-old female was admitted with haemoptysis. Chest computed tomography showed an, 5 -cm-diameter mass in the right lower lobe with mucoid impaction. After a right lower lobectomy, a diagnosis of glomangiomyoma was made. The tumour had grown endobronchially and its maximal diameter was 5. 5 cm. Although cytologically benign, <b>glomus</b> <b>tumour</b> cells had visibly infiltrated neighbouring vessels.

30|$|The {{rationale}} for imaging neuroendocrine with 18 F-DOPA PET {{is the ability}} of these tumours to accumulate and decarboxylate L-DOPA as a precursor of dopamine in the catecholamine pathway [33]. The increased L-DOPA transport within the cells by the large amino acid transporter system (LAT) and the increased activity of L-DOPA decarboxylase (AADC) documented in neuroendocrine tumours (NET) [34], the high signal-to-background ratio and the good spatial resolution of the PET camera system, permit the detection of both primary and metastatic lesions in many neuroendocrine malignancies. Examples for which 18 F-DOPA PET imaging has proved to be successful are carcinoids, gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, <b>glomus</b> <b>tumour,</b> medullary thyroid, neuroblastoma, paraganglioma (<b>glomus</b> <b>tumour)</b> and phaeochromocytoma.

Case presentation A 3  year old girl presented with the complaints of painless progressive neck swelling in the right side for one and half year. Sonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT neck angiography and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) were suggestive of vacular malformation i. e. giant haemangioma or arteriovenous malformation.

40|$|Subungual <b>glomus</b> <b>tumours,</b> though rare, cause {{distressing}} {{symptoms and}} merit surgical treatment with minimal morbidity. Approaches to the nail bed {{over the years}} have varied from earlier nail excisions to trans/sub/periungal techniques. Nail plate preservation has beneficial effects on pain, and cosmesis and surgical modifications to ensure the same are desirable. We employed a simple nail preservation technique on six patients over the last seven years. After an accurate localization of the lesion based on pin test and MRI, a proximally-based nail plate flap was marked and elevated beyond the <b>glomus.</b> The <b>tumour</b> was removed through a linear nail-bed incision, following which the nail plate flap was reposited without suturing. All cases had gratifying relief of symptoms. Within a few weeks of the excision, no nail distortion was noticeable. No recurrences were noted on follow-up for one year. The nail flap transungal approach relies on accurate preoperative tumour localization. It ensures a protective post-operative cover with reduced pain. A minimalistic approach with no skin incisions ensures less morbidity and improved cosmesis with no nail deformity.

40|$|Paragangliomas (<b>glomus</b> <b>tumours)</b> are benign, hypervascular tumours {{which in}} general are treated by {{surgical}} excision. The indication for treatment of these often slow-growing tumours needs additional criteria for predicting tumour progressiveness. For this reason the nuclear DNA content of 99 paragangliomas, 65 of them originating from patients with a positive family history, was analysed by flow cytometry. Unequivocal evidence of DNA aneuploidy was found in 37 % of these clinically and histologically benign tumours, the average duration of follow up amounting to at least 10 years. The DNA index of the aneuploid tumours ranged from 0. 90 to 2. 03. No correlation was found between DNA ploidy and familiality or between DNA content and clinical criteria indicative of tumour progression, which means that DNA ploidy of these tumours cannot serve as a predictor for an expected growth pattern or familiality. DNA aneuploidy in hereditary and sporadic paragangliomas is not clinically related to malignancy, but indicates that these tumours are true neoplasias cytogenetically...|$|R
