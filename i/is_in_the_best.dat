5|$|Archaeologists have {{established}} that the monument was built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe, the Coldrum Stones belong to a localised regional variant of barrows produced {{in the vicinity of}} the River Medway, now known as the Medway Megaliths. Of these, it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> surviving condition. It lies near to both Addington Long Barrow and Chestnuts Long Barrow on the western side of the river. Three further surviving long barrows, Kit's Coty House, the Little Kit's Coty House, and the Coffin Stone, are located on the Medway's eastern side.|$|E
5|$|The Frontier Militia {{represents}} the military {{arm of the}} Frontier systems' territorial defense pact. The Militia is a loosely governed mishmash of homesteaders, bandits, mercenaries, and pirates, all rising up as 'citizen soldiers' when the need arises. Each brigade within the Militia is responsible for fighting in an assigned section of Frontier territory. Although some brigades {{are little more than}} vast pirate organizations, the Militia has enough resources to be a real obstacle to the IMC's ambitions on the Frontier. The Militia often claims that direct action against the IMC <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> interest of the homesteaders whom they allegedly represent, but not everyone on the Frontier sees it that way.|$|E

25|$|The {{region is}} set to reach a final {{decision}} {{on the future of}} I-81 with input from many local groups, or stakeholders. In early May 2011, this official process was started by two entities: NYSDOT and the Syracuse Metropolitan Transportation Council (SMTC), the region’s metropolitan planning organization. NYSDOT is responsible for overseeing the process and, eventually, its construction. SMTC consists of member agencies that have a stake in transportation decisions in Central New York. Both parties have yet to reach a decision, but they hope to eventually reach one that <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> interest for everyone in the greater Syracuse area. In late March 2011, SMTC and NYSDOT announced the formation of the I-81 Community Liaison Committee (CLC). The CLC is made up of representatives from 37organizations and will give ideas and point out concerns about the future of I-81 in Syracuse.|$|E
25|$|Males {{may also}} use more {{indirect}} techniques {{to mate with}} females, such as intimidation. While most female water striders (Gerridae) have their genitalia exposed, females of the water strider species Gerris gracilicornis have evolved a shield over their genitals. As a result, males cannot physically coerce females because mating is difficult unless the female exposes her genitalia. Therefore, males intimidate females into mating by attracting predators; they tap on the water’s surface and create ripples that catch the attention of predatory fish. From there, it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> interest of the female to mate, and as quickly as possible, to avoid being eaten by predators. Typical mating positions of water striders have the females on the bottom, closer to predators, so the risk of predation is much higher for them. Females succumb to copulation to get males to cease signaling to predators.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} the {{symbiosis}} between fungus and plant reaches a point of inseparability; fungal material is transmitted vertically from the maternal parent plant to seeds, forming a near-obligate mutualism. Because seeds are {{an important aspect of}} both fecundity and competitive ability for plants, high germination rates and seedling survival increase lifetime fitness. When fitness of plant and fungus become tightly intertwined, it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> interest of the endophyte to act in a manner beneficial to the plant, pushing it further toward the mutualism end of the continuum. Such effects of seed defense can also occur in dense stands of conspecifics through horizontal transmission of beneficial fungi. Mechanisms of microbial association defense, protecting the seeds rather than the already established plants, can have such drastic impacts on seed survival that they have been recognized to be an important aspect of the larger ‘seed defence theory’.|$|E

500|$|According to deHavilland, {{one of the}} few truly {{satisfying}} roles {{she played}} for Warner Bros. was the title character in Norman Krasna's romantic comedy Princess O'Rourke (1943), with Robert Cummings. Filmed in July and August 1942, the story is about a European princess in Washington, DC, visiting her diplomat uncle, who is trying to find her an American husband. Intent on marrying a man of her own choosing, she boards a plane heading west and ends up falling in love with an American pilot, who is unaware of her true identity. The film was released on October 23, 1943, and did well at the box office. Bosley Crowther called it [...] "a film which <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> tradition of American screen comedy", and found deHavilland's performance [...] "charming".|$|E

Mrs. Khoo also uses her position of power to buy off rebellion in her charges with gifts and bribes, in a pointed criticism of the government's social policies.

Manhattan notices his abilities are limited by tachyons emanating from the Antarctic, and the pair teleport there. They discover Veidt's involvement and confront him. Veidt shows everyone news broadcasts confirming that the emergence of a new threat has indeed prompted peaceful co-operation between the superpowers; this leads almost all present to agree that concealing Veidt's truth from the public <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> interests of world peace. Rorschach meanwhile refuses to compromise and leaves, intent on revealing the truth. As he is making his way back, he is confronted by Manhattan. Rorschach declares that Manhattan will have to kill him to stop him from exposing Veidt, which Manhattan duly does. Manhattan then wanders through the base and finds Veidt, who asks him if he did the right thing in the end. Manhattan responds [...] "Nothing ever ends" [...] before leaving the Earth to create life elsewhere. Dreiberg and Juspeczyk go into hiding under new identities and continue their romance.

30|$|We {{draw the}} {{following}} conclusions from Tables  2 and  3. First, the new IQA method correlates well with human opinion scores over all four publicly available image databases; the overall results of <b>the</b> proposed method <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> two results {{except for the}} SROCC on TID 2008. Second, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first average case the proposed method performs better than its competitors. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second average case, the proposed method performs better than its competitors in LCC. Meanwhile, <b>in</b> this case <b>the</b> SROCC average performance of the proposed method is only 0.0422 worse than the ILNIQE. Third, the SROCC values of <b>the</b> proposed method <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> two results for JPEG and GBLUR on LIVE 2, WN and GBLUR on CSIQ, and JEPG 2000 on TID 2008. The LCC values of <b>the</b> proposed method <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> two values for JPEG and GBLUR on LIVE 2, WN on CSIQ, and JPEG 2000 on TID 2008. Even in other circumstances where the prediction results <b>are</b> not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> two, <b>the</b> results of the proposed method maintain competitiveness. Fourth, the newly proposed method outperforms LQF for almost all distortion types. Hence, the features we choose {{for the construction of}} the visual word dictionary are more quality aware. Fifth, when aimed at multiple distortion types, the newly proposed method is adaptable and has an obvious advantage; the SROCC and LCC metrics for the proposed method are among <b>the</b> <b>best</b> two results. Additionally, the two metrics <b>are</b> approximately 0.9 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> comparison experiments conducted on the LiveMD 1 database.|$|R
