40|$|Naturally {{produced}} <b>defective</b> {{influenza virus}} has antiviral activity and, in sufficient amount, can protect mice from lethal influenza, {{irrespective of the}} virus subtype causing the disease. However, such <b>defective</b> virus preparations contain many undefined <b>defective</b> RNA sequences, and it is thus not possible to establish dose-response relationships. To address this situation, we have transfected DNA encoding a cloned <b>defective</b> RNA into Vero cells along with the 17 A/WSN (HIN 1) plasmids required for infectious helper virus, and produced molecularly cloned <b>defective</b> virus. Here we used POLI- 220 that expresses a 445 nt <b>defective</b> RNA isolated from a mouse-protective <b>defective</b> equine H 3 N 8 virus, and POLI- 317 that expresses a 585 nt <b>defective</b> RNA from an avian H 7 N 7 virus. Both originate from genomic segment 1. Virus preparations were UV-irradiated selectively to destroy virus infectivity but not {{the activity of the}} <b>defective</b> RNAs, and adult mice were inoculated intranasally with <b>defective</b> virus and WSN (HIN 1) challenge virus (10 LD 50). <b>Defective</b> POLI- 220 and POLI- 317 RNAs were detected readily in infected lung tissue by RTPCR, but these Vero cell preparations did not modulate disease. However, after a single passage in embryonated eggs, <b>defective</b> POLI- 220 and POLI- 317 viruses significantly delayed the onset of disease and death in WSN-infected mice, although did not affect final mortality. Direct PCR sequencing confirmed the identity of mouse-passaged <b>defective</b> RNAs and showed that none had undergone any sequence changes.

6000|$|The {{peculiar}} {{circumstances of}} Trafford's birth and upbringing had accentuated his natural disposition toward this new thoroughness of intellectual treatment {{which has always}} distinguished the great artist, and which to-day is also the essential quality of the scientific method. He had lived apart from any urgency to produce and compete in the common business of the world; his natural curiosities, fed and encouraged by his natural gifts, had grown into a steady passion for clarity and knowledge. But with him there was no specialization. He brought out from his laboratory into the everyday affairs of the world the same sceptical restraint of judgment which is the touchstone of scientific truth. This made him a tepid and indeed rather a scornful spectator {{of political and social}} life. Party formulae, international rivalries, social customs, and very much of the ordinary law of our state impressed him as a kind of fungoid growth out of a fundamental intellectual muddle. It all maintained itself hazardously, changing and adapting itself unintelligently to unseen conditions. He saw no ultimate truth in this seething welter of human efforts, no tragedy as yet in its defeats, no value in its victories. It had to go on, he believed, until the spreading certitudes of the scientific method pierced its unsubstantial thickets, burst its delusive films, drained away its folly. Aunt Plessington's talk of order and progress and the influence of her Movement impressed his mind very much as the cackle of some larger kind of hen--which cackles because it must. Only Aunt Plessington being human simply imagined the egg. She laid--on the plane of the ideal. When the great nonsensical issues between liberal and conservative, between socialist and individualist, between [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] and [...] "Teuton," [...] between the [...] "white race" [...] and the [...] "yellow race" [...] arose in Trafford's company, he would if he felt cheerful take {{one side or the other}} as chance or his amusement with his interlocutors determined, and jest and gibe at the opponent's inconsistencies, and if on the other hand he chanced to be irritable he would lose his temper at this [...] "chewing of mesembryanthemum" [...] and sulk into silence. [...] "Chewing mesembryanthemum" [...] was one of Trafford's favourite images,--no doubt the reader knows that abundant fleshy Mediterranean weed and the weakly unpleasant wateriness of its substance. He went back to his laboratory and his proper work after such discussions with a feeling of escape, as if he shut a door upon a dirty and undisciplined market-place crowded with mental <b>defectives.</b> Yet even before he met and married Marjorie, there was a queer little undertow of thought in his mind which insisted that this business could not end with door-slamming, that he didn't altogether leave the social confusion outside his panels when he stood alone before his apparatus, and that sooner or later that babble of voices would force his defences and overcome his disdain.|$|E
60|$|But meanwhile--and {{here comes}} the horror of it--our {{technical}} instruction is honest and efficient. The public schoolboy who is carefully blinded, duped, and corrupted as {{to the nature of}} a society based on profiteering, and is taught to honor parasitic idleness and luxury, learns to shoot and ride and keep fit with all the assistance and guidance that can be procured for him by the most anxiously sincere desire that he may do these things well, and if possible superlatively well. In the army he learns to fly; to drop bombs; to use machine-guns to the utmost of his capacity. The discovery of high explosives is rewarded and dignified: instruction in the manufacture of the weapons, battleships, submarines, and land batteries by which they are applied destructively, is quite genuine: the instructors know their business, and really mean the learners to succeed. The result is that powers of destruction that could hardly without uneasiness be entrusted to infinite wisdom and infinite benevolence are placed in the hands of romantic schoolboy patriots who, however generous by nature, are by education ignoramuses, dupes, snobs, and sportsmen to whom fighting is a religion and killing an accomplishment; whilst political power, useless under such circumstances except to militarist imperialists in chronic terror of invasion and subjugation, pompous tufthunting fools, commercial adventurers to whom the organization by the nation of its own industrial services would mean checkmate, financial parasites on the money market, and stupid people who cling to the status quo merely because they are used to it, is obtained by heredity, by simple purchase, by keeping newspapers and pretending that they are organs of public opinion, by the wiles of seductive women, and by prostituting ambitious talent to the service of the profiteers, who call the tune because, having secured all the spare plunder, they alone can afford to pay the piper. Neither the rulers nor the ruled understand high politics. They do not even know {{that there is such a}} branch of knowledge as political science; but between them they can coerce and enslave with the deadliest efficiency, even to the wiping out of civilization, because their education as slayers has been honestly and thoroughly carried out. Essentially the rulers are all defectives; and there is nothing worse than government by <b>defectives</b> who wield irresistible powers of physical coercion. The commonplace sound people submit, and compel the rest to submit, because they have been taught to do so as an article of religion and a point of honor. Those in whom natural enlightenment has reacted against artificial education submit because they are compelled; but they would resist, and finally resist effectively, if they were not cowards. And they are cowards because they have neither an officially accredited and established religion nor a generally recognized point of honor, and are all at sixes and sevens with their various private speculations, sending their children perforce to the schools where they will be corrupted for want of any other schools. The rulers are equally intimidated by the immense extension and cheapening of the means of slaughter and destruction. The British Government is more afraid of Ireland now that submarines, bombs, and poison gas are cheap and easily made than it was of the German Empire before the war; consequently the old British custom which maintained a balance of power through command of the sea is intensified into a terror that sees security in nothing short of absolute military mastery of the entire globe: that is, in an impossibility that will yet seem possible in detail to soldiers and to parochial and insular patriotic civilians.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} ways we can extend the problem of group testing. One of the most {{important}} is called noisy group testing, and deals with a big assumption of the original problem: that testing is error-free. We say that a group-testing problem is noisy when there is some chance that the result of a group test is erroneous (e.g. comes out positive when the test contained no <b>defectives).</b> The Bernoulli noise model assumes this probability is some constant, , but in general it can depend on the true number of <b>defectives</b> in the test and the number of items tested. For example, we may model the effect of dilution by saying a positive result is more likely when there are more <b>defectives</b> (or more <b>defectives</b> as a fraction of the number tested), present in the test. A noisy algorithm will always have a non-zero probability of making an error (that is, mislabeling an item).|$|E
50|$|Object-based {{recognition}} {{is a classic}} example of software-driven intelligence.

40|$|Identification of <b>defective</b> {{members of}} large populations {{has been widely}} studied in the {{statistics}} community {{under the name of}} group testing. It involves grouping subsets of items into different pools and detecting <b>defective</b> members based on the set of test results obtained for each pool. In a classical noiseless group testing setup, it is assumed that the sampling procedure is fully known to the reconstruction algorithm, {{in the sense that the}} existence of a <b>defective</b> member in a pool results in the test outcome of that pool to be positive. However, this may not be always a valid assumption in some cases of interest. In particular, we consider the case where the <b>defective</b> items in a pool can become independently inactive with a certain probability. Hence, one may obtain a negative test result in a pool despite containing some <b>defective</b> items. As a result, any sampling and reconstruction method should be able to cope with two different types of uncertainty, i. e., the unknown set of <b>defective</b> items and the partially unknown, probabilistic testing procedure. In this work, motivated by the application of detecting infected people in viral epidemics, we design non-adaptive sampling procedures that allow successful identification of the <b>defective</b> items through a set of probabilistic tests. Our design requires only a small number of tests to single out the <b>defective</b> items. In particular, for a population of size N and at most K <b>defective</b> items with activation probability p, our results show that M = O(K 2 log (N/K) /p 3) tests is sufficient if the sampling procedure should work for all possible sets of <b>defective</b> items, while M = O(K log (N) /p 3) tests is enough to be successful for any single set of <b>defective</b> items. Moreover, we show that the <b>defective</b> members can be recovered using a simple reconstruction algorithm with complexity of O(MN) ...|$|R
