5|$|Besides Ælfflæd, Siward {{is known}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>married</b> to a woman named Godgifu, who died before Siward. The {{marriage}} is known from a grant she made of territory around Stamford, Lincolnshire, to Peterborough Abbey. Although no surviving children are attested, and no source states the name of Osbjorn's mother, this marriage has nonetheless raised the possibility that Waltheof and Osbjorn were born to different mothers, and William Kapelle suggested that Siward may have originally intended Osbjorn to inherit his southern territories while Waltheof inherited those territories in the north associated with the family of his mother Ælfflæd.|$|E
5|$|In around 180, Clement reached Alexandria, {{where he}} met Pantaenus, who taught at the Catechetical School of Alexandria.

He may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>married,</b> a conjecture supported by his writings.|$|E

5|$|Few {{other details}} are {{known about the}} singer's childhood. At some point he met another blind musician, Madkin Butler, who had a {{powerful}} singing and preaching style that influenced Johnson's own vocal delivery and repertoire. Adam Booker, a blind minister interviewed by the blues historian Samuel Charters in the 1950s, recalled that while visiting his father in Hearne, Johnson would perform religious songs on street corners with a tin cup tied to the neck of his Stella guitar to collect money. Occasionally, Johnson would play on the same street as Blind Lemon Jefferson, but {{the extent of the}} two songsters' involvement with each other is unknown. In 1926 or early 1927, Johnson established an unregistered marriage with Willie B. Harris, who occasionally sang on the street with him and at benefits for the Marlin Church of God in Christ with Johnson accompanied on piano. From the relationship, Johnson had a daughter, Sam Faye Johnson Kelly, in 1931. The blues guitarist L. C.
