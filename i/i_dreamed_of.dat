At some point, perhaps {{as late as}} 1934, Roa Bastos joined the Paraguayan army as a medical auxiliary. The war would {{have a profound effect}} on the future writer who said: [...] "when I left for that war <b>I</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> purification in the fire of battles." [...] Instead of glory he found [...] "maimed bodies" [...] and [...] "destruction" [...] which left him to question [...] "why two brother countries like Bolivia and Paraguay were massacring each other", and as a consequence Roa Bastos became a pacifist.|$|E
500|$|At Arsenal, Wenger {{has enjoyed}} {{a great deal of}} support and backing from the club board of directors, who have {{demonstrated}} exceptional faith in the manager and his long-term vision. His arrival at the club prompted a change in their football style – once derided as [...] "boring, boring Arsenal" [...] for a lack of creativity, pundit Alan Hansen described the 2004 team as [...] "quite simply the most fluid, devastating team the British Isles has seen". Brian Clough once quipped: [...] "Arsenal caress a football the way <b>I</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> caressing Marilyn Monroe". Wenger himself reflected that his greatest legacy at Arsenal would be the style he implemented. Supporters regularly display banners such as [...] "Arsène knows" [...] and [...] "In Arsène we trust" [...] during home matches, though there have been a growing number of protests against his management.|$|E
500|$|When Kenyan {{officials}} {{decided to}} destroy their stockpile in 1989, {{they had to}} find a way to do so that would create powerful images. Leakey turned to fellow conservationist Kuki Gallmann, who described their discussions and experiments in her memoir <b>I</b> <b>Dreamed</b> <b>of</b> Africa. She asked Hollywood special effects professional Robin Hollister what he would recommend, and introduced him to Leakey. Hollister understood Leakey's intention to create a spectacle, and the importance of producing an immediate dramatic flare-up. He suggested a combination of flammable glue to coat the tusks, and a hidden system of pipes to spray them with fuel. His plans were adopted, and when the Kenyan President held a torch to the waiting pile, [...] "Flames flared up in a scalding blaze. [...] The ivory blackened and started burning, crackling. Deafening applause burst out from the crowd, while television crews from all over the world showed to every corner of the Earth this new sacrifice of Africa." ...|$|E

500|$|In November 1821, {{shortly before}} his seventeenth birthday, Disraeli was {{articled}} as a clerk to a firm of solicitors—Swain, Stevens, Maples, Pearse and Hunt—in the City of London. T F Maples {{was not only the}} young Disraeli's employer and friend of his father's, but also his prospective father-in-law: Isaac and Maples entertained the possibility that the latter's only daughter might be a suitable match for Benjamin. A friendship developed, but there was no romance. The firm had a large and profitable business, and as the biographer R W Davis observes, the clerkship was [...] "the kind of secure, respectable position that many fathers dream of for their children". Although biographers including Robert Blake and Bradford comment that such a post was incompatible with Disraeli's romantic and ambitious nature, he reportedly gave his employers satisfactory service, and later professed to have learned a good deal from his time with the firm. He recalled, [...] "I had some scruples, for even then <b>I</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> Parliament. My father's refrain always was 'Philip Carteret Webb', who was the most eminent solicitor of his boyhood and who was an MP. It {{would be a mistake to}} suppose that the two years and more that I was in the office of our friend were wasted. I have often thought, though I have often regretted the University, that it was much the reverse." ...|$|E

[...] She described Disney movies as [...] "the ones [...] watched over and over again when [...] was a kid," [...] and continued, [...] "I knew every line from The Little Mermaid. I love Aladdin. When asked about her favorite Disney character, Bell said, [...] "Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Because I think it was a shift that Disney had, where a female lead—the [...] "princess," [...] I guess—didn't just want to find her mate. She was singing [...] "I want to be where the people are. I want to see the world. I want to venture outside my comfort zone."" [...] Bell described her initial reaction when she first found that she was cast as [...] "I was in glee". Lee admitted Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened a couple of vocal tracks from The Little Mermaid, including [...] "Part of Your World" [...] that the actress recorded when she was young, stating that without these recordings, it would've been very difficult to the find the right one to play Anna.|$|E

Following his father's example, Gabriel Constantinovich chose a military career, traditional for the male members of the Romanov family.

In 1900, {{he was allowed to}} join the 1st Moscow Cadet corps as preparatory training; in 1903 he finally received permission to join the Nikolaevsky school.

[...] Di, on the other hand, repeatedly argued to her that it is more proper for her to make her son her heir, and that Li Dan's brother Li Zhe the Prince of Luling, himself a former emperor that Wu Zetian removed in 684, be recalled to the capital, a suggestion echoed by fellow chancellors Wang Fangqing and Wang Jishan, and Wu Zetian began to agree.
