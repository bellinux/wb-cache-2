Euler attributes the Theorem to Goldbach. The proof {{is one of those}} examples of misuse of divergent series to obtain correct results so frequent during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. We examine this proof closely and, with the help of some insight provided by a modern (and completely dierent) proof of the Goldbach-Euler Theorem, we present a rational reconstruction in terms which could be considered rigorous by modern Weierstrassian standards. At the same time, with a few ideas borrowed from nonstandard analysis we see how the same reconstruction can be also be considered rigorous by modern Robinsonian standards. This last approach, though, is completely in tune with Goldbach and <b>Euler</b> <b>s</b> proof. We hope to convince the reader then how, a few simple ideas from nonstandard analysis, vindicate Euler's work...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the overall mathematical model and results from pseudo linear recursive estimators of attitude and rate for a spinning spacecraft. The measurements considered are vector measurements obtained by sun-sensors, fixed head star trackers, horizon sensors, and three axis magnetometers. Two filters are proposed for estimating the attitude {{as well as}} the angular rate vector. One filter, called the q-Filter, yields the attitude estimate as a quaternion estimate, and the other filter, called the D-Filter, yields the estimated direction cosine matrix. Because the spacecraft is gyro-less, <b>Euler</b> <b>s</b> equation of angular motion of rigid bodies is used to enable the estimation of the angular velocity. A simpler Markov model is suggested as a replacement for Euler's equation in the case where the vector measurements are obtained at high rates relative to the spacecraft angular rate.

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the influence of acute psychological stress on oesophageal acid perception. In 15 healthy volunteers and 10 GORD patients with a positive symptom-reflux association an oesophageal acid perfusion test was performed, once with and once without the presence of an acute psychological stressor (IQ test). The order of the measurements was randomized. The time from onset of the acid infusion to first acid perception, discomfort and pain was noted. Blood pressure was measured to assess the effect of the stress task. In healthy volunteers, the time to first perception (control task: 617 +/- 174 <b>s</b> vs <b>stress</b> task: 561 +/- 162 s), discomfort (control task: 969 +/- 158 <b>s</b> vs <b>stress</b> task: 940 +/- 151 s) or pain (control task: 1393 +/- 122 <b>s</b> vs <b>stress</b> task: 1366 +/- 121 s) did not differ significantly between both measurements.

Participants were assigned randomly via random number tables to one of three treatment conditions: supportive counselling, stress management or alcohol-focused couples therapy. Setting. The intervention took place at the Behaviour Research and Therapy Centre (BRTC), The University of Queensland. This research and training centre offers outpatient psychology services to the community. Participants. Sixty-one married women whose husbands drank heavily. Participants reported protracted alcohol problems, severe impact of alcohol on social functioning and severe marital distress. Measurement. The women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>stress,</b> alcohol consumption by the male, and relationship functioning were assessed at pre- and post-treatment and at 6 -month follow-up. Interventions.

40|$|The {{thesis of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is that in}} his letters Augustine of Hippo presents the ordained ministry as one characterized by and exercised in humility. The theological basis for this stress on humility is found in Augustine 2 ̆ 7 s Christology. The dissertation also argues that there are social roots and applications underlying Augustine 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>stress</b> on humility {{in the practice of}} the ordained ministry. The ordained minister demonstrates humility ontologically by always remembering that he is a fellow disciple along with the other Christian faithful. Epistemologically, the ordained minister exercises humility by turning to Scripture, the decisions of Church councils, and Church teaching for guidance and direction in the practice of his ministry. Augustine 2 ̆ 7 s Christology, in which Christ is presented as the model, pattern, and doctor of all humility, is then put forth as the context for arguing the theological basis for Augustine 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of the ordained ministry, since the ordained ministry is centered on the ministry of Christ 2 ̆ 7 s Word and sacraments within the Church. The social roots of Augustine 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>stress</b> on humility in the practice of the ordained ministry are found in the economic, social, and legal privileges of the clergy in the fourth and fifth centuries. These privileges could become sources of sinful pride which would distract the cleric from his ministry of Word and sacrament within the Church. The social applications of Augustine 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>stress</b> on humility in the ordained ministry stem from the social influence that clergy, especially bishops, exerted in Late Antiquity. Humility would be needed to prevent the ordained minister from manipulating situations and people to his own advantage. The social contexts in which he exercised his ministry required the ordained minister to be a model of Christ, the model, pattern, and doctor of all humility...|$|R

Here, we report studies of fission yeast Ctf 18, a subunit of the RFCCtf 18 replication factor C complex, and Chl 1, a putative DNA helicase. We show that RFCCtf 18 {{is essential in}} the absence of the Swi 1 –Swi 3 replication fork protection complex required for the <b>S</b> phase <b>stress</b> response. Loss of Ctf 18 leads to an increased sensitivity to <b>S</b> phase <b>stressing</b> agents, a decreased level of Cds 1 kinase activity, and accumulation of DNA damage during S phase. Ctf 18 associates with chromatin during S phase, and it is required for the proper resumption of replication after fork arrest. We also show that chl 1 is synthetically lethal with ctf 18 and that a dosage increase of chl 1 rescues sensitivities of swi 1 to <b>S</b> phase <b>stressing</b> agents, indicating that Chl 1 is involved in the <b>S</b> phase <b>stress</b> response. Finally, we demonstrate that inactivation of Ctf 18, Chl 1, or Swi 1 -Swi 3 leads to defective centromere cohesion, suggesting the role of these proteins in chromosome segregation.
