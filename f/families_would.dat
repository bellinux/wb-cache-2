5|$|Gum-digging was {{the major}} source of income for {{settlers}} in Northland, and farmers often worked the gumfields in the winter months to subsidise the poor income from their unbroken land. By the 1890s, 20,000 people were engaged in gum-digging, of which 7000 worked full-time. Gum-digging was not restricted to settlers or workers in the rural areas; Auckland <b>families</b> <b>would</b> cross the Waitematā Harbour by ferry at weekends to dig in the fields around Birkenhead, causing damage to public roads and private farms, and leading to local council management of the problem.|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{during the}} 1950s, many <b>families</b> <b>would</b> {{intentionally}} hang gandingans outside their houses so other neighbors could easily hear them play. Young men would gather around the gandingan and gossip about people they dislike, usually “chatting” with other gandingan players further away. Locals says {{much of this}} jovial talk even contained sexual innuendoes, where all kinds of dirty words could be heard penetrating the night air.|$|E
5|$|Bonfatti {{announced}} that Santa Fe province would provide financial {{help to the}} victims of the explosion. Since most houses in the vicinity were damaged, affected <b>families</b> <b>would</b> receive a subsidy of $20,000 to rent homes during reconstruction. They would receive $50,000 in credit to buy furniture and appliances, payable in 60 months with five percent interest. Rosario's real estate firms prepared a list of houses for rent without charging victims their regular fee. Some of the affected buildings may have had cheap insurances which would not cover the risk of an explosion. Some cars trapped in an underground parking lot could not be retrieved.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reform}} period, the Communist regime in China {{regulated}} birth control. The government shaped policies {{with the intention}} to develop population science “through selective absorption of Western science and technology.” In 1979, the Planned Birth Policy was implemented. The Chinese government only allowed one child per Han family, with more children allowed to non-Han families. Since this planned birth policy was implemented based on local laws rather than on a national population law, the level of birth restriction differed in urban and rural areas. In families reliant on farming for income, the household is the fundamental unit of production, so many rural <b>families</b> <b>would</b> rather pay the hefty fines for excess birth.|$|E
5|$|On 12 February 2014, Channel 5 {{confirmed}} to Broadcast magazine {{that it was}} in the process of filming a similar documentary, provisionally titled Living on the Social, in which individuals and <b>families</b> <b>would</b> discuss their lives on welfare. The Hull Daily Mail reported in March that Channel 5 were looking at Hull as a potential location for the series, but that the city council had urged residents not to participate. The Yorkshire Post reported a similar approach to residents in Bridlington in April. Love Productions also announced plans for Famous, Rich and Hungry, a two-part documentary for the BBC's Sport Relief that would see celebrities spending time with families experiencing food poverty in order to explore the issue.|$|E
5|$|The Ridwan-Farrukh-Turabay {{alliance}} {{treated the}} territories of Palestine and, at times, Transjordan, as hereditary fiefdoms. During troublesome periods, the three <b>families</b> <b>would</b> unite their forces to confront challenges from rebels or local rivals. The military relationship between them originated with {{the protection of}} the annual hajj caravan. When a particular governor was assigned the role of amir al-hajj, it would require him to depart from his sanjak for extended time periods. In order to protect their districts from Bedouin raids, tax evasion and personal property damage, departing governors normally entrusted their authority with the rulers of the neighboring sanjak. For example, in 1589, Ridwan Pasha requested Assaf ibn Turabay to temporarily replace him as governor of Damascus, beginning a tradition that lasted well into the 17th century.|$|E
50|$|During {{his reign}} as {{the boss of}} New England {{organized}} crime, Raymond L.S. Patriarca (Il Patrone) formed strong relationships with the New York City and Colombo crime families. Il Patrone worked with the Genovese family and decided that dividing line between the New York families and his <b>family</b> <b>would</b> be the Connecticut River. The New England crime <b>family</b> <b>would</b> control organized crime in Worcester (which the Genovese family wound up holding as a fiefdom) and Boston, {{as well as the}} state of Maine, while the Genovese <b>family</b> <b>would</b> control organized crime in Hartford, Springfield, and Albany.|$|R

5|$|In 1971, Livingstone and {{his comrades}} {{developed}} a new strategy for obtaining political power in Lambeth borough. Focusing on campaigning for the marginal seats {{in the south of}} the borough, the safe Labour seats in the north were left to established party members. Public dissatisfaction with the Conservative government of Prime Minister Edward Heath led to Labour's best local government results since the 1940s; Labour leftists gained every marginal seat in Lambeth, and the borough returned to Labour control. In October 1971, Livingstone's father died of a heart attack; his mother soon moved to Lincoln. That year, Labour members voted Livingstone Vice-Chairman of the Housing Committee on the Lambeth London Borough Council, his first job in local government. Reforming the housing system, Livingstone and Committee Chairman Ewan Carr cancelled the proposed rent increase for council housing, temporarily halting the construction of Europe's largest tower blocks, and founded a Family Squatting Group to ensure that homeless <b>families</b> <b>would</b> be immediately rehoused through squatting in empty houses. He increased the number of compulsory purchase orders for private-rented properties, converting them to council housing. They faced opposition to their reforms, which were cancelled by central government.|$|E

25|$|Likewise, the {{inhabitants}} of conquered cities were frequently massacred during the Crusades against the Muslims in the 11th and 12th centuries. Noblemen could hope to be ransomed; their <b>families</b> <b>would</b> have to send to their captors large sums of wealth commensurate with the social status of the captive.|$|E
25|$|Roman <b>families</b> <b>would</b> include {{everyone}} {{within a}} household under the authoritarian {{role of the}} father, the pater familias; this included grown children and the slaves of the household. Children born outside of marriage, from common and legal concubinage, could not inherit the father's property or name; instead, they belong to the social group and family of their mothers'.|$|E
25|$|A {{long-term}} {{experiment in}} a county in Shanxi Province, in which the family planning law was suspended, suggested that <b>families</b> <b>would</b> not have many more children even if the law were abolished. A 2003 review of the policy-making process behind {{the adoption of the}} one-child policy shows that less intrusive options, including those that emphasized delay and spacing of births, were known but not fully considered by China's political leaders.|$|E

50|$|To do this, they {{designed}} one reference computer named System/360 (S/360). This was {{a virtual}} computer, a reference instruction set, and abilities that all {{machines in the}} <b>family</b> <b>would</b> support. To provide different classes of machines, each computer in the <b>family</b> <b>would</b> use more or less hardware emulation, and more or less microprogram emulation, to create a machine able to run the full S/360 instruction set.|$|R

25|$|Other bodies {{such as the}} Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC; before 1956 the NSPCC) {{were also}} {{involved}} in sending needy children to the institutions, for want of alternatives. Some 60% of their cases were referred by the parents. In the 1940s the Society had pointed out that higher social welfare payments to poor <b>families</b> <b>would</b> be cheaper than paying the capitation amounts to industrial schools.|$|E
25|$|When the Colonial Government {{established}} Rottnest Island as {{prison for}} indigenous people, their <b>families</b> <b>would</b> gather on Sundays to send signals {{to those on}} the island using fire. These fires also aided those who attempted {{to escape from the}} Island. In 1830, Ensign Robert Dale, who was working for Surveyor General John Septimus Roe, sketched Fremantle from Cantonment Hill. This is one of the earliest depictions of Fremantle. Cantonment Hill remained relatively unchanged during Fremantle's early development, though in 1877 some limestone was quarried from the hill.|$|E
25|$|Even {{until the}} end of the 19th century, both Ashkenazim and Sephardim in Jerusalem stored large {{quantities}} of foodstuffs for the winter. In Sephardi households, these included rice, flour, lentils, beans, olives and cheese. Ashkenazim stored wine, spirits, olives, sesame oil and wheat. At the end of the summer, large quantities of eggs were packed in slaked lime for the winter. Most Sephardic and Ashkenazi <b>families</b> <b>would</b> also buy large quantities of grapes to make wine. Olives were also pickled and Sephardim pickled eggplants too.|$|E

Kelly took over the case and she spent the next two years traveling to various high schools and colleges to present messages about personal safety. When she thought about reaching more travelers with her story, Twitty said that her efforts evolved into writing a book.|$|E

25|$|In the shtetls of Europe, {{religious}} {{neighborhoods in}} Jerusalem {{and other cities}} in Israel {{before the advent of}} electricity and cooking gas, a pot with the assembled but uncooked ingredients was brought to the local baker before sunset on Fridays.
