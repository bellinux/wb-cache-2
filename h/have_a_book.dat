25|$|Taran Svami is also {{referred}} to as Taran Taran, the one who can help the swimmers to the other side, i.e. towards nirvana. A mystical account of his life, perhaps an autobiography, is given in Chadmastha Vani. The language in his fourteen books is a unique blend of Prakrit, Sanskrit and Apabhramsha. His language was perhaps influenced by his reading of the books of Acharya Kundakunda. Commentaries on six of the main texts composed by Taran Svami were written by Brahmacari Shitala Prasad in the 1930s. Commentaries on other texts have also been written recently. Osho, who was born into a Taranpanthi family, has included Shunya Svabhava and Siddhi Svabhava as among the books that influenced him most. The number of Taranpanthis is very small. Their shrines are called Chaityalaya (or sometimes Nisai/Nasia). At the altar (vimana) they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> instead of an idol. The Taranpanthis were originally from six communities.|$|E

Thinking about his future, he goes to see Peyton and asks her to marry him. She declines, feeling that it is too soon.

500|$|Besix Group (Belgian Six Construct), which {{constructed}} the Burj Khalifa, was previously {{considered for the}} contract, but did not win, partially because SBG invested in Jeddah Economic Company (JEC), contributing SR1.5 billion (US$400 million) towards {{the development of the}} project, and holding a 16.6 percent stake in Jeddah Economic Company.

2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} the tour as an audiovisual storybook, sharing her life experience through {{the evolution of}} her music. Catherine McHugh of Entertainment Design reports [...] "Part of the reason Janet Jackson titled her latest record The Velvet Rope was to criticize barriers that separate different classes in society. So {{from the beginning of}} her show, Jackson strives to prove her accessibility to her audience. The spectacular opening presents Jackson's life—at least professionally—as an open book." [...] The stage was designed by Mark Fisher, saying [...] "She wanted to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> opening and herself come out of it. So I finessed that book into the video screen." [...] Fisher explained, [...] "Each different scene in the show would be akin to turning the pages in this book, and all the albums that she'd done in the past—Control, Rhythm Nation, janet.—would be represented." [...] Regarding its introduction, Fisher said, [...] "The elevator deposits her gracefully, as befits a princess, on the very front of the downstage." [...] "And of course, the entirely cool and wonderful and breaking-new-ground aspect of it is that it's all made possible by a thin LED screen." [...] Roy Bennett stated [...] "We talked about developing the show around the scenarios of her career. I kept that in mind while lighting each different scene, but I tried to do it in an abstract way, without jumping too far away from the overall look of the show." ...|$|E
