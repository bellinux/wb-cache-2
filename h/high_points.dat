5|$|Critical and {{commercial}} response to Nine Inch Nails live performances {{has generally been}} positive.

5000|$|The <b>High</b> <b>Point</b> City Schools were {{established}} in 1897, but {{there was not a}} distinct high school until [...] "High <b>Point</b> <b>High</b> School" [...] was founded in 1926. The current building was erected in 1926 on what was formerly the <b>High</b> <b>Point</b> city fair grounds and is the oldest high school in Guilford County. It is an example of Gothic architecture, with three floors and four towers. Charles F. Thomlinson was the Chair of the school board when <b>High</b> <b>Point</b> <b>High</b> School was built. He {{was the first person to}} have a vision for what <b>High</b> <b>Point</b> <b>High</b> School should be like. In 1926, T. Wingate Andrews (Superintendent of <b>High</b> <b>Point</b> City Schools) presided over the dedication of the building. In 1969, with the closing of <b>High</b> <b>Point's</b> William Penn <b>High</b> School a second high school in <b>High</b> <b>Point</b> (T.

5|$|In mid-12th century, the Kalachuris {{successfully}} warred {{against their}} overlords, the Western Chalukyas, and annexed their capital Kalyani. During this turbulent period lasting three decades (11531183), Veerashaivism gained popularity. According to H.S. Shiva Prakash, the Kalachuri period {{is one of}} the <b>high</b> <b>points</b> of medieval Kannada literature. Basavanna (or Basava), a social reformer and the prime minister of Kalachuri King Bijjala II, is generally regarded as the inspiration behind this movement. Allama Prabhu, Chennabasava, Siddharama, Akka Mahadevi, and Kondugoli Keshiraja are other well-known poets among several hundred in this cadre.|$|E
5|$|Once Beach {{accepted}} the commission on March 12, 1928, Juliette Fraser's sketches were forwarded to him. On April 7, he sent completed models to the Mint and photographs to the Fine Arts Commission. Both the Mint and Houston responded with criticism, the former that {{the relief of}} the coin was high and difficult to reduce to coin-sized hubs. On April 19, Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock wrote in a memorandum that the coin {{would be very hard}} to produce because the area of greatest relief on each side was in the same part of the design. Beach agreed to lower any <b>high</b> <b>points</b> that might cause the Mint difficulty.|$|E

5|$|Her most {{important}} 2009 release was the commercially successful Tamil film Kanthaswamy, alongside Vikram. She earned a nomination at the Vijay Awards. Vikram {{said in an}} interview that her role was on par with his, and she easily stole the show on most occasions. Of her character in the film, Saran said that it was the best she has done so far. Also that year she appeared as the female lead in Thoranai. A reviewer said that her glamour and the songs were the only <b>high</b> <b>points</b> of the film. For Thoranai and Kanthaswamy together, she received her third award win, the Amrita Mathrubhumi Award for Best Actress. She then appeared in another English film, Cooking with Stella, which is a comedy that takes a look at the serious nature of relationships between servants and employers. It was selected for the Toronto International Film Festival, which Saran attended.|$|E
5|$|In 1565, Karnataka and {{the rest}} of South India {{experienced}} a major geopolitical shift when the Vijayanagara empire fell to a confederation of Islamic sultanates in the Battle of Talikota. The Bijapur Sultanate, which had risen after the demise of the Bahmani Sultanate of Bidar, soon took control of the Deccan; it was defeated by the Moghuls in the late 17th century. The Bahmani and Bijapur rulers encouraged Urdu and Persian literature and Indo-Saracenic architecture, the Gol Gumbaz being one of the <b>high</b> <b>points</b> of this style. During the sixteenth century, Konkani Hindus migrated to Karnataka, mostly from Salcette, Goa, while during the seventeenth and eighteenth century, Goan Catholics migrated to North Canara and South Canara, especially from Bardes, Goa, as a result of food shortages, epidemics and heavy taxation imposed by the Portuguese.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on 27 October the Middlesex {{continued}} the brigade's advance, and {{was involved in}} a sharp fight in the hills west of the river near the village of Yongsong-ni, killing 35 North Koreans and capturing 80 prisoners, while American aircraft destroyed 10 North Korean T-34 tanks and two SU-76 self-propelled guns. The following day the Argylls took over as the lead battalion. Intelligence indicated that the British and Australians were facing the North Korean 17th Tank Brigade, equipped with 20 tanks, and although the North Koreans had suffered heavy casualties during the previous fighting on the Taeryong River, Coad was now forced to adopt more cautious tactics as a result, advancing in shorter bounds and clearing <b>high</b> <b>points</b> en route. With the war considered all but over the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade continued to pursue the North Koreans towards Chongju over the next three days; however, the advance increasingly encountered strong resistance from North Korean infantry dug-in with tanks and self-propelled guns in support as they approached the Yalu River on the Manchurian border.|$|E

In 1905, the <b>High</b> <b>Point</b> company was incorporated as North State Telephone Company. In 1919, Hayden bought the Southern Bell system in <b>High</b> <b>Point,</b> which had operated since 1907.

5|$|Outside {{the walls}} {{a series of}} semicircular defense lines were {{constructed}} {{in the path of}} the Japanese advance, most notably an outer one about sixteen kilometers (10 miles) from the city and an inner one directly outside the city known as the Fukuo Line, or multiple positions line. The Fukuo Line, a sprawling network of trenches, moats, barbed wire, mine fields, gun emplacements, and pillboxes, was to be the final defense line outside Nanking's city walls. There were also two key <b>high</b> <b>points</b> of land on the Fukuo Line, the peaks of Zijinshan to the northeast and the plateau of Yuhuatai to the south, where fortification was especially dense. In order to deny the Japanese invaders any shelter or supplies in this area, Tang adopted a strategy of scorched earth on December 7, ordering all homes and structures {{in the path of the}} Japanese within one to two kilometers (1.2 miles) of the city to be incinerated, as well as all homes and structures near roadways within sixteen kilometers (10 miles) of the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the three-cent nickel piece {{remained}} stable throughout its run, and there are few varieties. An overdate is known, 1887/6. The die that struck those coins was originally dated 1886, when no circulation strikes were made. So the die would not be wasted, the Mint altered the last digit from a 6 to a 7; evidence of both numbers is visible. Some 1865 pieces in proof condition display a wreath on the reverse that comes much closer to touching the rim than on later issues. These were most likely pattern coins but they are accepted as issued because the Mint placed them in some 1865 proof sets. Many of the three-cent nickel pieces were not fully struck, and are missing details of the design; {{this is because the}} head of Liberty is directly opposite the III, and the Mint had trouble getting the hard metal alloy to adequately flow to the <b>high</b> <b>points</b> of both sides.|$|E
5|$|The {{eastern part}} of Terengganu {{district}} that faces the South China Sea is characterised by sandy coastal beaches that cover the entire stretch of both parts. Small bays and coastal plains can be found. The district is divided into four major drainage basins: Terengganu River basin, Nerus River basin, Ibai River basin, and other small rivers basin. Certain parts of the rivers of Kuala Terengganu are lined with swamp forests. Hills between 200–600 metres mostly dominate {{the western part of}} the district, with more than 70% of the district made up of lowlands less than 20 metres high because of its geographical proximity to the coast. The city itself has a few <b>high</b> <b>points</b> with the highest being Bukit Besar, followed by Bukit Kecil. Bukit Puteri is centrally located in the city, just near the Terengganu River estuary. The lowlands provide the district with suitable areas for plantations such as paddy, palm oil trees, and rubber trees.|$|E

5|$|There were {{complaints}} that year from officials {{at all three}} of the mints concerning the quality of the coins produced. In the summer of 1874, coiner A. Loudon Snowden issued a formal complaint to Pollock {{about the quality of the}} strikings, most notably on the <b>high</b> <b>points</b> of the design; Barber began modifying the design later that year, reducing the relief. The modified dies began service in 1875. In the fall of that year, Linderman suggested that the reverse of the trade dollar should be altered in 1876 to commemorate the centennial of American independence; Pollock opposed the idea, noting that such a change would be difficult to carry out because Congressional approval would be necessary and that it might cause the coin to lose favor in the Orient. In May 1876, former assistant engraver Anthony C. Paquet created a reverse die after being hired by Linderman to improve the striking quality of the coins. Linderman approved of the new design, but it was ultimately rejected by Mint officials due to fears of Chinese disapproval.|$|E
5|$|A dyarchy {{was created}} in Madras Presidency in 1920 as per the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms with {{provisions}} made for elections in the presidency. Democratically elected governments would henceforth share power with the Governor's autocratic establishment. Following the first elections held in November 1920, the Justice Party, an organisation established in 1916 to campaign for increased representation of non-Brahmins in the administration, came to power. A. Subbarayalu Reddiar became the first Chief Minister of the Madras Presidency but resigned soon after due to declining health {{and was replaced by}} P. Ramarayaningar, Minister of Local Self-Government and Public Health, popularly known as the Raja of Panagal. The party split in late 1923 when C. R. Reddy resigned from primary membership and formed a splinter group allied with the opposition Swarajists. A motion of no-confidence was proposed against Ramarayaningar's government on 27 November 1923, but was defeated 65–44. Ramarayaningar remained in power until November 1926. The enactment in August 1921 of the first communal Government Order (G.O. No. 613), which introduced caste-based communal reservations in government jobs, remains one of the <b>high</b> <b>points</b> of his rule. In the following elections of 1926 the Justice Party lost. However, as no party was able to obtain a clear majority, the Governor, Lord Goschen, set up a cross-party government under the leadership of P. Subbarayan and nominated its supporting members. In the election of 1930, the Justice Party was victorious, and P. Munuswamy Naidu became Chief Minister. The exclusion of Zamindars from the Ministry split the Justice Party once again. Fearing a no-confidence motion against him, Munuswamy Naidu resigned in November 1932 and the Raja of Bobbili was appointed Chief Minister in his place. The Justice Party eventually lost the 1937 elections to the Indian National Congress, and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari became Chief Minister of Madras Presidency.|$|E
5|$|Before the North Vietnamese {{finalised}} {{their plan}} to capture Da Nang, the 2nd Army Corps {{had already begun}} making preparations for the final attack on the city. On March 24, the VPA 325th Division fought with the ARVN 258th Marines Brigade and the 914th Regional Force Battalion at North Hai Van, and overran Phuoc Tuong, Nuoc Ngot, Tho Son and Thua Luu. Consequently, North Vietnamese forces captured enemy artillery positions in Phuoc Tuong, and made good use of it during the following weeks. On March 27, with air-support from A-37 attack aircraft from Da Nang, the 258th Marines Brigade and the 914th Regional Force Battalion tried to hold off North Vietnamese forces at Phu Gia and Hai Van, but they were pushed back and sustained heavy casualties in the process. The VPA 325th Division then continued their advance through So Hai, Loan Ly, An Bao and Lang Co. Soon afterwards, more than 30 artillery pieces belonging to the VPA 84th and 164th Artillery Regiments were placed at various <b>high</b> <b>points</b> in Son Thach, Son Khanh and Mui Trau; beginning at 5:30am on March 28, North Vietnamese artillery units bombarded South Vietnamese positions around Da Nang. Meanwhile, the ARVN 369th Marines Brigade quickly abandoned their position at Son Ga, after they had detected elements of the VPA 304th Division conducting reconnaissance missions on the battlefield. On March 28, the VPA 66th Regiment (304th Division) attacked and captured the administrative area of Ai Nghia and Nuoc Man airfield, while the VPA 24th Regiment attacked Hoa Cam and Toa in the outskirts of Da Nang.|$|E

5|$|There were {{no further}} engagements that day, so Beresford {{was able to}} {{complete}} his dispositions. The front of the Allied position was defined {{by a series of}} small watercourses flowing from south to north. Two of these, the Nogales (sometimes called the Feria) and Chicapierna brooks, meet just south of the village to form the Albuera river, but none of these were formidable obstacles and the river itself could be crossed at two bridges and a ford. Alten's men were placed in Albuera itself, while Hamilton's division along with most of the Portuguese cavalry formed the Allied left wing {{to the north of the}} village and Major General William Stewart's 2nd Division formed up on a hill just to the west of Albuera. The right wing of the Allied army was to be supplied by Castaños's and Blake's four Spanish infantry divisions, while the Allied cavalry and artillery along with the 4th Division would provide a strong strategic reserve. To the west of the Chicapierna and the Albuera, the land rises to a low, treeless north-south ridge crowned by several knolls that become progressively higher to the south. After the battle, Beresford was severely criticized for failing to occupy two of these <b>high</b> <b>points,</b> the first of which lies approximately one mile southwest of the village and the second some 500 yards further south.|$|E
