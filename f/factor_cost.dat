It {{has been observed}} {{that there has been}} a slow but steady decline in the percentage share of industry and agriculture over the years. Agriculture is the leading economic sector in West Bengal. Rice is the state's principal food crop. Rice, potato, jute, sugarcane, and wheat are the top five crops of the state. Tea is produced commercially in northern districts; the region is well known for Darjeeling and other high quality teas. State industries are localised in the Kolkata region, the mineral-rich western highlands, and the Haldia port region. The Durgapur–Asansol colliery belt is home to a number of major steel plants. Important manufacturing industries are engineering products, electronics, electrical equipment, cables, steel, leather, textiles, jewellery, frigates, automobiles, railway coaches, and wagons. The Durgapur centre has established a number of industries in the areas of tea, sugar, chemicals, and fertilisers. Natural resources like tea and jute in and nearby parts has made West Bengal a major centre for the jute and tea industries.|$|E

30|$|When {{comparing}} similar strategies across <b>cost</b> <b>factors,</b> we {{see that}} the <b>cost</b> <b>factor</b> of 1 incurs larger costs overall, since the majority class is penalized more than its counterpart, and thus by sheer abundance, drives up the NPV costs.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the impact of environmental regulations on the location choices by French firms of their industrial activities. We examine a sample of 3, 856 import flows of French firms from foreign industrial subsidiaries in 1999. We first observe that the most pollution intensive goods are paradoxically imported relatively more from the most environmentally stringent countries. Then, we develop a simple static model based on the production cost minimization in order to control for heterogeneous <b>factor</b> <b>costs</b> within countries, distinguishing skilled labor, unskilled labor and capital. However, even with taking these effects into account, the pollution intensity of the imported goods remains positively related to the environmental stringency of the country where they are produced. This suggests that environmental compliance costs are not a major determinant of location compared to other effects, which are not limited to <b>factor</b> <b>costs</b> and can include, for example, agglomeration effects. environmental regulation, relocation, industrial multinational companies...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{minimize}} the total cost function, {{we would like to}} minimize the price for external data. As seen from Figure  3, there exists a maximum permissible price-point, below which, acquiring external data is feasible. From a business perspective, it is thus useful to locate these points. It is to be noted that since these maximum permissible price-points are bound by feasibility, they are indirectly linked to the underlying <b>cost</b> <b>factor.</b> A higher <b>cost</b> <b>factor</b> would drive the maximum feasible price point higher, as can be seen from Figure  8. For a <b>cost</b> <b>factor</b> of 1, it is feasible to acquire external data if each instance costs $ 0.25 or less, whereas {{in the case of a}} <b>cost</b> <b>factor</b> of 100, we can afford to acquire external instances at $ 1 each.|$|R

50|$|In microeconomics, the {{marginal}} <b>factor</b> <b>cost</b> (MFC) is the increment to total costs {{paid for a}} factor of production resulting from a one-unit increase {{in the amount of}} the factor employed. It is expressed in currency units per incremental unit of a factor of production (input), such as labor, per unit of time. In the case of the labor input, for example, if the wage rate paid is unaffected by the number of units of labor hired, {{the marginal}} <b>factor</b> <b>cost</b> is identical to the wage rate. However, if hiring another unit of labor drives up the wage rate that must be paid to all existing units of labor employed, then the marginal cost of the labor factor is higher than the wage rate paid to the last unit because it also includes the increment to the rates paid to the other units.|$|E

40|$|Cost {{is among}} the major {{considerations}} throughout the project life cycle. The gap between the cost at completion and that originally estimated known as cost overrun {{can be regarded as}} one of the most important parameters reflecting the success of projects. Despite its proven importance, it is common to see construction projects failing to complete within the originally estimated cost. Cost overrun is a frequent phenomenon and is associated with most of the projects in the construction industry in Sri Lanka. This trend is seen in the other developing countries where these overruns sometimes exceed 100 % of the original cost of the project. The objective of this study are: to identify various <b>factors</b> influencing <b>cost</b> overrun at pre-construction and construction phases of road projects; to rank the factors identified based on their significance and identify the critical <b>factors</b> contributing to <b>cost</b> overruns and to make recommendations to overcome critical identified factors in future road projects <b>Factors</b> influencing <b>cost</b> overruns in road projects were identified during the literature survey and the information gathering sessions and a questionnaire was prepared considering those factors. A survey was carried out to identify significant <b>factors</b> influencing <b>cost</b> overruns in Road Projects. Delays in making payment, delays due to utility relocation, design changes during construction phase, cost escalation and land acquisition related issues have been identified as critical <b>factors</b> influencing <b>cost</b> overruns in road projects.
