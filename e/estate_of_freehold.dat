60|$|This act {{is worthy}} of {{attention}} {{on account of the}} singularity of some of its provisions. Being sent for education to any Popish school or college abroad, upon conviction, incurs (if the party sent has any estate of inheritance) a kind of unalterable and perpetual outlawry. The tender and incapable age of such a person, his natural subjection to the will of others, his necessary, unavoidable ignorance of the laws, stands for nothing in his favor. He is disabled to sue in law or equity; to be guardian, executor, or administrator; he is rendered incapable of any legacy or deed of gift; he forfeits all his goods and chattels forever; and he forfeits for his life all his lands, hereditaments, offices, and <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> <b>freehold,</b> and all trusts, powers, or interests therein. All persons concerned in sending them or maintaining them abroad, by the least assistance of money or otherwise, are involved in the same disabilities, and subjected to the same penalties.|$|E
60|$|The Lands of England, {{you will}} recollect, Gentlemen, are {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} holden by grants from the King, our liege Lord; and the Constitution of the Country is accordingly a mellowed feudality. The oldest and most respectable name for a County Representative is, KNIGHT OF THE SHIRE. In the reign of Queen Anne it was enacted, that every Knight of the Shire (the eldest sons of Peers {{and a few others}} excepted) shall have a clear <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freehold</b> or Copyhold to the value of £600 per annum. The same qualification continues to be required at this day; and, if the depreciation of money and other causes have injuriously affected the Letter of the Statute, the Spirit of it has not only been preserved in practice, but carried still higher. Hence we scarcely scruple to take for granted that a County Representative is a man of substantial landed property; or stands in such known relation to a conspicuous Estate that he has in it a valuable interest; and that, whoever be the possessor, such Estate may be looked upon as a pledge for his conduct.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the year}} 1672, THOMAS LIDDERDALE (1630-1687) then {{proprietor}} of St. Mary's Isle, mortgaged his lands by wadset, as perfected by livery of sasine, and granted possession, or {{right to possession}} characteristic <b>of</b> <b>estates</b> <b>of</b> <b>freehold,</b> to Sir David Dunbar of Baldoon (c1610-1686). The St Mary’s Isle wadset passed with Sir David’s lands, in Kirkcudbright, to his sole heir and granddaughter, Lady Mary Hamilton (Dunbar) of Baldoon (1677-1760) who married, in 1691, Lord The Hon. Basil Hamilton. [...] Lord The Hon. BASIL HAMILTON (c1671-1701), the sixth son of Sir William Douglas-Hamilton, 1st Earl of Selkirk (1646) and Anne Douglas (Hamilton), married Lady Mary Hamilton (Dunbar) of Baldoon, by whom they had two sons, William who died young and Mr. Basil, inheriting the Estate.|$|R

5000|$|In 1560 at Colyford, Devon, he {{purchased}} from Sir William Petre, principal Secretary of State to Queen Mary, the [...] "house, materials and furniture" [...] of Old Shute House, Colyton, for £300. This property thenceforth became the main {{seat of the}} family until {{it was given to}} the National Trust shortly after 1955. In 1562 he acquired from Petre a lease for 1,200 years <b>of</b> the Shute <b>estate,</b> the <b>freehold</b> <b>of</b> which was not purchased until 1788 by his descendant the 6th Pole baronet. By coincidence the Pole family of Ford in Devon were distantly descended from Alexander Bonville, a younger brother of Sir William II Bonville (d.1407), Sheriff of Somerset, Dorset and Devon, who built the mediaeval hall house at Shute in 1380. Alexander had married the heiress Hawise de la Forde, and thereafter had adopted for himself and his descendants the surname de la Forde. It was his great-great-granddaughter Johan Pole de la Forde who married Arthur Pole of the Cheshire Poles. He also acquired the manor of Charmouth, seven miles from Shute from Petre in 1575, and presented a silver chalice to Charmouth Church in that same year.|$|R

50|$|George Aubrey William Thorold (1847-1932) was {{the tenant}} of Hudscott in 1901 {{until his death}} in 1932. His wife Elizabeth Barry (d.1930) (daughter of Major William Norton Barry of Castlecor, Kilbrin, County Cork, Ireland) was the widow of John Baring Short (d.1880), the tenant of Hudscott before Arthur Fortescue. He was the son of Rev. William Thorold, Rector and Patron of Warkleigh, which parish is {{adjacent}} to the south of Hudscott, himself the grandson of Sir John Thorold, 9th Baronet (1734-1815), MP for Lincolnshire of Syston Park, near South Kesteven, Lincolnshire. In 1843 Rev. William Thorold built as a rectory and family house Warkleigh House, to the design of Abbott of Barnstaple. George Thorold was the owner of the Warkleigh House <b>estate</b> and <b>of</b> several <b>freehold</b> properties within the parishes of Warkleigh and adjoining Satterleigh. He died 9 February 1932, without progeny. He married (Frances) Elizabeth Gould, born 1842 in Ireland. By coincidence his butler, to whom he bequeathed £400 in his will, was called George Dodderidge, born in 1869 at Crowcombe, Somerset. George Thorold was a solicitor and a keen sportsman. He was a JP for Devon and was governor of West Buckland School and was president of the Umberleigh Fat Stock Show. He left an estate valued at his death at £101,389 gross. Following his death an auction was held by Messrs Cockram, Dobbs and Stagg to dispose of his furniture from Hudscott, in 1,300 lots.|$|R
