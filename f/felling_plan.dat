This particular suggestion {{is based on the}} last two forest management plans. Divisions based on the age class {{in the last two decades}} were analysed (described?) and compared with each other. The calculations of <b>felling</b> <b>plan</b> were based on two different scenarios. Based on felling balance comparison, both scenarios could be used. The second scenario is preferred based on economic reasons...|$|E
40|$|Urban parks can harbour small {{populations of}} saproxylic insects of high {{conservation}} concern, such as Osmoderma eremita and other rare beetles. These areas often host old trees {{which have become}} very uncommon in rural areas where they are threatened by commercial forestry management procedures based on frequent tree cutting. Nevertheless, old trees of urban parks may represent a hazard for public safety and are sometimes cut by management authorities. The aim of this work {{was to assess the}} loss of reproductive sites for saproxylic beetles of the Scarabaeidae, Lucanidae and Cerambycidae, when felling plans are adopted according to a Visual Tree Assessment Procedure (VTA), in a Mediterranean urban park. On July-August 2004, 1, 247 holm oaks were surveyed within the border of an urban park of Rome (Villa Borghese). The occurrence of saproxylic beetles (i. e. the presence of frass, living insects or their remains) was verified in 66 old holm oaks, 41 % of which were doomed to cutting by VTA. Eleven of these trees (41 % of the trees doomed to be cut) held fragments of adults and sometimes living larvae of Osmoderma eremita, and four of them (36 %) were included in the <b>felling</b> <b>plan.</b> The presence of Osmoderma eremita in tree holes was more frequent in deep cavities. The presence of frass in the cavities was positively associated with tree height and a high degree of damage at the root collar and negatively with the presence of hole-nesting birds...|$|E
40|$|Pre-project geoecological {{studies were}} carried out in autumn 2015 along {{the entire length of the}} Tikhomandritsa river, in Navolok lake waters near the river source and Udomlya lake near its mouth, as well as on the {{territory}} adjacent to the river, as part of the Comprehensive Engineering Surveys. The aim of the studies was to obtain initial data to assess the current ambient conditions of the study area, as well as to develop the project of cleaning the upper stretch of the Tikhomandritsa riverbed and spillway structure construction. Water, bottom sediments and soil contamination levels were identified. It is found that the water quality in the studied water bodies belongs to the contaminated category. Bottom sediments at the upper stretch of the river up to a distance of 2. 5 km from its source are pure and can be used in agriculture without restrictions. Bottom sediments samples taken at a distance of 5. 5 km from the river source and its mouth contain dangerous level of coliform bacteria. Basing on the territory survey a tree and shurberry <b>felling</b> <b>plan</b> was drawn up and the volume of works of the river purification was determined. The project implementation will help to increase the river flow in dry water years, increase its self-cleaning velocity and environmental improvement of the area. In addition, the increase of water flow into Udomlya lake will provide Kalinin NPP with additional water resources for its process water supply. The conceptual scheme of this study is largely applicable for the basins of other small rivers...|$|E

40|$|Istraživanje o strukturi nadzemne biomase obične bukve provedeno je na tri različite lokacije unutar šumsko­gospodarskog područja Republike Hrvatske, a cilj je bio utvrditi pogodnost uporabe alometrijskih funkcija za izračun biomase obične bukve u različitim sastojinskim uvjetima. Alometrijske funkcije konstruirane su na temelju podataka prikupljenih neposredno in situ destruktivnom metodom. Prema uzgojnom obliku sastojine A i C su visokog uzgojnog oblika, dok je sastojina B panjača. Sastojine A i B su brdske bukove šume kojima se gospodari regularno, a sastojina C je preborna jelovo-bukova šuma. Na svakom lokalitetu posječen je i izmjeren određen broj stabala, pri čemu se posebna pozornost posvetila  na reprezentativnost uzorka (prsni promjer) s obzirom na distri­bu­ciju doznačenih stabala. Svakom posječenom stablu izmjereni su prsni promjer i visina (duljina). Obujam krupnoga drva promjera > 7 cm utvrđen je metodom sekcioniranja. Grane promjera od 3 cm do 7 cm s korom izmjerene su, odnosno sekcionirane kao i krupno drvo, a ostalom dijelu sitne granjevine tanjem od 3 cm određena je masa u svježem stanju. Oblikovanje izračuna biomase triju sastavnica, kao i ukupne nadzemne biomase, izvršeno je prema tri različita modela. Za ocjenu modela korištena su dva parametra, koeficijent determinacije (R 2) te drugi korijen prosječne kvadratne pogreške (RMSE). Na osnovi navedenih parametra, za ocjenu modela najbolji model za procjenu svih triju sastavnica te ukupne nadzemne biomase je model 2 – eksponencijalna jednadžba s dvije nezavisne varijable (d, h) i tri koeficijenta. Od preostala dva ispitivana modela, najbolji se pokazao model 1 i to u 9 slučajeva, što je bilo pomalo neočekivano, jer model 3, koji kao nezavisnu varijablu koristi obujam stabala iz lokalnih tarifa propisanih osnovom gospodarenja, već obuhvaća informacije o promjeru i visini stabala. Najveći pri­nos biomase očekivano je u sastojinama viših boniteta. Povećanjem prsnog promjera stabla povećava se postotni udio biomase krupnog drva promjera > 7 cm u ukupnoj nadzemnoj biomasi stabla, a to povećanje najizraziti­je je u regularnoj sastojini II boniteta. Udio biomase granjevine promjera 3 – 7 cm gotovo je konstantan promjenom prs­nog promjera stabla, dok se biomasa treće sastavnice (granjevina 7 cm was {{determined}} by the sectioning method. Branches with a diameter of 3 cm to 7 cm with bark was measured (sectioned)   {{and for the rest of}} the brushwood, thinner than 3 cm, fresh mass {{was determined}}. In felling sites A and B research was conducted in the dormant season, and in the felling site C research was conducted during the growing season. Therefore, the amount of brushwood thinner diameter than 3 cm biomass included foliar biomass. Modeling of three components of biomass, and total aboveground biomass was carried out according to equations 1, 2 and 3, Equation 1 uses dbh as input with two coefficients (a i b), in Equation 2 an additional independent variable (tree height) was included in order to improve the model and it contains three coefficients (a, b and c). When planning harvesting operations, under the <b>felling</b> <b>plan</b> based on dbh of the marked trees (which are directly measured) with the help of prescribed tariffs planned gross volume of a tree in a specified dbh class is calculated. For this reason (availability of data) in equation 3 volume of tree from tariffs is included as the independent variable with two coefficients a and b. For the evaluation of the models two parameterswere used, the coefficient of determination (R 2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Based on these parameters the best model for the calculation of all three abovegaround biomass components and for the total aboveground biomass is model 2, the exponential equation with two independent variables (d, h), and three coefficients (Table 4). In 11 of the 12 cases this model gives the best results. After the model 2, from the other two models tested, the best model has proven to be the model 1 (in 9 cases). This is somewhat unexpected because the remaining  model 3, which uses the volume of tree calculated on the basis of local tariffs prescribed by the management plan as an independent parameter, already includes information on the diameter and height of trees. Therefore, it was expected that this model will be better than model 1, but that was not determined in this study. Mentioned model 3 proved to be better in just 3 cases. Determining the amount of two categories of aboveground biomass wita a diameter less than 7 cm is particularly important because in the traditional wood harvesting this part of the forest residue usually remains unused, and in the production of wood chips is a usable income potential of our forests. When comparing the features of marked and cut trees from three different felling areas, the highest yield of biomass is in the stands of higher site index, as expected. By increasing the dbh of trees the percentage of the biomass of wood > 7 cm in total aboveground tree biomass increases, and this increase was most pronounced in the regular stand of the site index II. The share of brushwood 3 – 7 cm biomass is almost constant when dbh increases, while the share of the third component of biomass (branches < 3 cm) reduces by increasing the dbh, which is more noticeable in regular stands. Models proposed in this paper can represent the basis for further research in order to improve the planning of the production process and the subsequent analysis of felling results. Biomass of a diameter less than 7 cm represents a special potential, which share in certain stand conditions can reach over 10 % of the total aboveground biomass of trees with larger dbh (including foliar biomass), and over 20 % of the total aboveground biomass of trees with the smaller dbh (Figure 5) ...|$|E

It {{has been designed to}} cope with the {{forest management}} and landscape problems arising from the clear felling and re-stocking of large areas of even-aged forest in the Borders where windthrow is pre-valent and protection from deer is necessary. The aim has been to restructure the forest by creating distinct permanent felling coupes with relatively windfirm boundaries conforming to the scale and shape of the landscape. Thereafter the felling sequence for these new compartments has been arranged so far as possible to im-prove the distribution of age classes within the forest by exploiting any differences in species and rates of development in the present crops at different elevations.
