Findings: The propagation of <b>superficial</b> <b>cracks</b> in articular cartilage does not follow the classical crack tip advance that is characteristic of most engineering materials. Instead, the crack tip exhibited a negligible movement while the side edges of the crack rotated about it, accompanied by matrix stretching and an upward pull (necking) of the bottom layer of the sample. As loading progresses, the crack edges stretch and rotate to assume a position parallel to the articular surface, followed by the final fracture of the matrix at a point just below the crack tip. Using the recorded mechanical data and images, an analogous poroelastic fracture toughness, KpIC = 1. 83 MPa. (SD 0. 8) is introduced. Interpretation: It is extremely difficult for a <b>superficial</b> <b>crack</b> to propagate through articular cartilage.

In both the total length of the <b>superficial</b> <b>cracks</b> and the mean depth of the radial cracks versus cycles curve， there is a sudden bent on the way.

Effects were monitored in terms of axial strain, changes in water content, <b>superficial</b> <b>cracks,</b> chondrocyte viability, and proteoglycan release. Injury worsened monotonically with peak stress, but varied substantially with strain rate. High strain rates resulted in significant matrix fluid pressurization and impact-like surface cracking with cell death near the superficial zone. Below the gel diffusion rate, cells died throughout the tissue depth during extensive matrix consolidation without cracks. At approximately the gel diffusion rate, no measurable injury occurred, even for peak stresses of 14 MPa and axial compressive strains near 0. 8. The gel diffusion rate therefore represented a threshold separating different biomechanical regimes of injury, but at which cartilage was relatively "safe" from injury.

For hardened and tempered steel, failure mode was micro-pitting, started from surface, but evolved into pitting because of crack path extending more deeply beneath the surface.

These cracks are generally of small size and can occur superficially, from top to bottom, from bottom to top, or they can run across the entire HMA layer thickness. Pavement rehabilitation is planned according to the bearing capacity of the pavement that is related to the number of cracks but also to its width (opening) and depth. Visible surface cracks can be manifested as <b>superficial</b> <b>cracks</b> or as cracks that already crossed the entire layer, and, both situations need different rehabilitation strategies. Therefore, there is an urgent need of accurate assessment of cracks characteristics to plan rehabilitation accordingly. Due to its characteristics useful for road inspection and high resolution, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) was used to assess its capability on detecting cracks of different widths. A laboratory experiment was setup to analyze the detectability of a crack in an asphalt slab (across the entire thickness) before and after a new slab was placed over the cracked one.

Typically in the models that correlate the instrumented test results to CTOA values, {{the position of the}} fracture development is assumed straight, i. e. independent to specimen thickness. With this assumption in mind, the residual ligament computation is apparently easy. On the contrary, a remarkable fracture tunneling is present: it looks like different pipeline materials present a different attitude to crack tunneling. In order to know the real shape of the fracture, silicone casts of DWTT fractured specimens were made when stable propagation is achieved. The casts are analyzed through tomographycal approach. Through the image processing of DWT tests, it is possible to automatically compute the angle of opening at the <b>superficial</b> <b>crack</b> tip during propagation as well as the overall kinematics during loading.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a review of}} two main groups of {{structural}} damage identification methods by dynamic tests is presented. The first group is concerned with metallic thin structures damages or imperfections and the second one with reinforced concrete beam structures damages. 1. The first group is addressed to the detection of potential imperfections, fissures and cracks appearing in industrial machines, aeronautical structures and motor engines. They are typically metallic structures and the tests are carried under controlled environment conditions, such as in a laboratory. The application of body waves, and more often, guided waves, as Rayleigh and Lamb waves, as dynamic excitation in order to detect the damage, is described. The studied imperfections have been divided into three classes. • Cracks, related to the structural safety. They are penetrating {{a significant part of}} the plate thickness. • The second class of imperfections are small cracks or fissures, and they can be called partially penetrating ones because they are extended only to a small part of the plate thickness. Imperfections of this class are difficult to detect, because sometimes they can not be observed on the plate surfaces. • Finally, the third class of imperfections are the <b>superficial</b> <b>cracks</b> and they are more related to the durability of the structure than to its safety. These imperfections are more connected to structural protection to the environment, i. e. to protective painting and coating. Dynamic models used to detect the first class of imperfections have been Kirchhoff or Reissner bending thin plate. The crack detection can be achieved quite accurately by comparison between the first spatial derivatives of the mode shapes of the uncracked and cracked plates. Partially penetrating and <b>superficial</b> <b>cracks</b> have been identified by application as dynamic input of Lamb and Rayleigh waves respectively. The use of these guide waves seems to be a very promising technique for imperfection detection. However, computational problems appear. They are related to the small time step and the large number of the finite elements needed in order to reach a suitable accuracy level. 2. The second part of the paper treats a different group of dynamic identification and location of damage in civil and building structures. In particular the damage in reinforced concrete beams,typically used in bridge and building structures is studied. Detection procedures in this part differ of the first ones, because the existing structure is tested in the field and reinforced concrete is rather heterogenous material in comparison to metallic material. Normally, potential cracks are detected, during the free vibrations of the structure, by estimation of the changes either of its natural frequencies, or in its mode shapes or in the measure of its dynamic flexibility. However,in general, the differences of these values between uncracked and cracked beams are small and in some cases they can not be distinguished from the inherent measurement errors occurring during the tests. After reviewing several different models applied to crack detection, one based on the linear elasticity has been developed. In this model the cracks are assumed to remain open and the rest of the structure to behave elastically, Using this model a sensitivity analysis of the presence of cracks,depth and location, respect to the variation of the structure natural frequencies and modes shapes can be carried out. Using this approach a crack identification methodology is proposed. Finally,some possible modifications of the proposed methodology aimed to improve the accuracy and reliability of the obtained results are discussed...|$|R
