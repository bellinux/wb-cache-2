40|$|The authors {{investigated}} how tracking performance, submovement organization, pen {{pressure and}} muscle activity in forearm and shoulder muscles {{were affected by}} target size in a 2 D tracking task performed with a pen on a <b>digitizer</b> <b>tablet.</b> Twenty-six subjects took part in an experiment, in which either a small dot or a large dot was tracked, while it moved quasirandomly across a computer screen at a constant velocity of 2 cm/s. The manipulation of precision level was successful, because mean distance to target and the standard deviation of this distance were significantly smaller with the small target than with the large target. With a small target, subjects trailed more behind the center of target and used submovements with larger amplitudes and of shorter duration, resulting in higher tracking accuracy. This change in submovement organization was accompanied by higher pen pressure, {{while at the same}} time muscle activity in the forearm extensors and flexors was increased, indicating higher endpoint stability. In conclusion, increased precision demands were accommodated by both a different organization of submovements and higher endpoint stability in a 2 D tracking task performed with a pen on a <b>digitizer</b> <b>tablet.</b> Â© 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|E

30|$|A second idea {{comes from}} the only other domain {{that we know of}} in which time-series data have converged on fractal values over time. That domain is motor control, where fractal-pattern results are {{relatively}} commonplace in the literature. Using a large <b>digitizer</b> <b>tablet,</b> Wijnants et al. (2009) trained individuals to draw lines with their non-dominant hand back and forth between two targets as rapidly and accurately as possible. They then treated as time-series data the between-target movement times of 1100 trials in each of five blocks. Across blocks, mean reaction time declined and mean slope increased to 1 /f 1. Thus, well-practiced individuals generate fractal patterns whereas the same individuals, when unpracticed, generated approximations closer to white noise.|$|E

40|$|Because {{of similar}} shape letters such as "v" and "u"; "k" and "h"; " 1 ", "l", and "I"; and so on, plus many noisy {{channels}} such as <b>digitizer</b> <b>tablets</b> that intended hand-inputs should go through, any on-line recognition of handwriting letters cannot avoid producing errors.

However, imposing a limitation on the vocabulary handled by a recognition system is not very desirable for practical purposes. This paper presents a novel structure of a dictionarydriven error-correction post-processor for an online handwriting recognition environment which does not impose any coarse restriction on the vocabulary, however, it makes use of a large dictionary to reduce the errors made by the recognizer.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss our {{progress}} on the HID toolkit, a collection of software modules for the Pure Data and Max/MSP programming environments that provide unified, user-friendly and cross-platform access to human interface devices (HIDs) such as joysticks, <b>digitizer</b> <b>tablets,</b> and stomp-pads.

A work-sampling study was carried out to characterize the use of keyboard, <b>digitizer</b> <b>tablet</b> and video display. Subjective impressions of CAD software, CAD hardware and health aspects were collected by means of a questionnaire. Working methods and working postures were recorded on videotape. The two most important differences in comparison with other office terminals are: (i) Â  dynamic working methods result in an absence of constrained postures in CAD operators and allow full-body exercise, (ii) CAD operators spend more time (46 - 68 per cent of working hours) viewing the video display than the average office terminal operator.

40|$|Tool use often {{challenges}} the human motor system, especially when these tools require sensorimotor transformations. We report an experiment using a <b>digitizer</b> <b>tablet,</b> in which different gains are intro-duced between the hand movement (proximal effect) and the intended action effect presented on a display (distal effect). The {{question is how}} oneâs own movements are perceived in this situation. With regard to an action-effect account movements are represented and controlled by anticipating the move-ment effects. As a consequence, participants should be less aware of their own hand movements. The {{reason for this is}} that what counts for a successful tool use is the representation of the distal effect, not the proximal effect. Our results supported this view. Potential application of this research includes the optimization of the HCI with the imperceptible gain method. It benefits from the human flexibility to compensate for and adapt to smaller biases without any costs. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test {{signature}} verification software on both the traditional <b>digitizer</b> <b>tablets</b> and on wireless/mobile devices, in order to assess how the dynamics of signature signing on such devices change. Specifically, this study examined the differences between table-based digitizers (Wacom Intuit and E-pad) and over mobile computing devices (Palm III, Symbol 1500, Symbol 1740). Mobile computing devices may not be suitable for the collection of electronic signatures due to screen resolution and size, positioning of screen within the device, yet software has been manufactured for them. This study examined variance in the individual variables, rather than performance, across devices, gender, and age. Furthermore, data on session signing and repeated visits (between 1 and 45 days) were collected. After analysis, devices were grouped together, showing significant differences in variable traits across device families, but not within. The study found that signing behaviors, when examined at the variable level, was not affected by repeated signing, and that template aging had not occurred within the study 2 Ì 7 s timeframe. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present COACH - a Cumulative Online Algorithm for Classification of Handwriting deficiencies. A {{description}} of our algorithm {{along with a}} performance evaluation of COACH on real data is provided. COACH is an innovative algorithm designed for building an online handwriting evaluation tool {{to be used for}} classifying and remediating handwriting deficiencies. COACH adapts learning and data mining techniques from AI to handwriting deficiency classification in an innovative fashion. Until now handwriting classification has been performed manually by trained therapists causing expensive and subjective evaluation. This application lowers the cost of evaluation, increases objectiveness, and enables repeated testing that can accompany therapy. COACH is evaluated on real data obtained from children with poor handwriting using a <b>digitizer</b> <b>tablet.</b> Results show that COACH manages to successfully differentiate between poor to proficient handwriting.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} tracking line segments corresponding to on-line handwritten obtained through a <b>digitizer</b> <b>tablet.</b> The approach is based on Kalman filtering to model linear portions of on-line handwritten, particularly, handwritten numerals, and to detect abrupt changes in handwritten direction underlying a model change. This approach uses a Kalman filter framework constrained by a normalized line equation, where quadratic terms are linearized through a first-order Taylor expansion. The modeling is then carried out {{under the assumption that}} the state is deterministic and time-invariant, while the detection relies on double thresholding mechanism which tests for a violation of this assumption. The first threshold is based on an approach of layout kinetics. The second one takes into account the jump in angle between the past observed direction of layout and its current direction. The method proposed enables real-time processing. To illustrate the methodology proposed, some results obtained from handwritten numerals are presented...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the impact of target geometry on the trajectories of rapid pointing movements. Participants performed a graphic point-to-point task using a pen on a <b>digitizer</b> <b>tablet</b> with targets and real time trajectories displayed on a computer screen. Circular- and elliptical-shaped targets were used in order to systematically vary the accuracy constraints along two dimensions. Consistent with Fitts 2 Ì 7 Law, movement time increased as target difficulty increased. Analysis of movement kinematics revealed different patterns for targets constrained by height (H) and width (W). When W was the constraining factor, movements of greater precision were characterized by a lower peak velocity and a longer deceleration phase, with trajectories that were aimed relatively {{farther away from the}} center of the target and were more variable across trials. This indicates an emphasis on reactive, sensory-based control. When H was the constraining factor, however, movements of greater precision were characterized by a longer acceleration phase, a lower peak velocity, and a longer deceleration phase. The initial trajectory was aimed closer to the center of the target, and the trajectory path across trials was more constrained. This suggests a greater reliance on both predictive and reactive control...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{approach}} will be introduced to identify pen-based digitizer devices based on handwritten samples used for biometric user authentication. This new method of digitizer identification based on their signal properties {{can also be seen}} as an influencing part in the new research area of so-called sensometrics. The goal of the work presented in this paper is to identify statistical features, derived from signals provided by pen-based <b>digitizer</b> <b>tablets</b> during the writing process, which allow identification, or at least group discrimination of different device types. Based on a database of a total of approximately 40, 000 writing samples taken on 23 different pen digitizers, specific features for class discrimination will be chosen and a novel feature vector based classification system will be implemented and experimentally validated. The goal of our experimental validation is to study the class space that can be obtained, given a specific feature set, i. e. to which degree single tablets and/or groups of pen digitizers can be identified using our developed classification by a decision tree model. The results confirm that a group discrimination of devices can be achieved.

40|$|Patients {{affected}} by Parkinsonâs disease (PD) show deficits in learning novel motor behaviors and executing previously acquired ones. We investigated whether the two phenomena are related, evaluating {{the hypothesis that}} PD patients have difficulties in executing fine movements (such as handwriting) acquired {{before the onset of}} the disease since they perform the task as they are executing it for the first time. We asked healthy subjects to write a sequence of âlâ on a <b>digitizer</b> <b>tablet</b> by drawing the loop of the letter in counterclockwise fashion (as they are used to do) and clockwise fashion (i. e. using a novel motor plan). We compared the kinematic features of the samples produced by healthy subjects to those measured in samples produced by PD patients. We focused the analysis on the ink trace segmentation points, which represent the starting/ending points of the elementary handwriting movements. Our results suggests that deficits observed in PD patients in executing both novel tasks (reduced learning performance compared to controls) and previously acquired task (disrupted kinematic features compared to controls) could be due to the same underlying deficit, i. e. impaired ability of PD patients to retain the motor plan associated to the task...|$|E
40|$|Controlling {{tools in}} {{technical}} environments bears {{a lot of}} challenges for the human information processing system, as locations of tool manipulation and effect appearance are spatially separated, and distal action effects are often not generated in a 1 : 1 manner.

Visual feedback was presented on a display in that way, that cursor amplitude and visual target size varied while the pre-determined hand amplitude remained constant.

Middle-aged adults more intensely relied on visual feedback than younger adults. Age-related differences in speed-accuracy trade-off are not likely to account for this finding.

40|$|In {{this study}} it was {{investigated}} how primary school children perform a graphomotor task which {{required them to}} simultaneously achieve multiple movement goals. Thirty-four 1 st-grade primary school children were asked to produce with an electronic ink pen loop patterns varying in height (3, 6, 9 and 12 mm) on preprinted sheets of paper attached to a <b>digitizer</b> <b>tablet.</b> The task was paced {{by means of an}} acoustic signal of either 1. 2 or 3 Hz. The children were instructed to attain both the imposed amplitude and frequency. By focusing on how local parameter errors changed from one movement to the next, exploitation of biomechanics when the children respected the inverse relationship between movement amplitude and frequency was distinguished from deliberate, cognitive control when the children succeeded in overriding the inverse relationship between movement amplitude and frequency. The results show that children, like adults, exploit biomechanics to a considerable extent. Coupling strength between the acoustic pacing signal and the pen-tip movements increased with age, whereas the temporal errors decreased. The study shows that preparatory writers can pursue multiple movement goals simultaneously at lower speeds but at higher speeds their capacity to do so is reduced...|$|E
