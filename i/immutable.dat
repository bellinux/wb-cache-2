5|$|Galileo, like Tycho before him, {{tried in}} vain to measure the {{parallax}} of this new star, and then argued against the Aristotelian view of an <b>immutable</b> heavens. The remnant of this supernova was identified in 1941 at the Mount Wilson Observatory.|$|E
5|$|While social {{mobility}} was not unknown in Byzantium {{the order of}} society was thought of as more enduring, with the average man regarding the court of Heaven to be the archetype of the imperial court in Constantinople. This society included various classes of people that were neither exclusive nor <b>immutable.</b> The most characteristic were the poor, the peasants, the soldiers, the teachers, entrepreneurs, and clergy.|$|E
5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was <b>immutable.</b> Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|Early European astronomers such as Tycho Brahe {{identified}} {{new stars}} {{in the night sky}} (later termed novae), suggesting that the heavens were not <b>immutable.</b> In 1584 Giordano Bruno suggested that the stars were like the Sun, and may have other planets, possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them, an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient Greek philosophers, Democritus and Epicurus, and by medieval Islamic cosmologists such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers. To explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the Solar System, Isaac Newton suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction, an idea prompted by the theologian Richard Bentley.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{stars have}} been {{important}} to civilizations throughout the world. They {{have been part of}} religious practices and used for celestial navigation and orientation. Many ancient astronomers believed that stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were <b>immutable.</b> By convention, astronomers grouped stars into constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the Sun. The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the horizon) was used to create calendars, which could be used to regulate agricultural practices. The Gregorian calendar, currently used nearly everywhere in the world, is a solar calendar based on the angle of the Earth's rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{about the}} {{transmutation}} of species {{were associated with}} the radical materialism of the Enlightenment and were attacked by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and Geoffroy, agreeing with Aristotle that species were <b>immutable.</b> Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for one part of the anatomy to change in isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by repopulation, rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier's arguments and his scientific reputation helped keep transmutational ideas out of the mainstream for decades.|$|E
5|$|In Soul Reaver 2, it is {{established}} that, in Nosgoth, fatalism is an actuality—history is <b>immutable,</b> and all individuals {{are subject to}} predestination. Raziel, due to his paradoxical destiny, is the only exception to this rule—his presence enables temporal paradoxes to be triggered, altering history for better or worse. Kain relies on Raziel's free will {{in a bid to}} outsmart Moebius and resolve the dilemma he faced in Blood Omen, ultimately hoping to enable both the restored Pillars and the vampire race to co-exist in the future. Soul Reaver 2 opens as Raziel emerges from the time slip and is greeted by Moebius, having arrived in an era 30 years prior to the events of Blood Omen. Two further time periods, 100 years after and 500 years before Blood Omen respectively, are also explored as the story progresses.|$|E
5|$|The {{canon law}} of the Catholic Church is the system of laws and legal {{principles}} made and enforced by the hierarchical authorities to regulate the church's external organisation and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics towards the church's mission. In the Catholic Church, universal positive ecclesiastical laws, based upon either <b>immutable</b> divine and natural law, or changeable circumstantial and merely positive law, derive formal authority and promulgation {{from the office of}} pope who, as Supreme Pontiff, possesses the totality of legislative, executive and judicial power in his person. It has all the ordinary elements of a mature legal system: laws, courts, lawyers, judges, a fully articulated legal code, principles of legal interpretation and coercive penalties that are limited to moral coercion.|$|E
5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} idea of semantic holism, in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and <b>immutable</b> entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E

25|$|Git has two data structures: a mutable index (also called {{stage or}} cache) that caches {{information}} about the working directory and the next revision to be committed; and an <b>immutable,</b> append-only object database.|$|E
25|$|Ksetra–Ksetrajna Vibhaga yoga (Religion by Separation of Matter and Spirit {{contains}} 35 verses): The {{difference between}} transient perishable physical {{body and the}} <b>immutable</b> eternal soul is described. The difference between individual consciousness and universal consciousness is also made clear.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{orientation}} {{is more than}} simply a 'status' that an individual possesses; it is an <b>immutable</b> personal characteristic that forms part of an individual's core identity. Sexual orientation encompasses the range of human sexuality from gay and lesbian to bisexual and heterosexual orientations.|$|E
25|$|For {{function}} that manipulate strings, modern object-oriented languages, like C# and Java have <b>immutable</b> strings and return a copy (in newly allocated dynamic memory), while others, like C manipulate the original string unless the programmer copies data {{to a new}} string. See for example Concatenation below.|$|E
25|$|Other {{parts of}} speech in Navajo are also {{relatively}} <b>immutable,</b> and tend to be short. These {{parts of speech}} include question particles, demonstrative adjectives, relative pronouns, interjections, conjunctions, and adverbs (both unique ones and those based on verbs). The Navajo numeral system is decimal, and some example numbers follow.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of fossils of extinct species was explained by theories such as catastrophism. Catastrophism claimed that {{animals and plants}} were periodically annihilated {{as a result of}} natural catastrophes and then replaced by new species created ex nihilo (out of nothing). The extinct organisms could then be observed in the fossil record, and their replacements were considered to be <b>immutable.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} {{difference between}} atoms and lists was that atoms were <b>immutable</b> and unique. Two atoms {{that appeared in}} different places in source code but were written {{in exactly the same}} way represented the same object, whereas each list was a separate object that could be altered independently of other lists and could be distinguished from other lists by comparison operators.|$|E
25|$|The {{singular}} {{message that}} the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi strives to convey {{is the idea that}} the history of the Sassanid Empire was a complete and <b>immutable</b> whole: it started with Keyumars, the first man, and ended with his fiftieth scion and successor, Yazdegerd III, six thousand years of history of Iran. The task of Ferdowsi was to prevent this history from being lost to future Persian generations.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} believed {{that those who}} were foreordained to the priesthood earned this right by valiancy or nobility in the pre-mortal life. It is by prophecy that a person's foreordination {{is thought to be}} revealed. Latter Day Saints, however, do not believe in predestination, and therefore believe that foreordination is a destiny, but not an <b>immutable</b> destiny. A person can nullify their foreordination through sin.|$|E
25|$|Many Muslims {{consider}} the Islamic law on apostasy and the punishment {{one of the}} <b>immutable</b> laws under Islam. It is a hudud crime, which means it is a crime against God, and the punishment has been fixed by God. The punishment for apostasy includes state enforced annulment {{of his or her}} marriage, seizure of the person's children and property with automatic assignment to guardians and heirs, and death for the apostate.|$|E
25|$|The same inflexibility of {{the grid}} leads to {{disregarding}} environmentally sensitive areas such as small streams and creeks or mature woodlots in preference {{for the application of}} the <b>immutable</b> geometry. It is said of the NY grid plan that it flattened all obstacles in its way. By contrast, recent discontinuous street patterns follow the configuration of natural features without disrupting them. The grid represents a rationalist, reductionist solution to a multifaceted issue.|$|E
25|$|Herbst notes {{a modern}} paradox {{regarding}} the colonial borders in Africa: {{while they are}} arbitrary there is a consensus among African leaders {{that they must be}} maintained. Organization of African Unity in 1963 cemented colonial boundaries permanently by proclaiming that any changes made were illegitimate. This, in effect, avoided readdressing the basic injustice of colonial partition, while also reducing the likelihood of inter-state warfare as territorial boundaries were considered <b>immutable</b> by the international community.|$|E
25|$|Relative to training, a mastery-oriented {{approach}} {{has been shown to}} be an effective way to bolster self-efficacy. In such an approach, the goal of training is to focus on mastering skills or tasks rather than focusing on an immediate performance-related outcome. Individuals who believe that mastery can be achieved through training and practice are more likely to develop greater self-efficacy than those who see mastery as a product of inherent talent than is largely <b>immutable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mahayana Buddhist schools {{de-emphasize}} {{the traditional}} view (still practiced in Theravada) {{of the release}} from individual Suffering (Dukkha) and attainment of Awakening (Nirvana). In Mahayana, the Buddha {{is seen as an}} eternal, <b>immutable,</b> inconceivable, omnipresent being. The fundamental principles of Mahayana doctrine are based on the possibility of universal liberation from suffering for all beings, and the existence of the transcendent Buddha-nature, which is the eternal Buddha essence present, but hidden and unrecognised, in all living beings.|$|E
25|$|The second legal {{criterion}} is {{that the}} constitution must be rigid. This is important to ensure that constitutional provisions can only be changed by an authority that is higher in status than the ordinary legislative body existing under the Constitution. However, rigidity {{does not mean that}} the Constitution is completely <b>immutable.</b> If the Constitution is static, the nation's political development may be stunted. Instead, rigidity of the Constitution merely contemplates that compared to ordinary legislation, the Constitution should be more difficult to amend.|$|E
25|$|Hubel and Wiesel had {{demonstrated}} that ocular dominance columns {{in the lowest}} neocortical visual area, V1, remained largely <b>immutable</b> after the critical period in development. Researchers also studied critical periods with respect to language; the resulting data suggested that sensory pathways were fixed after the critical period. However, studies determined that environmental changes could alter behavior and cognition by modifying connections between existing neurons and via neurogenesis in the hippocampus and {{in other parts of}} the brain, including in the cerebellum.|$|E
25|$|In March 1921 Musa Kazem led a {{delegation}} from {{the executive committee}} to meet the British Colonial Secretary Winston Churchill, who had called a conference in Cairo to decide British policy in the Middle East. Churchill agreed to meet the delegation, but refused to discuss any issues until after the conference. On his journey back to London he met {{with members of the}} executive committee in Jerusalem on 28 March 1921, telling them they had to accept the Balfour Declaration as an <b>immutable</b> part of British policy.|$|E
25|$|Typology {{is based}} on a view of the world {{familiar}} from Plato's metaphysics called essentialism. Essentialism is the idea that the world is divided into real, discontinuous and <b>immutable</b> ‘kinds’. This idea is the basis for most typological constructions, particularly of stone artefacts where essential forms are often thought of as ‘mental templates’, or combinations of traits that are favoured by the maker. Variation in artifact form and attributes is seen {{as a consequence of the}} imperfect realization of the template, and is usually attributed to differences in raw material properties or individuals' technical competences.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} souls {{are seen}} as units of consciousness (Monads) that are intrinsic parts of a universal oversoul, just as different sparks are parts of a fire. These Monads undergo a process of evolution where consciousness unfolds and matter develops. This evolution is not random, but informed by intelligence and with a purpose. Evolution follows distinct paths in accord with certain <b>immutable</b> laws, aspects of which are perceivable on the physical level. One such law is the law of periodicity and cyclicity; another is the law of karma or cause and effect.|$|E
25|$|Dein and Littlewood (2008) {{suggest that}} an individual’s prayer {{life can be}} viewed on a {{spectrum}} ranging from immature to mature. A progression on the scale {{is characterized by a}} change in the perspective of the purpose of prayer. Rather than using prayer as a means of changing the reality of a situation, a more mature individual will use prayer to request assistance in coping with <b>immutable</b> problems and draw closer to God or others. This change in perspective {{has been shown to be}} associated with an individual’s passage through adolescence.|$|E
25|$|In his Divina Commedia, however, Dante {{changes his}} view to another that treats the Adamic {{language}} {{as the product}} of Adam. This had the consequence that it could not any longer be regarded <b>immutable,</b> and hence Hebrew could not be regarded as identical with the language of Paradise. Dante concludes (Paradiso XXVI) that Hebrew is a derivative of the language of Adam. In particular, the chief Hebrew name for God in scholastic tradition, El, must be derived of a different Adamic name for God, which Dante gives as I.|$|E
25|$|The Bohemian Reformation {{was not an}} {{internally}} unified {{movement and}} did not remain <b>immutable.</b> Although it split into many groups, some characteristics were shared by all of them – communion under both kinds, distaste for the wealth {{and power of the}} church, emphasis on the Bible preached in a vernacular language and on an immediate relationship between man and God. The Bohemian Reformation included particularly the efforts to reform the church before Hus, the Hussite movement (including e.g. Taborites and Orebites), the Unity of the Brethren and Utraquists or Calixtines.|$|E
