5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} in the hartebeest is 40. Hybrids are usually reported from areas where ranges of two subspecies overlap. Hybrids between the Lelwel and Tora hartebeest {{have been reported}} in eastern Sudan and western Ethiopia, in a stretch southward <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Nile to about 9° N latitude. A study proved a male hybrid of the red hartebeest and the blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus) to be sterile. Sterility of the hybrid was attributed to difficulties in segregation during meiosis, indicated by azoospermia and a low number of germ cells in its seminiferous tubules.|$|E
5|$|The name {{derives from}} the British Celtic, meaning 'fair, fine, brisk’. It {{is not to be}} {{confused}} with other rivers in the south west of England with the same name. The historic spelling, Froom, is still sometimes used and this is how the name of the river is pronounced (as in broom). In the nineteenth and twentieth century the River Frome became known in East Bristol as the Danny. The derivation of this name is uncertain, some suggest a nickname, taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Danube Waltz, others that it was derived from the Australian slang word dunny.|$|E

5|$|This {{species of}} {{wildebeest}} {{seems to have}} evolved around 2.5 million years ago. The black wildebeest {{is believed to have}} diverged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> wildebeest to become a distinct species around a million years ago, in the mid to late Pleistocene. Fossil evidence suggests that the blue wildebeest were quite common in the Cradle of Humankind in the past. Apart from eastern Africa, fossils are commonly found in Elandsfontein, Cornelia and Florisbad.|$|E
5|$|Aroma {{compounds}} {{are responsible}} for the particular odour or taste in some species, e.g. sotolon in the fenugreek-smelling Lactarius helvus, or the similar quabalactone III in Lactarius rubidus which causes a maple syrup-like odour in dried specimens. Pigments have been isolated from brightly coloured species, e.g. (7-isopropenyl-4-methylazulen-1-yl)methyl stearate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> Lactarius indigo or russulaflavidin and a derivative from the yellow Russula flavida. Some Russula species contain pigmented pteridine derivatives called russupteridines that are not found in the milk-caps. Sesquiterpenes are characteristic secondary metabolites of many Russulaceae, especially milk-caps which have been quite intensively studied. They are thought to be responsible for the hot taste in many species and may have deterrent, antifeeding functions in nature.|$|E
5|$|Later that evening, Jiminy and {{his parents}} {{convince}} a couple {{to give up some}} goods in exchange for a tonic that will supposedly make them immune to a plague.

Even worse, he then discovers that the couple were the parents of the young boy he spoke to earlier. Having realized what he has done, Jiminy makes a wish and receives an answer <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Blue</b> Fairy, who shows up to give him his one true wish: becoming a cricket. Jiminy is also told that {{he has a chance to}} help someone in the future, starting with the young boy, who would grow up to be Gepetto. As for the cursed dolls, they end up as a collection at Mr. Gold's (Carlyle) pawn shop.|$|E

5|$|Born {{to a lower}} middle-class {{family in}} Etterbeek, Brussels, Hergé began his career by {{contributing}} illustrations to Scouting magazines, developing his first comic series, The Adventures of Totor, for Le Boy-Scout Belge in 1926. Working for the conservative Catholic newspaper Le Vingtième Siècle, he created The Adventures of Tintin in 1929 {{on the advice of}} its editor Norbert Wallez. Revolving around the actions of boy reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, the series' early instalments – Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, Tintin in the Congo, and Tintin in America – were designed as conservative propaganda for children. Domestically successful, after serialisation the stories were published in book form, with Hergé continuing the series and also developing both the Quick & Flupke and Jo, Zette and Jocko series for Le Vingtième Siècle. Influenced by his friend Zhang Chongren, from 1934 Hergé placed far greater emphasis on conducting background research for his stories, resulting in increased realism <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Blue</b> Lotus onward. Following the German occupation of Belgium in 1940, Le Vingtième Siècle was closed but Hergé continued his series in Le Soir, a popular newspaper controlled by the Nazi administration.|$|E
5|$|On March 2, 1864, Lincoln {{promoted}} Grant to lieutenant general, {{giving him}} command of all Union Armies, answering {{only to the}} President. Grant assigned Sherman the Division of the Mississippi and traveled to Washington to meet with Lincoln to devise a strategy of total war against the Confederacy. Grant established his headquarters with General George Meade's Army of the Potomac in Culpeper, Virginia. Grant developed an overall master plan of five coordinated Union offensives, attacking the rebel armies {{at the same time}} to keep the Confederates from shifting reinforcements within their interior lines. Sherman was to pursue Joseph E. Johnston's Army of Tennessee, while Meade would lead the Army of the Potomac, with Grant in the field, to attack and destroy Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Major General Benjamin Butler was to advance towards Richmond from the south, up the James River, while a joint army-navy operation was to be launched against Mobile, Alabama. If Lee was forced south as expected, Grant would join forces with Butler's armies and be fed supplies from the James. Major General Franz Sigel was to capture the railroad line at Lynchburg, move east, and attack <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Ridge Mountains. Grant knew that Lee had limited manpower and that a war of attrition fought on a battlefield without entrenchments would lead to Lee's defeat.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{returning}} home, Pinocchio and Jiminy {{find the}} workshop vacant.

Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the sea accompanied by Jiminy. Pinocchio is soon swallowed by Monstro as well, where he is reunited with Geppetto. Pinocchio devises a scheme to make Monstro sneeze, giving {{them a chance to}} escape. The scheme works, but the enraged whale chases them, and smashes their raft. Pinocchio pulls Geppetto to safety in a cave before Monstro crashes into it. They are all washed up on a beach on the other side. Geppetto and Jiminy survive, but Pinocchio lies motionless face down in a tide pool nearby. Back home, the group mourns him. The Blue Fairy, however, decides that Pinocchio has proven himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, that he is reborn as a real human boy (his donkey ears and tail also gone), and everyone celebrates. Jiminy steps outside to thank the Fairy, and is rewarded with a solid gold badge that certifies him as an official conscience.|$|E
