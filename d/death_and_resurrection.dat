5|$|Kenyon {{taught that}} Christ's {{substitutionary}} atonement secured for believers {{a right to}} divine healing. This was attained through positive, faith-filled speech; the spoken word of God allowed believers to appropriate the same spiritual power that God used to create the world and attain the provisions promised in Christ's <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>resurrection.</b> Prayer was understood to be a binding, legal act. Rather than asking, Kenyon taught believers to demand healing since they were already legally entitled to receive it.|$|E
5|$|Most {{religious}} traditions in the Greco-Roman world {{centered on a}} particular city or ethnic group and did not require personal devotion, only public ritual. In contrast, the cult of Isis, like Christianity and some other mystery cults, {{was made up of}} people who joined voluntarily, out of their personal commitment to a deity that many of them regarded as superior to all others. Christianity has its own initiation ritual, baptism, and beginning in the fourth century, Christians began to refer to their sacraments, like baptism, with the word mysterion, the Greek term that was also used for a mystery rite. In this case, the word meant that Christians did not discuss their most important rites with non-Christians who might misunderstand or disrespect them. Their rites thus acquired some of the aura of secrecy that surrounded the mystery cults. Furthermore, if Isiac initiates were thought to benefit in the afterlife from Osiris's <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>resurrection,</b> this belief would parallel the Christian belief that the <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>resurrection</b> of Jesus make salvation available to those who become Christians.|$|E

50|$|Baptism by {{immersion}} {{preserves the}} dramatic {{imagery of the}} meaning of baptism as a symbolic <b>death,</b> burial <b>and</b> <b>resurrection.</b> The symbolism of baptism pictures: the <b>death,</b> burial <b>and</b> <b>resurrection</b> of Christ who died for our sins and the believer's own death to sin, burial of a sinful nature, <b>and</b> <b>resurrection</b> to a new life in Christ.|$|R

5|$|Harry Potter pundit John Granger {{additionally}} {{noted that}} one of the reasons the Harry Potter books were so popular is their use of literary alchemy (similar to Romeo and Juliet, C. S. Lewis's Perelandra and Charles Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities) and vision symbolism. In this model, authors weave allegorical tales along the alchemical magnum opus. Since the medieval period, alchemical allegory has mirrored the passion, <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>resurrection</b> of Christ. While the entire series utilises symbols common in alchemy, the Deathly Hallows completes this cycle, tying themes of death, rebirth, and the Resurrection Stone to the principal motif of alchemical allegory, and topics presented in the first book of the series.|$|E
5|$|In the Reformed confessions, the Lord's Supper is a {{meal that}} {{provides}} spiritual nourishment. Eating {{the body and}} drinking the blood of Christ in the sacrament is believed to spiritually strengthen Christians. Believers are already believed to be united with Christ, but the Supper serves to deepen and strengthen this union. The Supper is also a way to commemorate and proclaim the <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>resurrection</b> of Christ. Partakers are to express gratitude and praise to God in thanks for his death and the benefits it provides. The Supper is believed to assure Christians of their salvation and union with Christ, which has been communicated {{to them in the}} preaching of the gospel. The Supper is also believed to enhance Christians' union with one another. It calls Christians to love and obey Christ, and to live in harmony with other Christians.|$|E
5|$|Mellor's {{works have}} been {{included}} in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award on several occasions, in 2000, 2001, and every year from 2003 to 2010. In 2003, his mezzotint print Cyathea cooperi, portraying tree ferns native to the Queensland rainforest, was highly commended. Subsequent entries have included Of fragile dreams the heart which nevermore in 2005, Untitled (Ernie Grant in Blackman Street) in 2006, Exotic lies and sacred ties (the heart that conceals, the tongue that never reveals) in 2008, and A Transcendent Vision (of life, <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>resurrection)</b> in 2010.

5|$|The Blue Flame is a four-act play {{written by}} George V. Hobart and John Willard, who revised {{an earlier version}} by Leta Vance Nicholson. In 1920, {{producer}} Albert H. Woods staged the play on Broadway and on tour across the United States. Ruth Gordon, the main character, is a religious young woman who dies and is revived by her scientist fiancé as a soulless femme fatale. She seduces several men and involves them in crimes, including drug use and murder. In the final act, her <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>resurrection</b> are revealed to be a dream. The production starred Theda Bara, a popular silent film actress who was known for playing similar roles in movies.|$|E
5|$|The Eucharistic celebration, {{also called}} the Mass or Divine liturgy, {{includes}} prayers and scriptural readings, {{as well as an}} offering of bread and wine, which are brought to the altar and consecrated by the priest to become the body and the blood of Jesus Christ, a change called transubstantiation. The words of consecration reflect the words spoken by Jesus during the Last Supper, where Christ offered his body and blood to his Apostles the night before his crucifixion. The sacrament re-presents (makes present) the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, and perpetuates it. Christ's <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>resurrection</b> gives grace through the sacrament that unites the faithful with Christ and one another, remits venial sin, and aids against committing moral sin (though mortal sin itself is forgiven through the sacrament of penance).|$|E
5|$|Festivals often {{involved}} a ceremonial procession {{in which a}} cult image was carried out of the temple in a barque-shaped shrine. These processions served various purposes. In Roman times, when local deities of all kinds were believed to have power over the Nile inundation, processions in many communities carried temple images to the riverbanks so the gods could invoke a large and fruitful flood. Processions also traveled between temples, as when the image of Hathor from Dendera Temple visited her consort Horus at the Temple of Edfu. Rituals for a god were often based in that deity's mythology. Such rituals {{were meant to be}} repetitions of the events of the mythic past, renewing the beneficial effects of the original events. In the Khoiak festival in honor of Osiris, his <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>resurrection</b> were ritually reenacted at a time when crops were beginning to sprout. The returning greenery symbolized the renewal of the god's own life.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the Doctor, Jack {{is more of a}} conventional action hero, as well as outwardly flirtatious and capable of acts which the Doctor would view as less than noble. In the programme's narrative, Jack begins as a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century, who comes to travel with the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and his companion Rose (Billie Piper). As a consequence of his <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>resurrection</b> in the 2005 Doctor Who finale, Jack becomes immortal and is stranded on 19th century Earth. There he becomes a member of Torchwood, a British organization dedicated to combating alien threats. He spends over a century waiting to reunite with the Doctor, over which time he becomes Torchwood's leader. Eventually, he reunites with the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) for several appearances in Doctor Who. Aspects of the character's backstoryboth prior to meeting the Doctor, and during his many decades living on Earthare gradually revealed over Torchwood (and to a lesser extent, Doctor Who) through the use of flashback scenes and expository dialogue.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} {{elements of}} the ceiling illustrate that God made the World as a perfect creation and put humanity into it, that humanity fell into disgrace and was punished by death and by separation from God. Humanity then sank further into sin and disgrace, and was punished by the Great Flood. Through a lineage of Ancestors – from Abraham to Joseph – God sent the saviour of humanity, Christ Jesus. The coming of the Saviour was prophesied by Prophets of Israel and Sibyls of the Classical world. The various components of the ceiling are linked to this Christian doctrine. Traditionally, the Old Testament was perceived as a prefiguring of the New Testament. Many incidents and characters of the Old Testament were commonly understood as having a direct symbolic link to some particular aspect {{of the life of}} Jesus or to an important element of Christian doctrine or to a sacrament such as Baptism or the Eucharist. Jonah, for example, was readily recognisable by his attribute of the large fish and was commonly seen to symbolise Jesus' <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>resurrection.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to Eliade, one of {{the most}} common shamanistic themes is the shaman's {{supposed}} <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>resurrection.</b> This occurs in particular during his initiation. Often, the procedure is supposed to be performed by spirits who dismember the shaman and strip the flesh from his bones, then put him back together and revive him. In more than one way, this <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>resurrection</b> represents the shaman's elevation above human nature.|$|E
