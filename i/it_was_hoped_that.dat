5|$|In August 1866 Morris {{joined the}} Burne-Jones family on their holiday in Lymington, while in August 1867 both {{families}} holidayed together in Oxford. In August 1867 the Morrises holidayed in Southwold, Suffolk, {{while in the}} summer of 1869 Morris took his wife to Bad Ems in Rhineland-Palatinate, central Germany, where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the local health waters would aid her ailments. While there, he enjoyed walks in the countryside and focused on writing poetry.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} architects Allward and Gouinlock and by the engineering firm Stone and Webster Canada, Ltd. in 1965. Colonel McLaughlin unveiled {{a model of the}} building at his 94th birthday celebration, which was held in his honour at the museum in September of that year. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the building would be open by Canada's centennial in 1967, but construction delays forced the opening to October 26, 1968.|$|E
5|$|The {{paradigm}} gave researchers {{license to}} study isolated problems and find solutions that were both verifiable and useful. It provided {{a common language}} to describe problems and share their solutions with each other, and with other fields that also used concepts of abstract agents, like economics and control theory. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> a complete agent architecture (like Newell's SOAR) would one day allow researchers to build more versatile and intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents.|$|E
5|$|Allied naval commanders {{decided to}} use battleships to conduct a series of attacks against Japanese coastal cities in mid-1945. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the Japanese {{military}} would respond to these bombardments by attacking the Allied forces with the aircraft that were being held in reserve {{to respond to the}} planned invasion of Japan, thereby exposing these aircraft to destruction by Allied fighter aircraft. However, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters had anticipated that the Allies would conduct bombardments and other operations with this goal, and decided to not attack naval forces operating off Japan. Instead, the aircraft would remain in reserve until Allied landing operations in the home islands began.|$|E

5|$|By 1977, traffic {{had reached}} 172,300vehicles a day, which had {{increased}} by nearly 10percent {{over the previous}} year. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the construction of SR52 would help to reduce the congestion. A revised Mission Gorge Road eastbound exit opened in 1979, merging with traffic from I-15. Traffic reached 212,000vehicles a day by February1981, and Caltrans declared I-8 east of I-805 the busiest highway in the region. In 1987, Caltrans determined that I-8 west between College Avenue and Waring Road had the highest ratio of cars to number of lanes worldwide, at 2400cars per hour. Plans to add another lane to I-8 west from College Avenue to I-15 began in March1992.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Charles H. Zimmerman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) {{developed}} {{a system for}} control of a rotorcraft in which, with the rotors mounted {{on the underside of}} the aircraft, the machine could be steered by the pilot through the simple shifting of his weight, and kept stable through the actions of his natural reflexes. Known as kinesthetic control, and similar in principle to the mechanics of riding a bicycle or a surfboard, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the concept would allow for pilots to operate an aircraft with little to no training time. NACA testing proved that the idea had merit, and several companies, including Bensen Aircraft, Hiller Aircraft, and de Lackner Helicopters, began development of rotorcraft using the concept.|$|E
5|$|From a {{historical}} perspective Britain’s situation was likened to that which the Austrian Empire found itself in after it was defeated by the Kingdom of Prussia in the Battle of Königgrätz in 1866. As Austria was thereafter formally excluded from German affairs, so too would Britain be excluded from continental affairs {{in the event of}} a German victory. Yet afterwards, Austria-Hungary became a loyal ally of the German Empire in the pre-World War I power alignments in Europe, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> Britain would come to fulfill this same role.|$|E

5|$|However, British Waterways {{decided that}} their full {{restoration}} {{was an important}} aim in 2002, {{and the construction of}} the main stadium for the 2012 Summer Olympics on an island formed by the rivers provided funding to construct a new lock and sluices which stabilised water levels throughout the Olympic site. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> significant amounts of materials for the construction of the Olympic facilities would be delivered by barge, but this did not happen. Improvements to the channels which form a central feature of the Olympic Park included the largest aquatic planting scheme ever carried out in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the Armour Research Foundation (ARF), {{based at}} the Illinois Institute of Technology, began {{studying}} the effects of nuclear explosions on the environment. These studies continued until 1962. In May 1958, ARF began covertly researching the potential consequences of an atomic explosion on the Moon. The main objective of the program, which ran {{under the auspices of}} the United States Air Force, which had initially proposed it, was to cause a nuclear explosion that would be visible from Earth. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> such a display would boost the morale of the American people.|$|E
5|$|In December 1796, {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars, a French expeditionary force {{departed}} from Brest on {{an expedition to}} invade Ireland. This army of 18,000 French soldiers was intended to link up with the secret organisation of Irish nationalists known as the United Irishmen and provoke a widespread uprising throughout the island. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the resulting war would force Britain {{to make peace with}} the French Republic or risk losing control of Ireland altogether. Led by Vice-Admiral Morard de Galles, General Lazare Hoche and leader of the United Irishmen Wolfe Tone, the invasion fleet included 17 ships of the line, 27 smaller warships and transports, and carried extensive field artillery, cavalry and military stores to equip the Irish irregular forces they hoped to raise.|$|E

5|$|In Rochefort, an {{expedition}} was planned to carry {{supplies to the}} French West Indies while the British were distracted by Willaumez's operations. Assigned to the operation was Commodore Eleonore-Jean-Nicolas Soleil, an officer who had served on Allemand's expedition, a successful operation the year before. To carry the supplies and reinforcements, Soleil was provided with seven ships: Four large modern frigates rated at 40-guns but actually carrying 44–46, a smaller and older frigate of 36 guns and two small corvettes of 16 guns each. All of the ships were heavily laden, each carrying as many as 650 men, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> their size and speed {{would allow them to}} defeat anything smaller than they were and to escape anything larger.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the Air Force would {{guard the}} plane, but, lacking hangar space, {{it was left}} {{outdoors}} on a remote part of the air base, exposed to the elements. Souvenir hunters broke in and removed parts. Insects and birds then gained access to the aircraft. Paul E. Garber of the Smithsonian Institution, became concerned about the Enola Gays condition, and on 10 August 1960, Smithsonian staff began dismantling the aircraft. The components were transported to the Smithsonian storage facility at Suitland, Maryland, on 21 July 1961.|$|E
5|$|Lindow Man's {{last meal}} was {{preserved}} {{in his stomach}} and intestines and was analysed in some detail. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> investigations into {{the contents of the}} stomach would shed light on the contemporary diet, {{as was the case with}} Grauballe Man and Tollund Man in the 1950s. The analysis of the contents of the digestive system of bog bodies had become one of the principal endeavours of investigating such remains. Analysis of the grains present revealed his diet to be mostly of cereals. He probably ate slightly charred bread, although the burning may have had ritual significance rather than being an accident. Some mistletoe pollen was also found in the stomach, indicating that Lindow Man died in March or April.|$|E
