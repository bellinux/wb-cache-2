5|$|Susan {{encourages}} her elderly neighbor Roy (Orson Bean) {{to propose}} {{to his girlfriend}} Karen (Kathryn Joosten), and he does so after Karen indicates {{she wants to get}} married. Later, however, Roy laments to Susan about being put in the situation, and fears he will start lusting after other women now that he is engaged. Later, Karen learns she may have lung cancer. Roy tells Susan he is marrying Karen because he now realizes {{he does not want to}} lose Karen, and <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> she will beat the cancer.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} {{gathered}} {{to watch a}} performance of Meyerbeer's opera Les Huguenots and this is Ox's chosen occasion for his experiment. Things start slowly and then speed up and become chaotic as the experiment proceeds. The audience join in the performance. Uproar occurs. Frantz challenges Fritz to a duel for flirting with Suzel. Hermance is left alone when everyone else has left the theatre.She wonders what has happened. She <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> someone must pay.|$|E
5|$|Watson's basic working {{principle}} is to parse keywords in a clue while searching for related terms as responses. This gives Watson some {{advantages and disadvantages}} compared with human Jeopardy! players. Watson has deficiencies in understanding the contexts of the clues. As a result, human players usually generate responses faster than Watson, especially to short clues. Watson's programming prevents it from using the popular tactic of buzzing before it <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> of its response. Watson has consistently better reaction time on the buzzer once it has generated a response, and is immune to human players' psychological tactics, such as jumping between categories on every clue.|$|E

25|$|Miller dates this at 1805, but Thomson <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> {{this must}} have been about 1781. Several writers have taken this as a serious proposal, {{including}} the engineer James Leslie in a respected journal. Of course filling in the canal would not have retrieved the money expended in digging it.|$|E
25|$|To {{the present}} day Roddy Collins' name <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> to spark intense debate amongst the Bohemians faithful, with some fans {{opposing}} and supporting the former manager. He managed the club for 96 league games – winning 46, drawing 23 and losing 27. They scored 136 times, conceded 81 and kept 41 clean sheets.|$|E
25|$|The date of Geographica {{is a large}} topic, {{perhaps because}} Strabo worked on it along with his History {{for most of his}} adult life. He {{traveled}} extensively, undoubtedly gathering notes, and made extended visits to Rome and Alexandria, where he <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> to have spent time in the famous library taking notes from his sources.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> of it--I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> of it,' said Uncle Bat; 'but {{everybody}} can't be A1; {{and a man}} can't {{make everybody}} his heir.' ...|$|R

25|$|New {{features}} {{are held in}} public separate source code branches and merged into the main (or development) branch when the GIMP team <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> they won't damage existing functions. Sometimes this means that features that appear complete do not get merged or take months or years before they become available in GIMP.|$|E
25|$|The {{works are}} also a social satire and this {{publication}} will spur renewed interest in his satires. Rotimi <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> {{to be remembered as}} a model in the literary genre whose views have shaped the conduct of the theatre and whose plays have demonstrated the power of drama to shape the thinking of the society and attempted to solve some of the problems encountered in everyday living.|$|E
25|$|Socrates, {{attempting}} to flatter Phaedrus, responds {{that he is}} in ecstasy and that it is all Phaedrus' doing. Socrates comments that as the speech seemed to make Phaedrus radiant, he <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> that Phaedrus understands these things better than he does himself, and that he cannot help follow Phaedrus' lead into his Bacchic frenzy. Phaedrus picks up on Socrates' subtle sarcasm and asks Socrates not to joke.|$|E

25|$|In North America, the Oligarchy {{maintains}} {{power for}} three centuries until the Revolution succeeds and ushers in the Brotherhood of Man. During {{the years of}} the novel, the First Revolt is described and preparations for the Second Revolt are discussed. From the perspective of Everhard, the imminent Second Revolt <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> to succeed but from Meredith's frame story, the reader knows that Ernest Everhard's hopes would go unfulfilled until centuries after his death.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Emperor Octavian, upset that, {{after seven}} years of marriage, his wife has born him no child, weeps to himself in bed. Octavian's wife hears this and tries to comfort him with the {{suggestion}} that they build an abbey and dedicate it to the Virgin Mary. In thanks the Virgin will provide them with a child, she <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> (Octavian became the Roman Emperor Augustus in 27 BC, nearly thirty years before the birth of Christ. Geoffrey Chaucer also transports us back to the age of Augustus in his Book of the Duchess).|$|E
25|$|The {{fighting}} around Croton {{continued in}} 203 BC, but as Livy puts it himself, {{there are no}} clear accounts of the events. Livy is particularly suspicious of a story that the consul Cnaeus Servilius Caepio killed 5,000 Carthaginian soldiers in a pitched battle. One thing <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> – Servilius could not prevent Hannibal from departing safely to Africa. Appian informs that for the transportation of his veterans Hannibal even built more ships {{in addition to the}} fleet that arrived in Croton from Carthage. This was unimpeded by the Romans.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not? I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> I should; I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> I {{should like}} him, and Lady Scatcherd, too. I've {{heard you say}} that she is an {{excellent}} woman." ...|$|R

25|$|He {{comes up}} with all sort of {{theories}} {{about what is happening}} on the island, but finds out the truth when Morel tells the tourists he has been recording their actions of the past week with a machine of his invention, which is capable of reproducing reality. He claims the recording will capture their souls, and through looping they will relive that week forever and he will spend eternity with the woman he loves. Although Morel does not mention her by name, the fugitive <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> he is talking about Faustine.|$|E
25|$|Concurrent {{with the}} sonar readings, the {{floodlit}} camera obtained {{a pair of}} underwater photographs. Both depicted {{what appeared to be}} a rhomboid flipper, although sceptics have dismissed the images as the bottom of the loch, air bubbles, a rock, or a fish fin. The apparent flipper was photographed in different positions, indicating movement. The first flipper photo is better-known than the second, and both were enhanced and retouched from the original negatives. According to team member Charles Wyckoff, the photos were retouched to superimpose the flipper; the original enhancement showed a considerably less-distinct object. No one <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> how the originals were altered.|$|E
25|$|Mattingly and Aaron {{struggle}} {{to find a way}} to turn on the Command Module systems without drawing too much power, and finally transmit the procedure to Swigert, who restarts Odyssey by transferring extra power from Aquarius. When the crew jettisons the Service Module, they are surprised to see the extent of the damage. As they release Aquarius and re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, no one <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> that Odysseys heat shield is intact. The tense period of radio silence due to ionization blackout is longer than normal, but the astronauts report all is well and splash down in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
