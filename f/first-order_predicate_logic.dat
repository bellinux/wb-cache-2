2500|$|Modern {{semantics}} is in {{some ways}} closer to the medieval view, in rejecting such psychological truth-conditions. [...] However, the introduction of quantification, needed {{to solve the problem of}} multiple generality, rendered impossible the kind of subject-predicate analysis that underlies medieval semantics. [...] The main modern approach is model-theoretic semantics, based on Alfred Tarski's semantic theory of truth. [...] The approach assumes that the meaning of the various parts of the propositions are given by the possible ways we can give a recursively specified group of interpretation functions from them to some predefined domain of discourse: an interpretation of <b>first-order</b> <b>predicate</b> <b>logic</b> is given by a mapping from terms to a universe of individuals, and a mapping from propositions to the truth values [...] "true" [...] and [...] "false". [...] Model-theoretic semantics is one of the fundamental concepts of model theory. [...] Modern semantics also admits rival approaches, such as the proof-theoretic semantics that associates the meaning of propositions with the roles that they can play in inferences, an approach that ultimately derives from the work of Gerhard Gentzen on structural proof theory and is heavily influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein's later philosophy, especially his aphorism [...] "meaning is use".|$|E

A fuzzy variation of a classical concept of a category is considered. Then several systems of morphisms loosely based on the crisp categories Rel and Set are defined and examined.

Our approach is a logic-based graded generalization of crisp (clas- sical) category-theoretical approaches to fuzzy sets, which have been initiated by Goguen. ...|$|R

The system defines a programmer’s interface in Racket that makes it easy to harness the power of Z 3 to discover solutions to logical constraints. The interface, although in Racket, retains the structure and brevity of the SMT-LIB format.

This motivates the need of a semantic characterization of P 2 P mappings based not on the extension but {{on the meaning of}} concepts used in the mappings, that is, based on intensional logic.
