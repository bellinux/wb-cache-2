40|$|A first {{space vehicle}} is {{attached}} {{with a second}} space vehicle which includes a rocket propulsion nozzle having a combustion chamber upstream from the nozzle throat. Apparatus 10 includes an elongate <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> 12 extending from the first space vehicle, a pair of inflatable bladders 16, 18 positioned about the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> for engaging an inner surface of the combustion chamber upon inflation. {{and a pair of}} rear bladders 20, 22 positioned about the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> for engaging an inner surface of the nozzle downstream from the combustion chamber upon inflation for aligning the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> and the rocket propulsion nozzle. A pressurized fluid source 24 is provided on the first space vehicle for supplying fluid pressure to the inflatable bladders. and a fluid control valve manifold 30 selectively controls the release of pressurized fluid to the bladders. According to the method of the invention. the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> is inserted into the rocket propulsion nozzle. and the control valves are actuated to first inflate the front bladders and thereby interconnect the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> and the rocket propulsion nozzle. The rear bladders are subsequently inflated to align a central axis of the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> with a central axis of the rocket propulsion nozzle. Inflation of the rear bladders provides an axial reaction load to balance the axial load provided by the front bladders. Attaching the vehicles in space may be controlled from the earth by activating the control valves to inflate the bladders. The cost of attaching space vehicles is significantly reduced by attaching a <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> on one vehicle with the existing rocket propulsion nozzle of another vehicle...|$|R

5000|$|Armed Force - Armed Force is {{a vehicle}} {{with a large}} golden <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> mounted atop it. Gillian had {{intended}} it for Audric, but instead {{he gave it to}} Jayce, when Audric was unable to join the League. It seats two, unlike its toy counterpart. Armed Force's toy counterpart included a gimmick dubbed [...] "Stack n' Attack". Any of the other smaller vehicles could detach their wheeled chassis and attach to the top of Armed Force. (A promotional comic in He-Man magazine showed two vehicles stacked atop Armed Force, though this was physically impossible using the toys, as only Armed Force featured two lined up holes suitable for another vehicle's underside to attach into). This never happens in the show; instead, the phrase [...] "stack n' attack" [...] refers to the Lightning League vehicles being able to exchange weapons mid-battle.

Craig Reed, in Red November: Inside the Secret U.S. - Soviet Submarine War (2010), {{contains}} an inside account of Project Azorian provided by Joe Houston, the senior engineer who designed leading-edge camera systems {{used by the}} Glomar Explorer team to photograph K-129 on the ocean floor. The team needed pictures that offered precise measurements to design the <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> and other systems used to bring the sunken submarine up from the bottom. Houston worked for the mysterious [...] "Mr. P" [...] (John Parangosky) who worked for CIA Deputy Director Carl E. Duckett — the two leaders of Project Azorian. Duckett later worked with Houston at another company, and intimated that the CIA may have recovered much more from the K-129 than admitted to publicly. Reed also details how the mini-sub technology used by the submarine Halibut to find K-129 was used for subsequent Operation Ivy Bells missions to wiretap underwater Soviet communications cables.|$|R

40|$|The Ranger {{program is}} a planned series of low cost {{telerobotics}} flight experiments, based {{on the use of}} Pegasus launch vehicles. As the first step towards this goal, the Space Systems Lab was developing a neutral buoyancy version of Ranger for use in design verification and operations testing. The design approach and results of the Ranger manipulator development program is related. Ranger is designed to incorporate four appendages: a pair of dexterous, seven degree of freedom manipulators for general manipulation; a six DOF <b>grappling</b> <b>arm</b> for securing the vehicle to the local work site; and a five DOF positioning manipulator for the stereo camera pair that provide feedback to the remote operator. Each of these manipulators incorporate unique approaches to satisfying design requirements. The numerical and operational requirements are given for Ranger manipulators, and the evolution is discussed of the differing design approaches based on similarities and differences in the requirements. Testing results for individual joints and manipulator assemblies are presented, followed by initial results of operational testing on satellite servicing tasks with the integrated Ranger neutral buoyancy vehicle...|$|R

50|$|The opening {{contest between}} Gangrel and Al Snow {{began with a}} mixture of head <b>grapples</b> and <b>arm</b> bar take downs. Snow quickly clamped Gangrel and headbutted him, before using Gangrel's legs to throw him over Snow's back. The first {{unsuccessful}} pin count came from a flying crossbody from Snow, the ensuing calm allowing Gangrel to perform a DDT on Snow and then subdue him with clotheslines and a leg sweep. When Gangrel tried to perform a second DDT, though, Snow managed to reverse the hold into a bridged suplex pin. By the time Gangrel had kicked out, The Brood came to ringside and distracted the referee allowing Snow to use Head on Gangrel, but it also gave Edge the opportunity to floor Snow with a missile dropkick which gave the victory to Gangrel.|$|R
25|$|Following the crew's post-sleep activities, the two crews {{set to work}} {{preparing}} for the next day's spacewalk, by moving the S6 truss out of Discovery's payload bay. Due to clearance restrictions, the station's robotic arm {{was not able to}} perform the move by itself, so a series of 'handoffs' were performed to prepare the truss for installation. Phillips and Magnus controlled the station's <b>arm,</b> <b>grappled</b> the truss and moved it into a position where the shuttle's robotic arm, operated by Antonelli, could take possession.|$|R

Using the shuttle's robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), the crew performed a six-hour inspection of the reinforced carbon nose cap and wing leading edge panels of the shuttle. After releasing its grasp on the inspection boom, the robotic <b>arm</b> <b>grappled</b> the ExPRESS Logistics Carrier 1 (ELC1) as a preparatory step for installation on Flight Day 3.|$|R
40|$|The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) {{was made}} among three nation-states, Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Each of these nation-states has {{indigenous}} populations within its borders. Each has chosen different legal mechanisms for interacting with indigenous peoples. For example, the United States has an extensive web of treaties with the tribes within its borders while Canada, in contrast, has relatively few. All three nation-states have <b>grappled</b> with <b>armed</b> conflicts with indigenous peoples {{well into the}} 20 th century. Indigenous peoples within each have long social, cultural, economic, and political histories which cross the borders of these countries. Within the provisions of NAFTA, each nation-state reserved the right to deny investors rights or preferences provided to "aboriginal peoples", "socially or economically disadvantaged minorities", or "socially or economically disadvantaged groups" in from two to five designated areas. All three approaches nevertheless leave substantial national and international legal vacuums that necessarily impact the implementation of NAFTA {{as well as the}} economic interests of indigenous peoples. This paper identifies some of those vacuums, considers their potential impacts and their relationship to negotiations on a Free Trade of the Americas (FTAA) agreement, and discusses possible remedies.

50|$|Hinoshita Toride Kaizan Takenouchi-ryū (日下 捕手 開山 竹内流) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} jujutsu koryū in Japan. It was founded in 1532, the first year of Tenbun, on the twenty-fourth of the sixth lunar month by Takenouchi Chūnagon Daijō Nakatsukasadaiyū Hisamori, the lord of Ichinose Castle in Sakushū. Although it is famous for its jūjutsu, Takenouchi Ryū is {{actually}} a complete system of martial arts including <b>armed</b> <b>grappling</b> (yoroi kumiuchi), staff (bōjutsu), sword (kenjutsu), sword drawing (iaijutsu), glaive (naginatajutsu), iron fan (tessenjutsu), restraining rope (hojōjutsu), and resuscitation techniques (sakkatsuhō). Its jūjutsu techniques have been influential in the founding of many other schools in Japan. Takenouchi Ryū is still actively transmitted today by members of the Takenouchi family, as well as by other groups both within and outside Japan.|$|R
50|$|This led to {{an improvised}} plan which nearly ended the satellite's mission. The {{improvisation}} had the astronaut use his hands to grab hold of a solar array and null the rotation by a push from the Maneuvering Unit's thrusters. Instead, this attempt induced higher rates and in multiple axes; the satellite was tumbling {{out of control and}} quickly losing battery life. SMM Operations Control Center engineers shut down all non-essential satellite subsystems and with a bit of luck were able to recover the satellite minutes before total failure. The ground support engineers then stabilized the satellite and nulled its rotation rates for capture with the Shuttle's robotic arm. This proved to be a much better plan. The satellite had been fitted with one of the <b>arm's</b> <b>grapple</b> fixtures so that the robotic arm was able to capture and maneuver it into the shuttle's payload bay for repairs.|$|R
50|$|Takenouchi Ryū is {{best known}} for its jūjutsu, over which it covers an {{extensive}} ground. Its unarmed jūjutsu techniques include tehodoki (grip breaking), ukemi (tumbling), nagewaza (throwing), kansetsuwaza (joint dislocation), atemi (striking weak points), shimewaza (choking), newaza (ground techniques), and kappō (resuscitation). These are combined to form kata for the various sections of jūjutsu taught, including toride (capturing and restraining), hade (attacking vital points unarmed), and kumiuchi (grappling). These unarmed kata are the best known of the Takenouchi Ryū jūjutsu, but they are not truly its foundation. As related in the establishment myth of the school, the central forms of jūjutsu in Takenouchi Ryū are the kogusoku koshi no mawari, techniques of <b>armed</b> <b>grappling</b> using the short sword kogusoku against armed opponents. It is upon this foundation {{that the rest of the}} jūjutsu techniques were developed by Hisakatsu and Hisayoshi, the second and third heads of the school.|$|R
25|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the day was}} to inspect Atlantiss thermal protection system, using the shuttle's robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) to look for any signs of launch damage. To do so, Commander Ferguson, Pilot Hurley and Mission Specialist Magnus used the shuttle's robotic arm and the OBSS to get a close up look at reinforced carbon–carbon wing leading edges and the nose cap of the shuttle. The robotic <b>arm</b> <b>grappled</b> the OBSS at 6:58a.m. EDT. After raising out the arm-boom assembly, the crew activated the camera and laser sensor package on the boom to first scan the starboard wing. The nose cap was surveyed next followed by the port wing. The gathered visual and electronic data were downlinked during numerous Ku band communication opportunities to the ground. With imagery on their hand, experts began to review the data. The heat shield survey started around 11:00 UTC, was wrapped about five hours later. In his NASA TV commentary, NASA Public Affairs Officer, Rob Navias, said that most of the time, the crew worked ahead of schedule opting to take meals while working. The crew received high praise for their efficient work from the Mission Control Houston including CAPCOM astronaut Stephen Robinson who communicated with them during the survey.|$|R
50|$|Low {{was headed}} due {{northwest}} from the Azores to attack shipping off the British North American colonies. Searching for Low was HMS Greyhound. While cruising off Delaware Bay's mouth, Low and his pirates sighted the man-of-war and gave chase. Low hoisted his Jolly Roger fully suspecting his prey {{to be an}} English whaler but when the pirates drew near, HMS Greyhound revealed herself with the raising of her colors and released a broadside into the Fancy as the pirates were preparing for boarding.Low's schooner took damage and began returning shot while Harris in the Ranger maneuvered into firing position. Ranger opened fire briefly with her guns but {{after only a few}} minutes both the sloop and schooner chose to flee. A running battle then continued for several hours. Fancy was dismasted by well-placed cannon fire but escaped, while Captain Harris in the Ranger was defeated. Wind was not in favor of the pirates, so they used oars to help steer their ships away from the British. The use of oars proved to be pointless when the faster Greyhound came alongside the Ranger and the two crews began skirmishing with small <b>arms.</b> <b>Grappling</b> hooks were thrown and the British sailors boarded the sloop. After a few more moments of intense close-quarters combat the pirates surrendered and were taken prisoner. Captain Low's schooner Fancy is said to have carried around £150,000 in gold during the engagement.|$|R
