40|$|The {{demersal}} fish stock of Wadge Bank {{is one of}} the important fish resources for both Sri Lanka and India. Sivalingam and Medcof (1957) have given an account of its history, general features and relative productivity. According to records the total fishing effort on the bank had been fluctuating and very recently the number of boats operating on the bank has suddenly increased, and {{there is a possibility that}} still more will begin operating on the bank in the near future (Mendis, 1965). The increased fishing effort with the possibility of still further increase calls for proper management practices by those concerned, in order to obtain the maximum sustained yield from the <b>demersal</b> <b>stock.</b> For this purpose a detailed study of the past performance of the fishery is essential. With this in view all records of commercial operations up to 1960 are being analysed by the present author and are to be published in a series.

Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. The European Common Fisheries Policy landing {{obligation}} has introduced significant uncertainty over quota uptake {{in the coming}} years. This year (2016) is {{the first year of}} the {{landing obligation}} for fleets targeting <b>demersal</b> <b>stocks</b> even though it will not be fully introduced across <b>demersal</b> quota <b>stocks</b> until 2019. A recent Seafish economic impact assessment of the landing obligation for UK fleets targeting <b>demersal</b> <b>stocks</b> highlights the challenges facing fleets in the face the landing obligation. Assuming imperfect allocation of quota, that does not reflect catch composition by fleets, in mixed fisheries fleets, quota uptake could be significantly lower than seen in recent history. Not only this, the landing obligation obliges vessels to land all catch. This will see fish not marketable for human consumption landed and sent for fishmeal or bait for example. This paper considers UK whitefish fleets that predominantly target cod, haddock and whiting and presents an economic impact assessment of the effects of CFP policy on not only the fleets but the markets that they provide for. It also considers the conflict between core objectives of achieving MSY and the landing obligation. Bioeconomic modelling is linked to value chain analysis to evaluate a number of scenarios to inform on the impact of European regulation on the competitiveness and sustainability of the UK whitefish sector in the European context. Initial findings suggest that choke species in 2019 will impact supply of fish to markets significantly, impacting fleets and requiring markets to adjust...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} of marine fisheries needs to undergo {{dramatic change in}} the new millennium, {{in response to the}} well-documented evidence of global overfishing and the general depletion of commercial fish stocks. The axioms of sustainable development and equilibrium productivity of wild ecosystems are identified as misleading concepts, which nonetheless underlie current approaches to the {{management of}} living marine resources. Current trends in marine fisheries landings worldwide provide little evidence of sustainability of marine resources under current management paradigms, where biological, economic and social aspects of fisheries are usually treated as different disciplines. While open-access conditions are less widespread than formerly, except for many straddling and highly migratory resources, fishers usually have access to the resource year-round throughout its range.

40|$|The general {{principles}} of fishery management are reviewed.

Management of pelagic fisheries can offer special problems. Many species are wide-ranging, e. g., individual southern 5 luefin can move from Australia to South Africa; thus,fishcries some distance apart may share the same interest.

40|$|In the {{northeast}} Atlantic, management advice for fisheries is usually based on Virtual Population Analysis, yield per recruit, and predictions of catch and biomass. For these calculations, age distributions and weigth-at-age from commercial catches are essential. The process of sampling, age reading, and {{preparation of the}} data is time consuming and expensive. It is therefore important to find the optimum strategy for a sampling program. North-East Arctic cod, haddock and saithe are the three major <b>demersal</b> <b>stocks</b> in Norwegian waters north of 62 °N. Sampling of Norwegian catches in coastal areas are based on 96 statistical units (gear, area, time) for each species. A model was made to simulate the stocks and exploitation in the period 1979 - 1983. The basis for the model was the observation that averaging the length frequency distribution of catches from a statistical unit over some years gave a smooth curve which could be approximated by a LOG-normal distribution. The results indicate that sampling may be omitted {{in most of the}} units without severe consequences for management advice. More length than age sampling is required...|$|R

40|$|Mediterranean young-fish {{oriented}} experimental {{bottom trawl}} surveys represent a precious {{source of information}} on both past and current standing stocks and their life history traits and exploitation state. In the present note, taking {{the occasion of the}} same vessel employed in the South of Sicily (Central Mediterranean), an indirect approach has been implemented to compare MEDITS (Mediterranean International Bottom Trawl Survey) and GRUND (Gruppo Nazionale Demersali) abundance and biological features of the blackmouth catshark Galeus melastomus Rafinesque, 1810 to highlight gear and season effects if any. Data were gathered between 1994 and 2006, in spring-summer (MEDITS) and autumn (GRUND). The density and biomass indexes and occurrences were substantially lower in spring than in autumn.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} acknowledged that body {{weight of fish}} is {{a key factor in}} determining market value of landed catch, thus influencing optimal harvest strategies. However, in management strategy evaluations and bioeconomic modelling body size is often an overlooked economic parameter, and there are no systematic studies on prevalence of size-dependent pricing. Here we assess the presence and magnitude of size-dependent pricing in ex-vessel prices of fish in Norwegian fisheries. The data encompass landings of four pelagic and four <b>demersal</b> <b>stocks</b> in Norway in 2000 - 2010. Linear mixed models and generalized additive models were used to determine the dependence of unit price on weight class as well as on total yield and time (year). The results show a significant positive relationship between weight class and price for seven out of the eight examined fish stocks. The relative effect of body weight on price was the strongest for cod, Greenland halibut, Norwegian spring-spawning herring and mackerel, lesser for North Sea herring and saithe, and negligible for horse mackerel. These findings demonstrate that size-dependent pricing is common in Norwegian fisheries, and is therefore of high relevance for resource economics and fisheries management...|$|R
40|$|The Northeast Atlantic sustains {{a number}} of pelagic fish stocks, the most {{important}} of which are Norwegian Spring Spawning (NSS) herring, Northeast Atlantic blue whiting and Northeast Atlantic mackerel. The stocks are located in Russian, Norwegian, Icelandic, Faroese and EU waters, but the large scale distribution pattern varies and is related to total stock sizes and water temperatures. All stocks are classified as straddling stocks {{in the sense that they}} not only cross boundaries between the EEZs of coastal states, but also traverse the high seas areas between those boundaries. The migratory patterns of these stocks have undoubtedly made it more difficult to attain and to uphold international agreements on catch quotas. While agreements on less migratory <b>demersal</b> <b>stocks</b> (cod and haddock, for example) between Russia and Norway have remained unchanged since the early 1980 s, the agreements on the pelagic stocks have sometimes broken down or taken long time to establis.

40|$|Management of the Mediterranean <b>demersal</b> <b>stocks</b> {{has proven}} {{challenging}} mainly {{due to the}} multi-species character of the fisheries. In the present work, {{we focus on the}} multi-species demersal fisheries of the Aegean Sea (eastern Mediterranean) aiming to study the effects of different management measures on the main commercial stocks, as well as to explore the economic viability of the fisheries depending upon these resources, by means of simulated projections. Utilizing the limited available data, our results demonstrated that, under the current exploitation pattern, the economic viability of the fleets is threatened, particularly if fuel prices increase. Additionally, the biological targets set for the most exploited species, such as hake, will not be met under the current management regime. The projections also showed that the only management scenario under which both resource sustainability and economic viability of the fisheries are ensured is the decrease of fleet capacity in terms of vessel numbers. In this case, however, measures to support the fisheries-dependent communities need to be implemented to prevent the collapse of local economies due to employment decrease. Scenarios assuming selectivity improvements would be also beneficial for the stocks but they showed low economic performance and their application would threaten the viability of the fleets, particularly that of the trawlers...|$|R
40|$|Achieving single species maximum {{sustainable}} yield (MSY) {{in complex}} and dynamic fisheries targeting multiple species (mixed fisheries) is challenging because achieving the objective for one species may mean missing the objective for another. The North Sea mixed fisheries are a representative example of {{an issue that is}} generic across most demersal fisheries worldwide, with the diversity of species and fisheries inducing numerous biological and technical interactions. Building on a rich knowledge base for the understanding and quantification of these interactions, new approaches have emerged.
