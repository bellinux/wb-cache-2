5|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} claimants to the Duchy {{began to see}} that Sforza would be a greater threat than the Ambrosian Republic. Louis of Savoy invaded in spring of 1449, and Sforza sent Colleoni (who had earlier defected) to defeat him at Borgomanero, leading to an uneasy peace. Sforza also faced treachery within his own ranks, added {{with the fact that he}} rashly {{accepted}} the defection of his great enemies the Piccinino brothers, who, upon <b>gaining</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Monza, promptly returned it to Milan.|$|E

5|$|Like {{traditional}} role-playing games, Kingdom Hearts {{features an}} experience point system that determines character development. As enemies are defeated, the player characters gain experience and grow stronger, <b>gaining</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> new abilities. Unlike other games of its type, Kingdom Hearts allows {{a degree of}} character development customization through a short tutorial found {{at the beginning of}} the game. The tutorial allows the player to select from one of three main attributes―strength, defense, or magic―for Sora to excel in and one to lack in. By choosing certain options, the player may manipulate how Sora learns abilities, grows statistically, and gains levels. Donald, Goofy, and any other additional party members are assigned specific areas of strength from the outset. Donald excels in magic, while Goofy excels in defense and special attacks.|$|E
5|$|People {{living in}} areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS face several {{psychological}} barriers when deciding whether to undergo testing for HIV. For example, people may prefer not {{to know if they}} are HIV-positive because, due to the obstacles they often face in <b>gaining</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> antiretroviral drugs, many view HIV/AIDS diagnoses as death sentences. Others may simply believe that they are HIV-negative, either because they practice strict monogamy and consistently use condoms during sexual intercourse or because they are in denial about the prevalence of the disease. However, despite these barriers, both mobile and static testing services have become more widely available in Malawi recently: 1,392 testing and counseling sites existed in 2011. Certain non-governmental organization such as the Malawi AIDS Counseling and Resource Organisation (MACRO) provide door-to-door counseling and testing services, which have drastically improved the accessibility of HIV testing.|$|E
5|$|This dual rule {{eventually}} {{failed and}} the two waged a new civil war further diminishing {{what was left of}} Byzantium's integrity in the eyes of her troublesome neighbors. John VI Cantacuzenus emerged triumphant once again and replaced the now exiled John V Palaeologus with his son Matthew Cantacuzenus as junior co-emperor. However, the Turks, under Osman I's son, Orhan I, now came into play by capturing the fort of Kallipolis (Gallipoli) in 1354 and <b>gaining</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the European mainland. The arrival of the seemingly unbeatable Ottoman soldiers surrounding Constantinople caused a panic in Constantinople, capitalized by John V who, {{with the assistance of the}} Genoese, staged a coup and ousted John VI Cantacuzenus in November 1354. As a result, John VI would later become a monk.|$|E

He then destroys a robotics facility on the icy planet Anteevy, {{the second stage of}} the Dark Trooper production line. After being captured by Jabba the Hutt and having to escape his ship, Katarn infiltrates a computer vault on Coruscant which reveals the location of the Ergo fuel station, the final stage in the smuggling route.

5|$|Amidst {{the flames}} and rubble, Arenberg's and Ferdinand's troops tried to storm the castle, but {{found their way}} blocked by masses of debris created by their own explosives. Furthermore, {{although}} close to half of the garrison had perished in the explosion and subsequent collapse of the fortifications, those who remained offered staunch resistance by throwing rocks on the approaching attackers, causing {{a large number of}} casualties. In frustration, 40 or 50 of the attackers tied together two ladders and crawled through the sluice-ways of the garderobe (latrines) that emptied on the hillside, thus <b>gaining</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the interior of the castle. There they killed around 20 of the defenders in fierce fighting; the remaining defenders, approximately 70 men, among them Buchner and Sudermann, the garrison commander and his lieutenant, sought refuge in the castle's keep. In this way, Ferdinand's infantry at last gained unopposed access to the fortress. Storming the castle had taken about two hours.|$|E
5|$|In Wings of Liberty, Narud and the Moebius Foundation backed Tychus Findlay's {{contact with}} James Raynor {{as a way}} to get around an {{imperial}} decree from Arcturus Mengsk which made it illegal to traffic in alien goods. Narud would later appear by proxy as the Moebius Foundation's representative during a mission briefing on Tyrador, wherein Narud lent James Raynor his medical transport ships to help Raynor destroy the foundation's data cores in order to prevent the Queen of Blades from <b>gaining</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> them. On the eve of the invasion of Char, Raynor learned from Valerian that Narud had been working with the Dominion's Crown Prince for the entire duration of the game. In the aftermath of the successful de-infestation of the Queen of Blades, a civil war erupts between Arcturus and Valerian; in an attempt to find a safe haven, Valerian and Raynor seek shelter with the Moebius Foundation. Initially, Narud greeted and temporarily sheltered the group, but after examining the Xel'Naga artifact and thoroughly questioning Raynor about Kerrigan, Narud revealed his allegiance to Arcturus and sold out the group to an incoming Dominion fleet, but the fleet's attempt to kill Kerrigan fails.|$|E

5|$|In {{the hope}} of <b>gaining</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the {{state-of-the-art}} resources of Caltech for their rocketry research, Parsons and Forman attended a lecture {{on the work of}} Austrian rocket engineer Eugen Sänger and hypothetical above-stratospheric aircraft by the institute's William Bollay— a PhD student specializing in rocket-powered aircraft—and approached him to express their interest in designing a liquid-fuel rocket motor. Bollay redirected them to another PhD student named Frank Malina, a mathematician and mechanical engineer composing a thesis on rocket propulsion who shared their interests and soon befriended the pair. Parsons, Forman, and Malina applied for funding from Caltech together; they did not mention that their ultimate objective was to develop rockets for space exploration, realizing that most of the scientific establishment then relegated such ideas to science fiction. While Caltech's Clark Blanchard Millikan immediately rebuffed them, Malina's doctoral advisor Theodore von Kármán saw more promise in their proposal and agreed to allow them to operate {{under the auspices of the}} university's Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory (GALCIT). Naming themselves the GALCIT Rocket Research Group, they gained access to Caltech's specialist equipment, though the economics of the Great Depression left von Kármán unable to finance them.|$|E
5|$|The area {{surrounding}} Bodiam Castle was landscaped {{when the}} castle was built, {{to increase its}} aesthetic appeal. Archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham have described Bodiam {{as one of the}} best examples of landscaping to emphasise a castle. The water features were originally extensive, but only the moat survives, along with the earthworks left over from its construction. Roughly rectangular, the moat is supplied by several springs, some of them within it, which made it difficult to drain during the excavations of the 1930s. A moat can prevent attackers from <b>gaining</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the base of a castle's walls, but in the case of Bodiam it also had the effect of making the castle appear larger and more impressive by isolating it in its landscape. The moat is now regarded more as an ornamental feature than a defence. The approach to the castle through the moat and satellite ponds was indirect, giving visitors time to view the castle in its intended splendour. Military historian Cathcart King describes the approach as formidable, and considers it the equal of the 13th-century castles of Edward I in Wales, such as Caerphilly Castle.|$|E

Miley and Stewie quickly become best friends and they sing a song which Stewie wrote. Soon, Chris realizes that the Monkey has {{spent more time with}} him, like taking him to play baseball and going to a father and son BBQ in Monkeykid. Chris then says to Peter that he has never gave as much attention to him as the monkey has, so he grows to resent his own father. While having ice-cream with Miley, Stewie notices a signal interference on her cell phone when handing it to her. He then realises something is strange about Miley. Upon spying on her, Stewie and Brian discover that she is actually an android after seeing an employee insert a USB drive on the control panel on Miley's back. They both realized that Miley was created by Walt Disney Imagineering to become the perfect teen idol that can never fail. When Brian curiously asks if she can perform other tasks, Stewie agrees to reprogram Miley to have sex with Brian by <b>gaining</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the control panel.
