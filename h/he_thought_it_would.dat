5|$|Brown {{called his}} new {{franchise}} the Bengals because Cincinnati had {{a team of}} that name in the 1930s and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> provide {{a link to the}} past. Brown's son Mike joined the front office and became his father's top assistant and right-hand man. Brown brought in other assistants including Bill Johnson, Rick Forzano and Bill Walsh. In their first two seasons in 1968 and 1969, the Bengals fared poorly, but the team appeared to be on the upswing as Brown built up a core group of players through the draft, including quarterback Greg Cook.|$|E
5|$|Ingels {{was born}} in Copenhagen in 1974 to an {{engineer}} father and a dentist mother. Hoping to become a cartoonist, he began to study architecture in 1993 at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> help him to improve his drawing skills. Only {{after he had been}} studying for a couple of years, did he really take an interest in architecture. He continued his studies at the Escola Tècnica Superior d'Arquitectura in Barcelona, and returned to Copenhagen to receive his diploma in 1999. As a third-year student in Barcelona, he set up his first practice and won his first competition.|$|E
5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. He only spent little time on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the first game's story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix's personality as he went along. He came up with the partner character Maya because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own.|$|E
60|$|He set his teeth. It {{was just}} as bad as <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be.|$|R

5|$|Botha, who {{had been}} asked by the Union's first Governor-General Viscount Gladstone to form a government, began to make {{policies}} and speeches that appeared to Coghlan to be unfair to South Africans of British origin. The Attorney-General J. B. M. Hertzog interpreted the convention {{in a way that}} Coghlan considered to be to the detriment of English-speakers. Coghlan came to the conclusion in 1910 that Southern Rhodesia's joining the Union was much further off than he had previously thought, though he still saw it as the territory's inevitable destiny, whose timing and terms the local electorate must determine. At this time, he rejected the notion of responsible government—self-government while retaining colonial status—on the grounds that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take up to two decades to achieve. He was furthermore against the idea of keeping Rhodesia for English-speaking settlers, seeing in that end the same racial discrimination he perceived the Dutch-speakers to be displaying against the British in the Union.|$|E
5|$|Christian Tuxen Falbe, a Danish marine officer, was in Paris in January 1839 {{on behalf}} of Crown Prince Frederik when Louis Daguerre {{revealed}} the art of daguerreotyping. Falbe informed the Crown Prince of a visit to Daguerre where he had {{seen some of the}} very earliest daguerreotypes, explaining how impressed he had been by the new process and how important <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be for art and science in Denmark. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Copenhagen with a camera and a couple of his own daguerreotypes for the Crown Prince who, believing them to be of scientific importance, deposited them with Hans Christian Ørsted, one of Denmark's most prominent scientists. As a result of Ørsted's own interest in photography, the new art took on rapidly: the daguerreotypist Mads Alstrup (1809–76) opened Copenhagen's first photographic studio in 1842; and by 1850 there were over a hundred studios in Copenhagen and many more in the provinces.|$|E
25|$|The main {{favourite}} was (then) six-time winner Armstrong (now {{stripped of}} all his victories). Armstrong had had doubts if he should start the 2005 Tour, but decided in February 2005 that he would race. His main rival Ullrich was happy with this decision, as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a better race with Armstrong present.|$|E

60|$|And so D'Arnot {{commenced}} at once, {{pointing out}} familiar objects and repeating {{their names in}} French, for <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be easier to teach this man his own language, since he understood it himself best of all.|$|R
25|$|Sun Quan {{considered}} that Cao Cao {{was still a}} threat in the north, so <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be better {{for him to have}} more allies instead of creating hostility between him and Liu Bei. Besides, he was also worried that Liu Bei's men might not submit to him, so he rejected Zhou Yu's idea.|$|E
25|$|For Medical Tales Retold, Seluk draws comics about unusual or {{touching}} {{stories he}} gets through his email. These stories are about illnesses and injuries {{and can be}} sent in by doctors or patients. The concept of Medical Tales Retold came up in collaboration with Tapastic. After Seluk saw an artist illustrate personal love stories through Tapastic, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be a good idea}} to normalize unusual medical stories through humor.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, after Ozzy Osbourne had {{finished}} recording the Ozzmosis album, {{a replacement for}} Zakk Wylde was needed for the tour. While working on his own band, Joe {{got a call from}} Deen Castronovo (Ozzy's drummer) to let him know they were seeking a guitar player. Joe went down to Audible Studios in Los Angeles and played three Ozzy classics. Holmes did not mention that he had taken lessons from Randy Rhoads (former guitarist for Osbourne) as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> hurt his chances at the job. He succeeded though and got the part.|$|E

25|$|From the {{earliest}} days of the Nazi takeover in Germany, the Vatican was taking diplomatic action to attempt to defend the Jews of Germany. In the spring of 1933, Pope Pius XI urged Mussolini to ask Hitler to restrain the anti-Semitic actions taking place in Germany. Mussolini urged Pius to excommunicate Hitler, as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> render him less powerful in Catholic Austria and reduce the danger to Italy and wider Europe. The Vatican refused to comply and thereafter Mussolini began to work with Hitler, adopting his anti-Semitic and race theories. In 1936, with the Church in Germany facing clear persecution, Italy and Germany agreed to the Berlin-Rome Axis.|$|E

According to Washington Jewish Week, Lieberman called her for a date because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be {{interesting}} to go out with someone named Hadassah. (Hadassah {{is the name of the}} Women's Zionist Organization of America). Since March 2005, Hadassah Lieberman has worked for Hill & Knowlton, a lobbying firm based in New York City, as a senior counselor in its health and pharmaceuticals practice. She has held senior positions at the Hospital of Saint Raphael in New Haven, the American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International (APCO), Pfizer, National Research Council, Hoffmann-La Roche, and Lehman Brothers.|$|E
25|$|Although Drottning Kristina och Monaldeschi was popular, Höckert rose to fame in 1855 {{with his}} {{painting}} Gudstjänst i Lövmokks fjällkapell (English: Worship service in Lövmokk's fell chapel). It {{was inspired by}} a sketch Höckert had made while traveling in Lapland, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> draw attention to itself. The painting was put on display at the 1855 World's Fair in Paris, and Höckert was awarded with a gold medal for it. French critics characterized it as a piece of French art, commenting that Höckert was most likely influenced by Eugène Delacroix and Thomas Couture. The painting was then bought by Napoleon III of France and was given to the art museum in Lille. Its current home is the National Museum of Arts in Sweden. At this time, Höckert became recognized as one of Sweden's foremost figure painters.|$|E
60|$|But {{over in the}} old Briar-patch that {{afternoon}} Peter Rabbit sat very thoughtful and very much ashamed. The <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> had found out where Chatterer's new house was didn't give him the pleasure that <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would.</b> His ears still burned, for <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that Chatterer supposed him honest when he wasn't.|$|R

"She {{is quite}} right in that," [...] said the archdeacon; {{and then he}} paused again. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be best {{for him to make}} a clean breast of it, and to trust to Lady Lufton's sympathy.

50|$|Black told Billboard that Joe Galante, {{then the}} {{chairman}} of RCA Records, suggested that he record a duet, because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be a good time}} in Black's career for him to release one.

25|$|To hear Edward's voice, Bella {{attempts}} cliff-diving {{and nearly}} drowns, {{but she is}} saved by Jacob. Edward, after mistakenly being informed that Bella has committed suicide, travels to Volterra, Italy, to request the Volturi to destroy him. Alice returns to Forks and discovers Bella is alive; she and Bella pursue Edward to Italy and successfully prevent him from showing himself in daylight to humans, an act {{that would result in}} his execution. The trio are taken to the Volturi. Because Bella knows about vampires, the Volturi want to kill her, but Alice claims she has foreseen Bella becoming a vampire. Because most humans are unaware that vampires exist, the Volturi threaten to kill Bella if this does not happen soon. Upon returning home, Edward tells Bella that he never stopped loving her, and he only left Forks because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> protect her. He apologizes for his misguided action and asks for her forgiveness, which Bella quickly grants. Bella, intent on becoming a vampire, decides that Edward's family should vote on her fate. All but Rosalie and Edward vote for her to be changed, but Edward agrees to change her himself if she will marry him.|$|E
25|$|Giuliani {{said his}} {{political}} career was not necessarily over, and did not rule out a 2010 New York gubernatorial or 2012 presidential bid. A November 2008 Siena College poll indicated that although Governor David Paterson—promoted to the office via the Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal a year before—was popular among New Yorkers, he would have just a slight lead over Giuliani in a hypothetical matchup. By February 2009, after the prolonged Senate appointment process, a Siena College poll indicated that Paterson was losing popularity among New Yorkers, and showed Giuliani with a fifteen-point lead in the hypothetical contest. In January 2009, Giuliani {{said he would not}} decide on a gubernatorial run for another six to eight months, adding that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not be fair to the governor to start campaigning early while the governor tries to focus on his job. Giuliani worked to retire his presidential campaign debt, {{but by the end of}} March 2009 it was still $2.4 million in arrears, the largest such remaining amount for any of the 2008 contenders. In April 2009, Giuliani strongly opposed Paterson's announced push for same-sex marriage in New York and said it would likely cause a backlash that could put Republicans in statewide office in 2010. By late August 2009, there were still conflicting reports about whether Giuliani was likely to run.|$|E
25|$|On the May 20 {{edition of}} Impact! Joe was ranked number {{ten in the}} first ever TNA Championship Committee rankings for a World Heavyweight Championship title shot. He began his climb up the rankings by {{defeating}} Hernandez on June 17, number four ranked A.J. Styles on July 1 and by wrestling number two ranked Jeff Hardy to a ten-minute time limit draw on the July 22 edition of Impact!. After the match with Hardy, Joe was upset with the production crew for starting a countdown to the time limit draw, when Joe specifically requested not to start one because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> reveal {{the ending of the}} match early. Because of his outburst, Joe was suspended from TNA indefinitely. Joe returned from his suspension on August 23 at the tapings of the August 26 edition of Impact! to defeat Orlando Jordan. The following week on Impact!, Joe aligned himself with Jeff Jarrett and Hulk Hogan in their war with Sting and Kevin Nash. At No Surrender Joe and Jarrett defeated Sting and Nash in a tag team match, when Joe choked out Sting, after Jarrett had hit him with his baseball bat behind Joe's back. At Bound for Glory Joe and Jarrett faced Sting, Nash and their newest ally D'Angelo Dinero in a handicap match, after Hulk Hogan, who was scheduled to team with Joe and Jarrett, was forced to pull out due to a back surgery. At the end of the match Jarrett abandoned Joe and left him to be pinned by Nash. Later in the night it was revealed that Hogan was in fact in the building as he helped Jeff Hardy win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and formed a new heel alliance with Hardy, Eric Bischoff, Jeff Jarrett and Abyss.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} reasons for showing Oscar's head and {{shoulders}} within the frame during the flashback scenes, rather than letting the camera be the character's eyes.
