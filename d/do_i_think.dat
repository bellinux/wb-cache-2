500|$|Ferdinando {{rejected}} it outright with the fullest support of Louis XIV, his great-uncle. Cosimo's eyes now fell upon Violente of Bavaria. Choosing her would strengthen ties between France—where Violente's sister was the dauphine—and Bavaria. There {{was only one}} obstacle in the way, Ferdinando II, Cosimo's father, impartially advised Violente's father, Ferdinand Maria, to invest a huge sum into a bank. Soon after the Elector deposited the sum, the bank collapsed. Ferdinand Maria still had sore feelings; Cosimo consented to the reduction of her dowry accordingly to reimburse the Elector. Ferdinando was unimpressed with his wife. Violente, however, electrified the Grand Duke. He wrote, [...] "I have never known, nor <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the world can produce, a disposition so perfect..." ...|$|E
500|$|Spanish {{critic and}} philosopher Miguel de Unamuno {{comments}} of the book, [...] "I never took Facundo by Sarmiento {{as a historical}} work, nor <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it can be very}} valued in that regard. I always thought of it as a literary work, as a historical novel". However, Facundo cannot be classified as a novel or a specific genre of literature. According to González Echevarría, the book is at once an [...] "essay, biography, autobiography, novel, epic, memoir, confession, political pamphlet, diatribe, scientific treatise, [...] travelogue". Sarmiento's style and his exploration of the life of Facundo unify the three distinct parts of his work. Even the first section, describing Argentina's geography, follows this pattern, since Sarmiento contends that Facundo is a natural product of this environment.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} acquire Violante Beatrice's {{hand for the}} Grand Prince, Cosimo was obliged to reimburse Ferdinand Maria's son Maximilian II. With this {{obstacle}} surmounted, the marriage contract was signed on 24 May 1688, granting Violante Beatrice a dowry of 400,000 thalers in cash and the same amount in jewellery. She married the Grand Prince by proxy in Munich on 21 November 1688 and was married in person on 9 January 1689. The wedding reception {{was held at the}} Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence. The new Grand Princess was instantly enamoured with the bridegroom, {{in spite of the fact}} he loathed her.

Although Barkley openly admits to his problem, he claims it is not serious since he can afford to support the habit.

500|$|Kelly West of TV Blend {{was also}} {{critical}} of the episode, writing: [...] "I don't think based on the first episode that {{we can say that}} Grey's is headed in a new direction, nor <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the writers are making much of an effort to bring the series back to the greatness that was its earlier seasons.

In April 2012, despite Ruffalo being on board to play the Hulk in the sequel, Feige confirmed to Collider that Marvel had no plans at that time to film another Hulk film. In a Q session, Feige and Ruffalo confirmed that discussions are underway to produce another Hulk film due to the positive audience response to Ruffalo's performance in The Avengers. In September 2012, Feige, while exploring all possible story options for a sequel film, including a film based on the [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] and [...] "World War Hulk" [...] storylines, stated, [...] "everything [...] is on the table. <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in Avengers?

500|$|The season {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} among television critics.

Although [...] "Sympathy for the Parents" [...] was the least viewed episode, TV Fanatic called the episode [...] "touching", praising Chambers' performance. TV Fanatics reaction to the season was fairly mixed, with Steve Marsi saying that Grey's Anatomy was facing an identity crisis after viewing [...] "Give Peace a Chance". He said that: [...] "Still popular but lacking its past magic, it's trying to decide what to become. All we can say is that if it becomes what we saw 12 hours ago, we are all for it. Last week saw the doctors plunging into ER-style chaos with 12 different doctors giving 12 different accounts of one case. Last night, we saw something else equally unusual." [...] He praised Patrick Dempsey's performance, saying: [...] "Again, it was a single case that took up the entire hour, but instead of 12 doctors' version of events, the focus was largely on just one, and the best one: Dr. Derek Shepherd. Patrick Dempsey's McDreamy character may be eye candy, but he's got substance. Last night's episode proved that in spades, and was one of the series' best in some time." ...|$|E
