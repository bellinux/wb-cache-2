500|$|During {{the latter}} half of 2005, Working Title {{approached}} several towns in South West England looking for an appropriate filming location. Pegg commented, [...] "We're both [...] from the West Country so it just seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in Frome". Stow-on-the-Wold was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon Wells in Somerset, Wright's hometown, of which he has said [...] "I love it but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> trash it". Wells Cathedral was digitally painted out of every shot of the cathedral city, as Wright wanted the Church of St. Cuthbert to be the centre building for the fictional town of Sandford; however, the Bishop's Palace is identifiable in some shots (and was itself used as the setting for some scenes). While shooting scenes in their uniforms, Pegg and Frost were often mistaken for genuine police officers and asked for directions by passers-by. Filming also took place at the Hendon Police College, including the driving school skid pan and athletic track. Filming commenced on 19 March 2006 and lasted for eleven weeks. After editing, Wright ended up cutting half an hour of footage from the film.|$|E

6000|$|Very welcome, very delightful, to me {{your kind}} New Year's message, and meeting a solicitude (for news of you both) {{which was as}} a shadow across my (not very glowing indeed) Christmas hearth. Your note finds me still incorrigibly rustic; I have been {{spending}} here the most solitary Christmas-tide of my life (absolutely solitary) and I have not, for long months, been further from home than for an occasional day or two in London. I go there on the 10th to remain till May; but I am sorry to say I see little hope of my being able to peregrinate to far Provence--all benignant though your invitation be. We must meet--some time!--again in the loved Italy; but I blush, almost, to say it, when I have to say {{at the same time}} that my present prospect of that bliss is of the smallest. I long unspeakably to go back there--before I descend into the dark deep tomb--for a long visit (of upwards of a year); yet it proves more difficult for me than it ought, or than it looks, and, in short, I oughtn't to speak of it again save to announce it as definite. Unfortunately <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> return for a succession of months to the land of my birth--also in anticipation of the tomb; and the one doesn't help the other. Europe has ceased to be romantic to me, and my own country, in the evening of my days, has become so; but this senile passion too is perhaps condemned to remain platonic.--Bourget's benevolence continues to shine on me, his generosity to descend, in the form of heavenly-blue volumes, the grave smile of my dull library shelves, for which I blush that I make so meagre returns. I shall send you a volume in February, but it will have no such grande allure; though the best thing in it will be a little story of which you gave me long ago, at Torquay, the motive, and which I will mark. I congratulate you on not being absentees from your high-walled--or much-walled--Eden, and I hope it means a happy distillation for Bourget and much health and peace for both of you. May you have a mild and merciful year! Deserve it by continuing to have patience tous les deux with your very faithful (and very inky) old friend, ...|$|E

60|$|From the hush {{of these}} places, it is congenial to {{pass into the}} hushed resorts of business. Down the lanes I {{like to see the}} carts and waggons huddled {{together}} in repose, the cranes idle, and the warehouses shut. Pausing in the alleys behind the closed Banks of mighty Lombard-street, it gives one as good as a rich feeling to think of the broad counters with a rim along the edge, made for telling money out on, the scales for weighing precious metals, the ponderous ledgers, and, above all, the bright copper shovels for shovelling gold. When I draw money, it never seems so much money as when it is shovelled at me out of a bright copper shovel. I like to say, 'In gold,' and to see seven pounds musically pouring out of the shovel, like seventy; the Bank appearing to remark to me--I italicise APPEARING--'if you want more of this yellow earth, we keep it in barrows at your service.' To think of the banker's clerk with his deft finger turning the crisp edges of the Hundred- Pound Notes he has taken in a fat roll out of a drawer, is again to hear the rustling of that delicious south-cash wind. 'How will you have it?' I once heard this usual question asked at a Bank Counter of an elderly female, habited in mourning and steeped in simplicity, who answered, open-eyed, crook-fingered, laughing with expectation, 'Anyhow!' Calling these things to mind as I stroll among the Banks, I wonder whether the other solitary Sunday man I pass, has designs upon the Banks. For the interest and mystery of the matter, I almost hope he may have, and that his confederate may be at this moment taking impressions of the keys of the iron closets in wax, and that a delightful robbery may be in course of transaction. About College-hill, Mark-lane, and so on towards the Tower, and Dockward, the deserted wine-merchants' cellars are fine subjects for consideration; but the deserted money-cellars of the Bankers, and their plate-cellars, and their jewel-cellars, what subterranean regions of the Wonderful Lamp are these! And again: possibly some shoeless boy in rags, passed through this street yesterday, for whom it is reserved to be a Banker in the fulness of time, and to be surpassing rich. Such reverses have been, since the days of Whittington; and were, long before. I want to know whether the boy has any foreglittering of that glittering fortune now, when he treads these stones, hungry. Much as <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know whether the next man to be hanged at Newgate yonder, had any suspicion upon him that he was moving steadily towards that fate, when he talked so much about the last man who paid the same great debt at the same small Debtors' Door.|$|E

40|$|There {{are three}} types of foragers: sit-and-wait predators, hunting predators, and optimal foragers.

I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see if green frogs forage more actively during the daytime or at nighttime. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see what type of foraging method did the frogs convey and why? <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see if the frogs portrayed any type of competition, {{and if they did}} if it was exploitative or interference competition. I hypothesized that the green frogs wil hunt for their food during the daytime and display exploitative competition. I found out that the green frogs are sit-and-wait predators during the day but hunting predators at night. Therefore, they are more active during the night. During both day and night, the frogs showed the less aggressive act of exploitative competition. The results supported by hypothesis that the frogs are hunting predators and show exploitative competition; but refuted that the frogs forage during the day...|$|R
