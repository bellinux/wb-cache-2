5000|$|The court made {{an order}} to use {{predictive}} coding in assisting electronic disclosure in several stages. Firstly, the court issued a direction to identify the issues for the Section 994 of Companies Act petition to limit the scope of documents searches relevant to trial and, therefore, may reduce time and costs. It was because the petition illustrated broad issues of the dispute. Thus, both parties must investigate and discuss the relevant issues and files − including the source and site - <b>general</b> <b>disclosure</b> process, and the criteria. Also, the parties may ask the court again regarding {{the process of the}} standard of disclosure, if needed. The court also declared that proposed protocol by the Technology and Construction Court would be helpful in the electronic disclosure and Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) Practice Direction (PD) 31B (paragraph 8 and 9) must be complied. Secondly, if the first direction had been done, the court believed that “predictive coding must be way forward”. The court applied the ten factors in favouring predictive coding in Pyrrho Investments Ltd v MWB Property Ltd. Except for one neutral factor (no provision in CPR and practices prohibits such use) and one non-suitable factor (as the predictive coding process was agreed in that case), the other factors would support the use of such software in this case. The court further recognised that majority files were in possession of the respondents and the significance of the cost difference between both methods which made the price for predictive coding was considerably cheaper. Even though the cost was not the only deciding factor, the court understood that there was also no counter-argument had stated that such new method would be less effective in providing electronic disclosure. Furthermore, the court also noticed the rise of some suspicion towards the effectiveness of this method. Thus, it is urged that both parties must strive to obtain the sensible and proportionate outcome.|$|E

In theory, SNSs can be a helpful tool for immigrants, because they may help establish social ties in the destination country and help maintain ties with people in the country of origin. We examine whether this is also true in practice by analyzing whether the frequency of using two SNSs—Facebook and Hyves (a Dutch SNS) —is associated with the number of ingroup and outgroup ties, as well as the quality of social relations. In addition, we test whether <b>general</b> emotional <b>disclosure</b> boosts the effect of SNS usage on the quality of relationships. We find that SNS usage is associated with more outgroup ties, but not with more ingroup ties.

Design/methodology/approach: This study develops hypotheses with the light of legitimacy and signalling theory using top 200 firms listed on the Dhaka Stock Exchange, Bangladesh. Corporate social disclosure (CSD) data are based on the period from 2011 to 2013, and the firm performance (FP) is based on the respective following year 2012 to 2014. A corporate social disclosure index (CSDI) including three categories (long-term, short- term and <b>general</b> <b>disclosure)</b> is constructed to measure the extent of social disclosures in annual reports. Firm performance is measured based on three indicators including Return on Asset (ROA), Market Capitalization, and Tobin Q. Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Two Stage Least Square (2 SLS) are used in analysing the data. Findings: It is found that there is a significant relationship between corporate social disclosure and the following year 2 ̆ 7 s firm performance for every performance indicator. It is also found that long-term disclosure {{plays a key role in}} influencing the firm performance. Originality/ value: CSD is country-specific and, hence, the effects of corporate social disclosure on firm performance can vary from country to country.

40|$|From 2003 when LinkedIn was {{launched}} and 2004 when Facebook started, online Social Networking Services (SNSs) {{have emerged as}} a major means of communication for social and business communities. Users enter into an agreement with providers when they sign up to online SNSs. In exchange {{for access to the}} features and facilities offered by the SNS, users allow exploitation of their personal data by the service provider. This is not always clear to users at the time and there is a widely-held perception that users are not adequately protected. In the UK, the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Communications Act 2003 provide regulatory frameworks for online services. This research sets out to test the hypothesis that law-based regulation alone does not provide adequate protection to users against the risks associated with use of SNSs. This research looks at the mechanisms by which a law-based regulatory framework has been put in place in the UK and compares this with other modes of regulation: self-regulation; regulation by design; and regulation by the way in which users behave. For instance, self-regulation occurs when SNS providers implement privacy policies. An example of design-based regulation occurs when SNSs have data encryption built into the development of their services to protect against unauthorised access to personal data. Users’ behaviour regulates services by means of market pressure and by adopting safe practices such as opting out of <b>general</b> <b>disclosure</b> of personal data, for instance. This research analyses the effectiveness of these four regulatory modes (Law, self-regulation, design and user behaviour) by assessing their impact on risk to users. The research also examines attitudes of different stakeholders to the regulatory modes identified. The response of SNS providers {{and the extent to which}} they are influenced by legislation gives an alternative perspective on the effectiveness of legislation as a means of regulation...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{motivated}} {{by the introduction of}} mandatory carbon reporting by UK Government under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic and Directors’ Reports). Before the enactment of this regulation, there are several carbon reporting guidance that aim to improve the reporting of carbon emissions by UK companies such as the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), GRI (2013), WBCSD and WRI (2004). This raises the question that why further governmental intervention is initiated in carbon reporting despite of the existing institutionalized reporting guidance. Using a self-constructed disclosure index, this paper attempts to assess the quality of the longitudinal development of corporate carbon emission disclosure, to study to what extent companies disclose their carbon emission information and to examine whether these companies are using carbon emission disclosures as a legitimacy tool in response to the launch of legally binding carbon reduction schemes such as the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and Climate Change Act (CCA). The sample comprises 25 companies from a population of FTSE 100 companies during the period of 2004 - 2012. In corresponding to institutional legitimacy theory and strategic legitimacy theory, our analysis reveals the gradual improvement in disclosures over the period, which reflects in the achievement of peak disclosures after the enactment of EU ETS and CCA. Companies with carbon trading account are more responsive to these schemes than those without carbon trading account, while the <b>general</b> <b>disclosure</b> improvement rate is lower. Nevertheless, the quality of the disclosure remains low and stakeholders’ expectation of corporate carbon disclosure is still unmet, which justify further government intervention of mandating carbon reporting. These findings provide evidence of how corporate carbon disclosure evolves in a specific way to meet the expectation of various stakeholders and have important implications for the government and top management who are interested in improving corporate carbon disclosure practice and disclosure strategies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Most {{existing}} anonymization {{work has}} been done on static datasets, which have no update and need only onetime publication. Recent studies consider anonymizing dynamic datasets with external updates: the datasets are updated with record insertions and/or deletions. This paper addresses a new problem: anonymous re-publication of datasets with internal updates, where the attribute values of each record are dynamically updated. This is an important and challenging problem for attribute values of records are updating frequently in practice and existing methods are unable to deal with such a situation. We initiate a formal study of anonymous re-publication of dynamic datasets with internal updates, and show the invalidation of existing methods. We introduce theoretical definition and analysis of dynamic datasets, and present a <b>general</b> privacy <b>disclosure</b> framework that is applicable to all anonymous republication problems.

We consider a multiproduct oligopolistic market in which an incumbent firm that can disclose its cost-reducing know-how and several new entrants exist. Each firm supplies products in two separate markets. The incumbent firm has already allocated its production resources to one market (market A) and discloses its know-how concerning production in market A. We show that the disclosure of know-how for cost reduction can enhance the profit of the incumbent (the disclosing) firm. Using the disclosed know-how, the entrants can produce for a low cost in market A and allocate their production resources to the other market. As a result, competition in market A is less severe than {{that in the case}} in which the incumbent does not disclose its know-how. We also provide several extensions of the basic scenario...|$|R

Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. A high <b>general</b> HIV <b>disclosure</b> rate (94. 1 %; f= 320; N= 340) was observed of which 57. 5 % (f= 184; n= 320) was to sexual partners. X 2 procedures indicate an association with gender, residential region, religion, and period of being on ART. The majority (70. 2 %; f= 179; n= 255) of the respondents used condoms {{all the time to}} avoid infecting their sexual partners (99. 2 %; f= 243; n= 245) and to avoid contracting STIs (99. 2 %; f= 243; n= 245). X 2 procedures indicate an association with gender, residential region, marital status, number of sexual partners, knowledge of the HIV status of sexual partners and period of being on ART. The single leading reason for not using the condom was sexual partners’ refusal to use condoms (85. 7 %; f= 54; n= 63). Health StudiesM. A. (Health Studies...|$|R
