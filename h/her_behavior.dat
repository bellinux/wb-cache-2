5|$|During {{the early}} part of their trial she {{remained}} calm, complaining through her lawyers alleged disrespect for the flag while it was being produced as evidence. She loudly protested when the defense suggested that the group might have suffered from mental instability while committing the deed. On June 16, 1954, the jury found all four defendants guilty. On the morning of July 8, 1954, Lebrón learned of her son's death minutes before the sentence was to be announced.

Rover demanded the death penalty, but Holtzoff chose to sentence them to the longest terms of imprisonment possible. In Lebrón's case this was between sixteen and fifty years, depending on <b>her</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|E

By Spring 1915, Taliesin II was completed and Noel moved there with Wright. Wright's first wife Catherine finally granted him a divorce in 1922, meaning that Wright could marry Noel a year later. Although Wright admired Noel's erratic personality at first, <b>her</b> <b>behavior</b> (later identified as schizophrenia) led to a miserable life together at Taliesin.

50|$|Because of {{the decline}} in {{self-esteem}} amongst young girls, adulthood can be filled with doubts about one's self. This doubt leads to a different reaction to society and overall socialization as a young girl and as an adult.

Often, more than in earlier years, women decide to make changes to boost the self-esteem they always had the potential to obtain.|$|R

Her last full-length recording, the new-material live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0 (2002), sharply divided critics and sold poorly compared to her first album and work with the Fugees. Hill's subsequent activity, which includes the release of a few songs and occasional festival appearances, has been sporadic. <b>Her</b> <b>behavior</b> has sometimes caused audience dissatisfaction; a reunion with her former group did not last long. Her music, as well as a series of public statements she has issued, has become critical of pop culture and societal institutions. Hill has six children, five of whom are with Rohan Marley.

5|$|Ann Rule began {{corresponding}} with Green in 1996, {{and interviewed}} her in person in 1997. Rule recalls {{in her book}} on the case that Green's letters denied any unhappy childhood memories. Green claimed that though <b>her</b> <b>behavior</b> {{in the summer and}} fall of 1995 had been neglectful, she had neither the desire nor the wherewithal to set fire to her house or harm her children or her husband. Rule—who was neither a doctor nor a psychologist, but had a background in criminology and law enforcement—believed that even Green does not understand what caused her to attempt to murder Michael Farrar beyond {{the fact that she had}} come to hate him. Rule's theory was that in destroying Farrar, Green would have been able to preserve her own ego, in that Farrar would not have been able to leave her for another woman. Psychiatrist Michael H. Stone, using Rule's book as a source of information about Green, identifies Green as showing characteristics of psychopathy, borderline personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder.|$|E

Saori finds it difficult to associate with others; she has few friends, though becomes close to Shuichi. She tends to convey what is on her mind and disregards how others may take what she says. As Saori grows up, she gradually becomes more standoffish and stoic; she even has bad relations with her teachers. Despite her self-centered attitude, she remains popular among her male classmates due to her physical attractiveness. She is a sensitive girl whose temper sometimes gets the better of her when reprimanding bullies that tease Shuichi, because of Shuichi's femininity and cross-dressing. Saori is often emotionally affected by circumstances involving Shuichi, because of her feelings for Shuichi. Saori converts to Christianity partly because of this influence to seek forgiveness for her previous actions, though she only attends mass when feeling guilty about <b>her</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|E
5|$|That morning, {{the police}} interrogated Fischer's girlfriend Marianela at the sheriff's office. They {{asked her if}} she had ever had cross words with Cristina. She said she had never talked to her, though she was {{confused}} why they asked about his ex-girlfriend. Cisneros was also interrogated, but the police found nothing unusual about <b>her</b> <b>behavior,</b> only that she was nervous, and had left her car keys inside her vehicle. Later that day, Cristina went to Buddy's house and offered her condolences. The police did not treat the Cisneros' connection to Fischer any differently {{than the rest of the}} leads. They knew of Cisneros's calls, but they did not think it was suspicious enough to rule the murder a crime of passion. His stepfather initially thought that the murder was tied to a legal dispute over a contract worth thousands of dollars he had with a Chinese shrimp firm based in Arroyo City, Texas, just north of Brownsville that he had terminated. The police began to investigate this lead, and told Fischer's family that they were probably in danger. For about two weeks, they rarely left their house, and his parents considered sending Kathy and Eric to San Antonio, Texas, where their grandparents lived.|$|E

Hańska was closest {{to her brother}} Henryk, who later became famous {{for his work in}} the genre of Polish folk {{literature}} known as gawęda. They shared a passion for philosophical discussions, especially related to love and religion. Hańska's other brothers, Adam and Ernest, both pursued military careers. Hańska's eldest sister, Karolina, was admired as a child for her beauty, intellect, and musical talent. She later married a man 34 years her senior, a landowner from Podolie named Hieronim Sobański. They separated after two years, and she began a series of passionate affairs with some of her many suitors. These included the Russian general Ivan Ossipovitch Witt, the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, and the Russian writer Alexander Pushkin. The Tsar considered <b>her</b> <b>behavior</b> scandalous and declared her dangerously disloyal. As a result, Hańska and the other Rzewuski women were watched carefully by police when they visited the Russian capital of St Petersburg. Hańska's younger sisters, Alina and Paulina, married early into comfortable upper-class families. Alina married a wealthy landowner from Smilavichy, whose father had gained his fortune by managing property for the Ogiński family. Her nephew Stanisław Moniuszko became a renowned composer.
