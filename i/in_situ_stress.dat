The principles of NATM are fundamental to modern-day tunnelling, and NATM fundamentally involves specifically addressing the specific soil conditions being encountered. Most city tunnels are built at shallow depth and do not need to control the release of <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress</b> {{as was the case with}} the original NATM in the Alps. Projects in cities place a higher priority on minimizing settlement therefore they tend to use different support methods from the original NATM. This has led to a confusion in terminology in that tunnelling engineers use [...] "NATM" [...] to mean different things. New terms have arisen and alternative names for certain aspects of NATM have been adopted as its use has spread. This is partly caused by an increased use of this tunneling method in the United States, particularly in soft ground shallow tunnels.|$|E

Preferably these fractures should be longitudinal vertical fractures created from horizontal wells and conducting electricity from the heel to the toe of each heating well. For conductivity, an electrically-conductive material such as calcined petroleum coke is injected into the wells in fractures, forming a heating element. [...] Heating wells are placed in a parallel row with a second horizontal well intersecting them at their toe. This allows opposing electrical charges to be applied at either end. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that electrical continuity is unaffected by kerogen conversion and that hydrocarbons are expelled from heated oil shale even under <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress.</b> [...] Planar heaters should be used because they require fewer wells than wellbore heaters and offer a reduced surface footprint.

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{is widely}} used to determine <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress</b> of rock engineering. In this {{paper we propose a}} new method for simultaneously determining the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress</b> and elastic parameters of rock. The method utilizing the hydraulic fracturing numerical model and a computational intelligent method is proposed and verified. The hydraulic fracturing numerical model provides the samples which include borehole pressure, <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress,</b> and elastic parameters. A computational intelligent method is applied in back analysis. A multioutput support vector machine is used to map the complex, nonlinear relationship between the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress,</b> elastic parameters, and borehole pressure. The artificial bee colony algorithm is applied in back analysis to find the optimal <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress</b> and elastic parameters. The <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress</b> is determined using the proposed method and the results are compared with those of the classic breakdown formula. The proposed method provides a good estimate {{of the relationship between the}} <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress</b> and borehole pressure and predicts the maximum horizontal <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress</b> with high precision while considering the influence of pore pressure without the need to estimate Biot’s coefficient and other parameters...|$|E

30|$|Having {{information}} on the magnitude and direction of stress in high depth is of critical importance in geology and engineering sciences. Of uppermost applicants of stress data in oil industry, determination of borehole stability can be mentioned. To achieve scientific and engineering solutions for problems such as optimal mud weight, stable routes, casing, sand production, etc., precise {{information on}} stress position in depth is required. So, {{the present study is}} aimed to determine magnitude and directions of <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>in</b> a borehole located in south western Iran. Minimum horizontal stress is observed along the direction of borehole breakout and maximum horizontal one, along the direction of derived from drilling. Direction of these two horizontal stresses is determined by means of image log. Position of <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>in</b> the under-study field is of normal stress regime.

30|$|The {{estimation}} of the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stresses</b> is very crucial in {{oil and gas industry}} applications. Prior knowledge of the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stresses</b> is essential <b>in</b> the design of hydraulic fracturing operations in conventional and unconventional reservoirs. The fracture propagation and fracture mapping are strong functions of the values and directions of the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stresses.</b> Other applications such as drilling require the knowledge of the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stresses</b> to avoid the wellbore instability problems. The {{estimation of}} the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stresses</b> requires the knowledge of the Static Young’s modulus of the rock. Young’s modulus can be determined using expensive techniques by measuring the Young’s modulus on actual cores in the laboratory. The laboratory values are then used to correlate the dynamic values derived from the logs. Several correlations were introduced in the literature, but those correlations were very specific and when applied to different cases they gave very high errors and were limited to relating the dynamic Young’ modulus with the log data. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop an accurate and robust correlation for static Young’s modulus to be estimated directly from log data without the need for core measurements. Multiple regression analysis was performed on actual core and log data using 600 data points to develop the new correlations. The static Young’s modulus was found to be a strong function on three log parameters, namely compressional transit time, shear transit time, and bulk density. The new correlation was tested for different cases with different lithology such as calcite, dolomite, and sandstone. It gave good match to the measured data in the laboratory which indicates the accuracy and robustness of this correlation. In addition, it outperformed all correlations from the literature in predicting the static Young’s modulus. It will also help in saving time as well as cost because only the available log data are used in the prediction.|$|R

30|$|Stress {{redistribution}} {{will happen}} around the wellbore after the injection. The stress value {{is a function}} of in situ stresses, pressures, and temperatures. Maximum values of radial stress are in the direction of horizontal maximum <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress.</b> The values are important in wellbore failure because fracturing will happen in this direction. Maximum values of tangential stress are in the direction of horizontal minimum <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress.</b> Vertical stress around the wellbore is not related to horizontal maximum and minimum in situ stresses.

40|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is to develop a method to determine the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress</b> on an engineering scale by modifying the elasto-static thermal stress model (Sheorey’s model). The suggested method, firstly, introduces correction factors for the local tectonism to reflect the stress distribution difference caused by local tectonic movements. The correction factors can be determined by the least-squares approach based on laboratory tests and local <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress</b> measurements. Then, the rock elastic modulus is replaced by rock mass elastic modulus so as to show the effect of rock discontinuities on the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress.</b> Combining with elasticity theory, equations for estimating the major and minor horizontal stresses are obtained. It is possible to reach satisfactory accuracy for stress estimation. To show the feasibility of this method, it is applied to two deep tunnels in China to determine the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress.</b> Field tests, including <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress</b> measurements by conventional hydraulic fracturing (HF) and rock mass modulus measurements using a rigid borehole jack (RBJ), are carried out. It is shown that the stress field in the two deep tunnels is dominated by horizontal tectonic movements. The major and minor horizontal stresses are estimated, respectively. Finally, the results are compared with those derived from the HF method. The calculated results in the two tunnels roughly coincide with the measured results with an average of 15 % allowable discrepancy...|$|E
30|$|Vertical <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress</b> {{is usually}} {{assumed to be}} equal to {{the weight of the}} {{overlying}} layers per unit area and can be computed by integrating the bulk density log data. The direction of maximum or minimum horizontal <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress</b> can either be observed from image logs or caliper logs, or be estimated from basin-scale observation of geological events. The magnitude of minimum <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress</b> can be measured by leak-off tests (LOT) or hydraulic fracturing tests (Haimson and Fairhurst 1967; Haimson 1974). Small-scale hydraulic fracturing tests are called mini-frac tests. There are many types of mini-frac tests, such as Halliburton’s Diagnostic Fracture Injection Test (DFIT) and Schlumberger’s Modular Formation Dynamics Tester (MDT). However, there is no tool for direct measurement of maximum horizontal <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress.</b> The determination of maximum horizontal <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress</b> magnitude is often achieved by calculation from borehole breakouts, minimum horizontal stress, and rock mechanical properties such as cohesion, friction angle, and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) (Zoback et al. 1985; Peška and Zoback 1995). There are many other studies of <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress</b> determination. Ervin and Bell used breakdown pressure or leak-off pressure from formation leak-off tests to calculate the maximum horizontal stress estimation (Ervin and Bell 1987). Cornet and Valette (1984) developed a method based on normal stress measurements and fast flow rate reopening tests to calculate in situ stresses. Aadnoy (1990) developed a method to determine direction and magnitudes of horizontal in situ stresses based on the formation breakdown pressure of a circular borehole of arbitrary trajectory. The method has been successfully applied to a set of North Sea data. All the available methods for maximum horizontal stress calculation are based on a circular borehole shape. There are currently no reports found on the calculation of in situ stresses from elliptical boreholes.|$|E

Through comparison in vibration velocity, contour surface of rock mass excavation, and the crushing extent of excavated rock mass between calculation result and field monitoring, optimum linear charging density of blast hole is determined. Studies are also conducted on rock mass vibration in moderate or far distance to blasting source, the damage of surrounding rock in near-field to blasting source, and crushing degree of excavated rock mass under various <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress</b> conditions. Results indicate that, within certain range of <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress,</b> the blasting vibration is independent of <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress,</b> while when <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress</b> is increasing above certain value, the blasting vibration velocity will be increasing and the damage of surrounding rock and the crushing degree of excavated rock mass will be decreasing...|$|E

The purpose of SNL`s testing was to determine the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stress</b> using three different measurement techniques and, if possible, to estimate the rock mass modulus near the underground opening. The three stress-measuring techniques are (1) borehole deformation measurements using overcoring, (2) Anelastic Strain Recovery (ASR) complemented by laboratory ultrasonic and mechanical properties testing, and (3) the in situ flatjack technique using cancellation pressure. Rock mass modulus around the underground opening was estimated using the load deformation history of the flatjack and surrounding rock.

40|$|The {{variation}} of <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stresses</b> and geomechanical {{characteristics of a}} coalbed reservoir {{play an important role}} in determining {{variation of}} permeability, and hence, its overall gas production. In contrast to conventional reservoirs, CBM is released in a non-linear fashion with major part of adsorbed gas released as pressure decreases. It has been well established that strength of coal decreases with pressure depletion. It is hypothesized that the Young’s modulus (E) of coal, which is an important mechanical property indicative of its strength, is sensitive to pressure depletion. The basis of this study is to develop a correlation between variation of E and changes in effective horizontal stress. The relationship is established by utilizing the Shi and Durucan theoretical model for permeability. The results achieved by varying Young’s modulus show an improved modeling of <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>stresses</b> with gas depletion.
