PHP's MySQL-related extensions, such as the MySQLi extension, and the MySQL extension, are implemented using the PHP <b>extension</b> <b>framework.</b> An extension typically exposes an API to the PHP developer, to allow its facilities to be used programmatically.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{collected}} data increases exponentially and this exponential growth {{comes with a}} demand to analyze big volumes of data and to process the data fast and in real time. Business analysts have the expertise {{in the domain of}} the desired stream processing applications, but often lack the technical skills to create these kind of applications. Advanced software engineering skills are required in the development of these applications. This thesis aims to make real time stream processing available for the millions of spreadsheets users around the world. The thesis presents a novel spreadsheet model, that turns a spreadsheet into an effective integrated development environment for stream processing. The spreadsheet model is built upon the reactive <b>extensions</b> <b>framework,</b> a library for asynchronous programming with push based data streams. The spreadsheet model is implemented both as add-in for Microsoft Excel and as underlying part of a newly created spreadsheet application that was written in Scala.

These appliances collect and exchange the various kind of information (e. g., location, temperature) existing among them. We investigated a new way for describing such kind of information using the framework of CC/PP. We have applied HTTP <b>Extension</b> <b>Framework</b> to exchange their information. This combination will allow us to make web appliances useful without special extension of Web. We have developed two browsers, extended one existing server to ensure the interoperability, and demonstrated effectiveness of our framework.

40|$|Modern {{mobile phones}} contain {{extremely}} complex pieces of software and the software typically runs on {{different kind of}} devices. Devices may have varying hardware configurations and thus have different demands for software they contain. Mobile phone manufacturers also want to differentiate their products by enabling some advanced features in more expensive models. This poses interesting problems related to software variation management. Software has to be built from same source code for every device to keep development costs reasonable. Therefore methods to support flexible software variation have to be developed. In this thesis an <b>extension</b> <b>framework</b> is designed for Symbian operating system applications. The <b>extension</b> <b>framework</b> lets software developers separate features to separate extension components that can be delivered {{in addition to the}} core applications. The extension components add features dynamically to the core application and they can be left out from the device to make more restricted versions of the same application...|$|E
40|$|CVS (Concurrent Versions System) {{is widely}} used in various {{software}} development projects. The reason {{is that it is}} simple to deploy and use, and little regulates the process of configuration management (CM), unlike rich featured CM systems. As a consequence developers need to perform the CM process of their project by hand. We propose an extensible proxy server for CVS. It allows developers to add their own extensions supporting their process without any modification to CVS. We use object-oriented application frameworks to realize this extensibility. The architecture of the proxy consists of one library layer and two framework layers: the CVS adapter, the basic system framework, and extension frameworks. The basic system framework provides primitive and wide extensibility, and each <b>extension</b> <b>framework</b> provides domain-specific extensibility. Developers can implement extensions with low programming cost with appropriate use of each layer We present an <b>extension</b> <b>framework</b> for access control mechanisms, and two access control mechanisms as the examples of extensions. リサーチレポート（北陸先端科学技術大学院大学情報科学研究科...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an out-of-sample <b>extension</b> <b>framework</b> for {{a global}} {{manifold}} learning algorithm (Isomap) that uses temporal information in out-of-sample points {{in order to make}} the embedding more robust to noise and artifacts. Given a set of noise-free training data and its embedding, the proposed framework extends the embedding for a noisy time series. This is achieved by adding a spatio-temporal compactness term to the optimization objective of the embedding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method for out-of-sample extension of manifold embeddings that leverages timing information available for the extension set. Experimental results demonstrate that our out-of-sample extension algorithm renders a more robust and accurate embedding of sequentially ordered image data in the presence of various noise and artifacts when compared to other timing-aware embeddings. Additionally, we show that an out-of-sample <b>extension</b> <b>framework</b> based on the proposed algorithm outperforms the state of the art in eye-gaze estimation...|$|E
