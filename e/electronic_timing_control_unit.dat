The Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) based sensor employs a multi-reset {{integration}} scheme enabling sequential acquisition of high resolution (8 -bit) light intensity while using {{only a single}} pixel memory. The proposed multi-reset integration method reduces the memory requirements at the pixel-level, without impacting the pixel encoding resolution, as only one bit memory per pixel is required compared to the eight bits memory in conventional pixel architecture. As a consequence, both the pixel size and the fill factor are significantly improved. A near-optimal <b>timing</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> coupled with a linearization circuit is proposed in order to limit the timing penalty incurred by the proposed integration method enabling to maintain high frame rates. A 64 x 64 sensor array was fabricated using AMS 0. 35 mu m CMOS technology. A pixel size of 23 mu m x 21 mu m with a fill factor of 23 % is achieved, resulting in over 75 % reduction in terms of pixel size and doubling the pixel fill-factor as compared to a conventional 8 -bit DPS. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme while achieving a dynamic range higher than 100 dB as well as good linearity of the Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) response...|$|R

40|$|CMOS image sensors {{are widely}} used in many {{electronic}} devices such as smart phone and digital camera because of their easy integration with standard CMOS process. Recently, the aggressive technology scaling of CMOS process has {{open the door to}} the implementation of pixel-level analog to digital data conversion, leading to the digital pixel sensor (DPS). Although DPS features advantages such as wide dynamic range and immunity to technology scaling, conventional DPS still has two major problems waiting to be solved. Firstly, the power consumption is still relatively large since each pixel includes an analog comparator consuming static power. Secondly, large pixel size is another issue of digital pixel sensor due to a typical 8 bits pixel-level memory for data storage. This thesis proposes two solutions to solve these two problems. A low power CMOS image sensor using DPS scheme is proposed. A sub-threshold <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> is used in order to enable or disable the pixel-level ADC depending on the photodiode sensing voltage, hence enabling to save the static power needed to operate the pixel-level ADC. Results show that up to 90 % power saving is achieved when compared with the conventional digital pixel sensor. In addition, a compact digital pixel sensor employing time to spike analog to digital conversion is presented. Different from conventional digital pixel sensor using 8 bit in-pixel memory, the proposed scheme efficiently utilizes the characteristics of timing information provided by the <b>timing</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> and partitions the data write operation into 8 phases such that 7 bit in-pixel memory can be moved out of pixel featuring 87. 5 % saving of the in-pixel memory. The conditional refreshment scheme is employed to avoid proportionally increasing the exposure time while increasing the resolution enabling better speed performance for high resolution applications. The dual sampling memory is designed to flexibly accommodate different encoding schemes. Results show that up to 75 % pixel area saving is achieved compared with the conventional digital pixel sensor. Additionally, analysis and simulation results show that the dynamic range can be extended to be larger than 100 dB. The proposed technique achieves 23 μm × 21 μm pixel size with a 23 % fill factor in a 0. 35 μm CMOS process...|$|R
40|$|CMOS RF {{transceivers}} for wireless sensor {{networks for}} two discriminative sensor network applications are presented; one is an energy-constraint WSN, requiring low-power and self-contained operation powered by a piezoelectric energy harvester. The other is a high-throughput WSN, requiring a real-time, high-precision, and high-data- rate operation with improved multi-node capacity using collaborative OFDMA. ^ The target application of the energy-constraint WSN is a condition monitoring on mechanical structures. The WSN is self contained with the power generated by the piezoelectric energy harvester producing about 100 μW. The corresponding sensor network utilizes an asynchronous beacon-detection based duty cycle control architecture to reduce power consumption and support ID-based TDMA while avoiding the need for timing synchronization between nodes. It also provides FDMA and fixed time slot TDMA for further network flexibility. The sensor node transceiver includes a duty-cycle <b>timing</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> to minimize power consumption; an LO-less, TDMA-capable, addressable beacon receiver; an FDMA-capable transmitter; and a low power, universal sensor interface. The proposed sensor node, implemented in 0. 13 -μm CMOS technology, achieves low power consumption and {{a high degree of}} flexibility without calibration or the use of BAW or SAW filters. The sensor node is experimentally demonstrated to operate autonomously from the power provided by a piezoelectric vibration energy harvester with dimensions of 27 × 23 × 6. 5 mm 3 excited by 4. 5 -m/s 2 acceleration at 40. 8 Hz. The WSN condition monitoring behavior is measured with a capacitive temperature sensor, and achieves an effective temperature resolution of 0. 36 °C. ^ The high-throughput WSN is utilized for a real-time spatial pressure sensing application with the improved spectrum efficiency using collaborative OFDMA. The WSN achieves a small size by replacing bulky batteries and crystals with wireless powering and clocking techniques. The wireless clocking also enables the symbol synchronization between different nodes required for collaborative OFDMA which improves spectrum efficiency by twice over FDMA. The sensor nodes are fabricated in 0. 13 -μm CMOS technology, and each node consumes 43. 8 mW. The nodes uses a piezoelectric pressure sensor to detect the pressure data. The ADC 2 ̆ 7 s resolution is 8 bit, and the temporal resolution is 2 Msps, implementing 16 -Mbps data rate per node, with 4 Msps symbol rate for 16 -QAM symbols. An integer-N PLL is used to achieve channel spacing with 4 MHz frequency step between adjacent channels. Five sensor nodes in adjacent channels are tested to verify the collaborative OFDMA operation.

40|$|Embedded SRAM {{memory is}} a vital {{component}} in modern SoCs. More than 80 % of the System-on-Chip (SoC) die area is often occupied by SRAM arrays. As such, system reliability and yield is largely governed by the SRAM's performance and robustness. The aggressive scaling trend in CMOS device minimum feature size, coupled with the growing demand in high-capacity memory integration, has imposed the use of minimal size devices to realize a memory bitcell. The smallest 6 T SRAM bitcell to date occupies a 0. 1 um 2 in silicon area. SRAM bitcells continue to benefit from an aggressive scaling trend in CMOS technologies. Unfortunately, other system components, such as interconnects, experience a slower scaling trend. This has resulted in dramatic deterioration in a cell's ability to drive a heavily-loaded interconnects. Moreover, the growing fluctuation in device properties due to Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) variations has added more uncertainty to SRAM operation. Thus ensuring {{the ability of a}} miniaturized cell to drive heavily-loaded bitlines and to generate adequate voltage swing is becoming challenging. A large percentage of state-of-the-art SoC system failures are attributed to the inability of SRAM cells to generate the targeted bitline voltage swing within a given access time. The use of read-assist mechanisms and current mode sense amplifiers are the two key strategies used to surmount bitline loading effects. On the other hand, new bitcell topologies and cell supply voltage management are used to overcome fluctuations in device properties. In this research we tackled conventional 6 T SRAM bitcell limited drivability by introducing new integrated voltage sensing schemes and current-mode sense amplifiers. The proposed schemes feature a read-assist mechanism. The proposed schemes' functionality and superiority over existing schemes are verified using transient and statistical SPICE simulations. Post-layout extracted views of the devices are used for realistic simulation results. Low-voltage operated SRAM reliability and yield enhancement is investigated and a wordline boost technique is proposed as a means to manage the cell's WL operating voltage. The proposed wordline driver design shows a significant improvement in reliability and yield in a 400 -mV 6 T SRAM cell. The proposed wordline driver design exploit the cell's Dynamic Noise Margin (DNM), therefore boost peak level and boost decay rate programmability features are added. SPICE transient and statistical simulations are used to verify the proposed design's functionality. Finally, at a bitcell-level, we proposed a new five-transistor (5 T) SRAM bitcell which shows competitive performance and reliability figures of merit compared to the conventional 6 T bitcell. The functionality of the proposed cell is verified by post-layout SPICE simulations. The proposed bitcell topology is designed, implemented and fabricated in a standard ST CMOS 65 nm technology process.
