This necessitates the study of their long-term behavior. It is desirable to study the long-term performance of the <b>insulators</b> in the service environment under multistress conditions encountered by the <b>insulators</b> to better simulate the actual conditions. This paper {{presents the results of}} the studies of a novel, third generation, environmental friendly thermoplastic elastomeric (TPE) <b>insulators</b> and conventional thermoset silicone rubber (SiR) <b>insulators</b> in Connecticut, USA and Taxila, Pakistan. 28 and 10 kV <b>insulators</b> were used for this purpose. The aging phenomena were characterized by visual observations, hydrophobicity classification and using sophisticated materials analysis techniques, such as FTIR.

This type of pylon {{was used for the}} first 735kV power line from the Manic-Outardes power stations to the load centre of Montreal. There are two significant variations of the delta pylon; one has longer side crossbars such that all three bundles of conductors are suspended on V-shaped insulators. The other has shorter side crossbars, such that the two outside bundles are hung on a vertical <b>insulator</b> string and only the middle bundle is hung with a V-shaped <b>insulator.</b>|$|E

5|$|Heavy metals {{or their}} {{compounds}} {{can be found}} in electronic components, electrodes, and wiring and solar panels where they may be used as either conductors, semiconductors, or insulators. Molybdenum powder is used in circuit board inks. Ruthenium(IV) oxide coated titanium anodes are used for the industrial production of chlorine. Home electrical systems, for the most part, are wired with copper wire for its good conducting properties. Silver and gold are used in electrical and electronic devices, particularly in contact switches, {{as a result of their}} high electrical conductivity and capacity to resist or minimise the formation of impurities on their surfaces. The semiconductors cadmium telluride and gallium arsenide are used to make solar panels. Hafnium oxide, an <b>insulator,</b> is used as a voltage controller in microchips; tantalum oxide, another <b>insulator,</b> is used in capacitors in mobile phones. Heavy metals have been used in batteries for over 200 years, at least since Volta invented his copper and silver voltaic pile in 1800.

Till now, various electrical tests have been performed on polymeric <b>insulators</b> to investigate their performance in different situations and to provide a solution for predicting their effective lifetime. Also some standards for testing polymeric <b>insulators</b> have been proposed e. g. IEC 62217. In this paper, three pairs of similar 63 kV and three pairs of similar 132 kV polymeric <b>insulators</b> have been selected for studying the relation between leakage current of polymeric <b>insulators</b> and their specific creepage distance based on IEC 62217 standard. The specimens have been tested in three different creepage distances which are proportion of overall creepage distance. The Fast Fourier Transform analysis has been used to find the harmonic spectrum of the leakage current.

This type of tower features two guyed-tower legs similar to the V-guyed tower, but the two legs don't converge at the tower base. In the case of the cross-rope suspension tower, the tower legs are spread apart on two different foundations. In addition, the crossbar is replaced by a series of suspension cables with three vertical <b>insulator</b> strings to support the three bundles, which allows this design to consume only 6.3 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line.

However, due to the short application history and experience, the degradation of composite <b>insulators</b> in natural environment is a big concern for the power utilities. The knowledge {{on the degradation of}} composite <b>insulators</b> is being studied world wide. The methods to assess the working conditions of composite <b>insulators</b> are being studied and created. In Queensland University of Technology (QUT), the approach based on chemical analysis methods was first developed. The work in this thesis based on the previous research work is focused on correlating electrical characteristics with chemical analysis results of the composite <b>insulators</b> and physical observations results. First,the electrical characteristics of composite <b>insulators</b> were presented and analysed, including leakage current, cumulative current, peaks of leakage current, the statistic results of the leakage current.

The shape of waveforms was found to relate to the degree of discharge activities of the composite <b>insulators.</b> The waveforms analysed by FFT revealed that the odd harmonic components became obvious during the discharge activities. The correlations between the electrical characteristics of composite <b>insulators</b> and chemical analysis results showed that the composition of composite <b>insulators</b> plays significant roles in terms of electrical performance.

5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an <b>insulator.</b> Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are free to move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E

While of no use in a bomb, it was urgently required for experiments with enriched uranium. The last shipment of Alpha product was made on 11 May 1944.
