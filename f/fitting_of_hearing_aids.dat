40|$|SummaryA good audiologic {{diagnosis}} is increasingly {{more important in}} the practice of audiology, in order to understand patients’ needs for selection and fitting of hearing aid devices. AimShow recent literature that mention the concept of cochlear dead regions, diagnostic strategies and its relevance in the process of selection and <b>fitting</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aids.</b> Methodsto carry out a bibliographical survey on dead cochlear regions. Dead cochlear regions were described as regions where inner hair cells and/or adjacent neurons do not work. Therefore, in these regions, the information generated by basilar membrane vibration is not transmitted to the central nervous system. However, a tone at a frequency correspondent to that of dead regions, provided it being sufficiently intense, can be perceived in regions near this zone where inner hair cells and/or nervous fibers still work. ConclusionThe identification of dead regions in the cochlea is used to obtain better results in the process of selection and <b>fitting</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> because the pieces of information generated by inner hair cells to the auditory nerve are important to better identify sounds, mainly those related to speech...|$|E

40|$|A signal {{processing}} system {{was designed to}} simulate hearing impairment for normal hearing listeners. Typical consequences of sensorineural hearing loss are an elevated threshold in quiet, abnormal growth of loudness ('recruitment') and reduced spectral and temporal resolution.

Based on an aurally adequate time-frequency representation, these effects can be simulated by intensity quantization and frequency dependent dynamic level expansion. The Fourier Time Transformation (FTT) was used for analysis of the time signal and the inverse FTT for resynthesis of the modified complex spectra.

The ability to perceive binaural cues is also strongly related to understanding a target speaker in a noisy environment.

30|$|CWU {{surgery is}} {{preferred}} in children because it obviates the potential requirement for lifelong ear care, improves the <b>fitting</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> when required, and {{is less likely}} to lead to otorrhoea associated with swimming [3]. Cholesteatoma in children, however, is more aggressive than adult disease and has a higher rate of recurrent and residual disease post-operatively [43] and the otologist is more inclined to perform mandatory second-look surgery to detect disease. Having said this, a recent large prospective observational study comparing 154 adult cases with 54 paediatric cases in detecting post-operative disease, showed similar good diagnostic performance between the two groups [38]. Hence, clinically, DWI can be considered effective in a paediatric setting as in an adult setting, in which many otologists will have more experience. By avoiding radiation exposure and administration of intravenous contrast medium, DWI is especially attractive for imaging children.

A preliminary validation by probe tube measurements in 20 ears shows that the accuracy of the predictions is close to what could be obtained with closed fittings, with a few excaptions that will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander {{children}} {{suffer from}} a high prevalence <b>of</b> conductive <b>hearing</b> loss associated with otitis media and hearing health services {{have been developed to}} provide assessment and treatment for indigenous children. Provision of appropriate amplification to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children with hearing loss {{is an integral part of}} such services. The present study was designed to provide qualitative information regarding the Australian Hearing Services amplification programme as it related to rural indigenous children in Queensland. Children fitted with amplification devices and living on three Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities were studied to provide qualitative information concerning possible factors which may contribute to the successful use <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> and other devices. The factors considered by respondents to contribute to successful <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> use in indigenous rural communities included the age of the child at the time <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> <b>fitting,</b> acceptance <b>of</b> the <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> by the child, teacher and family, consistency <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> use, perception <b>of</b> benefit by the child and significant others, teacher motivation and support, family motivation and support, communication between the schools, communities and service providers, regular school attendance, and the design and reliability of devices. The degree or type <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> loss and management of the device were not considered to be contributing factors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|All {{researches}} {{point to}} the fact that the early de­tection and diagnosis are still performed late (after the third year of life), so in the first three years of life there is no establishment of the developmental changes in a way that they include the interrelation aspects of the human development and its natural sequences. With the start of early rehabilitation procedures we encourage the positive manner of communication in the small deaf child, so that it manufactures and processes information that can lead to positive quality changes in the develop­mental process. The hearing technology has dramatically changed over the last decades. With the contribution of audiometers in the 40 -ties of the last century we started to learn how to precisely estimate the de­gree and type <b>of</b> the <b>hearing</b> impairment, which has an enormous meaning for the optimal <b>fitting</b> <b>of</b> the powerful <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> and the cochlear im­plants. In the same period <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> for small children are developed which enabled children with a sig­nificant hearing loss a better opportunity to de­velop speech and their spoken language...|$|R
40|$|Bilateral <b>fittings</b> <b>of</b> bone-anchored <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> (BAHA) were {{evaluated}} in 25 patients {{with at least}} 3 months experience with using two BAHAs. For all patients, air conduction <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> were contraindicated due to either recurrent otorrhoea or otitis externa (19 cases) or to congenital aural atresia (six cases). Candidacy for bilateral fitting was primarily based on symmetry of bone conduction thresholds. For all patients, measurements comprised sound localisation, speech recognition in quiet and in noise. In addition, in a subgroup of nine patients, release from masking for pure-tone stimuli in noise with interaural phase differences (binaural masking level difference. BMLD) was measured. The percentage of correct localisation judgments with 500 -Hz and 2 -kHz noise bursts increased significantly (p 0. 05) for unilateral and bilateral fittings when the noise {{was presented at the}} contralateral side of the first fitted BAHA. The results for the six patients with congenital atresia are comparable with those for the other patients. So, directional hearing and speech recognition in noise improve significantly with a second BAHA. The BMLD measurements showed a significant (p< 0. 01) release from masking of 6. 1, 6. 0 and 6. 6 dB for 125 -Hz, 250 -Hz and 500 -Hz stimuli, respectively. The BMLD effect of 4. 1 dB at 1, 000 Hz was not significant at the 5 per cent level. The positive results with the bilateral fittings in quiet can be ascribed to increased stimulus levels due to diotic summation of signals from either side. The results for localisation, speech recognition in noise and BMLD measurements indicate that bilaterally fitted BAHAs do indeed (to some extent) result in binaural hearing...|$|R
