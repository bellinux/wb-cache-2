An asymmetrical mechanical phenomenon between tensile and compressive process is found, and the yield stress and flow stress in compression {{are higher than}} those in tension simulations. The compressive deformation process {{can be described as}} three characteristic regions: quasi-elastic deformation, plastic flowing deformation, and strain strengthening. During the plastic flowing deformation region, the material shows very good compressive <b>ductibility.</b> The plastic deformation is mainly dominated by the grain boundary atom slide...|$|E
40|$|Metallic {{materials}} including stainless steel, titanium alloys, and cobalt-based alloys constitute, due {{to their}} high strength, <b>ductibility,</b> and good corrosion resistance, an important class of materials in hard tissue replacement, especially load-bearing implants for the repair or replacement of diseased or damaged bones tissues. But, these metallic materials are not biodegradable in the human body, so a second surgical intervention may be necessary after the tissues have healed. Thus a strong body of research focuses on new biodegradable implants, which dissolves in biological environment after a certain time of functional use. Biodegradable implants constitute an appropriate solution because of cost...|$|E

Prisms were confined by high-tensile steel bolts inserted horizontally in two orthogonal directions through pre-formed ducts, and the annular space between ducts and bolts was grouted with high strength epoxy resin. Significant enhancement of the strength and <b>ductibility</b> of the concrete was obtained. Specimens displayed large energy absorption and dissipation capacity under cyclic loading.

40|$|Kidney stone {{patients}} {{often have}} a decrease in BMD. It is unclear if reduced BMD {{is caused by a}} primary disorder of bone or dietary factors. To study the independent effects of hypercalciuria on bone, we used genetic hypercalciuric stone-forming (GHS) rats. GHS and control (Ctl) rats were fed a low Ca (0. 02 % Ca, LCD) or a high Ca (1. 2 % Ca, HCD) diet for 6 wk in metabolic cages. All comparisons are to Ctl rats. Urine Ca was greater in the GHS rats on both diets. GHS fed HCD had reduced cortical (humerus) and trabecular (L 1 –L 5 vertebrae) BMD, whereas GHS rats fed LCD had a reduction in BMD similar to Ctl. GHS rats fed HCD had a decrease in trabecular volume and thickness, whereas LCD led to a ∼ 20 -fold increase in both osteoid surface and volume. GHS rats fed HCD had no change in vertebral strength (failure stress), <b>ductibility</b> (failure strain), stiffness (modulus), or toughness, whereas in the humerus, there was reduced <b>ductibility</b> and toughness and an increase in modulus, indicating that the defect in mechanical properties is mainly manifested in cortical, rather than trabecular, bone. GHS rat cortical bone is more mineralized than trabecular bone and LCD led to a decrease in the mineralization profile. Thus, the GHS rats, fed an ample Ca diet, have reduced BMD with reduced trabecular volume, mineralized volume, and thickness, and their bones are more brittle and fracture prone, indicating that GHS rats have an intrinsic disorder of bone that is not secondary to diet...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Inert gas {{atomized}} (IGA) superalloy Inconel 625 powder was consolidated by hot {{isostatic pressing}} (HIPing) directly under the HIPing parameters of 1100 ℃/ 110 MPa/ 3 h. The structure and properties of the as–HIPed samples were investigated using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and tensile tests at room temperature, and its relative density was measured by drainage. The fracture surface morphology of the tensile specimens have been investigated using SEM. The results showed that full density alloy can be obtained under the HIPing parameters of 1100 ℃/ 110 MPa/ 3 h. Due {{to the effect of}} prior particle boundaries (PPBs), the strength of the as-HIPed alloy is comparatively high, but its <b>ductibility</b> is comparatively low...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Split Hopkinson {{pressure}} bar (SHPB) and one-stage light gas gun are utilized {{to study the}} dynamic mechanical properties of reinforced concrete (RC) subjected to shock loading. The former experimental {{results show that the}} strength and stiffness of RC decrease but the <b>ductibility</b> increases with increasing the volume fractions of reinforced fibers due to more damage in the concrete and interface. For the latter experiment, three stress-time curves are recorded by three manganin pressure transducers embedded in the targets. With the stress-time records, complete histories of particle velocity and strain etc. can be obtained at any point within the gauged regions of RC using the path line principle of Lagrangian analysis method. The stress-strain curves of RC present stagnant-return properties. And some other dynamic properties can be gained, such as strain rate hardening, wave shape dispersion effects and the rheological properties of the concrete. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: For {{the purpose}} of {{studying}} the difference of mixing and cocrystallization of TNT(2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene) and CL- 20 (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 -hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane), molecular dynamics simulation(MD) was performed within Discover code. After the equilibrium of the system, the average bond length of trigger bond(Lave) is almost unchanged after mixing or cocrystallization. However, the largest bond length of trigger bond(Lmax) of CL- 20 in cocrystal is shorter than that of it in pure CL- 20, indicting the cocrystal {{is more difficult to}} be detonated than CL- 20. The Lmax of TNT shows the same result. The cocrystal shows a larger cohesive energy density than composite ones, suggesting the cocrystal is more insensitive. Besides, trigger bond energy of cocrystal is larger than physical mixture of TNT and CL- 20, suggesting the cocrystal is more insensitive. The mechanical properties show the cocrystal is more harder than pure TNT or CL- 20, but has a weaker <b>ductibility</b> and tenacity...|$|E
40|$|Equal channel angular {{pressing}} {{provides a}} convenient approach to introduce ultrafine grain size into commonly used metallic materials. In this study, equal channel angular pressing of (TiB+TiC) /TC 18 composite {{was carried out}} under different passes via route Bc. Microstructure evolution is systematically investigated by optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The results show that grain boundary sliding contributes much to the plastic deformation and grains are refined largely to 100 nm for (TiB+TiC) /TC 18 with 0. 2 % B 4 C addition after two passes. The appearance of dislocation accelerates the transformation of spherical α recrystallized grains. Sufficient recrystallization is obtained after three passes. Tensile tests show that both high strength and elongation appear in the specimen with 0. 2 wt% B 4 C addition, which is deformed repeatedly after three passes. Equal channel angular pressing thus be a viable mode for producing titanium matrix composite with both high strength and <b>ductibility...</b>|$|E
40|$|Reinforcement of Portland cement-based binders {{with natural}} {{wollastonite}} microfibres has been further investigated {{with emphasis on}} the effect of fibre geometry on property modification. Wollastonite microfibres were separated into five different size groups before addition to cement and cement-silica fume matrices. The aspect ratio (length/ width) of the wollastonite microfibres was determined by scanning electron microscopy technique. Systematic experimentation including flexural tests, mercury intrusion, porosimetry, helium gas pycnometry, and isopropyl alcohol saturation measurement showed that, at constant microfibre content, the flexural strength and total porsity of the composites remained essentially unchanged and independent of the aspect ratio of the wollastonite microfibres. However, the volume of coarse pores, the pore size distribution, the flexural toughness and overall <b>ductibility</b> characteristics of the hydrated cement and cement-silica fume matrices were observed to change systematically as the aspect ratio of wollastonite micro-fibres was increased. A discussion of the differences in the observed properties is presented. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Polymermaterials {{have been}} {{considered}} as promising candidates {{for the implementation of}} memristor devices due to their low-cost, easy solution processability, mechanical flexibility and <b>ductibility,</b> tunable electronic performance through innovative molecular design cum synthesis strategy and compatibility with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology as well. The digital-type polymer memristor behaves as resistive random access memory with non-volatility, high density, more speed, low power consumption, large ON/OFF ratio, high endurance and long retention, and is recognized as an appealing candidate for the next generation "universal memory". As a logic component, the analog-type memristor, with the ability to emulate the fundamental synaptic functions of short-term/long-term plasticity (STP/LTP), spike-timing dependent-plasticity (STDP), spike-rate dependent plasticity (SRDP) and "learningexperience" behaviors, can be used to construct artificial neural networks for neuromorphic computation.

40|$|AbstractCocrystallization is a {{promising}} technique {{for the design}} and preparation of new explosives, and the stability of cocrystal is highly concerned by the researchers. In {{order to make a}} better understanding of the behavior of cocrystal under the extreme conditions, DFT (density functional theory) calculation is performed to investigate the effect of hydrostatic pressure on geometrical and electronic structures of the cocrystal BTF (benzotrifuroxan) /TNA (2, 4, 6 -trinitroaniline). When the hydrostatic pressure is applied, the lattice constants, volume, density and total energy change gradually except at the pressures of 40  GPa and 79 – 83  GPa. It is noteworthy that new chemical bonds form when the pressure is up to 83  GPa. The band gap of the cocrystal becomes smaller when the pressure is applied, and finally the cocrystal shows a characteristic of metal. The mechanical property of cocrystal is calculated by MD (molecular dynamics) simulation. The results show that the cocrystal has a better <b>ductibility</b> at low temperature, and has the best tenacity at 295  K...|$|E
40|$|Electron {{beam and}} laser beam {{processes}} with average power in kW area up to mys zone are increasingly {{used in the}} metalworking industry to divide the viscosity function of the basic material from the tribological function of the surface. The abrasion properties of moved parts for example can bei considerably improved while simultaneous mass reduction takes place. The high durability reduces material consumption and the improved friction properties reduce the energy demand. Due to control of power density distribution and due to variation of interaction times during refining and due to transformation of material parameters during prodution, temperature distribution, which must be defined in time and place can be achieved in metal. The high power densities with high heating and colling rates as well as steep temperature gradients, the slight thermic load of the material outside the processing area and the great variety of processing patterns with exact delimittion of the beam shaping and the beam guiding distinguish electron beam processes from conventional ones. This opens up new or improved industrial applications for certain structure changes of the material with the required surface properties such as abrasion, corrosion, solidity and <b>ductibility...</b>|$|E

HRB 400 {{reinforcing}} steel {{due to high}} strength and high <b>ductibility</b> is as the main {{reinforcing steel}} in “Code for design of concrete structures (GB 50010 - 2002) ” in China. Cyclic potentiodynamic polarization technique was used to investigate the electrochemical corrosion bebavior of HRB 400 reinforcing steel in Simulated Concrete Pore solutions (SCP solutions) differently contaminated by bicarbonate ions and/or chloride ions. The evolution feature of the corrosion parameters was analyzed and was {{compared with that of}} HPB 235 reinforcing steel. The results show that the corrosion characteristics of HRB 400 and HPB 235 were exceedingly similar before the destruction of the passivation film. However, HRB 400 is remarkedly more susceptible to chloride ions and carbonation than HPB 235 during the failure of the passivation films. The pH threshold for HRB 400 is larger than that for HPB 235, and the chlorides threshold for the former is smaller than that of the latter. When HRB 400 and HPB 235 were connected and exposed to an aggressive environment, the galvanic corrosion will occur where HRB 400 is anode and HPB 235 is cathode. To ensure the durability of the reinforcing concrete structures, it is necessary to make the connection points insulate...|$|E

A numerical study was carried out to simulate MSP creep tests by using the finite element software MARC. The creep stress exponent adopted in the numerical simulation was compared with the evaluation result. It is found that differences are 1. 6 % and 2. 7 % for 12 Cr 1 MoV steel and tungsten-alloyed 9 % Cr steel, respectively. The difference between the MSP creep test result of SUS 304 stainless steel and the traditionally uniaxial creep test result is only 2. 9 %. The validity of the theory formula is verified by the consistency of numerical simulation results and by the excellent agreement with the experimental results.

40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, an {{experimental}} dental arch model fabricated in epoxy was assayed in Kratos {{universal testing machine}} to study the mechanical behavior of ethylene and vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) {{in the form of}} mouthguard for sports and flat plate. The following variables were considered: thickness (3 and 4 -mm plates), temperature (room and mouth temperature) and presence/absence of artificial saliva. Mechanical properties of EVA were tested under compressive strength: apparent absorbed energy (J. mm- 1), maximum tension (N. mm- 1), maximum dislocation (mm) and maximum strength (N). Data were recorded and modeled mathematically. Regarding the absorbed energy, maximum tension and maximum force, it was verified that the higher the thickness of the mouthguards, the better the results of force dissipation and redirection to the system and to several regions of the dental arch. In the presence of saliva and close to mouth temperature, the material responded positively to these alterations, resenting increased <b>ductibility</b> as well as improved mechanical responses. Regarding maximum dislocation, it was observed a better accommodation of the occlusion under conditions that simulate those observed in the oral environment. In conclusion, EVA proved to be an adequate material for fabrication of mouthguards and interocclusal splints. In addition, EVA showed good results in force dissipation and demonstrated a shock-absorbing capacity and a great protection potential...|$|E

The main focus of this work is the orientation-dependent effects on the mechanical properties. The common neighbor analysis method is used to investigate the structural evolution and deformation mechanism of Au nanowires. The simulation {{results show that the}} Young's modulus is strongly dependent on nanowire's orientation. Under tension, all the oriented nanowires yield via the activities of Shockley partial dislocations, and their plastic deformation is accommodated by partial dislocation activities without twining. Under compression, the [1 0 0] nano-wire presents the same yield mechanism together with the deformation twins occurring in its plastic deformation, however, for the [1 1 0] and [1 1 1] nanowires, the buckling instability preferentially occurs, followed by full dislocation activities to carry the plastic deformation without partial dislocations involved. The deformation behaviors indicate that the predication of the Schmidt factor based on bulk single crystal is valid for Au nanowires under compression but not under tension. Our study also shows that the [1 1 0] Au nanowire exhibits a better <b>ductibility,</b> while the [1 1 1] Au nanowire possesses excellent overall mechanical properties. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.
