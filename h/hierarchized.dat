Although Hierarchical MIPv 6 (HMIPv 6) {{has been designed}} to enhance the performance of MIPv 6 by <b>hierarchizing</b> the network, it does not always outperform MIPv 6. In fact, two solutions have different application scopes. Existing work studies the impact of various parameters on the performance of MIPv 6 and HMIPv 6, but without analyzing their application scopes. In this paper, we propose a model to analyze the application scopes of MIPv 6 and HMIPv 6, through which an Optimal Choice of Mobility Management (OCMM) scheme is designed. Different from the existing work that either propose new mobility management schemes or enhance existing mobility management schemes, OCMM chooses the better alternative between MIPv 6 and HMIPv 6 according to the mobility and service characteristics of users, addressing whether to <b>hierarchize</b> the network. Besides that, OCMM chooses the best mobility anchor point and regional size when HMIPv 6 is adopted, addressing how to <b>hierarchize</b> the network. Simulation results demonstrate the impact of key parameters on the application scopes of MIPv 6 and HMIPv 6 as well as the optimal regional size of HMIPv 6. Finally, we show that OCMM outperforms MIPv 6 and HMIPv 6 in terms of total cost including average registration and packet delivery costs. Index Terms—Mobile IPv 6, hierarchical mobile IPv 6, application scope, regional size. ...|$|R

All too often {{it was a way}} of putting material culture into categories in such a way that marginalized and <b>hierarchized</b> the cultures that they came out of. During the “golden age” of museum going, material culture were used to show the supposed evolution of society: you go from the simple objects of non-westerns to the advanced objects of Europeans. It was a way of showing that Europeans were at the end of the evolution of society, while non-westerners were at the beginning. Eventually, scholars got away from the notion that culture evolved though predictable cycles, and the study of material culture changed to have a more objective view of non-western material culture.|$|E

In the mid-Preclassical (800 BC), several villages developed in this place, which slowly evolved and grew, becoming cities and eventually became major civic-ceremonial urban centers in the late-preclassical (ca. 100 CE.). As urban centers, these were very important, with an advanced and <b>hierarchized</b> society. Copilco's decline began early in the 1st century BCE, with the increasing rise of Teotihuacán as an important cultural and religious center. By 400 CE, the Xitle volcano located in the vicinity of the Ajusc, erupted, burying and destroying what still remained of Cuicuilco and Copilco, as important ceremonial centers.

50|$|The {{dominant}} {{nexus of}} hikikomori {{centers on the}} transformation from youth to the responsibilities and expectations of adult life. Indications are that advanced industrialised societies such as modern Japan fail to provide sufficient meaningful transformation rituals for promoting certain susceptible types of youth into mature roles. As do many societies, Japan exerts {{a great deal of}} pressure on adolescents to be successful and perpetuate the existing social status quo. A traditionally strong emphasis on complex social conduct, rigid hierarchies and the resulting, potentially intimidating multitude of social expectations, responsibilities and duties in Japanese society contribute to this pressure on young adults. Historically, Confucian teachings de-emphasizing the individual and favoring a conformist stance to ensure social harmony in a rigidly <b>hierarchized</b> society have shaped much of East Asia, possibly explaining the emergence of the hikikomori phenomenon in other East Asian countries.|$|E
