5|$|GRCs {{have been}} criticized as {{creating}} unequal voting powers between electors. At present, one vote in a GRC ward returns five or six candidates into Parliament, compared with one vote in a SMC ward, which only returns one candidate. The GRC scheme has also diluted electors' voting power. For instance, in an SMC ward there are around 14,000 voters, compared to 140,000 voters in a five- or six-member GRC. Thus, the power of each vote in a GRC is lower than in an SMC, as each voter in a GRC finds it harder to vote out an MP {{that he or she}} does not like. The situation is {{compounded by the fact that}} a 30% <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> equality of electoral divisions is tolerated. Another commentator has pointed out that the current MP-to-voter guide ratio is one MP to 26,000 voters, which implies that the number of voters in an electoral division can vary between 18,200 and 33,800. By extrapolation, a five-member GRC can have between 91,000 and 169,000 voters, a difference of 86%.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Ka, {{which is a}} measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer, Kb {{is a measure of}} how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, bending modulus is defined as the energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero. If a particular lipid has too large a <b>deviation</b> <b>from</b> zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as micelles or inverted micelles. Addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase. Typically, Kb is not measured experimentally but rather is calculated from measurements of Ka and bilayer thickness, since the three parameters are related.|$|E

If the trad-ing activity of informed investors {{is an important}} driver of <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> put-call parity, then the predictability of stock returns should be more pronounced during major information events. This paper investigates whether the predictability of equity returns by <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> put-call parity is stronger during earnings announcement periods. These deviations are measured by the implied volatil-ity spreads between pairs of matched put and call options. During a two-day earnings announcement window, the abnormal returns to a portfolio that buys stocks with relatively expensive call options is about 2 percent greater than the abnormal returns to a portfolio that buys stocks with relatively expensive put options. This result is robust after (i) measuring <b>deviations</b> <b>from</b> put-call parity in alternative ways, (ii) using value-weighted portfolio returns, and (iii) controlling for contemporaneous and lagged risk factors and lagged stock returns.
