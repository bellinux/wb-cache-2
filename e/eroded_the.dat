5|$|During the storm's onslaught, David dropped up to {{10 inches}} (250 mm) of rain, causing {{numerous}} landslides on the mountainous island. Hours of hurricane-force winds severely <b>eroded</b> <b>the</b> coastlines and washed out coastal roads.|$|E
5|$|Bolesław III, {{the last}} duke {{of the early}} period, succeeded in {{defending}} his country and recovering territories previously lost. Upon his death in 1138, Poland was divided among his sons. The resulting internal fragmentation <b>eroded</b> <b>the</b> initial Piast monarchical structure in the 12th and 13th centuries and caused fundamental and lasting changes.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s the {{sculpture}} was crumbling; cracks had developed, {{details of the}} figures had worn away, and moisture had <b>eroded</b> <b>the</b> internal structure. In wintertime the fountain had to be protected by a tarp. Weather, air pollution, and vandalism meant that {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars were now needed for restoration.|$|E

5|$|During the ice ages of {{the last}} two million years the Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas have been covered by the {{expanded}} polar ice cap several times. As the ice moved it <b>eroded</b> <b>the</b> rock, filling the river canyons with gravel. In some sections the rivers have cut through the gravel and flow swiftly over bedrock, and in some areas large boulders have fallen into the rivers and formed rapids.|$|E
5|$|International flights that {{bypassed}} traditional hub {{airports and}} landed at smaller cities became more common throughout the 1980s, and this <b>eroded</b> <b>the</b> 747's original market. However, many international carriers {{continued to use}} the 747 on Pacific routes. In Japan, 747s on domestic routes were configured to carry close to the maximum passenger capacity.|$|E
5|$|Stela 10 {{was found}} in Group 21 {{together}} with Altar 6. They are among the very few monuments that were placed outside of the ceremonial centre of the city. Stela 10 was carved with a frame containing a figure, now badly <b>eroded.</b> <b>The</b> figure is standing with feet separated and turned outwards. Small hieroglyphic panels accompany it. Stela 10 had been moved from its original location, which was probably somewhere nearby.|$|E

5|$|The UERL's {{ownership}} of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of revenues, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways.

5|$|Emperors {{could choose}} whether to {{supervise}} the policy bureaucracy or to pursue scholarship, cults, hobbies, or women instead. However, Frederick W. Mote argues that most Song emperors – who spent much of their childhood confined and isolated within a luxurious palace – were aloof conformists detached {{from the world of}} normal affairs and thus relied on officialdom to administer the government. While the mainstream view is that the Song court exercised the highest degree of restraint and courtesy towards civil officials, the new protocol of enhanced deferential treatment by officials towards the emperor during conferences and meetings further <b>eroded</b> <b>the</b> emperor's close contact with his ministers.|$|E
5|$|In 1348 {{a plague}} {{known as the}} Black Death crossed from {{mainland}} Europe into England, rapidly killing an estimated 50 per cent of the population. After an initial period of economic shock, England began {{to adapt to the}} changed economic situation. The death rate among the peasantry meant that suddenly land was relatively plentiful and manpower in much shorter supply. Labourers could charge more for their work and, in the consequent competition for labour, wages were driven sharply upwards. In turn, the profits of landowners were <b>eroded.</b> <b>The</b> trading, commercial and financial networks in the towns disintegrated.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{another study}} was {{published}} describing the integument and dermis of Psittacosaurus sp., {{from two different}} specimens. The skin remains could be observed by a natural cross-section to compare them to modern animals, showing that dinosaurian dermal layers evolved in parallel to those in many other large vertebrates. The collagen tissue fibres in Psittacosaurus are complex, virtually identical to all other vertebrates in structure but having an exceptional thickness of about forty layers. As the sections of dermis were collected from the abdomen, where the scales were <b>eroded,</b> <b>the</b> tissue may have assisted with the musculature of the stomach and intestines and offered protection against predators.|$|E

5|$|Initially exhibiting {{characteristics}} of a monsoonal low, a mid-level ridge {{to the south of}} Graham caused strong westerly winds that moved the storm slowly east-southeastward. However, a deep trough <b>eroded</b> <b>the</b> ridge, allowing the cyclone to move more towards the south. According to the JTWC, the storm had intensified late on 28 February, though {{at the same time the}} BoM noted the slight weakening of the storm. Graham reached its peak intensity that day while nearing the coast.|$|E
5|$|Kinship was agnatic, with descent counted {{only through}} the male line, helping to build the {{importance}} of surnames and clans. The increased {{power of the state}} and economic change <b>eroded</b> <b>the</b> power of these organisations, and this process would accelerate as the government responded to the threat of Jacobite risings by undermining the power of clan chiefs in the eighteenth century. The Reformation had a major impact on family life, changing the nature of baptism, marriage and burials, leading to a change in wider relationships, sacramental status and burial practices and placing a greater emphasis {{on the role of the}} father.|$|E
5|$|Mount Thielsen, or Big Cowhorn (Klamath: hisc’akwaleeʔas), is an extinct {{shield volcano}} in the Oregon High Cascades, near Mount Bailey. Because eruptive {{activity}} ceased 250,000years ago, glaciers have heavily <b>eroded</b> <b>the</b> volcano's structure, creating precipitous slopes and a horn-like peak. The spire-like shape of Thielsen attracts lightning strikes and creates fulgurite, an unusual mineral. The prominent horn forms a centerpiece for the Mount Thielsen Wilderness, a reserve for recreational {{activities such as}} skiing and hiking.|$|E

5|$|Older {{and more}} deeply <b>eroded,</b> <b>the</b> Western Cascades are {{a range of}} volcanoes lying west of and merging with the High Cascades. They consist of partly altered {{volcanic}} rock from vents in both volcanic provinces, including varied lavas and ash tuffs {{ranging in age from}} 0 to 40million years. As the Cascades rose, the Rogue maintained its flow to the ocean by down-cutting, which created steep narrow gorges and rapids in many places. Bear Creek, a Rogue tributary that flows south to north, marks the boundary between the Western Cascades to the east and the Klamath Mountains to the west.|$|E
5|$|Paul Cornell, {{a lawyer}} and real estate developer, donated and built East End Park between 51st and 53rd Streets in 1856. After much of the land <b>eroded,</b> <b>the</b> {{property}} was incorporated into Burnham Park and was eventually renamed Harold Washington Park in 1992. In the years following his donation, expansions were built at {{the northeast corner of}} the future Jackson Park, located {{at the south end of}} Burnham. The most notable expansions included a seawall and granite paved strolling beach, constructed from 1884 to 1888, and a building used as the Iowa Pavilion during the Columbian Exposition.|$|E
