For instance, predictive control <b>of</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>redundancy</b> further regulates the endpoint impedance in addition to co-contractions. Inspired by these observations, this paper proposes a novel Tele-Impedance algorithm that replicates the human’s arm endpoint stiffness in robot by controlling the common-mode and configuration-dependent stiffness. Design of the controller and its stability is addressed and experimentally evaluated in robotic peg-in-hole task. Results of the proposed method are compared to the ones derived from Tele-Impedance implemented using classical Cartesian stiffness control.

Towards this purpose, kinematic redundancy is exploited {{in order to}} achieve optimized performance. Inspired by the superior motor skills of humans, in this paper, we investigate a combined free motion and interaction controller in a certain class of robotic manipulation. In this bimodal controller, kinematic <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>redundancy</b> are adapted according to task-suitable dynamic costs. The proposed algorithm attributes high priority to minimum-effort controller while performing point to point free space movements. Once the robot comes in contact with the environment, the Tele-Impedance, common mode and configuration dependent stiffness (CMS-CDS) controller will replicate the human’s estimated endpoint stiffness and measured equilibrium position profiles in the slave robotic arm, in real-time. Results of the proposed controller in contact with the environment are compared with the ones derived from Tele-Impedance implemented using torque based classical Cartesian stiffness control. The minimum-effort and interaction performance achieved highlights the possibility of adopting human-like and sophisticated strategies in humanoid robots or the ones with adequate <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>redundancy,</b> in order to accomplish tasks in a certain class of robotic manipulatio...|$|R

Since S. cerevisiae homologues represent the majority of the genes identified in the genomes studied, the overall <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> gene <b>redundancy</b> seems conserved across all species.

40|$|The {{conventional}} definition <b>of</b> <b>redundancy</b> {{is applicable}} to skeletal structural systems only, whereas the concept <b>of</b> <b>redundancy</b> {{has never been}} discussed {{in the context of}} a continuum. Generally, structures in civil engineering constitute a combination of both skeletal and continuum segments. Hence, this gaper presents a generalized definition <b>of</b> <b>redundancy</b> that has been defined in terms of structural response sensitivity, which is applicable to both continuum and discrete structures. In contrast to the conventional definition <b>of</b> <b>redundancy,</b> which is assumed to be fixed for a given structure and is believed to be independent of loading and material properties, the new definition would depend on strength and response of the structure at a given stage of its service life. The redundancy measure proposed in this paper is linked to the structural response sensitivities. Thus, the structure can have different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>redundancy</b> during its lifetime, depending on the response sensitivity under consideration It is believed that this new redundancy measure would be more relevant in structural evaluation, damage assessment, and reliability analysis of structures at large...|$|R

50|$|The Internet, and {{consequently}} its backbone networks, do {{not rely on}} central control or coordinating facilities, nor do they implement any global network policies.

In addition, the high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>redundancy</b> of today's network links and sophisticated real-time routing protocols provide alternate paths of communications for load balancing and congestion avoidance.|$|E
