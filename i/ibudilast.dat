40|$|Background Medication overuse {{headache}} (MOH) is {{a condition}} bordering between a chronic pain condition and a substance dependence disorder. Activation of immunocompetent glial cells in {{the central nervous system}} has been linked to both pathological pain and drug addiction/reward. Preclinically, <b>ibudilast</b> attenuates glial activation and is able to reduce neuropathic pain and markers of substance dependence. We therefore hypothesized <b>ibudilast</b> would reduce headache burden and opioid analgesic requirements in patients with opioid overuse headache. Objective To determine if treatment with <b>ibudilast</b> provides a greater reduction in headache index than placebo in MOH patients consuming opioids. Methods Participants with MOH who were using opioids were randomized via computer-generated code to <b>ibudilast</b> 40 mg or placebo twice daily for 8 weeks in a double-blind, parallel groups study. Before randomization participants completed a 4 -week baseline headache diary. During treatment, headache diary data collection continued and participants attended 4 study visits during which quantitative sensory testing was performed. Blood samples for immune biomarker analyses were collected before and after treatment in a subgroup of participants. Results Thirty-four participants were randomized, 13 of 15 randomized to <b>ibudilast</b> and 17 of 19 randomized to placebo completed treatment. <b>Ibudilast</b> was generally well-tolerated with mild, transient nausea reported as the most common adverse event (66. 7 % vs 10. 5 % in placebo group). Results are shown as mean (SD). At the end of treatment no differences in the primary outcome average daily headache index (placebo 62 [44] vs <b>ibudilast</b> 77 [72] groups, difference − 15, CI − 65 to 35 h × numerical rating scale), or secondary outcomes headache frequency (placebo 23 [8. 1] vs <b>ibudilast</b> 24. 5 [6. 2], difference − 1. 5, CI − 7. 7 to 4. 8 days/month) and opioid intake (placebo 20. 6 [43] vs <b>ibudilast</b> 19 [24. 3], difference 1. 6, CI − 31. 5 to 34. 8 mg morphine equivalent) were observed between placebo and <b>ibudilast</b> groups. Conclusions Using the current dosing regimen, <b>ibudilast</b> does not improve headache or reduce opioid use in patients with MOH without mandated opioid withdrawal. However, it would be of interest to determine in future trials if <b>ibudilast</b> is able to improve ease of withdrawal during a forced opioid down-titration when incorporated into an MOH detoxification program.

40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of <b>ibudilast</b> after a single-dose and a multiple-dose regimen. METHODS: Healthy adult male (n = 9) and female (n = 9) volunteers were evaluated over a 17 -day {{stay in a}} Phase 1 unit. Subjects were randomized 1 : 3 to either oral placebo or <b>ibudilast</b> at 30 -mg single administration followed by 14 days of 30 mg b. i. d. Complete safety analyses were performed and, for PK, plasma and urine samples were analysed for <b>ibudilast</b> and its major metabolite. RESULTS: <b>Ibudilast</b> was generally well tolerated. No serious adverse events occurred. Treatment-related adverse events included hyperhidrosis, headache and nausea. Two subjects discontinued {{after a few days}} at 30 mg b. i. d. because of vomiting. Although samples sizes were too small to rule out a sex difference, PK were similar in men and women. The mean half-life for <b>ibudilast</b> was 19 h and median T(max) was 4 - 6 h.

40|$|BACKGROUND:: <b>Ibudilast</b> is a {{phosphodiesterase}} inhibitor influencing {{inflammation and}} neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS). This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and effects on MRI parameters of 2 different doses of <b>ibudilast</b> in relapsing forms of MS. METHODS:: In this multicenter, double-blind, phase 2 trial, patients with relapsing MS and gadolinium-enhancing lesions {{were randomly assigned}} 1 : 1 : 1 to receive 30 or 60 mg <b>ibudilast</b> or placebo every day for 12 months. The primary endpoint was the cumulative number of newly active lesions on bimonthly brain MRI over 12 months. Secondary endpoints included relapse rate, change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, T 2 -hyperintense and T 1 -hypointense lesion volumes, and percent brain volume change (PBVC). RESULTS:: A total of 297 patients were randomized in 19 centers. During the first 12 months, {{the mean number of}} active lesions and relapse rate did not differ between treatment arms. A reduction in PBVC (p = 0. 04) was found in the 60 -mg group (0. 8 %) compared with placebo (1. 2 %). Post hoc analysis showed a reduction in the proportion active lesions that evolved into persistent black holes for the 60 -mg (0. 14; p = 0. 004) and 30 -mg (0. 17; p = 0. 036) groups compared with the placebo group (0. 24). Over 2 years, there were fewer patients (p = 0. 026) with confirmed progression on the EDSS. Treatment with <b>ibudilast</b> was generally safe and well tolerated.

40|$|Methamphetamine is a {{psychomotor}} stimulant {{that produces}} hyperactivity and euphoria {{and can lead}} to drug-seeking and abuse. An estimate from 2005 put the cost of methamphetamine abuse to society at an estimated 23. 4 billion dollars. One of methamphetamine 2 ̆ 7 s effects is activation of glial cells and associated neuroinflammatory activity in the periphery and CNS. Glia are responsible for maintaining calcium homeostasis, neuroplasticity, immune activity, and cell signaling. Activation of glia and neuroinflammation are becoming recognized as links in drug abuse-related behavior. The goal of the present work was to assess the ability of <b>ibudilast,</b> AV 1013, and minocycline, three glial cell modulating compounds, to attenuate responding in rodent procedures that model different aspects of methamphetamine abuse-related behavior. First, <b>Ibudilast</b> (1. 8, 7. 5, 13 mg/kg) and AV 1013 (10, 30, 56 mg/kg) were examined for their effects on methamphetamine-induced (3 mg/kg) locomotor activity and sensitization in mice, the latter thought to involve neurocircuitry common with drug relapse. <b>Ibudilast</b> and AV 1013 dose-dependently attenuated methamphetamine-induced locomotor activity and its sensitization. Second, <b>ibudilast</b> (1, 7. 5, 10 mg/kg), AV 1013 (1, 10, 30 mg/kg), and minocycline (10, 30, 60 mg/kg) were examined for their effects on methamphetamine self-administration (0. 001, 0. 03, and 0. 1 mg/kg/inf) in rats. All three compounds significantly reduced methamphetamine (0. 03 mg/kg/inf) self-administration. Results suggested baseline self-administration rate as a possible determinant of these effects; however, follow-up tests with <b>ibudilast</b> while controlling for baseline response rate dismissed this possibility. Additional follow-up tests identified whether the attenuation of operant response rates was specific to methamphetamine-maintained behavior. Using a behavioral economic approach, all three test compounds were determined to also affect non-nutritive banana pellet-maintained responding when the baseline strengths maintained by methamphetamine and banana pellet delivery were matched. Finally, <b>ibudilast</b> was evaluated for its effects on methamphetamine discrimination in rats, a procedure thought to model clinical subjective effects. <b>Ibudilast</b> (1, 7. 5, 10 mg/kg) did not significantly modify methamphetamine’s discriminative stimulus effects when trained at either 1 or 0. 56 mg/kg.

40|$|Abstract Background Twitcher mouse (twi/twi) is an {{authentic}} murine model of Krabbe's disease. Accumulation of psychosine, resulting in apoptosis of oligodendrocytes and subsequent demyelination, is a cardinal event to {{the pathogenesis of}} this disease. Moreover, recruitment of inflammatory cells {{plays a significant role}} in the pathological process in the twi/twi central and peripheral nervous systems. In this study, we investigated the 1) the relationship between tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), pro-inflammatory cytokine, and the progression of this disease and 2) effect of the anti-inflammatory therapy by <b>ibudilast,</b> a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Methods We quantified the expression level of TNFα and TNF-receptor mRNA in twi/twi using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The relationship between TNFα expression, apoptosis of oligodendrocytes and demyelination was studied with immunohistochemistry and TUNEL method. We then treated twi/twi with a daily intraperitoneal injection of <b>ibudilast</b> (10 mg/kg), which suppress TNFα production in the brain. Results We found that TNFα-immunoreactive microglia/macrophages appeared in the twi/twi brain and that the mRNA levels of TNFα and TNF-receptor 1 was increased with the progression of demyelination. The distribution profile of TNFα-immunoreactive microglia/macrophages overlapped that of TUNEL-positive oligodendrocytes in the twi/twi brain. When twi/twi was treated with <b>ibudilast</b> from PND 30, the number of oligodendrocytes undergoing apoptosis was markedly reduced and demyelination was milder. Obvious improvement of clinical symptom was noted in two of five. The failure of constant clinical improvement by <b>ibudilast</b> may result from hepatotoxicity and/or the inhibition of proliferation of NG 2 -positive oligodendrocyte precursors. Conclusion We conclude that anti-inflammatory therapy by a phosphodiesterase inhibitor can be considered as a novel alternative therapy for Krabbe's disease. </p...|$|E
40|$|Codeine is {{the most}} widely {{consumed}} opioid analgesic worldwide. It relies upon partial metabolism to morphine to elicit analgesic effects. Paradoxically, the pain-reliever morphine has previously been linked to states of increased pain sensitivity; such as medication overuse headache and opioid-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia. Despite the clinical impact of medication overuse headache the pathophysiology behind this disorder remains unclear and mechanism-based treatments are lacking. Although most acute headache treatments are alleged to cause medication overuse headache, within this thesis we conclude from the literature opioids are the drug class most strongly associated with worsening headache. In opioid-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia sensitivity to normally noxious, and non-noxious stimuli respectively, are enhanced due to opioid exposure. Chronic morphine may exacerbate pain in the long-term by non-specifically activating toll-like receptor- 4 (TLR 4) on glial cells, resulting in a pro-inflammatory state that manifests clinically as increased pain. Here we hypothesise medication overuse headache is a specific form of opioid-induced hyperalgesia, which derives from a cumulative interaction between central sensitisation and glial priming, due to repeated activation of nociceptive pathways by recurrent headaches, and pain facilitation due to glial activation and subsequent neuroinflammation. The {{first part of this}} thesis examines the efficacy of a glial-attenuating treatment, <b>ibudilast,</b> in the clinical management of medication overuse headache induced by opioid use in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled parallel group study. Patients received <b>ibudilast</b> 40 mg twice daily or placebo for I weeks and recorded headache and analgesic intake using a headache diary for 4 -weeks prior to randomisation and throughout the treatment phase. No reduction in headache burden, opioid analgesic intake or headache related quality of life were observed in the <b>ibudilast</b> group compared to placebo, however, valuable safety data were obtained demonstrating <b>ibudilast</b> 80 mg/day is well tolerated, facilitating the use of similarly high doses in future studies for alternative indications. Prior to this PhD project the relationship between codeine and increased pain sensitivity had not been investigated. ln silico docking simulations performed as part of this PhD suggest codeine binds to MD 2, an accessory protein forTLR 4, signifying it may be able to induce hyperalgesia independent of conversion to morphine. Evidence that codeine can induce hyperalgesia would sit in line with our glial hypothesis for opioid overuse headache. Thus, the second part of this PhD includes a series of preclinical experiments to 1.) determine if chronic codeine alters pain sensitivity 2) ascertain if pre-existing glial activation primes for opioid-induced hyperalgesia, 3) investigate signalling pathways involved and 4) assess potential interventions to reverse exacerbated pain sensitivity. Hyperalgesia and allodynia were measured using hot plate and von Frey tests respectively, at baseline, day 3 and day 5 in mice receiving intraperitoneal codeine 2 t mg/kg, morphine 20 mg/kg or saline, twice daily. Our preclinical studies demonstrate that despite providing lesser acute analgesia, equimolar codeine and morphine induced similar hot plate hyperalgesia, suggesting codeine does not rely upon conversion to morphine to increase pain sensitivity, emphasising the non-opioid receptor-dependent nature of this phenomenon. lL-RA reversed codeine-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia, and knock-out of TLR 4 protected against codeine-induced pain sensitivity changes. Glial attenuation with <b>ibudilast</b> reversed codeine-induced allodynia and thus could be investigated as potential treatment for conditions involving codeine-induced pain enhancement. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|Chronic pain {{biomarkers}} {{can assist}} clinicians to diagnose patients, identify underlying mechanisms of disease, reduce {{the time and}} cost to reach a decision in early clinical trials and guide personalized pain treatments. Unfortunately, to date, there is no validated biomarker for chronic pain due to the difficulty in accessing the central nervous system. However, emerging literature has consistently provided evidence for {{the involvement of the}} immune system to play a substantial role in the modulation of chronic pain. Thus, this thesis examines components of the immune system such as Toll like receptor (TLR) signalling, peripheral immune cells and pro-inflammatory cytokine as an accessible source which may mirror similarities in brain immune cells and capture the changes in chronic pain state. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis was to examine the use of peripheral immune cell reactivity as a potential biomarker for chronic pain. The first study was conducted in heterogeneous chronic pain and pain-free cohorts. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and stimulated with various TLR agonists to generate a pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) concentration response curve. Chronic pain patients displayed significantly enhanced expression of IL- 1 β compared with the pain-free cohort hence the TLR responsiveness demonstrated face validity as a chronic pain biomarker. The second study demonstrated the translatability of the importance of TLR responsiveness in a preclinical neuropathic pain model. IL- 1 β levels were quantified from basal and TLR 2 / 4 agonist stimulated isolated rat PBMCs and spinal cord tissues, and together with the behaviour responses were used to generate statistical models. The main findings of this study were the inclusion of basal and TLR agonist stimulated outputs were required to predict the presence of pain and severity of allodynia with high sensitivity and specificity and that peripherally collected outputs correlated with the outputs from the spinal cord, suggesting the ability of peripheral outputs to give insight into central signalling. In addition, a mathematical model developed from rat studies using peripheral and central tissues was able to identify chronic pain patients by their peripheral blood response with high accuracy. The final study assessed TLR responsiveness of isolated PBMCs collected from a cohort of medication overuse headache (MOH) patients to determine the efficacy of a novel treatment for headache (<b>ibudilast).</b> This study consisted of MOH patients on 8 weeks of either placebo or <b>ibudilast</b> treatments. After 8 weeks of treatment, both groups did not experience a change in their headache frequency or intensity. However, a significant reduction in the TLR responsiveness occurred in the <b>ibudilast</b> group. These data provide the first evidence of a biomarker for <b>ibudilast</b> treatment. In sum, this thesis provides evidence that peripheral cells are a good source to be biomarker for chronic pain and the importance to assess TLR signalling as an approach to capture the dysregulated immune system as a result of chronic pain. The discovered biomarkers require further replication and validation before than can be routinely used. However, the present finding can assist with the development of future cellular biomarkers for chronic pain. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Medical Sciences, 201...|$|E

40|$|Over 180 {{million people}} consume {{cannabis}} globally. Cannabis use peaks during adolescence with a trend for continued consumption by adults. Notably, {{several studies have}} shown that long-term and heavy cannabis use during adolescence can impair brain maturation and predispose to neurodevelopmental disorders, although the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this association remain largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated whether, in female rats, chronic administration of increasing doses of the psychotropic plant-derived cannabis constituent, delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), during adolescence (PND 35 - 45) could affect microglia function in the long-term. Furthermore, we explored a possible contribution of microglia to the development of THC-induced alterations in mood and cognition in adult female rats. Present data indicate that adolescent THC administration induces a persistent neuroinflammatory state specifically localized within the adult prefrontal cortex (PFC), characterized by increased expression of the pro-inflammatory markers, TNF-α, iNOS and COX- 2, and reduction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL- 10. This neuroinflammatory phenotype is associated with down-regulation of CB 1 receptor on neuronal cells and up-regulation of CB 2 on microglia cells, conversely. Interestingly, blocking microglia activation with <b>ibudilast</b> during THC treatment significantly attenuates short-term memory impairments in adulthood, simultaneously preventing the increases in TNF-α, iNOS, COX- 2 levels as well as the up-regulation of CB 2 receptors on microglia cells. In contrast, THC-induced depressive-like behaviors were unaffected by <b>ibudilast</b> treatment.

40|$|Chronic {{morphine}} {{therapy has}} been associated with paradoxically increased pain. Codeine is a widely used opioid, which is metabolized to morphine to elicit analgesia. Prolonged morphine exposure exacerbates pain by activating the innate immune toll-like receptor- 4 (TLR 4) in the central nervous system. In silico docking simulations indicate codeine also docks to MD 2, an accessory protein for TLR 4, suggesting potential to induce TLR 4 -dependent pain facilitation. We hypothesized codeine would cause TLR 4 -dependent hyperalgesia/allodynia that is disparate from its opioid receptor-dependent analgesic rank potency. Hyperalgesia and allodynia were assessed using hotplate and von Frey tests at days 0, 3 and 5 in mice receiving intraperitoneal equimolar codeine (21 [*]mg[*]kg(- 1)), morphine (20 [*]mg[*]kg(- 1)) or saline, twice daily. This experiment was repeated in animals with prior partial nerve injury and in TLR 4 null mutant mice. Interventions with interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 RA) and glial-attenuating drug <b>ibudilast</b> were assessed. Analyses of glial activation markers (glial fibrillary acid protein and CD 11 b) in neuronal tissue were conducted at the completion of behavioural testing. Despite providing less acute analgesia (P= 0. 006), codeine induced similar hotplate hyperalgesia to equimolar morphine vs saline (- 9. 5 [*]s, P< 0. 01 and - 7. 3 [*]s, P< 0. 01, respectively), suggesting codeine does not rely upon conversion to morphine to increase pain sensitivity. This highlights the potential non-opioid receptor-dependent nature of codeine-enhanced pain sensitivity-although the involvement of other codeine metabolites cannot be ruled out. IL- 1 RA reversed codeine-induced hyperalgesia (P< 0. 001) and allodynia (P< 0. 001), and TLR 4 knock-out protected against codeine-induced changes in pain sensitivity. Glial attenuation with <b>ibudilast</b> reversed codeine-induced allodynia (P< 0. 001), and thus could be investigated further as potential treatment for codeine-induced pain enhancement.

40|$|Delirium is {{a serious}} medical {{condition}} that commonly afflicts elderly inpatients. This is especially common in the post-operative setting where it increases mortality, length of hospital stay and health care costs. The exact mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis remain uncertain and there is currently no effective pharmacological therapy for treatment or prevention of delirium. We hypothesize that microglia-mediated neuroinflammation via toll-like receptor 4 signalling is a significant contributor to post-operative delirium. Based on our proposed mechanism, three novel pharmacological therapies have been suggested to be effective to prevent or treat delirium. Curcumin, <b>ibudilast</b> and minocycline {{have been shown to}} interfere with various steps in the proinflammatory microglial activation intracellular signalling pathway, disrupting the subsequent neuroinflammatory cascade. We hypothesize that these drugs could be a novel pharmacotherapy that could significantly improve the outcome of post-operative delirious patients.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop and}} {{implement}} an evidence based framework to select, from drugs already licenced, candidate oral neuroprotective drugs to be tested in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Design: Systematic review of clinical studies of oral putative neuroprotective therapies in MS and four other neurodegenerative diseases with shared pathological features, followed by systematic review and meta-analyses of the in vivo experimental data for those interventions. We presented summary data to an international multi-disciplinary committee, which assessed each drug in turn using pre-specified criteria including consideration of mechanism of action. Results: We identified {{a short list of}} fifty-two candidate interventions. After review of all clinical and pre-clinical evidence we identified <b>ibudilast,</b> riluzole, amiloride, pirfenidone, fluoxetine, oxcarbazepine, and the polyunsaturated fatty-acid class (Linoleic Acid, Lipoic acid; Omega- 3 fatty acid, Max EPA oil) as lead candidates for clinical evaluation. Conclusions: We demonstrate a standardised and systematic approach to candidate identification for drug rescue and repurposing trials that can be applied widely to neurodegenerative disorders...|$|E
40|$|The effects o f {{phosphodiesterase}} inhibitors (PDEIs) on interleukin (IL) - 12 productio n by microglia, antigen-pr esenting {{cells in}} the central ner vous system (CNS), were examined to learn how they affect T cell differentiatio n in the CNS. PDEIs significantly suppressed the microglial IL- 12 productio n, as determined by reverse transcr iptase-po lymerase chain reaction for IL- 12 p 35 and p 40 mRNA expression and by an ELISA specific for IL- 12 functional hetero dimer, p 70. In addition, the PDEI <b>ibudilast</b> also suppressed inter feron-g, but not IL- 4 or IL- 10, productio n by myelin o ligodendro cyte glycoprotein (MOG) -specific T cells reactivated with MOG {{in the presence of}} microglia. Thus, PDEIs may also suppress differentiatio n of T helper 1 (Th 1) in the CNS. PDEIs can be of use for future therapeutic strategy to treat Th 1 -mediated diseases, such as multiple sclerosis...|$|E
40|$|Studies have implicated neuroinflammatory {{processes}} in the pathophysiology of various psychiatric conditions, including addictive disorders. Neuroimmune signaling represents an important and relatively poorly understood biological process in drug addiction. The objective of this review is to update the field on recent developments in neuroimmune therapies for addiction. First, we review studies of neuroinflammation in relation to alcohol and methamphetamine dependence followed by a section on neuroinflammation and accompanying neurocognitive dysfunction in HIV infection and concomitant substance abuse. Second, we provide a review of pharmacotherapies with neuroimmune properties and their potential development {{for the treatment of}} addictions. Pharmacotherapies covered in this review include <b>ibudilast,</b> minocycline, doxycycline, topiramate, indomethacin, rolipram, anakinra (IL- 1 Ra), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists, naltrexone, and naloxone. Lastly, summary and future directions are provided with recommendations for how to efficiently translate preclinical findings into clinical studies that can ultimately lead to novel and more effective pharmacotherapies for addiction. © 2014 Elsevier Inc...|$|E
40|$|Both {{genetic and}} {{environmental}} factors are thought to contribute to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders with maternal immune activation (MIA) being {{a risk factor for}} both autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. Although MIA mouse offspring exhibit behavioral impairments, the synaptic alterations in vivo that mediate these behaviors are not known. Here we employed in vivo multiphoton imaging to determine that in the cortex of young MIA offspring there is a reduction in number and turnover rates of dendritic spines, sites of majority of excitatory synaptic inputs. Significantly, spine impairments persisted into adulthood and correlated with increased repetitive behavior, an ASD relevant behavioral phenotype. Structural analysis of synaptic inputs revealed a reorganization of presynaptic inputs with a larger proportion of spines being contacted by both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals. These structural impairments were accompanied by altered excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. Finally, we report that a postnatal treatment of MIA offspring with the anti-inflammatory drug <b>ibudilast,</b> prevented both synaptic and behavioral impairments. Our results suggest that a possible altered inflammatory state associated with maternal immune activation results in impaired synaptic development that persists into adulthood but which can be prevented with early anti-inflammatory treatment.

40|$|<b>Ibudilast</b> (IBD) is a non-selective (3, 4, 10, 11) {{phosphodiesterase}} (PDE) inhibitor, used {{mainly as}} a bronchodilator {{for the treatment}} of bronchial asthma. PDE {{play a central role in}} cellular function (e. g. differentiation, synaptic plasticity and inflammatory response) by metabolizing cyclic nucleotides. The results from preclinical and clinical studies indicate that IBD has a broader range of action through suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL- 6, IL- 1 β, TNF-α), toll-like receptor 4 blockade (TLR- 4), inhibition of a macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), up-regulation the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL- 10), and promotion of neurotrophic factors (GDNF, NGF, NT- 4). Recent data indicate that the efficacy of IBD appears to be independent from PDE inhibition activity and rather linked to glial activity attenuation. Additional advantages of IBD, such as crossing the blood–brain barrier, good tolerance and activity by oral administration, makes it a promising therapeutic candidate for treating neuroinflammatory conditions, where the currently available treatment remains unsatisfying due to poor tolerability and/or sub-optimal efficacy. IBD has no direct receptor affinity with exemption of some undefined effect on adenosine receptors that makes the drug devoid of its receptors-mediated adverse effects. Current article provides an overview of the pharmacology of IBD with a focus on preclinical and clinical data supporting its potential neuroprotective benefits for neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain, medication overuse headache, stroke, opioid, alcohol and methamphetamine abuse...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{degeneration}} of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in Parkinson's disease (PD) {{is associated}} with the inflammation process and decreased levels of cyclic nucleotides, inhibition of up-regulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) appears to be a promising therapeutic strategy. We used <b>ibudilast</b> (IBD), a non-selective PDE 3, 4, 10, 11 inhibitor, due to the abundant PDE 4 and 10 expression in the striatum. The present study for the first time examined the efficacy of IBD in the 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. IBD [0, 20, 30, 40, or 50 mg/kg] was injected b. i. d. subcutaneously for nine days to three-month-old male C 57 Bl/ 10 Tar mice, beginning two days prior to MPTP (60 mg/kg) intoxication. High-pressure liquid chromatography, Western blot analysis, and real time RT-PCR methods were applied. Our study demonstrated that chronic administration of IBD attenuated astroglial reactivity and increased glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) production in the striatum. Moreover, IBD reduced TNF-α, IL- 6, and IL- 1 β expression. IBD had a well-defined effect on astroglial activation in the mouse model of PD; however, there was no protective effect in the acute phase of injury. Diminished inflammation and an increased level of GDNF may provide a better outcome in the later stages of neurodegeneration...|$|E
40|$|Phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4, and to {{a lesser}} extent, PDE 3 / 4 inhibitors have {{attracted}} considerable interest as potential therapeutic agents for diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Indeed, <b>ibudilast</b> and theophylline are utilized clinically, and roflumilast is in late-stage clinical development. Unfortunately, however many PDE 4 and dual PDE 3 / 4 inhibitors have failed in early development due to low therapeutic ratios. The majority of these compounds are however orally administered and non-selective for either PDE 3 (A, B) or PDE 4 (A, B, C, D) subtypes. Developing an inhaled dual PDE 3 / 4 inhibitor with subtype specificity may represent one strategy to improve the therapeutic index. Indeed combined inhibition of PDE 3 and PDE 4 inhibitor has additive and synergistic anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory effects versus inhibition of either PDE 3 or PDE 4 alone. Given that synergy has been seen in terms of efficacy end points, an obvious concern is that synergy may also be observed in side effects. Interestingly, however, no synergy or additive effects with a combination of a PDE 3 and PDE 4 inhibitor in a cardiomyocyte assay were observed. This review will summarize the rationale for developing an inhaled dual PDE 3 / 4 inhibitor, as a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease together with recent advances in trying to understand the pathogenesis of PDE inhibitor-induced mesenteric vasculitis (a key potential dose-limiting side effect of these agents), highlighting potential early and sensitive predictive biomarkers...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} component of drug addiction research involves identifying novel biological mechanisms and environmental predictors of risk or resilience to drug addiction and associated relapse. Increasing evidence suggests microglia and astrocytes can profoundly affect the physiological and addictive properties of drugs of abuse, including morphine. We report that glia within the rat nucleus accumbens (NAcc) respond to morphine {{with an increase in}} cytokine/chemokine expression, which predicts future reinstatement of morphine conditioned place preference (CPP) following a priming dose of morphine. This glial response to morphine is influenced by early-life experience. A neonatal handling paradigm that increases {{the quantity and quality of}} maternal care significantly increases baseline expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10 within the NAcc, attenuates morphine-induced glial activation, and prevents the subsequent reinstatement of morphine CPP in adulthood. IL- 10 expression within the NAcc and reinstatement of CPP are negatively correlated, suggesting a protective role for this specific cytokine against morphine-induced glial reactivity and drug-induced reinstatement of morphine CPP. Neonatal handling programs the expression of IL- 10 within the NAcc early in development, and this is maintained into adulthood via decreased methylation of the IL- 10 gene specifically within microglia. The effect of neonatal handling is mimicked by pharmacological modulation of glia in adulthood with <b>ibudilast,</b> which increases IL- 10 expression, inhibits morphine-induced glial activation within the NAcc, and prevents reinstatement of morphine CPP. Taken together, we have identified a novel gene × early-life environment interaction on morphine-induced glial activation and a specific role for glial activation in drug-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior.
