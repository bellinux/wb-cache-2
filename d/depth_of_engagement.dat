More specifically, it considers that role in relation to one political ‘field’ and one type of movement: a field which we refer to, following the work of Peter Sedgwick, as ‘psychopolitics’, and a movement which, since the mid- to late- 1980 s, has been known as the ‘psychiatric survivor’ movement—psychiatric patients and their allies who campaign for the democratisation of the mental health system.

40|$|AbstractScoring of {{the outer}} layers of a {{workpiece}} with small engagement (ae) using circular saws is a well known method to avoid unwanted delamination of these layers, such as coatings of wooden particle boards. In edge milling fibre reinforced plastics (FRP), delamination also occurs in the top or bottom layer of the component and requires time intensive rework or scrapping of material. A combined process of scoring and milling is {{presented in this paper}} as a means to avoid delamination during machining of FRP structures such as aircraft carbon FRP parts. For the scoring process a diamond electroplated circular wheel is used. To guarantee a constant width of the scored slot, a constant <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> is needed due to the shape of the grinding wheel. Therefore the profile of the scoring path on the workpiece surface is measured with respect to the machine coordinate system to correct a variation in the workpiece thickness and to compensate for uneven clamping. Next, the workpiece is scored with constant <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> (ae,s 50 μm) at an increased feed velocity (vf,m = 4. 5 m/min). Without scoring, flawed workpiece edges have been obtained with cutting edge radii beyond rn > 23 μm (progressive uniform wear stage) and a feed velocity of vf,m = 1. 5 m/min. Hence, high performance cutting (HPC) edge milling of composites may be realized by an initial scoring step to fulfil quality requirements of the machined edges and simultaneously increase the tool life of the milling tool...|$|E

This study draws on multiple traditional and contemporary theoretical frameworks to (1) uncover fundamental aspects of variability in meditation practice, (2) test the role of several primary and secondary processes believed to be responsible for positive effects, and (3) explore a range of positive and negative outcomes believed to be closely aligned with the original intended out-comes of meditation practices. Using two large (each N> 500) heterogeneous samples of meditation practitioners, this study calibrated and then cross-validated a theoretical model testing the plausibility of several causal pathways linking variation in experience with meditation to positive and negative psychological outcomes. Results showed that individual differences in meditation involve both behavioral aspects accounting for the degree <b>of</b> <b>engagement,</b> and psychological aspects incorporating the intensity or <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> this <b>engagement.</b> Variation in these aspects accounts for large proportions of variance in psychological health and functioning outcomes. Several factors representing attention refinement (mindfulness), changes in self-perception and outlook (transcendence), worldview (insight), and psychological development serve as plausible change mechanisms serving to transmit the effects of meditation on psychological health and functioning. ...|$|R

This chapter explores how Gaga fans, known as Little Monsters, are connecting with the star through social media platforms and ruminates on how the relationship between fan and celebrity is currently being affected by these new media forms. Building on work by Marwick and boyd (2011), and drawing on an online survey of Gaga fans that received 156 respondents, this chapter seeks to unravel the motivations and aspirations surrounding the online relationship between Gaga and her followers, adding valuably to our understandings of fan/celebrity relations. The study questions how fans perceive what could be termed as a ‘public private’ (Marshall 2010) self of the star positioned at the forefront of her Twitter postings, how engagement between celebrity and fan is negotiated and how fans subsequently understand their positioning amongst millions of followers on these social platforms. I argue that, in some instances, such as with Gaga and her fan community, the advent and widespread use of social media by stars is reconfiguring levels <b>of</b> connection and <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> between both celebrity and their associated fan communities. As this chapter and responses from the fan survey will show, Lady Gaga is skilfully using the social media platforms in such a way that not only combines public/private elements of herself, but also speaks directly to her fans as fellow partners alongside her, who are positioned as making an integral contribution to her work. This process works to encourage, within some fans, powerful feelings of direct connection and importance, despite being one amongst millions of followers...|$|R

We find differences between the approaches concerning the assumptions about stakeholder rationality and whether experts and/or stakeholders are in charge of framing the problem. Further differences concern the type of data input from stakeholders and how it is used by the experts, as well as the role of stakeholders and whether they are involved early—already for identifying options—or later in the process, for evaluating or ranking alternatives analyzed by the experts.
