25|$|Due to {{increased}} demand a new pumping plant was installed which started operation in 1886. The pumps were driven by Jonval turbines using the water {{power of the}} river Rhône.

40|$|Geothermal {{energy in}} the Province of North Sulawesi in Indonesia has {{potential}} to produce 865 MW of electricity. One of the geothermal prospects in North Sulawesi that has been developed to generate electricity is Lahendong geothermal field. Nine production wells have been drilled and produce two phase fluid (mixture between vapour and liquid) with temperature ranges from 250 oC to 350 oC. Currently, three 20 MW geothermal power plants have been constructed (Unit 1, Unit 2, and Unit 3) in the field. Power plant Unit 1 and Unit 2 have been operated to supply electricity, while Unit 3 is still undergoing operational tests since April 2009. The main objective of this dissertation is to calculate the <b>gross</b> electrical <b>power</b> of production wells in Lahendong geothermal field by using thermodynamic analysis for a single-flash steam plant. Unfortunately, only data of seven production wells (LHD- 8, LHD- 10, LHD- 11, LHD- 12, LHD- 15, LHD- 17, and LHD- 18) in June 2008 are available. The data consist of daily average of wellhead pressure of each production well and daily average of combined flow rates of the steam from the seven production wells {{that is used to}} drive the turbines in power plant Unit 1 and Unit 2 during June 2008. Therefore, the calculation is conducted based on the available data. Two kinds of calculations are conducted in this dissertation. First, the calculation of <b>gross</b> electrical <b>power</b> of each production well; and second, the calculation of <b>gross</b> electrical <b>power</b> that can be generated by the combined flow rates of the steam from the production wells. All calculations are performed for a range of separator temperatures and sink temperatures, using multiplies of 5 oC. Mass flow rate of the geothermal fluid of each production well is not provided; accordingly, only the specific <b>gross</b> electrical <b>power</b> (kW/(kg/s)) of each well can be calculated. From the calculation, it is found that the steam produced by LHD- 18 has the lowest specific <b>gross</b> electrical <b>power</b> i. e. 26. 12 kW/(kg/s), which is produced at reservoir temperature of 171. 4 oC and sink temperature of 60 oC. The highest specific <b>gross</b> electrical <b>power,</b> 128. 56 kW/(kg/s), is produced by LHD- 17 at reservoir temperature of 286. 5 oC and sink temperature of 45 oC. The specific <b>gross</b> electrical <b>power</b> depends on the reservoir temperature (wellhead temperature), separator temperature, and sink temperature. Based on the data of daily average of total mass flow rate in June 2008, in normal condition, the steam supplied to power plant Unit 1 is almost equal to Unit 2 that is around 143 to 146 tonnes/hour. This flow rate enables each power plant to generate electricity from 14. 13 MW to 21. 33 MW. Equipment failures will significantly reduce electricity production...|$|R
