Milled chrysotile with 99. 8 % fibers than 5 Mm in length are carcinogenic in our experience. The carcinogenicity of glass fibers in our experiments may have significance for occupational situations. The starting point of our investigations was the question whether the tumorigenic effect of asbestos fibers depends on physicochemical properties of the fiber or the shape of the fibers which are characteristic for all kinds of asbestos. For this purpose chemically different fibrous forms were compared to chemically similar dusts having different forms. Dusts Tested Tables 1 and 2 list the dusts tested in the animal experiments with respect to their chemical composition, particle shape, fiber length, and particle size. The fiber length and particle size were estimated by evaluation of electron micrographs. Experimental Methods The dusts were injected intraperitoneally in Wistar rats.

40|$|To set {{occupational}} exposure limits (OELs) for aerosol particles, dusts, or chemicals, {{one has to}} evaluate whether mechanistic considerations permit identification of a no observed effect level (NOEL). In the case of carcinogenic effects, this can be assumed if no genotoxicity is involved, and exposure is considered safe {{if it does not}} exceed the NOEL. If tumor induction is associated with genotoxicity, any exposure is considered to be of risk, although a NOEL may be identified in the animal or human exposure studies. This must also be assumed when no information on the carcinogenic mechanism, including genotoxicity, is available. Aerosol particles, especially <b>fibrous</b> <b>dusts,</b> which include man-made mineral fiber(s) (MMMF), present a challenge for toxicological evaluation. Many MMMF that have been investigated have induced tumors in animals and genotoxicity in vitro. Since these effects have been associated with long-thin fiber geometry and high durability in vivo, all fibers meeting such criteria are considered carcinogenic unless the opposite has been demonstrated. This approach is practicable. Investigations on fiber tumorigenicity/genotoxicity should include information on dose response, pathobiochemistry, particle clearance, and persistence of the material in the target organ. Such information will introduce quantitative aspects into the qualitative approach that has so far been used to classify <b>fibrous</b> <b>dusts</b> as carcinogens. The rationales for classifying the potential carcinogenicity of MMMF and for setting OELs used by the different European committees and regulatory agencies are described.

Exposure to asbestos and basalt fibers led, in phase II, to impairment of the phagocytic activity of granulocytes. Asbestos fibers also significantly decreased phagocytic activity of monocytes.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} {{of a highly}} carcinogenic potassium octatitanate fibre (Fybex) have been investigated. This material caused {{a low level of}} in vitro transformation in C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells and is thus more active in this assay than the UICC amphibole asbestos samples but less active than fibrous erionite. This ranking is in accord with carcinogenicity in vivo. However Fybex had no detectable activity in an assay for DNA damage based on the S 1 -nuclease sensitivity of the DNA from exposed cells. In that assay crocidolite asbestos was more active than either of the more carcinogenic dusts. It is suggested that the activities of amphibole asbestos in assays for genetic toxicity may depend on the production of free radicals via a catalytic reaction requiring the presence of transition elements which are either not present or only present at low concentrations in erionite or Fybex. This type of reaction may not be related to in vivo carcinogenicity.

40|$|The {{use of the}} V 79 - 4 {{system as}} a primary screen for fiber {{carcinogenicity}} {{is dependent on the}} observed correlation between cytotoxicity of the test material in the system and mesothelioma following intrapleural injection in animals. This correlation has been established for relatively pure samples of fibrous minerals.

This anomalous dose response may aid in the identification of some false positive results but the variety of responses to nonfibrous minerals places a limit on the predictive value of the test mixtures.

40|$|The main {{pathological}} effects {{attributed to}} asbestos are carcinogenesis and fibrogenesis. Statistical {{studies have shown}} that asbestos workers may expect a higher morbidity not only from cancer of the lung and mesothelioma but also from cancer at other sites. Carcinomas have been reported in animals following the injection of asbestos, but the production of carcinomas by inhaled asbestos is less easy to demonstrate; most examples of experimental carcinogenesis with asbestos have been produced in rats. Rats and man react differently to asbestos in that rats do not produce asbestos bodies. The fibrosis that follows inhalation of asbestos has been frequently described, but studies with specific pathogen free animals have shown that, like the fibrosis that may follow the inhalation of silica dust, gross fibrosis involving the production of abnormal amount of collagen probably requires the intervention of infection as well as asbestos. Because of the difficulties encountered in the direct investigation of carcinogenesis and fibrogenesis resulting from the inhalation of asbestos, attention has been directed to the mechanisms by which the lung is able to protect itself against these <b>fibrous</b> <b>dusts.</b> While nonfibrous dusts and short fibers can be ingested by macrophages and removed via the bronchus...|$|R

40|$|Fiber {{length and}} {{persistence}} {{are thought to}} be determinants for the development of toxic, fibrogenic, and carcinogenic effects of <b>fibrous</b> <b>dusts.</b> When the solubilities of chrysotile asbestos (CA) and basalt fibers (BF) were compared by measuring the loss of silica and magnesium in Leineweber's solution, CA was shown to be the more soluble. In a 6 -month inhalation experiment, chrysotile at a mean concentration of 25 mg/m 3 had a higher clearance rate than other comparable dusts. In acute toxicity studies, chrysotile and basalt fibers were administered intraperitoneally. At a dose of 1. 7 g/kg body weight of CA, one third of the animals died. A dose of 2. 7 g/kg body weight killed all the animals. With BF, even at a dose of 10 g/kg body weight all the animals survived. When the two fibers were administered over a 6 -month period, either intratracheally or by inhalation, fibrotic lesions were more common in the group that received CA. Intraperitoneal administration of CA led to three times as many deaths from peritoneal mesothelioma as administration of BF. It appears, therefore, that in spite of its higher solubility and lower persistence, CA was the more toxic, fibrogenic, and carcinogenic fiber, which gives rise to the hypothesis that the surface chemistry of the fibers is the determinant for biological activity.

40|$|The mode {{of action}} of {{inorganic}} fibers as carcinogens is unknown. There is conflicting evidence whether they act by inducing lesions in DNA, such as initiating carcinogens, or alternatively act as promoters of carcinogenesis. Recent evidence has suggested that promoters inhibit the process of cell-to-cell chemical communication known as metabolic cooperation. Chinese hamster V 79 - 4 cells in culture exhibit metabolic cooperation which can be blocked by the promoter tetraphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA). Three kinds of mineral dust were tested {{to determine whether or}} not they could interfere with the intercellular communication.

The results demonstrated that metabolic cooperation between V 79 - 4 cells cannot be reduced by carcinogenic asbestos fibers or by relatively large numbers of nontoxic dust particles.

The differences in performance could be explained by the superior resolving power of the TP-OI method for fine crocidolite fibres. Exposures of airborne asbestos fibres in the spinning area were found to be equivalent to about 20 fml~ ' for personal samples and lOfml" ' for area samples, but due to the high levels of ventilation on the day the samples were collected, the average levels throughout the year may have been somewhat higher.

Inorganic fibers ini sputum were counted by light microscopy after chemical digestion and microfiltration processing. The same method was used for processing gastric juice and lung tissue. There were no ferruginous bodies (FB) in sputum from 49 patients without any asbestos exposure. The study of sputum from 125 patoients with various asbestos exposure pointed out a high correlation between the number of FB in sputum and the level of asbestos exposure. These 125 patients were classified into three groups according to the type of their asbestos occupational hazard: group I, raw asbestos workers; group II, workers manufacturing asbestos products; group III, workers with mixed indlustrial dust exposure. For these three groups, the mean number of FB in sputum was 100, 10, and 1, respectively. The comparison of the FB content of sputum and lung parenchyma showed the absence of FB in sputum when the concentration of FB in lung parenchyma was under 1000 /cm 3 of lung parenchyma; above this concentration the number of FB in sputum was in good correlation with fiber concentration in lung parenchyma.
