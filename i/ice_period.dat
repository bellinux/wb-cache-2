5000|$|A {{synopsis}} of Ukraine's faunal and flora history was noted in Stephen Rudnicki's Ukraine, the Land and Its People: An Introduction to Its Geography (1912): [...] "Ukraine {{has a much}} more varied plant and animal geography than the proper Russian territory, despite the latter's much greater extent. In Ukraine, the borders of three main divisions of plant-geography of Europe meet—the Mediterranean division, the steppe region, and the forest region, with their transition regions. Besides, we meet in Ukraine three mountain regions—the Carpathian, the Crimean, and the Caucasian. In respect to flora, Ukraine possesses only a few endemic species. To be sure the great <b>ice</b> <b>period</b> covered only comparatively small areas of Ukraine with its glacier, but the polar flora undoubtedly prevailed {{in the entire country}} at that time. After the withdrawal of the glacier, steppes first appeared in its place, which then, especially in the Northwest, were forced to make room for a forest flora that had immigrated from Central Europe and Siberia. Hence, despite the considerable area of Ukraine, so few endemic species. Since those primeval days, only a very few natural changes have occurred in the vegetation of Ukraine. However, man, through his cultural activity, has wrought many changes in the plant-world of the country." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{mountain}} mass of Kasaan Peninsula exhibits characteristic glaciated topography. That {{the entire}} peninsula {{was at one}} time overridden by ice streams {{is evident from the}} glacial erratics which lie on the highest summits, the moraine deposits which occur on the lower levels, and the many basins which stand at various elevations on the mountain slopes and are now occupied by lakes. During the period in which this area lay beneath the ice many of the minor topographic features, such as the earlier erosion level, were partly destroyed. Some of the valleys were more deeply eroded, lake basins were formed, and wide areas of glacial silt and debris were laid down. This section of the ice stream is well represented in the northern extension of the valley of Kasaan Bay, which is occupied by a chain of connecting lakes, on the sides of which thick beds of glacial clay and debris have been exposed by subsequent stream erosion. This valley probably represents a preglacial river floor, and only the lake basins and minor physiographic features can be attributed to ice erosion. Erosive action subsequent to the <b>ice</b> <b>period</b> has formed the gulches and ravines which are everywhere prominent on the mountain slopes. Another noteworthy feature of Kasaan Peninsula is its precipitous southwest slope, which is much steeper than that on the northeast. This difference {{may be due to the}} fact that the ice stream remained longer in the valley of Kasaan Bay than in that of Clarence Strait, the action of the ice tending to deepen the valley and at the same time to protect the mountain slopes from surface erosion.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to assess the effect of an unusual 10 -day snow and <b>ice</b> <b>period</b> on the prevalence of fractures in an emergency department (ED) in the Netherlands. Furthermore, patients with fractures during the snow and <b>ice</b> <b>period</b> were compared to those in the control period with respect to gender, age, location of accident, length of stay, disposition, and anatomical site of the injury. Methods: Fracture prevalence during a 10 -day study period with snow and ice (January 14, 2013 until January 23, 2013) was compared to a similar 10 -day control period without snow or ice (January 16, 2012 until January 25, 2012). The records of all patients with a fracture were manually selected. Besides this, basic demographics, type of fracture, and location of the accident (inside or outside) were compared. Results: A total of 1, 785 patients visited the ED during the study period and 1, 974 during the control period. A fracture was found in 224 patients during the study period and in 109 patients during the control period (P < 0. 01). More fractures sustained outside account for this difference. No differences were found in gender, mean age, and length of ED stay. However, during the snow and <b>ice</b> <b>period</b> the percentage of fractures in the middle-aged (31 - 60 yrs) was significantly higher than in the control period (P < 0. 01). Conclusions: The number of fractures sustained more than doubled during a period with snow and ice as compared to the control period.

40|$|Arctic sea ice {{plays an}} {{important}} role in climate by influencing surface heat fluxes and albedo, so must be accurately represented in climate models. This study finds that the fully coupled ice-ocean-atmosphere-land Community Climate System Model (CCSM 3. 0) underestimates day-to-day ice variability compared to observations and employs the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM 3. 0) to investigate the atmospheric sensitivity to sea ice variability. Three 100 -ensemble experiments are forced with climatological, daily-varying, and smoothly-varying sea ice conditions from an anomalously low <b>ice</b> <b>period</b> (September 2006 -February 2007). Daily ice variability has a large local impact on the atmosphere when ice undergoes rapid changes, leading to local cooling and subsequent circulation changes.

The vents were investigated aerodynamically to obtain vent-tube pressures and pressure distributions on the ramp surface as functions of tunnel-air velocity and angle of attack. Icing investigations were made to determine the vent-tube pressure losses for several icing conditions at tunnel-air velocities ranging from 220 to 440 feet per second. In general, under nonicing conditions, the configurations with diverging ramp walls maintained, vent-tube pressures greater than the required marginal value of 2 inches of water positive pressure differential between the fuel cell and the compartment containing the fuel cell {{for a range of}} angles of attack from 0 to 14 deg at a tunnel-air velocity of approximately 240 feet per second. A configuration haying divergIng ramp sldewalls, a 7 deg ramp angle; and vent tubes manifold,ed to a common plenum chamber opening through a slot In the ramp floor gave the greatest vent-tube pressures for all the configurations investigated. The use of the plenum chamber resulted in uniform pressures in all vent tubes. In a cloud-icing condition, roughness caused by ice formations on the airfoil surface ahead of the vent ramp, rather than icing of the vent configuration, caused a rapid loss in vent-tube pressures during the first few minutes of an <b>icing</b> <b>period.</b> Only the configuration having diverging ramp sidewalls, a 7 ramp angle, and a common plenum chamber maintained the required vent-tube pressures throughout a 60 -minute <b>icing</b> <b>period,</b> although the <b>ice</b> formations on this configuration were more severe than those observed for the other configurations.

Seedlings of winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) {{do not show}} such a response in similar experimental conditions. During ice encasement, there are general declines in adenylate energy charge (AEC), total adenylates and ATP:ADP ratios in the crown tissues of two winter wheat cultivars, and a winter barley, but rates of decline are faster in the barley. When the <b>ice</b> <b>period</b> is preceded by low temperature flooding of the whole plant, levels of the adenylate components are raised significantly in the wheats, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the barley. The survival of plants in ice preceded by flooding is related to the increased initial level of adenylates at the onset of the ice encasement stress, and the maintenance of higher levels of adenylates and ATP in the early stages of ice encasement as a result of accelerated rates of glycolysis. Higher survival of both winter wheat and barley plants during ice encasement in the light is also associated with significantly higher levels of AEC and adenylates in the early stages of ice encasement...|$|E

The daily sea ice concentration tendency in five Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP 5) simulations is compared with observations to reveal that many models underestimate this quantity that describes high-frequency ice movements, particularly in the marginal ice zone. To investigate whether high-frequency ice variability impacts the atmosphere, the Community Atmosphere Model, version 3. 0 (CAM 3. 0), is forced by sea ice with and without daily fluctuations. Two 100 -member ensemble experiments with daily varying (DAILY) and smoothly varying (SMTH) sea ice are conducted, along with a climatological control, for an anoma- lously low <b>ice</b> <b>period</b> (August 2006 –November 2007). Results are presented for three periods: September 2006, October 2006, and December–February (DJF) 2006 / 07. The atmospheric response differs between DAILY and SMTH. In September, sea ice differences lead to an anomalous high and weaker storm activity over northern Europe. During October, the ice expands equatorward faster in DAILY than SMTH in the Siberian seas and leads to a local response of near-surface cooling. In DJF, there is a 1. 5 -hPa positive sea level pressure anomaly over North America, leading to anomalous northerly flow and anomalously cool continental U. S. temperatures. While the atmospheric responses are modest, the differences arising from high temporal frequency ice variability cannot be ignored. Increasing the accuracy of coupled model sea ice variations on short time scales is needed to improve short-term coupled model forecasts...|$|E
40|$|It was in {{the late}} eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries that {{scientific}} interest in glaciers began to grow. Following the discovery of their movement, the well-known Louis Agassiz published a paper citing evidence collected by other scientists that glaciers in Europe had once been more extensive and suggesting a “great <b>ice</b> <b>period,</b> ” which sparked a flurry of research [Guyton, 1998]. This new idea of an Ice Age evolved into the concept of Ice Ages as regular occurrences [Guyton, 1998]. The timing of these has been found to correlate well, but not perfectly, with three astronomical cycles involving the orbit and rotational axis of the Earth, indicating that these largely dictate climate change leading to formation and disappearance of glaciers, probably with influence also from variance in levels of solar activity and from geologic events [Guyton, 1998]. Glaciers form when snowfall exceeds snowmelt {{over a long period of}} time, allowing old snow to be gradually compacted into ice [Hill, 2006]. They may be categorized by the temperature of their ice or by whether they are confined to mountain valleys or unconfined [Guyton, 1998]. Contemporary glaciers in California are warm and confined, and it is believed that all those of the Pleistocene epoch were also [Guyton, 1998]. In the Sierra Nevada, Pleistocene glaciers carved deep U-shaped valleys, sharpened peak and ridges, and deposited mounds of till. In order to piece together a picture of what glacial events happened and when, scientists observe and interpret these features and date till and lake-sediment samples. The continued study of glaciers is important in monitoring the effects of climate change...|$|E

It is established that there is a tendency for a decrease in ice cover by 2. 5 % in Aniva Bay, and in La Perouse Strait – by 11 % for the period from 1979 to 2016. It is revealed that Aniva Bay is the only water area with a tendency of increasing ice cover. Based on the analysis of the dynamics of ice cover anomalies relative to the climatic standard norm of 1981 - 2010, periods with the predominance of its positive and negative values and years with the highest and lowest values have been marked. It is shown that the ice cover of La Perouse Strait and Aniva Bay has the greatest interrelation with the ice cover in the extreme southern part of the Sea of Okhotsk with a correlation coefficient of 0. 76 and 0. 66, respectively. The typing of winters according to the severity of ice conditions has been performed according to which it is determined that the sum of severe and extremely severe types of winters in Aniva Bay is higher than that in La Perouse Strait.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014. Marine {{production}} {{across the}} Bering-Chukchi continental shelf {{is influenced by}} seasonal sea ice dynamics and climatic conditions. Of particular importance is variability in the magnitude and timing of annual phytoplankton production {{in the water column}} and in sea ice, and effects of such variability on food web composition and productivity. Of primary concern is the long-term effect of the projected loss of Arctic sea ice on ecosystem productivity and stability, and the fate of upper trophic level species. I examined a portion of the Bering-Chukchi Sea food web by analyzing the fatty acid composition and stable carbon isotope ratios of individual fatty acids in particulate organic matter from sea ice and the water column. These techniques were used to make inferences about diets of three species of zooplankton (Themisto libellula, Calanus marshallae/glacialis, Thysanoessa raschii) sampled during a recent climatically cold, relatively heavy sea <b>ice</b> <b>period</b> in the Bering Sea. I also analyzed fatty acids of four species of ice-associated seals [...] ringed (Pusa/Phoca hispida), bearded (Erignathus barbatus), spotted (Phoca largha), and ribbon seals (Histriophoca fasciata) [...] sampled during the same relatively cold period (2007 - 2010) as well as a preceding warm (2002 - 2005), relatively low sea <b>ice</b> <b>period</b> in the Bering Sea. Particulate organic matter from sea ice and the water column had different fatty acid characteristics, most likely stemming from differences in algal composition. My results also showed that in the Bering Sea cold period, the amphipod T. libellula was predominately carnivorous, and the copepod C. marshallae/glacialis and euphausiid T. raschii were primarily herbivorous, but displayed some degree of omnivory. Across all years (2002 - 2010), fatty acid composition of ice seals showed clear evidence of resource partitioning among them, and little niche separation between spotted and ribbon seals, which is consistent with previous studies. The fatty acid composition of primarily pelagic feeding adult ringed seals and predominantly benthic feeding adult bearded seals did not differ between the recent warm (2002 - 2005) and cold (2007 - 2010) periods in the Bering Sea, suggesting that their diets and possibly food web structures were not affected by these large multiyear environmental fluctuations. Notably however, the stable carbon isotope ratios of individual fatty acids of bearded seals from the Bering Sea cold period were higher than those from the warm period, which suggests that their prey base in the Bering Sea was receiving more input from particulate organic matter from sea ice than the water column during those years. By using the stable carbon isotope ratios of individual fatty acids of particulate organic matter from sea ice and the water column in a series of stable isotope mixing models, I estimated the proportional contribution of fatty acids from sea ice particulate organic matter in T. libellula, C. marshallae/glacialis, and T. raschii collected in 2009 and 2010 as 36 - 72 %, 27 - 63 %, and 39 - 71 %, respectively. Using a similar set of mixing models, I estimated that adult bearded seals had the highest level of fatty acids from sea ice particulate organic matter (62 - 80 %), followed by spotted seals (51 - 62 %), and then ringed seals (21 - 60 %) in 2009 and 2010. Although estimates could not be made for ribbon seals due to lack of samples in 2009 and 2010, their stable carbon isotope ratios of individual fatty acids from 2003 were very similar to those of spotted seals suggesting that the proportional contribution of fatty acids from sea ice particulate organic matter to ribbons seals was similar to that of spotted seals. Assuming that seals sourced their sympagic fatty acids from the Bering Sea, these results suggest that sympagic production is currently an important contributor to food webs supporting both benthic and pelagic upper trophic level species in years with heavy ice cover in the Bering Sea. Thus, the question is raised [...] with the projected continuing loss of seasonal sea ice in the Arctic, will organic matter input from sympagic production also decline, and will it be compensated for by pelagic production to balance both pelagic and benthic carbon and energy budgets...|$|E

The studies are based on a series of modelling applications, field data collections and data analysis. First a process based one dimensional river ice model Mike-Ice has been established in a shallow and fast flowing river. The analysis has been carried out in a basin with a complex hydropower system consisting of multiple reservoirs, hydropower plants and secondary intakes. The result suggests that the Mike-Ice model is a useful tool for the simulations of general hydropower impacts on river ice conditions. The study further investigates the use of the calibrated model to examine climate change impacts on river ice in detail. Climate change impacts have been investigated on rivers and reservoirs in general at a regional scale. In the future, climate change impacts on ice have both positive and negative implication for hydropower operations. The reduction of ice loads on hydropower structures and shortened <b>ice</b> <b>period</b> in the future climate are the positive consequences. However, the unstable winters with possibility of frequent freeze-thaw periods can be problematic in future climate. The detailed simulations of climate change impacts on ice conditions show that there will probably be fewer frazil ice days, shortened ice cover periods and warmer water temperature at most of the locations in Orkla river by the middle and end of the 21 th century. The winter hydropower operational constraints given in the regulation permit in the Orkla basin have been investigated by using a series of numerical modelling tools. This {{is focused on}} the lowermost power plant intake at Svorkmo and the outlets from Grana and Brattset upstream which provides the inflow for Svorkmo. The permit states that the upstream plants should be stopped {{in the case of a}} shutdown of Svorkmo to prevent ice problems in the downstream bypass reach. The study found it very likely that the effect of this is small since water already released upstream will spill and break the ice. Further, stopping the upstream plants might introduce environmental and ice problems upstream of Svorkmo. The study concludes that the hydropower operational strategies can be improved by using the recently available modelling tools for finding a balanced operation of the hydropower system in relation to ice problems and the environment. A field based freeze-up study has been carried out in the anchor ice dominated river Sokna. The observation shows that ice formation and a freeze-up process are very complicated and have a highly spatio-temporal variability.   Big emergent boulders and turbulent water are the locations for the formation of the dominant anchor ice dams controlling ice formation in the reach. A significant water level rise along the study reach caused by the ice formation has been observed that altered the ice free shape of the water surface. A consequence of this is a meandering flow path driven by the ice formation that moved the main flow from one bank to another and further added to the complexity of the ice surface. The finding and the data collected in the study will be useful for future development of anchor ice modelling tools, as modelling of anchor ice and anchor ice dams is still a challenge in river ice modelling.
