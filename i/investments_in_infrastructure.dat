This is a result of huge <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and culture as well as the work of successful new Danish architects, designers and chefs. Copenhagen Fashion Week, the largest fashion event in Northern Europe, takes place every year in February and August.|$|E

25|$|Landfills {{are often}} the most {{cost-efficient}} way to dispose of waste, especially in countries like the United States with large open spaces. While resource recovery and incineration both require extensive <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> and material recovery also requires extensive manpower to maintain, landfills have fewer fixed—or ongoing—costs, allowing them to compete favorably. In addition, landfill gas can be upgraded to natural gas—landfill gas utilization—which is a potential revenue stream. Another advantage is having a specific location for disposal that can be monitored, where waste can be processed to remove all recyclable materials before tipping.|$|E
25|$|All public {{transport}} runs on infrastructure, either on roads, rail, airways or seaways. The infrastructure {{can be shared}} with other modes, freight and private transport, {{or it can be}} dedicated to {{public transport}}. The latter is especially valuable in cases where there are capacity problems for private transport. <b>Investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>infrastructure</b> are expensive and make up a substantial part of the total costs in systems that are new or expanding. Once built, the infrastructure will require operating and maintenance costs, adding to the total cost of public transport. Sometimes governments subsidize infrastructure by providing it free of charge, just as is common with roads for automobiles.|$|E

With {{the help of the}} Cemaat Movement led by preacher Fethullah Gülen, Erdoğan was able to curb the power of the military through the Sledgehammer and Ergenekon court cases. In late 2012, his government began peace negotiations with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) to end the ongoing PKK insurgency that began in 1978. The ceasefire broke down in 2015, leading to a renewed escalation in conflict. In 2016, a coup d'état was unsuccessfully attempted against Erdoğan and Turkish state institutions. This was followed by purges and an ongoing state of emergency.|$|E

40|$|Keywords: {{infrastructure}} investment, construction industry, {{developing countries}} Many countries have initiated national programmes, research programmes or {{other activities that}} support {{the development of the}} construction industry. This paper reviews various of these national initiatives, and highlights that the initiatives in the developed countries are largely “supply-side ” initiatives. The paper argues that while developing countries can benefit from the experience gained from these initiatives, they may not necessarily have the most appropriate focus for developing countries. In particular, developing countries should also include a focus on “demand-side ” initiatives – including initiatives that promote <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> The paper then examines barriers and incentives to <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> and concludes with recommendations on initiatives that could be adopted in developing countries to promote <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Construction industry development can be defined (CIDB, 2002) as the deliberate and manage...|$|R
2500|$|By the Norman conquest, London had {{overtaken}} Winchester as {{the largest}} city in England, {{due in part to}} Alfred the Great's <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> and after the Norman Conquest, King William I made it his capital. The centre of political power moved away from Hampshire, although Winchester remained a city of importance: the proximity of the New Forest to Winchester [...] made it such a prized royal hunting forest; indeed King William Rufus was famously killed in suspicious circumstances while hunting there. The county was recorded in the Domesday Book divided into 44 hundreds. From the 12th century, the ports grew in importance, fuelled by trade with the continent, wool and cloth manufacture in the county, and the fishing industry, and a shipbuilding industry was established. By 1523 at the latest, the population of Southampton had outstripped that of Winchester.|$|E
2500|$|The Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway was {{acquired}} and reorganized in 1926 by Dr. Thomas Conway, Jr., {{a professor of}} business at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Believing that he could turn the interurban into a very profitable operation, he made substantial <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and rolling stock, including passenger cars and freight locomotives. He spent $500,000 to purchase the CH and then spent $1.5 million on improvements. The interurban's business and prospects improved as hoped, particularly in the movement of freight. In 1929, it handled [...] of freight in Cincinnati. Conway then contemplated the advantages of extending his railway north to Toledo, Ohio [...] connecting to Detroit where the C could tap the shipping business of the automotive industry. Thus Conway acquired the Indiana, Columbus and Eastern and the Lima-Toledo as the two teetered {{at the edge of}} bankruptcy. These acquisitions gave him the desired access to Toledo. [...] In early January, 1930, the three combined lines were officially incorporated as the Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad.|$|E
