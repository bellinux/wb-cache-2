5|$|The {{building}} had {{stained glass windows}} and the <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> decorated with glazed bricks, similar to other public buildings of this era in the city, such as the Victoria Baths. The similarities suggest the influence and adoption of a standard design by Henry Price's newly created City Architect's Department.|$|E
5|$|The building's attic {{was damaged}} {{in a fire}} in 1913. An {{additional}} storey was constructed in 1935 under the engineer Todor Tonev, turning the headquarters into a three-storey edifice. The trademark clock was added in the late 19th century. In 1964–1967, the building's <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> refurbished so it could accommodate the City People's Council. Today, it houses the administration of Ruse's Chamber of Control.|$|E
40|$|How can {{cultural}} memory values {{be preserved}} when an <b>interior</b> <b>is</b> transformed for new use?

5|$|The <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> to {{have been}} a riot of Burgesian excess but not a single room was {{completed}} to Burges's designs.

5|$|After {{meeting with}} Caine and Forte, White {{was taken to}} the grill {{restaurant}} at the Hyde Park Hotel. Forte was interested if White could transfer the Michelin stars from Harveys; White was open to this since Raymond Blanc had previously transferred two stars to Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons when he moved his restaurant from Summertown, Oxford. Following the agreement of Michelin, White left Harveys in July 1993; The Restaurant was opened at the Hyde Park Hotel less than two months later, on 14 September.

5|$|Essad Pasha Toptani, as {{minister}} {{of war and}} <b>interior,</b> <b>was</b> against a peaceful solution of the problem. He opposed the International Commission of Control which believed that the problem could be solved by diplomatic means. The Prince and his cabinet accepted Essad Pasha's proposals for a military solution. Several thousand Italian rifles and Austrian machine and mountain guns were purchased and distributed to the (predominantly Muslim) population of central Albania. They believed that the new regime was a tool of the (Christian) Great Powers and the landowners that owned half of the arable land. On the basis of those beliefs they revolted.|$|E
5|$|From the exterior, the {{building}} appears austere, as was much of Mountfort's early work: a central tower dominates two flanking gabled wings in the Gothic revival style. However the <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> {{a riot of}} colour and medievalism as perceived through Victorian eyes; it included stained glass windows, and a large double-faced clock, thought {{to be one of}} only five around the globe. The chamber is decorated in a rich, almost Ruskinesque style, with carvings by a local sculptor William Brassington. Included in the carvings are representations of indigenous New Zealand species.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} design and decoration, Mavrodinov likens the church to the Church of St Pantaleon in Gorno Nerezi near Skopje, today in the Republic of Macedonia. It is also {{compared}} to the Church of St Theodore in nearby Boboshevo. The Church of St Nicholas features a multitude of two-stepped vaults on its outside walls. The <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> originally entirely covered with frescoes, though only fragments survive. It was enlisted as a monument of culture of national importance in 1968, with a publication in Bulgaria's newspaper of record, the State Gazette, issue 77.|$|E
5|$|In the St. Joseph the Worker Chapel, Victorias, in the Philippines, Raymond {{worked with}} liturgical artist Ade Bethune, to produce mosaic murals and a lacquerware {{tabernacle}} inside the reinforced concrete church.

5|$|Initially, as {{in some of}} the {{continental}} cathedrals, the <b>interior</b> <b>was</b> decorated with designs emphasizing the arch ribs and portal components.

Traces of these have been found in the chancel and in the chapel which was originally dedicated to St Eric and St Olaf. Unfortunately, they have now been heavily restored. The frescos in the chancel were probably painted by Albertus Pictor's workshop.|$|E

5|$|The Church of St John the Baptist {{belonged to}} the {{northern}} fortifications of medieval Asenovgrad (then known in Greek as Stenimachos). It was in continuous operation until the late 18th or early 19th century, when it suffered significant damage, perhaps during Ottoman brigand raids.
