5000|$|In theory, the Roman Empire was not {{divided by}} the dual imperium. Though {{divisions}} did take place - each emperor had his own court, army, and official residences - these were matters of practicality, not substance. Imperial propaganda from 287 on insists on a singular and indivisible Rome, a patrimonium <b>indivisum.</b> As the panegyrist of 289 declares to Maximian: [...] "So it is that this great empire is a communal possession for both of you, without any discord, nor would we endure there to be any dispute between you, but plainly you hold the state in equal measure as once those two Heracleidae, the Spartan Kings, had done." [...] Legal rulings were given and imperial celebrations took place in both emperors' names, and the same coins were issued in both parts of the empire. Diocletian sometimes issued commands to Maximian's province of Africa; Maximian could presumably {{have done the same}} for Diocletian's territory.|$|E

Aptosimum procumbens (Scrophulariaceae) and Garuleum bipinnatum (Asteraceae) are two indigenous South African plants {{that have been used}} as traditional remedies. Phytochemical investigations were performed with the aim of isolating and identifying compounds that may be responsible for the recorded medicinal properties of these plants. Various chromatographic techniques were utilized for the separation of the plant extract constituents. Several terpenoid compounds were isolated from both plants and the flavanone was isolated from A. procumbens. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy including 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, COSY, DEPT, HMQC, HSCQ, HMBC and NOESY experiments were performed to allow for structure determination, the results of which will be discussed. The iridoid glycosides angeloside, shanzhiside methyl ester, barlerin, a new compound foliamethoylshanzhiside methyl ester and the flavanone pinocembrin neohesperidoside were identified as constituents of A. procumbens. Fractionation of the G. bipinnatum extract afforded several sandaracopimar- 15 -ene diterpenoid derivatives, namely sandaracopimar- 15 -ene- 8 ƒÒ-ol, sandaracopimar- 15 -ene- 8 ƒÒ, 11 ƒÑ-diol, 12 -O-acetylsandaracopimar- 15 -ene- 8 ƒÒ, 11 ƒÑ, 12 ƒÒƒn-triol, 11 -O-acetylsandara-copimar- 15 -ene- 8 ƒÒ, 11 ƒÑ, 12 ƒÒƒn-triol, 11 -O- feruoylsandaracopimar- 15 -ene- 8 ƒÒ, 11 ƒÑƒz 12 ƒÒ-triol and 11 -O-p-coumaroylsandaracopimar- 15 -ene- 8, 11 ƒÑ, 12 ƒÒ-triol. Diterpenoids are known to possess antimicrobial properties enabling them to fight off various infections and monoterpenoid iridoid glycosides generally have anti-inflammatory properties that make them wound-healing agents. Flavonoids are a diverse group of compounds with enormous structural variations and have a wide range of medicinal properties. A general review on the structural classification, biosynthesis and biological activity of these secondary metabolites is given in this dissertation. Iridoids are commonly found in plants belonging to the Scrophulariaceae family and shanzhiside methyl ester has also been isolated from A. <b>indivisum,</b> a related Aptosimum species. Many plants from the Scrophulariaceae family have been used as traditional medicine to treat wounds. The crude extract of the plant tested positive for antitumor activity against three cell lines, namely melanoma, breast and renal. G. bippinatum belongs to one of the largest plant families, Asteraceae and the crude extract exhibited antimicrobial activity against several microorganisms. Prof. F. R. van Heerde...|$|E
