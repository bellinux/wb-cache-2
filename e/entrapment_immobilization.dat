Through ring-opening polymerization and nucleophilic substitution, poly[bis(methacrylate) phosphazene] (PBMAP) was successfully synthesized from hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene. By adding PBMAP to methacrylic acid solution and then treating with UV light, we could obtain a cross-linked polyphosphazene network, which showed an ultra-high absorbency for distilled water.

40|$|An {{immobilization}} method {{based on}} the spontaneous adhesion of invertase-active cells of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to tuff granules was described by Parascandola, Scardi, and Tartaglione. Compared with gel <b>entrapment,</b> <b>immobilization</b> by adhesion is much more simple and free from diffusional limitations. However, adhesion is a rather complicated process involving surface interactions between microbial cells and the so-called substratum, that is, the solid support to which they attach. Because {{there are still many}} unanswered questions about the mechanism of adhesion, the selection of suitable substrata for a given microbial species can be made only empirically. Thus, to find substrata better than tuff or insolubilized gelatin, polymeric hydrogels that were obtained by radiation-induced polymerization below 0 °C and that were employed successfully for immobilizing enzymes, cells and antibodies were considered. A dozen of such polymer matrices with different hydrophilicities were synthesized and assayed as possible substrata for S. cereviisae cells used in continuous ethanol production...|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical immunosensors {{have emerged}} as a highly {{sensitive}} and rapid technique {{for the detection of}} specific pesticide based on the immunological interactions between the binding biomolecules (antibody or hapten) onto the transducer interface and the target analyte (hapten or antibody). In terms of the development of electrochemical immunosensors, the antibody (Ab) /hapten immobilization onto a transducer or a support matrice is a crucial step in improving the analytical performance, such as response, reproducibility, stability, selectivity and regeneration. This paper presents an overview of different types of electrochemical immunosensors and their principles and various immobilization protocols used for formation of a biorecognition interface, such as physical adsorption, covalent coupling, <b>entrapment,</b> oriented <b>immobilization,</b> self-assembled monolayer, nanoparticles. In addition, future prospects toward the development of electrochemical immunosensor systems are discussed. ...|$|R

Some aspects of enzymes {{that must be}} improved prior to implementation are stability, activity, inhibition by reaction products, and selectivity towards non-natural substrates.

[...] Immobilization of enzymes greatly simplifies the recovery process, enhances process control, and reduces operational costs. Many immobilization techniques exist, such as adsorption, covalent binding, affinity, and <b>entrapment.</b> Ideal <b>immobilization</b> processes should not use highly toxic reagents in the immobilization technique to ensure stability of the enzymes.

In order to prevent enzyme from leaking out of the gel beads, Ca-alginate beads were then coated with silicate. Enzyme loading efficiency and immobilization yield for silicate coated beads was determined as 98. 1 % and 71. 27 %, respectively and compared with non-coated ones which were 68. 5 % and 45. 80 %, respectively. Surface morphologies, structure and elemental analysis of both silicate coated and non-coated alginate beads were also compared using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Moreover, silicate coated alginate beads enhanced reusability of esterase in continuous processes compared to non-coated beads. The hydrolytic properties of free and immobilized enzyme in terms of storage and thermal stability {{as well as the}} effects of the temperature and pH were determined.

40|$|Selective laser {{sintering}} (SLS), a rapid prototyping technology, was investigated for producing bone tissue engineering scaffolds. Completely biodegradable osteoconductive calcium phosphate (Ca-P) /poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) scaffolds were successfully fabricated via SLS using Ca-P/PHBV nanocomposite microspheres. In the SLS manufacturing route, {{the architecture of}} tissue engineering scaffolds (pore shape, size, interconnectivity, etc.) can be designed and the sintering process can be optimized for obtaining scaffolds with desirable porous structures and mechanical properties. SLS was also shown to be very effective in producing highly complex porous structures using nanocomposite microspheres. To render SLS-formed Ca-P/PHBV scaffolds osteoinductive, recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (rhBMP- 2) could be loaded onto the scaffolds. For achieving a controlled release of rhBMP- 2 from scaffolds, surface modification of Ca-P/PHBV scaffolds by gelatin <b>entrapment</b> and heparin <b>immobilization</b> was needed. The immobilized heparin provided binding affinity for rhBMP- 2. Surface modified Ca-P/PHBV nanocomposite scaffolds loaded with rhBMP- 2 enhanced the proliferation of human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) and also their alkaline phosphatase activity. In in vivo experiments using a rabbit model, surface modified Ca-P/PHBV nanocomposite scaffolds loaded with rhBMP- 2 promoted ectopic bone formation, exhibiting their osteoinductivity. The strategy of combining advanced scaffold fabrication, nanocomposite material, and controlled growth factor delivery is promising for bone tissue regeneration. postprin...|$|R
40|$|Production of chiral amines using omega-transaminases {{has been}} {{thoroughly}} studied in recent years. Immobilized w-transaminases, however, {{have been used}} on relatively few occasions despite potential benefits such as reuse of enzyme and ease of product purification. In this study principally different methods including surface <b>immobilization,</b> <b>entrapment</b> and sweep flocculation using titanium oxide. Ca-alginate and chitosan respectively were evaluated for the immobilization of recombinant Escherichia coil cells. The enzyme expressed was a modified Arthrobacter citreus omega-transaminase with improved thermostability. The preparations were compared in terms of cell loading capacity, operational stability in repeated batches and storage stability using the conversion of methylbenzylamine to acetophenone. The use of chitosan for cell immobilization {{proved to be the}} method of choice since it was both very simple and effective. At a very high cell loading of 3. 2 g cells/g chitosan > 60 % activity was observed. The preparation was reused in eight successive 1 -h batches with > 90 % remaining activity. To further demonstrate its usability the preparation was used for asymmetric synthesis of (S) - 4 '-cyano-(alpha) -methylbenzylamine in three repeated bathes (cycle time > 20 h), using isopropylamine as the amine donor. Storage stability was comparable with that of non-immobilized cells. It was concluded that the chitosan method due to its properties and simplicity would be advantageous for use also on a larger scale. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Nanostructured {{systems are}} of {{considerable}} research {{interest in the}} field of enzyme biotechnology. The aim of this thesis is to study and understand the structure-function relationship of hydrolytic enzymes in nanostructured systems, leading to the rational design of novel nanobiocatalytic systems. The study focuses on two types of nanostructured systems: water in ionic liquid microemulsions and carbon-based nanomaterials. Water in ionic liquid microemulsions are novel water-nanodispersion systems which combine the advantages of both microemulsions and ionic liquids (IL). Such microemulsions can be formed using the ionic liquid [bmim]PF 6 and the non-ionic surfactant Tween 20. Lipases entrapped in these IL microemulsions exhibited improved catalytic behaviour compared to other microheterogeneous systems, indicating the positive effect of the organized nanostructures on the catalytic behavior of enzymes. The composition of IL microemulsions affects significantly the catalytic characteristics and the structure of encapsulated lipases. Lipases in IL microemulsions adopt a rigid structure rich in β-sheets, which is responsible for the observed increase in thermostability. At the same time, lipases retain their α-helices, which are associated with their increased catalytic activity. A significant advantage of the use of IL microemulsions is the possibility of reuse of the entrapped enzymes, something that is not feasible in other microheterogeneous systems. Immobilization of lipases which are entrapped in IL microemulsions in gels prepared with (hydroxypropyl) methyl cellulose (HPMC) confers the improved catalytic features that the lipases exhibit in these microemulsions available to various non-conventional media. The immobilized lipase in IL microemulsion-based organogels led to increased synthetic activity, independently of the reaction medium. Moreover, the stability of immobilized lipases is increased compared with that exhibited by non-immobilized enzymes in an aqueous solution (up to 200 times) or IL microemulsions (up to 25 times). The increased stability of lipases in microemulsion-based organogels is due to the adoption of a more rigid structure, {{as in the case of}} IL microemulsions. Functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene oxide derivatives which bear chemical groups (such as carboxyl-, hydroxyl- and amino-groups) or aliphatic chains on their surface were used as immobilization carriers for lipases and esterases. Enzymes can be immobilized onto these nanomaterials with physical adsorption and covalent attachment, producing biomaterials that can be loaded with up to 1. 65 mg enzyme per mg of nanomaterial. The immobilization yield and catalytic activity of enzymes is greatly affected by the geometry and the functional groups of the nanomaterials and the immobilization protocol. The experimental results suggest the functionalized CNTs as more appropriate immobilization carriers than the respective graphene oxide derivatives. Regarding the functional groups on the surface of the nanomaterials, carboxyl-groups seem to be recognized by the active site of hydrolytic enzymes, leading to reduced activity, while further modification of these nanomaterials with hexamethylenediamine have a positive effect on the catalytic activity of enzymes. The synthetic activity of immobilized hydrolases is up to 75 times greater than that of free enzymes. The covalent immobilization of enzymes producing materials with comparable biocatalytic activity to the physical absorption protocol and leads to significant stabilization of enzymes. The enzyme - nanomaterial interactions lead to structural changes of enzymes, particularly during non-covalent immobilization. The presence of nanomaterials in aqueous solution leads to reduction of enzyme’s α-helical content. This reduction has a negative impact on the catalytic activity of esterases and while for lipases it led to activation. This can be related to the interfacial activation of lipases. It seems that organized nanostructures (either microemulsions or nanomaterials) simulate in a better way the natural microenvironment of these enzymes compared with the aqueous solution, resulting in a structure of the enzyme observed in these systems which is closer to the active structure of lipases when they act in nature. These novel nanobiocatalytic systems can be used to develop biocatalytic processes, such as modification of bioactive natural compounds and the production of biodiesel. Conclusively, organized nanostructured systems significantly improve the catalytic activity of hydrolytic enzymes, leading to novel nanobiocatalytic systems with interesting properties. The systems developed in the present study are consistent with the requirements of 'green chemistry', as their structural components exhibit low toxicity and high biocompatibility. The results of this study demonstrate the significant benefits arising from the implementation of organized nanostructures to <b>entrapment</b> and <b>immobilization</b> of hydrolytic enzymes for the development of novel innovative biocatalytic systems, which constitute the basis for the development of numerous applications {{in the field of}} nanobiocatalysis and, in a more wide perspective, in the field of nanobiotechnology. ...|$|R
