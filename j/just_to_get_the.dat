Nevertheless, the general atmosphere of the machine gun company is relaxed and business-like throughout the story. The soldiers' continued disrespect for formalities and discipline is a source of frustration for some of the officers.

25|$|In September 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{pushed to}} revive the stalled peace process by getting the parties involved to agree to direct talks {{for the first time}} in about two years. While U.S. President Barack Obama was the orchestrator of the movement, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went through months of cajoling <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> parties to the table, and helped convince the reluctant Palestinians by getting support for direct talks from Egypt and Jordan. The aim of the talks was to forge the framework of a final agreement within one year, although general expectations of a success were fairly low. The talks aimed to put the Israeli–Palestinian conflict to an official end by forming a two-state solution for the Jewish and Palestinian peoples, promoting the idea of everlasting peace and putting an official halt to any further land claims, as well as accepting the rejection of any forceful retribution if violence should reoccur. Hamas and Hezbollah, however threatened violence, especially if either side seemed likely to compromise in order to reach an agreement. As a result, the Israeli government publicly stated that peace couldn't exist even if both sides signed the agreement, due to the stance taken by Hamas and Hezbollah. The US was therefore compelled to re-focus on eliminating the threat posed by the stance of Hamas and Hezbollah as part of the direct talk progress. Israel for its part, was skeptical that a final agreement was reached that the situation would change, as Hamas and Hezbollah would still get support to fuel new violence. In addition, the Israeli government rejected any possible agreement with Palestine as long as it refuses to recognize Israel as a Jewish state.|$|E

500|$|That We Can Play opening track, [...] "Strawberry Skies", {{the only}} {{cut on the}} release that was {{produced}} in a real studio, {{was inspired by the}} theme of the American television show Law & Order. Critics compared it to Bananarama's [...] "Cruel Summer". The track features dream-like vocals by Laurel Halo, mixed with reverb; according to Fact, it reflects the [...] "cloud-like" [...] sounds of previous releases by Oneohtrix Point Never. In writing the lyrics to the song, Ford and Lopatin came up with several senseless phrases in writing the melody for the lead vocal, the former saying that he [...] "made them about Shaq and Kobe and eating steak sandwiches and pies," [...] and the latter saying [...] "Anything <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> sounds." [...] "Strawberry Skies" [...] is followed by [...] "MIDI Drift", which features an Italo bass line, [...] "pitch-bent keytar" [...] and [...] "square wave synths", and was compared by Michael Brodeur of The Boston Globe to the music of Ratatat.|$|E
500|$|... "Headline News" [...] was {{released}} on September 26, 1994, as the lead-off single for Permanent Record: Al in the Box, which was also released a day later. Yankovic also insisted that the song be commercially available as a CD single so that his fans who are completists {{would not have to}} purchase the expensive box set <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> new song. Much like the cover for the Crash Test Dummies's 1993 studio album God Shuffled His Feet, the cover for Yankovic's single superimposes his faces over the figures of Titian's painting Bacchus and Ariadne. The art direction is credited to Doug Haverty, and design is credit to Daniel Sorenson, David McDougall. The b-side of [...] "Headline News" [...] was a remix of Yankovic's 1986 original song [...] "Christmas at Ground Zero". The song was never officially released on a studio album, although it did appear on Yankovic's Greatest Hits Volume II album, which {{was released}} a month later on October 25, 1994. The single charted and peaked at number four on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, which corresponds to a position of 104 on the Billboard Hot 100. This made it Yankovic's first domestically charting single since 1992's [...] "Smells Like Nirvana".|$|E
500|$|The {{final cut}} of [...] "Cog" [...] {{consists}} of two continuous sixty-second dolly shots taken from a technocrane, stitched together [...] later in post-production. (The stitching appears during {{the moment when the}} muffler rolls across the floor.) Four days of filming were required to get these two shots, two days for each minute-long section. Filming sessions lasted seven hours and the work was exacting, as some parts needed to be positioned with an accuracy of a sixteenth of an inch. Despite the detailed instructions derived from the testing period, small variations in ambient temperature, humidity and settling dust continually threw off the movement of the parts enough to end the sequence early. It took 90 minutes on the first day <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> initial transmission bearing to roll correctly into the second. Between testing and filming, 606takes were needed to capture the final cut. The team commandeered two of Honda's six hand-assembled Accords—one to roll off the trailer {{at the end of the}} advertisement, the other to be stripped for parts. While several sections of the early scripts had to be abandoned due to the total unavailability of certain Accord components, by the time production finished the accumulated spare parts filled two articulated lorries.|$|E

500|$|LoPiccolo {{composed}} the game's score—called [...] "dark", [...] "electronic" [...] and [...] "cyberpunk" [...] by the Boston Herald—on a Macintosh computer and inexpensive synthesizer, using Audio Vision. It dynamically changes {{according to the}} player's actions, a decision made {{in keeping with the}} team's focus on emergent gameplay. Each track was [...] "written at three different intensity levels", which change depending on the player's nearness to enemies; and certain events, such as victory in combat, trigger special music. The game's tracks were composed of four-bar segments that could be rearranged dynamically in reaction to game events, with [...] "melodies through-composed on top". LoPiccolo noted that, when using this method, it is necessary to write music that [...] "still flows with the overall theme and doesn't jump around". Because the score was closely tied to the gameplay, LoPiccolo had to work closely with Church and Rob Fermier, the latter of whom wrote the [...] "interactive scoring module" [...] that allowed for dynamic music. After recording the music, LoPiccolo recorded all of the game's sound effects. He later recalled visiting an automobile repair shop with [...] "portable recorder and a mic", and [...] "having [...] mechanic [...] hit things with wrenches and so forth, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> raw material". He developed the game's audio over 16 months, working on a contractual basis until Tribe disbanded in May 1994; Ned Lerner gave him a full-time job as audio director the next day. Tim Ries {{composed the}} [...] "Elevator" [...] music.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the summer}} of 2010, the stalled Israeli–Palestinian peace process was {{potentially}} revived when the various parties involved agreed to direct talks {{for the first time}} in a while. While President Obama was the orchestrator of the movement, Secretary Clinton had gone through months of cajoling <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> parties to the table, and helped convince the reluctant Palestinians by getting support for direct talks from Egypt and Jordan. She then assumed a prominent role in the talks; Speaking at a September 2 meeting at the State Department between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, she acknowledged that, [...] "We've been here before, and we know how difficult the road ahead will be." [...] Her role in the ongoing talks would be to take over from U.S. Special Envoy for Middle East Peace George J. Mitchell when discussions threatened to break down. The talks were generally given little chance to succeed, and Clinton faced the history of many such past failures, including the near miss of her husband at the 2000 Camp David Summit. Nevertheless, her prominent role in them thrust her further into the international spotlight and had the potential to affect her legacy as secretary.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Stinnett's Day of Deceit {{suggests}} a memorandum prepared by Commander McCollum {{was central to}} U.S. policy in the immediate pre-war period. Stinnett claims the memo suggests only a direct attack on U.S. interests would sway the American public (or Congress) to favor direct involvement in the European war, specifically {{in support of the}} British. An attack by Japan would not, could not, aid Britain. Although the memo was passed to Captains Walter Anderson and Dudley Knox, two of Roosevelt's military advisors, on October 7, 1940, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest Roosevelt ever saw it, while Stinnett's claims of evidence he did is nonexistent. Moreover, although Anderson and Knox offered eight specific plans to aggrieve the Japanese Empire and added, [...] "If by these means Japan could be led to commit an overt act of war, so much the better," [...] of the eight [...] "plans" [...] (actions to be taken) offered in the memo, many if not all were implemented, but there is considerable doubt the McCollom memo was the inspiration. Nonetheless, in Day of Deceit Stinnett claims all action items were implemented. Yet there were numerous instances of members of the Roosevelt Administration insisting on not provoking Japan. Mark Parillo, in his essay The United States in the Pacific, wrote, [...] "hese theories tend to founder on the logic of the situation. Had Roosevelt and other members of his administration known of the attack in advance, they would have been foolish to sacrifice one of the major instruments needed to win the war <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> United States into it." [...] Furthermore, on 5 November 1941, in a joint memo, Stark, CNO, and Marshall, Army Chief of Staff, warned, [...] "if Japan be defeated and Germany remain undefeated, decision will still not have been reached.... War between the United States and Japan should be avoided...." [...] Additionally, in a 21 November 1941 memo, Brigadier Leonard T. Gerow, head of Army War Plans, stated, [...] "one of our present major objectives [...] the avoidance of war with Japan... insure continuance of material assistance to the British." [...] He concluded, [...] "t is of grave importance to our war effort in Europe..." [...] Furthermore, Churchill himself, in a 15 May 1940 telegram, said he hoped a U.S. commitment to aid Britain would [...] "quiet" [...] Japan, following with a 4 October message requesting a USN courtesy visit to Singapore aimed at [...] "preventing the spreading of the war" [...] And Stark's own Plan Dog expressly stated, [...] "Any strength that we might send to the Far East would...reduce the force of our blows against Germany..." [...] Roosevelt could scarcely have been ignorant of Stark's views, and war with Japan was clearly contrary to Roosevelt's express wish to aid Britain and with Churchill's to [...] "quiet" [...] Japan.|$|E

60|$|By his side, {{and leaning}} over him, was Elizabeth, her elder sister. There {{was five years}} between them. She was a poor copy of Beatrice, or, to be more accurate, Beatrice was a grand {{development}} of Elizabeth. They both had brown hair, but Elizabeth's was straighter and faint-coloured, not rich and ruddying into gold. Elizabeth's eyes were also grey, {{but it was a}} cold washed-out grey like that of a February sky. And so with feature after feature, and with the expression also. Beatrice's was noble and open, if at times defiant. Looking at her you knew that she might be a mistaken woman, or a headstrong woman, or both, but she could never be a mean woman. Whichever of the ten commandments she might choose to break, it would not be that which forbids us to bear false witness against our neighbour. Anybody might read it in her eyes.
