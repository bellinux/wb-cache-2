25|$|It once <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> country (and {{this seems}} indeed strange) that a living {{creature}} {{was caught in}} the forest as to which no one could say definitely whether it was a man or some other animal; for no one could get a word from it or be sure that it understood human speech. It had the human shape, however, in every detail, both as to hands and face and feet; but the entire body was covered with hair as the beasts are, and down the back it had a long coarse mane like that of a horse, which fell to both sides and trailed along the ground when the creature stooped in walking.|$|E
500|$|For the Express, {{head coach}} Bill Jones was {{replaced}} by his brother Tony Jones, who assumed the position of interim head coach until February 20, 2016. At this time, Bill was reinstated into the NBL Canada, with Tony remaining with Windsor as an assistant coach. Bill said, [...] "What <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> Game 7 was not Bill Jones. It happened {{in the heat of}} the moment and is something I'll probably regret for the rest of my life." [...] Magley said that his concern with the future of the Express organization helped him make the decision to reinstate Jones, who he believed would help the team's fan support grow.|$|E
500|$|Ragan, who was {{the leader}} before the fifteenth caution, {{described}} his frustration after being black flagged by saying, [...] "It was tough to swallow. Who knows what would have <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> next lap? We had a top-five car [...] and we didn't finish in the top five, so that's a bummer. We had a car that could've won the Daytona 500. We were sitting in position and just didn't do it. This thing only comes around once a year, so I'll think about it until we throw the checkered flag on next year's Daytona 500. So it's tough, {{but there is a}} bright side– we finished, we got some points and we ran up front, but we just didn't get what we come down here to do." ...|$|E

500|$|Cratering is seen on {{both types}} of terrain, but is {{especially}} extensive on the dark terrain: {{it appears to be}} saturated with impact craters and has evolved largely through impact events. The brighter, grooved terrain contains many fewer impact features, which have been only of a minor importance to its tectonic evolution. The density of cratering indicates an age of 4billion years for the dark terrain, similar to the highlands of the Moon, and a somewhat younger age for the grooved terrain (but how much younger is uncertain). Ganymede may have experienced a period of heavy cratering 3.5 to 4billion years ago {{similar to that of the}} Moon. If true, the vast majority of impacts <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> epoch, whereas the cratering rate has been much smaller since. Craters both overlay and are crosscut by the groove systems, indicating that some of the grooves are quite ancient. Relatively young craters with rays of ejecta are also visible. Ganymedian craters are flatter than those on the Moon and Mercury. This is probably due to the relatively weak nature of Ganymede's icy crust, which can (or could) flow and thereby soften the relief. Ancient craters whose relief has disappeared leave only a [...] "ghost" [...] of a crater known as a palimpsest.|$|E

2500|$|In 1902, in {{response}} to concerns over women's rights, Conley built a separate building outside the walls for his female prisoners. [...] It was a small, stuffy building with no plumbing and a tiny exercise yard, but it gave the women inmates a degree of separation and safety they had previously been denied. [...] This building would eventually be converted into a maximum security facility in 1959 {{in response}} to the riot which <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> year, and Montana's women prisoners would eventually be moved to their own prison.|$|E

2500|$|On December 20, 2010 Hamilton {{was arrested}} in Cleveland, Ohio after assaulting an officer. On February 11, 2011 Hamilton would post bail for $25,000 and was {{referred}} for psychiatric treatment. On March 6, 2015 during an interview Hamilton would go more into detail about what <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> situation stating [...] "I {{knew better than to}} punch a cop" [...] Hamilton had just crashed his father's girlfriend's car, which he took without permission or a drivers license. Unharmed, he wandered to Quicken Loans Arena where he began playing what he says was an imaginary basketball with exiting Cavalier fans. [...] "This cop walks over and was like, what are you doing?. I said, Basketball. He puts his arms out to guard me, so I crossed him and he slipped. His partner came over like, What's going on? He grabbed my arm and I punched him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roman and Wilgus, who {{developed}} comics {{based on the}} series for Nick Magazine, consulted series creators Mike Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, and head writer for the show Aaron Ehasz while they were developing Zuko's Story. The four wanted to try a comic that would fit into with {{the continuity of the}} show. The prequel, though mostly associated with the film, {{was meant to be a}} prequel to the series. Roman explained, [...] "In a lot of ways, it's like an expanded origin. With the film and the series, there are differences and there are places where they split off, but the setup for both is exactly the same — so when you're introduced to the characters, that's the part where they're completely identical." [...] The prequel allowed the expansions of different details told in the series; for example, an episode called [...] "The Blue Spirit" [...] in the series was seen in the film. However, since explaining everything that <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> episode was hard to translate onto film, the prequel allowed for them to [...] "delve" [...] into that specific story. What more, when asked about whether he answered some questions that were left open at the end of the series, Roman stated that, while he had a strong relationship with the show's creators and got their blessing for his project, it wasn't his plot to address.|$|E
