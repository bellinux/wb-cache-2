5|$|The Crucifixion {{itself is}} conspicuously absent, {{and there is}} no trace or shadow of its {{presence}} in the panels. Writing in 1996, Wieland Schmied noted that the three Furies have replaced Christ and the two thieves crucified on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> The form of the Furies is borrowed directly from Picasso's late 1920s and mid-1930s pictures of biomorphs on beaches, in particular from the Spanish artist's The Bathers (1937). However, the eroticism and comedy of Picasso's figures have been replaced by a sense of menace and terror derived in part from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Caudy {{participated in}} the French and Indian War and {{is best known for}} having purportedly defended himself from a band of Native American fighters on Caudy's Castle—a {{sandstone}} outcrop that now bears his name. According to tradition, Caudy used his long rifle barrel to push his Native American attackers off the rock into the Cacapon River below. In his later life, Caudy became involved in a land dispute with John Capper that was resolved by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron in November 1762. Caudy died in 1784 and was interred on his property south of present-day Capon Bridge. According to local tradition, Caudy was buried with a Native American on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> while another tradition says Caudy was buried with his horse.|$|E
5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes and another observer on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands {{was placed on the}} top of the table, and the other inside the cage which held an accordion on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light in the room was not stated, and {{the accordion}} was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have come from an automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E

Now the other sword is aloft above him, and that had been Eric's bane, but Skallagrim glances round and sees it about to fall. He has no time to turn, but dashes the hammer of his axe backward. It falls full on the swordsman's head, and the head is shattered.|$|R

Lord Ganesha here is holding a Mango fruit in His hand and is called ‘Maangani Vinayagar’. The place Maangaadu itself had got its name as it was once a vast Mango forest. Lingothbavar is seen on the outer wall behind the sanctum. Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu are present on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Lingothbavar worshipping <b>Him.</b> There is a separate shrine for Sri Veerabadhrar behind the sanctum.

5|$|Caudy {{never learned}} to write in English; he signed his last will and {{testament}} with an X mark in 1784. Caudy died on March 15, 1784, and was interred on his property south of present-day Capon Bridge. According to local tradition, Caudy was buried with a Native American on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Another tradition says he was buried with his horse. The site of Caudy's interment is located on property now known as Hartford Bealer farm. In the 1930s, Caudy's burial site was attended to by a local Boy Scouts troop, who landscaped the site and planted shrubbery. By 1976, Caudy's burial place was marked with four posts. In 2002, the Capon Bridge Ruritan Club removed the overgrown shrubs and erected a white fence around Caudy's interment site. The project was initiated by Capon Bridge area residents Roy Giffin, Ken Edmonds, and Roberta Munske. The Ruritans purchased a marble marker and erected it on the site at 9 a.m. on November 15, 2003. The burial site is accessible and visible from Christian Church Road, West Virginia Secondary Route 13.|$|E
5|$|In essence {{this type}} of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on {{psychological}} shock for effect. Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not {{get close enough to}} the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive. Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. Captain Mercer, who commanded 'G' Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, thought the Brunswick troops on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.|$|E
25|$|In {{between the}} columns were slabs of marble covered in silver about 1.00 to 1.10 meters tall. On {{them had been}} carved the monograms of Justinian and Theodora (6th century), even though Theodora {{had been dead for}} several years, as well as a many-armed cross in the center. On the center of the {{architrave}} was a repoussé medallion of Christ. On <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>Him</b> were medallions of angels, the Prophets, the Apostles, and finally the Virgin Mary. The carvings on the architrave were deeply tied to the liturgy. Another templon roughly contemporary to Hagia Sophia’s is that of the church to St. John of Ephesus, rebuilt by Justinian as a domed crucifix. There was an inscription to St. John the Theologian over a side door, since the crypt of the saint was within the enclosed sanctuary. St. John the Baptist was probably carved over the other door of the templon of Hagia Sophia, since he features prominently in liturgical writings of the church.|$|E

500|$|In this temple, built {{entirely of}} gold, the people worship the statues of three gods.

[...] Near that temple is a very large tree with widespread branches which are always green both in winter and summer. What kind of tree it is nobody knows.

As long as his body is not found, the request of the people will be fulfilled.|$|E

These rockets cause a thunder storm. The resultant lightning strikes an 'Hello Sunshine' horse as it flies through the air and a duplicate horse is created. This happens repeatedly until the sky is full of small horses which fly out of the storm and towards the Super Furries' hot air balloons. The last section shows the band playing [...] "Hello Sunshine" [...] and being confronted by the 'Hello Sunshine' horse who Rhys strokes on the nose.

500|$|Even {{arranging}} the conference proved a struggle, with the Rhodesians taking exception to being served cards of admittance on 27 October denoting them [...] "The Smith Delegation", {{rather than the}} [...] "Rhodesian Government Delegation" [...] as had happened in previous conferences and correspondence. The Rhodesians unilaterally altered their cards to this effect, then confronted Richard with them, causing him some shock. The conference was eventually arranged to commence on 28 October at 15:00, but at very short notice the British mediator delayed the start for two hours; some Patriotic Front delegates were questioning his role as chairman and threatening not to attend, and Richard hoped to talk them around in the extra time. When the parties finally met, some hours later than planned, Muzorewa sat opposite Smith {{as the leader of}} the nationalist delegates, as at Victoria Falls, but with empty seats directly <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> marked [...] "Comrade Enos Nkala" [...] and [...] "Comrade Edson Sithole" [...] respectively—each of these ZANU cadres had refused to attend the opening meeting despite Richard's entreaties. The mediator read an opening statement from British Prime Minister James Callaghan which, to the nationalists' delight and the government's chagrin, referred to the country as [...] "Zimbabwe". The proceedings were then adjourned, to start again the next day.|$|E
