25|$|The {{most likely}} {{hydrocarbon}} source rocks are Early Jurassic marine mudstones. These are fully mature for oil generation {{in the west}} of the British sector, and are mature for <b>gas</b> <b>generation</b> nearby in the Irish sector. Gas-prone, Westphalian pre-rift coal measures may also be present at depth locally. The Cardigan Bay Basin was subjected to two Tertiary phases of compressive uplift, whereas maximum burial that terminated primary hydrocarbon generation was probably around the end of the Cretaceous, or earlier if Cretaceous strata, now missing, were never deposited in the basin. Despite the Tertiary structuration, the Dragon discovery has proved that potentially commercial volumes of hydrocarbons were retained at least locally in Cardigan Bay. In addition to undrilled structural traps, the basin contains untested potential for stratigraphic entrapment of hydrocarbons near synsedimentary faults, especially in the Middle Jurassic section.|$|E
25|$|Orders from {{countries}} fighting World War I required determining charges for different European military rifle cartridges, and production volume supported research for improvements. Improved military rifle propellants included a longitudinal perforation converting each grain to a tube with a progressive burning interior surface allowing a more consistent <b>gas</b> <b>generation</b> rate through the reaction period. Early propellants {{were identified by}} a two-digit number. As the number of experimental variations increased, each improved military rifle propellant was identified by a four-digit number. In addition to the canisters available from DuPont, the Director of Civilian Marksmanship (DCM) sold surplus improved military rifle propellants {{to members of the}} National Rifle Association. By 1936 improved DuPont process control produced batches conforming to published reloading data rather than requiring different charge specifications for each batch; and those propellants have remained in production. Non-conforming batches were used to load commercial and military cartridges following traditional testing procedures.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} <b>gas</b> <b>generation</b> {{presents}} the greatest exploration risk. Maximum burial of, and primary gas migration from, the source rocks could have terminated {{as early as}} the Jurassic, whereas many of the tilted fault blocks were reactivated or created during Paleogene inversion of the basin. However, {{it is also possible that}} a secondary gas charge occurred during regional heating associated with intrusion of Paleogene dykes, such as those that crop out nearby on the coastline of north Wales. (Floodpage et al., 1999) have invoked this second phase of Paleogene hydrocarbon generation as an important factor in the charging of the East Irish Sea Basin's oil and gas fields. It is not clear as yet whether aeromagnetic anomalies in the southeast of Caernarfon Bay are imaging a continuation of the dyke swarm into this area too, or whether they are instead associated with deeply buried Permian syn-rift volcanics. Alternatively, the fault block traps could have been recharged by exsolution of methane from formation brines as a direct result of the Tertiary uplift (cf. Doré and Jensen, 1996).|$|E

40|$|AbstractGas flaring {{for years}} {{has been a major}} {{environmental}} problem {{in many parts of the}} world. One way of solving the problem of gas flaring is to effectively utilize the abundant supply of <b>gas</b> for power <b>generation.</b> To effectively utilize <b>gas</b> for power <b>generation</b> requires highly efficient gas turbines and power facilities. Traditional methods of assessing the efficiency of power generation turbines do not take into consideration the stochastic nature of gas input and power output. This is because in a power generation system, as in any typical production system, there is generally marked variability in both input (gas) and output (power) of the process. This makes the determination of the relationship between input and output quite complex. This work utilized Box-Jenkins transfer function modelling technique, an integral part of statistical principle of time series analysis to model the efficiency of a gas power plant. This improved way of determining the efficiency of <b>gas</b> power <b>generation</b> facilities involves taking input–output data from a <b>gas</b> power <b>generation</b> process over a 10 -year period and developing transfer function models of the process for the ten years, which are used as performance indicators. Based on the performance indicators obtained from the models, the results show that the efficiency of the <b>gas</b> power <b>generation</b> facility was best in the years 2007 – 2011 with a coefficient of performance of 0. 002343345. Similarly, with a coefficient of performance of 0. 002073617, plant performance/efficiency was worst in the years 2002 – 2006. Using the traditional method of calculating efficiency the values of 0. 2613 and 0. 2516 were obtained for years 2002 – 2006 and 2007 – 2011 respectively. The result is remarkable because given the state of the facilities, it correctly predicted the period of expected high system performance i. e. 2002 – 2006 period, but the traditional efficiency measurement method failed to do so. Ordinarily, using efficiency values obtained through the traditional method as the metric, the system managers would assume that the period 2002 – 2006 was better than in the period 2007 – 2011 whereas the reverse is the case. The result of this study is expected to open new ways to improving maintenance effectiveness and efficiency of <b>gas</b> power <b>generation</b> facilities...|$|R
