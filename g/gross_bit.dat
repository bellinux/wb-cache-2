Due to the Manchester line code, each bit is represented by two pulses, resulting in a pulse rate of 20megabaud.|$|E
25|$|The <b>gross</b> <b>bit</b> rate {{is related}} to the symbol rate or {{modulation}} rate, which is expressed in bauds or symbols per second.

5000|$|The play's {{content was}} {{controversial}} among contemporary critics, {{many of whom}} condemned the play as indecent. Muckracking journalist Samuel Hopkins Adams counted {{it as one of}} many plays of [...] "dubious character" [...] that had invaded American theater. He decried its suggestive dialogue, as well as its portrayal of loose women and lecherous men, and described the final act as [...] "the <b>grossest</b> <b>bit</b> of action that I have ever seen on an English-speaking stage". When the play previewed in Trenton, the Trenton Evening Times denounced it as [...] "offensively vulgar and putrid". The New York Times review of the Broadway production said Potter [...] "appears to have gone as far as he thought the police would allow". In The Evening World, reviewer Charles Darnton said the play [...] "tries very hard to be bad, but it only succeeds in being stupid".|$|R
5000|$|Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle {{called it}} a [...] "gutsy remake," [...] saying, [...] "House on Haunted Hill {{is the kind of}} horror movie that's not a bit scary and quite a <b>bit</b> <b>gross.</b> Yet it's also mildly, even pleasantly, entertaining, at least by the diminished {{standard}} set by this summer's The Haunting... it sets up hostile relationships between the characters, which allows the audience to wonder who is doing what to whom. Finding out is not so interesting, but getting there isn't so bad." [...] Maitland McDonough of Film Journal gave the film a similar review, saying [...] "The proceedings are all utterly conventional, but watching them unfold is mildly diverting if you're in the right frame of mind, as many moviegoers apparently were over the Halloween weekend," [...] also favorably comparing the film to Jan de Bont's remake of The Haunting, which was released several months prior.|$|R
25|$|The net {{bit rate}} of the Ethernet 100Base-TX {{physical}} layer standard is 100Mbit/s, while the gross bitrate is 125Mbit/second, due to the 4B5B (four bit over five bit) encoding.

2500|$|For example, the net bitrate (and {{thus the}} [...] "connection speed") of an IEEE 802.11a {{wireless}} network is the {{net bit rate}} of between 6 and 54Mbit/s, while the <b>gross</b> <b>bit</b> rate is between 12 and 72Mbit/s inclusive of error-correcting codes.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "connection speed" [...] of a V.92 {{voiceband}} modem typically {{refers to}} the <b>gross</b> <b>bit</b> rate, {{since there is no}} additional error-correction code.

A lower bit rate may be chosen during the connection establishment phase due to adaptive modulationslower but more robust modulation schemes are chosen in case of poor signal-to-noise ratio. Due to data compression, the actual data transmission rate or throughput (see below) may be higher.|$|E
2500|$|In modems and {{wireless}} systems, link adaptation (automatic adaption {{of the data}} rate and the modulation and/or error coding scheme to the signal quality) is often applied. In that context, the term peak bitrate denotes the net bitrate of the fastest and least robust transmission mode, used for example when the distance is very short between sender and transmitter.

50|$|In telecommunication, data {{signaling}} rate (DSR), {{also known}} as <b>gross</b> <b>bit</b> rate, is the aggregate rate at which data pass {{a point in the}} transmission path of a data transmission system.|$|E

50|$|For example, if a file is transferred, the goodput {{that the}} user {{experiences}} {{corresponds to the}} file size in bits divided by the file transfer time.

50|$|Example 4: The 8VSB (8-level vestigial sideband) {{modulation}} scheme {{used in the}} ATSC digital television standard gives N=3 bit/symbol or bpcu. Since it {{can be described as}} nearly single-side band, the modulation efficiency is close to 2N = 6 (bit/s)/Hz. In practice, ATSC transfers a <b>gross</b> <b>bit</b> rate of 32 Mbit/s over a 6 MHz wide channel, resulting in a modulation efficiency of 32/6 = 5.3 (bit/s)/Hz.|$|E

In more advanced modems and data transmission techniques, a symbol may have more than two states, so it may represent more than one bit. A bit (binary digit) always represents one of two states.|$|E
5000|$|The Up Interface uses two wires. The <b>gross</b> <b>bit</b> rate is 160 kbit/s; 144 kbit/s throughput, 12 kbit/s sync and 4 kbit/s maintenance. The signals on the U {{reference}} point are encoded by two modulation techniques: 2B1Q in North America, Italy and Switzerland, and 4B3T elsewhere. Depending of the applicable cable length, two varieties are implemented, UpN and Up0. The Uk0 interface uses one wire pair with echo cancellation {{for the long}} last mile cable between the telephone exchange and the network terminator. The maximum length of this BRI section is between 4 and 8 km.|$|E
50|$|In the 6 MHz (megahertz) channel {{used for}} {{broadcast}} ATSC, 8VSB carries a symbol rate of 10.76 megabaud, a <b>gross</b> <b>bit</b> rate of 32 Mbit/s, and a {{net bit rate}} of 19.39 Mbit/s of usable data. The net bit rate is lower due to the addition of forward error correction codes. The eight signal levels are selected {{with the use of}} a trellis encoder. There are also similar modulations 2VSB, 4VSB, and 16VSB. 16VSB was notably intended to be used for ATSC digital cable, but quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) has become the de facto industry standard instead as it is cheap and readily available.|$|E

For this calculation, it is conventional to define a normalized rate Rl = R/2B, a bandwidth utilization parameter of bits per second per half hertz, or bits per dimension (a signal of bandwidth B can be encoded with 2B dimensions, according to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem).
