40|$|The {{combination}} of indomethacin, prochlorperazine and caffeine (IPC) is often overused by migraine patients who develop medication-overuse headache (MOH), a secondary chronic headache that resolves after {{withdrawal of the}} overused medication. In a previous study (1) we showed that indomethacin clearance was lower in chronic migraine patients overusing IPC combination than in migraine patients only occasionally taking this combination. Objective: To verify if the reduced clearance of indomethacin reverts to normal after withdrawal of the overused IPC. Methods: We repeated the study of indomethacin pharmacokinetics in 9 female headache patients after 6 months from inpatient withdrawal of the IPC combination. In each patients indomethacin pharmacokinetics had been already studied before withdrawal treatment. The IPC combination (indomethacin 50 mg, prochlorperazine 8 mg, caffeine 150 mg) habitually taken was administered by rectal route to each patient. Blood samples were drawn before dosing and at the following post-dose times: 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 h. Indomethacin concentrations were measured by HPLC method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated {{by means of the}} P K Solutions 2. 0 program. Results: The pharmacokinetic parameters of indomethacin in 4 patients (group A) who relapsed in IPC overuse were similar to those observed before withdrawal treatment; instead (Table 1) in 5 patients (group B) who steadily discontinued IPC combination, indomethacin disposition was significantly different from that observed before withdrawal treatment.

40|$|ObjectiveThe study {{compared}} the short-term outcome of distal perfusion in thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm surgery using a mini-circuit and nonocclusive femoral cannulation {{with a traditional}} setup using a roller pump and occlusive cannulation. MethodsA total of 120 consecutive patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair with femoro-femoral distal perfusion from 2005 to 2008 were included in this retrospective study. Perfusion was accomplished with either a mini-circuit (centrifugal pump, low priming volume, heparin coating) and nonocclusive femoral cannulation (N =  48, group A) or conventional roller pump and occlusive cannulation (N =  72, <b>group</b> <b>B).</b> <b>Parameters</b> representing tissue damage or ischemia (lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, myoglobin, creatinine, glomerular filtration rate) were monitored intraoperatively and postoperatively and compared. ResultsOne patient from each group required renal dialysis postoperatively. Myoglobin values were similar in both groups. Creatine kinase was significantly higher in <b>group</b> <b>B</b> (P < . 001). Hemolysis represented from lactate dehydrogenase was higher in <b>group</b> <b>B</b> (P = . 005). Both the traditional setup and the mini-circuit achieved a return to preoperative glomerular filtration rate by postoperative day 10 with a significantly higher decrease of glomerular filtration rate within 10 days in <b>group</b> <b>B.</b> ConclusionsThe use of mini-circuits for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm surgery is safe. Compared with patients undergoing suprarenal clamping for abdominal aortic aneurysm, distal and organ perfusion in thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm surgery maintain renal function independently of the technical setup. An initial decay of glomerular filtration rate on postoperative days 1 to 4, however, seems {{to be related to}} intraoperative leg ischemia and hemolysis caused by occlusive cannulation of the femoral vessels and the roller pump.

However, {{little is known about}} the clinical significance of T-wave alternans measurement in survivors of ventricular fibrillation (VF) or hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT). Methods: We studied 28 patients with organic heart disease who survived VF or hemodynamically unstable VT (20 males, mean age 63 years). Echocardiography, electrocardiogram (QRS duration and QTc intervals), and Holter monitoring (heart rate variability, heart rate turbulence and T-wave alternans) were performed before implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. Positive T-wave alternans was defined as > 65  μV. During the follow-up period (10. 2 ± 6. 2 months), ventricular tachyarrhythmias requiring appropriate shock therapy occurred in eight patients (29 %). The subjects were divided into two groups, based on whether appropriate shock therapy was required (n= 8, Group A) or not (n= 20, <b>Group</b> <b>B).</b> <b>Parameters</b> from echocardiography, electrocardiogram, and Holter monitoring were compared between the two groups in order to investigate their relationship with the incidence of shock therapy after ICD implantation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Intrathecal drug {{delivery}} using implantable pumps {{is an effective}} method to control stable chronic pain. However, the appropriate alleviation of unpredictable pain fluctuations remains challenging. A possible solution {{is the use of}} patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) by means of a specific device [...] the personal therapy manager (PTM) [...] designed to be used with implanted programmable pumps. METHODS: A multicenter (n = 17), open-label registry recording 168 patients suffering from chronic pain with unsatisfactory control of pain episodes was initiated. While 79 patients (47 %) (group A) already carried an implanted pump at enrollment, all other patients were implanted after being registered in the study (<b>group</b> <b>B).</b> <b>Parameters</b> assessed included pain relief (visual analog score, VAS), quality of life (EQ- 5 D), patient and physician satisfaction, medication use, PTM programming parameters and adverse events. Final follow-up was at 12 months. RESULTS: At 12 months, there was a significant reduction (29 %) of the overall average VAS compared with baseline (P < 0. 01) in patients with newly implanted devices (<b>group</b> <b>B).</b> All patients tended to decrease the concomitant pain medication and the quality of life tended to improve (10 % on the EQ- 5 D scale). In total, 85 % of patients were satisfied with the PTM. No serious adverse events related {{to the use of the}} PTM device were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-controlled analgesia using a PTM with a programmable, implantable pump system is an effective therapy for the treatment of chronic pain and allows patients to feel that they have more control over unpredictable pain fluctuations...|$|R

The optic nerve head of 22 eyes (22 patients) was analyzed by confocal laser tomography with the Heidelberg retinal tomogram (HRT) before and after trabeculectomy. The median time between the first HRT and surgery was 4. 6 months (mean: 7. 7 ± 8. 3) and the median time between surgery and the second HRT was 10. 8 months (mean: 12. 0 ± 6. 8). The patients were divided into two groups, i. e., those with the highest (group A) and lowest (<b>group</b> <b>B)</b> intraocular pressure (IOP) change after surgery. Differences in the 12 standard topographic parameters before and after surgery for each group were evaluated by the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the differences in these parameters between the two groups were compared by the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate the influence of the change in IOP (deltaIOP and deltaIOP%) and the changes in the other parameters. There were significant differences in the HRT measures before and after surgery in group A only for cup volume. In <b>group</b> <b>B,</b> no <b>parameter</b> was statistically different. The changes in group A were not significantly different than those in <b>group</b> <b>B</b> for any <b>parameter</b> (P > 0. 004, Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). deltaIOP and deltaIOP% had a statistically significant effect on delta cup disk area, delta cup volume and delta mean cup depth.

40|$|Adjusting {{hemodynamics}} via {{flow diverter}} (FD) implantation {{is emerging as}} a novel method of treating cerebral aneurysms. However, most previous FD-related hemodynamic studies were based on virtual FD deployment, which may produce different hemodynamic outcomes than realistic (in vivo) FD deployment. We compared hemodynamics between virtual FD and realistic FD deployments in rabbit aneurysm models using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. FDs were implanted for aneurysms in 14 rabbits. Vascular models based on rabbit-specific angiograms were reconstructed for CFD studies. Real FD configurations were reconstructed based on micro-CT scans after sacrifice, while virtual FD configurations were constructed with SolidWorks software. Hemodynamic parameters before and after FD deployment were analyzed. According to the metal coverage (MC) of implanted FDs calculated based on micro-CT reconstruction, 14 rabbits were divided into two groups (A, MC > 35 %; B, MC 0. 05).

Methods: Thirty-two patients with CHF (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 40 %; mean, 33 % 6 %) were treated with an ACE inhibitor and a loop diuretic. Sixteen patients (group A) were randomized to additionally receive valsartan (40 – 80 mg/d), and the remaining 16 patients (<b>group</b> <b>B)</b> contin-ued their current regimen. Patients were studied before and 6 mo after treatment. The delayed heart-to-mediastinum count ratio (H/M ratio), delayed total defect score (TDS), and washout rate (WR) were determined from 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine images. The left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and LVEF were determined by echocardiography, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class was estimated. Re-sults: Before treatment, TDS, H/M ratio, WR, LVEDV, LVEF, and NYHA functional class were similar in both groups. After treat-ment in group A, TDS decreased from 37 8 to 31 9 (P 0. 001), H/M ratio increased from 1. 66 0. 23 to 1. 81 0. 23 (P 0. 001), and WR decreased from 47 % 9 % to 39 % 10 % (P 0. 01).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Restoration {{of nerve}} {{continuity}} and effective maintenance of coaptation are considered fundamental principles of end-to-end peripheral nerve repair. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate {{the influence of}} the number of stitches on axonal regeneration and collagen production after neurorrhaphy. METHODS: Thirty male Wistar rats were equally divided into 3 groups and were all operated on with the right sciatic nerve exposed. In 2 groups, the nerve was sectioned and repaired by means of 3 (<b>group</b> <b>B)</b> or 6 (<b>group</b> C) epineurium sutures with 100 monofilament nylon. One group (group A) was used as a control. Each animal from <b>groups</b> <b>B</b> and C underwent electrophysiological evaluation with motor action potential recordings before nerve section and again at an 8 -week interval after neurorrhaphy. Nerve biopsy specimens were used for histomorphometric assessment of axonal regeneration and quantification of collagen at the repair site. RESULTS: Animals from group C had significantly lower motor action potential conduction velocities compared with control animals (P =. 02), and no significant difference was seen between <b>groups</b> <b>B</b> and C. <b>Parameters</b> obtained from morphometric evaluation were not significantly different between these 2 groups. Type I collagen and III collagen in the epineurium were significantly higher in group C than in either the control group (P =. 001 and P =. 003) or <b>group</b> <b>B</b> (P =. 01 and P =. 02). No differences were identified for collagen I and III in the endoneurium. CONCLUSION: Using 6 sutures for nerve repair is associated with worse electrophysiological outcomes and higher amounts of type I and III collagen in the epineurium compared with control. Neurorraphy with 6 stitches is also related to a significant increase in epineurium collagen I and III compared with 3 -stitch neurorraphy.

Conclusions: In our conclusion, we suggest that a montelukast is as effective as formoterol fumarate for add-on therapy to budesonide in moderate persistent asthma. Hence, montelukast can be considered an alternate therapeutic option for such patients. The results of this study are expected to provide physicians with clinical evidence to help them make a rational decision when treating patients with moderate persistent asthma...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Comparatively {{little is}} known about the {{relation}} between the sagittal vertical axis and clinical outcome in cases of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. The objective of this study was to determine whether lumbar sagittal balance affects clinical outcomes after posterior interbody fusion. This series suggests that consideration of sagittal balance during posterior interbody fusion for degenerative spondylolisthesis can yield high levels of patient satisfaction and restore spinal balance Methods A retrospective study of clinical outcomes and a radiological review was performed on 18 patients with one or two level degenerative spondylolisthesis. Patients were divided into two groups: the patients without improvement in pelvic tilt, postoperatively (Group A; n = 10) and the patients with improvement in pelvic tilt postoperatively (Group B; n = 8). Pre- and postoperative clinical outcome surveys were administered to determine Visual Analogue Pain Scores (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI). In addition, we evaluated full spine radiographic films for pelvic tilt (PT), sacral slope (SS), pelvic incidence (PI), thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumbar lordosis (LL), sacrofemoral distance (SFD), and sacro C 7 plumb line distance (SC 7 D) Results All 18 patients underwent surgery principally for the relief of radicular leg pain and back pain. In <b>groups</b> A and <b>B,</b> mean preoperative VAS were 6. 85 and 6. 81, respectively, and these improved to 3. 20 and 1. 63 at last follow-up. Mean preoperative ODI were 43. 2 and 50. 4, respectively, and these improved to 23. 6 and 18. 9 at last follow-up. In spinopelvic parameters, no significant difference was found between preoperative and follow up variables except PT in Group A. However, significant difference was found between the preoperative and follows up values of PT, SS, TK, LL, and SFD/SC 7 D in <b>Group</b> <b>B.</b> Between <b>parameters</b> of <b>group</b> A and <b>B,</b> there is borderline significance on preoperative PT, preoperative LL and last follow up SS. Correlation analysis revealed the VAS improvements in Group A were significantly related to postoperative lumbar lordosis (Pearson's coefficient = - 0. 829; p = 0. 003). Similarly, ODI improvements were also associated with postoperative lumbar lordosis (Pearson's coefficient = - 0. 700; p = 0. 024). However, in <b>Group</b> <b>B,</b> VAS and ODI improvements were not found to be related to postoperative lumbar lordosis and to spinopelvic parameters. Conclusion In the current series, patients improving PT after fusion were found to achieve good clinical outcomes in degenerative spondylolisthesis. Overall, our findings show that it is important to quantify sagittal spinopelvic parameters and promote sagittal balance when performing lumbar fusion for degenerative spondylolisthesis. </p...|$|R

ObjectiveThis work was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of tube cecostomy as an alternative to colostomy in the managing patients with left-sided colonic carcinoma and rectal cancer in terms of occurrence of postoperative morbidity and mortality and the functional outcome. Design and settingsA total number of 156 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in the study and were divided randomly into two equal groups. PatientsA group of 78 patients underwent tube cecostomy (group A) were compared with the other 78 patients who underwent loop colostomy (<b>group</b> <b>B).</b> The outcome <b>parameters</b> were the incidence of anastomotic leak, operative time, primary operation mortality rate, patient satisfaction and hospital stay. ResultsThe mean operating time and the mean hospital slay was significantly shorter in tube cecostomy group when compared with loop colostomy group (P <  0. 05). The overall recorded morbidity for the primary operation was 12. 8 % and 29. 5 % for <b>group</b> A and <b>B</b> respectively [P ≥  0. 05] while the stoma related complications rate was 7. 7 % and 25. 6 % for each group respectively [P ≤  0. 05].

40|$|Abstract Background Sox domain {{containing}} {{genes are}} important metazoan transcriptional regulators implicated {{in a wide}} rage of developmental processes. The vertebrate B subgroup contains the Sox 1, Sox 2 and Sox 3 genes that have early functions in neural development. Previous studies show that Drosophila <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> genes have been functionally conserved since they play essential roles in early neural specification and mutations in the Drosophila Dichaete and SoxN genes can be rescued with mammalian Sox genes. Despite their importance, the extent and organisation of the <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> family in Drosophila has not been fully characterised, {{an important step in}} using Drosophila to examine conserved aspects of <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> Sox gene function. Results We have used the directed cDNA sequencing along with the output from the publicly-available genome sequencing projects to examine the structure of <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> Sox domain genes in Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura, Anopheles gambiae and Apis mellifora. All of the insect genomes contain four genes encoding <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> proteins, two of which are intronless, {{as is the case with}} vertebrate <b>group</b> <b>B</b> genes. As has been previously reported and unusually for <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> genes, two of the insect <b>group</b> <b>B</b> genes, Sox 21 a and Sox 21 b, contain introns within their DNA-binding domains. We find that the highly unusual multi-exon structure of the Sox 21 b gene is common to the insects. In addition, we find that three of the <b>group</b> <b>B</b> Sox genes are organised in a linked cluster in the insect genomes. By in situ hybridisation we show that the pattern of expression of each of the four <b>group</b> <b>B</b> genes during embryogenesis is conserved between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. Conclusion The DNA-binding domain sequences and genomic organisation of the <b>group</b> <b>B</b> genes have been conserved over 300 My of evolution since the last common ancestor of the Hymenoptera and the Diptera. Our analysis suggests insects have two <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> 1 genes, SoxN and Dichaete, and two <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> 2 genes. The genomic organisation of Dichaete and another two <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> genes in a cluster, suggests they may be under concerted regulatory control. Our analysis suggests a simple model for the evolution of <b>group</b> <b>B</b> Sox genes in insects that differs from the proposed evolution of vertebrate <b>Group</b> <b>B</b> genes. </p...|$|R
