5|$|MS usually {{appears in}} adults {{in their late}} twenties or early thirties but it can rarely start in {{childhood}} and after 50 years of age. The primary progressive subtype {{is more common in}} people in their fifties. Similar to many autoimmune disorders, the disease is more common in women, and the trend may be increasing. As of 2008, globally it is about two times more common in women than in men. In children, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> common in females than males, while in people over fifty, it affects males and females almost equally.|$|E
5|$|Freya {{explains}} how {{she came to}} inhabit Chi's body. She reveals that she and Chi merely switched places inside the body, but Chi has shut herself away and Freya cannot contact her. Hideki asks why, and Freya explains that Chi discovered there were certain things that humans could do that she could not, leading her to believe that while Hideki would love her, it would make her existence unbearable. Hideki protests that it would not, but Freya tells him that Chi thought otherwise. She then tells Chitose {{that the time has}} come to destroy both of them, and she reluctantly agrees. Against Hideki's protestations, she deactivates Freya. Chi, however, has survived the deactivation and comes to the conclusion that while life with Hideki may seem painful because of her limitations, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> painful without him. She regains control of her body and completes her program, giving every persocom the ability to love then embraces Hideki.|$|E
25|$|Daily calcium supplementation and {{possibly}} Vitamin D3 and K2 are {{probably a good}} idea for most transgender men, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> important after removal of the ovaries.|$|E
50|$|Frenzy was a {{less popular}} game than Berzerk, {{possibly}} because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> difficult.|$|R
5000|$|Nobby of KapanLagi.com {{noted that}} Harmoni Cinta left {{a very similar}} {{impression}} to Gutawa's debut album, writing that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> [...] "mature and honed." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Why Me?" [...] {{continued}} Cara's run of hit singles, {{reaching the}} Top 20 on the Hot 100. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> successful in Australia and several European countries, where it peaked within the Top 5.|$|R
25|$|From {{roughly the}} mid-1990s onward, Tai Chi {{has gained a}} {{popularity}} in some countries {{to the point of}} it becoming nearly as known as a health-oriented practice as Yoga. In fact, in modern times <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> known for such benefits and methods of practice than it is known for its original purpose.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> tragic {{that other}} world leaders who witness {{repression}} pretend {{it is not}} happening, or is exaggerated. When history eventually deals with the dictators, those who stood by and watched should also bear the consequences. A shameful quality {{of the modern world}} is to turn away from injustice and ignore the hardships of others.|$|E
25|$|I {{believe that}} {{education}} {{is one of the}} keys to lasting peace in the Middle East... Ever since we first raised this issue some years ago there still has not been an adequate repudiation of incitement by the Palestinian Authority. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> disturbing that the problem appears to have gotten worse. These textbooks don't give Palestinian children an education, they give them an indoctrination.|$|E
5000|$|... 2 in Germany, {{the song}} was the 13th best-selling of 2008 and the 15th best-selling single of 2009. In the decade 2000-2009, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> successful, making <b>it</b> the fifth best-selling song of that decade.|$|R
50|$|There {{were only}} a few schools in the 1930s as the Rana regime did not want {{ordinary}} citizens to get an education. For girls, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> difficult to join school. So Tara Devi received informal tuition at home.|$|R
50|$|Adriaanse {{gained a}} lot of fame in the Netherlands after {{qualifying}} for the Champions League with the average Dutch club Willem II. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> impressive, because Willem II often played attacking football, a style Adriaanse has adopted throughout his managerial career.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> amazing how, for instance, anyone {{managed to}} get the forty-plus members of the camp symphony orchestra, or of the brass band, or of one of the {{dramatic}} societies, not to mention the football or swimming teams, together for practices. Moreover, the various music groups and sporting societies were soon to be found performing in various parts of Northeast England by popular request.|$|E
25|$|Computational {{chemical}} {{methods can}} be applied to solid state physics problems. The electronic structure of a crystal is in general described by a band structure, which defines the energies of electron orbitals for each point in the Brillouin zone. Ab initio and semi-empirical calculations yield orbital energies; therefore, they {{can be applied}} to band structure calculations. Since it is time-consuming to calculate the energy for a molecule, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> time-consuming to calculate them for the entire list of points in the Brillouin zone.|$|E
25|$|Customer horizon {{indicates}} the market orientation {{of a company}} {{in the case of}} netchains. In a chain and network environment it reflects the ability of companies to identify downstream customers and what they need. The phrase and two measurements of customer horizons, breadth and length, were introduced by Storer, Holman and Pedersen in 2010. The importance of market orientation becomes more complicated in a netchain environment, because it is harder to identify the customers of a specific unit. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> important for companies to allocate resources for this purpose in netchains.|$|E

60|$|What Louis {{said of her}} to his tutor on the Monday {{night of}} their arrival was {{beyond the bounds of}} all reason; and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> memorable that Jem was neither satirical nor disputatious, assented to all, and if he sighed, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> after his door was shut.|$|R
5000|$|The largest {{towns are}} Ermoupoli, Ano Syros, and [...] Ermoupoli is {{the capital of}} the island and of the Cyclades. <b>It</b> has always <b>been</b> a {{significant}} port town, and during the 19th century <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> significant than Piraeus. Other villages are Galissas, Foinikas, Pagos, Manna, Kini and Poseidonia.|$|R
25|$|The {{most obvious}} {{evidence}} for this model is that carnivorous plants tend to grow in habitats where water and light are abundant and where competition is relatively low: the typical bog. Those that do not tend {{to be even more}} fastidious in some other way. Drosophyllum lusitanicum grows where there is little water, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> extreme in its requirement for bright light and low disturbance than most other carnivores. Pinguicula valisneriifolia grows in soils with high levels of calcium but requires strong illumination and lower competition than many butterworts.|$|E
25|$|On 26 June, Morsi {{delivered}} a two-hour-and-forty-minute {{speech to the}} nation. It {{was supposed to be}} a re-conciliatory speech but was widely viewed as provocative and full of threats and accusations targeted against his opponents including media presenters and Ahmed Shafik, his former rival in the 2012 Egyptian presidential elections. He used questionable statistics to describe accomplishments made by his administration in tourism and unemployment. After the speech the opposition stated that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> determined to take to the streets on the planned 30 June uprising against the president.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> amazing however {{that all}} these {{societies}} had but one main aim behind their various activities, apart that is from enjoying themselves, which was {{to raise money for}} wartime charities, to help orphans, war-widows, refugee families, disabled soldiers, prisoners of war; or even to buy new boots for soldiers serving in the trenches. As Fabry puts it:‘Each of the many different societies in Elisabethville has a character all its own, yet a common basis: philanthropy. We need recreation, but of a sort that helps the unfortunate’.The total amount raised probably equates to hundreds of thousands of pounds today, if not millions.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} 19th and {{beginning}} of the 20th centuries, Alupka was a famous resort. In the middle of 19th century <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> popular than Yalta, mostly because {{of the work of}} the Governor of NovoRossia - Mikhail Vorontsov, who build here a Palace (or even better say, Castle).|$|R
5000|$|After 1960, the Camlin {{was home}} to the Italian Consulate, among other things. One in particular, a 40 ft yacht {{floating}} in the pool, as a promotional gimmick. When the boat’s bilge pump malfunctioned, and it started taking on water, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> of an advertisement: “Boat sinks in Downtown Seattle.” ...|$|R
60|$|So the Prince {{gave her}} {{his hand and}} led her out, and they mounted the chariot together; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> splendid than before, {{and so was the}} whole company. Even the horses' shoes were of rubies with diamond nails, and I suppose that is the first time such a thing was ever seen.|$|R
500|$|... "Instant Crush" [...] {{was based}} on a demo that Daft Punk {{presented}} to Julian Casablancas; he became enthused upon hearing it and provided vocals. The song contains rock influences and a guitar solo. Critic John Balfe considered it [...] "appropriately Strokes-ish, even if [...] trademark drawl is fed quite substantially through a vocoder." [...] De Homem-Christo noted, [...] "It is true that it is not his usual register, it is the way Julian reacted to the track so for us <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> exciting." [...] "Lose Yourself to Dance" [...] features Pharrell Williams and {{was the result of a}} desire to create dance music with live drummers. To that end, Robinson appears as session player. A vocoder chant of [...] "come on" [...] appears in the song alongside Pharrell Williams's singing.|$|E
500|$|Lundomys molitor is semiaquatic in habits, {{spending}} {{much of its}} time in the water, and is active during the night. An excellent swimmer, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> specialized for swimming than is Holochilus. It builds a spherical nest among reeds in up to [...] deep water, usually about [...] above the water. The material for the nest, which is [...] in diameter and 9 to 11cm (about 4in) in height, comes from the surrounding reeds. Its wall consists of three layers, surrounding a central chamber, which {{is connected to the}} water by a ramp, also composed of reeds. Nests built by members of the related genus Holochilus are similar in many details. Several dissected stomachs contained green plant material, suggesting that it is herbivorous, like Holochilus. A female caught in April was pregnant with three embryos, which were about [...] long. The mites Gigantolaelaps wolffsohni and Amblyomma dubitatum have been found on specimens of L.molitor in Uruguay. Other rodents found in association with it include Scapteromys tumidus, Oligoryzomys nigripes, Reithrodon auritus, Akodon azarae, Oxymycterus nasutus, and Holochilus brasiliensis.|$|E
2500|$|Stratfor, {{a private}} {{intelligence}} agency {{based in the}} United States, speculates that [...] "considering regional developments {{in the past few}} weeks, this [...] "bomb" [...] was far more likely a Georgian ploy than a Russian one. (And <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> likely that it was accidentally dropped by an under-loved and under-maintained Georgian aircraft rather than deliberately targeted.)".|$|E
2500|$|A Taipei Times {{editorial}} said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{inappropriate to}} use [...] "stability, harmony, development" [...] {{to justify the}} lack {{of democracy in the}} already stable, harmonious and developed Hong Kong. [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> further said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> ironic that Beijing claimed to know [...] "mainstream public opinion" [...] before a referendum has <b>even</b> <b>been</b> held.|$|R
60|$|If his mother's {{unexpected}} {{death was}} a shock to poor Matt, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> of a one to Mr. Lincoln. Again was the father and husband's mind unbalanced; this time far worse than ever before. He escaped from the asylum, made a dramatic appearance at the home during the burial services, and then disappeared, no one knew where.|$|R

2500|$|Although the Eastern Fathers {{were aware}} that in the West the {{procession}} of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son was taught, they did not generally regard it as heretical: [...] "a whole series of Western writers, including popes who are venerated as saints by the Eastern church, confess the procession of the Holy Spirit also from the Son; and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> striking that {{there is virtually no}} disagreement with this theory." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{difficult}} {{as it is to}} evaluate the effects of current cloud cover characteristics on climate change, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> problematic to predict the outcome of this change with respect to future cloud patterns and events. [...] As a consequence, much research has focused on the response of low and vertical clouds to a changing climate. Leading global models can produce quite different results, however, with some showing increasing low-étage clouds and others showing decreases.|$|E
2500|$|... "It is {{important}} that you have outside interests, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> important that you have great interest in your profession, that you {{see it on the}} high plane where it belongs in order that you may have pride in it. I am interested in education because it is the only hope in a [...] democratic country like ours. The striving of man for an education is an effort on his part to understand better the universe in which he lives." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> very disagreeable to me, and I know <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so to Rectus, {{to stand}} {{here and have}} those strangers watch us fishing. If we had not been barefooted and bare-legged, {{we should not have}} minded it so much. As for the old Minorcan, I don't suppose he cared at all. I began to think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to stop.|$|R
5000|$|The sequel [...] "Edd the Duck 2: Back with a Quack!" [...] was {{released}} in 1992 on the Amiga. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> poorly received than the first game, with one reviewer saying [...] "I haven't seen a game this awful {{in a very long}} time" [...] and that it [...] "somehow manages to <b>be</b> <b>even</b> worse than the first Edd The Duck game".|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{extremely}} popular in its day, and from its first recording by Tom Bryce on April 29, 1899, became a standard among Scottish folk and dance musicians. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> widely {{known from the}} 1960s onwards and has remained popular in mainstream music genres. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> performed to great acclaim and recorded by artist and social activist Paul Robeson in 1959 and 1960.|$|R
