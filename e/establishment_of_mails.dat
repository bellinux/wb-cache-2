50|$|In 1786 a royal {{decision}} was made to establish a postal route between Bergen and Trondheim. From the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> in Norway in 1647 until then, all mail between those cities went over Oslo. To begin with, the route was for large parts usable for walking and horse riding only, but in the next decades it was rebuilt to allow horse carriages. Several parts required boat. The route was Bergen-Åsane-Hordvik-(boat over Salhusfjorden)-Isdal-Hundvin-Gulen-Rutledal-(boat over Sognefjorden)-Leirvik(Hyllestad)-Flekke-Dale-Bygstad-Førde-Jølster-Gloppen-(boat over Nordfjord)-Faleide(Stryn)-Hornindal-Hellesylt-Stranda-(boat along Storfjorden)-Sjøholt-Vestnes-(boat over Romsdalsfjorden)-Molde-Angvik-(boat over Tingvollfjorden)-Tingvoll-(boat over Halsafjord)-Stangvik-Skei-Rindal-Orkanger-Trondheim. The 1786 decision included also a mail route between Stavanger and Bergen.In 1858, mail were rerouted to newly established steam ships Bergen-Vadheim, and the mail route changed to Vadheim-Sande-Førde, in parts precisely along today's route.|$|R

50|$|By 1834, a road {{had been}} {{surveyed}} from Perth to Kelmscott {{and within a}} few years roads to Albany and Bunbury were also marked out enabling the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> overland <b>mail</b> services. However, it was not until 1851 that work began to properly form the road between Perth and Kelmscott. The work was assisted by the arrival of convict labour in 1852, and during the next few years the roads from Kelmscott to Albany and from Kelmscott to Pinjarra were formed. It was at the junction of the roads to Albany and Pinjarra that the township of Armadale was born when an enterprising settler saw opportunity to establish a wayside inn there, some time around 1853. The property was sold to Thomas Saw in 1856, and together with his father-in-law, Henry Gibbs, in 1856 he applied for a wayside licence to sell liquor. Their wayside inn was named the Neerigin Inn after the brook that flowed out of the Darling Range at this point. For many years the district was known as Neerigin or Narrogin, and a hotel bearing this name still stands {{on the site of the}} original wayside inn.|$|R
5000|$|No mail routes existed {{initially}} in this newly settled frontier, but {{by about}} 1880 the community became {{a stop on}} a mail route between Cisco and Brownwood. Prior to the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> this <b>mail</b> route, the families received mail from Sipe Springs. In 1881 the town sent a petition to the U.S. Government asking for a new post office in the area. The community leaders were required to suggest {{a name for the}} post office and decided upon the name 'Star,' which was then sent for approval to the Postal Service. The Postal Service sent word back that a post office under the name 'Star' was already located in Texas (in Mills County). The citizens called a meeting to select another name and, after many long hours of deliberation, Little Andy Agnew proposed that, [...] "Since we are a rising young community, why don't we just call ourselves 'Rising Star.'" [...] The name was agreed to and accepted by the Postal Service. From 1910 through 1911 a spur of the Texas Central line (Katy Railroad) was constructed to the west 40 miles from De Leon to Cross Plains through Rising Star. The Katy abandoned the spur in the 1940s.|$|R
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1850 s there were high hopes in the Australian colonies that the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> government-subsidised steamship <b>mail</b> services between Britain and Australia would regularise the flow of news and hence enable a more predictable and productive economic, political and social engagement between the colonies and the Mother Country. There was also a growing awareness that colonial expansion by European powers and increasing globalisation of shipping and trade meant that wars amongst European states were increasingly likely to have global ramifications. Feelings of insecurity were exacerbated by the irregularity of communication and by the unreliability of much news from overseas. As it turned out, there was little improvement in communication between Britain and Australia throughout the 1850 s. Steamship services, first introduced in 1852, were plagued by technical and commercial failure. Furthermore, the Crimean War had a major impact on services as the demand for troopships it generated diverted steamship resources from the Australian route to the Mediterranean. Just when news from Europe was most eagerly wanted by colonial Australians, the system <b>of</b> <b>mail</b> steamships which promised the long sought for regularity in its flow was withdrawn, replaced for a period by unpredictable sailing packets...|$|R

50|$|Empire Air Mail Scheme (EAMS) was {{an attempt}} by the British Air Ministry to regain {{leadership}} of world civil aviation in the late 1930s following the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> The Air <b>Mail</b> Route from Cairo to Bagdad in the early 1920s. Conceived in 1934 by Sir Eric Geddes, chairman of Imperial Airways, EAMS sought to greatly expand British civil aviation by shifting all ‘first class’ mail within the British Empire by air. Imperial Airways was a private company, but like most airlines of the era, relied on public subsidies (in this case, from the Air Ministry) to support its operations. A critical driving force behind EAMS was Sir Christopher Llewellyn Bullock K.C.B, C.B.E., Permanent Under-Secretary at the British Air Ministry from 1931 to 1936. Appointed at the age of 38, he remains one of the youngest civil servants to have headed a British Government department.|$|R
