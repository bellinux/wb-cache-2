Several synthetic experiments show the advantages of incorporating information about the corruption into the algorithm. Further experiments on image data confirm the importance of considering a low-rank component in the data and show that the algorithm compares favourably to its closest dictionary learning counterparts, wKSVD and BPFA, either in terms of computational complexity or in terms of consistency between the dictionaries learned from corrupted and uncorrupted data. To further confirm the appropriateness of the learned dictionaries, we explore an application to sparsity-based image inpainting. There the ITKrMM dictionaries show a similar performance to other learned dictionaries like wKSVD and BPFA and a superior performance to other algorithms based on pre-defined/analytic dictionaries.|$|E
3000|$|Most {{reactive}} {{routing protocols}} in MANETs employ a random delay between rebroadcasting route requests (RREQ) {{in order to}} avoid [...] "broadcast storms." [...] However this can lead to problems such as [...] "next hop racing" [...] and [...] "rebroadcast redundancy." [...] In addition to this, existing routing protocols for MANETs usually take a single routing strategy for all flows. This may lead to inefficient use of resources. In this paper we propose a cross-layer route discovery framework (CRDF) to address these problems by exploiting the cross-layer information. CRDF solves the above problems efficiently and enables a new technique: routing strategy automation (RoSAuto). RoSAuto refers to the technique that each source node automatically decides the routing strategy based on the application requirements and each intermediate node <b>further</b> <b>adapts</b> the routing strategy so that the network resource usage can be optimized.

In this thesis work, we take a scheduling approach to improve the performance and to provide quality guarantees for in-network sensor query processing. Specifically, we propose the following three scheduling schemes: (1) DCS (Distributed, Cross-layer Scheduling), (2) AHS (Adaptive, Holistic Scheduling), and (3) QAS (Quality-Aware Scheduling). Each of the three schemes addresses a distinct aspect of the problem; collectively, they serve a wide arrange of applications. In DCS, each node utilizes cross-layer information to determine time slots for query processing and arranges its own sleep and communication timings in coordination with its neighbors for reliable query result reporting. AHS <b>further</b> <b>adapts</b> the schedules of both query operators and wireless communication to runtime dynamics for continual efficiency.

40|$|Abstract. Inverse {{inference}} {{has recently}} {{become a popular}} approach {{for the analysis of}} neuroimaging data, that quantifies the amount of information contained in brain images on perceptual, cognitive and behavioral parameters. As it outlines regions of the brain that convey information for accurately predicting the parameter of interest, it is also used to understand how the corresponding information is encoded in the brain. However, it relies on a prediction function that is plagued by the curse of dimensionality, as there are far more features (voxels) than samples (images). Dimension reduction is thus a mandatory step to extract relevant information from the whole set of features. Among different approaches, regularized regression/classification perform jointly the selection of relevant features and the learning of the associated parameters. Unlike classical alternatives, Bayesian regularization <b>further</b> <b>adapts</b> the amount of regularization to the available data. We introduce in this paper an new model, Multi-Class Sparse Bayesian Regression (MCBR), that is a generalization of classical Bayesian approaches. MCBR consists in grouping the features into several classes, and then to regularize each class differently in order to apply an adaptive and efficient regularization. We detail this framework and validate our algorithm on simulated and real neuroimaging data sets, showing that it performs better than reference methods while yielding interpretable clusters of features. ...|$|E

40|$|Reliability {{assessment}} of slender concrete columns using Non-linear {{finite element analysis}} (NLFEA) is studied in this thesis. Several reliability methods in combination with NLFEA are applied and discussed to assess {{the consistency of the}} Eurocode design calculations in regard to reliability. The Eurocode applies the safety format of Partial safety factor (PSF) which assumes a linear Limit state function (LSF). Using NLFEA may result in a non-linear limit state, hence violating the assumption of the PSF method. Still, the Eurocode recommends using the PSF format on non-linear problems when NLFEA are conducted. Current research on concrete structures involves formulating new safety formats that are applicable to NLFEA and non-linear LSFs. This thesis <b>further</b> <b>adapts</b> the current research to the problem of slender columns subject to large second order effects. The reliability is assessed by a response surface method in combination with first and second order reliability methods. Both NLFEA and an analytic approach was used in the probabilistic design. The Monte Carlo method was applied as well to determine the accuracy of the methods. Five random variables were introduced, namely the concrete compressive strength, the reinforcement yield strength, the concrete stiffness, the eccentricity of the load and the load itself. The material and geometric uncertainty have been implemented, while some considerations were made towards the modelling uncertainty. Safety factors applicable to several case configurations were also sought by assessing different concrete grades and column slenderness. Suggestions for improvements in a future version of Eurocode 2 is given. For slender columns, it may seem advantageous to propose a new set of safety factors that are calibrated to consider second order effects. In general, safety factors associated to second order effects should be increased, and safety factors associated to the cross-sectional resistance may be decreased or set to one...|$|E
40|$|In this study, I {{considered}} {{the development of}} mathematical meaning related to the Invertible Matrix Theorem (IMT) for both a classroom community and an individual student over time. In this particular linear algebra course, the IMT was a core theorem in that it connected many concepts fundamental to linear algebra through the notion of equivalency. As the semester progressed, the IMT took form and developed meaning as students came to reason {{about the ways in}} which key ideas involved were connected. As such, the two research questions that guided my dissertation work were : 1. How did the collective classroom community reason about the Invertible Matrix Theorem over time? 2. How did an individual student, Abraham, reason about the Invertible Matrix Theorem over time? Data for this study came from the third iteration of a semester-long classroom teaching experiment (Cobb, 2000) in an inquiry-oriented introductory linear algebra course. Data sources were video and transcript of whole class and small group discussion. To address the second research question, data from two individual semi-structured interviews, as well as written work, were also analyzed. The overarching analytical structure of my methodology was influenced by a framework of genetic analysis through the notion of cultural change, using two interrelated strands of microgenesis and ontogenesis (Saxe, 2002). I utilized two analytical tools, adjacency matrices and Toulmin's Model of argumentation, to analyze the structure of explanations related to the IMT both in isolation and as they shift over time. In addition to an in-depth analysis of the complex ways in which Abraham and the classroom community reasoned about the IMT throughout the semester, this dissertation presents methodological contributions regarding the two analytical tools. First, it necessitates the definition of four new argumentation schemes that are expanded versions of Toulmin's model. Second, it <b>further</b> <b>adapts</b> and refines the use of adjacency matrices within mathematics education research to analyze student thinking, both at static moments and over time. Finally, the present study lays a strong foundation for a 2 -fold analytical coordination. The first coordinates results from adjacency matrix analysis with those from Toulmin's Model to demonstrate they were often compatible, with the tools varying in their respective strengths and limitations. Second, the present study lays a foundation for coordinating the mathematical development of both the individual and the collective units of analysi...|$|E
40|$|On June 11, 2009 the World Health Organization has for {{the first}} time in over 40 years raised its alert status to phase 6 of the {{worldwide}} pandemic alert scale and officially declared Novel Influenza A (H 1 N 1) pandemic. To date (09 - 07 - 09) a total of 94512 cases leading to 429 deaths (CFR= 0. 45 %) have been reported all around the world. Influenza A, a virus belonging to the family of Orthomyxoviridae, is best known for the annual influenza epidemics, usually causing a self-limiting disease characterized by the abrupt onset of fever and chills, accompanied by headache, diffuse myalgia, rhinorrhea, sore throat and cough. However, excess deaths may occur in people with decreased immunity, leading to 0. 5 million estimated deaths per year. For an influenza to become pandemic a process called ‘antigenic shift’ should occur, introducing a new surface haemagglutinin (HA) to which there is no pre-existing herd immunity into the human population. Also a sustained human-to-human transmissibility is required. Transmissibility is reflected by the viral ability to efficiently replicate in the human host and to replicate in the upper respiratory tract to enable viral transmission via the airways. For this purpose, the HA of new influenza strains must be able to recognize α 2, 6 -linked sialic acid, which is widely expressed in the upper human respiratory tract. Factors associated with a high virulence and pathogenicity were indentified in two very pathogenic human influenza strains, namely the 1918 ‘Spanish influenza’ pandemic and H 5 N 1 avian influenza. In both 1918 H 1 N 1 and avian H 5 N 1, virulence appeared to be associated with HA, the viral polymerases and the NS 1 gene, as well as with a deregulated host immune response. Furthermore, all 20 th century pandemics acquired an avian PB 1 segment encoding a working PB 1 -F 2 gene. Compared to 1918 H 1 N 1 and avian H 5 N 1, Novel Influenza A (H 1 N 1) does not seem to possess a lot of pathogenicity factors, as it has a truncated PB 1 -F 2, no pathogenicity-related PB 2 - 627 Lysine and low-pathogenicity amino acids at all known pathogenicity-related positions of the NS 1 segment, arguing in favor of a mildly virulent influenza strain. However, the virus does possess completely new surface proteins, of which haemagglutinin and neuramidase differ 27. 2 % and 18. 2 %, respectively, from the 2008 human H 1 N 1 and to which no pre-existing immunity is expected. The basic reproduction rate, a measure of transmissibility, of Novel Influenza A (H 1 N 1) is estimated between 1. 4 - 1. 6, numbers comparable to the lower estimates of previous pandemics. Therefore, it can be concluded that Novel Influenza A (H 1 N 1) can substantially transmit from human-to-human. How Novel Influenza A (H 1 N 1) will evolve in the coming months, cannot be predicted. The virus has already spread to pandemic proportions and has a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0. 45 %, which is higher than the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. Given the great increase of the human population in the last 50 years, this pandemic may have the potential to take a lot of lives, especially if it <b>further</b> <b>adapts</b> to the new human host. Therefore, sane use of antivirals and the relatively scarce amount of vaccine as well as common sense preventive measures are crucial to confine this pandemic and may save many excess deaths. ...|$|E

The fourth notes for Editor written by Dhirendra SHARMA From University Institute of Information Technology Himachal Pradesh University, INDIA and Vikram SINGH, from Department of Computer Science and Engineering Ch. Devi Lal University, INDIA on ICT In Universities of The Western Himalayan Region In India: Performance Analysis. The paper presents a comparative analysis of a live project study carried out to understand the impact and performance of ICT initiatives taken by the Universities located in the Western Himalayan Region of India. A basic four-tier framework has been used to carry out this study. Accordingly, a pre- structured questionnaire on ICT initiatives, status and accomplishments, 117 questions divided in 18 groups, was prepared and given to the Head of the Department (HOD) of ICT in the Universities, who along with his technical team, supplied the feedback on a five- point scale. In each of the groups, one question was related to performance (as performance indicator) which was identified and thus another special group ‘S’ was created with 18 responses. The first article is from Iran, on “The Utilization of Web-Based Technology As Predictor of Faculty Insights of Support For The Implementation of Elearning” written by Hamed GHAEMI from the University of Tehran, IRAN. This study investigates the level of implementation of web-based instructional technology (WBIT) by the in-teaching faculties of English Language departments as factor related to faculty perception of institutional mechanisms and its partial significance as condition supporting the implementation of e-learning in university education. Using a sample of 160 in-teaching faculties at selected Islamic Azad Universities (IAU) across Iran, faculty perceptions of support mechanisms were examined. The findings of the present study reveal that factors such as stages of apprehension about using WBIT and levels of use offer a justification of the perception variations. Making a profile of faculty WBIT utilization is predicted to provide insight for the development of strategies and administrative practices vital for eLearning to succeed in university education. The Second article is on “Content Analysis Of Research Projects Submitted By Undergraduate Students (2000 - 2009) At The Zimbabwe Open University: Implications for Quality Assessment”, written by Caleb KANGAI, Richard BUKALIYA, Farirai MUSIKA and Mapuranga BABRA From Zimbabwe Open University, ZIMBABWE. This study was part of a series of studies, into issues of quality, currently being conducted at the ZOU by the present authors. The present study aimed at developing a systematic approach towards quality assessment of students’ research work. A content analysis of 400 research projects submitted by ZOU undergraduate students between 2000 - 2009 was undertaken applying both conceptual and relational analysis. Conceptual analysis was based on a checklist of six concepts: research questions, research paradigm, research design, data collection instruments, data form, procedures for data analysis and presentation and sought to establish the status of students’ research work, its gaps and areas of saturation. Relational analysis was conducted {{through the use of a}} model that sought to assess the methodological appropriateness and methodological quality of the research projects. The third articles are from Anadolu University, Turkey. The third one is on “Guiding Students To Answers: Query Recommendation”, conducted by Ozgür YILMAZEL, from Anadolu University, Department of Computer Engineering, Eskisehir, TURKEY. His paper reports on a guided navigation system built on the textbook search engine developed at Anadolu University to support distance education students. The search engine uses Turkish Language specific language processing modules to enable searches over course material presented in Open Education Faculty textbooks. We implemented a guided navigation engine by using query log mining to our application. It makes use of previous users’ sessions to help students find information they are looking for by using fewer queries. We used item-based similarity to do query recommendation. This paper describes the search application, query expansion and evaluation of the system over existing query logs. We show that our system suggested relevant queries with a success rate of 85 %. The 4 th article arrived from GREECE, which is prepared on “Blogs In Distance Education: An Analysis of Physical Educators’ Perceptions of Learning”, written by Maria MAHERIDOU, Panagiotis ANTONIOU, Thomas KOURTESSIS and Andreas AVGERINOS from Department of Physical Education and Sport Science Democritus University of Thrace, GREECE. The purpose of this study was to examine the physical educators’ perception of learning toward three blog courses, carrying on during an eight week period, in order to enhance their professional development and their skills in effective teaching. In each blog a different cooperative teaching method was applied (STAND, COOP and ICL). Participants were fifty four (n= 54) physical educators who teach in elementary and secondary schools of different Greek regions, with an experience of 1. 67 to 21. 75 years.

The seventh article titled as “Pre-Service Students’ Class Standings and Their Perceptions of Distance Education”, written by Allan E. YOUNG, Teacher Education Department, College of Business at the University CAYMAN ISLANDS (UCCI). The study revealed that pre-service teachers at the beginning stage of their program were significantly more satisfied, overall, with distance courses and programs, than those at the end of their program. Students near the beginning and middle of their program rated grading and timely return of assignments, a sense of accomplishment, and willingness to take additional distance courses, significantly higher than those who were at the end of their program. However, the opportunity to know others in the distance class, although rated low, was higher for students at the end of their program. The study revealed that those in education should plan programs that will address the idiosyncrasies at all levels, thereby resulting in satisfaction on the part of student teachers. The eight article is come from Malaysia. Titled article is on “Students’ Decision Steps In Meta-Cognitive Learning in Free Online Groups (METAL-FROG) : A Case Study”, written by Kinsley Ng SEN FA, School of Social Sciences, University Science Malaysia and Firuz Hussin from Department of Instructional Technology Faculty of Education, University University Malaya, MALAYSIA. This paper only presents a part of the findings under the pro-learning behaviors sub-theory. We found striking similarities between the model proposed by latane & darley (1971), five essential steps to a pro-social response in an emergency, and our research subject. The model which explains the course of a pro-social decision was borrowed and modified as surrogate theory to explain the online discussion response of the students. The insights help educators to better understand what holds students back from fruitful online peer diologic discussion. The 9 th article is arrived to us from Greece and written by George S. MOUZAKITIS from e-Learning Think Tank Team, GREECE and Nazime TUNCAY, from Near East University, Nicosia. NORTH CYPRUS TURKISH REPUBLIC on “E-LEARNING and Lifelong Learning”.

Article is entitled as “Investigating Agricultural Instructors' Attitudes Toward E-Learning in Iran”, written by Davoud MOHAMMADI, Seyed Mahmoud HOSSEINI and Hossein Shabanali FAMI From Department of Agricultural Extension and Education, College of Agricultural Economics and Development, University of Tehran, IRAN. The purpose of this study is to explore agricultural instructors’ attitudes toward e-learning usage. A descriptive–correlation survey approach was used in this study. Accordingly, 175 instructors in 64 agricultural education centers are asked to answer questionnaires for investigating their attitudes. Data were collected by mailing the questionnaire. After statistical analysis, the results demonstrate that instructors have positive attitude toward using e-learning as a teaching assisted tool. Intrinsic incentives and motivators for acceptance of e-learning are important than extrinsic incentives and motivators. Based on the findings, this research proposes guidelines for developing e-learning environments in agricultural education. In article 11 mention about “The “Community Services” Course Through Distance Education: Evaluation of Primary School Students”, written by A. Nurhan SAKAR and Oznur OZTURK, from Anadolu University, Open Education Faculty, Eskisehir, TURKEY. Their article mention that following the Bologna Process, Turkish Council of Higher Education (YÖK) adopted a resolution and changed the curriculum of teacher training higher education institutions. This curriculum revision introduced a new course called ‘Community Service’ which aims to raise students’ awareness of their responsibilities as individuals to the community in which they live. Through this course, students are expected to realize individuals can make a difference by volunteering to share their knowledge and skills with the community. This study presents one application of Community Service course. This application is of interest because it was researched whether the course achieved its aim by evaluating the satisfaction level of primary school students at whose schools English survey courses given within the scope of Open Education Faculty Distance English Language Teaching (DELT) Program. Article 12 was about ”Managerial Perception of Education in The Educational Non-Governmental Organizations”, written by Mehmet Metin ARSLAN, from Kirikkale University, TURKEY. The aim of this research is to determine the educational NGO managers’ perceptions of education and distance education in the city of Kırıkkale. The sample of this qualitative research, which has been conducted on a case pattern basis, comprises managers from 13 educational non-governmental organizations in the province of Kırıkkale. Data were collected by the researcher himself through direct contact and interview with the participants. The interview form was developed based on the opinions from experts in the field. The concordance between the sentential codifications was checked by an independent observer and the researcher in order to ensure data reliability. The last but not least article 13 again from Anadolu Universiy. On “Opinions Of Elementary Level EFL Learners on The Use Of Weblogs”, written by Ilknur ISTIFCI, Anadolu University, The School of Foreign Languages, Eskisehir, TURKEY. The aim of this study is to find the opinions of elementary level EFL learners on using weblogs and distance education. The subjects of the study were 10 Native speakers of English in London and 15 Turkish EFL learners who are learning English in the School of Foreign Languages. Turkish EFL learners created a class blog and every week they were given assignments by their class teacher. They wrote paragraphs and they gave and receive feedback on their writing in terms of content, vocabulary and grammar by their classmates and by native English speakers in a virtual environment. This procedure lasted for 6 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks, students were given an evaluation questionnaire and they were asked to write their opinions about using weblogs. They were also interviewed by their teacher and the opinions of the students were categorized. Findings indicate that the students found the idea of weblogs as a distant learning tool motivating, enjoyable and encouraging. Two books are reviewed in this issue. The first book was about “Instructional Design For Teachers: Improving classroom practice” written by Alison A. Carr-Chellman, reviewed by Reviewed by Reviewed by Yavuz Akbulut, Anadolu University, TURKEY. Instructional design for teachers (ID 4 T) provides us and particularly K- 12 teachers with a practical instructional design model. The contents of the book guide the readers through step by step and easy-to-use directions with an emphasis on encouraging current and effective us of ID principles. The application of the model is not too highly analytical and detailed, which protects the teacher from losing sight of the overall learning context. The illustrated ID process <b>further</b> <b>adapts</b> the classroom teachers to more learner-centered implementations through framing questions, common errors, relevant heuristics and examples. These can also help classroom teachers to be more cognizant of learner diversity in formal educational settings whose learning outcomes are predetermined by authorities that are beyond the reach of classroom teachers and learners. The second book is about “Educational Technology In Practice Research and Practical Case Studies from the Field” edited by Edited by Wanjira KINUTHIA and Steward MARSHALL and reviewed by Ozden SAHIN-IZMIRLI, Computer Education and Instructional Technology, Dear readers, you can reach us online either directly at [URL] or by visiting Anadolu University homepage at [URL] from English version, clicking on Scientific Research button and than goes to the Referred Journals.

As an older person ages, their interaction requirements may change over time, AALFI allows for the older person requirements to be <b>further</b> <b>adapted</b> to take into account these changes so that they may continue to receive assistance. Who carries out these changes is also flexible as either the older person or primary care provider may make these changes at any time.|$|R

Some {{of the national}} questionnaires were <b>further</b> <b>adapted</b> to account for specific country characteristics and differences in institutional framework. As a result, some countries opted for shorter versions of surveys, while others extended them in several dimensions.|$|R
