The Raman spectra, recorded as a function of position along the tunnel direction and as a function of time, demonstrate that the transport process is associated with a significant change in the conformational properties of the original (1, 8 -dibromooctane) <b>guest</b> <b>molecules.</b> In particular, in the boundary region between the original and new <b>guest</b> <b>molecules,</b> there is a substantial increase in the proportion of 1, 8 -dibromooctane <b>guest</b> <b>molecules</b> that have the gauche end-group conformation.

50|$|The {{structure}} of coordination polymers often incorporates empty {{space in the}} form of pores or channels. This empty space is thermodynamically unfavorable. In order to stabilize the structure and prevent collapse, the pores or channels are often occupied by guest molecules. Guest molecules do not form bonds with the surrounding lattice, but sometimes interact via intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonding or pi stacking. Most often, the <b>guest</b> <b>molecule</b> will be the solvent that the coordination polymer was crystallized in, but can really be anything (other salts present, atmospheric gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc.) The presence of the <b>guest</b> <b>molecule</b> can sometimes influence the structure by supporting a pore or channel, where otherwise none would exist.|$|E

From the J–V characteristics of these OLEDs, we find two important results: (1) J–V characteristics of the OLEDs are controlled by the direct hole injection from the neighboring HTL to <b>guest</b> <b>molecules,</b> and (2) HOMO level alignment between the HTL and <b>guest</b> <b>molecules</b> provides efficient hole injection at this interface...|$|R

The recently discovered epsilon phase of s-PS is characterized by channel-shaped cavities crossing the unit cells along the c axis, rather than by isolated cavities as observed for the already known delta phase. Guest sorption from the delta and epsilon nanoporous phases eventually leads to two different classes of polymer co-crystals, where planar <b>guest</b> <b>molecules</b> present their planes roughly perpendicular and parallel to the polymer chain axes.

50|$|An {{important}} {{implication of}} encapsulating a molecule {{at this level}} is that the guest is prevented from contacting other molecules that it might otherwise react with. Thus the encapsulated molecule behaves very differently from the way it would when in solution. The <b>guest</b> <b>molecule</b> tends to be extremely unreactive and often has much different spectroscopic signatures. Compounds normally highly unstable in solution, such as arynes or cycloheptatetraene, have been successfully isolated at room temperature when molecularly encapsulated.|$|E

50|$|Nonpolar {{molecules}} such as methane {{can form}} clathrate hydrates with water, especially under high pressure. Although {{there is no}} hydrogen bonding of water molecules when methane is the <b>guest</b> <b>molecule</b> of the clathrate, guest-host hydrogen bonding often forms with guest molecules in clathrates of many larger organic molecules, such as pinacolone and tetrahydrofuran. In such cases the guest-host hydrogen bonds result {{in the formation of}} L-type Bjerrum defect in the clathrate lattice. Oxygen atoms (in alcohol or carbonyl functional groups) and nitrogen atoms (in amine functional groups) in the guest molecules lead to transient hydrogen bonds and misoriented water molecules in the hydrate lattice.|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} of the inclusion compounds greatly modifies the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the <b>guest</b> <b>molecule,</b> mostly in terms of water solubility. This is the reason why cyclodextrins have attracted much interest in many fields, especially pharmaceutical applications: because inclusion compounds of cyclodextrins with hydrophobic molecules are able to penetrate body tissues, these can be used to release biologically active compounds under specific conditions. In most cases the mechanism of controlled degradation of such complexes is based on pH change of water solutions, leading to the loss of hydrogen or ionic bonds between the host and the guest molecules. Alternative means for the disruption of the complexes take advantage of heating or action of enzymes able to cleave α-1,4 linkages between glucose monomers.|$|E
50|$|A supramolecular host could bind to a <b>guest</b> <b>molecule</b> {{in such a}} {{way that}} the guest’s labile group is {{positioned}} close to the reactive group of the host. The proximity of the two groups enhances the probability that the reaction could occur and thus the reaction rate is increased. This concept is similar to the principle of preorganization which states that complexation could be improved if the binding motifs are preorganized in a well-defined position so that the host does not require any major conformational change for complexation. In this case, the catalyst is preorganized such that no major conformational changes is required for the reaction to occur. A notable example of catalysts that employ this mechanism is Jean-Marie Lehn's crown ether. In addition, catalysts based on functionalized cyclodextrins often employ this mode of catalysis.|$|E
40|$|In this article, we {{describe}} the introduction of amphiphilic beta-cyclodextrins into liposomes to act as artificial receptor units. Using dynamic light scattering, dye encapsulation, and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, we show that amphiphilic beta-cyclodextrins can be mixed in any proportion with a typical mixture of phospholipids and cholesterol to provide stable, spherical, and unilamellar mixed vesicles. It is also possible to form giant unilamellar, vesicles with mixtures of lipids and cyclodextrin. The permeability of the mixed vesicles increases with the percentage of cyclodextrin. The cyclodextrins can act as host <b>molecules</b> for hydrophobic <b>guest</b> <b>molecules,</b> {{even when they are}} dispersed at a low percentage in the vesicle membrane. It is shown that mixed vesicles can be decorated with carbohydrate-functionalized <b>guest</b> <b>molecules,</b> with photoresponsive <b>guest</b> <b>molecules,</b> and with dye-functionalized <b>guest</b> <b>molecules.</b> Taken together, it is demonstrated that the host guest chemistry of amphiphilic cyclodextrins is fully compatible with a liposomal bilayer membrane and the advantages of each can be combined to give superior nanocontainers. ...|$|R

It was found that diffuse s-layers, which are due to weak lateral correlations of the <b>guest</b> <b>molecules,</b> are not sharp parallel c* at room temperature as assumed previously, but show a broadening of their widths with increasing order. With decreasing temperature the widths of the s-layers decrease and become sharp within the resolution limit at very low temperature, i. e. there is an ordering of the <b>guest</b> <b>molecules</b> along the urea host tunnels. The modulations of the s-layers point towards a lateral correlation of the <b>guest</b> <b>molecules</b> at room temperature which can be described by a box-shaped distribution function. A model is described which explains the existence of (numerous) satellite reflections and satellite s-layers at low temperatures. Some of the satellites are also observable at room temperature in inclusion compounds with <b>guest</b> <b>molecules</b> longer than tetradecane.
