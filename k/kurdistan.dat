5|$|Under American protection, Iraqi <b>Kurdistan</b> {{had evolved}} into a {{successful}} semi-autonomous region. US pressure helped lead to a peace deal in 1999 between the major Iraqi Kurdish factions, the Patriotic Union of <b>Kurdistan</b> and the <b>Kurdistan</b> Democratic Party of Iraq. While both parties officially swore off independence, the Turkish government remained sufficiently concerned, and continued to keep troops in northern Iraq.|$|E

5|$|In Baghdad, {{given the}} lack of firm and public {{leadership}} by Mirza Yahya, the Babi community had fallen into disarray. Some Babis, including Bahá'u'lláh's family, began searching for Bahá'u'lláh, and when news of a man living in the mountains under the name of Darvish Muhammad spread to neighboring areas, Bahá'u'lláh's family begged him to come back to Baghdad. On 19 March 1856, after two years in <b>Kurdistan</b> he returned to Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|The Kurdish {{geographical}} name changes were exempt under the Ottoman Empire {{due to the}} Islamic religious orientation of Kurds. During the Republican era and especially after the Dersim massacre, Kurdish {{geographical name}} changes became more common. During the Turkish Republican era, the words <b>Kurdistan</b> and Kurds were banned. The Turkish government had disguised {{the presence of the}} Kurds statistically by categorizing them as Mountain Turks. This classification was changed to the new euphemism of Eastern Turk in 1980.|$|E

5|$|For two years, Bahá'u'lláh {{lived alone}} in the {{mountains}} of <b>Kurdistan.</b> He originally lived as a hermit, dressed like a dervish and used the name Darvish Muhammad-i-Irani. At one point someone noticed his penmanship, which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local Sufi orders. As he began to take guests, he became noted for his learning and wisdom. Shaykh `Uthmán, Shaykh `Abdu'r-Rahmán, and Shaykh Ismá'íl, leaders of the Naqshbandíyyih, Qádiríyyih, and Khálidíyyih Orders respectively, began to seek his advice. It was to the second of these that the Four Valleys was written. Bahá'u'lláh wrote several other notable books during this time.|$|E
