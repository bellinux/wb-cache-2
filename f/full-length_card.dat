50|$|The Revolution series were large, <b>full-length</b> <b>cards</b> {{that ranged}} {{in price from}} $1995 to $2995 at introduction.|$|R
50|$|The EXOPC is also {{equipped}} with an accelerometer, which lets the display change from a portrait mode to a landscape mode by turning the slate in either direction. Internally it has four mini-PCIe slots of which three provide space for <b>full-length</b> <b>cards</b> and one half length. Three of these slots are in use and the fourth is available, but intended for a WWAN card. The unit also provides a SIM card slot.|$|R
5000|$|MS-DOS 2.11, DeskMate 1.0, and a {{keyboard}} {{with the same}} layout as the Tandy 2000's were included with the computer. Like the PCjr, the Tandy 1000 motherboard did not supply DMA, but unlike that system, it could have DMA added with a memory expansion board. While the Tandy 1000 had three XT-compatible expansion slots, early Tandy memory upgrade boards took up two of the slots to get to 640 KB. Because the slots were [...] inches in length instead of the PC's 13 inches, <b>full-length</b> <b>cards</b> did not fit, but reviewers noted that the many built-in hardware features reduced the need for cards.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} AST version {{consists of}} a pair of <b>full-length</b> NuBus <b>cards,</b> joined by two ribbon cables. The first board {{consists of a}} CPU card while the second board acts as a disk controller and memory card.|$|R
50|$|However, {{installing}} the G5Jam removes {{the ability to}} put <b>full-length</b> PCI <b>cards</b> {{in the first three}} PCI slots. The fourth PCI/AGP slot is still left open. It gives the possibility of a 2 terabyte volume with speeds up to 200 mb per second.|$|R
5000|$|The {{machine was}} built {{up from the}} {{backplane}} mounted {{on the right-hand side}} panel of the case, with ten 50-pin card slots. The first and last slots were spaced differently from the rest. Also, the power supplies occupied some of the space needed for the last (which meant that the last card not only had to accommodate the narrow spacing but also could not be full-length), leaving eight [...] "standard" [...] slots available for <b>full-length</b> <b>cards.</b> The front panel plugged into the first slot and the CPU plugged into the second, leaving seven for further expansion. The card slots were arranged on an angle, which allowed the case to be reduced in height. Each card contained its own voltage regulators, using the Z-shaped mounting bracket as a heat-sink. (Power distribution on the backplane was unregulated +8V and +/-18V; the cards regulated these to their requirements, typically +5V and +/- 12V.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Multisound Pinnacle - same as Multisound Fiji {{but with}} {{additional}} specifications : <b>full-length</b> ISA <b>card,</b> hardware sample-based synthesis (Kurzweil/HOMAC Synth Engine), 4 MB patch set (2 MB sample ROM - using proprietary Kurzweil compression), user expandable sample Set (supports up to 48 MB of Sample RAM on board, using two 32 bits SIMM sockets for FPM RAM), EIDE CD-ROM Interface.|$|R
50|$|The small 7 * 7 * 7 in cube, {{suspended}} in a 7.65 * 7.65 * 10 in acrylic glass enclosure, housed a PowerPC G4 processor running at 450 or 500 MHz, {{and had a}} unique, slot-loading, low-profile DVD-ROM or CD-RW drive. A separate monitor, with either an ADC or a VGA connection, was required for the Cube, {{in contrast to the}} all-in-one iMac series. Also unlike the iMacs, it had a video card in a standard AGP slot. However, there was not enough space for <b>full-length</b> <b>cards.</b> The Cube also featured two FireWire 400 ports and two USB 1.1 ports for connecting peripherals. The Cube is exceptional as the only Macintosh without a built-in speaker (as of 2016). Sound was provided by an external USB amplifier and a pair of Harman Kardon speakers. Although the USB amplifier had a standard mini-plug headphone output, it lacked any audio input. The Cube also used a silent, fanless, convection-based cooling system like the iMacs of the time.|$|R
50|$|The {{video output}} for the Magnum R4000 {{consists}} of a proprietary framebuffer available as a custom <b>full-length</b> option <b>card</b> â€” the G364 framebuffer. The G364 includes a SUN 13W3-style output (which {{can be converted to}} the more common VGA pin-out), and is capable of pixel screen resolutions of 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, or 1280x1024. Because it is a simple framebuffer, the G364 does not include any accelerated graphics functions.|$|R
50|$|Released in March 1994, the Sound Blaster AWE32 (Advanced Wave Effects) {{introduced}} an all new MIDI synthesizer section {{based on the}} EMU8000. The AWE32 consisted of two distinct audio sections; the Creative digital audio section (audio codec, optional CSP/ASP chip socket, Yamaha OPL3), and the E-mu MIDI synthesizer section. The synthesizer section consisted of the EMU8000 sampler and effects processor, an EMU8011 1 MB sample ROM, and 512 KB of sample RAM (expandable to 28 MB). To fit the new hardware, the AWE32 was a <b>full-length</b> ISA <b>card,</b> measuring 14 in.|$|R
50|$|The Sound Blaster AWE32 is an ISA {{sound card}} from Creative Technology. It is an {{expansion}} board for PCs and {{is part of}} the Sound Blaster family of products. The Sound Blaster AWE32, introduced in March 1994, was a near <b>full-length</b> ISA sound <b>card,</b> measuring 14 inches (356 mm) in length, due to the number of features included.|$|R
50|$|The Roland LAPC-I is a {{sound card}} for IBM PC {{compatible}} computers produced by Roland Corporation. It basically consists of a MT-32-compatible Roland CM-32L and a MPU-401 unit, integrated onto a single <b>full-length</b> 8-bit ISA <b>card.</b> In addition to normal Roland dealers aimed at musicians, it was distributed in the United States by Sierra On-Line in 1989 for use with the company's games. The MSRP of the card was around US$425.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "VLB slot" [...] {{itself was}} simply an {{additional}} edge connector placed in-line {{with the traditional}} ISA or EISA connector, with this extended portion often colored a distinctive brown. The result was a normal ISA or EISA slot being additionally capable of accepting VLB-compatible cards. Traditional ISA cards remained compatible as {{they would not have}} pins past the normal ISA or EISA portion of the slot. The reverse was also true VLB cards were by necessity quite long in order to reach the VLB connector, and were reminiscent of older <b>full-length</b> expansion <b>cards</b> from the earlier IBM XT era. Ironically, the VLB portion of a slot looked similar to an IBM MCA slot, as indeed it was the same physical 116-pin connector used by MCA cards, rotated by 180 degrees. The IBM MCA standard had not been as popular as IBM expected and there was an ample surplus of the connector, making it inexpensive and readily available.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} <b>full-length</b> full-height PCI <b>card</b> (also {{known as}} full-size) is specified as {{a length of}} 312mm (12.283inches) and a height of 107mm (4.2inches). However, most modern PCI cards are half-length or smaller (see below) and many modern PC cases cannot accommodate {{the length of a}} full-size card. Note, this length is the length of the printed circuit board; it does not include the angled short leg of the metal bracket (which does affect e.g. packaging dimensions). Some high power PCI products have active cooling systems that extend past the nominal dimensions. Likewise, some may take up more than one slot space: these are referred to as double-wide or triple-wide cards, accordingly.|$|R
5000|$|Multisound Classic - was a 430 USD <b>full-length</b> ISA sound <b>card</b> {{produced}} from 1991 to 1994. It contained an EMU Proteus 1/XR professional MIDI rack engine with 2 MB or 4 MB ROM sample pack and a Motorola 56001 / 68000 DSP chip pair for wave recording and playback. The card supported Windows 9x officially {{and can be}} used on Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 using Peter Hall's drivers. The sound quality and feature set offered by MultiSound Classic was truly revolutionary at the time, but Creative Labs acquired EMU in 1994 and the supply of XR chips stopped. The card had to be redesigned accordingly, creating the Tahiti. A detailed analysis of the MultiSound's hardware is here ...|$|R
5000|$|Creative Computing {{called the}} {{original}} Tandy 1000 [...] "the machine IBM was too inept, incapable, or afraid to manufacture. It {{is sure to}} put a whopping dent not only into PCjr sales, but into sales of the PC 'senior' as well", favorably mentioning its low price, good PC-software compatibility, and bundled DeskMate ("you might never need another software package for your computer"). InfoWorld noted the 1000's low price ("fully one-third less than a comparably equipped IBM PC"), predicted that the computer was really intended for [...] "the elusive home computer market", and speculated that [...] "in retrospect {{it might have been}} the PCjr's final straw". The magazine called the 1000 [...] "almost as fully IBM PC compatible as a computer can get", but gave DeskMate a mixed review and advised customers of the computer's inability to use <b>full-length</b> PC expansion <b>cards.</b> It concluded that [...] "By making the 1000 inexpensive and adaptable" [...] and including DeskMate, [...] "Tandy produced a real home computer".|$|R
