5|$|In a {{statement}} on its website, ReactOS cited differing legal definitions of what constitutes clean-room reverse engineering as a cause for the conflict. Some countries, including the United States, require that a reimplementation based on disassembled code must be written by someone other than the person having disassembled and examined the original code, whereas other countries allow both tasks to be performed by the same individual. Consequently, ReactOS clarified that its <b>Intellectual</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Policy</b> Statement requirements on clean room reverse engineering conform to US law. An internal source code audit was conducted to ensure that only clean room reverse engineering was used, and all developers were made to sign an agreement committing them {{to comply with the}} project's policies on reverse engineering. Contributors to its development were not affected by these events, and all access to the software development tools was restored shortly afterward. In September 2007, with the audit nearing completion, the audit status was removed from the ReactOS homepage. Though the audit was completed, specific details were not made public as it was only an internal effort to ensure compliance with the project's own policies.|$|E

This thesis sought to understand how the <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> <b>policies</b> and commercialization initiatives at research universities affect their commercialization activities and intensity. The ability of universities to engage in commercialization activities is dependent on the willingness of the researchers to disclose their inventions. We used cross-sectional data from AUTM (Association of University Technology Managers) and other sources to evaluate the effect universities <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> <b>policies</b> and other factors on faculty willingness to disclose their inventions and discoveries. The research revealed that universities' commercialization efforts have been intensifying over the years and across the institution. <b>Intellectual</b> <b>property</b> <b>policies</b> were found to have insignificant effect on the number of disclosures. This supports earlier research that has shown many faculty members were ignorant about such policies. On the other hand, licensing revenue, which basically goes to fund future research, was a very significant factor in disclosures and hence commercialization initiatives at universities...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{technology}} {{has changed the}} manner in which educational courses are delivered in postsecondary education. Currently, many courses are presented through an electronic medium, often referred to as “distance education. ” The emergence of distance education, however, raises several legal issues regarding <b>intellectual</b> <b>property.</b> Of particular interest and debate is the ownership of distance education courseworks. ^ Currently, there are several references on <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> ownership, however, little is known specifically regarding the ownership rights to distance education courseworks and how university <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> <b>policies</b> affect these rights. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to provide a comprehensive legal analysis of the ownership rights to distance education courseworks under current copyright law and through the use of <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> <b>policies.</b> ^ The research of this dissertation consisted primarily of an analysis of current copyright principles as they relate directly to postsecondary education. These principles were then applied to a spectrum of institutional <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> <b>policies</b> to determine how universities may internally modify or assign ownership rights to distance education courseworks. ^ The significance of this dissertation is that it: (1) improves the current literature base on <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> ownership rights in postsecondary education, (2) indexes the continuum of ownership outcomes of distance education courseworks found within institutional <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> <b>policies,</b> and (3) provides a reference for university administrators and faculty members engaged in the negotiation of the assignment or modification of <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> rights. ^ The results of this dissertation indicate that there is no definitive ownership rule for distance education courseworks. Under current copyright law, ownership rights are speculative at best. Despite this uncertainty, however, universities may nonetheless dictate, modify, or even assign ownership of distance education courseworks directly to the institution, faculty, or other persons, via a well-crafted institutional policy or contract. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> <b>policies</b> of 42 public and private Carnegie Doctoral Research – Extensive Universities. Using a policy analysis framework based on earlier work by Lape (1992) and Packard (2001), policy differences between public and private universities and policy changes across time were analyzed and documented. Although few differences were seen between public and private research universities, substantial changes between the 2001 policies and the 2005 policies were evident. Results were interpreted in terms of the need for comprehensive and explicit policies to support online course development and delivery. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate current <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> <b>policies</b> of doctoral research universities with respect to online course materials. As the proliferation of distance-learning opportunities continues in this era of educational accountability, educators, administrators, and institutions will need to insure that institutional policies protect and support an environment that foster...|$|R

40|$|In Wilson and Gray the {{respective}} university <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> <b>policies</b> {{were held to}} be ineffective. The Federal Court therefore had to examine the default law concerning academic ownership of inventions. The trial judge in Wilson accepted that inventions that were a normal incident {{of the kind of}} research a particular academic was engaged to perform may belong to the employing university. However, French J and the Full Court in Gray emphasised that academic autonomy, duty to publish and freedom to collaborate with outsiders set academics apart. Employer ownership of inventions is therefore not to be implied into standard academic employment contracts, which are of a separate kind. A duty to research does not equate to a duty to further the university 2 ̆ 7 s commercial interests by pursuing patentable inventions, as is by contrast required of researchers in industry.
