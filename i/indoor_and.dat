5|$|The Shrines of Ise {{have been}} celebrated as the {{prototype}} of Japanese architecture.

The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese aesthetics and adaptation of imported ideas.|$|E
5|$|The years {{following}} World War I were severely testing {{for the owners}} of many great estates. The staff both <b>indoor</b> <b>and</b> outdoor, which had previously been plentiful, essential, and cheap, were now in short supply. Millions of men had left private service to join the army, and very few returned. Female domestic staff had been called up for war service in factories, and now realised there was an easier and better paid existence outside of {{the gates of the}} great country houses.

5|$|To {{increase}} their incomes, many farmers have diversified; {{the average income}} from non-farming business activities on farms in Wales in 2013/2014 was £4,900.

Caravans, camp sites and parking provide alternative uses for land, and wind turbines can provide extra income from land still farmed in the normal way.|$|E
30|$|Sea-based mesocosms might yield more {{potential}} to use many replicates than land <b>and</b> <b>indoor</b> facilities, <b>and</b> therefore a better statistical {{evaluation of the}} results. Sea/lake-based mesocosms are often inexpensive, at least compared to the <b>indoor</b> variant, <b>and</b> provide better opportunities for a natural light environment. The negative characteristics of sea/lake-based mesocosms compared to land <b>and</b> <b>indoor</b> facilities are their sensitivity to weather conditions and very restricted potential to control light, temperature and turbulent mixing, whereas the ability to adjust nutrients, pH and food-web structure is approximately {{the same as for}} the land-based <b>and</b> <b>indoor</b> counterparts.|$|R
