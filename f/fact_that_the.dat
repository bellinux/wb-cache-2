5|$|Alarmed at {{the popular}} appeal of Paine's Rights of Man, the king issued a {{proclamation}} against seditious writings in May 1792. Booksellers and printers bore {{the brunt of}} this law, the effects of which {{came to a head}} in the 1794 Treason Trials. Johnson testified, publicly distancing himself from Paine and Barlow, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> defendants were received sympathetically by the juries.|$|E
5|$|Alsos teams {{rounded up}} German {{scientists}} including Kurt Diebner, Otto Hahn, Walther Gerlach, Werner Heisenberg, and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, who {{were taken to}} England where they were interned at Farm Hall, a bugged house in Godmanchester. After the bombs were detonated in Japan, the Germans were forced to confront the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Allies had done what they could not.|$|E
5|$|Another {{purpose for}} issuing the edict {{might have been}} related to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{periphery}} of the empire was now becoming central to its existence, and the granting of citizenship may have been simply a logical outcome of Rome's continued expansion of citizenship rights.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 16th century, Europeans' {{interest}} in the New World revolved around gold and silver and not tobacco. The European lack of interest in tobacco was due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Amerindians controlled the tobacco industry; as long as the Amerindians controlled the supply there was no need for the incorporation in European commercial capitalism.|$|E
5|$|Each canton is {{controlled}} by a government unit called Municipalidad. The term reflects the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cantons in Costa Rica have approximately the same function as municipios ("municipalities") in many other Spanish-speaking countries. This administrative unit consists of two bodies: a municipal executive (Concejo Municipal) and an executive body which only consists of a mayor (alcalde / alcaldesa municipal), a title that was introduced in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Extremists will {{probably}} deplore the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> composer {{is still a}} respecter of form, still a devotee of beauty, still a believer in the potency of melody; but this is rather a matter for congratulation than regret...

50|$|It is {{precisely}} for this wide-ranging variety of possible <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reasonable person standard is so broad (and often confusing {{and difficult to}} apply). However, a few general areas of relevant circumstances rise above the others.|$|R
5|$|In this case, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{value on}} the left of OR is unknowable is irrelevant, because {{the outcome of the}} OR {{operation}} would be True regardless of the {{value on the}} left.|$|E
