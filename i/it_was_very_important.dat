25|$|Many {{conflicts}} {{that result in}} harm and death involve status, reputation, and seemingly trivial insults. Steven Pinker in his book The Blank Slate argues that in non-state societies without a police <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> to have a credible deterrence against aggression. Therefore, {{it was important to}} be perceived as having a credible reputation for retaliation, resulting in humans to develop instincts for revenge as well as for protecting reputation ("honor"). Pinker argues that the development {{of the state and the}} police have dramatically reduced the level of violence compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.|$|E

[...] These committees included housing and maintenance, venue construction, finances, and media and advertising. [...] The local committees worked very closely with the Swiss federal government and the IOC to ensure that the organization of the Games proceeded without hindrance. [...] Since no athletes' village existed from the previous Games, the athletes and officials were housed in hotels around the city. [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> for the committees to draw upon their experiences from the 1928 Olympics. [...] Their selection of locations for the various events was contingent on the weather conditions as all the events were held outdoors.|$|E

500|$|Prior {{to writing}} the script, Arndt {{read in a}} {{newspaper}} about Arnold Schwarzenegger speaking {{to a group of}} high school students and saying [...] "If there's one thing in this world I hate, it's losers. I despise them." [...] As a result, Arndt developed his script lampooning the thought process: [...] "And I thought there's something so wrong with that attitude... I wanted to... attack that idea that in life you're going up or you're going down... So to a degree a child beauty pageant is the epitome of the ultimate stupid meaningless competition people put themselves through." [...] Co-director Jonathan Dayton also commented on the importance of the pageant to the film: [...] "As far as the pageant goes, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> to us that the film not be about pageants. It's about being out of place, it's about not knowing where you're going to end up..." ...|$|E
500|$|Whether Ceawlin is a {{descendant}} of Cerdic {{is a matter of}} debate. [...] Subgroupings of different West Saxon lineages give the impression of separate groups, of which Ceawlin's line is one. [...] Some of the problems in the Wessex genealogies may have come about because of efforts to integrate Ceawlin's line with the other lineages: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> to the West Saxons to be able to trace their ancestors back to Cerdic. [...] Another reason for doubting the literal nature of these early genealogies is that the etymology of the names of several early members of the dynasty {{do not appear to be}} Germanic, as would be expected in the names of leaders of an apparently Anglo-Saxon dynasty. [...] The name Ceawlin is one of the names that do not have convincing Anglo-Saxon etymologies; it seems more likely to be of native British origin.|$|E

He noted that some songs were [...] "very atmospheric" [...] while others maintained [...] "the hard rock and the heavy stuff". Jon Wiederhorn of MTV said that [...] "for every thrash riff there's a tunefully grungy passage, for every flailing guitar line there's a rock-radio hook." [...] When talking about the track [...] "30/30-150", he said parts are [...] "bludgeoning, barbed and heavy" [...] while others are [...] "soaring and triumphant" [...] with the production of Raskulinecz helping to balance the album's heaviness with its radio-accessibility. Come What(ever) Mays lyrics include themes of [...] "pain, pleasure, happiness, and grief". The diversity in subjects is evident throughout the album; songs including [...] "Come What(ever) May" [...] were politically influenced while the track [...] "Socio" [...] is about [...] "social anxiety attacks" [...] that Taylor suffered. [...] "Zzyzx Rd" [...] is a love song written to Taylor's wife for helping him in his struggles against alcoholism and contemplation of suicide. [...] "I've never written anything like that before, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> for me to tell the world not only how much she saved me, but how much she means to me," [...] said Taylor. Taylor said there is a common thread with the lyrics throughout the album, saying that they are [...] "about never forgetting where you came from, who you are and why you do this." ...|$|E

500|$|Fincher and Zaillian's central {{objective}} was to maintain the novel's setting. To portray Larsson's vision of Sweden, and the interaction of light on its landscape, Fincher cooperated with an artistic team that included cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and production designer Donald Graham Burt. The film was wholly shot using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED MX digital camera, chosen to help evoke Larsson's tone. The idea, according to Cronenweth, was to employ unorthodox light sources and maintain a realistic perspective. [...] "So there may be shadows, there may be flaws, but it's reality. You allow silhouettes and darkness, {{but at the same}} time we also wanted shots to counter that, so it would not all be one continuous dramatic image." [...] Sweden's climate was a crucial element in enhancing the mood. Cronenweth commented, [...] "It's always an element in the background and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> that you feel it as an audience member. The winter becomes like a silent character in the film giving everything a low, cool-colored light that is super soft and non-direct." [...] To get acquainted with Swedish culture, Burt set out on a month-long expedition across the country. He said of the process, [...] "It takes time to start really taking in the nuances of a culture, to start seeing the themes that recur in the architecture, the landscape, the layouts of the cities and the habits of the people. I felt I had to really integrate myself into this world to develop a true sense of place for the film. It was not just about understanding the physicality of the locations, but the metaphysics of them, and how the way people live comes out through design." ...|$|E
500|$|The New 52 ongoing {{series are}} {{organized}} under seven different [...] "families," [...] grouping similar characters or themes within the books together. By {{the release of}} the October 2013 solicitations, DC was no longer grouping the titles by these families. They instead began releasing one larger solicit, titled [...] "The New 52 Group". However, titles that were not participating in an event for the month, such as [...] "Forever Evil", were still grouped together in the larger solicit by the previous family headings. In September 2014, DC co-publisher Dan DiDio spoke about classifying the titles into the families, saying, [...] "one of the things we did, when we launched the New 52, we broke those classifications up {{in a way that we}} were able to draw attention to all the characters. So we put them in groupings so we would be able to promote and help them draw attention in groups. It was never made to be a certain amount different stuff. We always want to have different styles of product... with a lot of characters, we're careful. Things like Frankenstein and Grifter and Voodoo and things of that nature, which were really risky characters and risky chances for us to take, and we're very happy to do them. Even though they didn't work, we knew there was value in those characters... We think they brought a lot of value to the launch. They brought a lot of breadth and depth to the line of books, and a diversity to the line. We didn't want to put them out and then forget about them. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> to make sure that they were prominent in other series, and that's why we put them in" [...] other series.|$|E

2500|$|Leonard notes {{one area}} of {{disagreement}} amongst applied economists which became famous in the US. That was the minimum-wage controversy. He notes that the fierceness of this controversy was odd because the likely effects were small and that several seemingly more important policy issues such as (entitlement reform, health insurance, CPI calculation) generated nothing like the storm. His explanation is that while this controversy was not especially important to the economy, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> to economics and economics as a policy science. His explanation {{for this is that}} minimum wage research came {{to be seen as a}} test of the usefulness of applying neoclassical price theory to the wages and employment. In other words, it was not just a technical quarrel over such things as the sign and size of wage-elasticity but rather an installment in a long running [...] methodological dispute over whether neoclassical price theory is in reality of any use.|$|E
