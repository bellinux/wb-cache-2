He {{was a highly}} effective tackler, able to either flatten opposition players or to quickly take the ball off their toes. After the tackle from behind was outlawed he adapted to the rule change by making hard challenges from the side. Manager Tony Waddington said that [...] "His qualities were his tackling strength and his courage. On the ball <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> what he could do, {{but he also had}} a tremendous ability to read the game." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Kim Manners {{noted that}} the episode [...] "was a really good show for me, because I had not {{got a chance to}} work with Mitch. And they wrote a great script, you know? It was really {{something}} he could sink his teeth into and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> a great job. Bill Davis was fabulous in that show too". This was the second episode of the series to not feature Scully, the first being the second season episode [...] "3". Guest actor Morris Panych, portraying the Syndicate assassin The Grey-Haired Man, makes his last appearance in the series in this episode. Panych had previously appeared in [...] "Piper Maru", [...] "Avatar", [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] and [...] "Memento Mori".|$|E
500|$|Commentator and Simpson's {{close friend}} David Saunders stated in his 1971 book, Cycling in the Sixties, that {{although}} he did not condone Simpson's use of drugs, he thought it was not the reason for his death. He said: [...] "I am quite convinced that Simpson killed himself because <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> not know when to stop. All his racing life he had punished his frail body, pushing it to the limits of endurance with his tremendous will-power and single-mindedness and, on Mont Ventoux, he pushed it too far, perhaps the drug easing the pain of it all." [...] Saunders {{went on to say that}} Simpson was not alone in the taking of drugs in professional cycling and that the authorities ignored their use. His opinion was that Simpson did not take drugs to gain an unfair advantage, but because [...] "he was not going to be beaten by a pill".|$|E

2500|$|For {{the first}} two years of his career, Jackson had some trouble {{adjusting}} to life with the Athletics; reports conflict as to whether <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> not like the big city, or if he was bothered by hazing from teammates. Consequently, he spent a great portion of that time in the minor leagues. Between 1908 and 1909, Jackson appeared in just 10 games. During the 1909 season, Jackson played 118 games for the South Atlantic League's Savannah Indians. He batted [...]358 for the year.|$|E
2500|$|Finger's contemporary, {{artist and}} writer Jerry Robinson, {{who worked with}} Kane from the beginning, said, “ {{had more to do}} with the molding of Batman than Bob. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> so many things at the beginning, ... {{creating}} almost all the other characters, ... the whole persona, the whole temper." [...] Batman inker George Roussos, another contemporary, said, [...] "Bob Kane had ideas while Bill sort of organized them". A DC Comics press release in 2007 said, [...] "Kane, along with writer Bill Finger, had just created Batman for DC predecessor National Comics." [...] Likewise, DC editor Paul Levitz wrote, [...] "The Darknight [...] Detective debuted in [...] #27, the creation of Bob Kane and Bill Finger." ...|$|E

2500|$|Orwell {{was noted}} for very close and {{enduring}} friendships {{with a few}} friends, but these were generally people with a similar background or with a similar level of literary ability. Ungregarious, {{he was out of}} place in a crowd and his discomfort was exacerbated when he was outside his own class. Though representing himself as a spokesman for the common man, he often appeared out of place with real working people. His brother-in-law Humphrey Dakin, a [...] "Hail fellow, well met" [...] type, who took him to a local pub in Leeds, said that he was told by the landlord: [...] "Don't bring that bugger in here again." [...] Adrian Fierz commented [...] "He wasn't interested in racing or greyhounds or pub crawling or shove ha'penny. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> not have much in common with people who did not share his intellectual interests." [...] Awkwardness attended many of his encounters with working-class representatives, as with Pollitt and McNair, but his courtesy and good manners were often commented on. Jack Common observed on meeting him for the first time, [...] "Right away manners, and more than manners – breeding – showed through." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jourgensen told Metal Hammer in August 2011 that Ministry {{was working}} on a new album called Relapse, which they hoped to release by Christmas. Regarding the sound of the new material, he explained, [...] "We've only got five songs to go. I've been {{listening}} to it {{the last couple of weeks}} and I wasn't really in the mood, I was just taking it as a joke. Just to pass the time at first but [...] raving about it. It's like, dude c'mon, this is not about Bush, so… that part's over. The ulcers are gone and Bush is gone so it's time for something new. I think this is actually gonna wind up being the fastest and heaviest record I've ever done. Just because we did it as anti-therapy therapy against the country music we would just take days off and thrash faster than I've done in a long time, faster than Mikey's done in a long time. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> a Rigor Mortis tour and said it was easy compared to this Ministry stuff so it's gonna be brutal and it's gonna freak a lot of people out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones often {{displayed}} a sheepish, self-deprecating {{sense of humor}} regarding his dire financial standing and bad reputation. [...] In June 1979, he appeared with Waylon Jennings on Ralph Emery's syndicated radio program {{and at one point}} Jennings cracked, [...] "It's lonely at the top." [...] A laughing Jones replied, [...] "It's lonely at the bottom, too! [...] It's real, real lonely, Waylon." [...] Despite his chronic unreliability, Jones was still capable of putting on a captivating live show. [...] On Independence Day, 1976, he appeared at Willie Nelson's Fourth of July Picnic in Gonzales, Texas in front of 80,000 younger, country-rock oriented fans. [...] A nervous Jones felt out of his comfort zone and nearly bolted from the festival but went on anyway and wound up stealing the show. [...] The Houston Post wrote, [...] "He was the undisputed star of this year's Willie Nelson picnic...one of the greatest." [...] Penthouse called him [...] "...the spirit of country music, plain and simple, its Holy Ghost". [...] The Village Voice added [...] "As a singer he is as intelligent as they come, and should be considered for a spot in America's all-time top ten." [...] Jones began missing more shows than he made, however, including several highly publicized dates at the Bottom Line club in New York City. [...] Former vice president of CBS Records Rick Blackburn recalls in the 1989 video Same Ole Me that the event had been hyped for weeks, with a lot of top press and cast members from Saturday Night Live planning to attend. [...] "We'd made our plans, travel arrangements and so forth. [...] George excused himself from my office, left - and we didn't see him for three weeks. [...] <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> not show up." [...] Much like Hank Williams, Jones seemed suspicious of success and furiously despised perceived slights and condescension directed towards the music that he loved so dearly. [...] When he finally played the Bottom Line in 1980, the New York Times called him [...] "the finest, most riveting singer in country music." ...|$|E

Luke trips over what's happening; he realizes at last that Bev is a fake, and that beautiful voice is actually Katie's.|$|R
50|$|Safdar is {{the most}} active and Imran's most trusted field partner. The best thing Imran likes about Safdar is that he never {{questions}} his authority, he, actually, {{is a man of}} action rather than words.

At first he didn't know why. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>did,</b> that was all. Without thinking what he was doing, he began to drum himself. Then he listened. At first he heard nothing. Then, soft and low, came that drumming sound again. Whitefoot replied to it. All the time he kept feeling better. He ran a little nearer to the place from which that drumming sound had come and then once more drummed. At first he got no reply.|$|E
60|$|Why didn't he like Val Dartie? He {{could not}} tell. Ignorant of family history, barely {{aware of that}} vague feud which had started {{thirteen}} years before with Bosinney's defection from June in favour of Soames' wife, knowing really almost nothing about Val he was at sea. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> dislike him. The question, however, was: What should he do? Val Dartie, it was true, was a second-cousin, {{but it was not}} the thing for Holly to go about with him. And yet to 'tell' of what he had chanced on was against his creed. In this dilemma he went and sat in the old leather chair and crossed his legs. It grew dark while he sat there staring out through the long window at the old oak-tree, ample yet bare of leaves, becoming slowly just a shape of deeper dark printed on the dusk.|$|E
