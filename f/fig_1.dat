5|$|In <b>Fig.</b> <b>1.</b> MN {{is part of}} that orbit. At point P, {{the body}} moves to Q under the action of a force {{directed}} towards S, as before. The force, F(SP) is defined at each point P on the curve.|$|E
5|$|Although space vector {{pulse-width}} modulation (SVPWM) {{is becoming}} increasingly popular, sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) is the most straightforward method used to vary drives' motor voltage (or current) and frequency. With SPWM control (see <b>Fig.</b> <b>1),</b> quasi-sinusoidal, variable-pulse-width output is constructed from intersections of a saw-toothed carrier signal with a modulating sinusoidal signal which is variable in operating frequency {{as well as in}} voltage (or current).|$|E
5|$|In <b>Fig.</b> <b>1,</b> a body {{is moving}} along a {{specific}} curve MN acted on by a (centripetal) force, towards the fixed point S. The force depends {{only of the}} distance of the point from S. The aim of this proposition is to determine how the force varies with the radius, SP. The method applies equally to the case where the force is centrifugal.|$|E

5|$|In the {{historically}} very important case where MN in <b>Fig.</b> <b>1</b> {{was part of}} an ellipse and S was one of its foci, Newton showed in Proposition 11 that the limit QR / QT2 was constant at each point on the curve so that the force on the body directed towards the fixed point S varied inversely as the square of the distance SP.|$|E
5|$|In Fig.2, the {{corresponding}} {{part of the}} revolving orbit is mn with s as its centre of force. Assume that initially, {{the body in the}} static orbit starts out at right angles to the radius with speed V. The body in the revolving orbit must also start at right angles and assume its speed is v. In the case shown in <b>Fig.</b> <b>1.,</b> v > V and the force is directed towards S. The argument applies equally if v < V. Also, the force may be directed away from the centre.|$|E
5|$|Since in {{the limit}} the forces are {{parallel}} to SP and sp, {{if the same}} force acted on the body in Fig. 2 as in <b>Fig.</b> <b>1,</b> the body would arrive at y, since ry = RQ. The difference in horizontal speed {{does not affect the}} vertical distances. Newton refers to Corollary 2 of the Laws of Motion where the motion of the bodies is resolved into a component in the radial direction acted on by the whole force, and the other component transverse to it, acted on by no force.|$|E

5|$|An ideal {{surface is}} flat, rigid, {{perfectly}} smooth, and chemically homogeneous, and has zero contact angle hysteresis. Zero hysteresis implies the advancing and receding contact angles are equal. In other words, only one thermodynamically stable contact angle exists. When {{a drop of}} liquid is placed on such a surface, the characteristic contact angle is formed as depicted in <b>Fig.</b> <b>1.</b> Furthermore, on an ideal surface, the drop will return to its original shape if it is disturbed. The following derivations apply only to ideal solid surfaces; they are only valid for the state in which the interfaces are not moving and the phase boundary line exists in equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Worcestershire had {{an unusually}} large number of exclaves (see <b>Fig</b> <b>1),</b> which were {{cut off from the}} main county and {{completely}} surrounded by the nearby counties of Warwickshire, Staffordshire, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire (Detached) and Oxfordshire. This relationship with neighbouring counties mirrored the confusing and fragmented layout of parishes within Worcestershire's own hundreds (See images and table below). The most notable islands were Dudley, Evenlode, Blockley and the area around Shipston-on-Stour. Herefordshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Shropshire had their own exclaves within the main part of Worcestershire at Rochford, Broome, Clent, Tardebigge (Tutnall and Cobley) and Halesowen respectively. Tardebigge's history outside the county is even more colourful, changing hands from Worcestershire to Staffordshire and Warwickshire, before returning to Worcestershire at differing times over the centuries. The southern boundary of the county was also complex, with parish boundaries penetrating deep into Gloucestershire and vice versa.|$|E

In mRNA samples from human brain, alternative splicing products have been detected, cloned and characterized.|$|E

The right side of <b>Fig.</b> <b>1</b> shows the input signals also being fed to the basal ganglia circuitry. The output from here, {{back to the same}} region, is shown to modify the strength of the input from B, by adding strength to the input from C thereby modifying the strongest signal from B to C.

25|$|The {{experiment}} uses a setup {{similar to}} that for the double-slit experiment. In Afshar's variant, light generated by a laser passes through two closely spaced circular pinholes (not slits). After the dual pinholes, a lens refocuses the light so {{that the image of}} each pinhole falls on separate photon-detectors (<b>Fig.</b> <b>1).</b> A photon that goes through pinhole number one impinges only on detector number one, and similarly, if it goes through pinhole two it impinges only on detector number two, which is why we see the pinholes separately in the image plane close to the mirrors before the photon-detectors.|$|E
