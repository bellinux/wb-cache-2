But it is a visionary product that pioneers numerous revolutionary computing technologies which are soon widely adopted by the computer industry.1961: Thomas J. Watson Research CenterIBM moves its research headquarters from Poughkeepsie, NY to Westchester County, NY, opening the Thomas J. Watson Research Center which remains IBM's largest research facility, centering on semiconductors, computer science, physical science and mathematics. The lab which IBM establish at Columbia University in 1945 was closed and moved to the Yorktown Heights laboratory in 1970.1961: IBM Selectric typewriterIBM introduces the Selectric typewriter product line. Later Selectric models feature memory, giving rise to the concepts of word processing and desktop publishing. The machine won numerous awards for its design and functionality. Selectrics and their descendants eventually captured 75 percent of the United States market for electric typewriters used in business. IBM replaced the Selectric line with the IBM Wheelwriter in 1984 and transferred its typewriter business to the newly formed Lexmark in 1991.1961: Report Program GeneratorIBM offers its Report Program Generator, an application that allows IBM 1401 users to produce reports. This capability was widely adopted throughout the industry, becoming a feature offered in subsequent generations of computers. It {{played an important role in}} the successful introduction of computers into small businesses.1962: Basic beliefsDrawing on established IBM policies, Thomas J. Watson, Jr., codifies three IBM basic beliefs: respect for the individual, customer service, and excellence.1962: SABRETwo IBM 7090 mainframes formed the backbone of the SABRE reservation system for American Airlines. As the first airline reservation system to work live over phone lines, SABRE linked high speed computers and data communications to <b>handle</b> <b>seat</b> inventory and passenger records.1964: IBM System/360In the most important product announcement in company history to date, IBM introduces the IBM System/360: a new concept in computers which creates a [...] "family" [...] of small to large computers, incorporating IBM Solid Logic Technology (SLT) microelectronics and using the same programming instructions. The concept of a compatible [...] "family" [...] of computers transforms the industry.1964: Word processingIBM introduces the IBM Magnetic Tape Selectric Typewriter, a product which pioneered the application of magnetic recording devices to typewriting, and gave rise to desktop word processing. Referred to then as [...] "power typing," [...] the feature of revising stored text improved office efficiency by allowing typists to type at [...] "rough draft" [...] speed without the pressure of worrying about mistakes.1964: New corporate headquartersIBM moves its corporate headquarters from New York City to Armonk, New York.1965: Gemini space flightsA 59-pound onboard IBM guidance computer is used on all Gemini space flights, including the first spaceship rendezvous. IBM scientists complete the most precise computation of the Moon's orbit and develop a fabrication technique to connect hundreds of circuits on a silicon wafer.1965: New York World's FairThe IBM Pavilion at the New York World's Fair closes, having hosted more than 10 million visitors during its two-year existence.1966: Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM)IBM invents one-transistor DRAM cells which permit major increases in memory capacity. DRAM chips become the mainstay of modern computer memory systems: the [...] "crude oil" [...] of the information age is born.1966: IBM System/4 PiIBM ships its first System/4Pi computer, designed to meet U.S. Department of Defense and NASA requirements. More than 9000 units of the 4Pi systems are delivered by the 1980s for use in the air, sea, and space.1966: IBM Information Management System (IMS)IBM designed the Information Management System (IMS) with Rockwell and Caterpillar starting in 1966 for the Apollo program, where it was used to inventory the very large bill of materials (BOM) for the Saturn V moon rocket and Apollo space vehicle.1967: Fractal geometryIBM researcher Benoit Mandelbrot conceives fractal geometry - the concept that seemingly irregular shapes can have identical structure at all scales. This new geometry makes it possible to mathematically describe the kinds of irregularities existing in nature. The concept greatly impacts the fields of engineering, economics, metallurgy, art, health sciences, and computer graphics and animation.1968: IBM Customer Information Control System (CICS)IBM introduces the CICS transaction monitor. CICS remains to this day the industry's most popular transactions monitor.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} biomechanical differences and similarities between on-water rowing and its simulation on Concept 2 and RowPerfect rowing machines. Handle force, positions of the <b>handle,</b> <b>seat</b> and trunk, shell acceleration were measured in single scull and on both machines in five female rowers. It was found that the rowers applied 30 - 40 % higher handle force on both machines than on-water. Stroke length was 11 - 12 % shorter on both machines, which mainly occurred by means of 30 % shorter arms drive. Legs drive was 4 - 6 % longer on Concept ergo-meter than on both RowPerfect and on-water. Significant differences were found in the handle velocity and shell acceleration profiles. Machines should be considered as a cross-training for rowers and can not replace on-water rowing. KEY WORDS: rowing, biomechanics, ergometer, comparison. INTRODUCTION: Rowing machines are widely used for cross-training and physiological testing in rowing. Concept 2 rowing ergo-meter became the most popular machine during the last decade. Providing obvious visual similarity with on-water rowing, exercise on machines has significant mechanical differences (Martindale & Robertson, 1986, Lamb, 1989). Th...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{study is}} trying to find {{kinematics}} differences between on-water rowing and its simulation on Concept 2 ergometer, and explain biomechanical differences between on-water rowing and its simulation on Concept 2 ergometer, which can affect the rowers motor control pattern and their on-water rowing technique. SIMI analysis system of Germany was used to capture the subjects’ movements throughout number of rowing strokes. The system was set to record movement at 25 frames per second. After the tests the saved file was processed using SIMI motion program, thus enabling each frame to be viewed and analyzed individually. Positions of the <b>handle,</b> <b>seat</b> and trunk, shell acceleration were measured in single scull on both machines and on-water in four female rowers. It was found there is about 60 - 80 % similarity between on-ergo and on-water rowing, the drive length on Concept 2 ergometer is 10 %- 12 % shorter than on-water, the stroke rate on-water is 10 - 15 % higher than on Concept 2 ergometer, legs drive was 4 - 6 % longer on Concept 2 ergometer than on-water. Significant differences were found in the handle velocity and shell acceleration profiles. The pattern of handle acceleration at catch is quite similar on-ergometer and on-water, because it depends more on the acceleration of the masses of the rower and boat, than on the acceleration of the oar only. Machines should be considered as a cross-training for rowers and can’t replace on-water rowing...|$|E

40|$|Oscillatory {{motions of}} <b>handles,</b> <b>seats,</b> and floors produce complex {{patterns}} of sensations {{in the body}} with the detection of these motions dependent on {{the sensitivity of the}} body to the applied vibration. This study examined the effect of input location (the hand, the seat, and the foot) and vibration frequency (8 – 315 Hz at the hand and foot; 2 – 315 Hz at the seat) on absolute thresholds for the perception of vibration in each of three axes (fore-and-aft, lateral, and vertical). Perception thresholds were determined with 96 males aged 20 – 29 years divided into eight groups of 12 subjects; each group received vibration at either the hand, the seat, or the foot in one of the three axes (one group experienced both lateral and vertical vibration at the hand). A frequency dependence in the thresholds was apparent {{for each of the three}} directions at each of the three locations; U-shaped acceleration threshold contours at frequencies greater than 80 Hz suggest the same psychophysical channel-mediated high-frequency thresholds at the hand, the seat, and the foot. Among the nine axes, sensitivity was greatest for vertical vibration at the seat at frequencies between 8 and 80 Hz, whereas sensitivity was greatest for vertical vibration at the hand at frequencies greater than 100 Hz. Absolute thresholds for the perception of vibration at the hand, the seat, and the foot are not consistent with the relevant frequency weightings in current standards...|$|R

40|$|In many {{occupational}} and leisure environments, {{the human body}} is exposed to oscillatory motions of <b>handles,</b> <b>seats</b> and floors which give rise to complex patterns of sensations. Knowledge of differences in sensitivity to the perception of vibration at the hand, seat and foot would assist the identification of sources of discomfort caused by vibration. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of vibration frequency (8 to 315 Hz for the hand and foot, 2 to 315 Hz for the seat) and input location (the hand, seat and foot) on thresholds for perception of vertical vibration. Perception thresholds were determined with 36 males aged 20 to 30 years divided into three groups of 12 subjects; each group received vertical vibration at either the hand, the seat, or the foot. At frequencies less than 50 Hz, sensitivity to vertical vibration at the seat was the greatest and sensitivity to vertical vibration at the hand was least (p< 0. 04). The differences in median sensitivity between the three locations were greatest at low frequencies: at 50 Hz the ratios of perception thresholds (ms- 2 r. m. s) for the three inputs were about 1. 0 (seat) : 1. 5 (foot) : 2 (hand); at 10 Hz the ratios were 1. 0 (seat) : 3 (foot) : 5 (hand).

The goal of this project {{was to develop a}} seesaw that is available for children aged 5 - 12 years; both with and without disabilities. The project has aimed to develop a seesaw that fits everyone in the target group without looking specially adapted. Children with disabilities have difficulty using today's seesaws because they consist of only a <b>seat</b> and a <b>handle</b> on each side. It requires that the user has strong arms and legs and can sit up without support. HAGS Aneby AB would like to change this. To gain knowledge of the target group and on the different types of disabilities information was sought for on the internet including the RBU's and UNICEF's websites. During implementation several concepts was developed and screened off to finally get the final result. Methods such as QFD, feasibility assessment and Go/No-Go-screening have been implemented. The instructions in the safety standard EN 1176 has been closely followed {{in the development of the}} seesaw. The final concept shows a broad <b>seat</b> with <b>handles,</b> <b>seat</b> backs and footrests on each side of a central section that is in the form of a U. On the sides of the seats there is a high lateral support, to lean against, and a low lateral support. Entry and exit will happen on the side where the low lateral support is situated. Rubber buds are placed on the back of the seats and on the outside of the high lateral support, so that an assistant could be able to assist with entry and exit and also to provide extra speed in use. A rubber suspension unit, that makes the seesaw move, restricts the movement to ± 30 ˚.
