5|$|Shankill Parish Church {{belongs to}} the Anglican Church of Ireland. The {{original}} church was established at Oxford Island {{on the shore of}} Lough Neagh in 1411, but a new church was built in Lurgan on the site of what is now Shankill Cemetery in 1609 as the town became the main centre of settlement in the area. It was eventually found to be too small given the growth of the town, and the Irish Parliament granted permission to build a replacement in 1725 one mile away on the 'Green of Lurgan', now known as Church Place, where <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> this day.

25|$|In August 1932 the {{announced}} Internordic Catholic rally {{finally took}} place in Copenhagen {{in the form of}} a Eucharistic Congress. All five countries were represented. Bishop Smit, who had resigned in 1927, was replaced by Bishop-elect Mgr. Jacques Mangers, S.M. (1889-1972), Vicar of South Norway, that country having in 1931 been divided into three jurisdictions. Among the many foreign dignitaries present for the occasion we find, once more, Cardinal van Rossum (who died only some weeks later) and Cardinal August Hlond of Gniezno and Poznań. <b>It</b> <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> reason that the busy programme of a Eucharistic Congress did not allow time for a formal Conference meeting.|$|E

In 199 ODI match wins, he took 326 wickets at under 19 apiece with a run rate of 3.70 and took 18 four-wicket hauls. His 257 not-out against Zimbabwe in 1996 is the highest innings by a number-8 batsman in Tests.

2500|$|The Muralitharan Report {{produced}} by the University of Western Australia's study has considered the Richards study done in 1999 to evaluate the error margin. University of South Australia's study done by Prof. Mahinda Pathegama argued that the Richards study which was presented by the University of Western Australia's study has used a rigid aluminium bar that only rotated in the horizontal plane to introduce such error margin. Pathegama's report stated that [...] "in view of the system used in the test itself yielding considerable error even with a rigid aluminum bar (an accuracy level of approximately 4 degrees {{as stated in the}} Murali Report), <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> reason that the error margin would be considerably larger when tracking skin markers on a spin bowler's moving upper limb by this same system".|$|E
2500|$|The {{black-chested buzzard-eagle}} is allied to the Buteo hawks, {{and it is}} {{sometimes}} included with these. Other authors place it in the monotypic genus Geranoaetus. Though the former {{seems to be more}} appropriate from a phylogenetic standpoint, the latter is still used here, as much more research into phylogeny and hybridization has to take place before the correct taxonomy of the buteonines can be resolved. <b>It</b> <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> note that the taxonomic and systematic dispute goes back to the early-mid 20th century already. However, it seems there is no real reason to suppose that the lineage of the black-chested buzzard-eagle is North American in origin; fossils that might have been its ancestors at first sight differ in details {{and are more likely to}} belong to other buteonine lineages. Because of its buteonine lineage, this species and the closely related Harpyhaliaetus are not considered [...] "true eagles", as are Aquila eagles and [...] "hawk-eagles", and are thus the largest extant type of the diverse buteonine lineage.|$|E
