6000|$|As we were {{tumbling}} the mingled rubbish on the floor, kicking it {{with our}} feet, and groping for these written evidences of the past, Lloyd, with a somewhat whitened face, produced a paper bag. [...] "What's this?" [...] said he. It contained a <b>granulated</b> <b>powder,</b> something the colour of Gregory's Mixture, but rosier; and as there were several of the bags, and each more or less broken, the powder was spread widely on the floor. Had any of us ever seen giant powder? No, nobody had; and instantly there grew up in my mind a shadowy belief, verging with every moment nearer to certitude, that I had somewhere heard somebody describe it as just such a powder as the one around us. I have learnt since {{that it is a}} substance not unlike tallow, and is made up in rolls {{for all the world like}} tallow candles.|$|E
60|$|It {{had been}} snowing for ten days: snowing in finely <b>granulated</b> <b>powder,</b> in damp, spongy flakes, in thin, {{feathery}} plumes, snowing from a leaden sky steadily, snowing fiercely, shaken out of purple-black clouds in white flocculent masses, or dropping in long level lines, like white lances from the tumbled and broken heavens. But always silently! The woods were so choked with it--the branches were so laden with it--it had so permeated, filled and possessed earth and sky; it had so cushioned and muffled the ringing rocks and echoing hills, that all sound was deadened. The strongest gust, the fiercest blast, awoke no sigh or complaint from the snow-packed, rigid files of forest. There was no cracking of bough nor crackle of underbrush; the overladen branches of pine and fir yielded and gave way without a sound. The silence was vast, measureless, complete! Nor {{could it be}} said that any outward sign of life or motion changed the fixed outlines of this stricken landscape. Above, there was no play of light and shadow, only the occasional deepening of storm or night. Below, no bird winged its flight across the white expanse, no beast haunted {{the confines of the}} black woods; whatever of brute nature might have once inhabited these solitudes had long since flown to the lowlands.|$|E

He was sent to school in Hampshire with his brothers Peter (1842-1901) and James (1844-1921), before becoming apprenticed to a local saddler. At the same time, his brother James began working for the Mellin Food Company in London, which produced a powdered baby food from malt and bran.

50|$|With the {{increased}} {{safety of the}} black powder substitutes often comes a reduced sensitivity to ignition. Flintlocks in particular need very sensitive, finely <b>granulated</b> <b>powder</b> {{for use in the}} flash pan, and black powder tends to perform more reliably in these and traditional caplock guns than substitutes. Modern in-line muzzleloaders provide a stronger ignition than traditional designs, and this helps to increase reliability with the less flame sensitive substitutes. In addition, magnum percussion caps are often recommended for use with black powder substitutes for both inline and traditional caplock guns, in place of the #11 percussion caps traditionally used with black powder in these guns, to achieve the best ignition reliability.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of a study about on the compaction behavior of a dry granulated red wall tile paste. The ceramic paste was formulated using raw materials of the Rio de Janeiro state. The raw materials were dry-ground and then microgranulated using a mixer of high intensity. The produced powder was characterized regarding X-ray diffraction, chemical composition, granule size analysis and morphology. The moisture content of the <b>granulated</b> <b>powder</b> (moisture mass/dry mass) varied between 0 and 10 %. The <b>granulated</b> <b>powder</b> with different moisture contents was submitted to cold compaction process using a uniaxial die-pressing technique with compaction pressure up to 60 MPa. The compaction behavior of the wall tile powder was evaluated through compaction response and compaction rate diagrams. The development of the microstructure during compaction process was followed by scanning electron microscopy. The experimental results show that the green density of the tile compacts behaves as a function of moisture content. It was also found that the compaction process is ruled, at the applied pressure range, by two dominant mechanisms including granule rearrangement and plastic deformation. The rate of densification is high initially, but then decreases rapidly for pressures above apparent yield pressure (2. 44 - 5. 38 MPa). In addition, the better compaction efficiency was found to be influenced by the moisture content...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, powder {{agglomeration}} {{technologies are}} increasingly {{employed in the}} food industry, in particular in the dairy processing industry, {{in order to control}} powder functionalities, such as rehydration behaviour, flowability, sensitivity to storage conditions, etc. Granulated powders are produced from agricultural raw materials and used both in the form of end products (e. g. milk powders in instant hot chocolate, or aggregated semolina in couscous dishes) and ingredient for food products manufacture (e. g. dairy protein powders for baby food formulation). However, the design and control of food powder granulation processes are still based on empirical knowledge, owing to the complexity of the involved physicochemical mechanisms. It would greatly benefit from the development of a multiscale model for food powder agglomeration that would integrate the intricate influences of powder reactivity and process parameters. In this work, a dimensional analysis approach was performed to identify the adimensional ratios governing agglomeration and their impact on <b>granulated</b> <b>powder</b> characteristics, whatever the considered food powder (milk, semolina, etc.) and agglomeration process (fluidised bed or drying chamber coupled with fine recycling).

40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of ceramic components, near-net-shape parts are commonly formed by uniaxially pressing <b>granulated</b> <b>powders</b> in rigid dies. Density gradients that are introduced into a powder compact during press-forming often increase the cost of manufacturing, and can degrade the performance and reliability of the finished part. Finite element method (FEM) modeling {{can be used to}} predict powder compaction response, and can provide insight into the causes of density gradients in green powder compacts; however, accurate numerical simulations require accurate material properties and realistic constitutive laws. To support an effort to implement an advanced cap plasticity model within the finite element framework to realistically simulate powder compaction, the authors have undertaken a project to directly measure as many of the requisite powder properties for modeling as possible. A soil mechanics approach has been refined and used to measure the pressure dependent properties of ceramic powders up to 68. 9 MPa (10, 000 psi). Due to the large strains associated with compacting low bulk density ceramic powders, a two-stage process was developed to accurately determine the pressure-density relationship of a ceramic powder in hydrostatic compression, and the properties of that same powder compact under deviatoric loading at the same specific pressures. Using this approach, the seven parameters that are required for application of a modified Drucker-Prager cap plasticity model were determined directly.

After drying, the ceramic green bodies were fired with different temperatures ranging from 1100 to 1175 o C for 3 h with a heating rate of 5 o C/min.
