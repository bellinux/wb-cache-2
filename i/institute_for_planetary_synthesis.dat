40|$|In the Planetary Emissivity Laboratory (PEL) at the <b>Institute</b> <b>for</b> <b>Planetary</b> Research of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Berlin, we set-up a {{simulation}} chamber for the spectroscopic investigation of minerals separates under Mercurial conditions. The chamber can be evacuated to 10 - 4 {{bar and the}} target samples heated to 700 K within few minutes, thanks to the innovative inductive heating system. While developing the protocol for the high temperature spectroscopy measurements we discovered interesting “morphologies” on the sample surfaces. The powders are poured into stainless steel cups of 50 mm internal diameter, 8 mm height and 3 mm depth, having a 5 mm thick base (thus leaving 3 mm free space for the minerals), and rim 1 mm thick. We selected several minerals of interest for Mercurial surface composition and {{for each of them}} we analyzed various grain size separates, to study the influence of grain dimensions to the process of thermal stressing. We observed that for the smaller grain size separate (0 - 25 µm) the thermal stress mainly induces large depressions and fractures, while on larger grain sizes (125 - 250 µm) small depressions and a cratered surface. Our current working hypothesis is that these features are mainly caused by thermal stress induced by a radiatively quickly cooling surface layer covering the much hotter bulk material. Further investigation is ongoing to understand the processes better. The observed morphologies exhibit surprising similarities to features observed at <b>planetary</b> scale size <b>for</b> example on Mercury and even on Venus. Especially the high resolution images provided currently from MESSENGER’S Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) instrument has revealed plains dominated by polygonal fractures whose origin still have to be determined.

40|$|We have {{measured}} the emissivity and reflectance spectra for {{a suite of}} analogues of relevance for asteroid studies. The suite consists of ten samples - 3 meteorites and 7 synthetic or terrestrial analogue materials. Meteorite Allende represents the CV group of the Carbonaceous Chondrites meteorites; Murchison meteorite is representing the CM group, while the meteorite Millbillillie represents achondritic eucrites. Synthetic and terrestrial enstatite, synthetic L-Chondrite and H-Chondrite, graphite and two phyllosilicates (montmorillonite and serpentine) complete the set of analogues. In the Planetary Emissivity Laboratory (PEL) at the <b>Institute</b> <b>for</b> <b>Planetary</b> Research of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Berlin, we can measure bi-directional reflectance of samples in the whole 1 to 100 µm spectral range, by using an evacuated (10 - 4 bar) Bruker Vertex 80 V FTIR spectrometer and a Bruker A 513 reflection unit, allowing phase angles between 26 ° and 170 °. The same instrument, coupled with an external emissivity chamber, {{can be used to}} measure emissivity of samples under the same vacuum and in the same wide spectral range, for sample temperatures from low (50 ° C) to very high (above 500 ° C). Complementary purged Bruker IFS 88 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a Harrick SeagullTM bi-conical reflection unit permits to cover the 0. 4 to 1. 1 µm spectral range.

40|$|Long-term {{instability}} in multiplanet exosystems {{is a crucial}} consideration when confirming putative candidates, analysing exoplanet populations, constraining the age of exosystems and identifying the sources of white dwarf pollution. Two planets that are Hill stable are separated by a wide-enough distance {{to ensure that they}} will never collide. However, Hill-stable planetary systems may eventually manifest Lagrange instability when the outer planet escapes or the inner planet collides with the star. We show empirically that for two nearly coplanar Hill-stable planets with eccentricities less than about 0. 3, instability can manifest itself only after a time corresponding to x initial orbits of the inner planet, where log 10 x ~ 5. 2 [μ/(MJupiter/M☉) ]- 0. 18 and μ is the planet-star mass ratio. This relation applies to any type of equal-mass secondaries, and suggests that two low-eccentricity Hill-stable terrestrial-mass or smaller mass planets should be Lagrange stable throughout the main-sequence lifetime of any white dwarf progenitor. However, Hill-stable giant planets are not guaranteed to be Lagrange stable, particularly within a few tens of per cent beyond the critical Hill separation. Our scaling represents a useful `rule of thumb' <b>for</b> <b>planetary</b> population <b>syntheses</b> or individual systems for which performing detailed long-term integrations is unfeasible...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{a population of}} transiting planets that receive relatively modest stellar insolation, indicating equilibrium temperatures < 1000 K, and for which the heating mechanism that inflates hot Jupiters {{does not appear to}} be significantly active. We use structural evolution models to infer the amount of heavy elements within each of these planets. There is a correlation between the stellar metallicity and the mass of heavy elements in its transiting planet(s). It appears that all giant planets posses a minimum of ∼ 10 - 15 Earth masses of heavy elements, with planets around metal-rich stars having larger heavy element masses. There is also an inverse relationship between the mass of the planet and the metal enrichment (Z_ pl / Z_ star), which appears to have little dependency on the metallicity of the star. Saturn- and Jupiter-like enrichments above solar composition are a hallmark of all the gas giants in the sample, even planets of several Jupiter masses. These relationships provides an important constraint on planet formation, and suggests large amounts of heavy elements within planetary H/He envelopes. We suggest that the observed correlation can soon also be applied to inflated planets, such that the interior heavy element abundance of these planets could be estimated, yielding better constraints no their interior energy sources. We point to future directions <b>for</b> <b>planetary</b> population <b>synthesis</b> models and suggest future correlations. This appears to be the first evidence that extrasolar giant planets, as a class, are enhanced in heavy elements. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, Accepted to ApJ...|$|R

40|$|Spectral Library: The Berlin Emissivity Database (BED) is a {{spectral}} library {{containing the}} emissivity measurements of several planetary analogues. It contains currently entries for plagioclase and potassium feldspars, low Ca and high Ca pyroxenes, olivines, elemental sulphur, common martian analogues (JSC Mars- 1, Salten Skov, palagonites, montmorillonite, hematite, goethite) and a lunar highland soil sample {{measured in the}} wavelength range from 3 to 50 µm {{as a function of}} particle size. For each sample, the spectra of four well defined particle size separates (< 25 µm, 25 - 63 µm, 63 - 125 µm, 125 - 250 µm) are measured with a 4 cm- 1 spectral resolution. These size separates have been selected as typical representations for most of the planetary surfaces [1]. Laboratory set-up: The instrumentation is located in the Planetary Emissivity Laboratory (PEL) at the <b>Institute</b> <b>for</b> <b>Planetary</b> Research (PF) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Berlin, Germany. It consists of a spectrometer attached to an external emissivity device. The Bruker VERTEX 80 v spectrometer, has a very high spectral resolution (better then 0. 2 cm- 1), and a resolving power of better than 300, 000 : 1, and can be operated under vacuum conditions. To cover the entire 1 to 50 µm spectral range, two detectors, a liquid nitrogen cooled MTC and a room temperature DTGS and two beamsplitter, a KBr and a Multilayer are used to measure the same target. The emissivity device is composed of the sample chamber, a double-walled box with three apertures: a 15 cm squared door used to insert the cup in the box, a 5 cm rounded opening through which the beam is directed to the spectrometer and a 5 cm opening facing the attached blackbody unit. A heater is placed in the chamber and is used to heat the cup with samples from the bottom. The thermal radiation emitted normal to the surface by the sample or the blackbody is collected by an Aucoated parabolic off-axis mirror and reflected to the entrance port of the spectrometer. Figure 1 shows the emissivity device attached to the spectrometer external port: the sample chamber is opened to show the parabolic mirror mounted on a mechanical arm and oriented toward the reference blackbody, the sample heater and the purging system. A pump circulates water at a constant temperature in the volume between the inner and outer walls of the chamber. The surfaces of the box are painted with black high emissivity paint. The chamber is purged with dry air to remove particulates, water vapour and CO 2. Further details can be found in [2, 3]. Emissivity spectra: In Figure 2 an example of quartz measurements for two extreme grain sizes is shown, together with analogue measurements extracted from the ASU and ASTER spectral libraries. Complementary to the existing datasets (ASU and ASTER), the BED library sensibly extend both the investigated spectral range and the grain size ranges. The enormous difference between the spectra of the small and large fractions witness the need for such a complete dataset for a correct interpretation of remote sensing data. Martian analogues: The emission spectra of standard martian analogue materials like the JSC Mars- 1 (a palagonitic tephra from Hawaii, USA), the Salten Skov (a Fe-oxide precipitate from the Midjutland region of Denmark), montmorillonite, hematite, goethite and some palagonites from Hawaii, USA, are shown and discussed in this paper.
