5|$|The Ramlila of Ramnagar is a {{dramatic}} enactment of Rama's legend, as told in Ramacharitamanasa. The plays, sponsored by Kashi Naresh, are performed in Ramnagar every <b>evening</b> <b>for</b> 31 days. On the last day, the festivities reach a crescendo as Rama vanquishes the demon king Ravana. Kashi Naresh Udit Narayan Singh started this tradition around 1830.|$|E
5|$|The resort's {{staff had}} left a note in a message book at the swimming-pool {{reception}} area, asking that the same table, which overlooked the apartments, be block-booked for 20:30 for the McCanns and friends every <b>evening</b> <b>for</b> the last four evenings of the holiday. The message said the group's children were asleep in the apartments. Madeleine's mother believes the abductor may have seen the note.|$|E

5|$|Ceremonies came to {{surround}} many memorials; many memorials were formally opened or unveiled in public ceremonies, {{while others were}} used for recurring ceremonies on commemorative days. Memorials in Britain and France were typically opened in civic ceremonies involving local dignitaries, veterans and the next-of-kin of fallen servicemen. Some memorials acquired daily ceremonies; in 1928 it became customary to play the Last Post bugle call at the Menin Gate memorial each <b>evening,</b> <b>for</b> example, and this practice spread to many other similar memorials in France.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, Tuesday 23 February, Gothenburg passed Cooktown {{at about}} 2:00pm. The {{wind and rain}} {{severely}} increased and cloud cover became so thick it blocked out the sun. Despite this, she continued the journey south into worsening weather, in a deep water passage between the North Queensland coastline and the Great Barrier Reef, known as the inner route. Although taking this route provided some protection from the open sea, captains had to navigate and thread {{their way through a}} number of then uncharted reefs. All passengers and crew expected to be in Newcastle on Sunday <b>evening</b> <b>for</b> a scheduled stopover.|$|E
5|$|The Crimson Tide {{opened the}} second half with a second missed Foster field goal, {{followed}} by each team again trading punts before the next Alabama points. The fourth Crimson Tide touchdown of the game came on a 42-yard McCarron pass to Cooper that extended the Alabama lead to 30–10. Tennessee advanced {{the ball to the}} Crimson Tide 21-yard line on their next possession before Robert Lester intercepted the second Bray pass of the <b>evening</b> <b>for</b> a touchback. Early in the fourth, Alabama extended their lead to 37–10 on a 39-yard McCarron pass to Kenny Bell. The Alabama defense then held the Volunteers on a fourth down to give the Crimson Tide possession at their 42-yard line. Three plays later, Yeldon scored on a 43-yard run for the final Alabama points and a 44–10 lead. Tennessee then scored the final points of the game on a 21-yard Palardy field goal that was set up after a Blake Sims fumble gave the Volunteers possession at the Alabama 24-yard line that made the final score 44–13.|$|E

5|$|Howell and Fraser {{took off}} in their Martinsyde from Hounslow Heath Aerodrome on 4 December 1919. However, the pair soon ran into poor weather, and were forced to land the {{aircraft}} in Dijon, France later that day. Airborne again, they reached Pisa, Italy the following day, where a replacement tail skid was fitted to the A1; by 6 December, the duo were in Naples. On 10 December, Howell and Fraser {{took off in}} their fully fuelled plane from Taranto in the afternoon. They intended to reach Africa next, but poor weather conditions forced them to alter their plan and they instead headed for Crete. Their Martinsyde was reported flying over St George's Bay, Corfu at 20:00 that <b>evening.</b> <b>For</b> unknown reasons, Howell and Fraser attempted to execute an emergency landing at Corfu. They were, however, unable {{to make it to}} the coast and were forced to crash into the sea. Citizens in the area later reported that they heard cries for help coming from the sea that night, but that a rescue was not possible in the rough conditions. Both Howell and Fraser were drowned.|$|E

Lloyd Berkner attended the panel meetings {{for the first time in}} the afternoon of the third day, Friday, January 16.

25|$|After the examination, Arush's {{body was}} then used for medical {{practice}} for soldiers, demonstrating how to stab a tracheotomy into a wounded man's throat {{to allow him}} to breathe, and then used to demonstrate the proper preparation of a body for transportation. The body was then returned to the body bag, and sent into the local hospital, where Dr. Xelen released it to Arush's family the same <b>evening.</b> <b>For</b> the next two weeks, Colonel Allan Wells approached Vice-Admiral Larry Murray asking to send military police to Somalia to investigate the shooting, but was rebuffed. When the Chief of Defence Staff, Admiral John Rogers Anderson, visited the military base on March 8–9, he visited the wounded Somali recovering in the Canadian hospital.|$|E

Some people instead walked to Lossiemouth to see the train arrive. The board of the Elgin and Lossiemouth Harbour Company met the passengers and escorted them to the recently opened Steamboat and Railway Hotel where they were entertained. They then proceeded to a large marquee erected overlooking the station on top of the quarry cliffs where many people made fine speeches before lunch was served. The celebrations included sports and games. The Board and prominent citizens met later that <b>evening</b> <b>for</b> a commemorative dinner. The trains ran all day until midnight and carried around 3000 passengers.|$|E
