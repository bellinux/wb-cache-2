In the episode, Michael Scott's (Steve Carell) replacement appears in the office, to start receiving training from Michael.

Only Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is apathetic about the new leader.|$|E

Midway through the campaign Gould had promised him a new two-year contract, but following the poor end to the season he instead opted to release Allardyce.|$|E

From 1825 to 1848 the average number of ships traveling to California increased to about 25 ships per year—a large increase from the average of 2.5 ships per year from 1769 to 1824.|$|E
25|$|Defensive midfielders require good {{positional}} sense, work rate, tackling ability, and anticipation (of {{player and}} ball movement) to excel. They {{also need to}} possess good passing skills and close control to hold the ball in midfield under sustained pressure. Most importantly, defensive midfielders require great stamina as they are the outfield players who cover the greatest distance during a professional match. In top football clubs, a midfielder may cover up to 12 kilometres for a full 90-minute game. Deep-lying playmakers typically require a <b>good</b> <b>first</b> touch under opposition pressure {{and the ability to}} play long crossfield passes to attacking players further upfield.|$|E

25|$|The railway {{also had}} tourist potential. In 1906, Thomas Cook & Son travel agency advertised {{trips to the}} Holy Land {{utilizing}} the valley line. A notable package was a trip using the valley line from Haifa to Samakh, where the tourists would take a steam boat to Tiberias via the Sea of Galilee and explore the Christian holy sites around the lake. When the line became popular with tourists, the travel conditions were improved {{in order to make}} a <b>good</b> <b>first</b> impression to dignitaries and aristocrats from all over Europe. In 1912, first and second class cars were introduced.|$|E
25|$|After superlative {{performances}} for {{his country}} at Euro 2000, Alpay signed for English club Aston Villa. He enjoyed a <b>good</b> <b>first</b> season with Villa and he became a fan favourite. His abilities caught the interest of Arsenal and Newcastle United. With the arrival of Olof Mellberg, the duo {{became one of the}} most talented central-defensive partners in Europe. The partnership was cut short as Alpay injured his ankle which sidelined him for the remainder of the season. He recovered just in time for the 2002 World Cup, in which he formed the core of an obstinate Turkish defensive unit. They finished third and he was elected into the team of the tournament.|$|E

Romney was nominated in August and chose Congressman Paul Ryan, a young advocate of drastic budget cuts, as his running mate. Throughout the summer polls showed a close race and Romney had a <b>good</b> <b>first</b> debate, but otherwise had trouble reaching out to ordinary voters. He lost to Obama 51% to 47% and instead of gaining in the Senate as expected, Republicans lost seats.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Schumacher again {{competed with}} Williams {{alongside}} Montoya. He {{was unable to}} take part in winter testing in January, prior to the season because of reoccurring back pains, although he later returned in February. He endured a <b>good</b> <b>first</b> half of the season: Schumacher scored points in the opening seven races, and clinched his first podium of the season with second place in Canada. Schumacher backed up the results by taking consecutive victories in the European Grand Prix and the French Grand Prix. He managed to finish in 9th-place in Britain. At the German Grand Prix, Schumacher retired on the first lap of the race after a collision with Rubens Barrichello and Kimi Räikkönen, for which he received a 10-place grid penalty for the next race. Williams successfully appealed against the decision and Schumacher managed to qualify 2nd for the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he finished 4th.|$|E
25|$|Arkansas ran for 257 yards, and Ole Miss QB Eli Manning {{threw for}} 414 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions.

Ole Miss gained a 2–0 lead, but fumbled near {{the close of the}} first quarter, resulting in a Razorback field goal. Lerinezo Robinson for the Hogs then returned a fumbled kickoff eight yards for a touchdown, giving Arkansas a 10–2 lead. Jonathan Nichols of Ole Miss then hit a 48-yard field, but a Jimmy Beasley interception of Eli Manning set up Arkansas for a 34-yard option keep touchdown by Matt Jones, giving an edge to the Hogs, 17–5. Manning then connected with Justin Sawyer, but the two point play was no <b>good.</b> <b>First</b> a field goal, then a touchdown closed out the first half for the Razorbacks, the TD set up by a 55-yard punt return by Decori Birmingham, to the Ole Miss 20.|$|E

50|$|<b>Good</b> {{defensive}} <b>first</b> basemen, {{according to}} Bill James, {{are capable of}} playing off first base {{so that they can}} field ground balls hit to the fair side of first base. The first baseman then relies upon the pitcher to cover first base to receive the ball to complete the out. Indications of a <b>good</b> defensive <b>first</b> baseman include a large number of assists and a low number of throwing errors by other infielders.|$|R
