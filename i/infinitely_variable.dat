25|$|Factors {{which have}} been shown to affect the {{drive-train}} efficiency include the type of transmission system (chain, shaft, belt), the type of gearing system (fixed, derailleur, hub, <b>infinitely</b> <b>variable),</b> the size of the sprockets used, the magnitude of the input power, the pedalling speed, and how rusty the chain is. For a particular gearing system, different gear ratios generally have different efficiencies.|$|E

We also find combinatorial interpretations of the plethystic Abel polynomial and the plethystic inverse Abel polynomial...|$|R

25|$|The Javelin was {{reportedly}} easy to fly even on one engine. The flight controls were fully power-assisted and production aircraft adopted a hydraulic 'feel' {{system for the}} pilot. The Javelin featured an <b>infinitely</b> <b>variable</b> airbrake; the airbrake proved to be extremely responsive and effective, allowing pilots to conduct rapid descents and heavy braking manoeuvres, enabling equally rapid landings to be performed. The turnaround time between sorties was significantly shorter than with the preceding Gloster Meteor, due to improved ground accessibility and engine ignition sequence. Unlike the Meteor, the Javelin was fitted with ejector seats, at the introduction to service of the type.|$|E
25|$|The Insight’s Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) {{provides}} infinite ratios to {{keep the}} engine operating within its most efficient range. Forward gear ratios are <b>infinitely</b> <b>variable</b> between 3.172–0.529 and reverse gear ranges from 4.511~1.693. Final drive is 4.20:1. On Insight EX models, paddle shifters mounted {{behind the steering wheel}} allow the driver to engage a manual shift mode and select from seven simulated gear ratios for full control over acceleration and engine braking. Since the CVT’s gear ratios are continuously variable the system electronically directs the transmission to up- or downshift into pre-determined ratios when the driver taps the shift paddles. In normal driving, the CVT allows the engine and IMA motor to stay in their most efficient operating range thereby providing superior fuel efficiency to that of a conventional automatic transmission with fixed gear ratios. The CVT’s variable gear ratios allow for both quick, initial acceleration and efficient, low-rpm cruising.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the existence of}} local holomorphic solutions Y of linear partial differential equations in three complex variables whose coefficients are holomorphic on some polydisc in C 2 outside some singular set Θ. The coefficients are written as linear combinations of powers of a solution X of some first order nonlinear partial differential equation following an idea we have initiated in a previous work [20]. The solutions Y are shown to develop singularities along Θ with estimates of exponential type depending on the growth’s rate of X near the singular set. We construct these solutions {{with the help of}} series of functions with <b>infinitely</b> many <b>variables</b> which involve derivatives of all orders of X in one variable. Convergence and bounds estimates of these series are studied using a majorant series method which leads to an auxiliary functional equation that contains differential operators in <b>infinitely</b> many <b>variables.</b> Using a fixed point argument, we show that these functional equations actually have solutions in some Banach spaces of formal power series. Key words: singular linear partial differential equations, linear partial differential equations with <b>infinitely</b> many <b>variables,</b> formal series with <b>infinitely</b> many <b>variables,</b> singularity analysis. 2000 MSC: 35 C 10...|$|R

2500|$|Throughout this era, {{development}} of automotive technology was rapid, {{due in part}} to hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included the electric ignition system (by dynamotor on the Arnold in 1898, though Robert Bosch, 1903, tends to get the credit), independent suspension (actually conceived by Bollée in 1873), and four-wheel brakes (by the Arrol-Johnston Company of Scotland in 1909). Leaf springs were widely used for suspension, though many other systems were still in use, with angle steel taking over from armored wood as the frame material of choice. Transmissions and throttle controls were widely adopted, allowing a variety of cruising speeds, though vehicles generally still had discrete speed settings, rather than the <b>infinitely</b> <b>variable</b> system familiar in cars of later eras. Safety glass also made its debut, patented by John Wood in England in 1905. (It would not become standard equipment until 1926, on a Rickenbacker.) ...|$|E

6000|$|In this {{argument}} {{there are three}} very palpable fallacies: {{the first is the}} rough application of measurement to the heads, necks, and limbs, without observing the subtile differences of proportion and position of parts in the members themselves, for it would be strange if the different adjustment of the ears and brow in the dog and horse, did not require a harmonizing difference of adjustment in the head and neck. The second fallacy is that above specified, the supposition that proportion cannot be beautiful if susceptible of variation, whereas the whole meaning of the term has reference to the adjustment and functional correspondence of <b>infinitely</b> <b>variable</b> quantities. And the third error is the oversight of the very important fact, that, although [...] "different and even contrary forms and dispositions are consistent with beauty," [...] they are by no means consistent with equal degrees of beauty, so that, while we find in all the presence of such proportion and harmony of form, as gifts them with positive agreeableness consistent with the station and dignity of each, we perceive, also, such superiority of proportion in some (as the horse, eagle, lion, and man for instance) as may best be in harmony with the nobler functions and more exalted powers of the animals.|$|E
60|$|It is {{not every}} dramatist who treats {{the art of}} acting as seriously as the art of composition. The great author of Wilhelm Meister is the most {{remarkable}} exception to this rule, and Lessing is only second to him. It is hardly possible {{for a man to}} be a great dramatist, and it is simply impossible for a man to be a great critic of the drama, who has not seriously studied the rules, aims, and conditions of stage representation. Hazlitt, for instance, has written some admirable pages about the poetry, the imaginative conception, the language, of Shakespeare's plays, but we find his limit when he says that King Lear is so noble a play that he cannot bear to see it acted. As if a play could be fully judged without reference to the conditions of the very object with which it was written. A play is to be criticised as a play, not merely as a poem. The whole structure of a piece depends on {{the fact that it is}} to be acted; its striking moments must be great dramatic, not merely beautiful poetic, moments. They must have the intensity of pitch by which the effect of action exceeds the effect of narrative. This intensity is made almost <b>infinitely</b> <b>variable</b> with the variations in the actor's mastery of his art.|$|E
