5000|$|Siamese {{rosewood}} is denser than water, fine grained, {{and high}} in oils and resins. These properties make them <b>dimensionally</b> <b>stable,</b> hard wearing, rot and insect resistant, and when new, highly fragrant.

50|$|In 1895, a Japanese firm, Hemmi, {{started to}} make slide rules from bamboo, which had the {{advantages}} of being <b>dimensionally</b> <b>stable,</b> strong, and naturally self-lubricating. These bamboo slide rules were introduced in Sweden in September, 1933, and probably only a little earlier in Germany. Scales were made of celluloid, plastic, or painted aluminium. Later cursors were acrylics or polycarbonates sliding on Teflon bearings.|$|R

50|$|Acetylation {{changes the}} free hydroxyls within the wood into acetyl groups. This {{is done by}} {{reacting}} the wood with acetic anhydride, which comes from acetic acid (known as vinegar when in its dilute form).

Besides, the tin dioxide is more effective in reactions of phenol, bisphenol, and aniline oxidation [7].|$|R

40|$|Bioengineered bone {{substitutes}} might represent {{alternatives to}} autologous bone grafts in medically compromised patients due to reduced operation time and comorbidity. Due {{to the lack}} of an inherent vascular system their dimension is limited to the size of critical bone size defect. To overcome this shortcoming, the experiment tried to create heterotopic bone around vessels. In vivo, a two-component fibrin and thrombin gel containing recombinant bone morphogenic protein (rhBMP- 2) and transglutamate vascular endothelial growth factor (TG-VEGF) in different ratios, respectively, was injected into a <b>dimensionally</b> <b>stable</b> membrane tube, wrapped around the femoral vessel bundle in twelve New Zealand white rabbits. Sacrifice occurred eight weeks postoperatively. Microcomputed tomography of the specimens showed significantly increased bone volume in the rhBMP- 2 to TG-VEGF ratio of 10 to 1 group. Histology showed new bone formation in close proximity to the vessel bundle. Immunohistochemistry detected increased angiogenesis within the newly formed bone in the rhBMP- 2 to TG-VEGF ratios of 3 to 1 and 5 to 1. Heterotopic bone was engineered in vivo around vessels using different rhBMP- 2 and TG-VEGF ratios in a fibrin matrix injected into a <b>dimensionally</b> <b>stable</b> membrane tube which prevented direct contact with skeletal muscles. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
50|$|In skydiving, Spectra {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{materials}} used for suspension lines, largely supplanting the earlier-used Dacron, being lighter and less bulky. Spectra has excellent strength and wear-resistance, but is not <b>dimensionally</b> <b>stable</b> (ie. shrinks) when exposed to heat, which leads to gradual and uneven shrinkage of different lines as they are subject to differing amounts of friction during canopy deployment, necessitating periodic line replacement. It is also almost completely inflexible, which can exacerbate the opening shock. For that reason, Dacron (PET) lines continue to be used in student and some tandem systems, where the added bulk is less of a concern than the potential for an injurious opening. In turn, in high performance parachutes used for swooping, Spectra is replaced with Vectran and HMA (high-modulus aramid), which are even thinner and <b>dimensionally</b> <b>stable,</b> but exhibit greater wear and require much more frequent maintenance to prevent catastrophic failure. Spectra / Dyneema are also used for reserve parachute closing loops when used with automatic activation devices, where their extremely low coefficient of friction is critical for proper operation in the event of cutter activation.|$|R
