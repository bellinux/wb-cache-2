According to the Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) Awareness Network about 155, 000 patients are living nowadays with MBC, and about 40, 000 deaths are reported annually in the United States of America. About 10 % of the patients visiting the clinic or appearing at the <b>emergency</b> <b>sittings</b> are diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer at the initial screening and require an urgent and effective treatment, which mainly focuses on controlling the disease and {{improve the quality of}} life.

40|$|A 84 -year-old {{white female}} {{had a brief}} loss of {{consciousness}} while playing bridge. A few minutes before the episode she had eaten pizza and significant amount of carbonated soft drinks. After recovery, her friends noticed that she was alert, but pale and sweating. Upon arrival at the <b>emergency</b> room, <b>sitting</b> blood pressure was 160 / 60 [*]mmHg with a normal sinus rhythm. A chest X-Ray was performed, which was essential to make the diagnosis. The X-Ray showed a large retrocardiac opacity with air and liquid level compatible with a giant hiatus hernia. After a copious snack the hiatal hernia compressed the left atrium, decreasing the left cardiac output, elucidating the mechanism of the syncopal episode. In patients presenting with swallow syncope (particularly after a copious meal, validating {{the importance of a}} careful history), a chest X-Ray should be always be performed...|$|R
2500|$|After the 11 September {{terrorist}} {{attacks against the}} United States, the UK Parliament was recalled, and a solemn five-hour <b>emergency</b> <b>sitting</b> of the House of Commons debated the crisis. Jonathan Sayeed said that military might alone {{would not be enough}} to deal with the problem. [...] "There has to be some understanding why there is such hatred for so many institutions within the United States. Unless we deal with some of the deep-seated causes, then more terrorists will come to the fore." [...] However, the Prime Minister was adamant {{that there should be no}} [...] "moral ambiguity" [...] about the events in the US, that the entitlement to dislike the US could never justify the actions carried out.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 April 2009, ten police {{officers}} went to Syvret's home, where they arrested him {{and carried out}} an extensive search of the property. Syvret was held in custody for seven hours and questioned about alleged breaches of Jersey data protection law in relation to his naming of [...] "Nurse M". The Jersey Evening Post criticized police tactics, as did MPs in the UK Parliament. An <b>emergency</b> <b>sitting</b> of the States assembly was called – though the assembly subsequently voted against a proposition critical of the police's actions. Svyret's lawyer complained that data protection laws were being used to restrict his freedom of expression, contrary to human rights. In 2011, the police conceded that the arrest could have been handled better.|$|E
50|$|On 27 February 2009, Sivakumar {{called for}} an <b>emergency</b> <b>sitting</b> of the Assembly to be held on 3 March 2009 to vote on two motions, the first motion being the {{affirmation}} of Mohammad Nizar Jamaluddin's government as the legitimate one and the second motion being the approval to dissolve the assembly to pave way for fresh polls in the state. Defying Sivakumar's directive, the Perak legal advisor, Ahmad Kamal Mohd Shahid prevented the notification of the <b>emergency</b> <b>sitting</b> from being released because the meeting did not obtain {{the consent of the}} Monarch. Sivakumar's lawyer Augustine Anthony countered the legal advisor citing that as an adjourned sitting, the session is not dissolved or prorogued and therefore does not require the consent of the Sultan.|$|E
5000|$|The London stadium {{had been}} {{designed}} assuming that the cauldron would sit above, as had become customary, {{on a part of}} the roof that was specially strengthened. However, to conform with the brief, the cauldron was not to be [...] "like an <b>emergency</b> police siren <b>sitting</b> on top of a car"; it was to be inside the stadium, at the very centre for its lighting and then moved and burning at one side of the stadium {{for the duration of the}} Games. [...] "The spirit Danny was speaking about...was to do with connecting more with people and rooting things, rather than them just being up in the air like a dream in the sky. And we were looking at pictures together in my studio, like the London 1948 games and there the cauldron was sitting in among the spectators in the stadium, it was there with everybody...a participant rather than a beacon in the sky". This was to prove a controversial decision, as it meant that visitors to the Olympic Park to watch the other sports were denied the customary view of the flame over the stadium. The cauldron was therefore shown on video screens around the Olympic Park.|$|R

5000|$|At 16:42, Parliament convened for an <b>emergency</b> <b>sitting.</b> The Party of Regions did {{not take}} part.

The entire parliamentary faction of the Communist Party of Ukraine and some 80% of the Party of Regions chose to miss the session. Lawmakers barred chiefs and commanders of the Interior Troops, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the SBU, and other government agencies from carrying out any counter-terrorism operations because they violated the Constitution of Ukraine. They were also ordered to stop blocking roads and bridges, squares and streets in Kiev and other cities and towns. The Party of Regions MPs at the sitting agreed to form an [...] "anti-crisis group".|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere are no {{large scale}} studies {{exclusive}} for pulmonary artery aneurysms {{as a cause}} of massive hemoptysis, only small studies are there.

This article emphasises the role of CTA in diagnosing and embolisation as emergency management of these aneurysms...|$|E
