40|$|In {{the earth}} sciences, and {{particularly}} in the mining of precious metals, data distributions are often strongly positively skewed. When making decisions on the potential profitability of a gold mine, for example, the high values of the distribution are of particular importance. Indicator kriging provides estimates of cumulative distribution functions from which grade tonnage curves may be calculated. Multiple or <b>full</b> <b>indicator</b> kriging requires a semivariogram to be modelled and a kriging system of equations to be solved for each cut off. This can be time consuming and modelling indicator semivariograms at high cut-offs may be difficult because of the low number of data above the cut off. One way to avoid these problems is to use median indicator kriging. Median indicator kriging uses the same semivariogram model at each cut off and may not perform as well as <b>full</b> <b>indicator</b> kriging. This thesis presents comparisons of median <b>indicator</b> kriging and <b>full</b> <b>indicator</b> kriging in the analysis of three suites of data for which the assumptions of median indicator kriging are only approximately satisfied. The distributions of the sample data sets have different degrees of skewness and sparseness. Two of the data suites represent highly skewed gold mineralisations and grade tonnage curves are obtained from the results of both indicator kriging methods. The third suite consists of approximately normally distributed air permeability data. The results from the two methods are compared with reality and show that median indicator kriging performs as well as <b>full</b> <b>indicator</b> kriging in each case...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{integration}} of <b>indicators</b> of <b>reading,</b> analytical thinking and writing abilities with indicators of subject content {{is a means}} to evaluate the assessment of reading, analyzing and writing as part ofthe curriculum. The objective {{of this study is}} to integrate the <b>indicators</b> of <b>reading,</b> analytical thinking, and writing ability with the indicators of assessment of mathematics studied by grade 9 students. This is performed by analyzing the content of both indicators. From the investigation of essential aspects and a survey of teachers, the study found that the {{integration of}} indicators comprised of three abilities and eleven <b>indicators.</b> The <b>reading</b> ability consisted of two indicators: the summarizing of the main idea of the text and the interpretation of the reading. The analytical thinking ability consisted of five indicators: analyzing reading, numerical analysis, problem solving, reasoning and creating. The writing ability consisted of four indicators: the discussion arising from reading a story, drawing a graph, writing associated with data analysis and data presentation. These assessment are useful for measuring and assessing the result of studying mathematics, and developing test item specifications for integrating between the <b>indicators</b> of <b>reading,</b> analytical thinking, and writing abilities and the indicators of the content of a subject of study...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} median <b>indicator</b> kriging and <b>full</b> <b>indicator</b> kriging {{in the analysis of}} gold mineralisation data from the Goodall gold mine in the Northern Territory of Australia. The sample data used in this study consist of exploration drilling data, suitably composited, taken from the 540 mRL bench of the main open cut. The data set is sparse, irregularly spaced and has a highly skewed distribution. An enlarged data set, used for the variography, was obtained by including exploration data from 20 m above and 20 m below the bench. In addition, the blast hole data from the chosen bench were considered as a model of reality. Careful choice of the common semivariogram model for median indicator kriging was necessary. Grade tonnage curves from median <b>indicator</b> kriging and <b>full</b> <b>indicator</b> kriging were compared with one another and with the grade tonnage curve of the blast hole data. There was little difference in the grade tonnage curves for the two indicator kriging methods. In both cases the grade tonnage curves fell below that obtained from the blast hole data.

50|$|A pilot {{aiming for}} a 500-foot per minute descent, for example, may find himself {{descending}} too rapidly. He begins to apply up elevator until the vertical speed indicator shows 500 feet per minute. However, because the vertical speed indicator lags the actual vertical speed, the pilot is actually descending at much less than 500 feet per minute. The pilot then begins applying down elevator until the vertical speed <b>indicator</b> <b>reads</b> 500 feet per minute, starting the cycle over. It's harder than it might seem to stabilize the vertical speed because the airspeed also constantly changes.|$|R

50|$|Before using a VOR {{indicator}} for {{the first}} time, it can be tested and calibrated at an airport with a VOR test facility, or VOT. A VOT differs from a VOR in that it replaces the variable directional signal with another omnidirectional signal, in a sense transmitting a 360° radial in all directions. The NAV receiver is tuned to the VOT frequency, then the OBS is rotated until the needle is centred. If the <b>indicator</b> <b>reads</b> within four degrees of 000 with the FROM flag visible or 180 with the TO flag visible, it is considered usable for navigation. The FAA requires testing and calibration of a VOR indicator no more than 30 days before any flight under IFR.|$|R
