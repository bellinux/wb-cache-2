2500|$|Little Buffalo Creek and Holman Lake {{create an}} {{excellent}} habitat {{for a great}} variety of wild animals. The waters of the creek and lake are warm. This makes for an ideal habitat for crappie, sunfish and largemouth bass. The bass will eat just about anything in the lake. They prey on ducklings, crayfish, frogs and even other fish. Holman Lake has a very large population of yellow perch. The population of the yellow perch has been managed by the stocking of walleye, muskellunge, and channel catfish. This large population with such a tremendous variety of fish has made Holman Lake a very popular fishing lake. Holman Lake is a designated [...] "Big Bass Lake". This means that the only fish anglers are allowed to keep must be at least 15inches long with a <b>daily</b> <b>limit</b> of 4 bass.|$|E

2500|$|Holman Lake is {{open year}} round to fishing and boating. It is a [...] "Big Bass Lake"; only bass [...] or longer may be kept, with a <b>daily</b> <b>limit</b> of four per angler. The lake has a native {{population}} of largemouth bass, catfish and panfish. It is stocked [...] with brook, brown and rainbow trout. The high population of yellow perch {{is controlled by}} the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission by stocking muskellunge and walleye. All of these fish are targeted by recreational fisherman on a year-round basis, from shore, boat and during the winter months on the ice cover. Electric-powered, gas-powered, and non-powered boats are permitted on the waters of Holman Lake with current registration from any state. Although gas-powered boats are permitted, the engine(s) are not allowed to be used. They must be powered by an electric motor or rowing. The lake is open in the winter for ice skating and ice fishing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{regulation}} of anglers {{in the park}} also evolved significantly since the park's creation. [...] Original angling was a subsistence affair to fill a camp's larder and feed visitors to the park. [...] Although fishing methods were limited to hook and line early in the park's history, there were no limits. In the 1920s, a <b>daily</b> <b>limit</b> of 20 fish was set. [...] This was reduced to 10, then five and then three in 1954. [...] Limits have fluctuated based on waters and species ever since then. [...] Until 1969, bait {{could be used in}} most waters. In 1950, the Madison and Firehole rivers were designated as [...] "Fly Fishing Only". The lower Gibbon River was given that designation in 1968. [...] In 1970, regulation turned to minimum size limits for cutthroat trout and there began an era where the emphasis of regulation became the protection of native species. [...] Angling permits were free in the park until 1994, when a $10 fee was charged for a seven-day permit. In 2013, the National Park Service began allowing unlimited taking of non-native species in some waters and required mandatory killing of rainbow and brook trout caught in the Lamar River drainage to protect native cutthroat trout.|$|E
2500|$|The lake also {{supports}} a strong sport fishery. While commercial fishing declined, sport fishing has remained. The deep cool waters that spawn the best fishing {{is in the}} Canadian side of the lake. As a result, a fishing boat that crosses the international border triggers the security concerns of border crossings and fishermen are advised to have their passport. If their boat crosses the invisible border line in the lake, upon returning to the American shore, passengers will have to [...] "drive to a local government reporting station and pose for pictures" [...] to Customs officers by videophone. There are cumbersome rules for fishing boat operators as well, {{who will have to}} fax passenger personal information to a government agency an hour before leaving; officers will be watching and doing spot checks from patrol boats and government aircraft". Authorities in 2008 from the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission have tried stocking the lake with brown trout in an effort to build what's called a put-grow-and-take fishery. There was a report that charter boat fishing increased substantially on the American side, from 46 to 638 charter boats in operation in Ohio alone, during a period from 1975 to 1985 as pollution levels declined, and after populations of walleye increased substantially in the lake. In 1984, Ohio sold 27,000 nonresident fishing permits, and sport fishing was described as big business. In 1992, there were accounts of fishermen catching 8, 10, and 12 pound walleyes, and that the [...] "runt of a five-man <b>daily</b> <b>limit</b> of 25 walleye might be a nuisance of 5 pounds."

2500|$|Stolle, Sack and Thomasius define binge {{drinking}} as episodic excessive drinking. There is currently no worldwide consensus {{on how many}} drinks constitute a [...] "binge", but in the United States, the term has been described in academic research to mean consuming five or more standard drinks (male), or four or more drinks (female), over a 2-hour period. In 2015, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, citing the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, defines {{binge drinking}} as [...] "a pattern of drinking that brings a person’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 grams percent or above. This typically happens when men consume 5 or more drinks, and when women consume 4 or more drinks, in about 2 hours." [...] and estimated that about 16% of American adults met these binge drinking criteria four times per month. One 2001 definition from the publication Psychology of Addictive Behavior states that 5 drinks for men and 4 drinks for women must be consumed on one occasion {{at least once in}} a two-week period for it to be classed as binge drinking. This is colloquially known as the [...] "5/4 definition", and depending on the source, the timeframe can vary. In the United Kingdom, binge drinking is defined by one academic publication as drinking more than twice the <b>daily</b> <b>limit,</b> that is, drinking eight units or more for men or six units or more for women (roughly equivalent to five or four American standard drinks, respectively). In Australia, binge drinking is also known as risky single occasion drinking (RSOD) and can be classified by the drinking of seven or more standard drinks (by males) and 5 or more standard drinks (by females) within a single day. When BEACH (Bettering the Evaluation of care and health) conducted a study which gathered information of people over the age of 18, it defined binge drinkers as those who consumed six or more standard drinks on one occasion whether that be weekly or monthly.|$|E
