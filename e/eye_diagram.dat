500|$|Although no {{maximum length}} for an HDMI cable is specified, signal {{attenuation}} (dependent on the cable's construction quality and conducting materials) limits usable lengths {{in practice and}} certification is difficult to achieve for lengths beyond 13m. HDMI 1.3 defines two cable categories: Category 1-certified cables, which have been tested at 74.5MHz (which would include resolutions such as 720p60 and 1080i60), and Category 2-certified cables, which have been tested at 340MHz (which would include resolutions such as 1080p60 and 2160p30).

50|$|The notable {{advantage}} {{of this approach is}} two-fold. First, precisely the same electronic circuits and components that are used to produce the BER measurements are also used to produce the <b>eye</b> <b>diagram</b> display. This ensures that the differences between how two separate circuits would interpret the signal - owing to their unique frequency responses - are eliminated and there is perfect correlation between BER results and <b>eye</b> <b>diagram</b> results, which is very important and impossible to do otherwise. Second, the mechanism invented by Tom Waschura to create the <b>eye</b> <b>diagram</b> utilizes a counter and a variable-threshold comparator (in some instances, two comparators) to image the eye. By selecting different threshold levels in combination with certain time delays, individual pixels of the <b>eye</b> <b>diagram</b> are evaluated by counting the number of bits that exceed the threshold - {{or in the case of}} dual thresholds, are in between two thresholds. This capability is important because the speed of the evaluation is dependent on the clocking speed of the transmission that is often hundreds of times faster than the sampling rate of an oscilloscope. This is an important advantage in signal integrity test applications, where it is difficult to capture low-probability occurring events.|$|E
50|$|By {{combining}} eye diagramming techniques with precisely positioned BER measurements, Jim Waschura {{invented a}} technique of sweeping {{the interior of}} an <b>eye</b> <b>diagram</b> to curve-fit measurements to mathematical models representing the interior slopes of the <b>eye</b> <b>diagram</b> for random and deterministic effects. This technique is notable because many performance criteria are {{defined in terms of}} the eye opening at a specified probability level (e.g. 1E-12), that requires an impossible amount of data acquisition to measure directly. This technique allows for modest extrapolations to be performed to evaluate the 1E-12 eye opening with measurements that are acquired in only a few minutes.|$|E

50|$|BER and jitter are {{functions}} of the entire MGT connection, including the MGTs themselves, their serial lines, their reference clocks, their power supplies, and the digital systems that create and consume their parallel data.

50|$|At {{these new}} multigigabit/s bit rates, the bit period is {{shorter than the}} flight time; echoes of {{previous}} pulses can arrive at the receiver {{on top of the}} main pulse and corrupt it. In communication engineering this is called intersymbol interference (ISI). In signal integrity engineering it is usually called eye closure (a reference to the clutter {{in the center of a}} type of oscilloscope trace called an <b>eye</b> <b>diagram).</b> When the bit period is shorter than the flight time, elimination of reflections using classic microwave techniques like matching the electrical impedance of the transmitter to the interconnect, the sections of interconnect to each other, and the interconnect to the receiver, is crucial. Termination with a source or load is a synonym for matching at the two ends. The interconnect impedance that can be selected is constrained by the impedance of free space (~377 Ω), a geometric form factor and by the square root of the relative dielectric constant of the stripline filler (typically FR-4, with a relative dielectric constant of ~4). Together, these properties determine the trace's characteristic impedance. 50 Ω is a convenient choice for single-end lines, and 100 ohm for differential.|$|E
