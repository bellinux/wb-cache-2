5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual camera system creators {{have to deal}} with a world that is {{interactive}} and unpredictable. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> know where the player's character {{is going to be in}} the next few seconds; therefore, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> plan the shots as a film maker would do. To solve this issue, the system relies on certain rules or artificial intelligence to select the most appropriate shots.|$|E
5|$|Championships {{without a}} {{specific}} start or end date {{are not included}} as it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> calculate the specific number of dates for a reign.|$|E

50|$|As soon as {{the film}} was wound forwards, the light meter would switch on. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> switch it off manually, so {{the only way to}} {{conserve}} battery would be to delay advancing the film until the next exposure. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> attach a winder or motor to the camera.|$|R

5|$|Juveniles have a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings, {{and less}} {{white in the}} tail feathers. They can also be {{distinguished}} by their constant begging calls. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> tell the sexes apart until the male's bill begins to darken. This begins when the male is around one year old, and is complete some time {{after two years of}} age.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} Veddhas {{are physically}} related {{to people in}} South India and early populations of Southeast Asia. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> ascertain what languages that they originally spoke as Vedda language is considered diverged from its original source.|$|E
5|$|After Calabi–Yau {{manifolds}} {{had entered}} physics {{as a way}} to compactify extra dimensions, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, Lance Dixon, Wolfgang Lerche, Cumrun Vafa, and Nick Warner noticed that given such a compactification of string theory, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, two different versions of string theory called type IIA string theory and type IIB can be compactified on completely different Calabi–Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and {{the relationship between the two}} physical theories is called mirror symmetry.|$|E

5|$|Although less used, the {{separability}} {{assumption is}} considered more general because every stochastic process has a separable version. It {{is also used}} when it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> construct a stochastic process in a Skorokhod space. For example, separability is assumed when constructing and studying random fields, where the collection of random variables is now indexed by sets other than the real line such as -dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E
5|$|As of 2009, {{passengers}} of two-axle vehicles (such as {{cars and}} motorcycles) pay tolls of 65¢ in cash or 55¢ if Pikepass is used. Drivers in vehicles {{with more than}} two axles, such as truckers, pay higher tolls. Tolls are collected at the single barrier toll plaza between the US-177 and Roff interchanges. Due to the partial interchanges, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> legally use the turnpike without passing through this toll plaza. The toll is the same regardless of the point of entry or exit.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a nominal roll or other records listing the Australians {{who took part in the}} D-Day landings, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} the exact number involved. However, it has been estimated that about 3,000 Australian military personnel and merchant seamen participated in the operation. The total number of Australians killed on 6 June was 14, of whom 12 were RAAF airmen and two were members of the RAN.|$|E

5|$|Halley has {{probably}} been in its current orbit for 16,000–200,000 years, although it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> numerically integrate its orbit {{for more than a}} few tens of apparitions, and close approaches before 837 AD can only be verified from recorded observations. The non-gravitational effects can be crucial; as Halley approaches the Sun, it expels jets of sublimating gas from its surface, which knock it very slightly off its orbital path. These orbital changes cause delays in its perihelion of four days, average.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{estimate}} {{the chances of}} another very bright Kreutz comet arriving in the near future, but given that at least 10 have reached naked eye visibility over the last 200 years, another great comet from the Kreutz family seems almost certain to arrive at some point. Comet White–Ortiz–Bolelli in 1970 reached an apparent magnitude of 1. In December 2011, Kreutz sungrazer C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) survived its perihelion passage and had an apparent magnitude of −3.|$|E
5|$|Items of {{jewellery}} {{made before}} the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 are regarded as heirlooms owned by the Queen in right of the Crown and pass from one monarch to the next in perpetuity. Objects made later, including official gifts, can also be added {{to that part of}} the Royal Collection at the sole discretion of the monarch. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> say how much the collection is worth because the jewels have a rich and unique history, and they will likely never be sold on the open market.|$|E

5|$|Kuhn {{denied that}} it is ever {{possible}} to isolate the hypothesis being tested from {{the influence of the}} theory in which the observations are grounded, and he argued that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> evaluate competing paradigms independently. More than one logically consistent construct can paint a usable likeness of the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. Neither provides a standard by which the other can be judged, so there is no clear way to measure scientific progress across paradigms.|$|E
5|$|Larry's {{interactions}} with key women {{are accompanied by}} a detailed image of whomever he is speaking with, unlike other non-player characters. With {{the exception of the}} prostitute, each of the women shun Larry at first, but respond favorably to gifts of varying sorts. Although it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> woo all of the women, giving gifts is needed to advance to the game's final area, the hotel penthouse. To this end, money is essential to advance through the game. The only available method of augmenting Larry's funds is to gamble in the casino, playing blackjack and slots.|$|E
5|$|Sōryūs {{second wave}} {{consisted}} of nine A6M Zeros and seventeen D3As. The former attacked Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay, losing one Zero to American anti-aircraft guns. On the return trip, the Zero pilots {{claimed to have}} shot down two American aircraft while losing two of their own. The D3As attacked various ships in Pearl Harbor, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> identify which aircraft attacked which ship. Two of them were shot down during the attack.|$|E

5|$|This {{episode was}} first {{publicly}} released {{as one of}} the extras in the NTSC season 1 DVD box set, which were not available with the previously-released individual volumes. As the PAL box set lacks extras, the episode was not made available on DVD in PAL regions. The episode was released with audio commentary from the creators, which unlike commentary on other episodes in the season <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> disable on the DVD set. On June 14, 2010, the unaired pilot was made available with and without commentary for the first time via the iTunes Store.|$|E
5|$|Three of the {{observers}} eventually died of {{conditions that are}} known to be promoted by radiation: Graves of a heart attack 20 years later at age 55; Cieslicki of acute myeloid leukemia 19 years later at age 42; and Young of aplastic anemia and bacterial infection of the heart lining 27 years later at age 83. Although some of those deaths were probably latent stochastic (random) effects of the accident, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> draw any definitive conclusions from such a small sample set.|$|E
5|$|Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is {{organised}} as {{a registered}} association. This means that Real Madrid {{is owned by}} its supporters who elect the club president. The club president cannot invest his own money into the club and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through merchandise sales, television rights and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> purchase shares in the club, but only membership. The members of Real Madrid, called socios, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club. As of 2010, the club has 60,000 socios. At {{the end of the}} 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.|$|E
