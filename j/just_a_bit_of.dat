[...] In his mixed review of Worlds, Derek Staples of Consequence of Sound praised “Flicker” and “Goodbye to a World” for highlighting [...] "Robinson’s more intricate big room capabilities" [...] in an album where [...] "Robinson hides his former bass-fueled self behind the album’s sheen."

500|$|After its release, Evita {{garnered}} critical appreciation. Zach Conner from Time magazine commented, [...] "It's {{a relief}} to say that Evita is pretty damn fine, well cast and handsomely visualized. Madonna once again confounds our expectations. She plays Evita with a poignant weariness and has more than <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> star quality. Love or hate Madonna-Eva, she is a magnet for all eyes." [...] Madonna won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for the role. She released three singles from the Evita soundtrack album, including [...] "You Must Love Me" [...] (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1997) and [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina". Madonna was later presented with the Artist Achievement Award by Tony Bennett at the 1996 Billboard Music Awards. On October 14, 1996, Madonna gave birth to Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon, her daughter with Leon. Biographer Mary Cross writes that although Madonna was often ill during the filming and worried that her pregnancy would harm the film, she reached some important personal goals: [...] "Now 38 years old, Madonna had at last triumphed on screen and achieved her dream of having a child, both in the same year. She had reached another turning point in her career, reinventing herself and her image with the public." [...] Her relationship with Carlos Leon ended in May 1997; she declared that they were [...] "better off as best friends." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for the Hartford Courant, Malcolm Johnson stated, [...] "Against all odds, this long-delayed {{film version}} {{turns out to}} be a labor of love for {{director}} Alan Parker and for his stars, the reborn Madonna, the new superstar Antonio Banderas, the protean veteran Jonathan Pryce." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing [...] "Parker's visuals enliven the music, and Madonna and Banderas bring it passion. By the end of the film we feel like we've had our money's worth, and we're sure Evita has." [...] On the syndicated television program Siskel & Ebert & the Movies, Ebert and his colleague Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating. Siskel, in his review for the Chicago Tribune, wrote, [...] "Director Alan Parker has mounted this production well, which is more successful as spectacle than anything else." [...] According to Time magazine's Richard Corliss, [...] "This Evita is not just a long, complex music video; it works and breathes like a real movie, with characters worthy of our affection and deepest suspicions." [...] Critic Zach Conner commented, [...] "It's a relief to say that Evita is pretty damn fine, well-cast, and handsomely visualized. Madonna once again confounds our expectations. She plays Evita with a poignant weariness and has more than <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> star quality. Love or hate Madonna-Eva, she is a magnet for all eyes." ...|$|E
500|$|Criminal {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. Andy Gill of The Independent called {{it one of}} the highlights of Femme Fatale, along with [...] "Till the World Ends". Gill also said that the album sounds more programmed than natural, commenting that [...] "indeed, such is the shock when the final track, 'Criminal', opens with a little folksong-style flute and guitar figure that one's immediate reaction is that a Midlake soundfile has been accidentally appended to Britney's running-order." [...] Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush gave the song four stars, explaining that [...] "Only Brit can make a flute sound sexy. Seriously, few pop stars can pull off a flute and Brit does it with ease." [...] Aaron-Spencer Charles of Metro said that [...] "the verses, chorus and bridge all work perfectly for Ms. Spears, showing that she still has it from all those years ago." [...] Erin Thompson of the Seattle Weekly called it her best vocal performance of the album, and added that [...] "it has a spark and a mischievous sass to it – and these days anytime Britney shows even <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> her old liveliness and independence, we like it." [...] Rudy Klapper of Sputnikmusic commented the song [...] "isn't exactly the progressive stylings of a Janelle Monáe , but damn if it’s not catchy and interesting." [...] The A.V. Clubs Genevieve Koski claimed that the album [...] "s not all dance-floor narcotics", adding that [...] "Inside Out", [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] and [...] "Criminal" [...] "add texture to the wall-to-wall synth waves and booty bass." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said the production of Femme Fatale is [...] "polished, intriguing and – best of all – fun", exemplifying [...] "Inside Out", the piano breakdown in [...] "Big Fat Bass" [...] and the flute in [...] "Criminal".|$|E

Brett explained in a 2011 interview: [...] "In the very early days, everything was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a shock ... to us; it was like, it was either a shock, if it, if it actually happened, or it was, it seemed kind of absurd if someone was, ah, you know, putting an idea forward about how things would go".|$|E

The heating equipment was non-functional; a battlefield forge stood in the unit. The bunker was , with one small opening and an iron door leading to room one. New prisoners were made to live there for days, even weeks.

His role as Christoffer {{earned him}} the Zulu Award for Best Actor and Bodil and Robert Festival nominations for Best Actor. Eddie Cockrell of Variety noted his [...] "rigid countenance" [...] in an [...] "outstanding" [...] performance. The same year, Mikkelsen achieved his first widely acclaimed international success as Le Chiffre in the twenty-first James Bond film, Casino Royale. Mikkelsen {{has said that he}} so easily won the part that even Daniel Craig asked him if he had slept with someone in order to be cast. He said of the casting, [...] "They'd done their homework, seen my stuff, so it was fine, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> anti-climax, because I was so ready to do more for them, but it was … shrugs... you're in." [...] He also stated that because he was already a big film star in Denmark at the time, that the international role did not really change much. Roger Ebert noted the suspense during Mikkelsen's scene with Bond during the extended poker game, in which Le Chiffre weeps blood from his left eye. David Edelstein of New York Magazine said [...] "Mikkelsen clicks his rectangular plaques as if he's a new breed of praying mantis. He's bloodcurdling." [...] In 2006, Mikkelsen also took the lead role in the Danish drama After the Wedding, which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Film. He won the Palm Springs International Film Festival Award for Best Actor and a European Film Award for Best Actor nomination for his performance. The New York Times remarked that on the Hollywood scene, Mikkelsen has [...] "become a reliable character actor with an intriguing mug" [...] but stated that on the domestic front [...] "he is something else: a star, an axiom, a face of the resurgent Danish cinema." ...|$|E
