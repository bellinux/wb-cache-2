25|$|The {{graticule}} is {{a grid of}} squares {{that serve}} as reference marks for measuring the displayed trace. These markings, whether located directly on the screen or on a removable plastic filter, usually consist of a 1cm grid with closer tick marks (often at 2mm) on the centre vertical and horizontal axis. One <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> ten major divisions across the screen; the number of vertical major divisions varies. Comparing the grid markings with the waveform permits one to measure both voltage (vertical axis) and time (horizontal axis). Frequency can also be determined by measuring the waveform period and calculating its reciprocal.|$|E
25|$|Fairly {{straightforward}} statistics provide {{estimates of}} whether associations between genes on lists {{are greater than}} what one would expect by chance. These statistics are interesting, even if they represent a substantial oversimplification of {{what is really going}} on. Here is an example. Suppose there are 10,000 genes in an experiment, only 50 (0.5%) of which play a known role in making cholesterol. The experiment identifies 200 regulated genes. Of those, 40 (20%) turn out to be on a list of cholesterol genes as well. Based on the overall prevalence of the cholesterol genes (0.5%) one expects an average of 1 cholesterol gene for every 200 regulated genes, that is, 0.005 times 200. This expectation is an average, so one <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> more than one some of the time. The question becomes how often we would see 40 instead of 1 due to pure chance.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of the release of Ang Lee's Hulk, screenwriter James Schamus was {{planning}} a sequel, featuring the Grey Hulk. He was also considering the Leader and the Abomination as villains. Marvel wanted the Abomination because he would be an actual threat to the Hulk, unlike General Ross. During the filming of Hulk, producer Avi Arad had a target May 2005 theatrical release date. On January 18, 2006 Arad confirmed Marvel Studios would be providing the money for The Incredible Hulks production budget, with Universal distributing, because Universal did not meet the deadline for filming a sequel. Marvel felt {{it would be better to}} deviate from Ang Lee's style to continue the franchise, arguing his film was like a parallel universe one-shot comic book, and their next film needed to be, in Kevin Feige's words, [...] "really starting the Marvel Hulk franchise". Producer Gale Anne Hurd also felt the film had to meet what [...] "everyone <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> from having read the comics and seen the TV series".|$|E

'What we expected to achieve was never realistic given the timetable or what unfolded on the ground'".|$|E

2500|$|Morocco's trade {{imbalance}} rose from 86 billion to 118 billion dirhams between 2006 and 2007 – a 26.6% increase {{bringing the total}} amount to 17% of GDP. The Caisse de Dépôt et de Gestion forecasts that if imports continue to rise faster than exports, the disparity could reach 21% of GDP. Foreign Trade Minister Abdellatif Maâzouz said earlier in September {{that members of the}} government have agreed to a plan focused on four major areas: a concerted export development strategy, the regulation of imports, market and economic monitoring, and the adaptation of regulations and working practices. The plan, Maâzouz said, [...] "will enable us to redress the external trade situation and to reduce Morocco’s trade deficit." [...] The minister added that he <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a reversal of the imbalance by 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The {{landscape}} of Lewis' native Ireland, in particular Ulster, played {{a large part}} {{in the creation of}} the Narnian landscape. In his essay On Stories, Lewis wrote [...] "I have seen landscapes, notably in the Mourne Mountains and southwards which under a particular light made me feel that at any moment a giant might raise his head over the next ridge". In a letter to his brother, Lewis would later confide [...] "that part of Rostrevor which overlooks Carlingford Lough is my idea of Narnia". Although in adult life Lewis lived in England, he returned to Northern Ireland often and retained fond memories of the Irish scenery, saying [...] "I yearn to see County Down in the snow; one almost <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a march of dwarfs dashing past. How I long to break into a world where such things were true." ...|$|E

2500|$|A 2013 {{editorial}} by Steven P. Novella and David Colquhoun {{found that}} the inconsistency of results of acupuncture studies (i.e. acupuncture relieved pain in some conditions but had no effect in other very similar conditions) suggests false positive results, which {{may be caused by}} factors like biased study designs, poor blinding, and the classification of electrified needles (a type of TENS) as a form of acupuncture. The same editorial suggested that given the inability to find consistent results despite more than 3,000 studies of acupuncture, the treatment seems to be a placebo effect and the existing equivocal positive results are noise one <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> after a large number of studies are performed on an inert therapy. The editorial concluded that the best controlled studies showed a clear pattern, in which the outcome does not rely upon needle location or even needle insertion, and since [...] "these variables are those that define acupuncture, the only sensible conclusion is that acupuncture does not work." ...|$|E

Show {{compassion}} To a faithful lover"). Meanwhile, Elena asks Serano to find her father, whom she <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> before he goes off to fight; Serano leaves. Uberto/King James then approaches Elena and declares his love, but she tells him she loves Malcolm: (Duet, leading to a trio: Elena and Uberto: Alla ragion deh rieda / [...] "Ah! may your agitated and overburdended soul Return to reason's control"). Nevertheless, Uberto gives Elena a ring he says the King gave him, and emphasizes that it will see her through any danger. He prepares to leave, but Rodrigo steps forward, having overheard their exchange: (Duet: Qual pena in me già desta / [...] "What distress in my fatal misfortune"". This becomes a trio with Rodrigo's: Misere mie pupille! / [...] "O my wretched eyes!".) [...] Overwhelmed with rage and jealousy, Rodrigo orders his men to reveal themselves and kill this stranger. Elena pleads with Rodrigo's men, and Rodrigo decides to duel with Uberto himself. The two exit; Elena, trying in vain to calm them, follows.|$|E
