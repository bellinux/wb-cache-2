5|$|The {{increasing}} {{focus on}} Women's Rights in the United States during the 1980s {{focused attention on}} the fact that many drugs being prescribed for women had never actually been tested in women of child-bearing potential, and that there was a relative paucity of basic research into women's health. In response to this the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) in 1990 to address these inequities. In 1993 the National Institutes of Health Revitalisation Act officially reversed US policy by requiring NIH funded phase III clinical trials to include women. This resulted in an increase in women recruited into research studies. The next phase was the specific funding of large scale epidemiology studies and clinical trials focussing on women's health such as the Women's Health Initiative (1991), the largest disease prevention study conducted in the US. Its role was to study the major causes of death, disability and frailty in older women. Despite this apparent progress, women remain underepresented. In 2006 women accounted for less than 25% of clinical trials published in 2004, A follow up study by the same authors five years later found little evidence of improvement. Another study found between 10–47% of women in heart disease clinical trials, despite the prevalence of heart disease in women.

25|$|Socioeconomic factors {{significantly}} affect {{whether or not}} individuals develop the habit of voting. The most important socioeconomic factor affecting voter turnout is education. The more educated a person is, the more likely {{he or she is}} to vote, even controlling for other factors that are closely associated with education level, such as income and class. Income has some effect independently: wealthier {{people are more likely to}} vote, regardless of their educational background. There is some debate over the effects of ethnicity, race, and gender. In the past, these factors unquestionably influenced turnout in many nations, but nowadays the consensus among political scientists is that these factors have little effect in Western democracies when education and income differences are taken into account. However, since different ethnic groups typically have different levels of education and income, there are important differences in turnout between such groups in many societies. Other demographic factors have an important influence: young people are <b>far</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> vote than the elderly. Occupation has little effect on turnout, with the notable exception of higher voting rates among government employees in many countries.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} three decades, the nature {{of work in the}} U. S. economy has changed dramatically. Workers are <b>far</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> today <b>to</b> work in {{manufacturing}} jobs and much more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be engaged in services that require them to be “knowledge workers ” (U. S. Department of Commerce, 1991). The new economy requires all workers, not just managers, to be thinkers, problem solvers, and decision-makers, and nearly all work is becoming increasingly seen as technical in nature (Barley & Orr, 1997). The New Work Order (Gee, 1997) calls on these knowledge workers to use and continually evolve their knowledge and skill within organizations that must respond to markets and product cycles that are becoming faster and faster. There is concern among the companies that drive the new economy, especially those that are involved in emerging technologies and the Internet, that schools are not producing the kinds of workers that can fill the jobs needed for the next decade. A study published by Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network (1999), a partnership of industry leaders in the area, found that the current workforce gap is between 31 and 37 percent of industry demand, at an estimated annual cost to businesses of $ 3 - 4 billion.

40|$|A {{critical}} void in {{the research}} on women’s underrepresentation in elective office is {{an analysis of the}} initial decision to run for office. Based on data from our Citizen Political Ambition Study, the first large-scale national survey of potential candidates, we examine the process by which women and men emerge as candidates for public office. We find that women who share the same personal characteristics and professional credentials as men express significantly lower levels of political ambition to hold elective office. Two factors explain this gender gap: first, women are <b>far</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than men <b>to</b> be encouraged to run for office; second, women are significantly <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than men <b>to</b> view themselves as qualified to run. Our findings call into question the leading theoretical explanations for women’s numeric underrepresentation and indicate that, because of vestiges of traditional sex-role socialization, prospects for gender parity in U.

5000|$|Before the 20th century, New Orleans’ neighborhoods were {{of mixed}} race, but a {{combination}} of Jim Crow laws, racially segregated public housing, unequal educational opportunities, white flight, and unequal employment opportunities led to a racially segregated city.

PhD Elizabeth Fussell explains how unequal opportunities based on race contributed to economic and geographic disparities in New Orleans over the years: explicitly unequal treatment of those racial groups has been reproduced through an interlocking system of unequal educational opportunities, residential segregation, and blacks were consistently <b>far</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than whites <b>to</b> complete secondary school, even to present. The effect of racial educational inequity during the [...] "human capital century" [...] has been to diminish the labor-market opportunities and life changes of the individuals that lag behind.

The storm worsened population loss and changed the demographics of the city, resulting in an increased proportion of whites population and decreased proportion of black individuals in the years following.|$|R
500|$|The {{benefits}} {{for children to}} maintain relationships with both parents have been repeatedly shown in research.

In addition, children in joint custody arrangements report feeling closer to both parents than children in sole custody arrangements. Joint custody arrangements also appear to benefit the parents. Not only do parents in joint custody arrangements report lower levels of conflict with one another, when compared to those in sole custody arrangements, but joint custody is frequently related to more positive relationships, effective parenting, and lower inter-parental conflict; key factors that ensure a child’s well-being following divorce.

One estimate is that, on present trends, the area affected by drought will double {{by the end of this}} century from 25 % to 50 %, and that while the number of drought periods may not significantly increase, they are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> last for longer, making recovery (herd reconstitution, replenishment of water sources) less dependable. 1 This scenario is consistent with recent trends: the mean annual number of people killed and affected by drought in Eastern Africa, for example, has increased over ten-fold in the past thirty years, from 584 per 100, 000 people in 1974 - 78 to 6067 in 1999 - 2003. 2 However, these are global projections.

Focusing on adults who were living, before the tsunami, in areas that were subsequently severely damaged by the tsunami, better educated males were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> survive the tsunami, but education is not predictive of survival among females.

The much higher rate of suicide amongst males suggests that depression in men might be underreported. One of the core human motives is to seek acceptance by others and avoid rejection. Rejection Sensitivity (RS) has been conceptualized as the cognitive- affective processing disposition to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely respond to cues of rejection {{in the behavior of}} others. RS has been previously linked with the onset and course of depression, butÐas yetÐhas not been investigated longitudinally in a clinical population. We investigated the predictive role of RS to symptom deterioration 6 months after end-of- treatment in 72 male inpatients with depressive spectrum disorder.

Rejection Sensitivity had additional predictive power on BDI scores at 6 months follow-up controlling for BDI scores at end-of-treatment (ΔR 2 =. 095). The results are discussed in terms of the importance of targeting RS during treatment, and highlight the fact that therapeutic follow-up care is paramount.
