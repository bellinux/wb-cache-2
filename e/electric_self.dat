The electric power of the inner sources in the enclosure is considered on the bases of the electric vector potential. The results lead to a new conception {{with respect to the}} energy conversions. They are due to the {{energy exchange}} between magnetic contours by the way of the mutual <b>electric</b> field. The <b>self</b> and the mutual electromagnetic parameters of the magnetic contours are defined: <b>self</b> and mutual <b>electric</b> conductance, <b>self</b> and mutual capacitance. The parameters are closely related with the self and the mutual magnetic flux and with the self and the mutual electric energy of non-conservative electric field.

50|$|The main {{inventor}} of the Mills Violano-Virtuoso was Henry Konrad Sandell, a contemporary of Thomas Edison, {{who was born in}} about 1878. Henry Sandell arrived in the United States from Sweden at the age of about 10 in about 1888. He was granted his first United States patent on the mechanism at the age of 21, in about 1899 and put his proposals and patents before the Mills Novelty Company in about 1903.On 27 March 1905 Henry Sandell filed an application for a United States patent for an <b>electric</b> <b>self</b> playing violin.

40|$|An {{electric}} current flowing around a loop produces {{a magnetic field}} and hence a magnetic flux through the loop. The ratio of the magnetic flux to the {{electric current}} is called the (magnetic) self inductance. Can there be a dual situation with a magnetic current flowing around a loop and producing an electric field and hence an electric flux through the loop? Following the classical electrodynamics laws an {{answer to this question}} should be negative. Nevertheless special spectral properties of magnetic dipolar modes in a quasi- 2 D ferrite disk show there are the double-valued-function loop magnetic currents which may produce eigen electric fields and hence eigen electric fluxes through the loop. In this case one can definitely introduce the notion of the <b>electric</b> <b>self</b> inductance as the ratio of the electric flux to the magnetic current. In this paper we show experimentally that in the magnetic-dipolar-mode ferrite disks there exist eigen electric fluxes. These fluxes are very sensitive to permittivity parameters of materials abutting to the ferrite disk. Dielectric samples above a ferrite disk with a higher permittivity than air confine the electric field closely outside the ferrite, thereby changing the loop magnetic currents and thus transforming the magnetic-dipolar-mode oscillating spectrum...|$|E
40|$|Steam {{turbines}} {{have long}} been used at utilities and in industry to generate power. There are three basic types of steam turbines: condensing, letdown and extraction/condensing. ? Letdown turbines reduce {{the pressure of the}} incoming steam to one or more pressures and generate power very efficiently, assuming that all the letdown steam has a use. Two caveats: Letdown turbines produce power based upon steam requirements and not based upon power requirements, and if all the steam letdown does not have a use, letdown turbines can become a very expensive way of producing electric power. ? Condensing turbines have the ability to handle rapid swings in electrical load. Unfortunately, they can only condense {{a small percentage of the}} steam, usually less than 14 %. Therefore only a small percent of the heat of condensation is available for their use. Also equipment must be used to condense the remaining steam below atmospheric pressure. ? Extraction/condensing turbines both extract steam at a useful temperature and pressure and then condense the remainder of the steam. These units have the ability to load follow also. They are often used in concert with gas turbines to produce the balance of electrical power and to keep a <b>electric</b> <b>self</b> generator from drawing electrical power from the grid. The method for analyzing the cost of the condensing steam produced power is exactly the same in all cases. This paper will attempt to provide a frame work for preliminary economic analysis on electric power generation for condensing steam turbines...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} multi-analysis {{approach}} to rock failure using metric size rock samples. The use of large-scale models permits simulation of the seismic process (including internal rupture on several scales) and utilization of a dense network for {{observation of the}} spatial variations of several physical parameters. The experiments were performed both on solid rock blocks and on concrete blocks with artificial defects, which enabled simulation of internal shear fracture. The number of various precursors appears to rise up to failure, all of them clearly manifest at the stage of a rapid drop in the applied stress (unstable deformation). The experiment suggests that rocks under strain and prior to failure must be characterized by a heterogeneous field of strains. This means that the strain is distributed mosaically, dilatancy does not generate uniformly and areas where it occurs {{are likely to be}} structurally mosaic themselves. To reinforce the prediction of micro- and macrofailure, we have realized simultaneous processing of the obtained data, using sophisticated multidimensional orthogonal functions to represent the different precursors. The possibility to identify the early stages of microfailures and to predict the macrofailure by means of statistical complex parameters derived from data on local deformations, acoustic emissions, elastic waves velocities, <b>electric</b> resistivity and <b>self</b> <b>electric</b> potentials is shown. Despite a considerable dissimilarity in mechanical properties of granite basalt and concrete, the complex parameter proves morphologically identical. Parameter S 1 reveals exponential rise up to failure in all cases, and parameter S 2 is bay-shaped in form, which makes it more promising in terms of prognosis...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to design a 30 m luxury fast sailing {{cruising}} yacht. Comfort and performance are the key words for this design. The parametric study represents the starting point to determine a design guideline and fix the main parameters. Adjustment have been done on these parametrics {{in order to obtain}} the desired shape. Performance has been achieved correcting the hull shape according to stability problem. A limit on the heeling angle of around 20 degree has been fixed in order to feel comfortable during sailing. A Dellenbaugh angle has been worked out and then a WinPP check has been used to understand the speed performance of the yacht. Comfort has been provided analysing form and function for all the items involved in the yacht in order to use the volume in an ergonomic way. The owner may want to show most of the minor harbour to his friends or just don’t have the limit of maximum draft. To supply at this demand a lifting keel has been fitted. The keel represent only one of the automated device which have been introduced in this yacht.

40|$|The goal of any {{particle}} accelerator is {{to optimize the}} transport of a charged particle beam along a set path by confining the beam to a small region close to the design trajectory and directing it accurately along the beamline. To {{do so in the}} simplest fashion, accelerators use a system of magnets that exert approximately linear electromagnetic forces on the charged beam. These electromagnets bend the beam along the desired path, in the case of bending magnets, and constrain the beam to the desired area through alternating focusing and defocusing effects, in the case of quadrupole magnets. We can model the transport of such a beam through transfer matrices representing the actions of the various beamline elements. However, space charge effects, produced from <b>self</b> <b>electric</b> fields within the beam, defocus the beam and must be accounted for in the calculation of beam emittance. We present below the preliminary results of a MATLAB code built to model the transport of a charged particle beam through an accelerator and measure the emittance under the influence of space charge effects. We demonstrate the method of correctly calculating the emittance of a beam under space charge effects using a least square fit to determine the initial properties of the beam given the beam size measured at a specific point after transport...|$|R
40|$|Runaway {{electrons}} {{represent the}} greatest threat to the plasma-facing components of a tokamak when they are highly energetic and constitute a significant fraction of the electron population, a regime which has not been previously accessible in modelling since it requires a nonlinear relativistic treatment. To address this problem, we present an efficient numerical tool called NORSE for the study of runaway-electron momentum-space dynamics. The kinetic equation solved in NORSE includes a fully nonlinear relativistic collision operator, making it possible to consider scenarios where the electric field is comparable to the Dreicer field (or larger), or the electron distribution function is otherwise far from a Maxwellian (which can be the case already in present-day runaway experiments). This capability makes NORSE unique in the field of runaway-electron studies. Using NORSE, we investigate the transition to a regime where the entire electron population experiences continuous acceleration, so-called electron slide-away. For the first time, we apply a nonlinear kinetic-equation solver to study the evolution of the electron distribution in an ITER disruption. We use an <b>electric</b> field calculated <b>self</b> consistently, and show that the runaway-electron density becomes substantial, making the nonlinear treatment essential. In addition, we find that Ohmic heating and the rate of heat loss {{play an important role in}} determining the electron dynamics, with the latter affecting the average energy reached by the runaways by several orders of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|It is {{traditionally}} difficult to integrate {{a wide range}} of nanocomponents into macroscopic or mesoscopic scale systems. Traditional methods of nanofabrication use large scale patterning of homogenous layers, or make use of the intrinsic properties of the particles in to bind them together in an uncontrolled fashion. In this dissertation, a method for the rapid, highly controlled deposition of water soluble nanoparticles is demonstrated. Through the use of direct current controlled electrodes in a buffered solution, nanoparticles are pulled from a dilute solution to a complementary binding surface in a few seconds where they form a single layer. By repeated processing steps we are able to rapidly fabricate multilayered structures using different nanoparticles, making use of both overall directed assembly and the local self assembly of the particles themselves. Because we are able to control the particle concentration, we can effectively control the particle binding rate at the deposition surface. Described in detail is a method for characterizing the deposition process to determine both the optimal parameters (in terms of deposition time and current) for a given particle type, and methods to determine the level of interparticle self binding. Optical fluorescent imaging and electron microscopy were used extensively to characterize the rate of particle accumulation both as a function of current and time for a single deposition, and for the overall process through subsequent layers. The <b>electric</b> field assisted <b>self</b> assembly work was carried out for 40 nm and 200 nm biotin/streptavidin coated particles, as well as particles covered in various DNA sequences, quantum dots, and gold particles. Particle deposition profiles across the electrode are also discussed, with the root causes for the observed pattern explained using various electric field deposition from this work, as well as some supporting experiments from tangentially related experiments. These experimental results are compared to various simulated systems. Finally some preliminary work on long range, high voltage, high conductivity dielectrophoresis systems is discussed with an eye towards fully integrated sample analysis system...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{simulation}} plays a {{major role}} in the design and operation of plasma devices. A storage ring of the Figure 8 -type is proposed for the accumulation of charged particles with beam energies around 100 keV. The simulation for charged particle motion in small toroidal sectors is actually studied. Charged particles move under the influence of the Lorentz force produced by external magnetic fields and by <b>self</b> <b>electric</b> fields. r r d i d(mv) r i r r = vi, = q(E + vi × B) (1) dt dt To simulate the evolution of charged particle traces, the Particle In Cell (PIC) method is used and the space charge effect is taken into account by the Cloud In Cell(CIC) method. Fig. 1 shows the 2 d example of charge division at mesh points in circular symmetric coordinate system. The figure above shows the potential and electric field distributions at the mesh points in one of the cross sections and can be considered as check for this simulation code. To obtain that the homogenous charge distribution was assumed. And the plot of electric field shows 1 /r dependence outside the beam and linear decreasing curve inside beam. The figure below shows the graph indicating drift of particles along circumference of the vessel, which can be minimized with higher magnetic field. In 3 d toroidal geometry extra toroidal angle come into picture as third coordinate. The potential is obtained at the mesh points either by using the Fourier Transform Method or by explicitly solving the matrix of linear equations. The software FFTW can be employed while making use of Fourier Transform Method and of special functions like Bessel and Legendre polynoms which are to be used to define boundary conditions. Alternatively potential can also be obtained by using the 7 point Finite Difference method in toroidal geometry. For their simulations following parameters were used...|$|R
40|$|The {{physics of}} {{partially}} neutralized plasmas is largely unexplored, {{partly because of}} the difficulty of confining such plasmas. Plasmas are confined in a stellarator without the need for a plasma current, and regardless of the degree of neutralization. The Columbia Non-neutral Torus (CNT) is a stellarator dedicated to the study of non-neutral, and partially neutralized plasmas. This thesis describes the first systematic studies of plasmas of arbitrary neutrality. The degree of neutralization of the plasma can be parameterized through the quantity η ≡ |n_e - Z n_i|/|n_e + Z n_i|. In CNT, η can be varied continuously from pure electron (η = 1) to quasi-neutral (η ≈ 0) by adjusting the neutral pressure in the chamber, which controls the volumetric ionization rate. Pure electron plasmas are in macroscopically stable equilibria, and have strong <b>self</b> <b>electric</b> potentials dictated by the emitter filament bias voltage on the magnetic axis. As η decreases, the plasma potential decouples from the emitter, and spontaneous fluctuations begin to appear. Partially neutralized plasmas (10 ^- 3 < η < 10 ^- 1) generally exhibit multi-mode oscillations in CNT. However, when magnetized ions are present, the electron-rich plasma oscillates at a single dominant mode (20 - 100 kHz). As the plasma approaches quasi-neutrality (η < 10 ^- 5), it also reverts to single mode behavior (1 - 20 kHz). A parametric characterization of the single mode fluctuations detected in plasmas of arbitrary neutrality is presented in this thesis along with measurements of the spatial structure of the oscillations. The single mode fluctuations observed for η ≈ 0. 01 to 0. 8 are identified as an ion resonant instability propagating close to the E × B velocity of the plasma. The experiments also show that these oscillations present a poloidal mode number m = 1, and a toroidal number n = 0, which is identical to the spatial structure of the diocotron instability in pure-toroidal traps, and implies that the ion-driven instability breaks parallel force balance and the conservation of poloidal flux in CNT. The low frequency oscillations detected in the quasi-neutral regime are a global instability convected by the E × B flow of the plasma. In this case, the mode aligns almost perfectly with the field lines, and presents a resonant m = 3 poloidal structure...|$|R
