5|$|Historically, equestrians <b>honed</b> {{their skills}} through games and races. Equestrian sports {{provided}} entertainment for crowds and <b>honed</b> the excellent horsemanship {{that was needed}} in battle. Many sports, such as dressage, eventing and show jumping, have origins in military training, which were focused on control and balance of both horse and rider. Other sports, such as rodeo, developed from practical skills such as those needed on working ranches and stations. Sport hunting from horseback evolved from earlier practical hunting techniques. Horse racing of all types evolved from impromptu competitions between riders or drivers. All forms of competition, requiring demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport. The popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries {{has resulted in the}} preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes the ELID (Electrolytic in Process Dressing) {{ultrasonic}} <b>honing</b> system, and conducts simulation for {{the solution}} - acoustic coupling mechanism of electrolyte between the anion and cathode of ELID ultrasonic <b>honing</b> system. Meanwhile, a comparative experiment {{is carried out}} for the ultrasonic <b>honing</b> and ordinary <b>honing.</b> The simulation results {{show that there is}} no obvious increase of the coupling speed of the system’s electrolyte, but the rapid change of local speed, which will accelerate the electrolyte renewal around the electrode, thereby intensifying the mass transfer of reactive ion of the electrochemical double layer, increasing the updating speed of ion concentration and speeding up the electrode reaction process; the intense variations of coupling pressure further enhances the updating speed of the electrolyte; Then the electrolytic parameters, ultrasound parameters and <b>honing</b> parameters obtained by simulation are respectively used to conduct experiments of ELID-ultrasound <b>honing,</b> ultrasound <b>honing</b> and traditional <b>honing</b> for ZrO 2 ceramic. The comparative experiment results show that the machining accuracy of ELID-ultrasonic <b>honing</b> is 10 times of the traditional <b>honing</b> and twice of the ultrasonic honing; the new acoustic system adopted in ELID-ultrasound <b>honing</b> system reduces the amplitude, so the processing efficiency increase is not significant. This ELID-ultrasonic <b>honing</b> system is more suitable for the ultra-precision <b>honing</b> of certain difficult-to-cut materials.  </p...|$|R
