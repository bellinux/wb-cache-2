40|$|The {{elimination}} of all external incisions {{is an important}} step in reducing the invasiveness of surgical procedures. Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is an incision-less surgery and provides explicit benefits such as reducing patient trauma and shortening recovery time. However, technological difficulties impede the widespread utilization of the NOTES method. A novel robotic tool has been developed, which makes NOTES procedures feasible by using multiple <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tool</b> tips. The robotic tool has the capability of entering the body cavity through an orifice or a single incision using a flexible articulated positioning mechanism and once inserted is not constrained by incisions, allowing for visualization and manipulations throughout the cavity. Multiple <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tool</b> tips of the robotic device initially consist of three end effectors: a grasper, scissors, and an atraumatic Babcock clamp. The tool changer is capable of selecting and switching between the three tools depending on the surgical task using a miniature mechanism driven by micro-motors. The robotic tool is remotely controlled through a joystick and computer interface. In this thesis, the following aspects of this robotic tool will be detailed. The first-generation robot is designed as a conceptual model for implementing a novel mechanism of switching, advancing, and controlling the tool tips using two micro-motors. It is believed that this mechanism achieves a reduction in cumbersome instrument exchanges and can reduce overall procedure time and the risk of inadvertent tissue trauma during exchanges with a natural orifice approach. Also, placing actuators directly at the surgical site enables the robot to generate sufficient force to operate effectively. Mounting the multifunctional robot on the distal end of an articulating tube provides freedom from restriction on the robot kinematics and helps solve some of the difficulties otherwise faced during surgery using NOTES or related approaches. The second-generation multifunctional robot is then introduced in which the overall size is reduced and two arms provide 2 additional degrees of freedom, resulting in feasibility of insertion through the esophagus and increased dexterity. Improvements are necessary in future iterations of the multifunctional robot; however, the work presented is a proof of concept for NOTES robots capable of abdominal surgical interventions...|$|E
40|$|A {{new era of}} {{robotic surgery}} is poised to begin when {{critical}} patents held by Intuitive Surgical (IS) expire in 2016. IS market dominance for decades {{has led to an}} effective monopoly that will be challenged by several commercial enterprises working on next generation general robotic surgery systems. Robotic surgery has the potential to alleviate the skill-gap between experienced and inexperienced surgeons through the automation of sub-tasks within surgicalprocedures. The primary objective of this dissertation is to explore the process of design itself through the presentation of these devices. The common intention throughout the presented case studies is Frugal Design. Secondarily, this dissertation explores limitations of current surgical automation and addresses the design considerations of hardware modifcations to the daVinci Research Kit which enable automation. Part I (Chapter 1) of this dissertation describes the considerations that make a design frugal and the methodology used by the author across three conceptual examples including:- an inexpensive physical environment for machine learning,- a device for cloud-enabled irrigation optimization, and- an <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tool</b> interface for surgical robotics. Part II of this dissertation presents frugal design case studies for system components that enable an automated silicone-phantom tumorectomy. Chapter 2 provides an overview of existing technology and related work in the field of surgical automation. Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 describe designs for devices that enable automation of the four subtasksinvolved in a tumorectomey: Palpation, Incision, Debridement, and Closure. Specifically, these devices include:- an inexpensive palpation probe to locate tumors (Chapter 3),- an <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tool</b> interface for surgical robotics (Chapter 5),- a fluid injector for surgical robotics (Chapter 4), and- a passive needle orientation texture (Chapter 6). Part III of this dissertation describes the design theory behind the author's work presented in Part 1 (examples) and Part 2 (case studies). In Chapter 7, a short history of design theory in the Bauhaus school of (1919 - 1933) is presented through examples taken from the author's work. Chapter 8 serves as a link to future efforts by the author by bridging the presented frugal design work into the global development effort of frugal innovation. The design theory material in Part 3 is presented for three reasons:First: Conceptual design depends on the practitioner's ability to abstract design criteria into diverse functional solutions. The author's practice in this area involves the artistic study of functionalist abstraction as unconstrained exploration of the design space. That practice is presented to elucidate the creative origins of the solutions presented herein, and to provoke creative problem solving in others. Second: A socially-progressive responsibility, inherent in the Bauhaus ideology, is modernized in Chapter 8 as Frugal Design, which borrows its motivation from a new trend indevelopment for emerging markets known as Frugal Innovation. Third: A parallel is drawn to the climate of artificially intelligent automation in present-day Bay Area research in Berkeley, Stanford, and Silicon Valley to the Bauhaus, which was founded as a reaction to increasing automation during the first machine age in Germany...|$|E

40|$|In the {{classical}} job shop scheduling problem (JSSP), n jobs are processed to completion on m unrelated machines. Each job requires processing on each machine exactly once. For each job, technology constraints specify a complete, distinct routing which is fixed and known in advance. Processing times are sequence-independent, fixed, and known in advance. Each machine is continuously available from time zero, and operations are processed without preemption. The {{objective is to}} minimize the maximum completion time (makespan). The flexible job shop (FJS) scheduling problem extends JSSP by assuming that, for each given operation, there exists at least one instance of the machine type necessary to perform it. We are thus confronted with two problems, that of assigning each operation to an appropriate machine, and that of sequencing the operations on each machine. The flexible-routing job shop (FRJS) scheduling problem, or job shop with multipurpose machines, extends JSSP by assuming that a machine may be capable of performing more than one type of operation. (For a given operation, there must exist at least one machine capable of performing it.) FRJS approximates a flexible manufacturing environment with numerically controlled work centers equipped with <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tool</b> magazines.

40|$|Study Objective: To {{highlight}} {{the first case}} of laparoscopic hysterectomy performed with percutaneous instruments (The Percuvance System, Teleflex Incorporated, Wayne, PA). Design: The basis {{of the system is}} a < 3 -mm diameter shaft that, when connected to an introducer tool tip, can be inserted percutaneously through the skin. The introducer tool tip can then be exchanged outside the body {{for a wide variety of}} 5 -mm interchangeable surgical tool tips. The shaft is sufficiently strong to hold structures, and surgeons can use its <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tool</b> tips to grasp, cut, and manipulate tissue. We used a 3 -dimensional high-definition 10 -mm flexible tip endoscope (ENDOEYE FLEX 3 D, Olympus Winter & IBE GMBH, Hamburg, Germany). Background: Minilaparoscopy is an attractive approach for hysterectomy due to advantages such as reduced morbidities and enhanced cosmesis. However, it has not been popularized because of the lack of suitable instruments and high technical demand. The Percuvance system represents a significant advance in minimally invasive surgery. Setting: Catholic University of the Sacred Hearth, Rome, Italy. Patient: A 53 -year-old, multiparous patient with endometrial endometroid cancer grade 1, Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique stage IA. The patient provided informed consent to use the images and video of the procedure. Institutional review board approval was not required. Intervention: The patient was hysteroscopically diagnosed with endometrial cancer after removal of an endometrial polyp adnexectomy. Once referred to our center, surgical staging was planned, including total hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy. Laparoscopy with 2 lateral percutaneous and 1 soprapubic 3 -mm instruments was believed to be feasible to achieve these procedures. Main Results: The operation was performed successfully with no intraoperative or postoperative complications. Operative time was 80 minutes overall, and blood loss was 50 mL. The pathology report confirmed endometrial endometroid cancer grading 1, Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique stage IA. The patient was discharged on day 1. After 2 months, no late complications or recurrence was detected. Conclusion: Percutaneous total hysterectomy is technically feasible, and the use of this novel device permits surgeons to mantain a standard setting. Further studies are mandatory to define the benefits, advantages, and costs of this novel approach with respect to other minimally invasive approaches...|$|E

40|$|Background: Clinical {{practice}} guidelines (CPG) {{have been}} shown to improve processes of care and clinical outcomes. The present study sought to determine how clinicians in Queensland public hospitals view and use such guidelines. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted of a convenience sample of medical practitioners, nurses and allied-health professionals in 19 public hospitals. Results: Of 333 surveyed clinicians, 216 returned questionnaires (65 % response rate). Of these, 67 % reported guideline use in their clinical area; more so in general than in tertiary hospitals (75 % vs. 60 %; P = 0. 03) or in district hospitals (75 % vs. 56 %; P = 0. 05). The guidelines were considered useful by 85 % of respondents; 45 % used them at least once a week. Lack of awareness of guidelines (45 %) or inability to access them when needed (44 %) prevented greater use. Concise, quickreference formats were preferred to detailed texts (35 % vs. 6 %; P < 0. 001). Sixty per cent of respondents became acquainted with guideline recommendations through informal discussions with colleagues rather than through organized awareness-raising (27 %) or educational forums (41 %; P < 0. 001). Guideline endorsement by senior colleagues (68 %) and peers (53 %) was considered essential to maximizing uptake. Barriers to implementing guideline recommendations were encountered by 62 % of clinicians, including insufficient clinical resources (29 %) or time (24 %), and conflict with accepted practice codes (19 %). Conclusions: In general, clinicians working in public hospitals use CPG and view them positively. Based on freetext comments, a minority of non-medical respondents perceived guidelines and pathways as <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tools.</b> Improved uptake is dependent on increasing access, enhancing user-friendly guideline presentation, deploying local opinion leaders, and mitigating environmental barriers to implementation.

40|$|PDE-based {{numerical}} simulation applications commonly use basic software infrastructure to manage mesh, geometry, and discretization data. The commonality of this infrastructure implies {{the software is}} theoretically amenable to re-use.

This {{is especially true for}} meshing and geometry libraries where applications often directly access the underlying data struc-tures, which can be quite different from implementation to implementation.

40|$|The key task in {{initiating}} the fabrication of mirror substrates {{for the new}} High NA Camera is in preparing the specification package that details the substrate geometry and the specifications for the optical surface. This specification package has been completed for substrate M 1, and the vendor has begun optical fabrication. In addition, mounting hardware has been designed and fabricated, and substrates have been bonded to the kinematic mounts. The design of the secondary substrate, M 2, is underway, but will depend upon details of the PO Box actuation system and space constraints. Sufficient details of the M 2 design to enable the vendor to procure material will be determined during October, while the final details of the mounting surfaces will be completed prior {{to the end of}} Q 4 1999. The geometry of the Ml substrate is compatible with our planned approach for fixturing the optic within the PO Box and within metrology tools. The completion of this specification package required detailed consideration of: the mounting approach within the PO Box, degrees of actuation required for PO Box alignment, space constraints imposed by the vendor's metrology, requirements for LLNL metrology, and datum definitions needed for mechanical assembly of the PO Box. In addition, each of the degrees of freedom of the substrate has been properly constrained, and shown to be sufficiently insensitive to disturbance forces for minimizing deformation. An approach to fixturing has been adopted that extends beyond the approach taken for the Engineering Test Stand (ETS). For the ETS, each substrate, including spares, has dedicated mounting hardware that is used exclusively for each element. In exchange for a reduced risk of mounting-induced deformation, this incurred substantial expense and precluded optics from using <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tooling.</b> For the current High NA camera, we have adopted an approach that employs interchangeable mounting hardware {{that can be used for}} any of the substrates. This approach better accommodates a large number of manufacturing spares and the need for different mounting hardware for the PO Box and the metrology tools. This approach was enabled by designing the mounting hardware to minimize differences in the disturbance forces offered by different fixtures on the optic. An error budget and sensitivity analysis indicates that figure errors induced on the optics due to changes in fixturing are within the required tolerances for high quality imaging. The specifications for the optical surface on Ml are nominally the same as for the ETS substrates. These impose requirements for 0. 25 nm rms for figure, 0. 20 nm rms for mid-spatial frequency roughness, and 0. 10 nm rms for high spatial frequency roughness. These designations are sufficient for controlling wavefront quality, image contrast, and multilayer reflectivity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With the {{development}} of new technologies in surgery, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has drastically improved the way conventional medical procedures are performed. However, a new learning curve has resulted requiring an expertise in integrating visual information with the kinematics and dynamics of the surgical tools. The Red DRAGON is a multi-modal simulator for teaching and training MIS procedures allowing one to use it with several modalities including: simulator (physical objects and virtual objects) and an animal model. The Red DRAGON system is based on a serial spherical mechanism in which all the rotation axes intersect at a single point (remote center) allowing the endoscopic tools to pivot around the MIS port. The system includes two mechanisms that incorporate two <b>interchangeable</b> MIS <b>tools.</b> Sensors are incorporated into the mechanism and the tools measure the positions and orientations of the surgical tools as well as forces and torques applied on the tools by the surgeon. The design is based on a mechanism optimization to maximize the manipulability of the mechanism in the MIS workspace. As part of a preliminary experimental protocol, five expert level surgeons performed three laparoscopic tasks – a subset of the Fundamental Laparoscopic Skill (FLS) set as a baseline for skill assessment protocols. The results provide an insight into the kinematics and dynamics of the endoscopic tools, as the underlying measures for objectively assessing MIS skills...|$|R

We evaluated retrospectively the surgical outcome {{of different types of}} surgery on eye muscles to correct the diplopia. Each operated muscle seems to have its own dose-effect response, e. g. the effect of 1 mm recession of the muscle on the correction of the eye position (strabismus). As soon as 3 months after surgery, the outcome is stable and if needed further treatment can be planned. We also studied if tools to measure different aspects of strabismus were <b>interchangeable,</b> especially the <b>tools</b> to evaluate outcome on ductions and cyclodeviation.

40|$|Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is {{a fairly}} recent {{surgical}} approach that {{eliminates the need for}} external incisions on the patient. NOTES takes the minimally invasive surgery paradigm a step further by using a natural orifice as the pathway to transport surgical tools to the surgical site and completely eliminating the need for even the smallest incision on the skin. Although the concept of NOTES has been in existence for the past decade, technological deficiencies prevent it from being widely accepted in human surgeries. A novel multifunctional robot for NOTES has been developed to overcome these limitations and make the approach a feasible one. The NOTES robot comprises a multifunctional robotic manipulator and a steerable and articulating drive mechanism. The robotic manipulator carries three <b>interchangeable</b> surgical <b>tool</b> tips in a cartridge that enables tool changing without removing the robot from the patient. A stereovision camera is attached {{at the tip of the}} robotic manipulator to provide real-time video feedback to the surgeon. A steerable articulating drive mechanism is connected to the robotic manipulator to guide the robot and navigate through a natural orifice. Besides its guiding capabilities, the drive mechanism is also shape-lockable which provides a stable platform for the robotic manipulator to perform surgeries. The design process and engineering analysis for the articulating drive mechanism are discussed in detail in this thesis. The first-generation drive mechanism is designed and built as a proof of concept. Bench-top tests show that the design achieves the purpose of guiding and positioning the robotic manipulator. It is believed that the articulating drive mechanism can provide freedom of movement to the robotic manipulator and help circumvent some of the difficulties faced by approaches such as typical minimally invasive surgery (MIS). The second generation of the articulating drive mechanism is presented next, whereby the overall size of the drive mechanism is reduced significantly and the components in part of the drive transmission are also altered. Phantom Omni joysticks from SensAble Technologies are used as control consoles for the drive mechanism. The programming for the drive mechanism controls has been developed and is presented in this thesis. Although further improvements are necessary to the current iteration of the robot, bench-top testing results show promise of continued success for the multifunctional robot for NOTES.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis was aimed at developing an in vitro cell-based reporter gene system applicable to the detection of the illegal use of androgenic growth promoters in cattle, {{and the presence of}} potential endocrine disrupters present in surface waters and interfering with androgenic action. The system is based on a luciferase reporter gene placed under transcriptional control of an authenticated androgen-responsive element (ARE) and an endogenously expressed androgen receptor. This system allows for the integration of the effects of certain modulators of androgenic signal transduction. A second important goal of the research was to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying enhanced growth promotion by mixtures of androgenic and estrogenic compounds. The use of such mixtures, which results in activation and subsequent interaction of multiple steroid receptors, is occasionally observed in illegal hormonal treatments of cattle. When applied to the screening of calf urine samples for anabolic androgens, the developed AR-LUX assay was able to identify androgen-treated animals with similar results as obtained by standard GC-MS analysis. However, both techniques should be regarded as complementary rather than <b>interchangeable</b> screening <b>tools.</b> Liquid samples confiscated at cattle farms outside the Netherlands were found to generate a very strong response in the AR-LUX assay despite the fact that GC-MS analysis did not detect the presence of any anabolic compounds. Possibly, the samples contained a mixture of conventional androgenic compounds, each at undetectably low amounts and/or (novel) unknown compounds not tested for by GC-MS. These results emphasize the additional value of the developed AR-LUX assay. Also, the AR-LUX assay was used to determine the androgenic activity of a number of aquatic environmental samples. A number of these samples were found to contain androgenic activity at varying concentrations. Interestingly, in 2 samples containing androgens, enhancing interactive mixture effects were observed, which were probably due to interactions by estrogenic compounds and estrogen receptor activation. Our research furthermore indicates that certain established progestagens are able to activate ARE-mediated luciferase expression via progesterone receptors; we hypothesise preferentially through the progesterone receptor-α isoform. This indicates that androgen reporter assays based on the activation of the androgen receptor alone rather than on activation of a response element might produce results quite different from those observed in assay systems featuring multiple steroid receptors. This further emphasizes the notion that the AR-LUX assay is not merely detecting activation of the androgen receptor by androgens, but also allows for the detection of other androgenic substances that regulate gene expression via alternative pathways leading to activation of an established androgen response element...|$|R
40|$|Objective The {{evolution}} of {{minimally invasive surgery}} has moved beyond reduction of surgical trauma while maintaining adequate efficacy and safety standards. Percuvance™ Percutaneous Surgical System (PSS) instruments represents the last novelty in this panorama. Consisting of less than 3 mm laparoscopic shaft introduced percutaneously with an <b>interchangeable</b> 5 mm <b>tool</b> installed {{in place of the}} needle tip, they combine micro-invasiveness and operative performance. Study design We prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed data of 10 cases of laparoscopic total hysterectomy with Percuvance™ PSS for benign or early malignant gynecological diseases in order to assess the capability and safety of this new device. Data were recorded in a prospectively designed clinical database including patient demographics characteristics, operative data, intra- and postoperative complications, conversion rate, length of hospital stay and cosmetic outcome. Results The reported series consisted of 10 patients undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy with a median age of 51. 5 years (range 44 - 72 years) and a median BMI (body mass index) of 25. 3 (range 19. 7 - 30. 4). All patients had bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy and two of them underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy. A median operative time of 67 min (range 45 - 180 min) and a median estimated blood loss (EBL) of 50 ml (range 10 - 100 ml) were registered. Median PSS introduction time was 5 min (range 3 - 10 min). No conversions to standard laparoscopy or laparotomy were required and no intraoperative complications occurred. Discharge was on day 1 in 4 cases, on day 2 in the other 6 cases. All patients conveyed complete satisfaction with the cosmetic result and postoperative pain control. No complications were registered within 30 days after surgery. Conclusions PSS total laparoscopic hysterectomy is safe and feasible with good results in terms of operative time, cosmesis, postoperative pain, recovery and short hospitalization. Further studies are needed to compare PSS total hysterectomy to conventional multi-access laparoscopic and other mini-invasive approaches...|$|R

In addition, a storage glovebox and a distillation glovebox (already developed) will be attached to the transport system. Two other gloveboxes, one accommodating two casting furnaces and another storage glovebox, will be installed in the laboratory independent of the transport system. A transfer system (trolley) will be incorporated to handle material flow between the pyrochemical furnace gloveboxes, the press glovebox, the storage glovebox, and the distillation glovebox. The trolley will be very simple to operate, able to accommodate at least 50 pounds, require minimal maintenance, and be able to be requested and operated fiom any of the glovebox locations on the line. The transfer system will be capable of discharging its load in some manner through the open door to the entrance of each of the gloveboxes on the line. This may be an automatic function with manual selection for unusual loads or a completely manual operation. An existing commercial or otherwise proven system will be used if possible to minimize the design and test time needed for the system. Two commercial systems examined so far are the Montrac monorail type system available from Montech Incorporated and the Linear Synchronous Motor system available from MagneMotion Inc. Work to be completed during FY 02 includes glovebox design, transport system industry research, demonstration of selected commercial transport systems, transport system conceptual design, metal breaking press conceptual design, and glovebox furnace lift mechanism design. Glovebox fabrication/procurement, material transport system procurement, press procurement, lift mechanism procurement, system assembly and staging, system testing, assistance in installing the system into TA- 55, assistance with NMT configuration management approvals, and shakeout testing of the system is scheduled for FY 03 and FY 04. The goal is to have a fully functioning and modernized pyrochemical processing line in PF- 4 ready for processing sometime in the first or second quarter of FY 04...|$|R
