2500|$|Finely ground {{bituminous}} coal, {{known in}} this application as sea coal, is a constituent of <b>foundry</b> <b>sand.</b> While the molten metal {{is in the}} mould, the coal burns slowly, releasing reducing gases at pressure, and so preventing the metal from penetrating the pores of the sand. It is also contained in 'mould wash', a paste or liquid with the same function applied to the mould before casting. Sea coal can be mixed with the clay lining (the [...] "bod") used for {{the bottom of a}} cupola furnace. When heated, the coal decomposes and the bod becomes slightly friable, easing the process of breaking open holes for tapping the molten metal.|$|E

40|$|The reuse of {{reclaimed}} green molding sands {{is considered}} {{in this work}} both for the cold-box cores production in a cast iron foundry {{and the production of}} colorless glass. The regeneration process was performed in a wet mechanical treatment plant, belonging to the Gruppo Minerali S. p. A. (Novara, Northern Italy), on 500 t of the spent green molding sands coming out from the Teksid S. p. A. cast iron foundry of Crescentino (Vercelli, Northern Italy). The recovered <b>foundry</b> <b>sands</b> were characterized by means of physical, chemical and mineralogical analyses, to compare the gathered values with the required parameters for cores production: the cold-box process was simulated on laboratory scale. Several melting tests, using different raw material mixtures, were performed to obtain colorless glass. The recycling of the reclaimed <b>foundry</b> <b>sands</b> allows the achievement of several goals: the reduction of the landfilled industrial wastes and the raw materials saving, the production of good quality products and the economic advantage. In fact in Italy the silica <b>sand</b> employed in <b>foundry</b> operations and in the glass industry has a cost about equal to 0. 05 €/kg, the landfilling cost of the spent <b>foundry</b> <b>sands</b> is of about 0. 10 €/kg, and the total cost of the here considered wet mechanical regeneration treatment is of about 0. 03 - 0. 04 €/kg.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out in order to verify whether Acoustic Emission (AE) techniques could give information on the grain fineness number of silica <b>foundry</b> <b>sands</b> characterised by different grain size arrangements. The sands used were obtained by mixing silica <b>foundry</b> <b>sands</b> with different grain sizes, resulting in different average grain size and fineness number. To achieve the goal, drop tests were carried out making the different sands to slip on a metallic slanted plane equipped with an AE sensor. The AE emission signals were recorded and their typical parameters were analysed. The AE response was very sensitive to the geometry of experimental set up and test procedures, being mainly affected by the sand falling height and quantity, {{as well as on the}} length of the slanted plane. Nevertheless, for a fixed experimental set up and test procedure, the AE energy was strongly correlated with the average grain size, exponentially decreasing with increasing sand fineness. Thanks to its features, this method seems to be promising as an in-process monitoring system, based on a quick evaluation of the grain size...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{feasibility}} of concrete production using different kinds of industrial wastes as “recycled aggregate”.

The worst mechanical and leaching behaviours were shown by concrete samples containing EAF fly ashes and sludge from industrial wastewater treatment.

40|$|In {{traditional}} {{technologies of}} casting moulds and core production {{on the basis}} of high-silica sands with binding agent addition, the reclamation consists mainly of a sand recovery and very seldom of a sand and bentonite recovery. Analysis of data from several countries indicates that from 600 to 1200 kg of fresh sand is used for 1 tonne of ferrous casting alloys. In Poland it is 1000 kg of sand for 1 tonne of castings [1]. Out of this amount approximately 20 % of fresh sand is used for core production and the remaining amount for rebounding moulding sands. Analysis of data from 20 largest Polish foundries, performed in 2004 [2] indicates that approximately 50 % of waste <b>foundry</b> <b>sands</b> is reclaimed while the rest is directed to dumping grounds. Taking into account all remaining foundries it can be estimated that approximately 250 - 350 000 tonnes of waste <b>foundry</b> <b>sands</b> are sent to dumping grounds annually. Important issue are costs of storage, which depend on the kind of wastes and on the ownership form of dump-sites (municipal dumpinggrounds, plant’s or own [belonging to the foundry]) as well as on their relation to the costs of purchasing fresh sands. Average charges for storage of moulding sands wastes on storage yards in Europe are within the range: 12. 5 to 61 Eu, which means from 85 % to above 400 % of purchasing costs of 1 tonne of fresh high-silica sand.
