The <b>inherent</b> <b>regulation</b> network is complex and involves an important number of different factors. Consequently, global understanding of this biological process needs elaborate experiments. However, these experiments may be difficult to realize because of the need to manipulate in space and in time gene expression and hormonal treatments. Hence, we first modelled and simulated the biological process using Hybrid Functional Petri Nets. This powerful formalism offers a number of useful features and flexibility. Curves obtained in silico by simulations are in agreement with those observed in vivo and in vitro. Our modelling approach led us to ask pertinent biological questions, from which new hypotheses for experimental testing have emerged...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes {{solutions}} for an IPT system to operate efficiently when large changes in coupling take place. To achieve high power-efficiency independent of coupling, we utilise <b>inherent</b> <b>regulation</b> properties of resonant converters to avoid losing soft switching for any coupling value, and present the optimal load to the IPT-link at the maximum energy-throughput coupling. A probability-based model is introduced {{to assess and}} optimise the IPT system by analysing coupling as a distribution in time, which depends on the dynamic behaviour of the wireless charging system. The proposed circuits are a Class D rectifier with a resistance compression network (RCN) in the receiving-end and a load-independent Class EF inverter in the transmitting-end. Experiments were performed at 6. 78 and 13. 56 MHz verifying high efficiency for dynamic coupling and variable load resistance. End-to-end efficiencies of up to 88 % are achieved at a coil separation larger than one coil-radius for a system capable of supplying 150 W to the load, and the energy-efficiency was measured at 80 % when performing a uniformly-distributed linear-misalignment of 0 - 12. 5 cm, corresponding to a receiver moving at constant velocity over a transmitter without power throughput control...|$|E
40|$|Glycolysis is a {{metabolic}} pathway comprising {{a sequence of}} biochemical key reactions to generate energy and precursors for numerous associated {{metabolic pathway}}s in mammalian cells. Obviously, there are several levels of control required for a cellular system of such importance. However, despite considerable efforts to investigate regulation of energy metabolism, the dynamics of glycolysis in mammalian cells remains rather unclear. Our group investigates the energy metabolism of adherently growing Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, which serve as host cells for influenza vaccine production. After inoculation, cells grow exponentially until they reach confluency and eventually enter a stationary phase before they are infected. To understand the dynamics of energy metabolism, pulse experiments in stationary growth phase are performed that alter the metabolite levels in glycolysis and citric acid cycle within seconds. Most likely this highly dynamic behaviour is based on enzyme-metabolite interactions, which allows to obtain insight in the <b>inherent</b> <b>regulation</b> of the biochemical reaction sequences. Based on a method recently developed for the quantification {{of most of the}} intracellular metabolites involved in these pathways, detailed experimental data is available for establishment and validation of mathematical models [1]. Therefore, data obtained in high temporal resolution experiments using MDCK cells are integrated into a mathematical model to investigate the inherent dynamics of glycolysis. The model comprises a set of differential equations and aims at identifying crucial regulatory mechanisms as well as elucidating the role of associated metabolic pathways. The approach focuses on the design of new experiments for a better understanding of energy and carbon metabolism of mammalian cells, and subsequently the identification of process parameters relevant for optimisation of vaccine production processes...|$|E

MethodsExplant disks of bovine calf cartilage were slowly compressed (unconfined) over 3 -min to their 1 mm cut-thickness (0 %-compression) or to 50 %-compression with or without 300 ng/ml IGF- 1. Expression of 24 genes involved in cartilage homeostasis was measured using qPCR at 2, 8, 24, 32, 48 h after compression ±IGF- 1. Clustering analysis was used to identify groups of co-expressed genes to further elucidate mechanistic pathways. ResultsIGF- 1 alone stimulated gene expression of aggrecan and collagen II, but simultaneous 24 h compression suppressed this effect. Compression alone up-regulated expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 3, MMP- 13, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif (ADAMTS) - 5 and transforming growth factor (TGF) -β, an effect not reversed by simultaneous IGF- 1 treatment. Temporal changes in expression following IGF- 1 treatment were generally slower than that following compression. Clustering analysis revealed five distinct groups within which the pairings, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) - 3 and ADAMTS- 5, MMP- 1 and IGF- 2, and IGF- 1 and Collagen II, were all robustly co-expressed, suggesting <b>inherent</b> <b>regulation</b> and feedback in chondrocyte gene expression.

40|$|Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs) {{have emerged}} as key enzymes in tumor cell biology. The {{importance}} of MT 1 -MMP, in particular, is highlighted by its ability to activate pro-MMP- 2 at the cell surface through {{the formation of a}} trimolecular complex comprised of MT 1 -MMP/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 2 (TIMP- 2) /pro-MMP- 2. TIMPs 1 - 4 are physiological MMP inhibitors with distinct roles in the regulation of pro-MMP- 2 processing. Here, we have shown that individual Timp deficiencies differentially affect MMP- 2 processing using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Timp- 3 deficiency accelerated pro-MMP- 2 activation in response to both cytochalasin D and concanavalin A. Exogenous TIMP- 2 and N-TIMP- 3 inhibited this activation, whereas TIMP- 3 containing matrix from wild-type MEFs did not rescue the enhanced MMP- 2 activation in Timp- 3 (-/-) cells. Increased processing of MMP- 2 did not arise from increased expression of MT 1 -MMP, MT 2 -MMP, or MT 3 -MMP or altered expression of TIMP- 2 and MMP- 2. To test whether increased MMP- 2 processing in Timp- 3 (-/-) MEFs is dependent on TIMP- 2, double deficient Timp- 2 (-/-) /- 3 (-/-) MEFs were used. In these double deficient cells, the cleavage of pro-MMP- 2 to its intermediate form was substantially increased, but the subsequent cleavage of intermediate-MMP- 2 to fully active form, although absent in Timp- 2 (-/-) MEFs, was detectable with combined Timp- 2 (-/-) /- 3 (-/-) deficiency. TIMP- 4 associates with MMP- 2 and MT 1 -MMP {{in a manner similar to}} TIMP- 3, but its deletion had no effect on pro-MMP- 2 processing.

40|$|Flowering {{is one of}} the {{important}} defining features of angiosperms. The initiation of flower development and the formation of different floral organs are the results of the interplays among numerous genes. But until now, just fewer genes have been found linked with flower development. And the functions of lots of genes of Arabidopsis thaliana are still unknown. Although, the quartet model successfully simplified the ABCDE model to elaborate the molecular mechanism by introducing protein-protein interactions (PPIs). We still don't know much about several important aspects of flower development. So we need to discriminate even more genes involving in the flower development. In this study, we identified seven differentially modules through integrating the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) method to analyze co-expression network and PPIs using the public floral and non-floral expression profiles data of Arabidopsis thaliana. Gene set enrichment analysis was used for the functional annotation of the related genes, and some of the hub genes were identified in each module. The potential floral organ morphogenesis genes of two significant modules were integrated with PPI information in order to detail the <b>inherent</b> <b>regulation</b> mechanisms. Finally, the functions of the floral patterning genes were elucidated by combining the PPI and evolutionary information. It was indicated that the sub-networks or complexes, rather than the genes, were the regulation unit of flower development. We found that the most possible potential new genes underlining the floral pattern formation in A. thaliana were FY, CBL 2, ZFN 3 and AT 1 G 77370; among them, FY, CBL 2 acted as an upstream regulator of AP 2; ZFN 3 activated the flower primordial determining gene AP 1 and AP 2 by HY 5 /HYH gene via photo induction possibly. And AT 1 G 77370 exhibited similar function in floral morphogenesis, same as ELF 3. It possibly formed a complex between RFC 3 and RPS 15 in cytoplasm, which regulated TSO 1 and CPSF 160 in the nucleus, to control the floral organ morphogenesis.

40|$|Myostatin is a {{negative}} regulator of muscle growth. Loss of myostatin function results in a dramatic phenotype in several species including cattle, mice, dogs and humans. Myostatin mutants exhibit wide-spread hypermuscularity and decreased fat accumulation. Though the phenotype of myostatin mutant animals is very striking, the question remains whether the loss of myostatin function fundamentally changes growth potential, metabolism, or <b>inherent</b> <b>regulation</b> in tissues, {{or if it is}} simply an effect independent of other factors. To that end, we sought to increase muscle growth even further in myostatin null mice through the use of the β-adrenergic agonist clenbuterol. The effects of clenbuterol treatment and the loss of myostatin function are quite similar and, in this study, were completely additive. Clenbuterol treatment increased muscle weights and protein accretion and reduced fat accumulation in both wild type and myostatin null mice. There was a significant interaction of genotype and clenbuterol treatment for gastrocnemius muscle weight, but the magnitude of the differences in weight gain between myostatin null and wild type was very small. We also aimed to alter fat accumulation and metabolism in myostatin null mice by feeding diets high in fat. Other research indicated that myostatin null mice were resistant to fat accumulation induced by high-fat feeding. In our study, fat accumulation was increased in both wild type and myostatin null mice fed high-fat diets, but the magnitude of the increase in myostatin null mice was less than that of wild type mice. This suggests that myostatin null mice are partially resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity. Markers of metabolic syndrome often induced by high-fat feeding in mice were also improved in myostatin null compared with wild type mice. Liver fat content, serum triglycerides and serum leptin levels were lower in high-fat fed myostatin null mice than similarly fed wild type mice. Glucose tolerance, however, was altered in both genotypes by high-fat feeding and did not show an improvement in myostatin null mice. Given the partial resistance to high-fat induced fat accumulation, we investigated expression of adaptive thermogenic genes and found that some genes were upregulated specifically in high-fat fed myostatin null mice. These changes, however, likely do no fully account for the resistance to fat gain in myostatin null mice. Overall, we conclude from these two studies that, while the loss of myostatin function does have a dramatic effect in increasing muscle growth and reducing fat deposition, it does not represent maximal muscle or minimal fat accumulation. Muscle and fat tissues do respond to both beta-adrenergic agonists and to increased dietary fat and calories...|$|E
40|$|We {{utilized}} {{the framework of}} mathematical modeling to gain insights into two distinct biological systems, the JAK/STAT 1 signal transduction pathway and the regulation of cell cycle decisions in neuroblastoma. !! The family of JAK/STAT signaling pathways {{plays a key role}} in immunity. In several tumors dysregulation of the JAK/STAT pathways is observed. To investigate the functionality of this signal transduction pathway and eventually understand basic building principles, we establish a databased mathematical model of the JAK/STAT 1 pathway by means of kinetic rate equations. We showed that pathway activation is coupled tightly to the receptor stimulus at the cost of signal strength. The nuclear signal is sustained by a combination of fast translocation rates and short nuclear residence times of activated STAT 1 protein molecules. Model simulations reveal that STAT 1 dimerization kinetics have a strong impact on both efficiency of signaling and response kinetics, implying that protein-protein interactions are evolutionary constrained to ensure network functionality. Measurements of STAT 1 transport mutants validated the mathematical model and showed that STAT 1 activation is robust against enhanced nuclear export. By the kinetic design of the pathway input noise is suppressed, the pathway can be efficiently activated and rapid relaxation after stimulus withdrawal is ensured. !! Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor of infants and children. Its course of illness varies between spontaneous regression and malignant, aggressive progression. Amplification of the MYCN oncogene is predictive for poor clinical outcome in neuroblastoma. MYCN-amplified cells proliferate strongly and exhibit impaired cell cycle arrest. To rationalize the impact of MYCN on the regulatory networks, governing cell cycle progression and DNA damage response, we established mathematical models of the regulatory modules, p 53 -MDM 2 and E 2 F 1 -pRB, by means of mass action kinetics. The <b>inherent</b> <b>regulation</b> in the p 53 -MDM 2 module leads to an universal form of the p 53 - MDM 2 steady state and can account for several qualitatively different behaviors upon p 53 activation. We show that it is plausible that the weak G 1 arrest in the MYCN- overexpressing cells is due to a MYCN-induced protein level imbalance in the p 53 - MDM 2 module. Furthermore we argue that the bifurcation diagram of the G 1 -S transition model can both theoretically as well as experimentally be used as an output to analyze the restriction point behavior in neuroblastoma. It shows that for cells with relatively high MYCN level and an enhanced CDK 4 signal the bistable region is shifted to low stimuli and the model stays in an activated state even under DNA damage. A mathematical framework is provided, which potentially can serve as a future standard method to extract underlying cell cycle parameters from combined FACS-measured cell cycle phase distributions and cell growth rate measurements. Analysis of measurements in the SH-EP neuroblastoma cell line showed that conditionally upregulated MYCN mainly changes the length of the G 1 phase...|$|E

With simulations using this model we sought to address the net effect of nTreg activation and its specific functions as well as identify mechanisms of the natural inflammatory response that are best targeted to inhibit viral spread without compromising initial antiviral activity. Simulation results provide multiple insights that are relevant to developing intervention strategies that seek to exploit natural immune processes: i) induction of the regulatory respons...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} and compares candidate zero dv/dt half-wave Class-E rectifier topologies for integration into multi-MHz inductive power transfer (IPT) systems. Furthermore, a hybrid Class-E topology comprising advantageous properties from all existing Class-E half-wave zero dv/dt rectifiers is analysed {{for the first}} time. From the analysis, it is shown that the hybrid Class-E rectifier provides an extra degree of design freedom which enables optimal IPT operation over {{a wider range of}} operating conditions. Furthermore, it is shown that by designing both the hybrid and the current driven rectifiers to operate below resonance provides a low deviation input reactance and <b>inherent</b> output voltage <b>regulation</b> with duty cycle allowing efficient IPT operation over wider dc load range than would otherwise be achieved. A set of case studies demonstrated the following performances: 1) For a constant dc load resistance, a receiving end efficiency of 95 % was achieved when utilising the hybrid rectifier, with a tolerance in required input resistance of 2. 4 % over the tested output power range (50 W to 200 W). 2) For a variable dc load in the range of 100 % to 10 %, the hybrid and current driven rectifiers presented an input reactance deviation less than 2 % of the impedance of the magnetising inductance of the inductive link respectively and receiving end efficiencies greater than 90 %. 3) For a constant current in the receiving coil, both the hybrid and the current driven rectifier achieve <b>inherent</b> output voltage <b>regulation</b> in the order of 3 % and 8 % of the nominal value respectively, for a variable dc load range from 100 % to 10 %...|$|R

40|$|Elements of <b>regulation</b> <b>inherent</b> in {{most social}} health {{insurance}} systems are a uniform package of benefits and uniform cost sharing. Both elements risk to burden the population with a welfare loss if preferences differ. This suggests introducing more contracted choice; however, {{it is widely}} believed that this would not benefit the aged. This study examines the relationship between age and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for additional options in Swiss social health insurance. Through discrete choice experiments (DCE), a marked diversity of preferences can be established. The findings suggest that while the aged do exhibit more status quo bias, they require less rather than more specific compensation for selected cutbacks considered, pointing to potential for contracts that induce self-rationing in return for lower premiums. willingness-to-pay, health insurance, age, rationing...|$|R
40|$|Persistent infections {{caused by}} {{pathogens}} such as hepatitis C virus are major human diseases with limited or suboptimal prophylactic and therapeutic options. Given {{the critical role}} of dendritic cell (DC) in inducing immune responses, DC vaccination is an attractive means to prevent and control the occurrence and persistence of the infections. However, DCs are built-in with <b>inherent</b> negative <b>regulation</b> mechanisms which attenuate their immune stimulatory activity and lead to their ineffectiveness in clinical application. In this study, we developed a super DC stimulant that consists of a modified, secretory Toll-like Receptor (TLR) - 5 ligand and an inhibitor of the negative regulator, suppressor of cytokine sinaling- 1 (SOCS 1). We found that expressing the super stimulant in DCs is drastically more potent and persistent than using the commonly used DC stimuli to enhance the level and duration of inflammatory cytokine production by both murine and human DCs. Moreover, the DCs expressing the super stimulant are more potent to provoke both cellular and humoral immune responses against hepatitis C virus (HCV) antigen in vivo. Thus, the strategy capable of triggering and sustaining proinflammatory status of DCs {{may be used to}} boost efficiency of DC vaccine in preventing and combating the persistent infection of HCV or other chronic viruses...|$|R

Maintaining proton {{exchange}} membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack operating temperature across transient current profiles presents a significant challenge for fuel cell vehicles. Liquid cooled systems require active control of coolant temperature and flow rate to match heat rejection to heat generation. Evaporative cooling is an alternative to conventional liquid cooling in automotive sized PEMFC stacks. In an evaporatively cooled system, liquid water is injected directly into the cathode flow channels where it evaporates, both cooling and humidifying the stack. This paper uses a validated simulation to explore the <b>inherent</b> temperature <b>regulation</b> abilities of an evaporatively cooled PEMFC stack {{across a range of}} current profiles and drive cycles. Results show that throughout the normal operating current range, stack temperature varies by less than± 2. 0 °C, this is comparable to liquid cooling but without the need for active temperature control. The introduction of variable operating pressure and cathode stoichiometry using proportional integral control, can further reduce temperature variation to± 1. 0 °C and± 1. 2 °C respectively for step increases in current demand. Variable operating pressure is also shown to improve warm up time and reduce heat loss at low operating loads...|$|R

My work aims to show how divine possession, through a subversion of ritual hierarchies both within the space of ritual and outside of it, counters the hegemony of empire. To do this, I look to how divine possession inhabits bodies previously consumed by colonial rule and nationalist ideology, contests spaces that exist {{on the margins of}} political control, and relies upon subversive religious practice that open up knowledge and power against the formations of the state...|$|R

This paper argues that there are two distinctive roles required for agents in the implementation of workplace policies. First, the agent must somehow help solve the public goods problem <b>inherent</b> in workplace <b>regulation.</b> Second, the agent must be able to reduce the marginal cost of exercising rights conferred to workers that are an important feature of most regulatory programs. This article examines these issues in regard to implementing workplace policies in the U. S. and analyzes the comparative effectiveness of different workplace agents- from labor unions to alternative dispute resolution systems- in fulfilling these roles. ...|$|R
