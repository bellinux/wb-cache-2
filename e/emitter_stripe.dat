The experimental values of storage and quasi storage times are in good agreement with the calculated ones, on the contrary the fall time is longer especially when the forward base current is large.

This paper investigates the {{influence}} of stripe emitter area (Ae) and fraction mole (x) concerning about noise figure performance (FN) at HBT SiGe. It takes the second generation of HBT SiGe IBM withAe; 0. 18 x 10 μm 2 developed as its model. When the alterations of Ae are from 0. 18 x 10 μm 2, 0. 12 x 10 μm 2 and 0. 09 x 10 μm 2, {{at the same time}} the fraction mole (x) is raised twice, it makes positive relation to RB and β parameter, butnegative relation to RC, fT, and fmax parameter. A model of HBT SiGe with x: 0. 1 and Ae: 0. 18 x 10 μm 2 produces 0. 57 dBof Fn minimum, the value is less than the other of which has 0. 64 dB for Ae: 0. 12 x 10 μm 2 and 0. 69 dB for Ae: 0. 09 x 10. Then if fraction mole(x) is reduced for 50 %, it causes nonlinear Fn raising which are 77 %, 79 % and 89 % from theprevious value. Noise figure (Fn) had a negative relationship with <b>emitter</b> <b>stripe</b> area (Ae), whereas the mole fraction (x) has a positive relationship; so the noise figure (Fn) can be made low by minimizing <b>emitter</b> <b>stripe</b> area (Ae) and raisethe mole fraction (x) ...|$|E

One way to achieve a stable phase relationship and global coupling of the emitters of such a stripe-array is off-axis feedback. In this work several off-axis external cavity designs are discussed.

40|$|The emitter {{ballasting}} resistor is used {{to equalize}} the current distribution between the <b>emitter</b> <b>stripes</b> in pou er transistor, but it will degrade the output power, power gain, and power added efficiency. Experimental result indicates that the current gain of uniform-base SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBT's) decreases {{with the increase of}} the temperature above temperature of 160 K, so the current distribution is equalized by itself to some extent. Therefore, the microwave pow er SiGe HBT's without emitter ballasting resistor were fabricated for the first time, and the continuous output power of 5 W and power added efficiency of 63 % were obtained under Class C operation at frequency of 900 MHz.

After damage the quantum dot devices show {{a reduction in the}} nearfield emission intensity across the width of the facet. Panchromatic cathodoluminescence of the active region shows a decrease in intensity and reveals dark, non-radiative spots which enlarge as pulse length increases. The areal density of the spots, also present in unprocessed material from similar structures, is of the order of 106 cm− 2, five orders of magnitude lower than the dot populations at 1011 cm− 2. Increasing pump current pulse length to 500 ns and beyond did not increase the dark spot size, which depended on the duration of the lasing action, but decreased the cathodoluminescence intensity of both the spots and background regions inside the <b>emitter</b> <b>stripe,</b> while reference regions outside the stripe remained unchanged.

The a-C:N films contain between 0. 6 and 21 at % nitrogen. All films have a low resistivity (< 0. 1 Omega cm) and a microhardness of about 15 GPa indicating a high content of sp(2) bonds.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the effects of p-n junction geometry on output characteristics, especially Voc and efficiency of high efficiency silicon solar cells. Test structures and fully contacted cells with limited junction area (LJA) are fabricated. With the assistance of simulation tools such as PC 1 D and Quokka, relationships between Jo, Voc, efficiency and emitter parameters including its area, spacing and perimeter are established. Reduced Jo can be achieved and hence lead to an enhanced Voc provided all recombination sources are minimised except from the emitter. Through characterisation of fabricated test structures and simulation, it is revealed that a well-calculated emitter spacing can help maintain a high level of Jsc comparable to that of a full area solar cell. Recombination losses from different parts of an LJA cell structure are separately quantified with Quokka models, enabling a breakdown of total Jo into various cell regions. It is demonstrated that in a thin silicon cell structure with well passivated surfaces, an increase of over 30 mV in Voc can be achieved by reducing the emitter area to 3 % of the total cell area. As a consequence, maximum efficiency begins to shift from full area emitter toward lower emitter fraction, and finally for a simulated LJA cell, over 25 % efficiency occurs at 3 % emitter area with closely spaced <b>stripe</b> <b>emitters</b> or high lifetime silicon substrates...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of bias-free InN-based THz emitters that exploit lateral photocurrents is studied by means of numerical simulations. We use a drift-diffusion model with adjusted carrier temperatures and mobilities. The applicability {{of this approach is}} demonstrated by a comparison with results from Monte-Carlo simulations. We consider a simple but robust lateral emitter concept using metal stripes with two different thicknesses with one of them being thin enough to be transparent for THz radiation. This arrangement can be easily multiplexed and the efficiency of this concept has already been demonstrated by experiment for GaAs substrates. In the present study, we consider InN, which is known to be an efficient photo-Dember emitter because of its superior transport properties. Our main focus is on the impact of the emitter design on the emission efficiency assuming different operation principles. Both the lateral photo-Dember (LPD) effect and built-in lateral field effects are considered. The appropriate choice of the metal stripe and window geometry as well as the impact of surface Fermi level pinning are investigated in detail, and design guidelines for efficient large area emitters using multiplexed structures are provided. We find that InN LPD emitters do not suffer from Fermi level pinning at the InN surface. The optimum emission efficiency is found for LPD emitter structures having 200 nm wide illumination windows and mask <b>stripes.</b> <b>Emitter</b> structures in which lateral electric fields are induced by the metal mask contacts can have a considerably higher efficiency than pure LPD emitters. In the best case, the THz emission of such structures is increased by one order of magnitude.
