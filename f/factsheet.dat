5|$|Polonium was {{administered}} to humans for experimental purposes from 1943 to 1947; it was injected into four hospitalised patients, and orally given to a fifth. Studies such as this were funded by the Manhattan Project and the AEC and conducted at the University of Rochester. The objective was to obtain data on human excretion of polonium to correlate with more extensive data from rats. Patients selected as subjects were chosen because experimenters wanted persons {{who had not been}} exposed to polonium either through work or accident. All subjects had incurable diseases. Excretion of polonium was followed, and an autopsy was conducted at that time on the deceased patient to determine which organs absorbed the polonium. Patients' ages ranged from 'early thirties' to 'early forties'. The experiments were described in Chapter 3 of Biological Studies with Polonium, Radium, and Plutonium, National Nuclear Energy Series, Volume VI-3, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1950. Not specified is the isotope under study, but at the time polonium-210 was the most readily available polonium isotope. The DoE <b>factsheet</b> submitted for this experiment reported no follow up on these subjects.|$|E

2500|$|On an {{international}} scale, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) have begun focusing on labour environments {{in developing nations}} with projects such as Healthy Cities. Many of these developing countries are stuck in {{a situation in which}} their relative lack of resources to invest in OSH leads to increased costs due to work-related illnesses and accidents. As a 2007 <b>Factsheet</b> from the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work states: [...] "Countries with less developed OSH systems spend a far higher percentage of GDP on work-related injury and illness – taking resources away from more productive activities... The ILO estimates that work-related illness and accidents cost up to 10% of GDP in Latin America, compared with just 2.6% to 3.8% in the EU." [...] There is continued use of asbestos, a notorious hazard, in some developing countries. So asbestos-related disease is, sadly, expected to continue to be a significant problem well into the future.|$|E

[...] In 1990 the United States Congress {{requested the}} National Cancer Institute {{to conduct a}} study of cancer mortality rates around nuclear plants and other facilities covering 1950 to 1984 focusing on the change after operation started of the respective facilities. [...] They concluded in no link. [...] In 2000 the University of Pittsburgh found no link to heightened cancer deaths in people living within 5 miles of plant {{at the time of}} the Three Mile Island accident. [...] The same year, the Illinois Public Health Department found no statistical abnormality of childhood cancers in counties with nuclear plants. [...] In 2001 the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering confirmed that radiation emissions were negligibly low at the Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant. [...] Also that year, the American Cancer Society investigated cancer clusters around nuclear plants and concluded no link to radiation noting that cancer clusters occur regularly due to unrelated reasons. [...] Again in 2001, the Florida Bureau of Environmental Epidemiology reviewed claims of increased cancer rates in counties with nuclear plants, however, using the same data as the claimants, they observed no abnormalities.|$|E
