5|$|Like most amines, {{dopamine}} is {{an organic}} base. As a base, {{it is generally}} protonated in acidic environments (in an acid-base reaction). The protonated form is highly water-soluble and relatively stable, but can become oxidized if exposed to oxygen or other oxidants. In basic environments, dopamine is not protonated. In this free base form, it is less water-soluble and also more highly reactive. Because of the increased stability and water-solubility of the protonated form, dopamine is supplied for chemical or pharmaceutical use as dopamine hydrochloride—that is, the hydrochloride salt that is created when dopamine is combined with hydrochloric acid. In <b>dry</b> <b>form,</b> dopamine hydrochloride is a fine colorless powder.|$|E

5000|$|Collodion process, mostly {{synonymous with}} the [...] "collodion wet plate process", {{requires}} the photographic material to be coated, sensitized, exposed and developed within the span of about fifteen minutes, necessitating a portable darkroom {{for use in the}} field. Collodion is normally used in its wet form, but can also be used in humid ("preserved") or <b>dry</b> <b>form,</b> at the cost of greatly increased exposure time. The latter made the <b>dry</b> <b>form</b> unsuitable for the usual portraiture work of most professional photographers of the 19th century.
