60|$|Not only {{do these}} great {{practical}} difficulties {{lie in the}} way of applying the <b>hybridisation</b> <b>test,</b> but even when this oracle can be questioned, its replies are sometimes as doubtful as those of Delphi. For example, cases are cited by Mr. Darwin, of plants which are more fertile with the pollen of another species than with their own; and there are others, such as certain Fuci, the male element of which will fertilise the ovule of a plant of distinct species, while the males of the latter species are ineffective with the females of the first. So that, in the last-named instance, a physiologist, who should cross the two species in one way, would decide that they were true species; while another, who should cross them in the reverse way, would, with equal justice, according to the rule, pronounce them to be mere races. Several plants, which there is great reason to believe are mere varieties, are almost sterile when crossed; while both animals and plants, which have always been regarded by naturalists as of distinct species, turn out, when the test is applied, to be perfectly fertile. Again, the sterility or fertility of crosses seems to bear no relation to the structural resemblances or differences of the members of any two groups.|$|E

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{study the}} value of non-isotopic in situ {{hybridisation}} (NISH) in detecting human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in female genital lesions positive for the virus by conventional histology but negative by filter DNA hybridisation. METHODS [...] Forty three cases, which showed the histological hallmarks of the HPV infection but produced negative results in filter dot blot <b>hybridisation</b> <b>tests</b> (Vira Pap and Vira Type kits), were identified {{in the course of}} an investigation of 304 vaginal, vulvar, and cervical samples from 267 patients. These cases were studied by NISH for the presence of HPV infection. RESULTS [...] In 28 (65 %) of the cases NISH gave a positive hybridisation signal. In 26 cases (96 %) the signal was diffuse, and in two (4 %) punctate or diffuse, representing episomal and episomal or integrated HPV DNA, respectively. In most cases only a few HPV positive cells were discernible. CONCLUSION [...] NISH is a more sensitive technique than dot blot hybridisation, detecting HPV infection in most cases which show histological HPV atypia but which remain negative in filter DNA hybridisation. Thus NISH is useful as an additional technique to verify the presence of HPV in lesions which remain negative in filter <b>hybridisation</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2) gene overexpression in breast cancer patients encountered in Hong Kong and the concordance of HER 2 findings from primary immunohistochemistry assays and confirmatory in-situ hybridisation assays. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Department of Clinical Oncology in a public hospital in Hong Kong. Patients: All patient referrals between July 2006 and June 2007 with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer (for prevalence evaluation), and all patients treated at our unit with confirmatory in-situ <b>hybridisation</b> <b>tests</b> performed within the study period (for concordance evaluation). Results: There were 272 consecutive breast cancer patients eligible for prevalence evaluation. The distribution for immunohistochemistry staining in 249 cases for scores 0, 1 +, 2 +, and 3 + were 99 (40 %), 40 (16 %), 58 (23 %), and 52 (21 %) respectively. In the remaining 23 patients, four and 19 breast cancers were unscored and reported by immunohistochemistry to be HER 2 -positive and -negative, respectively. The overall HER 2 overexpression rate (3 + or reported as positive) was 21 %. HER 2 overexpression was associated with grade 3 histology (P< 0. 001) and negative hormonal receptor status (P< 0. 001). However, it {{was not associated with}} age (P= 0. 525), T-classification (P= 0. 740), N-classification (P= 0. 691), nor group stages (P= 0. 433). Of the 37 patients with confirmatory in-situ <b>hybridisation</b> <b>tests</b> performed, 10 (71 %) of 14 with immunohistochemistry staining of 3 + and 1 (4 %) of 23 with immunohistochemistry staining of 2 + were found to have HER 2 gene amplification.

40|$|Olive (Olea europaea) is host of 13 {{different}} viruses but, it {{is possible}} that other viruses, which are either non mechanically transmissible or occur in low concentration in plant tissues, are present in nature. This likelihood is supported by the widespread occurrence of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) in plants negative to biological tests. As very little information is available on the geographical distribution of olive-infecting, investigations were conducted for gathering information on the prevalence and distribution of olive viruses in the Mediterranean basin based on the presence of double stranded RNA (dsRNA).

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{determine}} {{the sensitivity of}} commercially available diagnostic assays for Chlamydia trachomatis using a simple method. METHODS [...] Nine commercial assays and an "in-house" polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were evaluated using serial dilutions of a laboratory grown H serovar [...] four of them using a laboratory grown E serovar. Seven of the assays were further tested using dilutions of several cervical samples known to contain chlamydiae. RESULTS [...] The most sensitive assays were the MicroTrak direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test (Syva) and the PCR which detected C trachomatis at a 10 (- 8) dilution of the H serovar, while the two least sensitive, Clearview (Unipath) and TestPack (Abbott), were positive only at 10 (- 4) and 10 (- 3) dilutions, respectively. A range of enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and a nucleic acid <b>hybridisation</b> <b>test</b> were of intermediate sensitivity. The results with serovar E were consistent with these.

40|$|Background. Human caliciviruses {{represent}} a genetically and antigenetically {{diverse group of}} single-stranded RNA viruses associated with acute gastroenteritis in humans. In last two years the number of notified gastroenteric cases in Slovenia is increasing. From January till November 2002 already 574 calicivirus cases have been confirmed. Majority of cases were observed in preschool and school children but no cases were described in the aged-care facility. Methods. An outbreak of gastroenteritis in an aged-care facility occured. After onset of the outbreak an epidemiological questionnaire and inspection of local conditions were realized. Stool samples from home residents were analysed to find out bacteriological and/or viral aetiology. Direct electron microscopy and RT-PCR assay was performed to detect caliciviruses. Viral RNA was amplified using specific primers and PCR products were identified in <b>hybridisation</b> <b>test.</b> Results. The outbreak started suddenly on the second floor, where the attack rate was the highest. On the other floors the illness started later and the attack rate was lower. Sixty-one (40, 1 %) residents from 152 became ill and additionally 15 (22, 4 %) employees from 67.  The outbreak ended after ten days. Electron microscopy or/and RT-PCR revealed Norovirus members of family Caliciviridae in 9 of 10 stool specimens. As determined by RT-PCR and hybridisation assay viruses corresponded to genogroup II, genetic cluster 1 (closely related to the Hawaii virus) and genetic cluster 4 (closely related to the Lordsdale virus).

40|$|Background. Human caliciviruses {{represent}} a genetically and antigenically {{diverse group of}} single-stranded RNA viruses associated with acute gastroenteritis in humans. In last two years the number of notified gastroenteric cases in Slovenia is increasing. Samples were analysed by direct electron microscopy (EM). For increased sensitivity RT-PCR assay was performed. Using molecular methods {{for the detection of}} caliciviruses we tried to detect causative agent in outbreaks where no viruses were found by direct EM. Methods. After onset of outbreak an epidemiologic questionnaire was performed, hygienic testing, and determination of pathogenic bacteria. Latex agglutination for determination of rota- and adenoviruses 40 / 41 were performed. Additionally ELISA test for determination of astroviruses was used. Stool samples were examined by direct electron microscopy. RNA was isolated from 15 positive samples in which small roundstructured viruses (SRSVs) were observed. RNA was amplified by RT-PCR using specific primers and the obtained products were confirmed in <b>hybridisation</b> <b>test.</b> Results. 20 children from 97 and 2 adults form 20 became ill. Symptoms included diarrhoea, vomiting and fever lasting for 1 to 3 days. None of patients sought medical help neither were hospitalized. Obtained food samples were not contaminated. From five hygienic smears coagulase positive staphylococci were isolated. All stool samples tested for pathogenic bacteria were negative, as well as for rota- and adenoviruses. Electron microscopy revealed 15 stool samples containing SRSVs. 11 of them were positive for caliciviruses, corresponding to genogroup II (GG II), as determined by RT-PCR and hybridisation assay.

40|$|Abstract Background Enterobacter sakazakii is a {{foodborne}} pathogen {{that has}} been associated with sporadic cases and outbreaks causing meningitis, necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis especially in neonates. The current FDA detection method includes two enrichment steps, the subculturing of the second enrichment broth on a selective agar (VRBG), a further subculturing of selected grown colonies on TSA and the subsequent biochemical identification of yellow-pigmented colonies by API 20 E. However, there is a strong need for simplified methods for isolation and identification of E. sakazakii. In this study, two chromogenic media, which allow to indicate presumptive E. sakazakii colonies by the alpha glucosidase activity, as well as a newly developed 1, 6 -alpha-glucosidase based conventional PCR assay and a rRNA oligonucleotide probe based commercial test system for identification of presumptive E. sakazakii were evaluated on 98 target and non-target strains. The methods were compared with respect to specificity aspects. Results A total of 75 presumptive E. sakazakii and 23 non-target strains were analysed by using chromogenic media, alpha-glucosidase based PCR assay, and the VIT assay. For most presumptive E. sakazakii strains on the chromogenic media, the PCR and VIT assay confirmed the identification. However, for a number of presumptive E. sakazakii isolates from fruit powder, the alpha-glucosidase PCR and VIT assay did not correspond to the typical E. sakazakii colonies on DFI and ESIA. Further characterization by API 32 E identification, phylogenetic analysis of partial 16 S rRNA sequences and ribotyping strongly suggested, that these strains did not belong to the species E. sakazakii. The newly developed alpha-glucosidase based PCR assay as well as the commercially available VIT Enterobacter sakazakii identification test showed an excellent correlation with the 16 S rRNA data, and are thus well suited for identification of E. sakazakii. Conclusion The results indicate that presumptive colonies on ESIA and DFI media need further species identification. Both evaluated molecular methods, the alpha-glucosidase PCR and the 16 S RNA in situ <b>hybridisation</b> <b>test</b> (VIT), although based on completely different target regions and methodologies performed equally well in terms of specificity. </p...|$|E

40|$|Aims: The aims of {{this study}} were to 1) assess the {{incidence}} and prevalence of the 22 q 11 deletion syndrome(22 q 11 DS) in a defined population of western Sweden, 2) to evaluate the presenting phenotype and 3) to investigate the profile of cognitive and nervous system-related disabilities and the resulting handicap,taking into account physical, neurological and psychological aspects. Material and Methods: The incidence was studied in children born in the Western Götaland Region,where Göteborg is the main city, during the years 1991 - 2000. The prevalence was studied in children inthe region younger than 16 years {{at the end of the}} year 2000 (Paper I). The presenting phenotype wasevaluated in a consecutive series of 100 children and adolescents younger than 20 years with the 22 q 11 DSreferred from the whole of Sweden to the Queen Silvia Children s Hospital in Göteborg during the years 1993 - 2002 (Paper II). Photographs of 80 children were used to evaluate the pattern of characteristic facialfeatures (Paper III). In the first 33 patients older than three years, development, cognition, motor functionand the handicap level according to WHO (1980) were evaluated (Paper IV). All 113 patients included inthe study had 22 q 11 deletion confirmed by the fluorescence in situ <b>hybridisation</b> <b>test.</b> Results: The mean annual incidence in the whole region was 14. 1 per 100, 000 live births. During thefirst five years the incidence was higher, 18. 1 per 100, 000 live births for the whole region and 23. 4 per 100, 000 live births in Göteborg, where a multidisciplinary specialist team for the 22 q 11 DS is based. About 60 % had a heart defect and the median age at diagnosis was 0. 6 years compared with almost 7 years in those without a heart defect. The prevalence was 13. 2 per 100, 000 children below 16 years ofage in the whole region and 23. 3 per 100, 000 in Göteborg. The presenting phenotype was studied in 100 consecutive children. Twenty-six were diagnosed during infancy and 92 % of them had a congenitalheart defect, whereas 54 % of those diagnosed later had a cardiac defect. The median age at diagnosis was 6. 7 years. The typical presentation in those diagnosed early consisted of an association of conotruncalheart defect, hypocalcaemia and hypoplasia of thymus, whereas those diagnosed later most often presentedwith the association of speech-language impairment, developmental delay or learning difficulties andrecurrent infections. A characteristic pattern of mild facial features was noted in children at all ages. Ahigh prevalence of cognitive and other neurologically related impairments was found. Hypotonia, coordinationdisturbance and poor balance were found in most patients. Around two-thirds had definitemotor problems, including two with spastic hemiplegia. Deviant pre-walking locomotion and delayedindependent walking and delayed achievement of bladder control were also common findings. Most hadan IQ below 85, and an IQ below 70 was found in one-third of the children. Performance IQ was moreimpaired than Verbal IQ. As a consequence of these and other associated problems, the resulting handicapwas considerable. Conclusion: The 22 q 11 deletion syndrome is a common genetic disorder. In spite of variable clinicalexpression, children with the disorder share a number of major features and have a characteristicphenotype. A high proportion has no cardiac defect and hence a diagnostic delay. Increased awareness andknowledge among specialists who meet these children early in life is needed to reduce the diagnostic delay. The comprehensive management of a child with the 22 q 11 DS is challenging because of the wide spectrumand variable expression of impairments and disabilities which, taken together, manifest as a considerablehandicap. A multi-professional approach and an individualised assessment are necessary to give the childadequate treatment and support...|$|E

A total of 25 wild and cultivated tomato and nine sweet-pepper genotypes obtained from the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Centre, Taiwan and local cultivars were screened at the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore, India, both by whitefly-mediated inoculation of virus in the glasshouse and natural infection in the field. Resistance to virus was assessed by disease incidence, symptom severity and DNA <b>hybridisation</b> <b>tests.</b> Resistance to B. tabaci was measured by counting the number of eggs, nymphs and pupal cases on the tomato genotypes. The wild species Lycopersicon peruvianum INRA sel. and L. chilense LA 1969 were resistant to ToLCBV-[Ban 4] but highly susceptible to whiteflies, whereas L. hirsutum LA 1777 was resistant to both the virus and the vector. Among the L. esculentum genotypes, H- 24, FL 744 - 6 - 9, FL 699 and FL 699 sp + were tolerant to ToLCBV-[Ban 4], but were susceptible to whiteflies.

Nucleosomal core particle consists of about 1. 45 base pairs (bp) of DNA and a hi stone octamer containing two molecules each of histones H 2 A, H 2 B, HI and H 4. Thf? data on the transcribed chromatin structure are very controversial (reviewed in 5, 6). It is generally accepted that increasing transcriptional activity caus» 3 progressive unfold-ing of chromatin structure (7). Thus, the removal of histane HI and then the core histones from moderately to actively transcribed ribosomal (8) and heat-shock Drosophila genes (9), which histones can be displaced by RNA polymerase (10, but see Ref. 58) seems to induce unfolding of the 30 nm fiber to the 10 nm-fiber and then to linearized DNA.

40|$|Faecal {{contamination}} of water sources {{can only be}} managed if the sources of pollution are identified and thus tools to distinguish between human and animal faecal sources are needed. Male-specific F-RNA coliphages have been classified into four sero-groups and evidence has been presented that two of these sero-groups are specific for human excreta {{and the other two}} for animal excreta. The sero-groups are readily detectable as genotypes with the application of molecular techniques, notable <b>hybridisation</b> <b>tests</b> using gene probes specific for each genotype. A standard ISO method was used for the detection of F-RNA coliphages. Wastewater containing predominantly animal excreta was collected from cattle, pig and chicken feedlots. Wastewater containing predominantly human excreta was collected from hospitals. The F-RNA genotyping study was qualitative and focussed on determining which groups of F-RNA phages were present in different wastewater and environmental samples. The results were in agreement with earlier reports on the specificity of F-RNA phage Genotypes 1 and 4 for animal wastes, and Genotypes 2 and 3 for human excreta. Besides being detected in human wastewater, F-RNA Group 3 was detected in both chicken and pig wastewater indicating that this Group was not specific to humans. The results showed that F-RNA phage Group 2 was the only group detected in seven of the twenty-six positive samples from the Dorpspruit, Slangspruit and uMsunduze Rivers, suggesting human faecal input. All other river water samples contained mixtures of F-RNA phage groups suggesting that the faecal input could not exclusively be ascribed to humans or animal sources alone. This suggested that both human and animal sources were responsible for {{contamination of}} receiving water at these sampling sites. The research proved that the genotyping of F-RNA phages was feasible in practice and could be used to assist in identifying the source of faecal pollution.

The recommendations for testing are the use of immunohistochemistry but with analysis of equivocal cases by in situ hybridisation to clarify their HER 2 status or the use of frontline fluorescence in situ <b>hybridisation</b> (FISH) <b>testing</b> for those laboratories wishing to do so; the inclusion of a chromosome 17 probe is strongly recommended.

40|$|An {{optically}} stable, novel {{class of}} fluorophores (quantum dots) for in situ <b>hybridisation</b> analysis was <b>tested</b> to investigate their signal stability and intensity in plant chromosome analyses. Detection of hybridisation sites in situ {{was based on}} fluorescence from streptavidin-linked inorganic crystals of cadmium selenide. Comparison of quantum dots (QDs) with conventional detection systems (Alexa 488) in immunolabeling experiments demonstrated greater sensitivity than the conventional system. In contrast, detection of QDs in in situ hybridisation of several plant chromosomes, using several high-copy sequences, was less sensitve than Alexa 488.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years two factors have helped to {{significantly}} advance our understanding of the Myxozoa. First, the phenomenal increase in fin fish aquaculture in the 1990 s has lead to the increased importance of these parasites; in rum this has lead to intensified research efforts, which have increased knowledge of the development, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of myxozoans. The hallmark discovery in the 1980 s that the life cycle of Myxobolus cerebralis requires development of an actinosporean stage in the Oligochaete. Tubifex tubifex, led to the elucidation of the life cycles of several other myxozoans. Also, the life cycle and taxonomy of the enigmatic PKX myxozoan has been resolved: it is the alternate stage of the unusual myxozoan. Tetracapsula bryosalmonae, from bryozoans. The 18 S rDNA gene of many species has been sequenced, and here we add 22 new sequences to the data set. Phylogenetic analyses using all these sequences indicate that: 1) the Myxozoa are closely related to Cnidaria (also supported by morphological data), 2) marine taxa at the genus level branch separately from genera that usually infect freshwater fishes; 3) taxa cluster more by development and tissue location than by spore morphology; 4) the tetracapsulids branched off early in myxozoan evolution, perhaps reflected by their having bryozoan. rather than annelid hosts; 5) the morphology of actinosporeans offers little information for determining their myxosporean counterparts (assuming that they exist), and 6) the marine actinosporeans from Australia appear to form a clade within the platysporinid myxosporeans. Ribosomal DNA sequences have also enabled development of diagnostic tests for myxozoans. PCR and in situ <b>hybridisation</b> <b>tests</b> based on rDNA sequences have been developed for Myxobolus cerebralis. Ceratomyxa shasta. Kudoa spp,, and Tetracapsula bryosalmonae (PKX). Lectin-based and antibody tests have also been developed for certain myxozoans, such as PKX and C. shasta. We also review important diseases caused by myxozoans. which are emerging or re-emerging. Epizootics of whirling disease in wild rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) have recently been reported throughout the Rocky Mountain states of the USA. With a dramatic increase in aquaculture of fishes using marine netpens, several marine myxozoans have been recognized or elevated in status as pathological agents. Kudoa thyrsites infections have caused severe post-harvest myoliquefaction in pen-reared Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and Ceratomyxa spp., Sphaerospora spp., and Myxidium leei cause disease in pen-reared sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and sea bream species (family Sparidae) in Mediterranean countries...|$|R

The expression of thrombomodulin and endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule- 1 provides evidence for the vascular origin of KS...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: No {{explanation}} for {{moderate to severe}} mental retardation is apparent in about 40 % of cases. Although small chromosomal rearrangements may account for some undiagnosed cases, a lack of genome-wide screening methods has {{made it impossible to}} ascertain the frequency of such abnormalities. METHODS: A fluorescence in-situ <b>hybridisation</b> (FISH) <b>test</b> was used to examine the integrity of chromosome ends in 284 children with unexplained moderate to severe retardation, and in 182 children with unexplained mild retardation. 75 normal men were also tested. When a chromosomal rearrangement was found, its size was estimated, and members of the child's family were investigated. FINDINGS: Subtle chromosomal abnormalities occurred with a frequency of 7. 4 % in the children with moderate to severe mental retardation, and of 0. 5 % in the children with mild retardation. The abnormalities had an estimated population prevalence of 2. 1 per 10, 000, and were familial in almost half of cases. INTERPRETATION: Once recognisable syndromes have been excluded, abnormalities that include the ends of chromosomes are the commonest cause of mental retardation in children with undiagnosed moderate to severe mental retardation. Owing to the high prevalence of familial cases, screening for subtle chromosomal rearrangements is warranted in children with unexplained moderate to severe mental retardation...|$|R
40|$|Appropriate and {{accurate}} determination of HER 2 status {{in women with}} breast cancer is critical for stratifying anti-HER 2 therapies, and for access to subsidised treatment in the Australian setting. We conducted a regulated, nationwide program providing HER 2 in situ <b>hybridisation</b> (ISH) <b>testing</b> for patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Cases with equivocal or non-diagnostic ISH test results at the local laboratory were sent to a high volume central testing laboratory for analysis using fluorescence ISH (FISH). We tested 78, 408 early breast cancers and 3469 metastatic cancers using ISH. Of these, 12, 405 early breast cancers (15. 8 %) and 798 metastatic cancers (23. 0 %) were HER 2 positive. During the testing period, the proportion of core biopsy samples increased, the number of repeat tests remained stable and testing turnaround time declined. Discordant 3 + IHC, ISH negative results dropped from 20 % to 13 % in early breast cancers and from 35 % to 8 % among metastatic breast cancers. Following central laboratory FISH testing only 87 samples remained non-diagnostic (1. 9 % of FISH-tested samples, 0. 1 % of the whole cohort), most being decalcified specimens. This is a successful story of a cohesive service determining HER 2 status in women with breast cancer in a ‘real-world’ setting...|$|R
40|$|The cytopathologic {{examination}} of urine and bladder washings {{is a simple}} method {{for the detection of}} primary bladder cancer in symptomatic patients or in patients with hematuria. This method is very useful for follow-up of patients after treatment in order to detect recurren ce ofbladder cancer, which occurs in a significant percentage of patients. Cytopathologic examination is very reliable for the diagnosis of high grade urothelial carcinoma, but it is less useful for the detection oflow grade urothelial neoplasms. Cells with obvious morphological signs of malignancy can be reliably recognised as such also in the case of intraepithelial urothelial carcinoma. However, as isolated malignant cells are involved, they cannot be reliably assessed concerning their invasive potential. The pro per handling and transport of urine or bladder washings, as well as standardised proceduresin the cytopathology laboratory, are very important to achieve the best possible results of cytopathologic examination. In the last decade, several new methods have also emerged in attempt to improve the cytopathologic{{examination of}} bladder cancer in doubtful cases. Among these, the Uro Vysion test is the most promising one. By using the method of fluorescent in situ <b>hybridisation,</b> this <b>test</b> can detect several cytogenetic changes characteristic of bladder cancer of various grades...|$|R
40|$|Learned vocal signals {{could be}} {{important}} {{in the formation of}} prezygotic isolation between two hybridising taxa. This study examined whether vocal variation in the parrot Platycercus elegans facilitates the separation of individuals from two subspecies, P. e. elegans (CR) and P. e. flaveolus (YR). CR and YR have very different plumage coloration, respectively deep crimson and pale yellow, but hybridise where they meet creating an intermediate population (WS). In a factorial design playback experiment, we conducted 108 playback trials on three focal populations (YR, WS, CR), in and around this area of <b>hybridisation,</b> to <b>test</b> if they respond differently to contact calls from their own or another population. We also analysed whether differences in acoustic variables of the stimulus calls predicted the response to the call. We did not find any indication that individuals from the three focal populations responded differently to calls sampled from their own or another subspecies. We did find an effect of two of the five acoustic variables that we used to describe and classify contact calls from the three source populations. Specifically, duration of the stimulus call positively affected the response from individuals from WS and negatively the response from CR, and CR responded more to stimulus calls with a lower peak frequency. Overall, we found no indication that acoustic variation in contact calls on a subspecies level is involved in maintaining plumage colour differences between P. e. elegans and P. e. flaveolus subspecies...|$|R
