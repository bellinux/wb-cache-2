5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} <b>flushes,</b> which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea <b>flushes</b> are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea <b>flushes</b> and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial <b>flushes</b> reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{velocity}} of dripline <b>flushing</b> in subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) systems affects system design, cost, management, performance, and longevity. A 30 ‐day field {{study was conducted}} at Kansas State University to analyze the effect of four targeted <b>flushing</b> velocities (0. 23, 0. 30, 0. 46, and 0. 61 m/s) for a fixed 15 min duration of <b>flushing</b> and three <b>flushing</b> frequencies (no <b>flushing</b> or <b>flushing</b> every 15 or 30 days) on SDI emitter discharge and sediments within the dripline and removed in the <b>flushing</b> water. At {{the end of the}} field experiment (371 h), the amount of solids carried away by the <b>flushing</b> water and retained in every lateral were determined as well as laboratory determination of emitter discharge for every single emitter within each dripline. Greater dripline <b>flushing</b> velocities, which also resulted in greater <b>flushing</b> volumes, tended to result in greater amounts of solids in the <b>flushing</b> water, but the differences were not always statistically significant. Neither the frequency of <b>flushing</b> nor the interaction of <b>flushing</b> frequency and velocity significantly affected the amount of solids in the <b>flushing</b> water. There was a greater concentration of solids in the beginning one‐third of the 90 m laterals, particularly for treatments with no <b>flushing</b> or with slower dripline <b>flushing</b> velocities.

40|$|Globally {{there are}} about 50, 000 large dams and among them 25, 500 are the storage {{reservoirs}} with storage volume of about 6, 464 Bm 3. Worldâ€™s annual reservoir storage loss in different regions due to sedimentation varies between 0. 08 - 2. 3 %, {{with an average of}} about 0. 6 %. It is estimated that in 2030 the demand of water would be 8500 Bm 3, but the existing storage would be around 7000 Bm 3. To meet 1500 Bm 3 shortfall, about 8100 reservoirs are needed and construction of so many reservoirs in future seems to be difficult. The only solution is to conserve the existing reservoirs by enhancing their lives by adopting appropriate measures. Various methods employed globally to conserve storage capacities of reservoirs arewatershed management, conventional dredging, dry excavation, hydrosuction, sediment routing/sluicing, sediment bypassing, density current venting, and sediment <b>flushing</b> through the reservoir, used independently or in combination. Present study focuses on the <b>flushing</b> operation to enhance the lives of reservoirs and toanswer several questions related to <b>flushing</b> operation, like, is reservoir flushable?, if yes, then what would be the <b>flushing</b> efficiency?, how many times in a year it should be <b>flushed?,</b> when it should be <b>flushed?,</b> how much would be the <b>flushing</b> discharge required?, how much should be the duration of <b>flushing?,</b> how much water would be sacrificed for the <b>flushing</b> operation?, and what would be the recovery in capacity of the reservoir considering the <b>flushing</b> operation?, etc. <b>Flushing</b> is a method by which the flow velocities in a Reservoir are increased to such alevel that deposited sediments are mobilized and transported through low level outlets in the dam. <b>Flushing</b> sediments through reservoirs has been practiced successfully and found to be inexpensive in many cases, however, a significant amount of water is required during <b>flushing</b> operation. Hence, there is need to numerically model the <b>flushing</b> scenarios to check the performances of reservoirs in restoring the reservoir capacities. <b>Flushing</b> probably has been implemented on many hundreds reservoirs of the world, but in literature only about 50 reservoirs are documented as <b>flushed,</b> and <b>flushing</b> data is available for only 25 reservoirs. Among them in literature about 6 reservoirs had been reported as successfully <b>flushed</b> i. e. Baira-India, Gebidem-Switzerland, Gmund-Austria, Hengshan-China, Palagnedra-Switzerland, and Santo-Domingo-Venezuela reservoirs. Various <b>flushing</b> indicators used to assess the feasibility of sediment <b>flushing</b> from reservoirs are Sediment Balance Ratio-SBR, Long Term Capacity Ratio-LTCR, Drawdown Ratio-DDR, Sediment Balance Ratio during full drawdown-SBRd, <b>Flushing</b> Width Ratio-FWR and Top Width Ratio-TWR. The usually adopted critical values of these indicators are: SBR > 1, LTCR approaching to unity, DDR > 0. 7, SBRd > 1, FWR > 1 and TWR = 1 - 2. In the present study, the values of these six <b>flushing</b> indicators were computed for the selected 14 <b>flushed</b> reservoirs of various regions of the world and were compared with their critical values. Out of 14 selected reservoirs, 6 were successfully <b>flushed</b> and 08 were partially <b>flushed.</b> From the analysis it was found that for successfully <b>flushed</b> reservoirs critical values of all six <b>flushing</b> indicators were satisfied, but for the partially <b>flushed</b> reservoirs critical values were also satisfied except for the <b>Flushing</b> Indicator LTCR. It shows the significance of LTCR over the other <b>Flushing</b> Indicators. So it was learnt that LTCR is the most important <b>flushing</b> indicator among the six indicators to assess the feasibility of sediment <b>flushing</b> through the reservoirs. Analysis results of the 14 reservoirs also show that among the successfully flushedreservoirs maximum value of LTCR is 1 for Santo-Domingo and Palagnedra Reservoirs, whereas, Hengshan Reservoir has the least value of LTCR, i. e., 0. 77, which is a successfully <b>flushed</b> reservoir, hence it was concluded that the critical value of LTCR may be taken as 0. 77 instead of 1 for the successfully <b>flushed</b> reservoirs. Equations were developed for SBR and LTCR by Multiple Non-linear Regression Analysis, using the data of six successfully <b>flushed</b> reservoirs. These equations were tested on foreign and Pakistani reservoirs and the comparison revealed that developed equations results match well with the results of Atkinson equations. To get confidence in numerically simulating the <b>flushing</b> scenarios, <b>flushing</b> operations were modeled for three successfully <b>flushed</b> reservoirs for which data of entire <b>flushing</b> activities were available to calibrate and validate the <b>Flushing</b> Models. To numerically simulate <b>flushing</b> operations, initially these three reservoirs were modeled for the sediment deposition processes. These reservoirs are Baira of India, Gebidem of Switzerland and Gmund of Austria. <b>Flushing</b> processes have been modeled using three Models, i. e. SHARC, HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0, and Tsinghua University Equation. Results of the study show that SHARC Model well simulates the sediment deposition processes, but it underestimates the <b>flushing</b> durations. Results of the HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0 Model show that it can well simulate sediment depositions and sediment <b>flushing</b> operations. Then Tsinghua University Equation was used for simulating the sediment <b>flushing</b> operations through these three reservoirs. Results of the Tsinghua University Equation reveal that Model well simulates sediment <b>flushing</b> operations through these reservoirs. All small reservoirs of Punjab Small Dams Organization (SDO) of Pakistan were investigated, and 20 reservoirs were selected based on detailed data availability to assess their feasibility for sediment <b>flushing.</b> The results reveal that based on the computed <b>Flushing</b> Indicators, 5 reservoirs can be ranked as likely to be successfully <b>flushed,</b> these are Jammargal, Phalina, Dharabi, Talikna, and Jabbi reservoirs. Among the five likely to be successfully <b>flushed</b> reservoirs, Jabbi reservoir having 3. 8 Mm 3 storage capacity was selected for modeling the sediment deposition and <b>flushing</b> processes. Jabbi Reservoir was created after the construction of Dam across Jabbi Nullah by the end of year 1990. Hydrographic survey of the reservoir was conducted after 10 years of operation in 2000, which was used for the validation of the sediment deposition process in the reservoir. The survey results show that sediment deposition in 10 years was about 0. 418 Mm 3. As results of the <b>flushing</b> modeling on the three foreign reservoirs proved that HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0 and Tsinghua University Equation well simulate the <b>flushing</b> processes, hence <b>flushing</b> operations of Jabbi Reservoir were modeled using two Models i. e. HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0 and Tsinghua University Equation, under two scenarios, i. e. <b>flushing</b> after one year and ten years of sediment deposition. Results of the both the Models and both the options for sediment deposition show good agreement with the observed deposited sediments. A complete <b>flushing</b> operation includes the emptying of reservoir, <b>flushing</b> the sediment through the reservoir and refilling of the reservoir. Considering the results of complete <b>flushing</b> operation it was estimated that refilling time required for the reservoir is about 64 % of the year as inflows to the reservoir are intermittent, hence annual <b>flushing</b> of the reservoir looks infeasible, however, large quantity of water for the <b>flushing</b> operation of the reservoir may be sacrificed after 10 years. HEC-RAS 4. 1. 0 and Tsinghua University Model Results were used to formulate the complete strategy for <b>flushing</b> the reservoir. Model results revealed that for <b>flushing</b> the Jabbi Reservoir after 10 years deposition, appropriate <b>flushing</b> months are July and August; suitable <b>flushing</b> discharge is 3 cumecs; time required to empty the reservoir is 0. 34 day; time required to refill the reservoir is 235 days; <b>flushing</b> duration required to <b>flush</b> 10 years deposited sediments is about 4 days; average flushable sediment diameter is 10 mm; and water required for <b>flushing</b> the reservoir would be about 4. 4 Mm 3. Following the knowledge earned from this research work, similar procedures can be applied to other reservoirs of the world to check the degree of success in <b>flushing</b> operation, moreover, <b>flushing</b> plans / strategies can be formulated and relevant recovery in the reservoir capacities can be assessed...|$|R
