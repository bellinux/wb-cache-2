25|$|<b>I</b> <b>approach</b> the {{presentation}} of Kierkegaard with some trepidation. Next to Nietzsche, or rather, prior to Nietzsche, I consider {{him to be the}} most important thinker of our post-Kantian age. With Goethe and Hegel, an epoch had reached its conclusion, and our prevalent way of thinking – that is, the positivistic, natural-scientific one – cannot really be considered as philosophy.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, though it's fetishistic and personal, I {{like to think}} that my fetishes aren't that obscure. Who doesn't want to see girls running down the {{trenches}} of World War One wreaking havoc? I'd always had an interest in those worlds comic books, fantasy art, animated films. I'd like to see this, that's how <b>I</b> <b>approach</b> everything, and then keep pushing it from there.|$|E
500|$|Marsh {{thought the}} problem with the album's {{narrative}} is that there isn't enough transitional material provided by the lyrics. There are no stage directions, no cast, and narration is restricted to key phrases (such as [...] "Tommy can you hear me?") Key problems included an unclear explanation of what Tommy didn't hear or see in [...] "1921", how or why he plays pinball, why [...] "Smash the Mirror" [...] leads into [...] "I overwhelm as <b>I</b> <b>approach</b> you" [...] (the opening line in [...] "Sensation"), why Tommy tells his followers in [...] "We're Not Gonna Take It" [...] they cannot drink or smoke but can play pinball, and what the [...] "you" [...] is in [...] "Listening to you, I get the music".|$|E

500|$|Monáe {{has said}} about the {{recording}} sessions [...] "Over {{the last year and}} a half when we were recording the ArchAndroid I went through a very transformative period in my life". Monáe completed the album in Atlanta at the Wondaland Studios and the famous asylum The Palace of the Dogs. Monáe has stated that the album signifies [...] "breaking the chains that enslave minorities of all types". She has said of recording the album, [...] "Overall, this music came from various corners of the world—from Turkey to Prague to Atlanta—places we were on tour. While recording, we’d experiment with different sounds. Once we became engulfed in the sound, we all had an emotional connection to the album. It has definitely transformed my way of thinking, the way that <b>I</b> <b>approach</b> the stage and overall, my life".|$|E

The daughter of an Anglican priest, the Reverend Hubert Brasier, May has said that her Christian faith [...] "is part of me.

2500|$|On October 11, 2002, Hagel, {{along with}} 76 other Senators, {{voted in favor}} of the Iraq Resolution. Hagel, a later critic of the war, commented on his vote authorizing {{the use of force against}} Iraq saying, [...] "How many of us really know and {{understand}} much about Iraq, the country, the history, the people, the role in the Arab world? <b>I</b> <b>approach</b> the issue of post-Saddam Iraq and the future of democracy and stability in the Middle East with more caution, realism, and a bit more humility." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2016, Marvel {{announced}} that writer Kelly Thompson, who co-wrote A-Force vol. 2, #2, {{will take over}} the series with artist Ben Caldwell starting with issue 5. Thompson stated that while she respects the way Wilson built the team, {{in a world where}} women are the primary heroes, she does not intend on making stories that are [...] "unique to women". Thompson explained, [...] "It's a comic about super heroes saving the day, plain and simple, and <b>I</b> <b>approach</b> writing them like I would writing anyone. These ladies are heroes just like any of their male colleagues." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band's {{influences}} include Social Distortion, Wu-Tang Clan, Fugees, Faith No More, Queen, and Led Zeppelin. Jacoby Shaddix acknowledges Faith No More {{and their}} vocalist Mike Patton {{as a major}} influence, stating [...] "Mike Patton {{is one of my}} favorite singers. Faith No More, one of my favorite bands of all time. Very inspiring to me. I fell in love with that band at a very young age, and I saw them a few times growing up. I was bummed out when they parted ways , but they're doing shows again, which is awesome. As far as influence, the way that I sing, I definitely was inspired by Mike Patton, but lyrically, <b>I</b> <b>approach</b> my songs very differently than Mike Patton does. He comes from a place of a bit more sarcasm... a lot more sarcasm. Whereas I come from that heart and soul kind of place." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{a friend}} {{recommended}} English actress Lena Headey for the role, Friedman watched her audition tape, and {{thought she was}} [...] "a tough, tough woman". Having seen The Terminator {{when she was a}} teenager, which [...] "scared the hell out of" [...] her, Headey was aware of the iconic status of the character and in regards to Linda Hamilton's portrayal of the role in the film series, she remarked, [...] "Linda Hamilton will always be the original Sarah Connor and it's a very strong print that she's left, but hopefully people will embrace what I bring to Sarah and see it with fresh eyes". When asked about her approach to the role, Headey said [...] "I'm playing a mother who is a single parent, bringing up a teenage son, who also happens to save the world—as a byline to her life. And the way I would play that is someone who's passionate and scared and angry and a mother, all these things. So <b>I</b> <b>approach</b> that just trying to be honest within the boundaries of her". However, the choice to cast Headey was criticized by several fans and critics who argued that she bore no resemblance to the athletic, muscular woman established by Hamilton, who transformed her body into that of a muscled warrior for Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The controversy was covered by the Los Angeles Times, the Boston Herald, and The Guardian, as well as in online forums.|$|E

60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>approached</b> <b>I</b> found Dejah Thoris lying prone {{upon her}} silks and furs, her lithe form wracked with sobs. She {{did not notice}} my presence, nor did she hear me {{speaking}} with Sola, who was standing {{a short distance from}} the vehicle.|$|R
