40|$|A {{new method}} for <b>chemical</b> <b>identification</b> based on {{orthogonal}} parallel liquid chromatography separation and accurate molecular weight confirmationRecent {{advances in the}} theory and application of orthogonal LC separation have allowed {{for the establishment of}} a more effective method for the <b>chemical</b> <b>identification</b> of target compounds in complex samples, especially structurally similar compounds. In this study, a new <b>chemical</b> <b>identification</b> method based on orthogonal parallel separation and accurate molecular weight confirmation was developed. An orthogonal separation system consisting of an XTerra MS C- 18 column, a home-made Click OEG column, and a Click CD column was established for separation and identification. In addition, 82 flavonoids were selected as references, to be used for the construction of a library. Retention times of each reference flavonoid on each column and accurate molecular weights were recorded and imported into a searchable library as "tags" for the unknown screening. For the method validation, two complex mixtures, fractions of Dalbergia odorifera T. Chen and Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, specifically, were separated and identified. In total, nine compounds were unequivocally identified by retention time and confirmation of accurate molecular weight, demonstrating that this method is suitable and efficient for the <b>chemical</b> <b>identification</b> of complex samples.

Peak template matching is a technique for automatic <b>chemical</b> <b>identification.</b> Peak template matching can be formulated as a point pattern matching problem.

Search space pruning techniques based on peak location distributions and transformation distributions are also investigated for guided search. Experiments on seven real data sets indicate that the new techniques are effective. 1.

An overview of previous experimental results using a free electron laser (FEL) and more conventional infrared sources will be discussed.
