40|$|A {{series of}} sanding {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in a large <b>dust</b> <b>tunnel,</b> using an orbital sander with an aluminum oxide abrasive of 150 grit size, on twelve different hardwood species. Dust concentration measurements were taken using gravimetric isokinetic air-quality samplers. A field survey of 25 wooden furniture-manufacturing mills to ascertain the dust exposure levels at the sanding sections and also evaluate the labor productivity losses encountered among workers {{as a result of}} dust exposure. The results found that dust emission in the sanding process was primarily determined by the amount of wood removed. Further, the dust exposure levels at the sanding section in the furniture-manufacturing mills were above the standard 5 mg m - 3 level and hence, control of dust emission and the use of dust protection gears by the workers must be enforced in the furniture-manufacturing mills to ensure {{the health and safety of}} the workers. Without such measures, labor productivity among the workers would be reduced...|$|E

The relative efficiency of four types of eolian {{dust collectors}} was investigated by examining dust deposition efficiency in an eolian <b>dust</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and measuring long-term accumulation efficiency during a 24 -month field experiment in a desert environment. The deposition and accumulation surfaces of the collectors tested, were: (1) a dry and flat surface, (2) a flat but moist surface, (3) a surface composed of two superimposed layers of marbles, and (4) a free water surface. The water collector showed the highest efficiency, both for deposition and accumulation. Deposition efficiency of the marble collector was {{comparable to that of}} the water collector, but the former was more sensitive to post-depositional erosion. The effect of post-depositional erosion was most evident in the dry and the moist collectors tested. In general, deposition efficiency of the moist collector was lower than that of the dry collector. The latter was extremely sensitive to erosion, however, so that its accumulation efficiency was lower. Both collector types were less efficient than water and marble collectors for deposition as well as for accumulation. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Compound {{specific}} isotopic analysis (CSIA) {{can provide}} information {{about the origin of}} analysed compounds - in this case, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In the study, PAHs were extracted from three dust samples: winter and summer filter <b>dust</b> and <b>tunnel</b> <b>dust.</b> the measurement was performed using the method validated in our laboratory using pure, solid compounds and EPA 610 reference assortment. CSIA required an appropriate clean up method to avoid an unresolved complex in the gas chromatographic analysis usually found in the chromatography of PAHs. Extensive sample-clean-up for this particular matrix was found to be necessary to obtain good gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry analysis results. The sample purification method included two steps in which the sample is cleaned up and the aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons are separated. The concentration of PAHs in the measured samples was low; so a large volume injection technique (100 mu l) was applied. The delta VPDB 13 C was measured with a final uncertainty smaller than 1 °/°°. Comparison of the delta VPDB 13 C signatures of PAHs extracted from different dust samples was feasible with this method and doing so significant differences were observed. JRC. DG.

Comparing the measurement values from the tunnels and platforms with those found at the entrances to the underground railway stations, it emerges that dust concentration in the tunnels and platforms is three times higher, with a maximum PM 10 value of 479 microg/m 3.

The following parameters were measured: dust deposition on the pebbles, dust deposition between and underneath pebbles, total dust deposition (pebbles + inter-pebble space), and the fraction, of total deposition, of dust caught by the pebbles alone.

By heating the graphite furnace according to a multistep temperature program, spectral interferences were avoided, since a "dry" plasma was obtained, while "parent" ions such as Cu, Zn, and Pb, giving origin to interfering molecular ions, were vaporized during the thermal pretreatment step.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a simple physical concept of aeolian dust accumulation, {{based on the}} behaviour of the subprocesses of dust deposition and dust erosion. The concept is tested in an aeolian <b>dust</b> wind <b>tunnel.</b> The agreement between the accumulation curve predicted by the model and the accumulation curve obtained in the experiments is close to perfect and shows {{that it is necessary}} to discriminate between the processes of aeolian dust deposition and aeolian dust accumulation. Two important thresholds determine the accumulation process. For wind speeds below the deflation threshold, the aeolian accumulation of dust increases linearly with the wind speed. For wind velocities between the deflation threshold and the accumulation limit, the sedimentation balance is above unity and there is still accumulation, though it rapidly drops once the deflation threshold has been exceeded. At wind speeds beyond the accumulation limit, the sedimentation balance is below unity and there will no longer be an accumulation of dust. The thresholds have been determined in a wind tunnel test at friction velocity u(*) = 0. 34 m s(- 1) (deflation threshold) and u(*) = 0. 43 in s(- 1) (accumulation limit), but these values are only indicative since they depend heavily on the characteristics of the accumulation surface and of the airborne grains.

40|$|Currently, {{a lack of}} {{accurate}} emission data exits for {{particulate matter}} (PM) in agricultural air quality studies (USDA-AAQTF, 2000). PM samplers, however, tend to over estimate the concentration of most agricultural dusts because of {{the interaction of the}} particle size distribution (PSD) and performance characteristics of the sampler (Buser, 2004). This research attempts to find a practical method to characterize and correct this error for the Federal Reference Method (FRM) PM 10 sampler. First, a new <b>dust</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> testing facility that satisfies the USEPA?s requirement of testing PM 10 samplers was designed, built, and evaluated. Second, the wind tunnel testing protocol using poly-dispersed aerosol as the test dust was proved to be able to provide results consistent with mono-dispersed dusts. Third, this study quantified the variation of over sampling ratios for the various cut point and slopes of FRM PM 10 samplers and proposed an averaged over sampling ratio as a correction factor for various ranges of PSD. Finally, a method of using total suspended particle (TSP) samplers as a field reference for determining PM 10 concentrations and aerosol PSD was explored computationally. Overall, this dissertation developed successfully the methodology to correct the sampling error associated with the FRM PM 10 sampler: (1) wind tunnel testing facilities and protocol for experimental evaluation of samplers; (2) the variation of the oversampling ratios of FRM PM 10 samplers for computational evaluation of samplers; (3) the evaluation of TSP sampler effectiveness as a potential field reference for field evaluation of samplers...|$|R
40|$|This {{handbook}} describes effective {{methods for}} the control of mineral dusts in mines and tunnels. It assumes the reader is familiar with mining. The first chapter deals solely with dust control methods, regardless of the application. It is a brief tutorial on mining dust control and will be of help to the reader whose dust control problem does not conveniently fit any of the mining equipment niches described in later chapters. The subsequent chapters describe dust control methods for different kinds of mines and mining equipment. This includes underground coal and hard-rock mines, as well as surface mines, stone mines, and hard-rock <b>tunnels.</b> Because <b>dust</b> sampling has so many pitfalls, a chapter on methods used to sample dust is included. For those occasions {{when there is no}} practical engineering control, a chapter on respirators is also included. Except for those listed as "future possibilities" in the longwall chapter, the dust control methods described are practical and cost-effective for most mine operators. If controlling dust were a simple matter, <b>dust</b> problems in <b>tunnels</b> and mines would have been eradicated years ago. Unfortunately, most underground dust control methods yield only 25 % to 50 % reductions in respirable-sized dust. Often, 25 % to 50 % reductions are not enough to achieve compliance with dust standards. Thus, mine operators must use several methods simultaneously, usually without knowing for sure how well any individual method is working. In fact, given a 25 % error in dust sampling and day-to-day variations in dust generation of 50 % or more, certainty about which control methods are most effective can be wanting. Nevertheless, over the years, some consensus has emerged on the best dust control practices. This handbook summarizes those practices. " - NIOSHTIC- 21.

We investigate the chronology of platinum group elements (PGE) accumulation in dated sediments from an urban lake near Boston, MA. Chronological profiles demonstrate that Pt, Pd, and Rh concentrations increased following the introduction in catalysts with accumulation rates 6 - 16 times larger in 1992 - 2002 than prior to the introduction of catalysts. Ratios of these elements closely match their ratios in catalysts, providing further evidence of an automobile source. Iridium and Ru accumulation in sediments also increased following the introduction of catalysts, and while past Os contamination is associated with leather tanning, recent changes in the isotopic composition of Os indicate another anthropogenic source for this element. The PGE have similar geochemical properties and are difficult to separate from one another, and therefore, we suggest that automobile catalyst emissions also result in increasing environmental concentrations of Ir, Ru, and Os, which occur as impurities in catalysts.

40|$|Small {{amounts of}} dust will be {{deposited}} on {{the surfaces of}} waste packages in drifts at Yucca Mountain during the operational and the preclosure ventilation periods. Salts present in the dust will deliquesce as the waste packages cool and relative humidity in the drifts increases.

These arguments {{have been used to}} show that dust deliquescence-induced localized or crevice corrosion of the waste package outer barrier (Alloy 22) is of low consequence with respect to repository performance. Measured atmospheric and underground dust compositions are the basis of thermodynamic modeling and experimental studies to evaluate the likelihood of brine formation and persistence, the volume of brines that may form, and the relative corrosivity of the initial deliquescent brines and of brines modified by processes on the waste package surface.

Results: Concentrations on station platforms were 270 – 480 mg/m 3 PM 2. 5 and 14 000 – 29 000 particles/ cm 3. Cab concentrations over a shift averaged 130 – 200 mg/m 3 and 17 000 – 23 000 particles/cm 3. The dust comprised by mass approximately 67 % iron oxide, 1 – 2 % quartz, and traces of other metals, the residue being volatile matter. The finest particles are drawn underground from the surface while the coarser dust is generated by interaction of brakes, wheels, and rails. Taking account of durations of exposure, drivers and station staff would have maximum exposures of about 200 mg/m 3 over eight hours; the occupational exposure standard for welding fume, as iron oxide, is 5 mg/m 3 over an eight hour shift.

The use of its isotope signature allows tracing emissions to the increasing number of cars, urban construction, and industrial emissions in this densely populated area. High-precision and accurate stable isotope ratio determinations using isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) combined with particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and multivariate analysis were used to identify the main sources of lead present in São Paulo atmospheric particulates. Throughout a period of sixty days, aerosol samples were collected every 12 h during the summer of 2005 at the University of São Paulo (USP) and simultaneously during one week in an industrial area (Cubatão) and in two more remote areas (São Lourenço da Serra and Juquitiba). The data suggests that aerosols from São Paulo are mainly derived from vehicular exhaust (mostly gasoline) and traffic dust resuspension, with the admixture of industrial emissions, including cement.

Understanding the physical and chemical behavior of these brines is important because they define conditions under which brines may react with waste canister surfaces. Boiling point experiments show that NaCl-KNO{sub 3 }-NaNO{sub 3 } and NaCl-KNO{sub 3 }-NaNO{sub 3 }-Ca(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 2 } salt mixtures form brines that transform to hydrous melts that do not truly 'dry out' until temperatures exceed 300 and 400 C, respectively. Thus a conducting solution is present for these salt assemblages over the thermal history of the repository. The corresponding brines form at lower relative humidity at higher temperatures. The NaCl-KNO{sub 3 }-NaNO{sub 3 } salt mixture has a mutual deliquescence relative humidity (MDRH) of 25. 9 % at 120 C and 10. 8 % at 180 C. Similarly, the KNO{sub 3 }-NaNO{sub 3 } salt mixture has MDRH of 26. 4 % at 120 C and 20. 0 % at 150 C. The KNO{sub 3 }-NaNO{sub 3 } salt mixture salts also absorb some water (but {{do not appear to}} deliquesce) at 180 C and thus may also contribute to the transfer of electrons at interface between dust and the waste package surface. There is no experimental evidence to suggest that these brines will degas and form less deliquescent salt assemblages. Ammonium present in atmospheric and <b>tunnel</b> <b>dust</b> (as the chloride, nitrate, or sulfate) will readily decompose in the initial heating phase of the repository, and will affect subsequent behavior of the remaining salt mixture only through the removal of a stoichiometric equivalent of one or more anions.

In general, the 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios of road dusts can be used to estimate the direct contribution from automobile emissions, whereas those of gully sediments might reflect the effects of the mixing of different anthropogenic sources. The Pb isotope signatures in the urban environment of Hong Kong clearly suggested that anthropogenic Pb in the environment originated from Pb ore with a low 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratio (such as the Australian Pb ore and similar sources in Southeast Asia) were significantly different from those of the anthropogenic Pb present in the neighboring Pearl River Delta (PRD) region.
