In 2003, 91% of fathers with children aged under 15 years were employed with 85% employed full-time.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics show that approximately 7% of two parents <b>families</b> <b>with</b> <b>children</b> under the age of 14 have a father who is unemployed and a mother who works full-time. Stay at home dads in Australia have almost doubled over the past decade from 57,900 to 106,000, and expected to increase in the future. Recent sociological studies have shown that men are dedicating more time and support to their children in comparison to the 19th century. The idea of a stay at home dad were far from mainstream, however the rising demand for female work has influenced this statistic to rise.|$|E
