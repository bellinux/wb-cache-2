5|$|A few hip-hop dance shows {{appeared}} {{on television in}} the 1990s such as 1991's The Party Machine with Nia Peeples and 1992's The Grind. Several hip-hop dance shows premiered in the 2000s including (but not limited to) Dance Fever, Dance 360, The Wade Robson Project, MTV Dance Crew, America's Best Dance Crew, Dance on Sunset, and Shake It Up. In 2006, MTV France documented {{the creation of a}} dance crew for an original series called MTV Dance Crew. Viewers were able to see the crew from auditions to the selection of the final eight who were subsequently named Original Soul. Original Soul was coached by three professional choreographers who mentored them and helped refine their dancing. Over the course of 32 episodes they routinely participated in professional dance battles including the popping battle at Juste <b>Debout,</b> the Seven 2 Smoke battle at The Notorious IBE, and b-boy battles at Chelles Battle Pro. B-boy Lilou, b-boy crew Phase T, and promoter Bruce Ykanji (the founder of Juste <b>Debout)</b> all made appearances during the show.|$|E

However, in 1914, the war broke out and movie-making ground to a halt. Everyone was called up {{to serve in the}} army, including Léonce, who for a time was conscripted as a nurse's aide in Niort as he was unable to fight due to his health problems. At Léon Gaumont's request he returned to filmmaking in 1915 to make several patriotic shorts like Françaises, veillez! (Frenchwomen, take care!), a short film warning women on the home front to be aware of possible traitors. Soon after, he released <b>Debout</b> les morts, a film based on one of Victor Hugo's novels.|$|E

25|$|The early {{sculptures of}} Jacques Lipchitz, 1911-1912, were {{conventional}} portraits and figure studies executed {{in the tradition}} of Aristide Maillol and Charles Despiau. He progressively turned toward Cubism in 1914 with periodic reference to Negro sculpture. His 1915 Baigneuse is comparable to figures from Gabun. In 1916 his figures became more abstract, though less so than those of Brâncuși's sculptures of 1912-1915. Lipchitz' Baigneuse Assise (70.5cm) of 1916 is clearly reminiscent of Csaky's 1913 Figure de Femme <b>Debout,</b> 1913 (Figure Habillée) (80cm), exhibited in Paris at the Salon des Indépendants in the spring of 1913, with the same architectonic rendering of the shoulders, head, torso, and lower body, both with an angular pyramidal, cylidrical and spherical geometric armature. Just as some of the works of Picasso and Braque of the period are virtually indistinguishable, so too are Csaky's and Lipchitz sculptures, only Csaky's predates that of Lipchitz by three years.|$|E

Breaking is not included to put more focus on dance styles performed while standing up, hence the name (French for Just Standing). There are not any team trophies at Juste <b>Debout.</b> The experimental and toprock categories are only for solo dancers; popping, new style, locking, and house are for duos.

500|$|YAK Films is a three-man {{team that}} films urban dance around the world. It {{was founded in}} Oakland, California by Yoram Savion and Kash Grimes. Their first videos were of the Turf Feinz dance crew {{performing}} turfing—a regional hip-hop dance style from Oakland. After generating significant views on YouTube, they started YAK (Yoram And Kash) Films and added music producer Ben [...] "B'zwax" [...] Tarquin to the team. From shooting videos only in the United States, {{they were able to}} easily transition to covering dance events in Europe due to Savion's dual French citizenship. In 2009, they filmed Battle of the Year's first one-on-one b-boy competition, and in 2010 they filmed dance battles at Juste <b>Debout,</b> a French street dance competition. In addition to filming dance events and original freestyle performances, they post tutorials and upload a weekly web series called [...] "YAK Like You Know". Some of their more popular videos have been featured in Oakland Local and the Huffington Post.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{reported}} attempt at sclerotherapy was by D Zollikofer in Switzerland, 1682 who injected an acid into a vein to induce thrombus formation. [...] Both <b>Debout</b> and Cassaignaic reported success in treating varicose veins by injecting perchlorate of iron in 1853. Desgranges in 1854 cured 16 cases of varicose veins by injecting iodine and tannin into the veins. This was approximately 12 {{years after the}} probable advent of great saphenous vein stripping in 1844 by Madelung. However, due to high rates of side-effects with the drugs used at the time, sclerotherapy had been practically abandoned by 1894. With the improvements in surgical techniques and anaesthetics over that time, stripping became the treatment of choice.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Salah {{became a}} brand {{ambassador}} for Puma. Through this partnership, Puma launched a dance project called [...] "Puma the Quest" [...] that gave five dancers {{the opportunity to}} travel the world and be personally mentored by Salah. The street dancers were chosen from hundreds of video submissions which were narrowed down to {{a core group of}} 20. The core group had to perform live in front of a panel of judges including singer Nawell Madani, rapper Youssoupha, and Salah himself. The five winners—Lara Laquiz, Tiet Sofian, Steph 2SL, Anto, and b-boy Ska—were announced the following day at the Juste <b>Debout</b> 2013 finals. They traveled with Salah to New York City, Berlin, Tokyo, Paris, London, and Los Angeles to learn about the street culture within each city.

60|$|On the twenty-third of August, Committee of Public Salvation, {{as usual}} through Barrere, had promulgated, in words not unworthy of remembering, their Report, which is soon {{made into a}} Law, of Levy in Mass. 'All France, and {{whatsoever}} it contains of men or resources, is put under requisition,' says Barrere; really in Tyrtaean words, the best we know of his. 'The Republic is one vast besieged city.' Two hundred and fifty Forges shall, in these days, be {{set up in the}} Luxembourg Garden, and round the outer wall of the Tuileries; to make gun-barrels; in sight of Earth and Heaven! From all hamlets, towards their Departmental Town; from all their Departmental Towns, towards the appointed Camp and seat of war, the Sons of Freedom shall march; their banner is to bear: 'Le Peuple Francais <b>debout</b> contres les Tyrans, The French People risen against Tyrants.' 'The young men shall go to the battle; it is their task to conquer: the married men shall forge arms, transport baggage and artillery; provide subsistence: the women shall work at soldiers' clothes, make tents; serve in the hospitals. The children shall scrape old-linen into surgeon's-lint: the aged men shall have themselves carried into public places; and there, by their words, excite the courage of the young; preach hatred to Kings and unity to the Republic.' (Debats, Seance du 23 Aout 1793.) Tyrtaean words, which tingle through all French hearts.|$|E
6000|$|Your {{letter of}} the 15th has come--and may this reach you as directly, though it {{probably}} won't. No, I won't make it long--the less that the irrelevance of all remark, the utter extinction of everything, {{in the face of}} these immensities, leaves me as [...] "all silent and all damned" [...] as you express that it leaves you. I find it the strangest state to have lived on and on for--and yet, with its wholesale annihilation, it is somehow life. Mary Cadwal is admirably here--interesting and vivid and helpful to the last degree, and Bessie Lodge and her boy had the heavenly beauty, this afternoon, to come down from town (by train s'entend) rien que for tea--she even sneakingly went first to the inn for luncheon--and was off again by 5.30, nobly kind and beautiful and good. (She sails in the Olympic with her aunt on Saturday.) Mary C. gives me a sense of the interest of your Paris which makes me understand how it must attach you--how it would attach me in your place. Infinitely thrilling and touching such a community with the so all-round incomparable nation. I feel on my side an immense community here, where the tension is proportionate to the degree to which we feel engaged--in other words up to the chin, up to the eyes, if necessary. Life goes on after a fashion, but I find it a nightmare from which there is no waking save by sleep. I go to sleep, as if I were dog-tired with action--yet feel like the chilled vieillards in the old epics, infirm and helpless at home with the women, while the plains are ringing with battle. The season here is monotonously magnificent--and we look inconceivably off across the blue channel, the lovely rim, toward the nearness of the horrors that are in perpetration just beyond.... I manage myself to try to [...] "work"--even if I had, after experiment, to give up trying to make certain little fantoches and their private adventure tenir <b>debout.</b> They are laid by on the shelf--the private adventure so utterly blighted by the public; but I have got hold of something else, and I find the effort of concentration to some extent an antidote. Apropos of which I thank you immensely for D'Annunzio's frenchified ode--a wondrous and magnificent thing in its kind, even if running too much--for my [...] "taste"--to the vituperative and the execrational. The Latin Renascence mustn't be too much for and by that--for which its facile resources are so great.... What's magnificent to me in the French themselves at this moment is their lapse of expression.... May this not fail of you! I am your all-faithfully tender and true old ...|$|E
6000|$|I wrote you a scrabbly {{note from}} Ravenna {{a few days}} since--but I must follow it up, without delay, with {{something}} better. I came on here an hour afterwards, and shall remain till June 1st or 2nd. I find Rome deliriously cool and empty, and still very pleasing {{in spite of the}} [...] "ruining" [...] which has been going on so long and of which one has heard so much, i.e., the redemption and cockneyfication of the ruins. This [...] "changes" [...] immensely--as everyone says; but I find myself, I am afraid, so much more changed--since I first knew and rhapsodized over it, that I am bound in justice to hold Rome the less criminal of the two. I am thinking a little about going down--if the coolness lasts--for three or four days to Naples; but I haven't decided. I feel rather hard and heartless to be prattling about these touristries to you, with the sad picture I have had these last weeks of your--William's--state of suffering. But it is only a way of saying that that state makes one feel it to be the greater duty for me to be as well as I can. Absit omen! Your so interesting letter of the 6th dictated to Alice speaks of the possibility of your abscess continuing not to heal--but I trust the event has long ere this reassured, comforted and liberated you. Meanwhile may Alice have smoothed your pillow as even she has never smoothed it before.... As regards the life, the power, the temper, the humour and beauty and expressiveness of the Diary in itself--these things were partly [...] "discounted" [...] to me in advance by so much of Alice's talk during her last years--and my constant association with her--which led me often to reflect about her extraordinary force of mind and character, her whole way of taking life--and death--in very much {{the manner in which the}} book does. I find in its pages, for instance, many things I heard her say. None the less I have been immensely impressed with the thing as a revelation of a moral and personal picture. It is heroic in its individuality, its independence--its face-to-face with the universe for and by herself--and the beauty and eloquence with which she often expresses this, let alone the rich irony and humour, constitute (I wholly agree with you) a new claim for the family renown. This last element--her style, her power to write--are indeed to me a delight--for I have had many letters from her. Also it brings back to me all sorts of things I am glad to keep--I mean things that happened, hours, occasions, conversations--brings them back with a strange, living richness. But it also puts before me what I was tremendously conscious of in her life-time--that the extraordinary intensity of her will and personality really would have made the equal, the reciprocal, life of a [...] "well" [...] person--in the usual world--almost impossible to her--so that her disastrous, her tragic health was in a manner the only solution for her of the practical problem of life--as it suppressed the element of equality, reciprocity, etc. The violence of her reaction against her British ambiente, against everything English, engenders some of her most admirable and delightful passages--but I feel in reading them, as I always felt in talking with her, that inevitably she simplified too much, shut up in her sick room, exercised her wondrous vigour of judgment on too small a scrap of what really surrounded her. It would have been modified in many ways if she had lived with them (the English) more--seen more of the men, etc. But doubtless it is fortunate for the fun and humour of the thing that it wasn't modified--as surely the critical emotion (about them,) the essence of much of their nature, was never more beautifully expressed. As for her allusions to H.--they fill me with tears and cover me with blushes.... I find an immense eloquence in her passionate [...] "radicalism"--her most distinguishing feature almost--which, in her, was absolutely direct and original (like everything that was in her,) unreflected, uncaught from entourage or example. It would really have made her, had she lived in the world, a feminine [...] "political force." [...] But had she lived in the world and seen things nearer she would have had disgusts and disillusions. However, what comes out in the book--as it came out to me in fact--is that she was really an Irishwoman; transplanted, transfigured--yet none the less fundamentally national--in spite of her so much larger and finer than Irish intelligence. She felt the Home Rule question absolutely as only an Irishwoman (not anglicised) could. It was a tremendous emotion with her--inexplicable in any other way--but perfectly explicable by [...] "atavism." [...] What a pity she wasn't born there--and had her health for it. She would have been (if, always, she had not fallen a victim to disgust--a large [...] "if") a national glory! But I am writing too much and my late hindrances have left me with tremendous arrears of correspondence. I thank you, dear Alice, caramente, for your sweet letter received two or three weeks before William's. I crudely hope you won't let your house--so as to have it to go to in the summer. Otherwise what will become of you. I dig my nose into the fleshiest parts of the young Francis. Tell Peggy I cling to her--and to Harry too, and Billy not less.... I haven't sent you [...] "The Yellow Book"--on purpose; and indeed I have been weeks and weeks receiving a copy of it myself. I say on purpose because although my little tale which ushers it in ("The Death of the Lion") appears to have had, for a thing of mine, an unusual success, I hate too much the horrid aspect and company of the whole publication. And yet I am again to be intimately, conspicuously associated with the 2d number. It is for gold and to oblige the worshipful Harland (the editor).
