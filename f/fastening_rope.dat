50|$|Rope is of {{paramount}} importance in fields as diverse as construction, seafaring, exploration, sports, theatre, and communications, and has been used since prehistoric times. To <b>fasten</b> <b>rope,</b> many types of knots have been invented for countless uses.Pulleys redirect the pulling force to another direction, and can create mechanical advantage so that multiple strands of rope share a load and multiply the force applied to the end. Winches and capstans are machines designed to pull ropes.|$|R
60|$|Tarzan grinned as he {{approached}} to discover what the blacks would do to their prisoner. Doubtless they would slay him at once. Again Tarzan grinned. Now he could have Teeka for his own, with none to dispute his right to her. As he watched, he saw the black warriors strip the screen from about the cage, <b>fasten</b> <b>ropes</b> to it and drag it away along the trail {{in the direction of}} their village.|$|R
25|$|After {{successful}} kills, {{the women}} processed the bison meat, {{skin and bones}} for various uses: the flesh was sliced into strips and dried on poles over slow fires before being stored. Prepared in this way, it was usable for several months. Although the Pawnee preferred buffalo, they also hunted other game, including elk, bear, panther, and skunk, for meat and skins. The skins were used for clothing and accessories, storage bags, foot coverings, <b>fastening</b> <b>ropes</b> and ties, etc.|$|R
60|$|Here he <b>fastened</b> the <b>rope</b> {{securely}} to a stout branch, and then, descending, plunged {{his hunting}} knife into Kulonga's heart. Kala was avenged.|$|R
5000|$|The phad is set by <b>fastening</b> the <b>rope</b> {{that runs}} through the red band sewn on at the top to wooden poles set at each end.|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] he said, [...] "I've roped one of {{his hind}} legs. Now we'll pull him up a little, then we'll <b>fasten</b> this <b>rope,</b> and pull on the other." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{rose and}} {{walked along the}} edge of the ravine till they were above the wall, then, <b>fastening</b> the <b>rope</b> to a stump, they slid down on to it.|$|R
60|$|The lad <b>fastened</b> the <b>rope</b> {{which held}} the dinghy to a {{stanchion}} beside the tiller. Then {{he and his}} father proceeded to hoist the foresail so as to get the boat's head round.|$|R
6000|$|... "No man shall {{encounter}} dangers {{from which}} I shrink. Lower away slowly, boys," [...] he added {{to those who}} were <b>fastening</b> a <b>rope</b> to the car, [...] "and keep a sharp look-out for our signals." ...|$|R
50|$|Swam the Rio Grande de Pampanga in {{face of the}} enemy's {{fire and}} <b>fastened</b> a <b>rope</b> to {{occupied}} trenches, thereby enabling the crossing {{of the river and}} the driving of the enemy from his fortified position.|$|R
60|$|All hands worked hard; {{inch by inch}} {{the water}} rose; Mr Harvey, {{assisted}} by the boys and teamsters, <b>fastened</b> <b>ropes</b> together, and with these surrounded the closely-packed throng of cattle. The water was now more than waist-deep, and was still rising; soon the cattle on the outside were lifted off their feet. There was no current here, and they floated with their heads {{on the backs of}} those in front of them; higher and higher the water rose, till the whole of the cattle were afloat. At first a few struggled, but soon they subsided into quiet, and the whole mass floated together, with only their heads above water.|$|R

6000|$|... "There are {{too many}} 'if's' in that suggestion," [...] remarked the little Wizard. [...] "And you must {{remember}} {{that the other side}} is nothing but spinning mountains, so we couldn't possibly <b>fasten</b> a <b>rope</b> to them, even if we had one." ...|$|R
60|$|The pirate-chief had hanged himself. With difficulty, {{but with}} {{inflexible}} resolution, he had accomplished his purpose by <b>fastening</b> the <b>rope</b> round {{his neck and}} lifting his legs off the ground, {{so that he was}} actually found suspended in a sitting posture.|$|R
60|$|When dead, a Man {{brings in}} two Mules dress'd out with Bells and Feathers, and <b>fastening</b> a <b>Rope</b> about his Horns, draws off the Bull with the Shouts and Acclamations of the Spectators; {{as if the}} Infidels had been drove from before Ceuta.|$|R
60|$|Some {{tried to}} hoist their sails; others got out long oars and strove to sweep their vessels towards the shore, {{but they were}} huddled too closely in the stream; the yards and rigging of many having become {{interlocked}} with each other. The Northmen leaped into the rowing boats by the bank above where the tower-ships had been moored, and rowing down endeavoured to tow them to the bank; but they were now in a blaze from end to end, the heat {{was so great that}} it was difficult to approach them, and all endeavours to <b>fasten</b> <b>ropes</b> to them were frustrated, as these were instantly consumed. The Northmen, finding their efforts unavailing, then turned their attention to trying to tow the ships below to the banks.|$|R
60|$|It {{was also}} {{exceedingly}} fortunate that the whale {{had been killed}} a little before the time of high water, because that enabled them to <b>fasten</b> <b>ropes</b> through its nose and row with it still farther in to the shore. This accomplished, the boats made several trips {{back to the ship}} and landed all the men, and these, with a number of ropes, hauled up the carcase foot by foot as the tide rose. After reaching a certain point at high water they could get it up no farther, and when the tide turned all the men twice doubled could not have budged it an inch. The ropes were therefore tied together and lengthened until they reached a strong tree near the beach, to which they were fastened.|$|R
60|$|While {{they were}} {{speaking}} they had unwound the <b>rope,</b> <b>fastened</b> {{one end to}} the battlement, and lowered the other down.|$|R
60|$|The man on {{the ladder}} now joined them; and {{together}} they quietly lifted the schoolmaster, and carried him to the window. They then <b>fastened</b> a <b>rope</b> round the prisoner's body, lifted him out on to the ladder, and lowered him gradually down to the men below.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{fishermen}} {{can talk}} of nothing else," [...] Nora put in excitedly. [...] "Mummy, {{it was simply}} splendid! Helen and I had gone up {{with two of the}} rescued men, but I got back {{just in time to see}} them <b>fasten</b> the <b>rope</b> round his waist and watch him plunge in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hard an' fast she is," [...] sang out Jeff Lynn, as he <b>fastened</b> the <b>rope</b> {{to a tree}} at {{the head}} of a small island. [...] "All off now, and' we'll hev' supper. Thar's a fine spring under yon curly birch, an' I fetched along a leg of deer-meat. Hungry, little 'un?" ...|$|R
60|$|Still {{they did}} not dare to sleep until each had <b>fastened</b> a <b>rope</b> round his waist and bound himself to the flooring. Having done so, each laid himself {{alongside}} of a turn of the binding-cable, and, embracing that affectionately with both arms, laid {{his head on the}} planks and shut his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Ten {{minutes later}} they were under way. The breeze had almost died out, and after sailing for some two miles in nearly a {{straight}} course, the boat was thrown over, two men got into it, and, <b>fastening</b> a <b>rope</b> to the ketch's bow, proceeded to tow her along, the captain taking the helm.|$|R
60|$|On {{arriving}} Bok first <b>fastened</b> to the <b>rope</b> {{the package}} he had brought, which was drawn on board, {{and then the}} rope was lowered again.|$|R
60|$|This plan delighted the boys, {{and they}} all {{pronounced}} in its favor; but the oldest one suggested {{that it would be}} better to <b>fasten</b> the <b>ropes</b> to the trunk before they began to saw upon it, and another boy asked how they were going to keep the tree standing when they hauled her up again.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{the wall}} {{were not so}} high {{it would be easy}} enough, Jake, for we could do it by <b>fastening</b> the <b>rope</b> within about three inches of the end of a pole six feet long and three inches thick. That would never pull over the wall, but it is too high to throw the pole over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've found a rope!" [...] Inga {{called down}} to him; {{and then the}} boy {{proceeded}} to make a loop in {{one end of the}} rope, for the King to put his arms through, and the other end he placed over the drum of the windlass. He now aroused Bilbil and <b>fastened</b> the <b>rope</b> firmly around the goat's shoulders.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] {{said the}} relative, [...] "I want you, {{like a good}} boy, to <b>fasten</b> the <b>rope</b> to the brick and tie it around your damned neck and jump into the pond and drown yourself. In a few days I will send and have you fished up and buried because I shall need to dance on your grave." ...|$|R

5000|$|Details of Watts' {{life are}} {{documented}} {{in a book}} published in 1911, Harry Watts - Sailor and Diver by Alfred Spencer.

He swam to the captain, <b>fastened</b> the <b>rope</b> round him and helped him to the ladder which was hanging over the ship's side." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} is {{from modern}} times. They were granted on 28 September 1990. The arms feature three gold heldrer, a traditional tool {{made of wood}} for <b>fastening</b> a <b>rope</b> around a load. They are meant to symbolize unity {{as well as the}} importance of forestry. Three of these objects appear in yellow and they are centered on a field of red.|$|R
60|$|When Inga went to <b>fasten</b> the <b>rope</b> {{a second}} time he was rejoiced to {{discover}} that by moving one more block of marble he could uncover the tile with the secret spring. So the three pulled with renewed energy and to their joy the block moved and rolled upon its side, leaving Inga free to remove the treasure when he pleased.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, {{you will}} never get the waggons on in that way, the oxen cannot pull an ounce. The best way will be to unyoke them, take them across, and get {{them up on the}} level ground on the top; then <b>fasten</b> your <b>ropes</b> {{together}} and hitch them to the waggon. The bullocks, on firm ground, can easily pull it across." ...|$|R
