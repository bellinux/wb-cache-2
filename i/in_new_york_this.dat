5|$|Benchley {{filled in}} for P. G. Wodehouse at Vanity Fair at the {{beginning}} of 1916, reviewing theatre <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>This</b> inspired staff at the Tribune magazine to creativity for articles (such as arranging for the producers of The Thirteenth Chair to cast Benchley as a corpse), but the situation at the magazine deteriorated as the pacifist Benchley became unhappy with the Tribunes position on World War I, and the Tribune editors were unhappy with the evolving tone and irreverence of the magazine. In 1917, the Tribune shut down the magazine, and Benchley was out of work again. When a rumored opening for an editorial position at Vanity Fair fell through, Benchley decided he would continue freelancing, having {{made a name for himself}} at the magazine.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, {{after school}} and having {{enrolled}} at university, Waldron was called up by the army, and was based at West Point, <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>This</b> allowed him {{to listen to the}} greats of jazz in clubs on 52nd Street and elsewhere in the city. After two years in the army, he returned as a student to Queens College in New York, where he studied under composer Karol Rathaus and made the final decision to switch from saxophone to piano. This decision was influenced in part by hearing Charlie Parker's virtuoso speed on saxophone, and by not having the extroverted personality Waldron thought necessary for that instrument. Not yet a professional musician, he received money through the G.I. Bill and continued to live with his parents. After obtaining a B.A. in music in 1949, Waldron worked for a short time in rhythm and blues bands, including with Big Nick Nicholas.|$|E
5|$|Pat O'Connor, a {{champion}} amateur wrestler who had competed at the Pan American and the British Empire Games, {{was discovered by}} visiting American wrestlers Joe Pazandak and Butch Levy and taken back to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he eventually became a major star in the National Wrestling Alliance and the American Wrestling Association. On 9 January 1959, O'Connor defeated Dick Hutton in St. Louis, Missouri {{to become the first}} wrestler from New Zealand to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Over the next 20 years, many other wrestlers from New Zealand became big name stars in the United States. Abe Jacobs {{was among the first to}} follow O'Connor to the US and later challenged him for the NWA World title <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>This</b> was the first time two New Zealanders fought for a world heavyweight championship, and on foreign soil.|$|E

5|$|The {{portion of}} NY386 between Scottsville and Chili was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} Route16, an unsigned legislative route, in 1908. This section of Route16 became part of Route15 in 1921. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>this</b> segment of Route15 was incorporated into NY251, a new route established {{as part of the}} renumbering. NY386 was assigned by the following year to the portion of its modern routing north of NY31. It was extended south to Scottsville over former NY251 on July 1, 1977. In 2007, ownership and maintenance of most of NY386 between NY33A and NY104 was transferred from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to Monroe County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government.|$|E
5|$|We were in {{a studio}} <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>this</b> place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E
5|$|Zappa uniquely {{contributed to}} the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, {{sampling}} radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also {{contributed to the}} radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only in It for the Money (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only in It for the Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only in It for the Money, as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow Never Knows. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The cover art was provided by Cal Schenkel whom Zappa met <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>This</b> initiated a lifelong collaboration in which Schenkel designed covers for numerous Zappa and Mothers albums.|$|E

25|$|By 1887, the Roanoke was {{operating}} on the route from New York City to Norfolk, Virginia, and among its passengers were often European Mormon immigrants making their way to Salt Lake City, Utah. The immigrants landed in New York and were processed by New York State officials at Castle Garden Immigration Depot in Lower Manhattan. Until 1887, Mormon immigrants had traveled onwards by rail using tickets arranged by Mormon agents <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>This</b> changed following attempts by the Grand Trunk Line Immigration Clearing House Commission to monopolize rail travel by the immigrants and raise the fares. At the same time one of the New York Board of Commissioners of Emigration attempted to block Mormon immigration entirely. Faced with these challenges, Mormon leaders negotiated a new route for the immigrants to take. After processing at Castle Garden, immigrants took the overnight trip {{on one of the}} Old Dominion's steamers to Norfolk, from where they picked up the Norfolk and Western Railroad service. This voyage remained a primary route for Mormon emigrants until the federal government took over immigration in the state of New York on April 19, 1890. During this period, more than 5,000 Mormon emigrants in forty companies traveled on the Old Dominion line.|$|E
