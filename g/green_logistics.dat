H 577 P ISE 2016 Zhangxiii, 205 pages :color illustrationsGlobal warming, {{environment}} deterioration {{and government}} regulation arouse {{the awareness of}} academic researchers and industrial practitioners to consider green strategies in logistics industry, which prompts the research of <b>green</b> <b>logistics.</b> <b>Green</b> <b>logistics</b> involves a number of activities which are operated {{for the purpose of}} sustainable development. The performance of <b>green</b> <b>logistics</b> cannot be measured simply in an economic way, but in a more comprehensive and sustainable way by taking account of environmental and social considerations as well. In order to facilitate the development of <b>green</b> <b>logistics,</b> the activities of <b>green</b> <b>logistics</b> shall be analyzed and modeled by incorporating the latest environmental and social requirements. Most of the activities in <b>green</b> <b>logistics</b> can be modelled as combinatorial optimization problems with single or multiple objectives, constraints and decision variables. Exact algorithms are less popular to solve these combinatorial optimization problems due to their high complexity and large scale. In this research, swarm intelligence is employed to solve the combinatorial optimization problems derived from <b>green</b> <b>logistics.</b> The integration of <b>green</b> <b>logistics</b> and swarm intelligence is pioneering, which helps to solve the <b>green</b> <b>logistics</b> problems efficiently and broaden the application scope of swarm intelligence simultaneously. Two typical activities, i. e., vehicle scheduling and network design, are chosen to exemplify the modeling of <b>green</b> <b>logistics</b> activities and the application of swarm intelligence. The first activity is to propose an environmental vehicle routing model, which measures the carbon dioxide emission in addition to the economic cost along with the vehicle travelling. The second activity is to design a supply chain network with multiple distribution channels, which meets the development requirements of e-commerce. Swarm intelligence is employed to solve both problems by integrating with other programming skills. The results show that the modeling of <b>green</b> <b>logistics</b> activities are practicable and necessary, and swarm intelligence is capable and competitive to solve <b>green</b> <b>logistics</b> problems. The contribution of this research is the modeling of <b>green</b> <b>logistics</b> activities by integrating the concept of sustainable development and the design of swarm intelligence into solving combinatorial optimization problems. Both the activity modeling and algorithm design can provide useful insights and guidance for the interdisciplinary research of <b>green</b> <b>logistics</b> and swarm intelligence. Moreover, a unified swarm intelligence algorithm framework is proposed in consideration of the common procedures and operators from different swarm intelligence algorithms and a number of strategies are provided as well for the implementation of this unified algorithm framework.

40|$|The role of {{logistics}} has, {{over the}} last decade, evolved into a significant determinant in the operations of businesses. Increased efficiency and reduced operational costs can be established through a well-operated transportation system. Due to societies increased awareness for environmental issues, the logistics industry has been affected, {{which has led to}} a demand for development. Therefore, the concept of <b>green</b> <b>logistics</b> has become more common in the transportation industry. However, in South Africa this concept is lessestablished and {{there is a need to}} investigate managerial perceptions further. This research investigates <b>green</b> <b>logistics,</b> as perceived by managers in the transportation industry in South Africa. This thesis aims to study <b>green</b> <b>logistics</b> activities in South Africa at large transportation companies. The authors explore the current green logistic activities at the transportationcompanies, the managerial perceptions regarding <b>green</b> <b>logistics,</b> and their views of incentives and barriers to its implementation. The literature review presents the major theories and concepts included in <b>green</b> <b>logistics.</b> This section will present the reader with a deeper knowledge of sustainability, the triple bottom line, <b>green</b> <b>logistics,</b> and strategic environmental environment. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were used in this study. Six companies were interviewed and one South African logistical researcher. Secondary data was also used to get a deeper understanding of <b>green</b> <b>logistics</b> in South Africa. Interviews were held at the headquarters of the transportation companies, which were all resided in Johannesburg. Three international companies, three domestic companies (all with global operations), and one logistics researcher were interviewed. This gave the authors well-rounded empirical findings. The results from the interviews were divided into three categories: responsibility, <b>green</b> <b>logistics</b> activities, and managerial perceptions.

40|$|Considering {{its strong}} {{environmental}} impact, logistics plays {{a critical role}} in green supply chain management. It provides strategic links in the supply chain and is an essential function in the delivery of green products to the consumer. There is a general consensus on the fact that more environmentally sustainable companies may be achieved only if transport and logistics activities also become greener. To achieve this objective, buyer companies need to incorporate green considerations in the purchasing of transport and logistics services. This appears particularly challenging for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) because of their traditional lack of managerial, organisational and financial resources that often result in failure to adopt an environmental perspective. In the extant literature, green purchasing has received increased attention over the past decade and the strategic importance of introducing green aspects into purchasing practices has been recognised. However, little has been written in relation to purchasing <b>green</b> transport and <b>logistics</b> services. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore practices in the buying of <b>green</b> transport and <b>logistics</b> services and to derive implications for small buyer companies. The paper analyses how general environmental company ambitions and environmental purchasing practices are reflected when <b>green</b> transport and <b>logistics</b> services are purchased in three different European countries (Italy, Ireland and Sweden) using a multiple case study research approach. The results of the paper indicate that while the case companies show a relatively high concern for green issues at corporate level, a lower importance is attributed to green issues at the purchasing function level. When green concerns in the purchasing of transport and logistics services are analysed the level of importance decreases further. Thus, a conflicting attitude is evident between the overall corporate level and the purchasing of transport and logistics services specifically. This suggests that there is potential for improvement especially in the area of green collaboration in buyer and supplier relationships...|$|R
