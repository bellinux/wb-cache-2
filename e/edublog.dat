Options for expressing individualistic opinion and approach towards presentation of one’s thoughts are the hallmark features of new media. Among the numerous new media tools, blogs are increasingly being used in academic environments for their ease in use, publication and administration. Their ease in access anytime, anywhere make them ideal for asynchronous training and learning purposes as the blogs are being written by the students, teachers and other educational stakeholders, as an individual and also as a group. For the research, High School based educational blogs, i. e., <b>edublogs,</b> were investigated in context of their host websites. To narrow the scope, Science <b>edublogs</b> were selected as this subject requires {{a great deal of}} visual presentation for improving comprehension of various concepts, experiments, complex phenomenon through diagrams, photographs, simulations, and other multimedia tools and techniques.

5000|$|An <b>edublog</b> is a blog {{created for}} {{educational}} purposes. Edublogs archive and support {{student and teacher}} learning by facilitating reflection, questioning by self and others, collaboration and by providing contexts for engaging in higher-order thinking. [...] Edublogs proliferated when blogging architecture became more simplified and teachers perceived the instructional potential of blogs as an online resource. The use of blogs has become popular in education institutions including public schools and colleges. Blogs can be useful tools for sharing information and tips among co-workers, providing information for students, or keeping in contact with parents. Common examples include blogs written by or for teachers, blogs maintained {{for the purpose of}} classroom instruction, or blogs written about educational policy. Educators who blog are sometimes called edubloggers.|$|E
5000|$|Weblogs {{have existed}} {{for close to}} two decades. However, it wasn't until {{the second half of}} the 1990s that weblogs began to grow in popularity. In 1998, there were just a handful of sites of the type that are now {{identified}} as weblogs (so named by Jorn Barger in December 1997). In 1999, there were 23 known weblogs, and Pitas http://www.pitas.com/, the first free build your own weblog tool, was launched. Also in 1999 weblogs changed from a mix of links, commentary, and thoughts, to short form journal entries. An early recorded use of the term [...] "edublog" [...] can be traced to a webring called the <b>Edublog</b> WebRing, founded on January 30, 2002. The new use of weblogs are largely interest driven and attract readers who have similar interests. In 2004, there were an estimated 3 million blogs and as of July 2011, there are an estimated 164 million blogs.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} uses of <b>edublogs.</b> Some bloggers use their blogs as a {{learning}} journal or a knowledge log to gather relevant information and ideas, and communicate with other people. Some teachers use blogs to keep in contact with students' parents. Some bloggers use blogs to record their own personal life, and express emotions or feelings. Some instructors use blogs as an instructional and assessment tool, and blogs {{can be used as}} a task management tool. Blogs are used to teach individuals about writing for an audience as they can be made public, and blogging software makes it easier to create content for the Web without knowing much HTML.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} teacher-related blogs on the {{internet}} where teachers can share information with one another.

Many teachers share materials and ideas to meet the diverse needs of all learners in their classrooms. Teachers can often rely on these sources to {{communicate with one another}} regarding any issues in education that they may be having, including classroom management techniques and policies. In this way, the blog often acts as a support system for teachers where they can access ideas, tools, and gain support and recognition from other professionals in their field. Weblogs can provide a forum for reading, writing and collaborating.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Edublogs</b> {{can be used}} as {{instructional}} resources, {{in which}} teachers can post tips, explanations or samples to help students learn. The use of blogs in the classroom allows both the teacher and student the ability to edit and add content at any time. The ability for both the teacher and student to edit content allows for study to take place outside the classroom environment,since blogs can usually be accessed using the URL of the blog on any computer. Blogs increase exposure to other students from around the country or world, while improving writing and communication skills. Teachers are using blogs as a way to post important information such as homework, important dates, missed lessons, projects, discussion boards, and other useful classroom information that is accessible by all.

Teacher Training and Education Faculty, Sebelas Maret University. Surakarta. 2011. The {{tenth grade}} {{students}} of SMA Negeri 1 Boyolali {{in the academic}} year 2010 / 2011 had problems dealing with writing skill. To overcome the problems, the researcher designed a classroom action research to teach writing using <b>Edublog.</b> This research aims {{to find out whether}} using <b>Edublog</b> can improve students’ writing skill and how using <b>Edublog</b> can improve the writing class of the tenth grade students of SMA Negeri 1 Boyolali in the academic year of 2010 / 2011. It is also aimed to find out {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} using <b>Edublog</b> in the writing class for the tenth grade students of SMA Negeri 1 Boyolali in the academic year of 2010 / 2011. This research was carried out in class X 1 of SMA Negeri 1 Boyolali in the academic year 2010 / 2011. It was conducted in two cycles in which in each cycle there were four meetings. Each cycle consisted of four steps: planning, action, observation and reflection. The data were in the form of qualitative and quantitative data. To collect the qualitative data, the researcher used observation, interviews, questionnaires, and photographs. To collect the quantitative data, the researcher conducted tests before and after implementation the actions. The tests were pre-test and post tests. To analyze the qualitative data, the researcher used Constant Comparative Method. There were four steps to analyze the qualitative data: (1) comparing data, (2) integrating categories, (3) delimiting the theory, and (4) writing the theory about the research findings. For the quantitative data, the researcher analyzed the mean scores of the tests. The result of the research shows that there are positive improvements in both students’ writing competence and the effectiveness of writing class during the teaching learning process. It could be seen from the result of the test which was improved, from the comparison between the pre-test conducted before the action and the post-test conducted after the action. The mean scores of the test result were 64. 9 for the pretest, 68. 9 for the post-test in cycle I, and 74. 7 for the post-test in cycle II. Using <b>Edublog</b> could be effective in teaching learning writing. Practically, there were some strengths and weaknesses of using <b>Edublog</b> at the tenth grade of SMA Negeri 1 Boyolali in the academic year 2010 / 201. The strengths were: firstly, using <b>Edublog</b> increases students’ motivation, enthusiasm and confidence in teaching learning process. Secondly, using <b>Edublog</b> helps the students have more spaces to practice writing in unlimited time and place. Thirdly, using <b>Edublog</b> provides the students a space to share opinions and ideas. Fourth, using <b>Edublog</b> can give learning possibilities to expand via collaboration, interaction and communication in the target language. Fifth, using <b>Edublog</b> is a place to carry out the students’ projects in writing class. Sixth, using <b>Edublog</b> is a chance to creatively control the students’ own blog or blog postings in an informal setting. Finally, using <b>Edublog</b> makes the students independent learners. On the other hands, in using <b>Edublog,</b> there were some problems. First, the teachers must be high quality professional teachers both in controlling the classroom and mastering materials and technology. Second, the technical problem in connection of internet probably occurs in the classroom. This activity requires excellent signal of school’s WIFI. Third, it needs the students to solve problems in an independent way. The students should have good knowledge in ICT and independent learners. And fourth, using <b>Edublog</b> in classroom needs high cost for supporting facilitations. Therefore, implementation of using <b>Edublog</b> should need more preparations between English teachers, students, and school for being success in the writing class...|$|E
2500|$|Many blogs provide {{commentary}} {{on a particular}} subject or topic, ranging from politics to sports. Others function as more personal online diaries, and others function more as online brand advertising of a particular individual or company.

The ability of readers to leave publicly viewable comments, and interact with other commenters, is {{an important contribution to}} the popularity of many blogs. However, blog owners or authors often moderate and filter online comments to remove hate speech or other offensive content. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (art blogs), photographs (photoblogs), videos (video blogs or [...] "vlogs"), music (MP3 blogs), and audio (podcasts).
