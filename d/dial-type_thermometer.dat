50|$|Mushikamado, or movable Kamado-style cookers are {{now made}} {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including high fire ceramics, refractory materials, double wall insulated steel, traditional terra cotta, and a mix of Portland cement and crushed lava rock. Outer surfaces also vary from a high gloss ceramic glaze, paint, a textured stucco-like surface and ceramic tiles. Modern ceramic and refractory materials decrease cracking - a common fault in the original Japanese design. Portland cement is still associated with cracking problems. In addition to the outer ceramic shell there is also a ceramic or stainless steel bowl inside the unit to hold charcoal. There is a draft opening in the lower side of the unit to provide air to the charcoal, as well as a controllable vent {{in the top of the}} dome lid for air to exit the cooker. Temperature is controlled by adjusting these two vents. One or more grids are suspended over the fire to provide the cooking surface(s) for the food. Finally, most Kamado-style cookers have a hole drilled in the lid to allow the insertion of the stem of a <b>dial-type</b> <b>thermometer</b> for monitoring the cooking temperature of the cooker. The high end kamados have layers of insulation which create low-airflow cooking conditions and are self-opening. Digital temperature control devices can be installed using a small blower to regulate airflow.|$|E
