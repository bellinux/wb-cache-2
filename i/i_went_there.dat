It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>there</b> alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E
500|$|According to Hughes, {{the scene}} at the Art Institute of Chicago was [...] "a self-indulgent scene of mine—which was a place of refuge for me, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>there</b> quite a bit, I loved it. I knew all the paintings, the {{building}}. This was a chance for me to go back into this building and show the paintings that were my favorite." [...] The museum had not been shot in, until the producers of the film approached them.

500|$|The song's {{composition}} begun after Strange Music label-mate ¡Mayday! sent Tech N9ne {{the song}} with their and Kendall Morgan's vocals on it. He said the introspective chorus made him {{take a moment}} to reflect on his own rhymes. He detailed himself creating his verse saying, [...] "After I wrote my verse, it was my second show in Seattle. We did two shows, because I sold out both shows. There was like 2,000 the first night, and another 2,000 on the second night. So it was like, 'Whoa, we sold out both shows!' I was already tired from the night before, and we already had booked the studio time in Seattle. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>there,</b> and I finished the last four bars of the verse I wrote. I wrote most of the verse—the first eight bars—on bus. It was getting closer to the show, and I wrote the last four bars at the studio because, our meet and greets aren’t an hour anymore. There’s like 300 people or 400 people, so you’re there until 6 pm now instead of 3 or 4. Now we got to go the studio, and I gotta be on stage at 9 pm, so it’s coming down to the wire I still have to eat and whatnot. But I did it, and after I did it, I’m like, 'Ooh, the verse is elite.'" ...|$|E

From a practical point of view, I needed to go make some money so I could keep my family going. It was costly for us to join the Apollo program. My salary was half what I was making in industry when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>there,</b> {{and it was just a}} strain to keep the family going and work going at the same time.

2500|$|Lansman {{was brought}} up in an Orthodox Jewish family in Southgate, north London. He was a pupil at the {{independent}} Highgate School from 1970 to 1975. [...] He first visited Israel when he was 16: [...] "I worked on a kibbutz in the Negev and my aunt lived in Beersheba. [...] It was actually a very politicising experience. When I did my bar mitzvah I saw myself as a Zionist and I think after <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>there</b> I felt it less. [...] I was more interested in the kibbutz and what I liked about it was the pioneering spirit, the sense of community and radicalism of it." ...|$|E

A Hells Angels member who {{identified himself as}} [...] "Pete, from Hells Angels San Francisco" [...] (most likely Pete Knell, president of the San Francisco chapter), says [...] "they offered us $500 worth of beer (to) go there {{and take care of}} the stage ... we took this $500 worth of beer to do it." [...] Sonny Barger, who also called into the KSAN forum, states: [...] "We were told by one of the (other Hells Angels) clubs if we showed up down there (and) sat on the stage and drink some beer ... that the Stones manager or somebody had bought for us." [...] In his lengthy call, Barger mentions the beer deal yet again: [...] "I ain't no cop, I ain't never going to ever pretend to be no cop. I didn't go there to police nothing, man. They told me if I could sit on the edge of the stage so nobody could climb over me, I could drink beer until the show was over. And that's what <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>there</b> to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Recording artist Prince {{played the}} guitar on three {{songs from the}} album, [...] "Like a Prayer", [...] "Keep It Together", and [...] "Act of Contrition", though he {{remained}} uncredited. [...] Prince and Madonna also worked together on the track [...] "Love Song". The song was recorded at Prince's Studio on Paisley Park; [...] "We were friends and talked about working together, so I went to Minneapolis to write some stuff with him, {{but the only thing}} I really dug was 'Love Song' [...] We ended up writing it long-distance, because I had to be in L.A. and he couldn't leave Minneapolis, and quite frankly I couldn't stand Minneapolis. When <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>there,</b> it was like 20 degrees below zero, and it was really desolate. I was miserable and I couldn't write or work under those circumstances", Madonna recalled. [...] For the artwork, the singer chose to work with photographer Herb Ritts. Initially, photos from the session with Ritts were also to be used for the lead single's packaging. For the photoshoot, she decided to dye her blonde hair brown; she commented [...] "I love blonde hair, but it really does something different to you. I feel more grounded when I have dark hair. It's unexplainable. I also feel more Italian when my hair is dark". The cover art features a close-up of the singer's jean-clad midsection and bare midriff. The cover has been seen as a reference to Sticky Fingers by The Rolling Stones. The packaging on the first pressings of the CD, cassette, and LP were scented with patchouli oils to simulate church incense. [...] A publicist for Warner Bros. Records revealed this had been the singer's idea; [...] "She wanted to create a flavor of the 60's and the church. She wanted to create a sensual feeling you could hear and smell". Initial pressings also included an insert with safe sex guidelines and a warning about the dangers of AIDS, to which Madonna had lost friends. Its inclusion was decided after Warner Bros. had agreed to release an album by stand-up comedian Sam Kinison the year before, although he had stated that AIDS came from gay men involved in bestiality. Madonna dedicated the album to [...] "My mother, who taught me how to pray".|$|E
