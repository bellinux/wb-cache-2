30|$|It {{is always}} a <b>forced</b> <b>fit</b> if one tries to find a certain {{historical}} data to mark a development which takes place over several tens or hundreds of years. There are some arguments to assign the birth of modern science {{to the work of}} Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, Frances Bacon, Isaac Newton (among others) (Schäfer 1999, p. 99; Störig 1992 [1950], p. 179). A number of societal, economic, and political developments, aetiologically relevant to the formation of modern science, happened in the sixteenth century in Europe (see Störig, p. 279). In the following, I will concentrate on developments which took place in the scientific realm and I will try to sketch the most important developments leading to the formation of modern science and their constituting elements.|$|E
40|$|The frequency-independent rms {{temperature}} fluctuations determined from the Cosmic Background Explorer-Differential Microwave Radiometer (COBE-DMR) two-year sky maps {{are used to}} infer the parameter Q(sub rms-PS), which characterizes the normalization of power-law models of primordial cosmological temperature anisotropy, for a <b>forced</b> <b>fit</b> to a scale-invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich (n = 1) spectral model. Using a joint analysis of the 7 deg and 10 deg 'cross'-rms derived from both the 53 and 90 GHz sky maps, we find Q(sub rms-PS) = 17. 0 (sub - 2. 1 sup + 2. 5) micro Kelvin when the low quadrupole is included, and Q(sub rms-PS) = 19. 4 (sub - 2. 1 sup + 2. 3) micro Kelvin excluding the quadrupole. These {{results are consistent with}} the n = 1 fits from more sensitive methods. The effect of the low quadrupole derived from the COBE-DMR data on the inferred Q(sub rms-PS) normalization is investigated. A bias to lower Q(sub rms-PS) is found when the quadrupole is included. The higher normalization for a forced n = 1 fit is then favored by the cross-rms technique...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{a model of}} black holes, galactic cores, and quasars evolving over time, rather than simply appearing shortly or immediately after the theoretical Big Bang. It should be noted galactic cores and quasars ‘are ’ black holes, given added definition by interaction with their surroundings. This model of evolving black holes {{does not support the}} Big Bang Theory, and suggests the concept of quasars popping into existence shortly after the theoretical Big Bang is a <b>forced</b> <b>fit,</b> lacking in any hard supporting evidence. Black Holes (Extreme Gravity) Black holes {{come in a variety of}} sizes. Small black holes are essentially undetectable, unless interacting with another star. It is theorized small, ‘invisible’ black holes are orbiting our own galactic core (a supermassive black hole) the same way star systems do. In 1917, Karl Schwarzschild calculated any star compressed past a certain critical radius would become so dense, and the gravitational force so great, the star would become a black hole. 1 This theory is now being given credit, and is called the ‘Schwarzschild radius. ’ The rounded, warped space above the black hole is called the ‘event horizon. ’ The event horizon marks the region surrounding the black hol...|$|E

40|$|The frequency-independent RMS {{temperature}} fluctuations determined from the COBE-DMR two year sky maps {{are used to}} infer the parameter Q_{rms-PS}, which characterizes the normalization of power law models of primordial cosmological temperature anisotropy. In particular, a 'cross'-RMS statistic is used to determine Q_{rms-PS} for a <b>forced</b> <b>fit</b> to a scale-invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich (n = 1) spectral model. Using a joint analysis of the 7 degree and 10 degree RMS temperature derived from both the 53 and 90 GHz sky maps, we find Q_{rms-PS} = 17. 0 ^{+ 2. 5 }_{- 2. 1 } uK when the low quadrupole is included, and Q_{rms-PS} = 19. 4 ^{+ 2. 3 }_{- 2. 1 } uK excluding the quadrupole. These {{results are consistent with}} the n = 1 fits from more sensitive methods (e. g. power spectrum, correlation function). The effect of the low quadrupole derived from the COBE-DMR data on the inferred Q_{rms-PS} normalization is investigated. A bias to lower Q_{rms-PS} is found when the quadrupole is included. The higher normalization for a forced n = 1 fit is then favored by the cross-RMS technique. As initially pointed out in Wright et al. (1994 a) and further discussed here, analytic formulae for the RMS sky {{temperature fluctuations}} will NOT provide the correct normalization amplitude.

Organizational embeddedness is the totality of <b>forces</b> (<b>fit,</b> links, and sacrifices) that keep people in their current organizations, while occupational embeddedness is the totality of <b>forces</b> (<b>fit,</b> links, and sacrifices) that keep people in their current occupations. The proposed framework identifies the antecedents of these parallel processes and when and why they can diverge. It also highlights the role that individuals' career stages play in the embedding process.
