5|$|The Shire is a British {{breed of}} <b>draught</b> <b>horse.</b> It is usually black, bay, or grey. It {{is a tall}} breed, and Shires have at various times held world records both for the largest horse and for the tallest horse. The Shire has a great {{capacity}} for weight-pulling, and has been popular throughout its history for pulling brewer's drays delivering ale to customers. The horses may {{also be used for}} forestry, for riding and for commercial promotion.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural and {{forestry}} work were the traditional {{uses of the}} Finnhorse. The Finnhorse was never bred to be a particularly large or heavy <b>draught</b> <b>horse,</b> {{as it was the}} only horse breed of the country, and versatility was desired as the Finnhorse was also used as the primary steed of the cavalry. The climate and conditions of Finland necessitated that the breed be durable and hardy. As a result, the Finnhorse remained small but tough, and could pull heavy loads in difficult terrain and even in chest-deep snow. Relative to its size, the Finnhorse is among the most powerful workhorses in the world with the best animals able to pull as much as 200percent of their own weight.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Clydesdale blood {{was added to}} the Irish draught breed in an attempt to improve and reinvigorate that declining breed. However, these efforts were not seen as successful, as Irish Draught breeders thought the Clydesdale blood made their horses coarser and prone to lower leg defaults. The Clydesdale was {{instrumental}} {{in the creation of the}} Gypsy Vanner horse, developed in Great Britain. The Clydesdale, along with other draught breeds, was also used to create the Australian <b>Draught</b> <b>Horse.</b> In the early 20th century, they were often crossed with Dales ponies, creating mid-sized draught horses useful for pulling commercial wagons and military artillery.|$|E

5|$|The Clydesdale is a {{breed of}} <b>draught</b> <b>horse</b> named for and {{derived from the}} farm horses of Clydesdale, a county in Scotland. Although {{originally}} {{one of the smaller}} breeds of draught horses, it is now a tall breed. Often bay in color, they show significant white markings due to the presence of sabino genetics. The breed was originally used for agriculture and haulage, and is still used for draught purposes today. The Budweiser Clydesdales {{are some of the most}} famous Clydesdales, and other members of the breed are used as drum horses by the British Household Cavalry. They have also been used to create and improve other breeds.|$|E
5|$|They {{have been}} patronized {{by members of}} the British Royal Family {{throughout}} their history, and they are still used to pull carriages in royal processions today. The breed has also been used to develop and improve several warmblood and <b>draught</b> <b>horse</b> breeds. Today they are used for farm work and driving, as well as under-saddle work. They are particularly popular for fox hunting and show jumping, both pure blooded and when crossed with Thoroughbreds. The Cleveland Bay is a rare breed, and both the United Kingdom-based Rare Breeds Survival Trust and the United States-based Livestock Conservancy consider the population to be at critical limits for extinction.|$|E

25|$|A single <b>draught</b> <b>horse</b> can {{normally}} pull a {{single-furrow plough}} in clean light soil, but in heavier soils two horses are needed, one {{walking on the}} land {{and one in the}} furrow. For ploughs with two or more furrows more than two horses are needed and, usually, one or more horses have to walk on the loose ploughed sod– and that makes hard going for them, and the horse treads the newly ploughed land down. It is usual to rest such horses every half-hour for about ten minutes.|$|E
25|$|The Friesian (also Frizian) is a horse breed {{originating}} in Friesland, in the Netherlands. Although the conformation of the breed {{resembles that of}} a light <b>draught</b> <b>horse,</b> Friesians are graceful and nimble for their size. It is believed that during the Middle Ages, ancestors of Friesian horses were in great demand as war horses throughout continental Europe. Through the Early Middle Ages and High Middle Ages, their size enabled them to carry a knight in armour. In the Late Middle Ages, heavier, draught type animals were needed. Though the breed nearly became extinct {{on more than one}} occasion, the modern day Friesian horse is growing in numbers and popularity, used both in harness and under saddle. Most recently, the breed is being introduced to the field of dressage.|$|E

500|$|The Welsh Cob existed {{as a type}} {{as early}} as the Middle Ages, and {{mentions}} of such animals can be found in medieval Welsh literature. During this time, they were known for their speed, jumping ability, and carrying capacity. Before the introduction of large, [...] "coldblood" [...] <b>draught</b> <b>horse</b> breeds, they were used for farm work and timbering. In 1485 the Welsh Militia, riding local animals presumed to be ancestors of the modern Welsh Cob, assisted Henry Tudor in gaining the English throne.

500|$|Horses {{were not}} the only equids used to support human warfare. Donkeys have been used as pack animals from antiquity to the present. Mules were also {{commonly}} used, especially as pack animals and to pull wagons, but also occasionally for riding. Because mules are often both calmer and hardier than horses, they were particularly useful for strenuous support tasks, such as hauling supplies over difficult terrain. However, under gunfire, they were less cooperative than horses, so were generally not used to haul artillery on battlefields. [...] The size of a mule and work to which it was put depended largely on the breeding of the mare that produced the mule. Mules could be lightweight, medium weight, or even, when produced from <b>draught</b> <b>horse</b> mares, of moderate heavy weight.|$|E
500|$|For farm work, such as {{ploughing}} and harrowing, the <b>draught</b> <b>horse</b> {{utilized for}} this purpose was called an affrus (or stott), which was usually smaller and cheaper than the cart horse. [...] While oxen were traditionally used as work animals on farms, horses began {{to be used in}} greater numbers after the development of the horse collar. [...] Oxen and horses were sometimes harnessed together. [...] The transition from oxen to horses for farm work was documented in pictorial sources (for example, the 11th-century Bayeux tapestry depicts working horses), and also clear from the change from the Roman two-field crop-rotation system to a new three-field system, which increased the cultivation of fodder crops (predominantly oats, barley and beans). [...] Horses were also used to process crops; they were used to turn the wheels in mills (such as corn mills), and transport crops to market. The change to horse-drawn teams also meant a change in ploughs, as horses were more suited to a wheeled plough, unlike oxen.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of the First World War, the Suffolk Punch had become a popular work horse on large farms in East Anglia due to its good {{temperament}} and excellent work ethic. It remained popular until the Second World War, when a combination of the need for increased wartime food production (which resulted in many horses being sent to the slaughterhouse), and increased farm mechanisation which followed the war decimated population numbers. Only nine foals were registered with the Suffolk Horse Society in 1966, but there has been a revival of interest in the breed since the late 1960s and numbers have risen continuously. The breed did remain rare, and in 1998 there were only 80 breeding mares in Britain, producing around 40 foals per year. [...] In the United States, the American Suffolk Horse Association became inactive after the war and remained so for 15years, but restarted in May 1961 as the <b>draught</b> <b>horse</b> market began to recover. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the American registry allowed some Belgians to be bred to Suffolk Punches, but only the fillies from these crosses were permitted registry with the American Suffolk Horse Association.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In Belgian <b>draught</b> <b>horses,</b> {{disability}} and disfigurement {{of the lower}} limbs has been present for decades. Only in 2003 the term chronic progressive lymphoedema (CPL) was assigned to this devastating disorder, which is most practically diagnosed by clinical research. A veterinary scoring system (CPL score) has been created to define CPL condition of the limbs in <b>draught</b> <b>horses.</b> Other factors that have been related to CPL prevalence (skin condition, weight, age and sex) could confirm assigned scores and subsequently improve CPL diagnosis. Therefore, {{the relationship between the}} occurrence of CPL and these different phenotypic characteristics was investigated. Additionally, as a measure of skin condition, skinfold thickness was studied. Methods and results: Data are based on clinical veterinary inspections at official horse meetings (14) and farm visits (27) in Belgium (October 2009 -Februari 2011), covering 856 horses. Skinfold thickness was measured with a Harpenden skinfold caliper. Statistical analysis was performed using a general linear model, including age, sex, body weight, height at withers and skinfold thickness. Consistent with previous studies, mares show lower mean CPL scores compared to stallions (1. 98 and 2. 21 respectively, on a scale from 1 = no CPL to 5 = extreme CPL). An analogous sex difference can be observed for skinfold thickness (means respectively 5. 3 cm and 7. 8 cm). There is a significant sex dependent relationship between CPL scores and age (P< 0. 001) : males tend to develop clinical symptoms faster than females. Also skinfold thickness and CPL scores are significantly related (P= 0. 0026). Body weight and height at withers could not be related to CPL scores (n= 76 individuals). Conclusions: CPL in Belgian <b>draught</b> <b>horses</b> is related to skinfold thickness and affected by sex and age. Skinfold thickness measurements of <b>draught</b> <b>horses</b> could confirm CPL diagnosis in the field. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Serum protein {{electrophoresis}} is {{a useful}} screening test in equine laboratory medicine. The method can provide valuable information about changes in the concentrations of albumin and alpha-, beta-, and gamma-globulins and thereby help characterize dysproteinemias in equine patients. Reference values for horses using agarose gel as a support medium have not been reported. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study}} was to establish reference intervals for serum protein concentrations in adult horses using agarose gel electrophoresis and to assess differences between warm-blooded and heavy <b>draught</b> <b>horses.</b> In addition, the precision of electrophoresis for determining fraction percentages and the detection limit were determined. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 126 clinically healthy horses, including 105 Thoroughbreds and 21 heavy <b>draught</b> <b>horses</b> of both sexes and ranging from 2 to 20 years of age. The total protein concentration was determined by an automated biuret method. Serum protein electrophoresis was performed using a semi-automated agarose gel electrophoresis system. Coefficients of variation (CVs) were calculated for within-run and within-assay precision. Data from warm-blooded and <b>draught</b> <b>horses</b> were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Within-run and within-assay CVs were < 5 % for all protein fractions. No significant difference was found between warm-blooded and heavy <b>draught</b> <b>horses</b> and so combined reference intervals (2. 5 - 97. 5 %) were calculated for total protein (51. 0 - 72. 0 g/L), albumin (29. 6 - 38. 5 g/L), alpha(1) -globulin (1. 9 - 3. 1 g/L), alpha(2) -globulin (5. 3 - 8. 7 g/L), beta(1) -globulin (2. 8 - 7. 3 g/L), beta(2) -globulin (2. 2 - 6. 0 g/L), and gamma-globulin (5. 8 - 12. 7 g/L) concentrations, and albumin/globulin ratio (0. 93 - 1. 65). Conclusion: Using agarose gel as the supporting matrix for serum protein electrophoresis in horses resulted in excellent resolution and accurate results that facilitated standardization into 6 protein fractions...|$|R
