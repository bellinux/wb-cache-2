5000|$|The {{basic concept}} is rather unconventional: {{the car is}} driven by a central [...] "power module", {{also known as a}} [...] "powerpack" [...] or a [...] "drive container", powered on both axles. Two light <b>end</b> <b>modules,</b> each with a bogie, rest on the power module, which {{produces}} useful traction weight on the driving axles. The <b>end</b> <b>modules</b> also use the space very effectively, although the railcar is divided into two halves by the power module. Most units have a path through the drive container for passenger access. The <b>end</b> <b>modules</b> can be delivered with standard pulling devices or buffer gears, or with central buffer couplings. They are built with a low-floor design except above the bogies and at the supported ends (more than 65% of the railcar is low-floor). All of the usual comforts to be expected in a modern local network railcar are provided, such as air conditioning, a multi-purpose room, vacuum toilets (in a washroom suitable for the disabled) and a passenger information system. The GTWs can be Diesel-electric or electric-powered (via overhead wires or third rail).|$|R

40|$|Distributed {{embedded}} systems have become larger, {{more complex and}} complicated. More often, such systems operate accordingly to the IoT or Industry 4. 0 concept. However, large number of <b>end</b> <b>modules</b> operating in the system leads to a significant load and consequently, to an overload of the communication interfaces.

Nevertheless, basic version of the protocol does not protect against the system failure in the event of failure of one of the nodes. This paper proposes four novel variants of the CloudBus protocol, which allow the fault detection. The comparison and performance analysis was executed for all proposed CloudBus variants. The verification and behavior analysis of the distributed systems were performed on SoC hardware research platform. Furthermore, a simple test application was proposed...|$|R

40|$|The Low Frequency Instrument {{on board}} the PLANCK {{satellite}} is designed to give the most accurate map ever of the CMB anisotropy of the whole sky over a broad frequency band spanning 27 to 77 GHz. It is made of an array of 22 pseudo-correlation radiometers, composed of 11 actively cooled (20 K) Front <b>End</b> <b>Modules</b> (FEMs), and 11 Back <b>End</b> <b>Modules</b> (BEMs) at 300 K, each FEM and BEM set comprising two radiometers. The {{connection between the two}} parts is made with rectangular Wave Guides (WGs). Considerations of very different na-ture (thermal, electromagnetic and mechanical), imposed stringent requirements on the WGs characteristics and drove their design. From the thermal point of view, the WG should guarantee good insulation between the FEM and the BEM sections to avoid overloading the cryocooler. On the other hand it is essential that the signals do not undergo excessive attenuation through the WG. Finally, given the different positions of the FEM modules behind the focal surface and the mechanical constraints given by the surrounding structures, different mechanical designs were necessary. A composite configuration of Stainless Steel and Copper was selected to satisfy all the requirements described. Given the complex shape and the considerable length (about 1. 5 - 2 m) of the LFI WGs, manufacturing and testing the WGs was a challenge. This work deals with the development of the 1 a...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{numerical}} {{study to}} investigate the effects of passenger vehicle front <b>end</b> <b>module</b> on engine cooling system performance has been conducted. Since the front <b>end</b> <b>module</b> has {{a direct impact on}} vehicle drag and vehicle cooling performance, it {{plays an important role in}} vehicle design. The current study investigates the effects of grill area, horn blockage, condenser, and fan capacity on engine cooling performance. A 1 -dimensional CFD modeling methodology is used with different sub-systems such as coolant, engine oil circuit, intercooler, condenser and other components such as thermostats, radiators, fans and pump etc. using GT-SUITE. A pre-processing tool called COOL 3 D which is part of GT-SUITE is used to build the 3 D underhood of vehicles using a component-by-component build approach, and therefore allowing inclusion of much more details than a usual 1 D simulation model. GT-SUITE object-based code helps us to build reliable cooling systems and optimize the front <b>end</b> <b>module</b> for various operating conditions and reduces our effort on real time testing. With above considerations and methodologies we significantly improved the engine cooling performance...|$|E
