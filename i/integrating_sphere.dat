40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the imaging quality of a visible imaging system by measuring the minimum resolvable contrast (MRC), a novel MRC measurement method is proposed to judge the test patterns at different spatial frequencies and contrasts so that the right pattern can be identified using a computer instead of human eyes. A MRC measurement system with two <b>integrating</b> <b>spheres</b> is therefore developed. The two <b>integrating</b> <b>spheres</b> {{can be used to}} illuminate either side of the target and the contrasts of patterns on the target can be changed by controlling the special attenuators near the entrances of the two <b>integrating</b> <b>spheres.</b> During the judgment human visual properties to the luminance and frequency are considered, the computer can therefore simulate human eyes better. Experimental results indicate that the errors of measuring the luminance can be controlled within r 0. 3 cd/m 2, which offers a guaranteed precision for the measurement of MRC. The MRC values at all the frequencies are less than those by observers. The measurement of MRC is not influenced by human subjective factors. This method can be used to measure the MRC of a visible imaging system more accurately and helps to realize the automatic measurement of MRC...|$|R
40|$|The radiometric {{calibration}} of imaging spectrometers {{is usually}} performed using <b>integrating</b> <b>spheres</b> as light sources. Their homogeneities are usually defined for the entrance aperture. As airborne hyperspectral sensors {{are focused on}} infinity, the calibration of such sensors is done {{in a way which}} is not well defined. In this paper, a method is shown which allows the characterization of <b>integrating</b> <b>spheres</b> with a radiometrically uncalibrated hyperspectral sensor. The sphere is characterized {{in the same way as}} it is used for the calibration of hyperspectral sensors. This allows the determination of the relative uncertainty of radiometric measurements due to inhomogeneities. Also, the relative radiometric response of the sensor can be derived at the same time. The method is demonstrated exemplarily with a HySpex VNIR- 1600, an airborne imaging spectrometer system from Norsk Elektro Optikks A/S (NEO) ...|$|R

50|$|Integrating spheres {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} optical, {{photometric}} or radiometric measurements. They are used to measure the total light radiated in all directions from a lamp. An <b>integrating</b> <b>sphere</b> can be used to measure the diffuse reflectance of surfaces, providing an average over all angles of illumination and observation. An <b>integrating</b> <b>sphere</b> can be used to create a light source with apparent intensity uniform over all positions within its circular aperture, and independent of direction except for the cosine function inherent to ideally diffuse radiating surfaces (Lambertian surfaces).|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the effects of random laser speckle and self-mixing {{interference}} on TDLS based gas measurements made using <b>integrating</b> <b>spheres.</b> Details of the theory and TDLS apparatus are given in Part 1 of this paper and applied here to <b>integrating</b> <b>spheres.</b> Experiments have been performed using two commercial <b>integrating</b> <b>spheres</b> with diameters of 50 mm and 100 mm {{for the detection of}} methane at 1651 nm. We have calculated the expected levels of laser speckle related uncertainty, considered to be the fundamental limiting noise, and imaged subjective laser speckle in a sphere using different sized apertures. For wavelength modulation spectroscopy, noise equivalent absorbances (NEAs) of around 5 × 10 - 5 were demonstrated in both cases, corresponding to limits of detection of 1. 2 ppm methane and 0. 4 ppm methane respectively. Longer-term drift was found to be at an NEA of 4 × 10 - 4. This lies within our broad range of expectations. For a direct spectral scan with no wavelength dither, a limit of detection of 75 ppm or fractional measured power uncertainty of 310 - 3 corresponded well with our prediction for the objective speckle uncertainty.

50|$|An {{important}} {{requirement for}} the coating material {{is the absence of}} fluorescence. Fluorescent materials absorb short-wavelength light and re-emit light at longer wavelengths.

50|$|The {{practical}} {{implementation of the}} <b>integrating</b> <b>sphere</b> was due to work by R. Ulbricht (1849-1923), published in 1900.

50|$|The {{front-end}} optics of a spectroradiometer {{includes the}} lenses, diffusers, and filters that modify the light as it first enters the system.

50|$|An <b>integrating</b> <b>sphere</b> (also {{known as}} an Ulbricht sphere) is an optical {{component}} consisting of a hollow spherical cavity with its interior covered with a diffuse white reflective coating, with small holes for entrance and exit ports. Its relevant property is a uniform scattering or diffusing effect. Light rays incident on any point on the inner surface are, by multiple scattering reflections, distributed equally to all other points. The effects of the original direction of light are minimized. An <b>integrating</b> <b>sphere</b> may {{be thought of as}} a diffuser which preserves power but destroys spatial information. It is typically used with some light source and a detector for optical power measurement. A similar device is the focusing or Coblentz sphere, which differs in that it has a mirror-like (specular) inner surface rather than a diffuse inner surface.Although the sphere system is used for infrared spectral measurements, the measurement method, design principles, and features are generally applicable to other wavelengths as well.|$|E
50|$|Monochromatic light {{allows for}} the {{measurement}} of the quantum efficiency (QE) of an imaging device (e.g. CCD or CMOS imager). Light from the exit slit is passed either through diffusers or an <b>integrating</b> <b>sphere</b> on to the imaging device while a calibrated detector simultaneously measures the light. Coordination of the imager, calibrated detector, and monochromator allows one to calculate the carriers (electrons or holes) generated for a photon of a given wavelength, QE.|$|E
