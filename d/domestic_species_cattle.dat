Preservation of the bones was, on the whole, quite good, although some variability was noted within the assemblage from Context 4005. Much of the assemblage was composed of the usual <b>domestic</b> <b>species,</b> <b>cattle,</b> caprovids and pigs. Fish remains were identified from Sample 1 (Context 1004).

40|$|A {{series of}} {{sediment}} samples and two boxes of hand-col 1 ected bone, from deposits of 11 th to 14 th century date, revealed by excavations at Wakeman’s House, Ripon, North Yorkshire, were submitted for {{an evaluation of}} their bioarchaeological potential. The few biological remains, other than bone, recovered from the samples were of no interpretative value beyond that given in the text. A small, but well dated assemblage of bones was recovered from the excavations. The bulk of the vertebrate remains, mainly identified as the major <b>domestic</b> <b>species,</b> <b>cattle,</b> caprovids and pigs, were recovered from 11 th/ 12 th century deposits. Skeletal element representation for cattle and caprovids from these deposits suggested the presence of both primary butchery waste and domestic refuse. A squirrel metatarsal may suggest the inclusion of waste from specialist craft activities. Additionally, remains of a sparrowhawk may provide evidence for high status activities such as hawking and hunting. No further investigation of the biological remains (other than bone, and the?charred amorphous organic component of Context 1018) from the sediment samples, is warranted. However, any remaining sediment should be sieved for the recovery of small bones and this material considered in conjunction with any additional study of the hand-collected vertebrate assemblage.

30|$|In Argentina, one endemic {{medium-sized}} deer (Hippocamelus bisulcus Molina, commonly {{named as}} huemul) {{is the most}} endangered species of Patagonia (Black-Decima et al. 2016), being the flag species for several conservation programs (Flueck and Smith-Flueck 2006; Smith-Flueck et al. 2011; Vidal et al. 2011). Some authors sustain that this species presented a marked decrease in its geographical distribution due {{to a combination of}} several factors, e.g., habitat loss, trade-offs with <b>domestic</b> <b>species</b> (<b>cattle</b> or dogs), poaching, malnutrition, and infectious disease (Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000; López-Alfaro et al. 2012; Corti et al. 2011, 2013). Several conservation efforts in Southern Patagonia had been conducted without clear knowledge about species habitat requirement and/or the effectiveness of the current natural reserve network (National and Provincial reserves) (Frid 2001; Vila et al. 2006; Luque et al. 2011; Martínez Pastur et al. 2016).The objective {{of this study was to}} elaborate a potential HSM for huemul in Santa Cruz province (Argentina). Additionally, we want to answer the following questions: (i) which are the main environmental requirements for huemul? (ii) is the potential habitat suitability area coincident with the current distribution of the species? and (iii) where are the suitable distribution areas in the natural reserve network? With these questions, we want to understand the huemul ecological requirements and to know if the species actually occupy the entire potential habitat along its historical distribution according to archeological and historical references. We also want to characterize the protection status of the species considering the conservation strategy of the National and Provincial Governments.|$|E

40|$|The broad aim of {{this thesis}} is to further {{understanding}} of British Iron Age animal husbandry regimes by undertaking a comparative study of faunal assemblages. More specifically, this involves development of a uniform methodology for comparing published faunal data in order to recognise inter and intra-regional patterns of animal husbandry. Lack of uniformity in methods of recording and presenting faunal data, together with variation in {{the quality and quantity}} of information published in reports, serves as a barrier to systematic quantitative comparison. This thesis therefore seeks to develop methods of comparison which utilise the most commonly available forms of faunal data, or convert different forms of data into a single comparable format, in order that inter and intra-regional analyses of the widest possible dataset can be undertaken. To ensure viable comparisons unaffected by small sample bias, only those sites with total cattle, sheep and pig assemblages of NISP> 300 or MNI> 30 are included in this study. Analyses concentrate on the three main <b>domestic</b> <b>species</b> (<b>cattle,</b> sheep, and pig) which comprise the bulk of all faunal remains recovered from excavations of British Iron Age sites, and utilise three main types of information: Firstly, representation of different skeletal elements is examined in order to recognise the effects of taphonomic and human alteration on each assemblage. Secondly, quantification data for cattle, sheep, and pig is compared, using tripolar graphs to establish the relative importance of different species in each assemblage. Thirdly, mandibular tooth wear data is used for the composition of mortality profiles to compare herd management strategies. Both species proportions and mortality profiles from different faunal assemblages are compared, and examined for any inter and intra-regional similarities. Subsequently assemblages are examined for relationships between patterns of species proportions and/or mortality profiles and particular site characteristics (topographical location, underlying geology, settlement type, and date). Finally, using the results of these analyses, suggestions are made as to the nature of animal husbandry regimes in different regions, and the factors influencing choice of husbandry strategy in Iron Age Britain...|$|E
40|$|Relationships among 25 dog breeds, {{classified}} {{a priori}} by their respective ancestral trunks, were studied {{using data from}} 29 morphological and 13 behavioral characteristics. Although a certain correlation was found between both types of traits (r = 0. 13; P < 0. 05), this relationship was not manifested, regarding the level of racial classification, in the obtained dendrograms. The relationships between breeds obtained from morphological data were more congruent than those obtained from behavioral data when compared with phylogenies from other sources of information (mainly electrophoretic analysis). This indicates that the morphological characters could give more and better complementary information than the behavioral ones in {{the reconstruction of the}} phylogenetic relationships of canids. The mean character difference (MCD), used as a measure of taxonomic resemblance between breeds, had a value of 0. 53 (± 0. 12 STD), and was of a magnitude very similar to that obtained in other <b>domestic</b> animal <b>species</b> (<b>cattle,</b> horse, sheep and goats), indicating that a similar degree of morphological differences between breeds of these species exists...|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{in other}} <b>domestic</b> animal <b>species</b> like <b>cattle,</b> {{reproductive}} biotechnologies like Artificial Insemination (AI) and Embryo Transfer (ET) {{are not well}} developed and thus are not being used as routine breeding procedures in camels. One of the important objectives of this manuscript {{is to focus on}} analyzing the present status of Multiple Ovulation and Embryo Transfer (MOET) in camels and its future perspectives. Camels are induced ovulators, thus require hormonal treatment to induce ovulation and control the follicular cycles, which is the main reason why protocols used in other <b>domestic</b> animal <b>species</b> cannot be directly used in this species. The review suggests that the best method for super stimulation of ovaries in camels is use of a combination of Equine Chorionic Gonadotropin (eCG) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) at any stage after elimination of dominant follicle if any or at the early stage of the follicular wave and ovulation of the developed multiple follicles can be achieved by mating donors.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the prevalence of Coxiella burnetii in two <b>domestic</b> ruminant <b>species</b> (<b>cattle</b> and sheep) and the western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus) in Western Australia (WA). The IDEXX CHEKiT Q Fever ELISA and CFT were used to test sera from 50 sheep and 329 head of cattle for anti- C. burnetii antibodies and 343 kangaroo sera were tested using an indirect ELISA developed specifically for this study. Faecal or urine samples collected from the same animals were tested with two PCR assays to identify active shedding of C. burnetii in excreta. Only two of the 379 ruminant sera had detectable levels of anti- C. burnetii antibodies according to the ELISA while the CFT did not detect any positive samples. In contrast 115 of the 343 western grey kangaroo serum samples were positive when tested with the antibody-ELISA. The first qPCR assay, targeting the IS 1111 a element, identified 41 of 379 ruminant and 42 of 343 kangaroo DNA samples as positive for C. burnetii DNA. The second qPCR, targeting the JB 153 - 3 gene, identified nine C. burnetii DNA-positive ruminant samples and six positive kangaroo samples. Sequence comparisons showed high degrees of identity with C. burnetii. Isolation of C. burnetii from faeces was also attempted but was not successful. From the results presented here it appears that domestic ruminants may not be the most significant reservoir of C. burnetii in WA and that kangaroos may pose a significant threat for zoonotic transfer of this pathogen...|$|R
40|$|One {{hundred and}} {{fourteen}} strains of Pasteurella multocida were isolated from different <b>domestic</b> animals <b>species</b> (<b>cattle,</b> buffalo, sheep, goat, pig, rabbit, dog, cat), avian species (chicken, duck, turkey) and wild animals (deer, tiger, orang utan, marmoset). The serogroups of P multocida {{were determined by}} both conventional capsular serotyping and a multiplex PCR assay targeting specific capsular genes. Based on the conventional serotyping method, the 114 strains of P multocida were subtyped into 55 species-specific (untypeable strains) P. multocida, 15 serogroup A, 23 serogroup B and 21 serogroup D. Based on the multiplex PCR assay on the specific capsular genes associated with each serogroup, the 114 strains were further divided to 22 species-specific P. multocida (KMT 1 - 460 bp), 53 serogroup A (A - 1, 044 bp), 33 serogroup B (B - 760 bp) and 6 serogroup D (D - 657 bp). No serogroup E (511 bp) or F (851 bp) was detected among the Malaysian P. multocida. PCR-based typing was more discriminative and could further subtype the previously untypeable strains. Overall, {{there was a significant}} and positive correlation between both methods in serogrouping P. multocida, (r = 0. 7935; p < 0. 4893). Various serogroups of P. multocida were present among the livestock with 75 of the strains belonging to serogroups A or B. PCR serotyping was therefore a highly species-specific, sensitive and robust method for detection and differentiation of P multocida serogroups compared to conventional serotyping. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report from Malaysia of the application of a PCR to rapidly define the species-specific P. multocida and its serogroups as an important zoonotic pathogen in Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|The forestomach {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the digestion physiology of ruminants. The aim of this study is to clarify the morpho-functional role of the mucosa in each of the three compartments of the forestomach in three <b>domestic</b> ruminants <b>species,</b> viz <b>cattle,</b> buffalo and sheep, by means of structural, histochemical and immunocytochemical methods, including transmission electron microscopy, light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. These methods were chosen to demonstrate the indirect evidence for the presence of nitric oxide (NO) employing NADPHd and nitric oxide synthase I (NOS I). The various cell layers of the forestomach epithelium are described and illustrated in detail. An intense NADPHd staining was observed in the granulosa, spinosa and basal layers of the epithelium, in particular in the cytoplasm over the nucleus. NOS I immunoreactivity was found in all specimens of the forestomach mucosa. The results of this study might reflect a possible role of NO in delaying the onset of cellular apoptosis in the forestomach mucosa of the domestic ruminants, by playing a role in the production of cell energy...|$|R
40|$|Contents During {{the last}} decades, in vitro {{fertilization}} (IVF) has become a routine technique in most domestic animals. However, in the dog the technique has lagged behind, with to date not a single pup born after IVF. In cats, healthy kittens have been born, but in fewer numbers than in cattle and horses. In pet animals, research in reproduction has mainly been focused on contraception, although recently, {{the introduction of new}} drugs especially marketed for cats and dogs will probably expand fertility research in carnivores towards the previously neglected area of assisted reproduction. In particular, the dog remains a real challenge for the reproductive biologist, due to the low meiotic capacity of canine follicular oocytes. In cats, oocyte maturation is less of a problem and embryo production rates comparable to those of cattle can be achieved. The domestic cat is a valuable model for endangered felids and it can even be used as a recipient for wild felid embryos. In this short review, we list some of the problems associated with the implementation of IVF in dogs and cats in relation to their reproductive characteristics, and we discuss the state-of-the-art of IVF in several other <b>domestic</b> <b>species</b> such as <b>cattle,</b> horses and pigs...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of farming landscapes in the Thames Valley from the Neolithic to the Roman period (4000 BCE â 410 CE). The focus is on the major <b>domestic</b> animal <b>species,</b> <b>cattle,</b> sheep and pig, and their roles in the agroecosystem, traced using carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios measured in collagen. The large dataset of faunal isotope values from a limited area, obtained from sites with extensive archaeological and environmental information, allowed a thorough characterisation of variability in isotope values, within and between species, sites, archaeological periods, and landscape regions. Isotope ratios in a flock of modern sheep showed less variability than archaeological assemblages. Linear mixed models were used to analyse variation in isotope values in 1490 archaeological samples from 23 sites. The pattern of change over time differed for cattle, sheep and pig, reflecting both wide-scale environmental change and changes in animal management. δ 13 C values of cattle and pigs reflected the loss of primary closed-canopy woodland. Pig management changed from an emphasis on woodland resources to a closer association with settlement and consumption of anthropogenic waste. Herbivore δ 15 N values probably reflect variations in the intensity of pasture use and association with arable farming. Climatic cooling since the post-glacial thermal maximum cannot explain these varied trajectories of change. Variation between sites in faunal isotope values was related to landscape regions. Faunal isotope values at individual sites were useful in site interpretation in the context of other evidence. The trend in pig and cattle δ 13 C values with time was widely found in the UK, as expected if it represents forest clearance. In the Neolithic, cattle management was similar to the UK at central and eastern European Neolithic sites, but pig management was different. Patterns of faunal isotope values and their changes over time, analysed in the context of archaeological and environmental information, can contribute to the interpretation of sites, and give a unique perspective on changes in farming practice and their effects on the landscape. </p...|$|R

A study to see the effects of concentration of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (Folltropin) on the ovulation rates and twinning birth was conducted. The experiment designed was commpletely randomized designed with 3 treatment of total concentration of FSH (A: 12, B: 6 and C 3 ml) and 4 lactating cows for a replications. Hormon was intramussculary injected in decreasing dossis method twice a day with 12 hours apart for 4 days. Data recorded were the diameter of ovary (DO), total corpus luteum (TCL), concentration of progesterone on the day 12 of estrus cycle (P), percentage of pregnancy and number of birth. FSH significantly increased the ovulation rates. The means DO was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher after injection (6. 3 cm) than those before injection (2. 0 cm). The TCL and P were highly significant (P < 0. 01) higher after injection. The TCL and P were 1. 2 and 0. 8 ng/ml and 8. 5 and 3. 0 ng/ml before and after hormone treatment respectively.
