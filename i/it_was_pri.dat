40|$|Call two-faced map and, specifically, (p; q) -map a 3 -valent map (on sphere or torus) {{with only}} p- and q-gonal faces (at least one each), for given {{integers}} 3 · p < q; so, 3 · p · 5. Two-faced maps (especially, (5; 6) -polyhedra, called fullerenes) are prominent molecular models in Chemistry. We {{say that a}} (p; q) -map <b>is</b> <b>pRi</b> if any p-gon has the same number i of p-gonal neighbors; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> qRj if each q-gon has the same number j of q-gonal neighbors. Call a (p; q) -map strictly face-regular if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> both, <b>pRi</b> and qRj, for some i,j; call it weakly face-regular, if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> only <b>pRi</b> or qRj. All strictly face-regular (p; q) -polyhedra are ([BrDe 99], [De 02]) Prismm, Barrelm (m ¸ 3) and 55 sporadic polyhedra. By Barrelm we denote 4 m-vertex (5; m) -polyhedron, consisting of two m-gons separated by two m-rings of 5 -gons. All 23 parameter-sets (p; q; i; j) for strictly face-regular (p; q) -tori are found ([De 02]); the number of minimal tori is one for 7 of them and an infinity for 16 others. Here we address the characterization of all weakly face-regular (p; q) -maps on sphere or torus. Examples of obtained results are: 1. Any (3; q) -map, which is 3 R 0, has 4 · q · 12. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> strongly face-regular for q = 4; 5 (Prism 3 and Barrel 3 only) and q = 11; 12 (only tori, unique for q = 12). All such weakly face-regular maps are infinities of polyhedra and tori for each 7 · q · 10 and (characterized) in¯nity of (3; 6) -polyhedra. 2. Weakly face-regular (5; q) -polyhedra 5 Rj exist for j = 3; 6 · q · 10, and j = 2; q ¸ 8. 3. The following general conjecture: the number of (p; q) -polyhedra, which are qRj, is in¯nite if and only the corresponding torus exist. 4. If a (p; q) -polyhedron is qRj, then j · 5.

50|$|The {{settlement}} was named Dobrova until 1998, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> renamed Dobrova <b>pri</b> Prihovi (literally, 'Dobrova near Prihova') to differentiate it from other settlements {{with the same}} name. The name Dobrova is shared with several other places in Slovenia and is derived from Common Slavic *dǫbrova 'place {{where there is a}} deciduous or oak forest', in turn derived from *dǫbъ 'deciduous tree, oak'. Like similar names (e.g., Dobrovce, Dobrovnik, Zadobrova), it originally referred to the local vegetation.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Weather {{derivatives}} {{are different}} from most other derivatives in that the underlying weather cannot be traded. Furthermore, the weather derivatives market is relatively illiquid. This means that weather derivatives cannot be cost-efficiently replicated with other weather derivatives, ie, for most locations the bid [...] ask spread is too large to make it economical to hedge a position. One {{of the consequences of}} this is that valuation of weather derivatives is closer to insurance pricing than to derivatives pricing (arbitrage pricing). For this reason <b>it</b> <b>is</b> important to base valuation on reliable historical data, {{and to be able to}} model the underlying indexes accurately. In the future, the weather derivatives market may become more liquid, and at that point <b>it</b> may <b>be</b> possible to use other weather derivatives for hedging and thereby derive prices from the market for at least some contracts. However, the main purpose of this chapter is to review how weather derivatives <b>are</b> <b>pri...</b>|$|R
