500|$|... "Goldilocks and the Three Bears" [...] and {{the older}} still [...] "The Story of the Three Bears" [...] are two {{variations}} of a 19th-century fairy tale. The original tale tells of a badly-behaved old woman who enters the forest home of three bachelor bears whilst they are away. She sits <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>chairs,</b> eats some of their porridge, and sleeps {{in one of their}} beds. When the bears return and discover her, she starts up, jumps from the window, and is never seen again. The other major version brings Goldilocks to the tale (replacing the old woman), and an even later version retained Goldilocks, but has the three bachelor bears transformed into Papa, Mama, and Baby Bear.|$|E
500|$|In 1894, [...] "Scrapefoot", a tale with a fox as {{antagonist}} {{that bears}} striking similarities to Southey's story, was uncovered by the folklorist Joseph Jacobs and may predate Southey's version {{in the oral}} tradition. [...] Some sources state that it was illustrator John D. Batten who in 1894 reported {{a variant of the}} tale at least 40 years old. [...] In this version, the three bears live in a castle in the woods and are visited by a fox called Scrapefoot who drinks their milk, sits <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>chairs,</b> and rests in their beds. [...] This version belongs to the early Fox and Bear tale-cycle. [...] Southey possibly heard [...] "Scrapefoot", and confused its [...] "vixen" [...] with a synonym for an unpleasant malicious old woman. [...] Some maintain however that the story as well as the old woman originated with Southey.|$|E
500|$|The story makes {{extensive}} use of the literary rule of three, featuring three chairs, three bowls of porridge, three beds, and the three title characters {{who live in the}} house. There are also three sequences of the bears discovering in turn that someone has been eating from their porridge, sitting <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>chairs,</b> and finally, lying in their beds, at which point is the climax of Goldilocks being discovered. This follows three earlier sequences of Goldilocks trying the bowls of porridge, chairs, and beds successively, each time finding the third [...] "just right". Author Christopher Booker characterizes this as the [...] "dialectical three", where [...] "the first is wrong in one way, the second in another or opposite way, and only the third, in the middle, is just right." [...] Booker continues [...] "This idea that the way forward lies in finding an exact middle path between opposites is of extraordinary importance in storytelling". This concept has spread across many other disciplines, particularly developmental psychology, biology, economics and engineering where it is called the [...] "Goldilocks Principle".|$|E

Flex was mainly used as a filler heel character but got over with the crowd by his outlandish antics and because he included the crowd into the show by having them do certain exercises and then yelling at them to sit back down <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>chair</b> and that they will never look like him.|$|R

5000|$|The setup in {{the first}} season was very basic. All three contestants were seated in front of {{breakaway}} sections in the wall behind them. Upon elimination, the losing contestant was simply pulled <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>chair</b> through that section of the wall, which would fall backwards allowing the chair to continue sliding behind the stage. Upon being pulled through, a black curtain was dropped concealing the contestant. Most of the time this was accompanied by the camera shaking violently and a [...] "static" [...] effect to simulate the TV (and the contestant, as mentioned by Ober) going [...] "Off the Air." [...] On occasion, the chair would return through the wall with the contestant replaced by a skeleton or something else indicating {{that he or she}} had been [...] "killed." ...|$|R

2500|$|Of {{his time}} as an NSA analyst, {{directing}} the work of others, Snowden recalled a moment {{when he and his}} colleagues began to have severe ethical doubts. Snowden said 18 to 22-year-old analysts were suddenly [...] "thrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility, where they now have access to all your private records. In the course of their daily work, they stumble across something that is completely unrelated in any sort of necessary sense—for example, an intimate nude photo of someone in a sexually compromising situation. But they're extremely attractive. So what do they do? They turn around <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>chair</b> and they show a co-worker ... and sooner or later this person's whole life has been seen by all of these other people." [...] As Snowden observed it, this behavior happened routinely every two months but was never reported, being considered one of the [...] "fringe benefits" [...] of the work.|$|R

40|$|It finally {{occurred}} to me that there is a treatment plan for depression implied in my article on depression (Psychiatry 2001; it is available as # 12 and 12 a [4 commentaries] on my website.) This paper was based on my notes on 70 intake interviews of older working class males in an English mental hospital in 1965. They all presented as obviously depressed <b>in</b> <b>their</b> speech and manner. But there was a moment in some of the interviews that seemed like a miracle to me. The psychiatrist asked 41 of the patients about their activity during WWII. For a majority of those asked this question, their responses shocked and surprised me. As they began to describe their activities during the war, their behavior and appearance changed. They sat up <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>chair,</b> raised <b>their</b> voice to a normal level or close to it, held their head up and looked directly at the psychiatrist, usually {{for the first time in}} the interview. The speed of their speech picked up, often to a normal rate, and became clear and coherent, virtually free of pauses and speech static.
