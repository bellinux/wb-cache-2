Reitman had fueled {{speculation}} {{that he would}} give a sneak preview at that festival. He posted pictures from Telluride on his Twitter account. Prior to the first showing, people waited two <b>hours</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into Up in the Air and hundreds were turned away.|$|E
5|$|On {{the weekend}} of August17–18, 2009, another serious traffic jam occurred, in which it took some drivers two <b>hours</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the Thruway from the mall. Officials cited several factors: the heavy traffic on Route17 that weekend for both the 40th anniversary of the Woodstock Music Festival in Sullivan County and the observances of the anniversary of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum's death in Kiryas Joel, a few miles to the west. A traffic light that had been {{malfunctioning}} after a recent lightning strike may also have contributed.|$|E

5|$|York {{has been}} a major railway centre since the first line arrived in 1839 at the {{beginning}} of the railway age. For many years the city hosted the headquarters and works of the North Eastern Railway. York railway station is a principal stop on the East Coast Main Line from London to Newcastle and Edinburgh. It takes less than two <b>hours</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to York from London by rail, with at least 25 direct trains each weekday. The station is also served by long distance trains on CrossCountry services linking Edinburgh and Newcastle with destinations in south and west England via Birmingham. TransPennine Express provide a frequent service of semi-fast trains linking York to Newcastle, Scarborough, Leeds, Manchester, Manchester Airport, and Liverpool. Local stopping services by Northern connect York to Selby, Harrogate, Hull, Leeds, Sheffield and many intermediate points, as well as many other stations across Greater Manchester and Lancashire.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} to Battle Mountain and P'il-bong {{was much more}} difficult from the east, the American-held side, than from the west, the North Korean side. On the east side there was no road climbing halfway to the top; {{from the base of}} the mountain at the edge of the Haman valley the only way to make the ascent was by foot trail. Climbers took two to three hours to reach the top of P'il-bong from the reservoir area, and required from three to four <b>hours</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on top of Battle Mountain from the valley floor. The turnaround time for supply trains to Battle Mountain was six hours. Often a dispatch runner required eight hours to go up Battle Mountain and come back down. In some places the trail was so steep that climbers had to set up ropes to hold along the side of the trail. North Korean night patrols constantly cut telephone lines. The wire men had a difficult and dangerous job trying to maintain wire communication with units on the mountain. Food, water and ammunition were frequently short for the units at the tops of the peaks.|$|E
5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took <b>hours</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E

25|$|Tracklaying was {{completed}} in 1866, having started at each end and joined in the middle. The line was tested with a locomotive from Ilkley, which took nearly two <b>hours</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> from Keighley to Oxenhope, but just 13 minutes to get back. Before opening, violent storms struck the line in November of that year.|$|E

25|$|Colonel DeLand {{tried to}} impose {{discipline}} on the disorderly camp but was frustrated by its poor condition and corrupt guards, including especially those {{from his own}} regiment. Because only two water hydrants were available to the prisoners, they had {{to wait in the}} cold for <b>hours</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> water. Open sinks (latrines), or sewers, ran through the middle of the camp. The rundown buildings provided inadequate shelter. Hospital capacity, with 120 beds for prisoners and 50 beds for guards, was seriously inadequate. The post chapel was converted into hospital space, but there was still insufficient capacity for all the sick prisoners and guards.|$|E
25|$|The {{restaurant}} {{opened on}} April 28, 1993, {{in the former}} location of Burhop's Seafood on LaSalle Street in Chicago. Guests at the grand opening included Illinois governor Jim Edgar, Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley, actor Mickey Rooney, and comedian Jackie Mason. During {{the first few months}} of operation, the restaurant received up to 1,500 visitors and 7,000 telephone calls each day. Many waited several <b>hours</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a table, since the restaurant did not take dinner reservations. Michael Jordan's remained a popular tourist attraction throughout the 1990s and became a major gathering spot for Chicago Bulls fans during the team's championship runs.|$|E

25|$|The 2003 pick-ups were {{filmed in}} the Wellington studio car park, with {{many parts of}} sets and blue-screens used to finish off scenes, which the design team had to work 24 <b>hours</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the right sets ready for a {{particular}} day. The shoot continued for two months, and became an emotional time of farewells for the cast and crew. The film has the most extensive list of re-shoots given for the trilogy. Jackson took his time to re-shoot Aragorn's coronation, rushed into a single day under second unit director Geoff Murphy on 21 December 2000. Jackson also re-shot scenes in and around Mount Doom, and Théoden's death, right after Bernard Hill was meant to wrap.|$|E
25|$|Early reoccupied Marye's Heights on {{the morning}} of May 4, cutting Sedgwick off from the town. However, McLaws was {{reluctant}} to take any action. Before noon, Lee arrived with Anderson's division, giving him a total of 21,000 men, slightly outnumbering Sedgwick. Despite Lee's presence, McLaws continued his passive role and Anderson's men took a few <b>hours</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into position, a situation that frustrated and angered both Early and Lee, who had been planning on a concentrated assault from three directions. The attack finally began around 6 p.m. Two of Early's brigades (under Brig. Gens. Harry T. Hays and Robert F. Hoke) pushed back Sedgwick's left-center across the Plank Road, but Anderson's effort was a slight one and McLaws once again contributed nothing. Throughout the day on May 4, Hooker provided no assistance or useful guidance to Sedgwick, and Sedgwick thought about little else than protecting his line of retreat.|$|E
