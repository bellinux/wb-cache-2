Meanwhile, the effect of valley shape on the stress of <b>face</b> <b>slab</b> is considered. The results show that the maximum deflection and axial stress are located near the bottom of <b>face</b> <b>slab</b> in the central valley area before earthquake. And there are compressive stresses in mostly area of <b>face</b> <b>slab.</b> After earthquake, the positions of maximum deflection and axial stress of <b>face</b> <b>slab</b> were changed to the crest of the central valley area. As the valley aspect ratio increases, compressive stress of <b>face</b> <b>slab</b> decreases. For the 300 m ultra-high CFRD, the maximum axial stresses exceed the concrete compressive strength before and after earthquake. Therefore, the compression damage of <b>face</b> <b>slab</b> should be considered during the design...|$|R

Through the analysis of two selected calculation cases of cold wave, it is shown that the calculated cracking direction and cracking zone caused by thermal stress {{are similar to those of}} the observed cracks.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the numerical performance of three contact simulation methods, namely, the interface element, thin-layer element, and contact analysis methods, through the analysis of the contact behavior between the concrete <b>face</b> <b>slab</b> and the dam body of a high concrete-faced rockfill dam named Tianshengqiao-I in China. To investigate the accuracy and limitations of each method, the simulation results are compared in terms of the dam deformation, contact stress along the interface, stresses in the concrete <b>face</b> <b>slab,</b> and separation of the concrete <b>face</b> <b>slab</b> from the cushion layer. In particular, the predicted dam deformation and slab separation are compared with the in-situ observation data to classify these methods according to their agreement with the in-situ observations. It is revealed that the interface element and thin-layer element methods have their limitations in predicting contact stress, slab separation, and stresses in the concrete <b>face</b> <b>slab</b> if a large slip occurs. The contact analysis method seems to be the best choice whether the separation is finite or not...|$|R

40|$|Chinas {{economy is}} growing rapidly and this creates an {{enormous}} demand for energy. China’s government has over the years constructed many hydropower stations to meet some of this demand. A crucial part of a hydropower station is the reservoir, {{in order to create}} one a dam is needed. With the reservoir the hydropower station can store and produce electricity on demand. The concrete face rockfill dam (CFRD) is a dam type that consists of a concrete slab that lies on the upstream slope of an embankment. The Concrete face works as an impervious layer. The slab is supported by the rockfill embankment, which is constructed in different zones with different purposes and features. CFRD has been accepted in China because of the safety and also for economic reasons. The CFRD has been constructed at numerous places in China, the dam type is under continuous development at the China Institute of Water resources and Hydropower Research (IWHR). As the development of CFRD continues the height of these dams increases. There is one CFRD in China that is in the planning stage right now which will have a total height of 257 meters and in the future China plans to build dams with heights over 300 meter. There have been several high CFRDs that have had failure due to rupture in the <b>face</b> <b>slab.</b> Movement in the embankment causes larger stresses in the <b>face</b> <b>slab.</b> If these stresses increase enough it will lead to spalling failure in the <b>face</b> <b>slab.</b> The rupture will then significantly escalate the seepage through the dam body. These problems have come as a surprise as it were not foreseen by either numerical modeling or empiric design methods. IWHR conducts research on the problem with rupture in the slab of high CFRD, this master thesis is a small part of that work. In this study two numerical analyses with the finite element method (FEM) have been conducted. The first analysis tries to answer how stresses and deformations change with an increased height of the dam. The second analysis models the performance of the dam when stiffness is decreased in one of the rockfill zones in the dam. When the dam height is increased the deformations in the cross-valley direction magnifies, these will cause larger compression stresses {{in the center of the}} slab. Since the stresses in the cross-valley direction increase faster than the confining water pressure there is an enhanced risk of rupture in the <b>face</b> <b>slab.</b> When the stiffness modulus of the downstream rockfill zone, referred to as zone 3 C, is decreased the result will be an increased deflection of the concrete slabs upper part. The stresses in the cross-valley direction do not enlarge with lower stiffness of zone 3 C. Therefore the risk of rupture in the slab will not increase.

40|$|China {{has a huge}} need {{of energy}} and to meet this demand the {{government}} invest in hydropower. Large hydropower plants are both constructed and planned. The dams will continuously be constructed larger and higher. A dam type that has demonstrated decent performance is the Concrete Face Rockfill Dam (CFRD), {{both in terms of}} safety and costs. Very high CFRD´s, up to 300 meters, are subjected to large stresses in the <b>face</b> <b>slab,</b> which can cause leakage. It can be hard and costly to repair due to large water depths. To approach a solution, China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research (IWHR) have start developing a new type of dam. It is a combination of a CFRD and a Concrete Gravity Dam (CGD). This dam type will reduce the length of the <b>face</b> <b>slab,</b> and thus decrease the stresses, and enable maintenance work through a gallery in the CGD. A dam prototype with a height of 150 meters, Yang Qu dam, will be built in the Yellow River. The goal with this prototype is, besides energy production, to develop the technique and in the future build this new type of dam to the height of 300 meters or more. The critical area is the transition zone between the CFRD and CGD. To minimize the displacements in this zone hardfill will be used. This material consists of gravel and sand mixed with cement, which reduces the compressibility compared to ordinary rockfill. Yang Qu is analysed in three cases with different distributions of the hardfill material. This is performed by numerical modelling based on the finite element method. Each case is varied with three different values of the Young´s modulus of the hardfill. The maximum allowable displacement perpendicular to the slope of the <b>face</b> <b>slab</b> in the transition zone is 5 cm. Without hardfill the displacement reaches 7. 7 cm. All three investigated cases give a displacement under 5 cm. One case shows the best results with the least consumption of cemented fill. It consists of hardfill placed in the same slope as the concrete dam with a width of 50 m (in cross section). Maximum total settlement of the dam body is also being investigated. The maximum allowed settlement is 1. 5 % of the dam height. All cases including the case without hardfill provides a maximum settlement far below this allowed value.

The Lagrangian approach was used with fluid elements to model impounded water. The interface elements were used to simulate the slippage between the concrete <b>face</b> <b>slab</b> and the rockfill. The horizontal component of the 1992 Erzincan earthquake, with a peak ground acceleration of 0. 515 g, was considered in time-history analysis. The Drucker-Prager model was preferred in nonlinear {{analysis of the}} concrete slab, rockfill and foundation soil. The maximum principal stresses and the maximum displacements in two opposite directions were compared by {{the height of the}} concrete slab according to linear time-history analysis to reveal the effect of reservoir water. The changes of critical displacements and principal stresses with time are also shown in this paper. According to linear and nonlinear time-history analysis, the effect of the reservoir water on the earthquake performance of the Torul CFR Dam was investigated and the possible damage situation was examined. The results show that the hydrodynamic pressure of reservoir water leads to an increase in the maximum displacements and principal stresses of the dam and reduces the earthquake performance of the dam. Although the linear time-history analysis demonstrates that the earthquake causes a momentous damage to the concrete slab of the Torul CFR Dam, the nonlinear time-history analysis shows that no evident damage occurs in either reservoir case...|$|R
