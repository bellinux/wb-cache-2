40|$|The {{rights and}} the realities Cue: Water supply {{projects}} are sometimes accused of ignoring the water needs of rural communities in favour of supplying industry and urban areas. And while a country may include a right to water in its constitution, in reality many poor people have a daily struggle to access water for their most basic needs: washing, drinking and cooking. The United Nations Development Programme is working in Kenya to improve the access of the rural population to safe water. Ann Mikia spoke to Mr. Situma Mwichibe, the National Coordinator of the Africa 2000 network to find out his views {{on the rights of}} the rural poor to water. IN:		?I?m talking to Mr Situma Mwichebe, he?s? OUT:		?and as such there is self regulation? DUR?N	 2 ? 50 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr. Situma Mwichebe talking to Ann Mikia about the reality of water rights in Kenya. Transcript Mikia	I?m talking to Mr Situma Mwichebe, he?s the National Co-ordinator of the Africa 2000 Network, a programme of the United Nations Development Programme. Mr Mwichebe, would you say Kenyans have rights to water? Mwichebe	I would say yes they have rights in the sense that the right to access to water is entrenched in the Kenyan constitution, but whether they have equitable access to water is a different story. Some people have access to water; others normally don?t have equitable access to water. But their right is there. Mikia	So would you say the poor are discriminated against as far as access to water is concerned? Mwichebe	I would not say that the poor are deliberately discriminated against. Maybe discrimination comes about in that the poor hardly ever can afford a water project. Mikia	What would you say about the government projects? Do you think they take their communities? needs into account in placing their projects? Mwichebe	Most government projects are targeting larger community interests other than household or small community interests. They are designed to spur economic growth. They are supplying water to municipalities, they are supplying water to industries and as such sometimes they do not take the needs of the local people in consideration. But there are also other smaller water schemes by the government which actually do address their community needs. So where you have large giant water projects they tend to address national interests but where you have medium and long term small projects, spring protection, they hopefully do address community needs. Mikia	What about irrigation, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> are free to do irrigation if they wish to? Mwichebe	Whether every Kenyan has a right to irrigation, I think in principle, yes, but there are certain standards that you have to meet and as such you have to go through the political control mechanisms of government which sometimes people perceive to be restrictive. In general any Kenyan can irrigate but there are some community water schemes where the volume of water available is limited. The communities themselves restrict irrigation because they want first of all to meet the household domestic needs first and if you went into irrigation it means out of the six thousand households probably only two hundred would do that, and as such there is self regulation. End of tape. Mr. Situma Mwichebe talking to Ann Mikia about the reality of water rights in Kenya...|$|E
40|$|Getting regular foods Cue: For any farmer, the {{quantity}} of what they produce and how well it?s stored will determine their food ? and income ? for the year. Production and storage is even more critical for farmers with HIV/AIDS. Weakened by illness, they need crops and farming methods that don?t {{require a lot of}} effort as well as effective storage to make sure they have good food all year round. Dodou Jallow ? who works for the Gambian Network of AIDS Support Societies ? is well aware of these challenges and talked with Ismaila Senghore about what farmers can do. IN:	?As most of the support? OUT:	?our forefathers were doing. ? DUR?N:	 3 ? 28 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: From Gambia that was Dodou Jallow. What traditional methods of storage can you tell us about? The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Jallow	As most of the support group members are rural farmers. That means we have to create income-generating activities from farming for them to be self sufficient. Ismaila	What kind of crops <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> with HIV/AIDS can farm because they are usually people that lack energy, so maybe they would need to be advised on crops that are easy to grow and that are of course of high nutritive value. Jallow	We are very weak, so what type of farming we recommend to them is fruit tree farming, whereby you have a garden, after fencing the garden you have some fruit trees which if you plant them you don?t need to water them. Some drought tolerant trees like cashews, like mangoes, and so on, just have a fence, {{at the beginning of the}} rainy season you plant them and then just taking care you don?t need to water them. Ismaila	There are many ways of ensuring that food supplies are constant and regular throughout the year, that is by processing, preservation and storage of some of the perishable foods that maybe out of season. Do you think there is the possibility for your people to learn the skills that will help them ensure that later there will be a constant supply? Jallow	That is a very good question. I know that most of our yields became low due to poor storage facilities. So by processing, drying of these fruits like mangoes, you can process it and dry it so that it can stay for a long time. Ismaila	We know there are also some grains and other kinds of vegetables that may be easier to store than others. Do you have any choice about what kind of fruits and grains that you may envisage to store? Jallow	When you say grains really you have grains which are highly nutritious like maize, they are fast growing, high yielding and with proper care, with proper drying, they can store for a longer time. With just drying them at adequate moisture temperature you can store them. Ismaila	Now talking about storage, what kind of storage facilities would you recommend - the design? Jallow	Normally when the seed storage there is for the whole entire village, and we see what belongs to all belongs to nobody. So the type of storage facilities we would like to build is a sensible store that will be able to take care of our goods, and then we know that the store is for us and we will take care of it. Ismaila	Now how would a store be managed because you know there are possibilities of pest infestation. What kind of preservatives would you recommend for them to use? Jallow	With the local system that we were doing, our farmers have been preserving by using wood ash, even these neem trees and so on. We can do it and we will be able to preserve our commodities as long as we wish. Things that you know that they will be having so much pungent smell to drive insects out. You clean the store very well, and then let the commodity be dried well before you store it, let it have adequate temperature immediately before you store it and then you can use these local preservation methods that our forefathers were doing.

40|$|Soya - a {{rich source}} of protein, oil and income Cue: Soya beans are best known for being rich in two {{important}} foodstuffs: oil and protein. Much of the world?s cooking oil is derived from soya, and most of this is grown in the United States, Brazil, China and Argentina. Soya beans, also called soybeans, are widely eaten as a vegetable in East Asia, where the plant originates from, but less so {{in other parts of the}} world. One reason may be that the beans need a long period of soaking and cooking to make them edible. However, because of its high protein content, soya is an excellent food, particularly for those who cannot eat meat - whether for reasons of cost or because they are vegetarian. In Malawi, soya beans are used as an ingredient in phala, a nutritious porridge widely fed to babies. Mrs Linley Banda grows soya on her farm in Thyolo district, in southern Malawi. Patrick Mphaka went to visit her there, to find out more about this nutritious food and cash crop. IN:		?Yes it is easy to grow soya beans? OUT:		? I have benefited from the crop. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 20 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mrs Linley Banda from Thyolo in Malawi was talking to Patrick Mphaka. Transcript Banda	Yes it is easy to grow soya beans compared to other cash crops. But it also has its own problems. The advantage of growing soya crops is that it does not require too many inputs compared to maize. The problems are that it is attacked by some pests and diseases and sometimes it is destroyed when the rains are prolonged. Mphaka	So you do not need a lot of rains for soya beans? Banda	The rains are required but not too much. Mphaka	On the two hectares on which you have planted your soya beans this year, how many bags do you think you will realise from there? Banda	As you have seen, this year we did not have enough rains. I am sure I will get about sixty bags of soya from this garden because last year I had about ninety 50 kg bags of soya. Mphaka	Can we talk about money, how much is that? Banda	(Laughter) I am sure you are good at maths, you can calculate. Mphaka	Do you just harvest it and take it to the market or just harvest it and have people come and buy? How do you do it with soya beans? Banda	After harvesting the soya beans, we thresh it and winnow it. And thereafter, we check if there are some stones and some immature seed. After that we pack it in bags and it is ready for sale. Mphaka	Do you put it in different grades or do you just sell it as one grade? Banda	It is good to put it in grades so that you can fetch good price. I put in grades. Mphaka	Tell me about the market. Banda	There is a very good established market for soya. There is Rab Processors which is buying soya from us farmers. Transglobe is also buying soya from us. Other NGOs do fetch some seeds from us to give to other farmers so that they can start growing this crop. Mphaka	So why do you sell it to the local market? Banda	I sell to the local market because some farmers just come to my house to buy for their house use. So I cannot refuse to sell to them. Mphaka	What do you think is the reason that not many farmers around here are growing soya beans, when given your experience, it is a very profitable crop? Banda	The problem is that many farmers do not realize the importance of soya beans and the way to process and utilize it. They feel it is difficult to grow the soya beans. Mphaka	<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> are used to eating soya or maybe they think that it is something which they do not know about as evidenced by their not growing it in large numbers? Banda	As of now, I can say people are now learning the goodness of eating soya. Many farmers around this area are now coming to buy the crop for their house use. Through the radio and hospitals where the under-five children are going for scales, they are told to feed their children phala (porridge) with soya. Mphaka	Given the two years that you have been growing it, are there any people who are showing interest to start to grow soya beans? Banda	Yes there are so many that this year, around this area more farmers have now started planting this crop because they have seen what I have benefited from the crop. End of track. Linley Banda grows soya beans on her farm in southern Malawi. She likes the crop because it needs less inputs than maize. She sells most of her soya beans to food processors...|$|E

40|$|The {{emotional}} impact of carrier detection for CF was assessed {{in a group}} of adults tested before 1992. Of the 200 adults who received a mailed questionnaire, 70 % participated. One third were CF gene carriers. The Health Orientation Scale (HOS) was used to evaluate perceived feelings about three situations: (a) How would you describe your feelings about yourself when you consider your test result? (b) How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> most <b>people</b> feel when they are told that they carry the CF gene? (c) How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> most <b>people</b> feel when they are told that they do not carry the CF gene? Comparing the profiles of CF carriers and non-carriers, we found that carriers had significantly less positive feelings about themselves than non-carriers. Carriers as well as non-carriers attribute significantly more negative feelings to most carriers of the CF gene than to most non-carriers. Moreover, carriers of the Cf gene attribute more negative feelings to other CF carriers than to themselves. Analysis of variance revealed a significant effect of carrier status on self-description, as well as a significant effect of carrier status and degree of kinship with a CF patient on feelings attributed to most carriers. Although these results suggest some danger of stigmatization of CF carriers, the cognitive bias of 'illusory superiority' seems to counterbalance some of its effects. status: publishe...|$|R
