5|$|Historically, California Zinfandel vines {{were planted}} {{as a field}} blend {{interspersed}} with Durif (Petite Sirah), Carignan, Grenache, Mourvèdre, Mission and Muscat. While most vineyards are now fully segregated, California winemakers continue to use other grapes (particularly Petite Sirah) in their Zinfandel wines. Zinfandel <b>is</b> <b>grown</b> on approximately 11% of California's vineyard land area. Around 400,000 short tons (350,000 tonnes) are crushed each year, depending on the harvest, placing Zinfandel third behind Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon and just ahead of Merlot.|$|E

5|$|Like {{some other}} psychoactive {{grassland}} {{species such as}} Psilocybe semilanceata, Conocybe cyanopus, P.tampanensis can form sclerotia–a hardened mass of mycelia that is more resistant to adverse environmental conditions than normal mycelia. This truffle-like form gives the fungus some protection from wildfires and other natural disasters. Other Psilocybe species known to produce sclerotia include Psilocybe mexicana and Psilocybe caerulescens. Sclerotia are also produced when the species <b>is</b> <b>grown</b> in culture.|$|E
5|$|Maraba coffee <b>is</b> <b>grown</b> in {{the south}} of Rwanda at {{coordinates}} , roughly 12kilometres (7mi) from Butare and 150kilometres (93mi) from the capital, Kigali. The project began in the Maraba District of Butare Province, but these entities were replaced under local government organisation in 2006, and the area is now part of Huye District in the Southern Province. The area is very hilly, due to its proximity to the Western Rift Valley and the montane Nyungwe Forest, and features rich volcanic soils. The coffee <b>is</b> <b>grown</b> at altitudes between 1,700 and 2,100 metres (5,577–6,889ft) above sea level, often on steep hillsides with terrace farming. The area experiences an average of 115centimetres (45in) of rainfall annually. The majority of this falls during the rainy season of March to May, the major coffee harvesting season. The high altitude lowers the temperature slightly to an average of about 20 °C (68 °F). There is little seasonal variation.|$|E
5|$|Sycamores {{make new}} growth from the stump or roots if cut down and can {{therefore}} be coppiced to produce poles {{and other types of}} small timber. Its coppice stools grow comparatively rapidly, reaching up to 10feet in diameter in 450 years. It <b>is</b> <b>grown</b> as a species for medium to large bonsai in many areas of Europe where some fine specimens can be found.|$|E
50|$|From a gardener's perspective, a plant's {{status as}} annual, biennial, or {{perennial}} often varies based on location or purpose. Biennials grown for flowers, fruits, or seeds need to <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> for two years. Biennials that <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> for edible leaves or roots <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> {{for just one}} year (and not grown on a second year to run to seed).|$|R
25|$|Kiwifruit can <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> in most {{temperate}} climates {{with adequate}} summer heat. Where fuzzy kiwifruit (A. deliciosa) is not hardy, other species can <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> as substitutes.|$|R
50|$|It can <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> in {{southern}} UK, in damp or wet soils. They can also <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> {{in most of}} the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.|$|R
5|$|The {{plant is}} {{fairly easy to}} grow in a {{mediterranean}} climate with good drainage and a light (sandy) soil; however, with medium to high susceptibility to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, it is unreliable in conditions that favour {{the growth of the}} soil-borne water mould, such as summer humidity or poor drainage. The use of phosphite fungicides does reduce the spread of Phytophthora. It generally does poorly in eastern Australia, although it <b>is</b> <b>grown</b> commercially in southeastern South Australia as a cut flower crop. It is also grown in California and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The {{triploid}} {{onion is}} a hybrid species with {{three sets of}} chromosomes, two sets from A. cepa and the third set from an unknown parent. Various clones of the triploid onion are grown locally in different regions, such as 'Ljutika' in Croatia, and 'Pran', 'Poonch', and 'Srinagar' in the India-Kashmir region. 'Pran' <b>is</b> <b>grown</b> extensively in the northern Indian provinces of Jammu and Kashmir. There are very small genetic differences between 'Pran' and the Croatian clone 'Ljutika', implying a monophyletic origin for this species.|$|E
5|$|Vanilla <b>is</b> <b>grown</b> {{on small}} patches of land {{both as a}} single crop {{as well as an}} inter crop. As it needs lot of water for growth, it is largely grown on the rainier {{windward}} side of the island. Initially, vanilla is planted next to small trees until its vines grow to some height, at which point it is cut down closer to the soil so that it spreads across the ground. It starts to flower when about three years old; the flowering period is from July to August.|$|E
50|$|The warm-season cereals <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> in {{tropical}} lowlands year-round and in temperate climates during the frost-free season. Rice <b>is</b> commonly <b>grown</b> in flooded fields, though some strains <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> on dry land. Other warm climate cereals, such as sorghum, are adapted to arid conditions.|$|R
50|$|The {{species may}} <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> in shade or sun, and is {{somewhat}} drought tolerant though it performs best in moist situations. It can withstand light to moderate frosts and prefers a sandy loam {{although it may}} <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> in rocky or clay-based soils. It may also <b>be</b> <b>grown</b> as a container plant in standard potting mix. Plants may be propagated by division.|$|R

5|$|Zinfandel <b>is</b> <b>grown</b> {{across the}} {{continental}} United States, although California grows the largest proportion. U.S. producers make wine in styles {{that range from}} late harvest dessert wines, rosés (White Zinfandel) and Beaujolais-style light reds to big hearty reds and fortified wine {{in the style of}} port. The quality and character of American Zinfandel wines largely depend on the climate, location, and age of the vineyard in which they are grown, as well as the technology employed by the winemaker.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} station {{was established to}} grow sugar at Mongalla in the 1950s, and there were plans to establish commercial operations. However, after independence in 1956 the Khartoum government shifted the sugar project to the north, where it <b>is</b> <b>grown</b> under much less favorable conditions with heavy irrigation. A sugar, clothing, and a weaving factory was established in Mongalla in the 1970s but operations failed to get beyond their trial phase and diminished as conflict grew in {{the region in the}} early 1980s. In April 2006 the President of Southern Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, named Mongalla as one of the Nile ports {{to be the first to}} be rehabilitated.|$|E
5|$|Banksia spinulosa var.spinulosa was {{introduced}} into cultivation in the United Kingdom in 1788 by Joseph Banks who supplied seed to Kew, Cambridge Botanic Gardens and Woburn Abbey among others; var.collina followed in 1800 and var.cunninghamii in 1822. It has proven a highly ornamental and bird-attracting plant in cultivation. Southern and montane provenance forms are frost hardy. In general, all forms prefer sandy, well-drained soils with sunny aspect, though some local forms hailing from Wianamatta shales may tolerate heavier soils. It is resistant to dieback, like most eastern banksias. As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia spinulosa is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as chlorosis, it manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins, and {{occurs when the}} plant <b>is</b> <b>grown</b> in soils of higher pH. This can also happen where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations, and can be treated with iron chelate or sulfate.|$|E
50|$|Genetically {{modified}} cotton, canola, and carnations <b>are</b> <b>grown</b> in Australia. Genetically modified cotton has <b>been</b> <b>grown</b> commercially in New South Wales and Queensland since 1996.
