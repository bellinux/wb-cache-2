40|$|Abstract Various {{forms of}} lumbar {{instability}} require a surgical stabi-lization. As {{an alternative to}} fusion, a mobile, dynamic stabilization re-stricting segmental motion would be advantageous in various indications, allowing greater physiological func-tion and reducing the inherent disad-vantages of rigid instrumentation and fusion. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>neutralization</b> system for the spine (Dynesys) is a pedicle screw system for mobile sta-bilization, consisting of titanium al-loy screws connected by an elastic synthetic compound, controlling mo...|$|E
40|$|The {{records of}} 68 {{patients}} (42 men and 26 women) who undetwent spine stabilization with a <b>dynamic</b> <b>neutralization</b> system were reviewed. Mean patient age at operation was 42. 8 years. The primary indication for surgery was degenerative spine disease and instability with neurogenic or radicular pain andlor chronic back pain. Forty-one (60. 2 %) patients had degenerative diskopathy or disk herniation, and 27 (39. 8 %) patients had lumbar spine stenosis. One-motion segment spine stabilization {{was performed in}} 30 patients, 2 -motion segment spine stabilization in 32 patients, and 3 -motion segment spine stabilization in 6 patients. W~thin a mean follow-up of 36. 2 months (range, 12. 9 - 75. 3 months), there were 2 re-operations, and 3 patients with screw loosening. Re-operations were for a deep infection in 1 patient and left leg pain in another patient. Both patients were managed with early implant removal and spinal arthrodesis. Self-assessment questionnaires showed improvement of patients ' clinical and functional status. The Oswestry Disability Index and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire score improved from a mean preoperative score of 55. 4 % (severe disability) and 52 % respectively to a mean postoperative score of 22. 9 % (moderate disability) and 35 % respectively. The overall {{results of this study}} are highly comparable to fusion procedures. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>neutralization</b> system can be a safe and effective alternative technique to spine arthrodesis in selected cases of degenerative lumbar spine instability. An arthrodesed spine is not a normal state. When lumbar spine segments are fused together, either as a congenita...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The <b>dynamic</b> <b>neutralization</b> system (Dynesis) {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{for the treatment of}} symptomatic lumbar discopathy. This system preserves the mobility of the instrumented vertebral segment and restores discal height by posterior distraction on pedicular screws, stabilization being ensured by compression on a spacer. The potential kyphosing effect of this system and the impact on sagittal morphology of the spine were analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients were studied. Lateral x-rays of the lumbar spine in the upright position were obtained before and after the surgical procedure and at mean 9. 5 +/- 3. 3 months follow-up. Comparisons were made between the pre- and postoperative presentation with measurement of the pelvic and spinal sagittal parameters described by Duval-Beaupère: inclination of the pelvic segment on the sacrum, lordosis, and disc wedge angles at each level (particularly the instrumented levels). Sagittal morphology was assessed pre- and postoperatively. RESULTS: Mean kyphosing effect was 6 +/- 1. 4 degrees, induced by the posterior distraction system. This accentuated the initial lumbar hypolordosis related to the degenerative disease. Comparison of the pre- and postoperative films revealed four types of sagittal reaction of the lumbopelvic segment: no modification (type A), significant loss of lordosis without change at the pelvis level (type B) or with compensatory pelvic retroversion (type C), accentuation of the lordosis with pelvic anteversion (type D). CONCLUSION: The <b>dynamic</b> <b>neutralization</b> system (Dynesis) can stabilize degenerative discopathy and protect the adjacent levels. Posterior distraction perturbs the initial hypokyphosis and can lead to pelvic compensation to achieve better dynamic balance. This loss of lordosis is however a cause of excessive mechanical stress on the lumbar structures and can lead to long-term degradation. Future developments of this dynamic system should take into account the essential factor of sagittal balance...|$|E
40|$|In {{most of the}} {{proposals}} for HIF reactors, beams propagate ballistically through the containment chamber. To get the required final radius ({approx} 3 mm), the charge of the beam must be neutralized to some extent. Several neutralization schemes are possible, as co-injection of negative-ions beams, inclusion of external sources of electrons, {{or it can be}} provided by electrons coming from ionization of the background gas. In this work, we study the role of the electron <b>dynamic</b> on the <b>neutralization</b> and final radius of the beam. This is done by performing fully-electromagnetic PIC simulations of the beam ballistic transport using the BPIC code[1]. In agreement with previous works we found that the evolution of an isolated beam is well described as a bidimensional adiabatic compression, and the beam neutralization degree and final radius can be estimated from the initial electron transversal temperature. When a background gas is present the evolution differs significantly from an adiabatic compression. Even for low gas densities, the continuous electrons flow coming from gas ionization limits efficiently the compressional heating, thus reducing the final radius. Aspects of beam neutralization by background gas ionization are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Vertebral {{instability}} is {{a clinical}} condition not yet satisfactorily defined in its multiple aspects: functional, morphological, anatomopathological and pathophysiological. The term "vertebral instability" {{is used in}} a non-rigorous manner by exponents of highly invasive spinal surgery and arthrodesis is still considered the most effective therapy. However, attitudes may be beginning to change. We tackled the problem of vertebral lumbar instability from a functional point of view, correlating the morphological alterations with the functional ones and considering them not as "excessive" but as anomalous movements. We assessed this condition in 26 patients by conventional methods and by biomechanical study "in vivo" with axial-loaded computed tomography (ALCT). The instability was associated with various conditions of disc degeneration, stenosis and spondylolisthesis. All patients underwent <b>dynamic</b> <b>neutralization</b> with the DynesysTM system; 13 patients also underwent microsurgical decompression. At follow-up (average 24 months), lumbar pain {{was found to have}} ceased in 20 patients (77...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the mid-term effects of implant of <b>dynamic</b> <b>neutralization</b> system (Dynesys) on disc tissue {{in patients with}} lumbar discopathy, through the quantiﬁca- tion of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) concentration, both in treated and adjacent levels, by analysis of delayed gado- linium-enhanced MRI contrast (dGEMRIC) images. Materials and Methods: Ten patients with low back pain, underwent the dGEMRIC diagnostic protocol before, 6 - months and after 2 years from surgery. Each patient was also evaluated with visual analog (VAS), Oswestry, and Prolo scales both at presurgery and during follow-up. From dGEMRIC images, a DT 1 parametric map was obtained for each disc, as quantitative indicator of its GAG concentration, and divided in 13 sectors, which were classiﬁed at presurgery as normal or abnormal, based on a 70 -ms threshold. Evolution of DT 1 was studied during the follow-up. Results: Nine of ten patients completed the follow-up. VAS, Oswestry, and Prolo grades showed an improve- ment. This {{was accompanied by a}} reduction of DT 1 in abnormal segments while normal segments showed a pat- tern of initial worsening at 6 months, followed by an improvement after 2 years. Conclusion: Our study conﬁrmed the improvement in clinical evaluation, and for the ﬁrst time related this to the changes in discs GAG concentration...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDynesys (<b>Dynamic</b> <b>Neutralization</b> System) was {{designed}} to overcome the shortcomings of fusion. The Dynesys top loading (DTL) system is a new alternative Dynesys system {{that can be applied}} via a minimally invasive procedure. This study aimed to ascertain whether DTL is a suitable device for motion preservation and prevention of instability, and to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes between DTL and Dynesys. In this study, 12 patients were treated with Dynesys and 21 patients were treated with DTL. Back and leg pain were evaluated using the visual analog scale. The Oswestry Disability Index was used to evaluate the patients' function. Range of motion (ROM) at the operative level and for the whole lumbar spine was measured pre- and postoperatively. The length of wound, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and operation duration were also compared. All patients were followed up for 12 – 76  months. Scores on the visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index were significantly improved postoperatively. The median ROM of the whole spine and index level ROM in all patients showed 12. 5 % and 79. 6 % loss, respectively. The DTL group exhibited significantly better results in terms of blood loss, wound length, and operation duration, in addition to early ambulation. In conclusion, Dynesys and DTL are semirigid fixation systems that can significantly improve clinical symptoms and signs. Our results suggested that DTL was better than Dynesys as a result of it being a minimally invasive procedure. However, further study with large sample sizes and longer follow-up durations is required to validate the effects of these dynamic stabilizers...|$|E
40|$|Background: Decompression and fusion is {{considered}} as the ′gold standard′ {{for the treatment}} of degenerative lumbar diseases, however, many disadvantages have been reported in several studies, recently like donor site pain, pseudoarthrosis, nonunion, screw loosening, instrumentation failure, infection, adjacent segment disease (ASDis) and degeneration. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>neutralization</b> system (Dynesys) avoids many of these disadvantages. This system is made up of pedicle screws, polyethylene terephthalate cords, and polycarbonate urethane spacers to stabilize the functional spinal unit and preserve the adjacent motion after surgeries. This was a retrospective cohort study to compare the effect of Dynesys for treating degenerative lumbar diseases with posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) based on short term followup. Materials and Methods: Seventy five consecutive patients of lumbar degenerative disease operated between October 2010 and November 2012 were studied with a minimum followup of 2 years. Patients were divided into two groups according to the different surgeries. 30 patients underwent decompression and implantation of Dynesys in two levels (n = 29) or three levels (n = 1) and 45 patients underwent PLIF in two levels (n = 39) or three levels (n = 6). Clinical and radiographic outcomes between two groups were reviewed. Results: Thirty patients (male: 17, female: 13) {{with a mean age of}} 55. 96 ± 7. 68 years were included in Dynesys group and the PLIF group included 45 patients (male: 21, female: 24) with a mean age of 54. 69 ± 3. 26 years. The average followup in Dynesys group and PLIF group was 2. 22 ± 0. 43 year (range 2 - 3. 5 year) and 2. 17 ± 0. 76 year (range 2 - 3 year), respectively. Dynesys group showed a shorter operation time (141. 06 ± 11. 36 min vs. 176. 98 ± 6. 72 min, P < 0. 001) and less intraoperative blood loss (386. 76 ± 19. 44 ml vs. 430. 11 ± 24. 72 ml, P < 0. 001). For Dynesys group, visual analogue scale (VAS) for back and leg pain improved from 6. 87 ± 0. 80 to 2. 92 ± 0. 18 and 6. 99 ± 0. 81 to 3. 25 ± 0. 37, (both P < 0. 001) and for PLIF, VAS for back and leg pain also improved significantly (6. 97 ± 0. 84 - 3. 19 ± 0. 19 and 7. 26 ± 0. 76 - 3. 56 ± 0. 38, both P < 0. 001). Significant improvement was found at final followup in both groups in Oswestry disability index (ODI) score (both P < 0. 001). Besides, Dynesys group showed a greater improvement in ODI and VAS back and leg pain scores compared with the PLIF group (P < 0. 001, P = 0. 009 and P = 0. 031, respectively). For radiological, height of the operated level was found increased in both groups (both P < 0. 001), but there was no difference between two groups (P = 0. 93). For range of motion (ROM) of operated level, significant decrease was found in both groups (P < 0. 001), but Dynesys showed a higher preservation of motion at the operative levels (P < 0. 001). However, no significant difference was found in the percentage change of ROM of adjacent levels between Dynesys and PLIF (0. 74 ± 8. 92 % vs. 0. 92 ± 4. 52 %, P = 0. 91). Some patients suffered from degeneration of adjacent intervertebral disc at final followup, but there was no significant difference in adjacent intervertebral disc degeneration between two groups (P = 0. 71). Moreover, there were no differences in complications between Dynesys and PLIF (P = 0. 90), although the incidence of complication in Dynesys was lower than PLIF (16. 67 % vs. 17. 78 %). Conclusion: Dynamic stabilization system treating lumbar degenerative disease showed clinical benefits with motion preservation of the operated segments, but does not have the significant advantage on motion preservation at adjacent segments, to avoid the degeneration of adjacent intervertebral disk...|$|E
