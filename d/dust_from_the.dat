5|$|Data {{from the}} Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere {{satellite}} suggests that noctilucent clouds require water vapour, dust, and very cold temperatures to form. The sources {{of both the}} dust and the water vapour in the upper atmosphere are not known with certainty. The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and <b>dust</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the stratosphere.|$|E
5|$|Other {{suggested}} {{effects of}} the impacts were seismic waves travelling across the planet, an increase in stratospheric haze on the planet due to <b>dust</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> impacts, {{and an increase in}} the mass of the Jovian ring system. However, given that observing such a collision was completely unprecedented, astronomers were cautious with their predictions of what the event might reveal.|$|E
5|$|By 1907, new {{university}} buildings completely {{surrounded the}} observatory; <b>dust</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> construction clogged meteorological instruments, {{and at night}} electric lighting made astronomical work impossible. The Meteorological Office decided to abandon the site and {{move to a new}} building {{at the north end of}} campus on Bloor Street, trading the original Observatory to the University in exchange for the new parcel of land. There was some discussion regarding what to do with the Cooke telescope, since the Meteorological Office had little use for this purely astronomical instrument. No other use was immediately forthcoming, and the telescope moved along with the Meteorological Office to their new Bloor Street Observatory.|$|E

40|$|Two {{different}} plasma termination {{processes by}} dust emission {{were observed in}} long pulse discharges in the Large Helical Device. One is a plasma termination caused by large amounts of carbon <b>dust</b> released <b>from</b> a lower divertor region. The other is termination caused by stainless steel (iron) <b>dust</b> emission <b>from</b> <b>the</b> surface of a helical coil can. The effect of the dust emission on the sustainment of the long pulse discharges are investigated using a three-dimensional edge plasma transport code (EMC 3 -EIRENE) coupled with a dust transport code (DUSTT). The simulation shows that the plasma is more influenced by <b>the</b> iron <b>dust</b> emission <b>from</b> <b>the</b> helical coil can than by <b>the</b> carbon <b>dust</b> emission <b>from</b> <b>the</b> divertor region. The simulation revealed that the plasma flow in divertor legs is quite effective for preventing <b>dust</b> <b>from</b> terminating <b>the</b> long pulse discharges...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{investigations}} of the granulation process of foundry dusts generated in the dry mechanical reclamation process of usedsands, where furan resins were binders are presented in the paper. Investigations concerned producing of granules of the determineddimensions and strength parameters. Granules were formed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dusts</b> mixture consisting in 50 mass% of dusts obtained after the reclamation of the furane sands and in 50 mass % of <b>dusts</b> <b>from</b> sands with bentonite. <b>Dusts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bentonite sands with water were used as a binder allowing the granulation of after reclamation <b>dusts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> furane sands. The following parameters of the ready final product were determined: moisture content (W), shatter test of granules (Wz) performeddirectly after the granulation process and after 1, 3, 5, 10 days and nights of seasoning, water-resistance of granules after 24 hours of being immersed in water, surface porosity ep and volumetric porosity ev. In addition the shatter test and water-resistance of granulate dried at a temperature of 105 oC were determined. Investigations were performed at the bowl angle of inclination 45 o, for three rotational speeds of the bowl being: 10, 15, 20 rpm. For the speed of 10 rpm the granulation tests of dusts mixture after the preliminary mixing in the roller mixer and with the addition ofwater-glass {{in the amount of}} 2 % in relation to the amount of dust were carried out. The obtained results indicate that the granulator allows to obtain granules <b>from</b> <b>dusts</b> originated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> reclamations of mouldingsands with the furane resin with an addition of <b>dusts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bentonite sands processing plants...|$|R

The ash and dust caused extensive damage to the aircraft, including the failure of all four engines. The crew managed to glide the plane out of the dust cloud and restart all four of its engines, although one later had {{to be shut down}} again. The volcanic ash caused the cockpit window to be scratched {{to such an extent that}} it was difficult for the pilots to see out of the plane. However, the aircraft made a successful emergency landing at Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport just outside Jakarta. There were no fatalities or injuries.|$|E
5|$|The Eta Carinae {{star system}} is {{currently}} {{one of the}} most massive that can be studied in great detail. Until recently Eta Carinae was thought to be the most massive single star, but the system's binary nature was proposed by the Brazilian astronomer Augusto Damineli in 1996 and confirmed in 2005. Both component stars are largely obscured by circumstellar material ejected from Eta Carinae A and basic properties such as their temperatures and luminosities can only be inferred. Rapid changes to the stellar wind in the 21st century suggest that the star itself may be revealed as <b>dust</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> great eruption finally clears.|$|E

5|$|During mid-summer (July in the {{northern}} hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When <b>dust</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads {{to an increase in}} red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.|$|E
5|$|In the past, some {{visitors}} {{would write}} {{their names on}} the Wall, or based upon various scriptural verses, would drive nails into the crevices. These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised {{the sanctity of the}} Wall. Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long responsa appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper Havatzelet in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration. More recently the Yalkut Yosef rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or <b>dust</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness. Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a halachic point of view. Blasphemous graffiti once sprayed by a tourist was left visible for months until it began to peel away.|$|E
5|$|The {{inquiry report}} failed to {{identify}} a definite cause, although it was considered that the most likely cause was a spark from the signalling gear. It would have ignited the firedamp, exacerbated and fuelled by coal dust in the air. The report was critical of {{many aspects of the}} management's practices, and considered it had breached the mining regulations in respect of measuring and maintaining the air quality in the workings, and in the removal of coal <b>dust</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tracks and walkways. The report pointed out that because the management had not implemented the changes needed to the ventilation fans as demanded by the Coal Mines Act 1911, the fans were unable to reverse the direction of the airflow, which would have blown the smoke out through the Lancaster shaft, although Redmayne and his colleagues held differing opinions on the advisability of reversing or stopping the airflow. The historian John H Brown, in his examination of the disaster, states that had the airflow been reversed, firedamp or afterdamp could have been extracted from some sectors into the blaze, causing another explosion.|$|E

40|$|An ongoing {{research}} effort {{designed to}} reconstruct the character of historical exposures associated with use of chrysotile-containing joint compounds naturally raised questions concerning how the character (e. g. particle size distributions) of <b>dusts</b> generated <b>from</b> use of recreated materials com-pares to <b>dusts</b> <b>from</b> similar materials manufactured historically. This also provided an opportu-nity to further explore the relative degree that the characteristics of <b>dusts</b> generated <b>from</b> a bulk material are mediated by {{the properties of the}} bulk material versus the mechanical pro-cesses applied to the bulk material by which the dust is generated. In the current study, the char-acteristics of <b>dusts</b> generated <b>from</b> a recreated readymix and recreated drymix were compared to each other, to <b>dusts</b> <b>from</b> a historical dry mix, and to <b>dusts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> commercial chrysotile fiber (JM 7 RF 3) used in the recreated materials.

The main-sequence phase, from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion years for the Sun compared to around two billion years for all other phases of the Sun's pre-remnant life combined.
