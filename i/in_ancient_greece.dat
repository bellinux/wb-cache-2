5|$|Slavery <b>in</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> was {{a common}} practice, as was slavery in other {{societies}} at the time. Some writers <b>in</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> (including, most notably, Aristotle) considered slavery natural and even necessary. This paradigm was notably questioned in Socratic dialogues; the Stoics produced the first recorded condemnation of slavery.|$|E

5|$|Descriptions of the {{tactical}} role of chariots <b>in</b> <b>Ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> and Rome are rare. The Iliad, possibly referring to Mycenaen practices used c.1250 BC, describes {{the use of}} chariots for transporting warriors to and from battle, rather than for actual fighting.

5|$|In {{chemistry}} and physics, atomic theory is a scientific {{theory of the}} nature of matter, which states that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms.

5|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} slavery <b>in</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> is beset by significant methodological problems. Documentation is disjointed and very fragmented, focusing {{primarily on the}} city-state of Athens. No treatises are specifically devoted to the subject, and jurisprudence was interested in slavery only inasmuch as it provided a source of revenue. Greek comedies and tragedies represented stereotypes, while iconography made no substantial differentiation between slaves and craftsmen.|$|E
5|$|While both {{hunting and}} fishing were common, the peasants mostly hunted to protect their herds and crops.

5|$|Ballistas or springalds were siege {{engines that}} {{worked on the}} same {{principles}} as crossbows. With their origins <b>in</b> <b>Ancient</b> <b>Greece,</b> tension was used to project a bolt or javelin. Missiles fired from these engines had a lower trajectory than trebuchets or mangonels and were more accurate. They were more commonly used against the garrison rather than the buildings of a castle. Eventually cannons developed {{to the point where}} they were more powerful and had a greater range than the trebuchet, and became the main weapon in siege warfare.|$|E
5|$|Greek mythology is {{the body}} of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, {{concerning}} their gods and heroes, {{the nature of the}} world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices.

5|$|Halley {{may have}} been {{recorded}} as early as 467BC, but this is uncertain. A comet was recorded <b>in</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>Greece</b> between 468 and 466 BC; its timing, location, duration, and associated meteor shower all suggest it was Halley. According to Pliny the Elder, that same year a meteorite fell {{in the town of}} Aegospotami, in Thrace. He described it as brown in colour and the size of a wagon load. Chinese chroniclers also mention a comet in that year.|$|E

5|$|In 1500 polymath Leonardo da Vinci {{provides}} the first {{illustration of the}} thyroid. In 1543 Anatomist Andreas Vesalius gave the first anatomic description and illustration of the gland. In 1656 the thyroid received its name, by the anatomist Thomas Wharton. The gland was named thyroid, meaning shield, as its shape resembled the shields commonly used <b>in</b> <b>Ancient</b> <b>Greece.</b> The English name thyroid gland {{is derived from the}} medical Latin used by Wharton – glandula thyreoidea. Glandula means gland in Latin, and thyreoidea {{can be traced back to}} the Ancient Greek word θυρεοειδής, meaning shield-like/shield-shaped.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Ancient</b> <b>Greece,</b> {{green and}} blue were {{sometimes}} considered the same color, and the same word sometimes described {{the color of the}} sea and the color of trees. The philosopher Democritus described two different greens: cloron, or pale green, and prasinon, or leek green. Aristotle considered that green was located midway between black, symbolizing the earth, and white, symbolizing water. However, green was not counted among the four classic colors of Greek painting – red, yellow, black and white – and is rarely found in Greek art.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{has been}} {{described}} as belonging to the genres of revisionist history and feminist literature, and employs themes of gender, religion, and power. Bradley wrote it after the success of her 1983 novel The Mists of Avalon, a re-telling of the Arthurian legend from a female perspective. To appeal to a wider readership, The Firebrand includes fewer elements of fantasy than Bradley's previous works. Her only novel set <b>in</b> <b>ancient</b> <b>Greece,</b> her husband Walter H.
