5|$|A book by {{the same}} name was written by Ray and Valerie Vallese and {{released}} by Wizards of the Coast in 1999. The book's plot follows the game's only loosely; for example, in the game, the main character's lack of a name <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of his incomplete state {{and a source of}} protection in being anonymous. In the book, the protagonist chooses a proper name. For the game's re-release on GOG.com a second, more accurate, novelization produced by Rhyss Hess was bundled with the game, based on the game script by Chris Avellone and Colin McComb.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of Edward's {{high regard}} for Lancaster {{that he would}} bestow such {{extensive}} privileges on him. The two men were second cousins through their great-grandfather Henry III and practically coeval (Edward was born in 1312), so it is natural to assume that {{a strong sense of}} camaraderie existed between them. Another factor that might have influenced the king's decision was the fact that Henry had no male heir, so the grant was made for the Earl's lifetime only, and not intended to be hereditary.|$|E
50|$|A lower {{or higher}} than average nasal bridge can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of various genetic disorders, such as fetal alcohol {{syndrome}}. A flat nasal bridge can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), Fragile X syndrome or fetal alcohol syndrome.|$|R
50|$|At the {{inception}} of the human race, the first signs humans encountered and accepted as such, were natural signs. Every natural phenomenon served them as <b>a</b> sign; smoke <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of burning, darkness <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of approaching night, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Eyes down - Avoiding eye contact, {{or looking}} down, can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of {{submission}} or fear. It may {{also indicate that}} someone feels guilt. However, depending on {{the culture of the}} person, it may also just <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of respect.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Jack's Valentine's dinner {{plans with}} his girlfriend Elisa (Salma Hayek) are {{postponed}} {{when they have to}} attend church. Jack calls his office assistant, Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy), telling him to hold his dinner reservations. Before they can leave church, Elisa tells Jack that they need to go to confession. After horrifying the priest (Zak Orth) with his admissions, Elisa becomes furious with Jack and breaks up with him. Later, however, she laments her fight with Jack. After finding a McFlurry coupon in the collection plate, she believes it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> from God because both she and Jack love the McDonald's dessert. The two reconcile their relationship as a result, and spend Valentine's Day together at a McDonald's.|$|E
5|$|Samuel {{eventually}} {{turns up}} drunk {{at a local}} bar, his faith shaken by the death. He is taken into custody. The agents doubt his ability, but {{he is able to}} convince Mulder that he knows the latter has lost a sister—Samantha—at a young age. Mulder has been seeing visions of Samantha, and continues to see them. At Samuel's bail hearing, the courtroom fills with a swarm of locusts, which Samuel claims <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of God's wrath against him.|$|E
5|$|Scientists also {{view the}} ability to grow very long hair {{as a result of}} sexual selection, since long and healthy hair <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of {{fertility}} and youth. An evolutionary biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as a cue to youth and health, signifying a woman's reproductive potential. As hair grows slowly, long hair may reveal 2–3 years of a person's health status, nutrition, age and reproductive fitness. Malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes in hair color (e.g. dark hair turning reddish).|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, actress Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) auditions {{for a role}} she {{believes}} is for a college freshman on Gossip Girl. At the audition, Jenna learns that she is actually booked to audition {{for the role of}} the college freshman's mother. She panics, believing that this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> that she is no longer young, and in an attempt to reclaim her youth, begins acting young which causes the TGS writing staff to mock her. At the same time, movie star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) decides to add a woman to his entourage as a learning experience when he and his wife, Angie (Sherri Shepherd), have a daughter. He brings in the French-Dutch TGS writer Sue Laroche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway). Tracy later loses his temper with a crew member, thinking that he made a suggestive comment about Sue, causing NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) to tell Tracy that he has become paternal towards Sue. Soon after, Sue begins rebelling against him, as Tracy treats her as a child.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic {{people is not}} indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, {{should be aware of}} the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A cervical screening test, such as a Pap smear, is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially in the early stages of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or hematometra).|$|E
5|$|Once, Khandoba and Mhalsa {{play a game}} of saripat (translated as game of dice or chess). Khandoba loses {{everything}} to Mhalsa in the wager, except his dhoti, his flag, his staff (wand) and his bhandari, the bag of magical bhandara (turmeric powder). In a dream, he sees Banai and falls in love with her. He goes on a hunt in the forest, gets away from the army and stays with Banai for twelve years. He marries her in non-ritualistic marriage and brings her back to Jejuri. A variant describes how Khandoba arrives in Chandanpur on a hunting expedition and becomes thirsty. A Dhangar directs him to Banai's vada. Banai offers him water or sends a pot of water, in which Khandoba reads Banai's name. In another version, the pot with nine jewels <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> for Khandoba to recognise Banai, the girl he saw in his dream. He falls for her and loses purposefully in saripat with Mhalsa and accepts a twelve-year exile. In this period, he disguises himself as an impoverished, old leper and becomes a man-servant of Banai's father. Some folk songs have erotic overtones, for example, some songs give erotic descriptions of Banai's beauty which maddens Khandoba.|$|E

25|$|III. Rheme, dicisign, {{argument}} (also called sumisign, dicisign, suadisign, also seme, pheme, delome, {{and regarded}} as very broadened {{versions of the}} traditional term, proposition, argument): This typology classifies every sign according to the category which the interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting its object—the rheme, for example a term, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality; the dicisign, for example a proposition, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact; and the argument <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> interpreted to represent its object in respect of habit or law. This is the culminating typology of the three, where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference.|$|E
