25|$|In January 1993, Carl Binder {{joined the}} project, having {{previous}} expertise {{as a television}} writer on popular sitcoms such as Punky Brewster and television series such as War of the Worlds, , and Top Cops. Four months later, Susannah Grant (no relation to Joe Grant) and Philip LaZebnik joined the writing team. Grant herself was selected by Disney as a screenwriter on Pocahontas after winning the Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting awarded by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences the year before while still attending film school. Onboard as a screenwriter, she {{was only one of}} the many who was contributing the specific vision the upper management at Disney had in mind, and collaborated with Native American consultants. While working on the movie, Grant wrote to a specific story outline, and no scene was rewritten less than thirty-five times until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perfect.</b>|$|E

The realistic design of the new puppets has been praised by Vincent Terrace and criticised by others. Certain members of the production staff had the impression that they lacked the charm of the earlier generation of puppets due to the authentic proportions that were now being used. Director David Lane's initial thoughts on a prototype, sculpted by head puppet-maker John Brown, were, [...] "it was as if there was a little dead person in ... because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perfect</b> in all its proportions it just looked odd." [...] Brown remembers placing the prototype next to the Lady Penelope puppet from Thunderbirds and gauging the response from colleagues: [...] "When they saw it, some people were horrified by the difference. Some didn't like it, some did." [...] Commentators have noted that facial expression was sacrificed in favour of a realistic design, a result on which Terry Curtis remembers: ...|$|E

500|$|Originally, songwriters George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam {{had written}} the song's demo for Janet Jackson, {{employed}} by A Records executive, John McClain. However, after hearing the song, Jackson's management passed on the song, feeling it was too weak in comparison to her other material. In an interview with Fred Bronson, Merrill expressed his feelings after learning of Jackson's decision. [...] "We were pretty upset because we thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perfect</b> for her at the time. We had written it with her completely in mind." [...] During this period, Brenda Andrews, at Almo-Irving Music, Merrill and Rubicam's publisher, played the song for Gerry Griffith, the director for R music at A and Arista Records. Griffith, who was compiling material for Houston's debut at the time, felt the song perfectly matched her sound. He soon contacted Andrews and the song's two writers and implored that they should relinquish the song to him for Houston's debut album. Griffith described his discovery of the song, and what he and Clive Davis thought of it: ...|$|E
500|$|Mughal-e-Azam {{became the}} first {{full-length}} feature film colourised for a theatrical re-release; although some Hollywood films had been colourised earlier, they were only available for home media. It was subsequently selected for seven international film festivals. Upon release, the film drew crowds to the cinemas, with an overall occupancy of 90 per cent. Subsequently, it completed a 25-week run. While some critics complained that the colours were [...] "psychedelic" [...] or [...] "unnatural", others hailed the effort as a technological achievement. Film critic Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times remarked that while colourising {{was not a good}} idea for most black-and-white classics, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perfect</b> in this particular instance. He compared it to films by Cecil B. DeMille and to Gone With the Wind (1939) for its larger-than-life storytelling. The Guardian said that although the new version was an improvement, [...] "the fake colours tend to look flat and brash, detracting from cinematographer RD Mathur's elegantly composed shots." [...] The BBC's Jaspreet Pandohar, observing that the film was [...] "restored in appealing candy-colours and high quality sound", considered it a [...] "cross between Gone With the Wind and Ben-Hur". Other critics have said that they prefer the black and white version.|$|E
500|$|During a {{scene with}} Ron and Tammy start {{stripping}} while running into a motel room, Mullally removed her top and appeared topless during filming. Mullally improvised the move {{and did not}} tell the crew she planned to do it. She said of filming the scene, [...] "I didn't care, it was six in the morning, who cares, I didn't know anybody." [...] Offerman said his favorite scene in the episode was the one in which Leslie tried to break up with Tammy for him. He particularly enjoyed the rapport between Poehler and Mullally, and said he [...] "just wanted to pinch himself" [...] to prevent from laughing. After reuniting with Tammy, Ron puts a framed photo on his wall of a brunette woman holding a plate of breakfast, which he said symbolizes his relationship with Tammy and the breakfast she made him after sex. In the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation, a photo of retired basketball coach Bobby Knight is on the wall. When it had to be removed for legal reasons, Parks and Recreation Schur searched an image library for [...] "things we thought Ron would like" [...] and found the breakfast photo. Schur said he thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perfect</b> for the character, and it inspired the prop and the dialogue in the episode.

500|$|Regarding {{the look}} {{and nature of the}} film's cinematography, Giaimo was greatly {{influenced}} by Jack Cardiff's work in Black Narcissus. According to him, it lent a hyper-reality to the film: [...] "Because this is a movie with such scale and we have the Norwegian fjords to draw from, I really wanted to explore the depth. From a design perspective, since I was stressing the horizontal and vertical aspects, and what the fjords provide, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perfect.</b> We encased the sibling story in scale." [...] Ted D. McCord's work in The Sound of Music was another major influence for Giaimo. It was also Giaimo's idea that Frozen should be filmed in the CinemaScope aspect ratio, which was approved by Lasseter. This marked Frozen the first film to be completely shot in CinemaScope since 2000's Titan A.E.. Giaimo also wanted to ensure that Norway's fjords, architecture and rosemaling folk art, were critical factors in designing the environment of Arendelle. Giaimo, whose background is in traditional animation, said that the art design environment represents a unity of character and environment and that he originally wanted to incorporate saturated colors, which is typically ill-advised in computer animation. For further authenticity, a live reindeer named Sage was brought into the studio for animators to study its movements and mannerisms for the character Sven.|$|E
500|$|The song {{originally}} featured vocals from American {{recording artist}} Mary J. Blige, whose {{version of the}} song leaked online in July 2011. In an interview with News.com.au, Guetta spoke about its leak, saying, [...] "You shouldn't even know about that...I'd rather not speak about it. That was annoying. It wasn't supposed to be out there." [...] Sia recorded a demo of the song, which was then sent to Blige and other artists. Eventually, Guetta decided {{to stay with her}} version. He explained, [...] "The first time I heard what Sia did, because she was not in the studio with me, I fell in love with it...I didn't even want to give it to anyone else; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perfect</b> the way it was. It's not only about how big you are in America, it's about the song and the voice." [...] American pop singer Katy Perry {{was the first person to}} be offered the track but turned it down because she felt its message was too similar to that of her song [...] "Firework". An insider told Take 40 Australia, [...] "So that 'Titanium' song, Sia wrote it for Katy, but [...] didn't want to do a song with Guetta..." [...] According to Sia's manager, Jonathan Daniel of Crush Management, Sia wrote the song for American R singer Alicia Keys. Guetta considered approaching other female singers to record on the song, however Perry advised him to keep Sia on the track. Guetta ultimately followed this suggestion. Sia revealed that Guetta put her vocals on the song without asking for permission: ...|$|E

[...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly felt that the premiere was mind-blowing and featured good acting by Garcia.

[...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode 9.1/10, stating that it was [...] "a great start to what promises to be an exciting... season 4. [...] The momentum and pacing is on par with last season's finale". [...] LTG of Television Without Pity graded it as an [...] "A–". [...] Jon Lachonis of UGO gave the episode an [...] "A+", calling it [...] "a crushingly emotional, action packed introduction... that... Losts groundbreaking protean form still has plenty of blinding ways to dazzle and entertain {{in a way that is}} nonetheless unique unto itself."

[...] Butler said he was drawn to the house by its ‘50s style and big, wooded lot. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>perfect</b> for his collections of Mid Century Modern furniture and British Invasion music equipment.
