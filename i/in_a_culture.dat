Although he and Thatgamecompany can and have made more traditional games, he does not plan on commercially developing any of them, as he does not think that it fits with their goals as an independent video game developer.|$|E
5|$|Reynolds and Reynolds {{was founded}} in 1866 as a printer of {{standardized}} business forms. It began developing and marketing digital products in the 1960s. This {{was followed by a}} major down-sizing of the printing division and subsequent advancements in its software products. By the 1980s, Reynolds and Reynolds had won contracts with all of the Big Three automotive manufacturers, as well as some insurance businesses. The company went public in 1961, but was re-formed as a private company in 2006, when it was merged with Universal Computer Systems, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> clash between the two companies.|$|E
5|$|Survivals {{from late}} Medieval church {{fittings}} and objects in Scotland are exceptionally rare even {{compared to those}} from comparable areas like England or Norway, probably because of the thoroughness of their destruction in the Scottish Reformation. The Scottish elite and church now participated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> stretching across Europe, and many objects that do survive are imported, such as Limoges enamels. It {{is often difficult to}} decide the country of creation of others, as work in international styles was produced in Scotland, along with pieces retaining more distinctive local styles.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the impact of culture on the trust {{determinants}} in e-commerce. Adopting two broad trust building foundations (cognition-based and affect-based trust) from cross-culture literature and focusing on well-established cultural constructs as groups of culture, this study develops a theoretical model of cognition-based versus affect-based e-vendor trust, and empirically tests the model using cross-cultural data. The results show that cognition-based trust determinants are more positively related to consumer trust <b>in</b> evendor <b>in</b> <b>an</b> individualist <b>culture</b> than <b>in</b> <b>a</b> collectivist <b>culture.</b> Affect-based trust determinants are more positively related to consumer trust <b>in</b> e-vendor <b>in</b> <b>a</b> collectivist <b>culture</b> than <b>in</b> <b>an</b> individualist <b>culture.</b> Limitation and implications for practice are also discussed...|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, a {{significant}} number of lynchings occurred in the Southern United States, primarily of African Americans in the states of Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas. Between 1890 and 1920, about 3,000 African Americans were killed by lynch mobs, usually after whites were the victims of crimes purportedly committed by blacks. Supporters of lynching justified the practice as a way to assert dominance over African Americans, to whom they attributed a criminal nature. Lynching also provided a sense of white solidarity <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> with changing demographics and power structures. Although lynching was tolerated by much of southern society, opponents of the practice emerged, including some religious leaders and the nascent National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).|$|E
5|$|Marian devotion {{grew from}} the 13th century, mostly forming around the {{concepts}} of the Immaculate Conception and her Assumption into heaven. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> that venerated the possession of relics {{as a means to}} bring the earthly closer to the divine, Mary left no bodily relics, thus assuming a special position between heaven and humanity. By the early 15th century, Mary had grown in importance within the Christian doctrine to the extent that she was commonly seen as the most accessible intercessor with God. It was thought that the length each person would need to suffer in limbo was proportional to their display of devotion while on earth. The veneration of Mary reached a peak in the early 15th century, an era that saw an unending demand for works depicting her likeness. From the mid-15th century, Netherlandish portrayals of the life of Christ tended to be centred on the iconography of the Man of Sorrows.|$|E

Religious officials, who often held positions of power, were the spiritual intermediaries to the common person.
