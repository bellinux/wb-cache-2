The modern cargo handling facility {{on board the}} ship enables transfer of heavy solid cargo via a 30 tonne capacity <b>deck</b> <b>crane,</b> and simultaneous fuelling of multiple ships at sea, and can refuel {{at the rate of}} 1,500 tonnes per hour. Workshop facilities on the ship can support other ships of the fleet and it is capable of supporting heavy helicopters.|$|E
25|$|As built, Salvor had a 7.5-ton {{capacity}} boom on {{a forward}} kingpost. However, the kingpost and boom were removed {{and replaced by}} a 10,000-pound <b>deck</b> <b>crane</b> in 2011. She has 40-ton capacity boom on her aft kingpost.|$|E
25|$|On 21 September 2010, Kanimbla {{was leaving}} Sydney Harbour when a {{fire broke out}} aboard and caused the ship to lose power briefly. Shortly after this, Kanimbla and sister ship Manoora were brought to Fleet Base East for an 'operational pause' after several {{problems}} were identified with both ships. These included large quantities of corrosion and faults with the <b>deck</b> <b>crane</b> and alarm system, along {{with the need to}} overhaul the propulsion system, power generators, and air-conditioning, and upgrade the communication suite. The problems have been attributed to the ship's high operational tempo, delays in maintenance, and the age of the ships.|$|E

25|$|The {{most obvious}} changes {{made to the}} Bombo were the fitting of a mast {{amidships}} replacing the original <b>deck</b> <b>crane,</b> a smaller mainmast on the aft deck, {{and a range of}} armaments. Her initial assignment was as an auxiliary minesweeper, and for this role she was fitted with a 12-pound deck gun on an elevated platform forward, two heavy machine-guns amidships, and four anti-submarine depth charges set-up at the stern. In 1944 she was converted to a stores carrier, and modifications included replacing the machine-guns with twin platform-mounted 20mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannon, adding a protective shield to the 12-pounder, and fitting twin derricks to the midship mast.|$|E
25|$|In late September 2010, both {{ships were}} brought to Fleet Base East for an 'operational pause' after several {{problems}} were identified with the ships. These included large quantities of corrosion, faults with the <b>deck</b> <b>crane</b> and alarm system, the need to overhaul propulsion machinery, power generators, and air conditioning, and an outdated communication suite. The problems {{have been attributed to}} the ship's high operational tempo, delays in maintenance, and the age of the ships. On 1 November it was reported that the two vessels might never put to sea again due to their poor condition, but a Navy spokesman was quoted the next day as saying that they would both be repaired by early 2011.|$|E
25|$|Some {{modifications}} {{were made}} to cargo spaces and cargo handling equipment. The aftmost lower hold {{was turned into a}} refrigerated cargo space and a dividing bulkhead was removed from the foremost hold. The tweendeck hatch covers were changed from wire-operated to hydraulic and, due to the rearranging of the aft deck winches and to ease the handling of mooring lines, the aft hatch was made slightly smaller than in the original ships. The capacity of the <b>deck</b> <b>crane</b> in front of the superstructure was increased to 40 tons to allow better handling of ore containers. The stern quarter ramp was also changed to a folding type that would maintain constant pressure on the quay. There were also some changes to the general arrangements of the lowest accommodation deck.|$|E

500|$|A <b>deck</b> <b>crane</b> {{was used}} for the {{construction}} of the main span of the bridge. A specially designed crane of 45tonne capacity was used to erect the pylons of the bridge. The structural steel used in the bridge weighs about 13,200 tonnes. The pylons, which are [...] in height, are designed as free standing portals. They are provided with two cross portal members, one at the bottom and another at the top, below the pylon head. The deck is connected to the end piers by bolts embedded in the chambers of the piers. Pylons made of [...] steel boxes of riveted construction were raised on the two side spans of the bridge; one set is on the Calcutta side and the other is on the Howrah side. The six pylons on the Calcutta side of the bridge were installed using 75 MT and 50 MT cranes, while on the Howrah end, a single 50 MT crane was used. Anchorage of the pylon with the base of piers was effected through Dywidag rods, duly anchored in the piers. Cables were erected from the four pylon heads with the help of 32 MT hoist frames. The hoist frames were mounted on top of each pylon. Sheave blocks, winches and snatch blocks were used to facilitate the lifting, and cables inside the pylons were stressed with jacks. Pressure grouting was performed to fill the voids between the wire and the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tubes. A twotonne tower crane, fixed inside the pylons, lifted the cables into position.|$|E

50|$|Today, pinisi mainly {{used for}} trade, serves as inter-insular cargo, such as to {{transport}} timber from Kalimantan to Java, in exchange to transporting grocery and goods from industrialized Java to more remote ports in Indonesian archipelago. Pinisi often frequent traditional ports, such as Sunda Kelapa port in Jakarta, Surabaya, Banjarmasin, and {{the port of}} Makassar. As with many traditional ship types, pinisi have been provided with motors, largely since 1970. This has changed {{the appearance of the}} ships. Comparable to modern dhows, the masts have been shortened, or omitted as <b>deck</b> <b>cranes</b> vanished completely, while structures on deck, usually aft, have been enlarged for the crew and passengers.|$|R
500|$|The bow hit {{the bottom}} {{at a speed}} of about , digging about [...] deep into the mud, up {{to the base of}} the anchors. The impact bent the hull in two places and caused it to buckle {{downwards}} by about 10° under the forward well <b>deck</b> <b>cranes</b> and by about 4° under the forward expansion joint. When the bow section hit the sea bed, the weakened decks at the rear, where the ship had broken apart, collapsed on top of each other. The forward hatch cover was also blown off and landed a couple of hundred feet in front of the bow, possibly due to the force of water being pushed out as the bow impacted the bottom.|$|R
