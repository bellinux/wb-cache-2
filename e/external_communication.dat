Sputnik 1 was a simple polished metal sphere no bigger than a beach ball, containing batteries powering a transmitter using 4 <b>external</b> <b>communication</b> antennae. Korolev personally managed the assembly at a hectic pace; and the satellite was placed in orbit using a rocket that had successfully launched only once before. International response to the accomplishment was electrifying, and political ramifications continued for decades.

500|$|Both {{internal}} and <b>external</b> <b>communication</b> systems {{as well as}} means of reconnaissance were needed, both directed by the commandant located in the headquarters building. The buildingfinished in 1910had three floors, the upper two functioned as home and workplace for the commandant and the chief of staff, while the ground floor had extra thick walls and functioned as the command post for the fortress. A large field telephone network was built, connecting all forts with the headquarters. Liaison with higher commands was at first maintained by regular post, telegraph and telephone. The fortress' radio station was finished by 1914, originally for the Swedish Navy, and was located south of Degerberget on a bog {{now known as the}} [...] "Radio Mire" [...] (...) [...] The first Swedish radio broadcasts were sent from this building. The fortress also had homing pigeons for sending messages. At the end of the Second World War, around 280 such pigeons were stationed in Boden. The pigeons were part of the balloon department whose main task was to operate the balloon of the garrison. For this, the Balloon Hangar with inner measurements of [...] was built near the radio station. More than fifty men were attached to the department, of whom two could follow the balloon up to its maximum height of , limited by the length of the wire connecting it to the ground.

Most of the research relates to the <b>external</b> dimension of <b>communication</b> and in contrary; this study aims to contribute in an internal communicative perspective of crisis communication research. The study is a descriptive case study {{of the city of}} Gothenburg and interviews with Communication Managers of the municipally owned companies have been conducted. The focus lies on which communication strategies the companies use for internal communication in crisis management. Using the research question of: “What are the implications of internal crisis communication?” and an inductive approach, the interviews have been analyzed with a grounded theory technique and further compared with existing crisis communication and public relation theory, in order to identify and discuss what internal crisis communication implies practically and theoretically. The findings indicate that internal crisis communication to some extent {{can be seen as a}} variation of <b>external</b> crisis <b>communication,</b> but also includes a problematic balance concerning to support and accommodate the employees, which is not identified in <b>external</b> crisis <b>communication.</b> Theoretically, the result indicates internal crisis communication to imply a different, less strategic form of crisis communication...|$|R
