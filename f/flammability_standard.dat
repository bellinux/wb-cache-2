40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{well known}} that {{silicone}} surfactants have an influence on the flammability of the manufactured foam. Generally silicone surfactants {{have a negative impact on}} flammability, e. g., higher levels of flame-retardants (FRs) are necessary to pass the required FR test. During the recent years, Degussa has put a lot of resources into the develop-ment of optimized chemical structures that have a minimal impact on flamma-bility. The challenge is to make these changes without impacting other key properties, like stabilization potency and processing latitude. In early 2002, the State of California proposed a change to the old CAL TB 117, the industry <b>flammability</b> <b>standard</b> for furniture foam in the US since 1975.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Concern has mounted {{over health}} effects caused by {{exposure}} to flame retardant additives used in consumer products. Significant research efforts have focused particularly on exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) used in furniture and electronic applications. However, little attention has focused on applications in textiles, particularly textiles meeting a <b>flammability</b> <b>standard</b> known as CPAI- 84. In this study, we investigated flame retardant applications in camping tents that met CPAI- 84 standards by analyzing 11 samples of tent fabrics for chemical flame retardant additives. Furthermore, we investigated potential exposure by collecting paired samples of tent wipes and hand wipes from 27 individuals after tent setup. Of the 11 fabric samples analyzed, 10 contained flame retardant additives, which included tris(1, 3 -dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCPP), decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE- 209), triphenyl phosphate, and tetrabromobisphenol-A. Flame retardant concentrations were discovered to {{be as high as}} 37. 5 mg/g (3. 8 % by weight) in the tent fabric samples, and TDCPP and BDE- 209 were the most frequently detected in these samples.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Higher house dust {{levels of}} PBDE flame retardants (FRs) have been {{reported}} in California than other parts of the world, due to the state’s furniture <b>flammability</b> <b>standard.</b> However, changing levels of these and other FRs have not been evaluated following the 2004 U. S. phase-out of PentaBDE and OctaBDE. We analyzed dust collected in 16 California homes in 2006 and again in 2011 for 62 FRs and organohalogens, which represents the broadest investigation of FRs in homes. Fifty-five compounds were detected in at least one sample; 41 in at least 50 % of samples. Concentrations of chlorinated OPFRs, including two (TCEP and TDCIPP) listed as carcinogens under California’s Proposition 65, were found up to 0. 01 % in dust, higher than previously reported in the U. S. In 75 % of the homes, we detected TDBPP, or brominated “Tris, ” which was banned in children’s sleepwear because of carcinogenicity. To our knowledge, this is the first report on TDBPP in house dust. Concentrations of Firemaster 550 components (EH-TBB, BEH-TEBP, and TPHP) were higher in 2011 than 2006, consistent with its use as a PentaBDE replacement. Results highlight th...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: California’s {{furniture}} <b>flammability</b> <b>standard</b> Technical Bulletin 117 (TB 117) {{is believed}} to be a major driver of chemical flame retardant (FR) use in residential furniture in the United States. With the phase-out of the polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) FR mixture PentaBDE in 2005, alternative FRs are increasingly being used to meet TB 117; however, it was unclear which chemicals were being used and how frequently. To address this data gap, we collected and analyzed 102 samples of polyurethane foam from residential couches purchased in the United States from 1985 to 2010. Overall, we detected chemical flame retardants in 85 % of the couches. In samples purchased prior to 2005 (n = 41) PBDEs associated with the PentaBDE mixture including BDEs 47, 99, and 100 (PentaBDE) were the most common FR detected (39 %), followed by tris(1, 3 -dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCPP; 24 %), which is a suspected human carcinogen. In samples purchased in 2005 or later (n = 61) the most common FRs detected were TDCPP (52 %) and components associated with the Firemaster 550 (FM 550) mixture (18 %).

40|$|Studies show higher house {{dust and}} body burden levels of PBDE flame retardants in North America than Europe; but {{little is known}} about {{exposure}} variation within North America, where California's furniture <b>flammability</b> <b>standard</b> affects PBDE use. We compared dust samples from 49 homes in two California communities with 120 Massachusetts homes and with other published studies. Dust concentrations [median (range) ng/g] in California homes of BDE- 47, - 99, and - 100 were 2700 (112 - 107 000), 3800 (102 - 170 000), and 684 (< MRL- 30 900), respectively, and were 4 - 10 times higher than previously reported in North America. Maximum concentrations were the highest ever reported in indoor dust. We then investigated whether human serum PBDE levels were also higher in California compared to other North American regions by analyzing the 2003 - 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the only data set available with serum from a representative sample of the U. S. population (n = 2040). California residence was significantly associated with nearly 2 -fold higher ΣPBDE serum levels [least square geometric mean (LSGM) ng/g lipid, 73. 0 vs 38. 5 (p = 0. 002) ].

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityThe commercial polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) mixture known as PentaBDE was once the primary flame retardant (FR) used in the US to comply with California's Technical Bulletin 117 (TB 117) - a mandated <b>flammability</b> <b>standard</b> for polyurethane foam within upholstered furniture and baby products. In 2004, due to concerns about persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity, PentaBDE was voluntarily phased out, prompting an industry-wide shift toward the use of alternative flame retardant formulations containing {{at least one of}} the two major classes of organophosphate-based flame retardants (OPFRs) - chlorinated phosphate esters (CPEs) and aryl phosphate esters (APEs). Due to rapid adoption as PentaBDE replacements, organophosphate-based flame retardants (OPFRs) have been detected at concentrations comparable to and, in some cases, higher than total PBDE concentrations in household dust, suggesting that chronic human exposure to these alternative flame retardants following leaching from treated products is common within the United States. Despite the need for a better understanding of the potential developmental effects of OPFRs (since infants and children tend to (1) ingest more house dust than adults due to crawling and mouthing behaviors and (2) be exposed up to five times the acceptable daily OPFR intake level due to use in residential furniture), most studies to date have focused on the genotoxicity or neurotoxicity of OPFRs within adult animals. Using zebrafish as an animal model, the objective of these studies was to begin uncovering the mechanisms of developmental toxicity for OPFRs commonly detected within indoor environments. Our results demonstrate that the two major classes of OPFRs - CPEs and APEs - exhibit distinct mechanisms of toxicity during zebrafish embryogenesis. Specifically, exposure to the high-production volume CPE tris(1, 3 - dichloro- 2 -propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) delayed zygotic genome remethylation during early embryogenesis, while exposure to triphenyl phosphate (TPP) and monoisopropylated triaryl phosphate (Mono-ITP) - two APEs that account for 49 % of Firemaster 550, a major PentaBDE replacement - resulted in severe cardiac abnormalities during early vertebrate development. Overall, these results are the first to show early developmental toxicity of widely used and detected OPFRs...|$|E

30|$|The fire {{performance}} of mattresses is regulated in the United States using {{two types of}} ignition source; smoldering and open flame ignition. The current U.S. mattress <b>flammability</b> <b>standards</b> that have the most significant impact on industry and the consumer are 16 CFR 1632 (16 CFR 1632 <b>Standard</b> for the <b>flammability</b> of mattresses and mattress pads [1991]) and 16 CFR 1633 (16 CFR 1633 [2007]). The two federal <b>flammability</b> regulatory <b>standards</b> (16 CFR 1632 and 16 CFR 1633) are mandatory, and all manufacturers must comply with {{them in order to}} sell residential mattresses in the U.S. (Table 1). The 16 CFR 1632 regulation, introduced by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in 1973, defines the fire resistance of mattresses to cigarette ignition, a smoldering source. The smoldering ignition test measures the char length over the mattress surface and the extent of damage to the mattress after a specified time period (Table 1).|$|R
30|$|Generally, {{mattress}} <b>flammability</b> <b>standards</b> prescribe {{full-scale testing}} of a prototype mattress (mattress without bedclothes) {{when exposed to}} different ignition sources. The ignition sources defined for the mattress flammability test in Table 1 represent the fire hazard of a mattress. For example, the Michigan Roll-up test defined by the Boston Fire Department, U.S., requires testing of mattresses used in jails to be tested as rolled up mattresses stuffed with newspaper.
