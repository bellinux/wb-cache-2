500|$|Rhinehart {{comments}} {{that those who}} have taken part in the est training feel the need for a sense of community: [...] "Most graduates indicate that the value of the seminar series depends not so much on it's ostensible <b>data</b> <b>content</b> or on the processes introduced, but on the sharing on an intimate basis with others." [...] He notes that some of the graduates of the est training [...] "treat him [...] with the love and awe normally associated with that of disciples for spiritual teachers". He likens Erhard's relationship to his staff members {{to the way in which}} a guru interacts with disciples: [...] " [...] the essentially eastern phenomenon of a powerful being [...] (usually a guru or a spiritual teacher) attracting other powerful beings who nevertheless choose to channel their power through their leader." [...] Rhinehart argues that est [...] "may be seen as in many ways the culmination to date of the 'Easternization of America', a process that first became notable in the late fifties and early sixties".|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{integrate}} {{a wide variety}} of databases or many diverse sources of information, we need the ability to learn the similarities directly from instances of the data, which may be embodied within a database model, a conceptual schema, application programs, or <b>data</b> <b>contents.</b> The process of determining semantically equivalent data items can not be "pre-programmed" since the information to be accessed is heterogeneous. Intelligent information integration involves extracting semantics, expressing them as metadata, and matching semantically equivalent data elements. Semint (SEMantic INTegrator) is a system prototype for semantic integration being developed at Northwestern University. It provides a graphical user interface and supports access to a variety of database systems and utilizes both schema information and <b>data</b> <b>contents</b> to determine attribute equivalence. In Semint, the knowledge of how to match equivalent data elements is "discovered ", not "pre-programmed". Introduction Ap [...] ...|$|R
