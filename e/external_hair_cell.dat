40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to asses the non-thermal effects of the {{electromagnetic}} fields generated by 915 MHz GSM cellular phones on the human cochlear activity using transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE). The study was carried on 205 young and healthy volunteers (age 18 - 30 years) with normal hearing which were randomly divided into two samples consisting of 85 (Gcase) and 120 (Gcontrol) respectively. The first one was exposed to genuine 10 minutes of GSM electromagnetic fields while the second, undergone sham exposure, was considered as control group for the statistical investigations. All the participants were blind to the genuine or sham exposure. The TEOAEs were measured in the time domain and the Welch’s method was used for analysis. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in the mean TEOAEs amplitude shifts before and throughout genuine and/or sham mobile phone EMF 10 min exposure.

40|$|Hearing loss {{induced by}} high sound {{pressure}} levels (HLIHSPL) related {{to work is}} the gradual decrease of hearing acuity resulting from the continuing exposure {{to high levels of}} sound pressure 2 - 12. HLIHSPL is characterized by altera-tions in the <b>external</b> <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> of the organ of Corti, which are sensitive to strong and prolonged sound pressures, resulting in irreversible hearing impair-ments, tinnitus and even dizziness, because of the proximity between the cochlea and the vestibular system. Therefore, alterations in the hearing thresholds are sensorineural, initially affecting one or more frequencies of the 3 - 6 KHz range 13 - 17. On the other hand, higher and lower frequencies may take longer to be affected, according to the continuity of exposure; once the exposure to noise is discon-tinued, the process of hearing reduction ceases 9, 18. Therefore, the impairment is usually proportional to time of exposure to noise 9, although there are subjects that, being more susceptible to high sound pressure levels, have reduced hearing acuity even with a short period of exposure 19. A study has reported that 110 million people are currently exposed to high levels of sound pressure, and 25 % of the world population has some level of HLIHSPL 12...|$|R
40|$|Os animais com sensibilidade audiogênica, Wistar Audiogenic Rats (WAR) são modelos experimentais utilizados em pesquisas sobre audição, integração sensório-motora e epilepsias, entre elas as crises audiogênicas. O modelo de estimulação sonora repetida conhecido como {{kindling}} ou abrasamento audiogênico mimetiza um tipo de epilepsia parcial com envolvimento de estruturas límbicas. É também um modelo genético de grande importância para o estudo das epilepsias porque retrata crises em animais com seleção genética controlada. O objetivo desse estudo foi investigar as alterações morfológicas e funcionais em células ciliadas internas e externas da orelha interna em animais da cepa WAR submetidos ao abrasamento audiogênico comparando-os com animais controle. Foram utilizados 40 animais com idade de 80 a 120 dias. Os animais selecionados foram divididos em quatro grupos de estudo. Foram utilizados os animais que apresentaram função coclear normal, avaliada através do reflexo de Preyer, emissões otoacústicas por produtos de distorção (EOAPD) e limiar eletrofisiológico medido pelos potenciais evocados auditivos de tronco encefálico (PEATE). A avaliação funcional foi realizada antes do primeiro estímulo acústico e imediatamente após o último estímulo acústico. Em seguida foi realizada perfusão intracardíaca, os animais tiveram suas bulas removidas e as cócleas processadas para microscopia eletrônica de varredura. Em relação às EOAPD, os animais do grupo WAR-kindling apresentaram diferença significativa na relação sinal-ruído, sendo que animais WAR pré-kindling possuem valores significativamente superiores aos do pós-kindling. Em relação ao PEATE houve uma diferença significativa, o grupo WAR-kindling apresentou limiares com valores significativamente superiores aos do grupo Wistar kindling. Por microscopia eletrônica de varredura nos animais da cepa WAR observou-se uma estrutura irregular nos feixes de estereocílios das células ciliadas internas (CCI) e células ciliadas externas (CCE). Os exames para avaliação auditiva funcional (EOAPD), eletrofisiológica (PEATE) associados à microscopia eletrônica de varredura permitiram caracterizar as alterações morfológicas e funcionais em CCI e CCE da orelha interna em animais com sensibilidade audiogênica da cepa WAR como potenciais sequelas do abrasamento audiogênico. Os presentes dados confirmam a hipótese de que o abrasamento audiogênico na cepa WAR provoca impacto funcional e morfológico da orelha interna. Animals of the Wistar Audiogenic Rat (WAR) strain {{are used}} as experimental models in research of auditory function, sensorimotor integration and epilepsy studies, including audiogenic seizures. The model of repeated acoustic stimulation mimics temporal lobe partial epilepsy with involvement of limbic structures and is of great importance {{to the study of}} epilepsy because it portrays a genetically selected strain. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the morphological and functional changes in inner and outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> of the inner ear in the WAR strain after exposure to repeated acoustic stimulation and compared to control animals. 40 animals from 80 to 120 days old were included. The animals were divided into four groups of study. The animals used were those with normal cochlear function, evaluated through the Preyer Reflex, otoacoustic emissions by distortion product (DPOAE) and electrophysiological threshold measured by brainstem auditory evoked potentials (ABR). The functional assessment was performed before the first acoustic stimulus and immediately after the last acoustic stimulus. Then was performed intracardiac perfusion, the animals had their bullae removed and cochleas were processed for scanning electron microscopy. In relation to the DPOAE, the animals of the group WAR-kindling showed a significant difference in the signal-to-noise ratio, with WAR pre-kindling animals having values significantly higher than those of the post-kindling group. In relation to ABR there was a significant difference, the WAR-kindling group presented values significantly higher than those in the Wistar kindling group. By scanning electron microscopy in WAR they were observed irregular structural bundles of stereocilia of Outer <b>Hair</b> <b>Cells</b> (OHC) and Inner <b>Hair</b> <b>Cells</b> (IHC). The tests for assessing auditory function by means of DPOAE and electrophysiology (ABR) associated with the scanning electron microscopy allowed to characterize the morphological and functional changes in internal and <b>external</b> <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> of the inner ear in animals with acoustic stimulation in WAR after audiogenic kindling.

40|$|Prestin, {{the motor}} protein {{of the outer}} <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> in the organ of Corti in the inner ear, {{plays a crucial role}} in the {{sensitivity}} of hearing due to its role in mechano-sensoric transduction. Up to today, the molecular regulatory mechanisms of prestin expression are still not completely understood. In this study, mRNA expression of prestin and the transcription factors Pou 4 f 3 (POU domain, class 4, transcription factor 3), C/ebpβ (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta), Sp 1 (specificity protein 1), Carf (calcium response factor) and Creb 1 (cAMP response element binding protein) in rats were measured with the help of Real-Time-PCR, applying different experimental conditions, and referring to two reference systems. The total concentration of RNA in one sample and the concentration of mRNA of the housekeeping gene Tbp were used as independent reference systems. The expression of prestin and the transcription factors investigated in this study were compared for: 1. the pattern of expression; 2. the correlation between mRNA concentrations; and 3. the existence of binding sites for the selected transcription factors in promoter regions of prestin and of the transcription factors. The chosen conditions in this study are known to have an impact on the expression of prestin. These are firstly the changes during postnatal development in rats between the 2 nd and 8 th day. Secondly, expression changes were induced specifically in the organotypic culture of the organ of Corti. For this purpose, the culture was modified by adding thyroxin (T 4), potassium chloride (KCl), and sodium butyrate (SB), or retinoic acid (RA) respectively, in various concentrations. In addition, the search was done for expression changes along the apical-basal axis of the organ of Corti. This work shows the significant correlation between mRNA expression of prestin and Pou 4 f in the postnatal development and furthermore in the organotypic culture with the addition of thyroxin (0. 5 µM), sodium butyrate (up to 2000 µM), and increased potassium chloride (KCl) concentrations (50 mM). Furthermore, both genes show an apical-basal gradient along the apical-basal axis of the organ of Corti in the postnatal development as well as in the 48 h culture with the addition of thyroxin (0. 5 mM). Another significant correlation was demonstrated between the expression of C/ebp and prestin in the postnatal development and in the 48 h culture after adding thyroxin (0. 5 mM) and retinoic acid (up to 100 µM). In addition to that, C/ebp also shows an apical-basal gradient in the organ of Corti in the postnatal development. The expression of the transcription factor Carf correlates with the prestin expression in the organotypic culture with the addition of thyroxin (0. 5 mM) as well as under the condition of applying KCL (50 mM). There were no significant correlations between prestin expression and the transcription factors Sp 1 or Creb 1 a. Using a modified method of preparation, an analysis was performed concerning local differences in the expression of transcription factors in the inner ear between the area of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and the modiolus. It was found that the transcription factors Gata 3 and C/ebpβ are higher expressed in the organ of Corti than in the limbus. Pou 4 f 3 is already known to be expressed specifically in the <b>external</b> <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> of the organ of Corti. Compared to the modiolus, the expression of the transcription factors Sp 1, Carf, and Creb is not increased in the organ of Corti. An in silico analysis of the promoter regions of prestin in human, rat, mouse, and bovine provided evidence for the existence of homologous binding sites for Pou 4 f 3, C/ebpβ, and Carf in these regions. In addition to that, binding sites for retinoic acid and thyroxin are found more frequently in the promoter sequences of prestin rather than in random sequences with identical base composition. These results indicate that the transcription factors Pou 4 f 3, C/ebpβ and Carf are potential candidates for the regulation of prestin expression. Further experimental studies have to be performed to prove the functional relevance of these transcription factors and their binding sites...|$|R

We have developed a chemical screen to identify FDA-approved drugs and biologically active compounds that modulate <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration in zebrafish. Of the 1680 compounds evaluated, we identified two enhancers and six inhibitors of regeneration. The two enhancers, dexamethasone and prednisolone, are synthetic glucocorticoids that potentiated <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> numbers during regeneration and also induced <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> addition {{in the absence of}} damage. BrdU analysis confirmed that the extra <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> arose from mitotic activity. We found that dexamethasone and prednisolone, like other glucocorticoids, suppress zebrafish caudal fin regeneration, indicating that <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration occurs by a distinctly different process. Further analyses of the regeneration inhibitors revealed that two of the six, flubendazole and topotecan, significantly suppress <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration by preventing proliferation of <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> precursors. Flubendazole halted support cell division in M-phase, possibly by interfering with normal microtubule activity. Topotecan, a topoisomerase inhibitor, killed both <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and proliferating <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> precursors. A third inhibitor, fulvestrant, moderately delayed <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration by reducing support cell proliferation.

Inhibition of protein synthesis (via treatment with cycloheximide) increased <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> survival after treatment with neomycin, suggesting that <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> death requires de novo protein synthesis.

[...] University of Washington, 2015 <b>Hair</b> <b>cells</b> are {{required}} for hearing and balance. <b>Hair</b> <b>cell</b> death is caused by multiple environmental insults, such as prolong exposure to loud noises, aminoglycoside antibiotics, some chemotherapeutics, and heavy metals, and <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> loss is irreversible in humans.

How <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> precursors are replenished or maintained throughout the animal’s life is still unknown. I investigated lateral line <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> and support cell maintenance in adult zebrafish, in which growth is largely complete.

I observed that <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> undergo continuous turnover in adult zebrafish in the absence of damage. Mitotically-distinct support cell populations were identified and show that <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> regenerate from underlying support cells in a region-specific manner. Using the transgenic Zebrabow-M fish line, I performed long-term multicolor clonal analysis to discover that lateral line neuromast drift towards clonality. However, I also observe that some neuromasts reach equilibrium and may indicate that multiple progenitors act to maintain the lateral line neuromast. Our results demonstrate that there are distinct support cell populations in the lateral line, which may help explain why zebrafish <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration is extremely robust, retained throughout life, and potentially unlimited in regenerative capacity...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{prevalence}} of hearing loss after {{damage to the}} mammalian cochlea has been thought {{to be due to}} a lack of spontaneous regeneration of <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> the primary receptor cells for sound. Here, we show that supporting <b>cells,</b> which surround <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> in the normal cochlear epithelium, differentiate into new <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> in the neonatal mouse following ototoxic damage. Using lineage tracing, we show that new <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> predominantly outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> arise from Lgr 5 -expressing inner pillar and third Deiters cells and that new <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> generation is increased by pharmacological inhibition of Notch. These data suggest that the neonatal mammalian cochlea has some capacity for <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration following damage alone and that Lgr 5 -positive <b>cells</b> act as <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> progenitors in the cochlea...|$|R
40|$|Fish {{models are}} {{increasingly}} being used for hearing research investigations. Aminoglycoside antibiotics that are used for damaging the inner ear <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> can have systemic side effects leading to death of study animals. This study aimed to compare two methods: (i) systemic (intravenous) and (ii) local (intrasaccular) gentamicin administration for induction of inner ear <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> damage in the Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua (L.). <b>Hair</b> <b>cell</b> damage was assessed using scanning electron microscopy; <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> density, prevalence of immature <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and kinocilia length were measured. Gentamicin-treated fish were compared with control and sham fish. Intravenous gentamicin led to dose-dependent mortality caused by nephrotoxicity. The only visible effect after treatment was more immature <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and shorter kinocilia, the effect on <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> density was equivocal. Following intrasaccular gentamicin treatment, fish mortality was negligible, and <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> were damaged regardless of dose. Here, we observed decreased <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> density, high prevalence of immature <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> and significantly shortened kinocilia. Conclusion: intrasaccular injection is preferable to intravenous injection of gentamicin {{for the study of}} ototoxicity in the Atlantic cod. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{auditory}} epithelium {{in birds}} and mammals consists of a postmitotic population of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and supporting cells. Unlike mammals, birds can regenerate their auditory epithelia after trauma. Recent evidence indicates that supporting cells undergo mitosis after acoustic trauma, suggesting that supporting cells may transdifferentiate into <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> The goals {{of this study were}} to (1) characterize the responses of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and supporting cells to acoustic trauma, and (2) determine whether <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> loss is a prerequisite for generation of new <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Chicks were exposed to an octave-band noise and their inner ears assayed with fluorescence or scanning electron microscopy. In one area of the basilar papilla, defined as the center of the lesion, extensive <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> degeneration occurred. Expanded supporting <b>cells</b> obliterated degenerating <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and invaded spaces normally occupied by <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Aggregates of DNA were found within the basilar papilla, suggesting that <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> death and disintegration may occur within the epithelium. The epithelial sheet appeared structurally confluent at all times examined. Supporting cells exhibited altered apical contour in distal regions of the basilar papilla, where <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> damage was mild or inconspicuous. Four days after noise exposure, newly generated <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> were found {{in the center of the}} lesion and in the distal areas, where no <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> loss could be detected. The results suggest that supporting cells may play an important role in maintenance and repair of the traumatized basilar papilla and raise the possibility that production of new <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> is not dependent on <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> loss in the immediate vicinity...|$|R
40|$|In chickens, nonsensory {{supporting}} cells {{divide and}} regenerate auditory <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> after injury. Anatomical {{evidence suggests that}} supporting cells can also transdifferentiate into <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> without dividing. In this study, we characterized an organ culture model to study auditory <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration, and we used these cultures to test if direct transdifferentiation alone can lead to significant <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration. Control cultures (organs from posthatch chickens maintained without streptomycin) showed complete <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> loss in the proximal (high-frequency) region by 5  days. In contrast, a 2 -day treatment with streptomycin induced loss of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> from all regions by 3  days. <b>Hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration proceeded in culture, with {{the time course of}} supporting <b>cell</b> division and <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation generally resembling in vivo patterns. The degree of supporting cell division depended upon the presence of streptomycin, the epithelial region, the type of culture media, and serum concentration. On average, 87 % of the regenerated <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> lacked the cell division marker BrdU despite its continuous presence, suggesting that most <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> were regenerated via direct transdifferentiation. Addition of the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin to culture media prevented supporting cell division, but numerous <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> were regenerated nonetheless. These <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> showed signs of functional maturation, including stereociliary bundles and rapid uptake of FM 1 - 43. These observations demonstrate that direct transdifferentiation is a significant mechanism of <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration in the chicken auditory after streptomycin damage in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Cochlear <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and the {{stria vascularis}} are {{critical}} for normal hearing. <b>Hair</b> <b>cells</b> transduce mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, whereas the stria is responsible for generating the endocochlear potential (EP), which {{is the driving force}} for <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> mechanotransduction. We questioned whether <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and the stria interdepend for survival by using two mouse models. Atoh 1 conditional knockout mice, which lose all <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> within four weeks after birth, were used to determine whether the absence of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> would affect function and survival of stria. We showed that stria morphology and EP remained normal for long time despite a complete loss of all <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> We then used a mouse model that has an abnormal stria morphology and function due to mutation of the Mitf gene to determine whether <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> are able to survive and transduce sound signals without a normal electrochemical environment in the endolymph. A strial defect, reflected by missing intermediate cells in the stria and by reduction of EP, led to systematic outer <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> death from the base to the apex after postnatal day 18. However, an 18 -mV EP was sufficient for outer <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> survival. Surprisingly, inner <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> survival was less vulnerable to reduction of the EP. Our studies show that normal function of the stria is essential for adult outer <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> survival, while the survival and normal function of the stria vascularis do not depend on functional <b>hair</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|During the {{development}} of the mammalian inner ear, the number of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> produced is highly regulated and remains constant throughout life. The mechanism underlying this regulation is beginning to be understood although many aspects still remain obscure. When late embryonic or early postnatal rat organs of Corti were cultured, the production of supernumerary <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> was observed. This overproduction of sensory cells could be modulated by the addition of several growth factors. In this study, we examined explants of rat organs of Corti that produced supernumerary <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> In the supernumerary <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> region, up to two rows of inner <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and five rows of outer <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> were observed. Morphological evaluation of these specimens revealed that less mature <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> were located in the most external rows of these sensory cells. When a supernumerary <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> was produced, a supporting cell (i. e. Deiters' cell) was also produced, strongly suggesting that the conversion of a Deiters' <b>cell</b> into a <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> was not the mechanism that produced these extra <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Based on these results, we propose that prosensory cells located at the external edge of the organ of Corti retain a capacity to form <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and that it is these prosensory cells that differentiate into supernumerary <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and Deiters' cells.

40|$|We {{developed}} a transgenic mouse to permit conditional and selective ablation of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> {{in the adult}} mouse utricle by inserting the human diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) gene into the Pou 4 f 3 gene, which encodes a hair cell-specific transcription factor. In adult wild-type mice, administration of diphtheria toxin (DT) caused no significant <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> loss. In adult Pou 4 f 3 �/DTR mice, DT treatment reduced <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> numbers to 6 % of normal by 14 days post-DT. Remaining <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> were located primarily in the lateral extrastriola. Over time, <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> numbers increased in these regions, reaching 17 % of untreated Pou 4 f 3 �/DTR mice by 60 days post-DT. Replacement <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> were morphologically distinct, with multiple cytoplasmic processes, and displayed evidence for active mechanotransduction channels and synapses characteristic of type II <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> Three lines of evidence suggest replacement <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> were derived via direct (nonmitotic) transdifferentiation of supporting cells: new <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> did not incorporate BrdU, supporting cells upregulated the pro-hair cell gene Atoh 1, and supporting cell numbers decreased over time.

40|$|In humans, most {{hearing loss}} results from death of <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> the mechanosensory receptors {{of the inner}} ear. Two goals of current hearing {{research}} are to protect <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> from degeneration and to regenerate new <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> replacing those that are lost due to aging, disease, or environmental challenges. One limitation {{of research in the}} auditory field has been the relative inaccessibility of the mechanosensory systems in the inner ear. Zebrafish possess <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> in both their inner ear and their lateral line system that are morphologically and functionally similar to human <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> The <b>external</b> location of the mechanosensory <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> in the lateral line and the ease of in vivo labeling and imaging make the zebrafish lateral line a unique system for the study of <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> toxicity, protection, and regeneration. This review focuses on the lateral line system as a model for understanding loss and protection of mechanosensory <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> We discuss chemical screens to identify compounds that induce <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> loss and others that protect <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> from known toxins and the potential application of these screens to human medicine...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{examined}} lateral line <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> and support cell maintenance in adult zebrafish when growth is largely complete. We demonstrate that adult zebrafish not only replenish <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> after a single instance of <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> damage, but also maintain <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> and support cells after multiple rounds of damage and regeneration. We find that <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> undergo continuous turnover in adult zebrafish {{in the absence}} of damage. We identify mitotically-distinct support cell populations and show that <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> regenerate from underlying support cells in a region-specific manner. Our results demonstrate that there are two distinct support cell populations in the lateral line, which may help explain why zebrafish <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> regeneration is extremely robust, retained throughout life, and potentially unlimited in regenerative capacity...|$|R
40|$|Loss {{of sensory}} <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> {{of the inner}} ear due to {{aminoglycoside}} exposure is {{a major cause of}} hearing loss. Using an immortalized multipotent otic progenitor (iMOP) cell line, specific signaling pathways that promote otic cell survival were identified. Of the signaling pathways identified, the PI 3 K pathway emerged as a strong candidate for promoting <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> survival. In aging animals, components for active PI 3 K signaling are present but decrease in <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> In this study, we determined whether activated PI 3 K signaling in <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> promotes survival. To activate PI 3 K signaling in <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> we used a small molecule inhibitor of PTEN or genetically ablated PTEN using a conditional knockout animal. <b>Hair</b> <b>cell</b> survival was challenged by addition of gentamicin to cochlear cultures. <b>Hair</b> <b>cells</b> with activated PI 3 K signaling were more resistant to aminoglycoside-induced <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> death. These results indicate that increased PI 3 K signaling in <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> promote survival and the PI 3 K signaling pathway is a target for preventing aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hair</b> <b>cells</b> {{possess a}} single primary cilium, called the kinocilium, early in development. While the kinocilium {{is lost in}} {{auditory}} <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> of most species it is maintained in vestibular <b>hair</b> <b>cells.</b> It has generally been believed that the primary role of the kinocilium and cilia-associated genes in <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> is {{in the establishment of}} the polarity of actin-based stereocilia, the <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> mechanotransduction apparatus. Through genetic screening and testing of candidate genes in zebrafish (Danio rerio) we have found that mutations in multiple cilia genes implicated in intraflagellar transport (dync 2 h 1, wdr 35, ift 88, and traf 3 ip), and the ciliary transition zone (cc 2 d 2 a, mks 1, and cep 290) lead to resistance to aminoglycoside-induced <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> death. These genes appear to have differing roles in <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> as mutations in intraflagellar transport genes, but not transition zone genes, lead to defects in kinocilia formation and processes dependent upon <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> mechanotransduction activity. These mutants highlight a novel role of cilia-associated genes in <b>hair</b> <b>cells,</b> and provide powerful tools for further study...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} if {{transforming growth factor alpha}} (TGF alpha) pretreatment protects <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> from aminoglycoside induced injury by modifying their intracellular calcium concentration, we assayed <b>hair</b> <b>cell</b> calcium levels in organ of Corti explants {{both before and}} after aminoglycoside (i. e. neomycin, 10 (- 3) M) exposure either with or without growth factor pretreatment. After TGF alpha (500 ng/ml) treatment, the intracellular calcium level of <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> showed a five-fold increase as compared to the levels observed in the <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> of control cultures. After ototoxin exposure, calcium levels in <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> of control explants showed an increase relative to their baseline levels, while in the presence of growth factors pretreatment, <b>hair</b> <b>cells</b> showed a relative reduction in calcium levels.
