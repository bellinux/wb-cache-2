40|$|DE 4130004 A UPAB: 19930924 The {{press has}} a ram which is driven from two {{parallel}} crankshafts through interconnected links. The mechanism is driven through either of two input shafts. On the working stroke the driving shaft (7) {{is connected to}} the driving gear train through the clutch (28) so that the pinion (6) drives the gears. On the return stroke the clutch (28) is disconnected and the drive is transmitted through the clutch (4) and the shaft (1) which has a <b>driving</b> <b>pinion</b> (2) which has a larger diameter than the <b>driving</b> <b>pinion</b> (6) of the shaft (7).

50|$|The rack {{carries the}} full load of the {{actuator}} directly {{and so the}} <b>driving</b> <b>pinion</b> is usually small, so that the gear ratio reduces the torque required. This force, thus torque, may still be substantial {{and so it is}} common for there to be a reduction gear immediately before this by either a gear or worm gear reduction. Rack gears have a higher ratio, thus require a greater driving torque, than screw actuators.|$|R
40|$|The Deep Space Station (DSS) 64 -m antenna {{elevation}} {{axis drive}} is executed by torquing two bull gears, concentric to the elevation axis, with the output pinions of four gear boxes. These gear boxes have functioned well during the 18 and 11 years, respectively, that the DSS 14, and the DSS 43 and DSS 63 antennas {{have been in}} service. A strange wear pattern gradually developed on the bull gears and <b>driving</b> <b>pinions</b> of all three antennas. These patterns were well developed after 8 years and apparently are intensifying in all instances. The elevation drive gears are described and their wear is compared to the wear of other antenna drive gears. The comparison is perplexing and satisfying explanations {{have not yet been}} made...|$|R
50|$|Locher set out {{to design}} a rack system {{that could be used}} on {{gradients}} as steep as 1 in 2 (50%). The Abt system - the most common rack system in Switzerland at the time - was limited to a maximum gradient of 1 in 4 (25%). Locher showed that on steeper grade, the Abt system was prone to the <b>driving</b> <b>pinion</b> over-riding the rack, causing potentially catastrophic derailments, as predicted by Dr. Abt.To overcome this problem and allow a rack line up the steep sides of Mt. Pilatus, Locher developed a rack system where the rack is a flat bar with symmetrical, horizontal teeth. Horizontal pinions engage the centrally-mounted bar, both driving the locomotive and keeping it centered on the track.|$|R
5000|$|The pulleys on the jackshafts of mills {{or power}} plants were {{frequently}} {{connected to the}} shaft with clutches. For example, in the 1890s, the generating room of the Virginia Hotel in Chicago had two Corliss engines and five dynamos, linked through a jackshaft. Clutches on the jackshaft pulleys allowed {{any or all of}} the dynamos to be driven by either or both of the engines. [...] With the advent of chain-drive vehicles, the term jackshaft was generally applied to the final intermediate shaft in the drive train, either a chain driven shaft <b>driving</b> <b>pinions</b> that directly engaged teeth {{on the inside of the}} rims of the drive wheels, or the output shaft of the transmission/differential that is linked by chain to the drive wheels.|$|R
50|$|The neGcon {{worked by}} means of gears turning the shafts of potentiometers. This system greatly reduced the logic {{required}} in the controller (important at the time) compared to a quadrature encoder-based system by removing the need for self-calibration and converting relative position to absolute position. The center pivot of the neGcon utilized a ring-gear <b>driving</b> a <b>pinion</b> on the shaft of the potentiometer, while the 3 analogue buttons each employed a rack <b>driving</b> similar <b>pinions.</b> These systems were large, with two potentiometers in the left half of the controller for the L shoulder button and center pivot and two potentiometers in the right half of the controller for the Ⅰ and Ⅱ buttons. Lack of space inside the unit precluded an analogue R shoulder button. However, extended use caused the swivel joint to wear.|$|R
50|$|Rack-and-pinion {{elevator}} are {{powered by}} a motor <b>driving</b> a <b>pinion</b> gear.

50|$|The pinion wheels can {{be mounted}} on the same axle as the rail wheels (as in the picture at left), or driven separately. The steam {{locomotives}} on the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company had separate cylinders <b>driving</b> the <b>pinion</b> wheel, as do the 'X' Class locomotives on the Nilgiri Mountain Railway.|$|R
50|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{altering}} {{the speed of the}} gearing two or more pinions of different sizes are provided and arrangements made for shifting the <b>driving</b> chain from <b>pinion</b> to pinion.|$|R
50|$|Rack railway {{switches}} are {{as varied}} as rack railway technologies. Where use of the rack is optional, as on the Zentralbahn in Switzerland or the West Coast Wilderness Railway in Tasmania, {{it is common to}} place turnouts only in relatively flat areas where the rack is not needed. On systems where only the pinion is driven and the conventional rail wheels are idlers, such as the Dolderbahn in Zürich, Štrbské Pleso in Slovakia and the Schynige Platte rack railway, the rack must be continuous through the switch. The Dolderbahn switch works by bending all three rails, an operation that is performed every trip as the two trains pass in the middle. The Štrbské Pleso and Schynige Platte Strub rack system instead relies on a complex set of moving points which assemble the rack in the traversed direction and simultaneously clear the crossed direction conventional rails. In some rack systems, such as the Morgan system, where locomotives always have multiple <b>driving</b> <b>pinions,</b> it is possible to simplify turnouts by interrupting the rack rail, so long as the interruption is shorter than the spacing between the drive pinions on the locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|The {{geometry}} of the rack system has a large impact {{on the construction of}} turnouts. If the rack is elevated above the running rails, {{there is no need to}} interrupt the running rails to allow passage of the <b>driving</b> <b>pinions</b> of the engines. Strub explicitly documented this in his U.S. patent. [...] Strub used a complex set of bell-cranks and push-rods linking the throw-rod for the points to the two throw-rods for the moving rack sections. One break in the rack was required to select between the two routes, and a second break was required where the rack rails cross the running rails. Turnouts for the Morgan Rack system were similar, with the rack elevated above the running rails. Most of the Morgan turnout patents included movable rack sections to avoid breaks in the rack, but because all Morgan locomotives had two linked drive pinions, there was no need for a continuous rack. So long as the breaks in the rack were shorter than the distance between the drive pinions on the locomotive, the rack rail could be interrupted wherever there was need to cross over a running rail.|$|R
50|$|In some {{transmission}} designs (Volvo 850 and V/S70 series, for example) {{there are}} actually two countershafts, both <b>driving</b> an output <b>pinion</b> meshing with the front-wheel-drive transaxle's ring gear. This allows the transmission designer to make the transmission narrower, since each countershaft need only be half {{as long as a}} traditional countershaft with four gears and two shifters.|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part K: Journal of Multi-body Dynamics [© IMECHE]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] transmission gear rattle is an NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness) concern in the automotive industry. It is induced by repetitive impacts on loose (unselected) gear wheel teeth by their corresponding <b>driving</b> <b>pinions.</b> This phenomenon occurs under various loading conditions and is classified accordingly, including ‘idle rattle’ when the transmission is in neutral and ‘creep and drive rattle’ when the transmission is in a gear with a widely open or a partially open throttle. The phenomenon is also present from drive to coast conditions, referred to as overrun rattle. Engine order fluctuations on the input shaft are considered to be the underlying cause for rattle of loose gears. However, the mechanism of transmission of vibration through lubricated contacts is not fundamentally understood. It is surmised that changes in lubricated contact conditions at different bulk oil temperatures may play a key role and, therefore, offer an opportunity to deal with rattle by a root-cause fundamental solution. This means that a detailed multi-physics approach (including dynamics, vibration, and tribology) is needed. This article provides detailed analytical models of lubricated conjunctions in a multi-body dynamics model of a transaxle seven-speed transmission system under creep rattle conditions. The results show the important role of the regime of lubrication in lightly loaded conjunctions, increasing the propensity to rattle at higher temperatures. It is also revealed that the effect of engine order vibration as an initiating source for rattle becomes significant with reduced hydrodynamic contact stiffness at rising temperatures...|$|R
50|$|A second free-turning pinion wheel {{which also}} meshed with the rack, was {{mounted on the}} leading driving axle. It had grooved brake drums bolted to each side and acted as a brake only, with the brakes being applied by a hand {{mechanism}} from the footplate. The brakes on the <b>driving</b> and free-turning <b>pinion</b> wheels were separately controlled, while the vacuum brake gear on the engine was only used to control the brakes of the train.|$|R
50|$|The rack {{locomotive}} had plate frames, arranged outside the coupled wheels, and {{was equipped with}} the Heusinger von Waldegg version of Walschaerts valve gear. The pinion for the rack was mounted between the coupled wheels, just forward of the <b>driving</b> axle. The <b>pinion</b> axle was coupled to the drivers through side rods, with the connecting rods coupled directly to crank disks which were mounted {{on the ends of}} the axle, outside the frames. These crank disks were grooved to act as brake drums.|$|R
25|$|The {{locomotive}} pinions {{engage the}} rack and {{provide all the}} traction and braking effort; the wheels are free to revolve on the drive axles, {{to allow for the}} inevitable difference between the wheel radius and the effective radius of the pinion. The wheels serve only to support and guide the vehicle; if the pinion were missing, handbrake on and locomotive crank locked, the vehicle would still roll down the mountain. (The wheels are not capable of providing useful adhesion on such a gradient, so this is not the disadvantage it might seem.) The two <b>driving</b> axle <b>pinions</b> on a locomotive are mounted with a half a pitch difference between them. Combined with the half pitch difference in the two rack bars, this feature aims to make the transfer of power more continuous, and thus smooth the hauling of the train. In spite of this, the vehicles still suffer from very high levels of vibration.|$|R
40|$|This book {{chapter is}} closed access. The {{internal}} combustion engine produces a fluctuating torque due to combustion as well as induced inertial imbalance in the reciprocating motion of pistons. When the clutch is engaged, the resulting torsional oscillations of the crankshaft are transmitted to the transmission. In the transmission the fixed <b>driving</b> gears (<b>pinions)</b> transfer the motion to the driven unselected gears (loose gears) through impacting teeth pairs in close proximity due to the compact nature of modern transmission systems. The driven gears in turn rotate freely on their bearings, as they are unselected (referred to as loose gears). As a result, the idle (loose) gears oscillate within their backlash limits, leading to impacts with the driving gears. The vibrations caused by these impacts are transferred through the transmission shafts and their support bearings to the transmission bell housing, and is mostly radiated as sound that resembles the noise produced when a marble rolls inside a metallic can. This sound is onomatopoeically referred to as rattle...|$|R

50|$|The jacking {{gear motor}} is {{designed}} to rotate the shaft at approximately 1/10rpm. Most jacking gear motors are rated at 5hp.

5000|$|For the He 177, Günter {{decided to}} employ {{two of the}} complex Daimler-Benz DB 606 [...] "power system" [...] setups for propulsion. He had already {{employed}} these engines on the record-breaking Heinkel He 119 reconnaissance aircraft prototypes. They consisted {{of a pair of}} DB 601 liquid-cooled 12-cylinder inverted-vee inline engines mounted side by side in a nacelle - for the He 119, centrally within the fuselage, just behind its heavily glazed cockpit enclosure - driving one propeller. The two engines were inclined inwards by 30° when mounted onto either side of their common, vertical-plane space-frame primary engine mount, so that the inner cylinder banks were disposed almost vertically. A common gear-housing connected the front ends of the two crankcases, with the two crankshaft <b>pinions</b> <b>driving</b> a single airscrew shaft gear. The outer sides of each of the component engines' crankcases were connected to the nacelle firewall through forged mountings similar to what would be used for either a single DB 601 or DB 605 engine-powered aircraft installation. When combined with the central space-frame mount designed especially for the [...] "power system" [...] format, this resulted in a Daimler-Benz [...] "coupled" [...] twin-crankcase [...] "power system" [...] having a trio of engine mount structures within its nacelle accommodation. The starboard DB 601 component engine had to be fitted with a mirror-image version of its mechanically driven centrifugal supercharger, drawing air from the starboard side of the engine. Two of the DB 606s, each of which initially developed 2,600 PS (2,564 hp, 1,912 kW) for take-off and weighing some 1,515 kg (3,340 lb) apiece, were to power the He 177. The DB 606 — and its eventual replacement, the Daimler-Benz DB 605-based [...] "DB 610" [...] — were to be the only two production German aviation powerplants designed to surpass 1,500 kW of power, something that the Germans had considerable challenges in developing during the war into production-ready, combat-reliable aviation engines.|$|R
