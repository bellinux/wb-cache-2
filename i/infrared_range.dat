25|$|The {{coherence}} and low divergence angle of laser light, aided by focusing from {{the lens of}} an eye, can cause laser radiation to be concentrated into an extremely small spot on the retina. A transient increase of only 10 °C can destroy retinal photoreceptor cells. If the laser is sufficiently powerful, permanent damage can occur within {{a fraction of a}} second, literally faster than the blink of an eye. Sufficiently powerful lasers in the visible to near <b>infrared</b> <b>range</b> (400-1400nm) will penetrate the eyeball and may cause heating of the retina, whereas exposure to laser radiation with wavelengths less than 400nm and greater than 1400nm are largely absorbed by the cornea and lens, leading to the development of cataracts or burn injuries.|$|E

500|$|For all {{of their}} efficiency, atomic line filters are not perfect; there are many sources of error, or [...] "noise", in a given system. These are {{manifest}} as electromagnetic radiation independent of the working processes of the filter {{and the intensity of}} the signal light. One source of error is the thermal radiation of and within the ALF itself. Some thermal radiation comes directly from the filter and happens to be within the bandpass of the second broad band filter.

Furthermore, great importance is given to closing eyelids and covering the location of the eyes as temporary and permanent flash blindness is a risk potential without this covering, especially at night. A photograph taken about 1.3km from the hypocenter of the Hiroshima bomb explosion showed that the shadowing effect of leaves from a nearby shrub protected a wooden utilities pole from charring discoloration due to the burst of thermal radiation, however the rest of the telephone pole, not under the protection of the leaves, was charred almost completely black.|$|E
