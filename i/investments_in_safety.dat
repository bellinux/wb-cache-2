50|$|Information {{asymmetry}} has {{a significant}} negative effect on most insurance environments, where typical considerations include inability to distinguish between users of different (high and low risk) types, i.e., the so-called adverse selection problem, as well as users undertaking actions that adversely affect loss probabilities after the insurance contract is signed, i.e., the so-called moral hazard problem. The challenge due to the interdependent and correlated nature of cyber-risks is particular to cyber-insurance and differentiates traditional insurance scenarios (e.g., car or health insurance) from the former. In a large distributed system such as the Internet, risks span a large set of nodes and are correlated. Thus, user investments in security to counter risks generate positive externalities for other users in the network. The aim of cyber-insurance here is to enable individual users to internalize the externalities in the network so that each user optimally invests in security solutions, thereby alleviating moral hazard and improving network security. In traditional insurance scenarios, the risk span is quite small (sometimes it spans {{only one or two}} entities) and uncorrelated, thus internalizing the externalities generated by user <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>safety,</b> is much easier.|$|E

We show that access to an insurance market in most situations will influence <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> measures. For an expected utility maximizer, an overinvestment in safety measures is likely if access to an insurance market is ignored, while an underinvestment in safety measures is likely if insurance is purchased without paying attention to the possibility for reducing the probability and/or consequences of an accidental event by safety measures...|$|E

In economic optimizations of risk control measures, valuing the loss of life and other financial losses in terms of money on the other hand, could influence the optimal <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>safety.</b> The purpose is to contribute to the implementation of HSE in the transportation system. In this research, a fire risk assessment along with its economic loss estimation in the Direct Current (DC) trains and rectifier substation (RS) of Tehran subway is implemented. The number of fatalities, the extent of damage on the train equipment, etc., is then calculated in monetary unit. By using Event Tree Analysis (herein ETA), after identification of initiating events through observation, interviews, and evaluation of documents, event tree was constructed for each of them and the probability of multiple scenarios were computed. The scenario with the highest probability of fire in RS, including increased heats in the RTU panels generate a loss of at least 730 Million Rials. Accordingly, the minimum and maximum economic loss caused by fire on DC trains is minimum 510 and 1230 Million Rials, respectively. Conclusion: Given the findings of this study, the financial and human life risks, along with all tangible and intangible losses, which is considerable, the relevant managers must compare <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>safety,</b> with the decrease of calculated economic risks as a result of fire accident in Tehran subway...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of decision analytical methods to {{the evaluation of}} <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> fire <b>safety</b> was investigated, particularly {{with the aim of}} being able to suggest a method for analysing a specific <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> fire <b>safety</b> for a specific factory. Attention was directed above all at the handling of cases of large epistemic uncertainty regarding both probabilities and utilities, Bayesian decision theory serving as a basis {{for the development of the}} method.

As a problem area not well-developed in the literature but considered a crucial force influencing hotel firms ’ value by the multinational hotel community, safety {{and security}} provide an excellent opportunity for industry professionals and academic researchers to improve the value creation of multinational hotel firms. A research need is more urgent in the upscale sector of the industry, and thus, an upscale brand of multinational hotel firm was selected for this study. This case study investigated how a multinational hotel firm developed a process of valuing its <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> and security for its properties under an upscale brand.

40|$|Posted with {{permission}} from FDLI; Food and Drug Law Journal Various proposals have been advanced in response to recent problems with the safety of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved drugs. Many call for incremental change, such as new safety oversight bodies or minor expansions of FDA's existing powers. "Fixing" FDA may not fix the problem, without related reform of the broader legal framework in which FDA operates. Key reform challenges include promoting clinical compliance with important safety warnings while preserving needed flexibility for physicians to adapt drug use to the individual patient; developing a clearer distinction between pre- and postapproval safety regulation; and devising mechanisms for funding <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> improvements.

In this paper we present the results of some initial analysis of data on individual employer claims experience – the first time that data at this more disaggregated, micro level has been examined to address this research question. Our initial analysis of individual firms ’ workers ’ compensation experience suggests that experience rating does have the intended effect of encouraging employers to improve safety.

40|$|We {{learn about}} a product’s safety profile through the {{experience}} of others. Because adverse effects {{are more likely to}} be discovered the greater the users of a product, consumption of potentially dangerous products generates a positive externality. The obvious problem in estimating consumption externalities in safety is that if there are consumption externalities greater consumption makes products safer. But consumers prefer safer products so safer products are likely to be consumed by more people. So is greater consumption a cause of safety, an effect of safety, or both a cause and effect? We take advantage of a quasi-experiment to estimate the effect of consumption externalities on safety by estimating the impact of a change in consumer preferences for safety generated by a ban on the right to sue the product’s manufacturer. In 1994 congress passed the General Aviation Revitalization Act (GARA). GARA cut off the right to sue the manufacturer of any plane 18 years or older. The law effectively moved any general aviation aircraft over 18 years of age from a regime of strict liability to one of no liability.

40|$|Theories of tort {{liability}} generally {{fall within}} two broad camps: the instrumentalists claim that tort liability promotes efficient <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> by cutting into the revenues {{of those who}} under-invest in safety; and the advocates of corrective justice claim that tort liability embodies a moral obligation of culpable parties to bear losses {{for which they are}} fairly considered responsible. Neither theory offers much support for government tort liability. Unlike private tortfeasors, the government’s objective is not profit maximization; it responds to political and not market discipline. Thus, the instrumental justification for tort liability is wanting in the public sector. As for corrective justice, the government passes its legal costs along to the taxpayers, who bear little if any culpability for the underlying tortious conduct. Thus, corrective justice also supplies little support for public-sector tort liability. Indeed, there is an emerging consensus among legal scholars that government tort liability lacks a coherent justification. In this article, I endeavor to show that the emerging consensus is wrong. To do so, I anchor the justification for government tort liability in a theory of political behavior. I look to politics because the government responds primarily to political costs and benefits, whereas private tortfeasors respond primarily to economic rewards or punishment. In my view, government tort liability exacts a political price by diverting the funds used to pay judgments and other litigation costs from what elected officials regard as the politically optimal use of those funds. Therefore, government liability creates a political incentive to invest in loss prevention in order to maximize political control over public resources. This theory, however, does not argue for unlimited government liability; to the contrary, it also provide a justification for many of the immunities that limit government liability...|$|E

Section II is new and highlights the Panel's view of NASA's safety progress during the year. Section III contains the pivotal safety issues facing NASA in the coming year. Section IV includes the program area findings and recommendations. The Panel has been asked by the Administrator to perform several special studies this year, and the resulting white papers appear in Appendix C. The year has been filled with significant achievements for NASA in both successful Space Shuttle operations and International Space Station (ISS) construction. Throughout the year, safety has been first and foremost in spite of many changes throughout the Agency. The relocation of the Orbiter Major Modifications (OMMs) from California to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) appears very successful. The transition of responsibilities for program management of the Space Shuttle and ISS programs from Johnson Space Center (JSC) to NASA Headquarters went smoothly. The decision to extend the life of the Space Shuttle as the primary NASA vehicle for access to space is viewed by the Panel as a prudent one. With the appropriate <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> improvements, in maintenance, in preserving appropriate inventories of spare parts, and in infrastructure, the Space Shuttle can provide safe and reliable support for the ISS for the foreseeable future. Indications of an aging Space Shuttle fleet occurred {{on more than one occasion}} this year. Several flaws went undetected in the early prelaunch tests and inspections. In all but one case, the problems were found prior to launch. These incidents were all handled properly and with safety as the guiding principle. Indeed, launches were postponed until the problems were fully understood and mitigating action could be taken. These incidents do, however, indicate the need to analyze the Space Shuttle certification criteria closely. Based on this analysis, NASA can determine the need to receritfy the vehicles and to incorporate more stringent inspections throughout the process to minimize launch schedule impact. A highly skilled and experience workforce will be increasingly important for safe and reliable operations as the Space Shuttle vehicles and infrastructure continue to age...|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{has a reputation}} as one of the most unsafe industries because of its high incident, injury and fatality rates. With the increasing attention paid to the occupational health and safety (OHS) issues, an effective safety management system (SMS) becomes one of the most important aspects in construction project management. Furthermore the high cost of construction incidents was also a main driving force behind the industry's safety movement. However, unlike investing in IT or real estate development projects which will tangibly benefit the companies by selling products such as software and properties, the benefits of inputting resources into safety management cannot be measured easily in physical terms, and it might take years before the benefits of investing <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> management could be realized. In addition, the expenses of safety management often seem very exorbitant, hence safety management systems have been considered as non-returnable investments that were not of benefit to anyone. This misunderstanding widely exists among construction project stakeholders. Therefore, the development of an accurate and comprehensive cost-benefit analysis technique of construction safety management was becoming essential. The aim of this research was to develop an objective and quantitative measure to analyse the return on investment (ROI) of SMS in construction project management. The model developed in this research was applied to actual projects to prove its validity and applicability. By carrying out the thorough literature review, the ROI model was developed with three main components: measuring the efficiency of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> management systems; determining the costs of construction incidents and evaluating the tangible benefits; and measuring the <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> SMS. By applying the model in Australia using data of safety performance of actual projects, the economic benefits were identified and proved to be effective. Effective SMS could eliminate incidents, injuries and fatalities, and then consequently lead to a significant savings on reduced number of incidents and injuries, hence had considerable significance to the project client and contractor. <b>Investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> management could also bring benefits such as reducing interruptions, improving productivity and product quality, and enhancing a company's image and reputation. In general, the main contribution of this research was that the tangible benefits were measured through a series of objective methods based on the data of real cases, rather than through subjective methods such as interviews or surveys. The methodology adopted in this research was objective and rigorous, which ensured the accuracy and credibility of the research findings.

40|$|The {{differences}} between Professor Whitford 2 ̆ 7 s views and mine are of crucial {{importance to the}} law of products liability. Our objectives—indeed, the objectives of all interested in the field—are similar: to identify policies that, other things equal, will reduce the seriousness and frequency of injuries suffered by consumers. Professor Whitford and I differ sharply, however, in our predictions of the empirical effects of modern products liability policy. According to Professor Whitford, the policy adopted by courts over the last twenty years—the expansion of manufacturer liability beyond that undertaken in warranties—is likely to have reduced the rate of product defects. According to my investment theory, on the other hand, if consumer and manufacturer <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> are substitutes at the margin, the expansion of manufacturer liability is likely to have increased the rate of defects and the rate of consumer injuries. The vast number of product-related injuries compels us to examine these different implications very carefully. It is estimated that in 1977 alone, for example, consumers in the United States suffered 36 million product-related injuries. Professor Whitford 2 ̆ 7 s criticism of my article rests upon a misunderstanding of the nature of scientific reasoning. Whitford demands that my investment theory, as a 2 ̆ 2 complete 2 ̆ 2 theory, explain every phenomenon associated with product warranties and directly refute every conceivable alternative warranty theory. These requirements allow Whitford to confer significance upon his assortment of 2 ̆ 2 partial 2 ̆ 2 theories, though he presents no evidence supporting any of them, and to dismiss the investment theory, though he acknowledges the substantial evidence supporting it. Whitford 2 ̆ 7 s typology of theories is unique, and his standard of scientific proof is unrealistic. I know of no scientific theory that has ever met such a standard, and doubt that any theory ever will. More importantly, however, Whitford 2 ̆ 7 s methodological strategem diverts attention from the empirical issue dividing us that ought to be the central focus of product liability reform: whether there is evidence that consumer and manufacturer investments in optimizing productive services are substitutes over the range relevant to legal liability. The answer to this question and to this question alone will determine whether modern developments in products liability law have increased or decreased the rate of product defects and injuries...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{includes}} {{a brief description}} of some closely related ongoing research activities aiming at learning from failures in order to improve the resilience of the Swedish railway system. One of these activities includes the development of a method aiming at assessing the capability for restoring the service of the railway system after strains affecting its technical, and often highly interdependent, elements. In the event of incidents affecting these technical elements, adequate capability of those actors responsible for restoring the system is important. The method is based on a systems approach, and builds on evaluation of a number of incidents that have occurred on a section of the Swedish railway system in workshop sessions, involving persons with substantial knowledge and experience from recovery operations. By varying these incidents by so-called counterfactual scenarios the capability to return to normal operation after different types and magnitudes of strain can be demonstrated. Hence, the method is useful for evaluating the preparedness for future incidents affecting the railway system. Another study where a similar starting point is used, but where a wider spectrum of serious incidents and accidents form the basis for analysis, is a study focusing on the ability to learn from accidents that have stricken the railway system. Incidents and accidents, and in particular the subsequent accident investigation reports that are issued by the accident investigation boards in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, are studied in order to evaluate their potential for enhancing implementation of lessons learned. Although still in its initial stage, the preliminary results from the study indicate that problems for example stemming from the difficulties in knowledge transfer between different hierarchical levels in society influence the process of learning from accidents. The third study presented in this paper aims at describing the decision making process regarding <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> measures in railway tunnel projects. The study is based on interviews with persons involved in six Swedish railway tunnel projects comprising a total of 28 tunnels. The actors involved in the decision making process have considerably different points of departure, which at least in some of the studied projects {{has proven to be a}} reason for discussions and disagreements regarding the design of different safety measures. The results from this study show that substantial resources are invested in safety measures in all of the studied projects. However, the study also indicate that there is a need for increased coordination between the different authorities and organizational levels involved in the projects, and that the experience transfer between different projects can be improved. The three case studies are illustrated in an analytical framework that can be used as a basis for further studies, and it can be concluded that the different approaches are valuable in order to improve the resilience of the Swedish railway system...|$|E
40|$|Elkem has got {{smelting}} plants worldwide. Five of {{them are}} located in Norway. Smelting of metal takes place in electrical arc furnaces, for example, in Elkem Thamshavn. The electrical arc occurs between furnace electrodes and furnace charge. Thereby it causes a melting (Schei, Tuset, & Tveit, 1998), (Elkem AS, 2016 a). Elkem smelting plants have many working areas with potential hazards related to the personnel which refer to current, high temperatures, amount of energy concentrations etc. Due to its industry specialty, smelting industry needs tailored standards. Therefore, a need {{for the implementation of}} the methodology appeared. It should identify critical areas that could be a starting point {{in the development of a}} standard. The assessment of working areas’ criticality regarding to low voltage will be in focus in this thesis. Identification of such critical areas is an important task, since management can prioritize the areas that have been identified (Aven, 2009). A common definition of criticality is following (Aven, 2009, p. 404) : “A system is considered critical if its failure or malfunctions may results in severe consequences”. The consequences can involve environmental damage, loss of lives, etc. By identification of critical areas it can be identified how one can distribute resources and activities concerning <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> and risk reducing measures (Aven, 2009). What kind of tool will be the best to use in this case? Is it the best to use methods that are well established as, for example, risk matrix or is it more useful to introduce other tools? The selection of methods in many cases depends on the available historical data. By using the available data, the following sources were found: -	Information from external sources, for instance, Accident statistic from Norwegian Directorate for Civil Protection [DSB] did not contain required information. -	Data from internal sources, as Synergi Life database, were limited. Risk matrix is a widespread tool in many companies and it is used for qualitative risk assessment. However, it is a tool with limitations (Flage & Røed, 2012). Issues related to the risk matrix, among other things are the subjective classification of the probability and consequence, the consistency between quantitative measures and risk matrix, etc. Thus, risk matrix is used to performing a crude risk analysis and cannot be used alone for decision-making. It is questionable whether this method will be the best option for smelting industry. Thus, an alternative approach may be suggested. It is related to expected values and uncertainties in underlying phenomena and processes (Aven, 2009). This alternative approach does not need a large amount of data and can be applied for ranking a few areas. For instance, it could be used to identify top five most critical working areas. Using of this ranking tool requires high knowledge related to smelting plants and the actual process. It is clear, that by including the uncertainty in the assessment of criticality the accuracy of the results will be higher. Nevertheless, the approach suggested by Aven (2009) needs some adjustments before it can be used in practice. For instance, when different areas have the same type of consequences but probabilities P (A) is different or when some areas have the same type of uncertainties but different probabilities. In such cases, there is not a straight way forward how to rank the actual areas. In addition, the alternative method for identification of critical areas was introduced in 2009. Since then there have been new studies related to this approach. Goerlandt and Reniers (2015) introduce how the assessment of uncertainties can be improved. Moreover, Aven (2013) showed the different new risk perspectives, inter alia, uncertainties based risk definitions in real-life situations. The risk description done in this way has a great impact on risk management and decision-making (Aven, 2009). In light of new research the alternative approach could be modified. The suggested improvement are as following: -	Insert the colors for assessment of risk indices expressing the expected consequences. -	Use the improved classification scheme for uncertainties. -	Include the assessment of knowledge in risk assessment. Since the focus was to develop a method for identifying the critical areas for own workers and contractors, the results will be hypothetical...|$|E

40|$|The risk of food {{insecurity}} due {{to climate change}} in developing countries has encouraged development partners to seek new approaches to improve the resilience of subsistence agriculture to covariate shocks. Such innovative approaches include <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> nets such as rainfall insurance. However, a policy question remains: How does one determine the practicality of rainfall insurance for a particular district? This paper attempts to fill this gap by assessing the viability of rainfall insurance contracts for agricultural production in Ghana’s Northern Region. Using a stop-loss framework, an optimal contract is determined by choosing its parameters by maximizing the objective function {{in the form of}} covariance between crop loss and indemnity payment, the objective function given a predetermined fair premium rate. The theoretical contract is implemented using monthly rainfall and annual maize crop yield data from 1998 to 2004 from 12 districts in the Northern Region under varying premium rates. We conclude that rainfall insurance may not be viable for all districts in the Northern Region; however, the contracts are likely to be viable in districts that exhibit a positive Pearson correlation coefficient between maize yield loss and indemnity payments.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{has a reputation}} as one of the most unsafe industries in terms of high incident, injury and fatality rates. A successful Safety Risk Management System (SRMS) can reduce accident rates and protect construction company's physical, organizational and human capitals, hence bring benefit to the project and the company. However, unlike <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> IT or real estate projects which will benefit the firm by selling products such as software and properties, the benefits of inputting money and human resources into safety management cannot be measured easily in tangible and physical terms. In addition, the prior expenses on accident risk prevention measures and approaches always seem very expensive, hence safety risk management system has been considered as a non-returnable investment that is not of benefit to anyone. This misunderstanding widely exists among construction contractors and clients. This paper aims to develop a quantitative measurement model to analyse the return on investment (ROI) of safety risk management systems in construction projects. The model introduced in this research was validated by a case study using data acquired from a real project. Through this study, the economic benefit of a SRMS has been expressed in monetary values hence the stakeholders of construction projects will have a better understanding of the significance and value of (aka return on) <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>safety</b> risk management <b>in</b> construction...|$|R
