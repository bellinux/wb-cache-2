40|$|Dagger-compact {{categories}} {{have been}} proposed as a categorical framework suitable for quantum reasoning [1, LiCS’ 04]. Modelling classical operations in this framework seemed to require additional completeness assumptions, most notably biproducts. In the present paper, we show that classical operations naturally arise from the quantum structures, with no additional assumptions. Formally, the distinct capabilities of clas-sical data – {{that they can be}} copied and deleted – are captured by means of special coalgebra structures of classical objects. Conceptually, this suggests that the connec-tion of the classical and the quantum reasoning extends the connection of the classical and the resource sensitive logics. Technically, the connection of the classical and the quantum structures thus echoes the connection of the additive and the multiplicative connectives in Linear Logic. In this familiar conceptual framework, we propose a com-prehensive formulation of axioms of quantum informatics, which essentially improves on previous work. The underlying <b>graphic</b> <b>calculus</b> allows a very succinct presenta-tion of several quantum informatic protocols. The underlying structural analysis also provides the elements of an abstract stochastic calculus, and points towards possible refinements of resource sensitive logics, which arise from the quantitative content of quantum mechanics and the limited observability of quantum data. 2...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} ict-tools {{is that they}} do things more neatly and quickly than we could do by hand, and that they do not mind correcting errors. These machines entail less work and more time for things like thinking and learning. If that were all the advantage would be undeniable. For education however an ict-tool should do more, it should benefit and promote thinking and learning. A graphics program for educational purposes should offer more than a simple plotting of graphics. For instance the parameter. The concept of a parameter is difficult to grasp for students in secondary schools. The dynamic use of a parameter that is possible in modern software, however is a great help for students getting a good idea of the concept of parameter and in a way they like. In the Netherlands the publishers of about 90 % of the schoolbooks have the program VUGrafiek (<b>Graphic</b> <b>Calculus,</b> Graphe) provided within the books, so every student can use it both in school and at home. The program is a help for students of different ages with the visualisation, explanation and conceptualisation of mathematical concepts. The main issues of the program will be shown and some recent classroom experiences will be presented...|$|E
40|$|This thesis studies matter {{emergent}} as topological excitations {{of quantum}} geometry in quantum gravity models. In these models, states are framed four-valent spin networks {{embedded in a}} topological three manifold, and the local evolution moves are dual Pachner moves. We first formulate our theory of embedded framed four-valent spin networks by proposing a new <b>graphic</b> <b>calculus</b> of these networks. With this <b>graphic</b> <b>calculus,</b> we study the equivalence classes {{and the evolution of}} these networks, and find what we call 3 -strand braids, as topological excitations of embedded four-valent spin networks. Each 3 -strand braid consists of two nodes that share three edges {{that may or may not}} be braided and twisted. The twists happen to be in units of 1 / 3. Under certain stability condition, some 3 -strand braids are stable. Stable braids have rich dynamics encoded in our theory by dual Pachner moves. Firstly, all stable braids can propagate as induced by the expansion and contraction of other regions of their host spin network under evolution. Some braids can also propagate actively, in the sense that they can exchange places with substructures adjacent to them in the graph under the local evolution moves. Secondly, two adjacent braids may have a direct interaction: they merge under the evolution moves to form a new braid if one of them falls into a class called actively interacting braids. The reverse of a direct interaction may happen too, through which a braid decays to another braid by emitting an actively interacting braid. Thirdly, two neighboring braids may exchange a virtual actively interacting braid and become two different braids, in what is called an exchange interaction. Braid dynamics implies an analogue between actively interacting braids and bosons. We also invent a novel algebraic formalism for stable braids. With this new tool, we derive conservation laws from interactions of the braid excitations of spin networks. We show that actively interacting braids form a noncommutative algebra under direction interaction. Each actively interacting braid also behaves like a morphism on non-actively interacting braids. These findings reinforce the analogue between actively interacting braids and bosons. Another important discovery is that stable braids admit seven, and only seven, discrete transformations that uniquely correspond to analogues of C, P, T, and their products. Along with this finding, a braid's electric charge appears to be a function of a conserved quantity, effective twist, of the braids, and thus is quantized in units of 1 / 3. In addition, each $CPT$-multiplet of actively interacting braids has a unique, characteristic non-negative integer. Braid interactions turn out to be invariant under C, P, and T. Finally, we present an effective description, based on Feynman diagrams, of braid dynamics. This language manifests the analogue between actively interacting braids and bosons, as the topological conservation laws permit them to be singly created and destroyed and as exchanges of these excitations give rise to interactions between braids that are charged under the topological conservation rules. Additionally, we find a constraint on probability amplitudes of braid interactions. We discuss some subtleties, open issues, future directions, and work in progress at the end...|$|E

40|$|This version: 07. 11. 2012 In [5] was {{proposed}} a <b>graphic</b> lambda <b>calculus</b> formalism, which has sectors corre-sponding to untyped lambda calculus and emergent algebras. Here we explore the sector covering knot diagrams, which are constructed as macros over the <b>graphic</b> lambda <b>calculus.</b> 1 Quick introduction and references The <b>graphic</b> lambda <b>calculus</b> [5] is a formalism based on local or global moves acting on locally planar trivalent graphs. In the mentioned paper {{we showed that}} ”sectors ” of this calculus are equivalent with untyped lambda calculus or with emergent algebras. (The formalism of emergent algebras [2] [3] evolved from differential calculus on metric spaces with dilations [1].) For all the relevant notions and results consult [5] for the <b>graphic</b> lambda <b>calculus,</b> [4] for λ-Scale calculus (a first proposal of a calculus containing both untyped lambda calculus and emergent algebras). Those interested in metric spaces with dilations and their applications may consult the course notes [6] on sub-riemannian geometry from intrinsic viewpoint. For a larger view on the half-dreamed subject of ”computing with space ” see [7], where a formalism for emergent algebras based on decorated knot diagrams for emergent algebras {{was proposed}}. There we called ”computing with space ” the various manipulations of these diagrams with geometric content.

40|$|At a {{time when}} schools face {{increasing}} pressures of accountability in both the economic and educational senses, {{there is a growing}} need for teachers to assume the role of evaluators of their own work. This study demonstrates that such a role can serve to fulfil both the specific demands of the teacher and school in assessing the worth of a programme or innovation, and also the wider demands of the educational community, providing practical research data and results which may contribute to the improvement of teaching practice. The study investigates the use of handheld calculators capable of <b>graphics,</b> <b>calculus</b> and symbolic manipulation as a means of enhancing the teaching of Mathematics at the Senior Secondaiy level. The results indicate that such tools can bring about improvements in concept understanding, attitudes towards the subject and confidence in students 2 ̆ 7 abilities in this regard...|$|R

40|$|Francois Sillion and Claude Puech have {{provided}} a superb book on the simulation of global illumination in computer graphics. Specifically, the authors deal with the radiosity method and Monte Carlo techniques. The authors place a far greater emphasis on the radiosity method, devoting just a short portion of the text to Monte Carlo approaches. The book places much of the recent {{research in the area}} of global illumination into a framework that is comprehensive and relatively easy for researchers in other domains, particularly various branches of engineering, to absorb. The book presumes familiarity with basic computer <b>graphics</b> concepts, <b>calculus,</b> and linear algebra. This work would be appropriate as a text for a graduate course on rendering techniques and for anyone who is interested in doing research in this area. Portions of the book could also be used to supplement an introductory course in computer graphics. While end users ofradiosity systems may well find some valuable information here, the book seems to be less useful for this particular audience, as it is primarily concerned with surveying the state of the art...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{of control and}} estimation problems under unknown but bounded errors and disturbances, {{as well as those}} of differential games and related issues, may lead to solutions and procedures formulated in terms of sets and set-valued functions. However, the relevant mathematical tools are usually complicated and not easy to apply, even in the linear-convex case. This book gives an account of an ellipsoidal calculus and ellipsoidal techniques, developed by the authors, that allows presentation of the set-valued solutions to these problems in terms of approximating ellipsoidal-valued functions. Such an attack leads to effective computation schemes and opens the way to applications and implementations with computer animation, particularly in decision support systems. The problems treated in this volume are those that involve calculation of attainability domains, of control synthesis under bounded controls, state constraints and unknown input disturbances, {{as well as those of}} "viability" and of the "bounding approach" to state estimation. The text ranges from a specially developed theory of exact set-valued solutions to the description of ellipsoidal calculus, related ellipsoidal-based methods and examples worked out with computer <b>graphics.</b> The <b>calculus</b> given may also be interpreted as a generalized technique of the "interval analysis" type with an impact on scientific computation...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural Production Economics (Second Edition) is {{a revised}} {{edition of the}} Textbook Agricultural Production Economics {{published}} by Macmillan in 1986 (ISBN 0 - 02 - 328060 - 3).

The book contains a comprehensive treatment of the traditional agricultural production economics topics employing both detailed <b>graphics</b> and differential <b>calculus.</b> The text focuses on the neoclassical factor-product, factor-factor and product-product models, and is suitable for an advanced undergraduate or a beginning graduate-level course in static production economics. Chapters also deal with linear programming, risk and uncertainty and intertemporal resource allocation. Two new chapters have been added dealing with contemporary production theory in the factor and product markets. A basic knowledge of differential calculus is assumed.

40|$|The {{adaptation}} of the Spanish University to the European Higher Education Area (EEES in Spanish) demands the integration of new tools and skills {{that would make the}} teaching- learning process easier. This adaptation involves a change in the evaluation methods, which goes from a system where the student was evaluated with a final exam, to a new system where we include a continuous evaluation in which the final exam may represent at most 50 % {{in the vast majority of}} the Universities. Devising a new and fair continuous evaluation system is not an easy task to do. That would mean a student’s’ learning process follow-up by the teachers, and as a consequence an additional workload on existing staff resources. Traditionally, the continuous evaluation is associated with the daily work of the student and a collection of the different marks partly or entirely based on the work they do during the academic year. Now, small groups of students and an attendance control are important aspects to take into account in order to get an adequate assessment of the students. However, most of the university degrees have groups with more than 70 students, and the attendance control is a complicated task to perform, mostly because it consumes significant amounts of staff time. Another problem found is that the attendance control would encourage not-interested students to be present at class, which might cause some troubles to their classmates. After a two year experience in the development of a continuous assessment in Statistics subjects in Social Science degrees, we think that individual and periodical tasks are the best way to assess results. These tasks or examinations must be done in classroom during regular lessons, so we need an efficient system to put together different and personal questions in order to prevent students from cheating. In this paper we provide an efficient and effective way to elaborate random examination papers by using Sweave, a tool that generates data, <b>graphics</b> and statistical <b>calculus</b> from the software R and shows results in PDF documents created by Latex. In this way, we will be able to design an exam template which could be compiled in order to generate as many PDF documents as it is required, and at the same time, solutions are provided to easily correct them...|$|R
