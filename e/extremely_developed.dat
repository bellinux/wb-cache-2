They most often use this to navigate through poor lighting conditions or to identify and track prey. There is currently an uncertainty whether this is simply an <b>extremely</b> <b>developed</b> post-sensory interpretation of auditory perceptions or it actually constitutes a separate sense. Resolution of the issue will require brain scans of animals while they actually perform echolocation, a task that has proven difficult in practice.|$|E

2500|$|According to Kaminsky, much of Huston's vision {{probably}} {{came from}} his early experience as a painter {{on the streets of}} Paris. While there, he studied art and worked at it {{for a year and a}} half. Huston continued painting as a hobby for most of his life. Kaminsky also notes that most of Huston's films [...] "reflected this prime interest in the image, the moving portrait and the use of color." [...] Huston explored the use of [...] "stylistic framing", especially well-planned close-ups, in much of his directing. In his first film, The Maltese Falcon, for instance, Huston sketched out all of his scenes beforehand, [...] "like canvases of paintings". His daughter, Anjelica Huston adds that even for his subsequent films, he sketched storyboards [...] "constantly". She agrees that for her father, [...] "it was a form of study, and my father was a painter, a very good one." [...] She also notes that [...] "there was an <b>extremely</b> <b>developed</b> sensory quality about my father, he didn't miss a trick." ...|$|E

"To prevent disappointment, I {{ought to}} add that Friedrich is the reverse of {{orthodox}} in 'Political Economy;' {{that he had not}} faith in Free-Trade, but the reverse;--nor had ever heard of those ultimate Evangels, unlimited Competition, fair Start, and perfervid Race by all the world (towards 'CHEAP-AND-NASTY,' as the likeliest winning-post for all the world), which have since been vouchsafed us. Probably in the world there was never less of a Free-Trader! Constraint, regulation, encouragement, discouragement, reward, punishment; these he never doubted were the method, and that government was good everywhere if wise, bad only if not wise. And sure enough these methods, where human justice and the earnest sense and insight of a Friedrich preside over them, have results, which differ notably from opposite cases that can be imagined! The desperate notion of giving up government altogether, as a relief from human blockheadism in your governors, and their want even of a wish to be just or wise, had not entered into the thoughts of Friedrich; nor driven him upon trying to believe that such, in regard to any Human Interest whatever, was, or could be except for a little while in <b>extremely</b> <b>developed</b> cases, the true way of managing it. How disgusting, accordingly, is the Prussia of Friedrich to a Hanbury Williams; who has bad eyes and dirty spectacles, and hates Friedrich: how singular and lamentable to a Mirabeau Junior, who has good eyes, and loves him! No knave, no impertinent blockhead even, can follow his own beautiful devices here; but is instantly had up, or comes upon a turnpike strictly shut for him. 'Was the like ever heard of?' snarls Hanbury furiously (as an angry dog might, in a labyrinth it sees not the least use for): 'What unspeakable want of liberty!'--and reads to you as if he were lying outright; but generally is not, only exaggerating, tumbling upside down, to a furious degree; knocking against the labyrinth HE sees not the least use for.

5000|$|A {{subordinate}} of Zess, Cleo is a 12-year-old mech {{pilot who}} looks like a teenager; her friend Lee used to make fun of her for being <b>extremely</b> <b>developed</b> for her age. She's a quick learner, but despite this she is very clumsy and somewhat a slow thinker with some subjects. She says her positive skills are cooking, laundry, and keeping watch without even getting tired. She graduated from military school after two years, when it ordinarily takes six years. When Cleo learns that Lee was killed in battle, Cleo believes Rygart killed her (unaware that Lee committed suicide) and initially wants to kill him. Afterward, she meets Rygart in battle and shows a surprising amount of skill contrary to how she was before, almost defeating Rygart. She is defeated shortly after securing Zess's escape and taken prisoner, where she was treated very leniently and shared a room with Sigyn. She initially tried to escape by securing Sigyn's gun and attempting to kill Rygart, but fails because the gun actually had no ammo. She befriends Sigyn and no longer tries to escape afterward. Later, she is released in a hostage exchange for Rygart and his squad. Her family has been serving the Athens military for three generations, with her grandmother a retired mech pilot who is now an Athens military academy instructor and her mother, a high-ranking officer in the Athens military.|$|E
