5|$|P. p. centralis, {{described}} by Erwin Stresemann in 1928 under its current name, breeds in Central Asia. It is smaller and less strongly blue than P. p. himalayanus, but its <b>distinctness</b> {{from the next}} subspecies has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|However, other taxonomists {{challenged}} {{the validity of}} the species as early as 1939, noting that the Lānai hookbill was only known from one specimen and arguing that it was merely an aberrant and partially albino female ōū. The hookbill's validity was not confirmed until 1989 when the specimen's skull was removed and examined. The bird's cranial osteology, myology, plumage, and bill morphology confirmed the <b>distinctness</b> of the species.|$|E
5|$|In its taxonomic history, Harrya chromapes {{has been}} shuffled to several {{different}} genera, including Boletus, Leccinum, and Tylopilus, {{and is known}} in field guides {{as a member of}} one of these genera. In 2012, it was transferred to the newly created genus Harrya when it was established that morphological and molecular evidence demonstrated its <b>distinctness</b> from the genera in which it had formerly been placed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>distinctness</b> of the Donegal {{tradition}} developed due to {{the close}} relations between Donegal and Scotland, and the Donegal repertoire and style has influences from Scottish fiddle music. For example, {{in addition to the}} standard tune types such as Jigs and Reels, the Donegal tradition also has Highlands (influenced by the Scottish Strathspey). The distinctiveness of the Donegal tradition led to some conflict between Donegal players and representatives of the mainstream tradition when Irish traditional music was organised in the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|In {{areas of}} Pakistan where its range {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} the dusky crag martin, the pale crag martin breeds at a higher altitude. Its range does not overlap there with the Eurasian crag martin, which is found high in the Himalayas, but where both occur in Iran, the pale crag martin favours more arid habitats. In North Africa, the Eurasian species is again found at a higher level. The separation by altitude and aridity means that it is not known whether the closely related Ptyonoprogne martins could hybridise. If they were shown to do so, it would cast doubts on their specific <b>distinctness.</b>|$|E
5|$|A phylogenetic {{study of}} South American Armillaria species {{concluded}} that A.luteobubalina is in a lineage that includes A.montagnei, {{and these are}} sister to a lineage containing A.paulensis, a species known from a single specimen collected in São Paulo, Brazil. Although they are very similar, specimens of A.luteobubalina have smaller spores than Argentinian specimens of A.montagnei, and their <b>distinctness</b> is well-supported with phylogenetic analysis. Based on analysis of pectic enzymes, A.luteobubalina {{is closely related to}} A.limonea, a species found in New Zealand; this result corroborates phylogenetic analyses reported in 2003 and 2006. Molecular analysis of 27 collections of A.luteobubalina from southwest Western Australia and one from Traralgon revealed four distinct polymorphic groups. The genetic variety suggests it is native to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{studies of}} the palustris–couesi contact zone in Texas {{published}} in 1979, using more specimens and characters, indicated that the two species are in fact easily distinguishable there; therefore, O.couesi has since been regarded as a species distinct from the marsh rice rat. Afterward, {{some of the other}} forms synonymized under O.couesi or O.palustris were resurrected as separate species—Oryzomys nelsoni from the Marías Islands, western Mexico, and Oryzomys antillarum from Jamaica. In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed western Mexican Oryzomys, reaffirmed the <b>distinctness</b> of O.nelsoni, and reinstated O.peninsulae from the tip of the Baja California Peninsula and O.albiventer from interior Mexico as species. Still, O.couesi included 22 synonyms, and Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales wrote that further research on O.couesi and related species would certainly result in the recognition of additional species.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1877, {{the first of}} many related species from the region described until the 1910s. In 1918, Edward Alphonso Goldman consolidated most into the single species Oryzomys couesi and in 1960 Raymond Hall united this taxon with its United States relative, the marsh rice rat (O.palustris), into a single widespread species; subsequently, many related, localized species retained by Goldman were also included in this taxon. After studies of the contact zone in Texas, where O.couesi and the marsh rice rat meet, were published in 1979 and underscored the <b>distinctness</b> of the two, they were again regarded as separate. Since then, some of the peripheral forms of the group, such as Oryzomys antillarum from Jamaica and Oryzomys peninsulae from the Baja California Peninsula, have been reinstated as species. Nevertheless, O.couesi as currently constituted is likely a composite of several species; a 2010 study, using DNA sequence data, found evidence to recognize separate species from the Pacific and eastern sides of the distribution of O.couesi and two additional species from Panama and Costa Rica. Generally, Oryzomys couesi is common and of no conservation concern, and it is even considered a plague species in places, but some populations are threatened.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle {{was first}} {{described}} by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, although John Latham had made notes on the species in 1781, from a specimen obtained in February 1780 at Princes Island off the westernmost cape of Java during Captain Cook's last voyage. Its specific name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek leuko- 'white', and gaster 'belly'. Its closest relative is the little-known Sanford's sea eagle of the Solomon Islands. These form a superspecies, and as is usual in other sea eagle superspecies, one (the white-bellied sea eagle) has a white head, as opposed to the other species' dark head. The bill and eyes are dark, and the talons are dark yellow as in all Southern Hemisphere sea eagles. Both these species have at least some dark colouration in their tails, though this may not always be clearly visible in the white-bellied sea eagle. The nucleotide sequences of the cytochrome b gene of the two sea eagles were among those analysed in a 1996 study. Although they differ greatly in appearance and ecology, their genetic divergence of 0.3% indicates that the ancestors of the two forms might have diverged as recently as 150,000 years ago. The study authors conclude that although the genetic divergence is more consistent with subspecies, the <b>distinctness</b> in appearance and behaviour warrants the two being retained as separate species. Mitochondrial sequence of the cytochrome b locus differs very slightly from that of Sanford's sea eagle suggesting a relatively recent divergence after New Guinea-based white-bellied sea eagles colonised the Solomon Islands.|$|E
25|$|A {{considerable}} number of subspecies have been described, but they differ little in appearance and the taxonomy of several need to be validated. Most subspecies are found in/near the Andes and in the Antilles. Although distinct from each other, {{the relationship of the}} Floridian subspecies to (and its <b>distinctness</b> from) the Caribbean birds is not quite clear.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the dispute}} hinges upon the <b>distinctness</b> of the Caribbean and Central American populations, the second taxon in this species to be {{describe}}d. To describe the two most extreme views, some authors assemble {{the bulk of the}} mainland population in the nominate subspecies but treat the parapatric populations as distinct subspecies, while others place all resident populations in maculata and all migratory ones in virescens.|$|E
25|$|I {{have been}} born with four dispositions well adapted for making {{progress}} in science, but with two great defects in the faculties necessary for that purpose. 1. An ardent desire to know the truth; 2. Great activity of mind; 3. An uncommon (justesse) soundness of understanding; 4. A strong desire for precision and <b>distinctness</b> of ideas; 5. An excessive weakness of memory; 6. A great incapacity of continued attention.|$|E
25|$|Novalis influenced, among others, {{the novelist}} and theologian George MacDonald, who {{translated}} his 'Hymns to the Night' in 1897. More recently, Novalis, and the Early Romanticism (Frühromantik) {{movement as a}} whole, has been recognized as constituting a separate philosophical school, as opposed to simply a literary movement. Recognition of the <b>distinctness</b> of Frühromantik philosophy is owed largely, in the English speaking world at least, to the writer Frederick Beiser.|$|E
25|$|Loan {{words from}} Iranian languages, {{along with the}} other ancient {{accounts}} such as that of Xenophon above, initially led linguists to erroneously classify Armenian as an Iranian language. Scholars such as Paul de Lagarde and F. Müller believed that the similarities between the two languages meant that Iranian and Armenian were the same language. The <b>distinctness</b> of Armenian was recognized when philologist Heinrich Hübschmann (1875) used the comparative method to distinguish two layers of Iranian loans from the older Armenian vocabulary. He showed that Armenian often had 2 morphemes for the one concept, and the non-Iranian components yielded a consistent PIE pattern distinct from Iranian, and also demonstrated that the inflectional morphology was different from that in Iranian languages.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{disagreement}} concerning {{how best}} to describe the unifying themes, if there are any, {{that can be found}} in Machiavelli's works, especially in the two major political works, The Prince and Discourses. Some commentators have described him as inconsistent, and perhaps as not even putting a high priority in consistency. Others such as Hans Baron have argued that his ideas must have changed dramatically over time. Some have argued that his conclusions are best understood as a product of his times, experiences and education. Others, such as Leo Strauss and Harvey Mansfield, have argued strongly that there is a very strong and deliberate consistency and <b>distinctness,</b> even arguing that this extends to all of Machiavelli's works including his comedies and letters.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the lumping-together of taxa {{had come to}} be preferred. The 3rd edition of the AOU {{checklist}} in 1910 placed the screech owls back in Otus. Although this move was never unequivocally accepted, it was the dominant treatment throughout most of the 20th century. In 1988 it was attempted to resolve this by re-establishing all those genera split some 140 years earlier at subgenus rank inside Otus. Still, the diversity and <b>distinctness</b> of the group failed to come together in a good evolutionary and phylogenetic picture, and {{it was not until the}} availability of DNA sequence data that this could be resolved. In 1999, a preliminary study of mtDNA cytochrome b across a wide range of owls found that even the treatment as subgenera was probably unsustainable and suggested that most of the genera proposed around 1850 should be accepted. Though there was some debate about the reliability of these findings at first, they have been confirmed by subsequent studies. In 2003, the AOU formally re-accepted the genus Megascops again.|$|E
25|$|In 1879, D. C. Eaton (who {{had since}} {{accepted}} the <b>distinctness</b> of the species), suggested that an experimenter {{should attempt to}} artificially cross A.ebeneum with Camptosorus rhizophyllus to see if A.ebenoides would be produced. This challenge was not taken up until 1898, when George E. Davenport presented a paper on fern hybridization to the Linnæan Fern Chapter which mentioned Eaton's suggestion. Margaret Slosson was inspired by Davenport's work to undertake the experiment, as well as attempting a cross between two species of Aspidium (now Dryopteris). While her initial attempts were unsuccessful, Slosson was able to report in 1902 that the crossing of A.ebeneum and Camptosorus rhizophyllus produced ferns that were, in all important morphological characters, identical to A.ebenoides, proving its hybrid character. To acknowledge its hybrid origin and recognize the genus Camptosorus as segregate from Asplenium, Edgar T. Wherry renamed it ×Asplenosorus ebenoides in 1937, although this name was not universally recognized. In 1956, C. V. Morton {{pointed out that the}} lack of a Latin diagnosis for the hybrid genus ×Asplenosorus made that genus and combinations under it invalid under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature; in any case, he preferred to consolidate Camptosorus into Asplenium.|$|E
500|$|The <b>distinctness</b> of {{this species}} has been {{described}} as weak by some authors, [...] although its status as a full species has been maintained. It forms a superspecies with Jackson's francolin, handsome francolin, chestnut-naped francolin, and Erckel's francolin; it is particularly closely related to the latter two species and is intermediate to them in both location and morphological features. The Djibouti francolin has no recognized subspecies.|$|E

500|$|Margaret's fashion style—often {{described}} as unconventional and extravagant—and her musical endeavors, {{are the subject}} of wide media coverage in Poland. The singer has created her own original style, which has been commended by several fashion experts, praising Margaret for her <b>distinctness</b> and versatility. The stylist Basia Richard (who worked with Selena Gomez, Hilary Duff and Irina Shayk) is impressed by Margaret's ability to do [...] "something completely different from everyone else" [...] and has named her one of the best-dressed Polish stars. Marcin Brzeziński of Viva! magazine expressed his admiration for Margaret's approach to fashion {{and the fact that she}} has no limits, whilst Dorota Wróblewska, the Polish stylist and fashion show producer, noted that the singer is not afraid of criticism and likes to surprise with her fashion choices.

500|$|In the 1820s, German {{explorer}} Eduard Rüppell {{collected a}} female jungle cat near Lake Manzala in the Nile Delta. English naturalist Thomas Hardwicke’s collection of illustrations of Indian wildlife comprises the first drawing of an Indian jungle cat, named the [...] "allied cat" [...] (Felis affinis) by British zoologist John Edward Gray in 1830. Two years later, German naturalist Johann Friedrich von Brandt proposed {{a new species}} under the name Felis rüppelii, recognising the <b>distinctness</b> of the Egyptian jungle cat. The same year, a stuffed cat was presented {{at a meeting of}} the Asiatic Society of Bengal that had been caught in the jungles of Midnapore (West Bengal, India). J. T. Pearson, who donated the specimen, proposed the name Felis kutas for the specimen, noting that it differed in colouration from Felis chaus. French zoologist Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire described a jungle cat from the area of Dehra Dun in northern India in 1844 under the name Felis jacquemontii in memory of the French explorer Victor Jacquemont.|$|E
500|$|B.telmatiaea {{was first}} {{collected}} around 1840 by Ludwig Preiss and James Drummond. For many {{years it was}} included in B.sphaerocarpa, but by 1980 it was recognised as a distinct species. In recognition of its <b>distinctness</b> from, yet affinity with, B.sphaerocarpa, {{it was for a}} time informally referred to as Banksia aff. Sphaerocarpa. It was eventually published by Alex George in his 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae), based on a specimen collected by him on the Brand Highway about 45km (28mi) north of Regans Ford on 14 May 1969, and labelled [...] "A. S. George 9309". He found it most closely resembled B.leptophylla, but regarded its preference for swampy rather than sandy soils and winter flowering as worthy of warranting species status. George gave it the specific name telmatiaea from the Greek stem telmat-/τελματ- ("the mud of a pond"), in reference to its swampy habitat. Thus the full name for the species is Banksia telmatiaea A.S.George. Common names for B. telmatiaea include swamp fox banksia and marsh banksia.|$|E
500|$|Fossils of Smilodon were {{discovered}} in North America from {{the second half of}} the 19th century onwards. In 1869, American paleontologist Joseph Leidy described a maxilla fragment with a molar, which had been discovered in a petroleum bed in Hardin County, Texas. He referred the specimen to the genus Felis (which was then used for most cats, extant as well as extinct) but found it distinct enough to be part of its own subgenus, as F. (Trucifelis) fatalis. The species name means [...] "fate" [...] or [...] "destiny", but it is thought Leidy intended it to mean [...] "fatal". In an 1880 article about extinct American cats, American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope pointed out that the F.fatalis molar was identical to that of Smilodon, and he proposed the new combination S.fatalis. Most North American finds were scanty until excavations began in the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, where hundreds of individuals of S.fatalis have been found since 1875. S.fatalis has junior synonyms such as S.mercerii, S.floridanus, and S.californicus. American paleontologist Annalisa Berta considered the holotype of S.fatalis too incomplete to be an adequate type specimen, and the species has at times been proposed to be a junior synonym of S.populator. Swedish paleontologists Björn Kurtén and Lars Werdelin supported the <b>distinctness</b> of the two species in 1990.|$|E

2500|$|French mycologist Lucien Quélet had {{classified}} {{a number}} of Boletus species in the genus Xerocomus, with Xerocomus subtomentosus made the type species.

This classification was disputed, with many authorities not recognising the genus and continuing to use Boletus subtomentosus; however genetic analysis published in 2013 confirmed the <b>distinctness</b> of this species and its close relatives from the core group of fungi in the genus Boletus (sensu stricto).|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} Wallace's {{attention}} to detail is {{his description of the}} fictional chariot race and its setting at the arena in Antioch.

2500|$|Usually the {{starlings}} {{are considered}} a family, as is done here. Sibley & Monroe included the mimids {{in the family and}} demoted the starlings to tribe rank, as Sturnini. This treatment was used by Zuccon et al. However, the grouping of Sibley & Monroe (besides leaving the subfamily rank vacant) is overly coarse due to methodological drawbacks of their DNA-DNA hybridization technique and most of their proposed revisions of taxonomic rank have not been accepted (see for example Ciconiiformes). The all-inclusive Sturnidae grouping is all but noninformative as regards biogeography, and obscures the evolutionary <b>distinctness</b> of the three lineages. Establishing a valid name for the clade consisting of Sibley/Monroe's [...] "pan-Sturnidae" [...] would nonetheless be desirable to contrast them with the other major lineages of Muscicapoidea.|$|E
2500|$|The Torah {{does not}} give {{specific}} reasons {{for most of the}} laws of kashrut. However, a number of explanations have been offered, including maintaining ritual purity, teaching impulse control, encouraging obedience to God, improving health, reducing cruelty to animals and preserving the <b>distinctness</b> of the Jewish community. The various categories of dietary laws may have developed for different reasons, and some may exist for multiple reasons. For example, people are forbidden from consuming the blood of birds and mammals because, according to the Torah, this is where animal souls are contained. In contrast, the Torah forbids Israelites from eating non-kosher species because [...] "they are unclean". The Kabbalah describes sparks of holiness that are released by the act of eating kosher foods, but are too tightly bound in non-kosher foods to be released by eating.|$|E
2500|$|The {{northern}} screech-owls {{are found}} in eastern states, such as New Jersey and New York. The screech owls are named for their piercing calls. The normal territorial call is not a hoot as with some owls, but a trill consisting of more than 4 individual calls per second given in rapid succession (although the sound does not resemble screeching or screaming). They also {{have a kind of}} [...] "song" [...] which is used in courtship and, as a duet, between members of a pair. Calls differ widely between species in type and pitch, and in the field are often the first indication of these birds' presence, as well as the most reliable means to distinguish between species. The <b>distinctness</b> of many species of screech owls was first realized when vastly differing calls of externally similar birds from adjacent regions were noted.|$|E
