50|$|In some cases, an individual's {{behavior}} {{occurs as}} a way of <b>getting</b> <b>attention</b> so the best strategy may be to ignore it. The positive consequence of the behavior is <b>getting</b> <b>attention.</b> When this is removed, it is assumed the behavior will eventually cease. While tactical ignoring may be used in conjunction with other techniques {{in a wide variety of}} situations, it is most commonly effective in responding to behaviors such as swearing, yelling and sulking.|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} records of domesticated red foxes and others, but rarely of {{sustained}} domestication. A recent and notable {{case is the}} Russian silver fox, which resulted in visible and behavioral changes, and is {{a case study of}} an animal population modeling according to human domestication needs. The current group of domesticated silver foxes are the result of nearly fifty years of experiments in the Soviet Union and Russia to domesticate the silver morph of the red fox. This selective breeding resulted in physical and behavioral traits appearing that are frequently seen in domestic cats, dogs, and other animals, such as pigmentation changes, floppy ears, and curly tails. Notably, the new foxes became more tame, allowing themselves to be petted, whimpering to <b>get</b> <b>attention</b> and sniffing and licking their caretakers.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{entered the}} University of Oxford {{at the age}} of 17. She studied at St. Anne's College, and {{graduated}} with a BA in English Literature. As an undergraduate, she wrote for Isis, the university's literary magazine, to which she contributed interviews with the journalist Auberon Waugh and the actor Dudley Moore. Brown's sharp, witty prose led to her being published by the New Statesman while she was still an undergraduate at Oxford. Her friendship with Waugh served as a boost to her writing career, as he used his influence to <b>get</b> <b>attention</b> drawn to her ability. Later, she went on to date the writer Martin Amis. While still at Oxford, she won The Sunday Times National Student Drama Award for her one-act play Under the Bamboo Tree. A subsequent play, Happy Yellow, in 1977 was mounted at the London fringe Bush Theatre and was later performed at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.|$|E
25|$|In September 1916, Christie {{enlisted in}} the army; he was called up in April 1917 to join the 52nd Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment, {{to serve as an}} infantryman. In April 1918, the {{regiment}} was despatched to France, where Christie was seconded to the Duke of Wellington's (West Riding) Regiment as a signalman. That June, he was injured in a mustard gas attack and spent a month in a military hospital in Calais. Christie claimed this attack left him permanently unable to speak loudly. Later in life, he also claimed the attack had rendered him blind and mute {{for three and a half}} years. His period of muteness was, he claimed, the reason for his inability to talk much louder than a whisper for the rest of his life. Ludovic Kennedy points out that no record of his blindness has been traced and that, while Christie may have lost his voice when he was admitted to hospital, he would not have been discharged as fit for duty had he remained a mute. His inability to talk loudly, Kennedy argues, was a psychological reaction to the gassing rather than a lasting toxic effect of the gas. That reaction, and Christie's exaggeration of the effects of the attack, stemmed from an underlying personality disorder that caused him to exaggerate or feign illness as a ploy to <b>get</b> <b>attention</b> and sympathy.|$|E

He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could be as bad as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E
