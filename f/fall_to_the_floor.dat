5|$|The third {{match was}} The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff) against The World's Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas) in a Ladder {{match for the}} World Tag Team Championship. The goal is to climb a ladder and {{retrieve}} the title belts suspended above the ring. The Hardys had the advantage {{for most of the}} match, but as Jeff was climbing the ladder to try and grab the belts, Benjamin botched a springboard attempt. Benjamin kicked the ladder from underneath Jeff, however, to gain control. The Hardys regained the advantage by pushing the ladder as The World's Greatest Tag Team were climbing it, causing Benjamin to <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Jeff Swanton bombed Haas as Matt climbed the ladder to get the belts and win.|$|E

5|$|Trinidad was {{subsequently}} scheduled {{to fight against}} Hacine Cherifi in a contest that he won by technical knockout in the fourth round. The event {{was part of a}} card that took place on May 11, 2002, and was organized in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Early in the first round Trinidad's strategy consisted of using his jab while Cherifi did not try to directly engage in the offensive. In the last minute of the round a punch by Trinidad hit Cherifi's chin leaving him disoriented, he followed this with a combination and scored a knockdown. In the second round, Trinidad displayed more boxing and was on the offensive by using combinations to the head and ribs. In the third Cherifi landed more punches than in the previous two, but Trinidad relied on throwing left jabs. One of his punches hit Cherifi's liver, followed by a punch to the jaw, making Cherifi <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> In the fourth, a series of combinations injured Cherifi, who collapsed to the floor twice, forfeiting the fight on the second occasion. Following this contest Trinidad announced his retirement, at the moment leaving the sport with a record of 41wins, one defeat, and 34wins by knockout.|$|E
25|$|The jumbie {{dance is}} {{performed}} by four couples, {{one man and}} one woman. They each do a series of sets, consisting of five quadrilles played at successively swifter tempos.

Women who were unable to conceive travelled to her church so that they could be touched by Mai Chaza, in the hope of being able to have a successful pregnancy.

25|$|Each new {{regeneration}} {{was also}} {{radically different from}} the previous one, even {{in terms of the}} visual effects used to represent the moment of regeneration. The very first regeneration was devised and executed by vision mixer Shirley Coward, who had rather unexpectedly come up with a method of achieving the effect electronically. The original plan of the production team was simply that William Hartnell would <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> at the end of The Tenth Planet and pull his cape over his face. Troughton would then appear at the top of The Power of the Daleks, retracting the cloak. Coward's then-innovative vision mix necessitated that Troughton be hastily contracted for The Tenth Planet, part four. The series' first regeneration sequence was then duly recorded on 8 October 1966, with the cliffhanger resolution filmed two weeks later on 22 October. (REF: The Second Doctor Handbook) Older portrayals of regenerations were either a simple fade between two incarnations, a glowing effect that revealed the next incarnation, or one incarnation morphing into the next.|$|E
25|$|The fifth {{match was}} a Texas Tornado match between Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) and The Varsity Club (Mike Rotunda and Kevin Sullivan). In this match, all the {{competitors}} were legal {{and there was}} no need to be tagged in. Sullivan and Rick started against each other while Rotunda and Scott battled each other. Rotunda dominated Scott and threw him out of the ring, which allowed Rotunda and Sullivan to double-team Rick. Scott entered the ring and Rick delivered a Belly To Back Suplex to Sullivan. Sullivan tossed Rick on the floor outside the ring. The match continued as Sullivan and Rotunda dominated the match. Rick tried to deliver a Lariat, which he called Steinerline, to Sullivan but Sullivan tossed him out of the ring. Scott was double teamed by Varsity Club. Rotunda came off the ropes to attack Scott but he pulled the rope down causing Rotunda to <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> In the ring, Sullivan tried to deliver a Shoulderbreaker to Rick but Scott delivered a Diving Crossbody on Sullivan. Both Steiner Brothers fell on Sullivan and pinned him to win the match.|$|E
25|$|Dual meets {{usually take}} place on evenings during the school week (Monday through Friday); on Saturday mornings, afternoons, or evenings; or even on Sunday mornings or afternoons during the wrestling season and begin with weigh-ins at a maximum of one hour before the meet begins. No weight {{allowances}} are made for dual meets and multiple-day dual meets. Wrestlers are also examined by a physician or a certified athletic trainer for any communicable skin diseases. If a student-wrestler does not make weight, he is ineligible for that weight class and a forfeit is scored. If there are any communicable skin diseases, it is a ground for disqualification. The wrestler's coach or athletic trainer can provide written documentation from a physician that a skin infection of a wrestler would not be communicable. The final judgement for whether a wrestler {{would be allowed to}} compete lies with the meet physician or athletic trainer on site. In all cases, after determining the sequence of weight classes for the dual meet, the referee will call the wrestlers from each team who have been designated as captains. One of the visiting captains will call a disk toss. The colored disk will then <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and determine: 1) which team has the choice of position {{at the start of the}} second period and 2) which one of the team's members is to appear first on the mat when called by the referee for each weight class. The wrestler-captain who won the disk toss may choose the even or odd weight classes. That is, he may choose the weight classes, from lowest to highest, that are numbered evenly or oddly. For example, the 125lb, 141lb, 157lb, etc. weight classes would be odd, and the 133lb, 149lb, 165lb, etc. weight classes would be even. This order would work in the traditional sequence until the last even weight class of 285lb.|$|E

It was the second most highly watched programme of the day. The episode sees Sonia denouncing Pauline as [...] "sick" [...] for not wanting to share her son with the woman he loved, to which Pauline retorts, [...] "I'll tell you what's sick. You. Daughter of a scrubber, lesbian, under-age mother who gave away her own baby." [...] The row culminates with Sonia slapping Pauline, causing her to <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and break the Fowler fruit bowl‚Äî"the enduring symbol of her family, which smashed, significantly, into smithereens." [...] Though Pauline resolves to stay and reunite with her family in the end, she does not get the chance, as she collapses and dies {{in the middle of}} Albert Square, leaving both characters and viewers in uncertainty about the cause of her demise.|$|E
500|$|In 1989 {{the church}} was damaged again, in the Loma Prieta earthquake. [...] The {{integrity}} of the structure remained, but the crossing structure, the only {{major part of the}} building that was not damaged in the 1906 earthquake, buckled and caused several stones in the north and west arches to slip as much as [...] [...] The four mosaic angels in the pendentives, which decorated its high rounded walls directly below the church's dome and served as the setting beds {{for hundreds of thousands of}} tesserae, were severely damaged. [...] The angels' damage caused large chunks of mortar and glass to <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> eighty feet below , while other sections [...] "were left hanging by the sheer geometry of their arched shape". [...] An eight-foot mosaic section of an angel's left wing in the church's northeast corner fell [...] to the floor. [...] Several stones from the east arch wall fell onto pews in the balcony, and the organ-loft railing collapsed inward. Although the damage was minor, the church remained closed until 1992 while restoration, as well as protecting the building from future earthquakes, was carried out. [...] A $10 million fundraising drive was conducted to pay for repairs.|$|E
500|$|Known {{for taking}} the stage at early concerts with {{hundreds}} of clothespins attached to his hair and clothes, Haynes would often strip throughout a show until he was down to his underwear, or less, by the end. Other attire included flasher-style trench coats over his nakedness, ridiculously home-styled wigs and cross-dressing; often enjoying a skirt made of an American flag and a large '60s torpedo-style stuffed bra. At other times he would hide condoms full of stage blood in his clothes and repeatedly <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> appearing to bleed profusely. Some of Haynes' other favorite tricks involved throwing handfuls of photocopied cockroach images into the crowd, rolls and rolls of toilet paper tossed across the audience, as well as filling an inverted cymbal with lighter fluid, setting it (and sometimes his hand) on fire, and repeatedly hitting it with a mallet. As previously mentioned he would sing through almost anything that would alter his voice, including toilet paper rolls and megaphones early on, which eventually evolved into [...] "Gibby's kit", a.k.a. [...] "Gibbytronix," [...] a rack of vocal effects stacked as high as he could reach, before which he would often stand {{for the majority of}} the show in later performances. He also often utilized various foot switches which would be used to activate certain vocal effects, and when thought to be dancing during some performances he would actually be stepping on his various pedals. Adding to the spectacle were Coffey and Nervosa, who played in unison on stand-up drum kits; behind which they would collapse onto the floor and out of eyeshot, to collect their breath and strength before rising just in time to play the next song. Finally, the whole band would often tear apart stuffed animals while on stage, throwing the stuffing through the air, creating a rather disturbing throbbing effect, caused by the stroboscopes that were always on.|$|E

2500|$|During the Second World War, {{some new}} types of toys were created through {{accidental}} innovation. After {{trying to create a}} replacement for synthetic rubber, the American Earl L. Warrick inadvertently invented [...] "nutty putty" [...] during World War II. Later, Peter Hodgson recognized the potential as a childhood plaything and packaged it as Silly Putty. Similarly, Play-Doh was originally created as a wallpaper cleaner. In 1943 Richard James was experimenting with springs as part of his military research when he saw one come loose and <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> He was intrigued by the way it flopped around on the floor.

2500|$|Since 1868, {{the pope}} was plagued first by facial {{erysipelas}} {{and then by}} open sores on his legs. Nevertheless, he insisted on celebrating daily Mass. The extraordinary heat of the summer of 1877 worsened the sores {{to the effect that}} he had to be carried. He underwent several painful medical procedures, which he undertook with remarkable patience. He spent most of his last few weeks in his library, where he received cardinals and held papal audiences. On 8 December, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, his situation improved markedly to the point that he could walk again. By February, he could say Mass again on his own in standing position, enjoying the popular celebration of the 75th anniversary of his first communion. Bronchitis, a <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> and rising temperature worsened his situation after 4 February 1878. He continued joking about himself: when the Cardinal Vicar of Rome ordered bell-ringing and non-stop prayers for his recuperation, the pope asked, [...] "Why do you want to stop me from going to heaven?" [...] He told his doctor that his time had come. Pope Pius IX died on 7 February 1878, aged 85, concluding the longest pontificate in papal history, after that of St. Peter, whom tradition holds had reigned for 37 years. His last words were, [...] "Guard the church I loved so well and sacredly", as recorded by the cardinals kneeling beside his bedside. His body was originally buried in St. Peter's grotto, but was moved in a night procession on 13 July 1881 to the Basilica of Saint Lawrence outside the Walls. When the cortege approached the Tiber River, a group of anticlerical Romans screaming [...] "Long live Italy! Death to the Pope! Death to the Priests!" [...] threatened to throw the coffin into the river but a contingent of militia arrived to prevent this. The simple grave of Pius IX was changed by his successor, John Paul II, after his beatification.|$|E
