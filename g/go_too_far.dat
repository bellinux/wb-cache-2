5|$|Besides {{being criticized}} for its limited powers, {{there is also}} some concern that the Council's {{responsibilities}} may <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far.</b> By taking up the function of scrutinizing existing and prospective legislation for differentiating measures and inconsistencies with fundamental liberties, the Council may be encroaching on the functions of constitutional interpretation, which is traditionally the function of courts. Even though the Council has the additional advantage of identifying potentially unconstitutional legislation at an early stage, thereby preventing unnecessary litigation in the future, there is doubt as to the ability of the Council to take on such a task. Given that constitutional interpretation is traditionally the function of lawyers and the courts, the task may be best carried out by the legally trained members of the PCMR.|$|E
5|$|Prussia {{tried to}} take {{opportunity}} of the Russian Empire's wars with the Ottoman Empire and Sweden and move the weak Commonwealth into its sphere of influence. Some factions in the Commonwealth deemed {{this as an opportunity}} to shake free from decades of Russian control. That said, Prussia did not expect much from the alliance, not even that it would pass. When the treaty was first proposed to the Great Sejm by Prussian ambassador Ludwig Heinrich Buchholtz on 13 October 1788, Prussians expected that it would cause long and fruitless debate which only outcome would be to ensure the weakening of Russian (and to a lesser degree, Austrian) position in Poland. Overall, for Prussia, the alliance with Poland was only one of several potential options; but for some Polish politicians it became a new, and increasingly, only available strategy. The reception of Prussian proposal by the Sejm exceeded their expectations, and it has significantly strengthened the Patriotic Party. For the next year or so, Prussians decided to delay taking any clear action, keeping their options open. Buchholtz was also reprimanded for allowing things to <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far,</b> and another Prussian diplomat, Girolamo Lucchesini, was sent to Warsaw to aid him.|$|E

Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime.|$|E

25|$|Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often {{center on}} its story {{foremost}} {{as a warning}} against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E
500|$|Dishonored was not {{developed}} with a sequel in mind, but ideas for one {{began to emerge}} during the development of its downloadable content. Harvey Smith called the decision to play as Emily as intuitive at the start, with Emily having been {{a child in the}} original game. The impact that Emily had on players in Dishonored, which changed how the game was being played, made the developer decide to continue her story and give her more depth in Dishonored 2. Although this meant moving the timeline along, Arkane did not want to <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> for fear of losing the series' gaslamp fantasy / steampunk vibe. The choice to include Corvo as an alternate player character was itself a later decision.|$|E

500|$|Correspondent {{and author}} Warren Moscow wrote that after 1940, Willkie helped Roosevelt, {{who was always}} careful not to <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> in front of public opinion, [...] "as a pace-setter with the President's blessing". Willkie's global trip and the {{publication}} of One World increased {{public support for the}} idea that the United States should remain active internationally once the war was won, and should not withdraw into a new isolationism. [...] Indiana University president Herman B Wells noted that One World [...] "has had such a profound influence on the thinking of Americans". Zipp noted, [...] "He launched the most successful and unprecedented challenge to conventional nationalism in modern American history... He urged [...] to imagine and feel a new form of reciprocity with the world, one that millions of Americans responded to with unprecedented urgency." ...|$|E
500|$|With little land {{action in}} the west, the initial months of the war were dubbed the [...] "Bore War", later renamed the [...] "Phoney War" [...] by journalists. Chamberlain, in common with most Allied {{officials}} and generals, felt the war could be won relatively quickly by keeping economic pressure on Germany through a blockade while continuing rearmament. Chamberlain was reluctant to <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> in altering the British economy. The government submitted an emergency war budget about which Chamberlain stated, [...] "the {{only thing that matters}} is to win the war, though we may go bankrupt in the process". However, actual government expenditures rose by little more than the rate of inflation between September 1939 and March 1940. Despite these difficulties, Chamberlain still enjoyed approval ratings as high as 68% and almost 60% in April 1940.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1993–94 Sheffield Shield season, Ponting spoke of his goals for the summer. [...] "I've got myself the goal of making 1,000 runs in the season. Hopefully, I can stay in the middle long enough or do that. You can't worry about other people's expectation. I don't care at all what is written in the press. I like to read it but it doesn't <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> into my head." [...] In Tasmania's final {{round-robin}} match of the season, they needed to defeat South Australia outright to qualify for the final. Set 366 runs to win in 102 overs, Ponting joined Dene Hills at the crease with the score at 2/35. Ponting scored 161 in a 290-run partnership that ended with Tasmania needing just 41 runs for victory. Despite Tasmania losing four quick wickets after his dismissal, they won with four wickets in hand. Disappointingly for Ponting, he could not repeat the performance in the final against New South Wales. He scored just one and 28, as Tasmania were defeated by an innings and 61 runs. The season saw Ponting score 965 runs at 48.25, close to his 1,000 run goal.|$|E

500|$|The {{aesthetic}} is the personal, subjective {{realm of}} existence, where an individual lives and extracts pleasure from life only {{for his or}} her own sake. In this realm, one has the possibility of the highest as well as the lowest. The ethical, on the other hand, is the civic realm of existence, where one's value and identity are judged and at times superseded by the objective world. In simple terms, one can choose either to remain oblivious to all that goes on in the world, or to become involved. More specifically, the ethic realm starts with a conscious effort to choose one's life, with a choice to choose. Either way, however, an individual can <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> in these realms and lose sight of his or her true self. Only faith can rescue the individual from these two opposing realms. Either/Or concludes with a brief sermon hinting at the nature of the religious sphere of existence, which Kierkegaard spent most of his publishing career expounding upon. Ultimately, Kierkegaard's challenge is for the reader to [...] "discover a second face hidden behind the one you see" [...] in him/herself first, and then in others.|$|E
500|$|According to Oborne, Vorster was {{a pragmatic}} {{politician}} {{who wanted to}} maintain apartheid {{and to make it}} appear acceptable to the outside world. To this end, attempting to broaden South Africa's international connections, he accepted black foreign diplomats in the country and began to plan a policy to allow mixed-race sport to prevent South Africa's international isolation. However, such policies were unpopular with his domestic supporters and he was careful not to <b>go</b> <b>too</b> <b>far.</b> Oborne writes: [...] "Vorster knew that there was a limit to how far he could go without imperilling his own position. That limit was Basil D'Oliveira." [...] According to Oborne, Vorster never intended to allow D'Oliveira to play with the MCC team; his supporters would not have accepted a non-white South African benefiting from this change of policy and demonstrating his ability at a high level. Vorster therefore worked to give the impression overseas that D'Oliveira would be welcome, {{while at the same time}} doing his utmost to stop him from playing. He courted the British ambassador, Sir John Nicholls, and told him that a tour party including D'Oliveira would be acceptable. Nicholls passed this on to the UK government. Vorster meanwhile monitored D'Oliveira's progress closely; from his debut in 1966, South Africa kept a security file on him.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{gave the}} pilot episode an [...] "Outstanding" [...] rating of 9 out of 10, with Dan Iverson {{starting}} his review by saying [...] "Every [...] a show will come along {{that will be}} so creepy and so intriguing that you feel compelled to watch.

There are so many questions that we have about this show, and that is a good thing. Personally we cannot wait to see how long this game of cat-and-mouse goes on with the unknown serial killer and Dexter. With the solid introduction to the series, characters, and future storylines, we can't help but recommend Dexter to anybody that is at all curious about the show. [...] " [...] IGN reviewer Matt Fowler later placed Mike Donovan third on a list of [...] "Dexter's Top 10 Kills", saying [...] "We all remember our first. First car. First love. First staph infection. And when it comes to Dexter, first kill. No Mike Donovan, the church choir master, wasn't Dexter first dead body, but he was our televisual introduction into Dexter's wicked world of revenge and reckoning."

500|$|Janssen {{said the}} film is [...] "definitely played {{with a bit of}} a wink and doesn't take itself too seriously."

[...] Speaking of graphic violence, he said that [...] "the first version we tested was for sure the most extreme. Some stuff stayed in, some stuff got cut out." [...] By August 2012, Paramount was reportedly test screening two versions of the film, rated R and PG-13, and the R-rated cut received the positive feedback. Wirkola said, [...] "I was afraid. I actually made sure they could never cut it to PG-13...We always {{knew it was going to}} be R." [...] McKay said that Paramount's Adam Goodman [...] "was perceptive enough to see the same thing and got behind it as well." [...] Wirkola said, [...] "The pre-production and shooting went very smooth, but the post-production was very new to me and how they do things here with testing and the studio." [...] He said about the test screenings in particular: [...] "I can see why they do it – there’s a lot of money involved and they want it to hit as broad as possible. But I think it’s a flawed process, I really do." [...] McKay said that Paramount executives might nevertheless regret the film's R rating.|$|E
