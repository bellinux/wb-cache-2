Rejtan would remain in Warsaw {{during the next few}} years (the Partition Sejm lasted till 1776), but his influence diminished. He issued a print manifesto in December 1773, criticizing the current confederated sejm, and supportive of the Bar Confederation, but it received little publicity.|$|E
5|$|In June 1921, while Hitler and Eckart {{were on a}} {{fundraising}} trip to Berlin, a mutiny {{broke out}} within the NSDAP in Munich. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival German Socialist Party (DSP). Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would {{mean the end of}} the party. Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich. The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680. Hitler continued to <b>face</b> <b>some</b> opposition within the NSDAP: Opponents of Hitler in the leadership had Hermann Esser expelled from the party, and they printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking Hitler as a traitor to the party. In the following days, Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself and Esser, to thunderous applause. His strategy proved successful, and at a special party congress on 29 July, he was granted absolute powers as party chairman, replacing Drexler, by a vote of 533to1.|$|E

25|$|Commercial bonsai growers may {{use any of}} {{the other}} means of obtaining starter bonsai material, from seed {{propagation}} to collecting expeditions, but they generally sell mature specimens that display bonsai aesthetic qualities already. The grower trains the source specimens {{to a greater or lesser}} extent before sale, and the trees may be ready for display as soon as they are bought. Those who purchase commercially grown bonsai <b>face</b> <b>some</b> challenges, however, particularly of buying from another country. If the purchaser's local climate does not closely match the climate in which the bonsai was created, the plant will have difficulties surviving and thriving. As well, importing living plant material from a foreign source is often closely controlled by import regulations and may require a license or other special import arrangement on the buyer's part. If a local commercial bonsai grower does not exist, buying from a distant one may be unsatisfactory.|$|E

[...] This species will breed in the disused domed nest of a European magpie, or an active or unused stick nest of a large bird such as the white stork, white-tailed eagle, osprey, black kite or grey heron.

500|$|Contrary to Winkelman, the German command {{was very}} {{satisfied}} with the day's events.

The Germans had also been concerned that they may <b>face</b> <b>some</b> Belgian or even British divisions.

When this had been denied by chief of staff Franz Halder, he had arranged the formation of an extra Army Corps headquarters to direct the complex strategic situation of simultaneously fighting the Allies and advancing into the Fortress Holland over the Moerdijk bridges. As on 12 May no actual crisis seemed to materialise, with the French retreating and Belgian and British forces being completely absent, von Bock decided that XXVI Armeekorps would be responsible for pursuing the French south towards Antwerp, while some forces would be directed by the new headquarters, Generalkommando XXXIX under command of Generalleutnant Rudolf Schmidt, to advance north with 254.
