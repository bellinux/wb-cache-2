2500|$|External gearing is {{so called}} {{because all the}} {{sprockets}} involved are readily visible. There may be up to 4 chainrings attached to the crankset and pedals, and typically between 5 and 11 sprockets making up the cogset attached to the rear wheel. Modern front and rear derailleurs typically consist of a moveable chain-guide that is operated remotely by a Bowden cable attached to a shifter mounted on the down tube, <b>handlebar</b> <b>stem,</b> or handlebar. A shifter may be a single lever, or a pair of levers, or a twist grip; some shifters may be incorporated with brake levers into a single unit. When a rider operates the shifter while pedalling, the change in cable tension moves the chain-guide from side to side, [...] "derailing" [...] the chain onto different sprockets. The rear derailleur also has spring-mounted jockey wheels which take up any slack in the chain.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} recent {{varieties}} of stilt walking acts is a stilt walker riding a 'stilt bicycle'. This bicycle is usually an ordinary bicycle with extended seat post and <b>handlebar</b> <b>stem.</b>|$|E
50|$|The tikit was {{introduced}} in 2007. Early versions of the tikit employed a pair of brake cables in the hyperfold mechanism. This mechanism permitted excessive flex in the <b>handlebar</b> <b>stem</b> when ridden.|$|E
50|$|Bicycle {{components}} underwent {{radical change}} in the 1990s. The traditional quill <b>handlebar</b> <b>stem</b> was rendered obsolete {{by the introduction of}} the threadless headset. 3T responded with the industry's first forged stem for this application, the ForgeAhead. Other manufacturers followed 3T's lead and switched to this technique, abandoning welded stems.|$|E
50|$|Zipp is an American {{company that}} {{is best known for}} designing, manufacturing, and {{marketing}} carbon-composite bicycle wheels for road cycling, triathlons, and track racing.

50|$|SRAM {{purchased}} Truvativ in 2004, providing SRAM {{with a line}} of cranks, bottom brackets, <b>handlebars,</b> <b>stems,</b> pedals, seatposts {{and chain}} retention systems. This allowed SRAM to offer a complete drivetrain with the first SRAM branded road groupsets being released the following year.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008 {{a second}} {{version of the}} tikit was {{introduced}} known as the [...] "Model T", which sports a Brompton-style [...] "twiddly knob" [...] on the <b>handlebar</b> <b>stem</b> rather than the cable mechanism. This extends the folding time to about ten seconds. The [...] "Model T" [...] is $250 cheaper than the [...] "Hyperfold" [...] version.|$|E
50|$|In 2008 a {{new version}} of the tikit {{replaced}} the pair of brake cables with a single, and much thicker, cable, plus other improvements to the <b>handlebar</b> <b>stem</b> and to the rear seat pin assembly. The resulting bike is much stiffer. Bike Friday provides an upgrade path for 2007 tikits which provides some of the 2008 features, notably the new cable assembly.|$|E

50|$|In 1992 Bontrager Cycles {{expanded}} from a one-man shop {{to a limited}} production facility. In 1993 they started to produce <b>handlebar</b> <b>stems.</b> In 1995 Bontrager's business partner, Hans Heim, left to join Santa Cruz Cycles, and put his share of Bontrager Cycles up for sale. Trek acquired Bontrager Cycles and hired Bontrager as president.|$|R

50|$|The Melon Slice folding {{system is}} {{relatively}} conventional and straightforward. First, it folds at the pedals {{and then at}} the <b>handlebar</b> <b>stem.</b> The bike is then folded {{in the middle of the}} top tube so that the two halves come together. With practice, the bike can be folded in about 15 seconds. The folded size of the bike is 34”L x 27”H x 13”W.|$|E
5000|$|The tikit folds in {{a unique}} manner. [...] A hard slap on the {{seatpost}} pushes it forward and disengages a pin held by spring steel connecting the seat mast {{to the rear of}} the bike. This enables the rear half of the tikit to rotate vertically under the bike. The seat post and <b>handlebar</b> <b>stem</b> then each fold down at slight angles to body.|$|E
50|$|Only {{the very}} {{earliest}} examples had both a hinged seat tube and <b>handlebar</b> <b>stem.</b> Within {{a year or}} two of introduction the hinged seat tube was replaced by a conventional seat tube with a long seat post that could be slid down or removed altogether. The lower end of the seat tube was open, and {{to the rear of the}} bottom bracket, to allow the seat post to slide all the way down.|$|E
50|$|On November 6, 2007, SRAM {{acquired}} Zipp Speed Weaponry, {{a company}} designing and manufacturing high-end carbon wheelsets {{for use on}} road racing bicycles, {{as well as other}} high-end components such as cranksets, <b>handlebars,</b> <b>stems</b> and wheels. The company operates out of Indianapolis, Indiana and produces all of its carbon fiber rims at the company's American factory.|$|R
50|$|Folding bikes {{generally}} {{come with}} {{a wider range of}} adjustments for accommodating various riders than do conventional bikes, because folding bike frames are usually only made in one size. However, seatposts and <b>handlebar</b> <b>stems</b> on folders extend as much as four times higher than conventional bikes, and still longer after-market posts and stems provide an even greater range of adjustment.|$|R
50|$|Seven Cycles is an American bicycle {{designer}} and manufacturer based in Watertown, Massachusetts. Seven, a bespoke bicycle brand, {{was founded by}} Robert Vandermark in early 1997. Vandermark was {{the former head of}} research and development at Merlin Metalworks. Although Seven Cycles was founded to build high-end titanium and steel frames, in 1998 Seven began also building titanium-carbon frames and in 2002 began also building full carbon frames. All Seven brand bikes are handmade in their Watertown factory. Seven also manufactures custom titanium stems and mountain bike handlebars, carbon fiber road forks, aluminum <b>handlebars,</b> <b>stems,</b> and seat posts.|$|R
50|$|In late 2016, {{several new}} changes {{appeared}} classified as being for 2017. The 'M' and 'H' handlebars changed, with a switch to Brompton-designed integrated brake + bell + shifter + gear design units hung below the new handelbars. The handlebars retained the same overall height, {{but with a}} <b>handlebar</b> <b>stem</b> 20mm higher, meaning 20mm less rise required on the handlebars, and a smoother curve. The 'M', 'H' and flat 'S' handlebars switched to using longer and removal handlebar grips.|$|E
50|$|Until the 1960s, cyclists {{often carried}} a second {{bottle on the}} {{handlebars}}, held by a bottle cage fixed to the handlebars themselves and by a third point to the <b>handlebar</b> <b>stem.</b> Such bottle cages are familiar from pictures of the Tour de France. Riders had a cage there rather than have two on the frame, where the centre of gravity is lower, {{because at the time}} the Tour's rules insisted that riders carry a pump. The pump took up the length of one frame tube and made a second bottle cage on the frame impossible.|$|E
50|$|Moser's {{frames are}} unique among Italian racing {{bicycles}} for being fillet brazed using silver solder {{rather than using}} lugs with brass brazing; silver solder never gets hot enough to weaken the tubing and thus bicycles constructed in this manner {{do not need to}} be reinforced with lugs, thus reducing the bicycle's weight. After brazing, each frame is hand filed and aligned on a digital alignment table. The smooth lines resulting from the lack of lugs are emphasized with a unicrown fork and an integrated seatpost, attached by an expander bolt in a manner similar to the <b>handlebar</b> <b>stem.</b>|$|E
50|$|By 1970 3T <b>handlebars</b> and <b>stems</b> were in {{widespread}} {{use in the}} European professional peloton. In the quest for lighter weight, 3T switched production to aluminum alloy in place of steel. It {{was among the first}} to use aluminum for these components, where strength is critical to safety.|$|R
50|$|After retiring, Furtado {{started a}} company to design and produce female {{specific}} MTB components, such as smaller diameter <b>handlebars</b> and grips, <b>stems,</b> and seats.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike the Brompton or Birdy, this fold is not {{particularly}} compact; in fact, it is larger than many 20 and 16 in wheel folding bicycles (such as those from Dahon). However, the tikit's claim to fame is {{the speed of the}} fold in its [...] "Hyperfold" [...] model. Here, the action of rotating the rear of the bike slackens an internal cable which enables the <b>handlebar</b> <b>stem</b> to be folded. As a result, no quick release clamps, latches, or locks are involved in the fold. This feature, unique among folding bicycles, enables the tikit to fold easily in under five seconds.|$|E
50|$|The Birdy, {{like most}} folders, {{has a long}} {{seatpost}} and stem. Thousands of km of use can damage the headset or weaken the stem mount - old models could experience cracking after about ten years. The longer <b>handlebar</b> <b>stem</b> limits {{the extent to which}} the rider can pull on the handlebars, but a stronger adjustable version was introduced in the early 2000s that is more sturdy, and a further improvement in 2015. The larger head tube on the Moulton gives it better hill climbing and sprinting abilities. However, with proper cycling shoes, Birdy riders can be found in non-UCI racing events and in pacelines of fast group rides.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental {{evaluation of the}} fatigue behaviour of welded components under non-proportional variable amplitude biaxial loads. The study was undertaken on welded mountain bike <b>handlebar</b> <b>stems,</b> which were different in terms of geometry and technology and tested with load histories that were reconstructed and accelerated from recorded field data. Loads measured in the field were decomposed into bending and torsional components; a synchronous Peak-Valley counting, a spectrum inflation technique, a spline interpolation and a final amplification were applied to the measured signals {{in order to obtain}} test drive signals with the correct content of biaxial non-proportional loadings. After evaluation of the bending and torsion load-life curves of components under constant amplitude fatigue, the resulting data from biaxial variable amplitude fatigue tests were analysed in order to evaluate the damage contribution {{as a result of the}} two load components and an equivalent simplified two-stage constant amplitude fatigue test was proposed to the working group ISO/SC 1 /TC 149 /WG 4...|$|R
5000|$|The Bootie Folding Cycle came well-equipped, with mudguards, a {{built in}} luggage rack, {{front and rear}} lamp {{brackets}} and sidestand. The crankset is a steel, cottered mass market unit manufactured by Williams, and the <b>handlebars</b> and <b>stem</b> are conventional chrome plated steel. A black double sprung mattress type saddle was fitted to the 500 mm long 'L' shaped seatpost. Booties were shod with Dunlop or Michelin ETRTO size 203 - 62, balloon-type tyres.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999 Dynacraft voluntarily {{recalled}} about 3,000 Magna [...] "Great Divide" [...] 21 speed mountain bikes, {{sold in the}} 24-inch {{size for}} girls and boys, and the 26-inch size for women and men. The bikes could have defective handle bar stems which would not tighten sufficiently to lock onto the bicycles. This can cause the front wheel not to turn properly, resulting in serious injuries to the rider from falls. Dynacraft stated that is {{not aware of any}} injuries or incidents involving these bicycles. The bikes have a model number {{on the left side of}} the seat post. The girls' bikes have model number 8504-50 and are purple. The boys' bikes have model number 8504-51 and are blue. The women's bikes have model number 8547-84 and also are purple. The men's bikes have model number 8547-85 and are black. The words [...] "Great Divide" [...] are located on the cross-tubes of these bicycles and the word [...] "KALLOY" [...] is located on the <b>handlebar</b> <b>stems.</b> Fred Meyer Stores in Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Oregon, Utah and Washington sold these bikes from December 1998 through August 18, 1999.|$|R
