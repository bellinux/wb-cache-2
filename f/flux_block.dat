40|$|We {{present the}} results of the first {{theoretical}} non-radial non-adiabatic pulsational study of M dwarf stellar models with masses in the range 0. 1 to 0. 5 M_solar. We find the fundamental radial mode to be unstable due to an ϵ mechanism caused by deuterium (D-) burning for the young 0. 1 and 0. 2 M_solar models, by non-equilibrium He^ 3 burning for the 0. 2 and 0. 25 M_solar models of 10 ^ 4 Myr, and by a <b>flux</b> <b>blocking</b> mechanism for the partially convective 0. 4 and 0. 5 M_solar models once they reach the age of 500 Myr. The periods of the overstable modes excited by the D-burning are in the range 4. 2 to 5. 2 h for the 0. 1 M_solar models and is of order 8. 4 h for the 0. 2 M_solar models. The periods of the modes excited by He^ 3 burning and <b>flux</b> <b>blocking</b> are in the range 23 to 40 min. The more massive and oldest models are more promising for the observational detection of pulsations, as their ratio of instability e-folding time to age is more favourable.

Marginally significant bright symmetric rings (peak amplitude 0. 1 - 0. 3 percent) not attributable to residual facular signal or instrumental effects were observed around 6 of 10 sunspots. No evidence of more intense bright rings was found.

40|$|Abstract: The “ Cold Air Damming” {{consists}} {{in a weak}} cold air mass <b>flux</b> <b>blocked</b> by a mountain chain on the upward side, at low levels; is {{is not able to}} scavalcare the mountains in the lee side and is trapped topographically. This event develops extended low-middle level cloudness, low temperatures, generally weak precipitations and sometimes, freezing or frozen rain. In terms of thermodynamics, the cold air mass is generated by weak advection, adiabatic cooling as air ascends the mountain slopes and finally diabatic cooling by melting or evaporation. In this presentation, we consider two CAD cases reported in Italy: trapped cold air {{on the east side of}} Appenninian mountainous terrain (Adriatic coast) and into Po Valley. Primary diagnostic features are a weak easterly flux coming from the Balcan region and a thermal inversion at low level (Met 8 elaborated images, soundings). In terms of prognosis, Local Models frequently capture the CAD features well (low cloud cover, wind precipitation); some errors depend on parametrizations at low levels as thermal ad humidity lapse rate structures, as water phase into the cloud (liquid, iced, snow, supercooled water) and finally the intensity of the wind...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the transiting super-Earth CoRoT- 7 b, several investigations have yielded different results for the number and masses of planets present in the system, mainly owing to the star’s high level of activity. We re-observed CoRoT- 7 in January 2012 with both HARPS and CoRoT, so that we now have the benefit of simultaneous radial-velocity and photometric data. This allows us to use the off-transit variations in the star’s light curve to estimate the radial-velocity variations induced by the suppression of convective blueshift and the <b>flux</b> <b>blocked</b> by starspots. To account for activity-related effects in the radial-velocities which do not have a photometric signature, we also include an additional activity term in the radial-velocity model, which we treat as a Gaussian process with the same covariance properties (and hence the same frequency structure) as the light curve. Our model was incorporated into a Monte Carlo Markov Chain {{in order to make a}} precise determination of the orbits of CoRoT- 7 b and CoRoT- 7 c.

40|$|The Type Ia SN 2000 cx {{exhibited}} multiple peculiarities, {{including a}} lopsided B–band light–curve peak {{that does not}} conform to current methods for using shapes of light curves to standardize SN Ia luminosities. We use the parameterized supernova synthetic–spectrum code Synow to study line identifications in the photospheric–phase spectra of SN 2000 cx. Previous work established the presence of Ca II infrared–triplet features forming above velocity ∼ 20, 000 km s − 1, {{much higher than the}} photospheric velocity of ∼ 10, 000 km s − 1. We find Ti II features forming at the same high velocity. High–velocity line formation is partly responsible for the photometric peculiarities of SN 2000 cx: for example, B–band <b>flux</b> <b>blocking</b> by Ti II absorption features that decreases with time causes the B light curve to rise more rapidly and decline more slowly than it otherwise would. SN 2000 cx contains an absorption feature near 4530 ˚A that may be Hβ, forming at the same high velocity. The lack of conspicuous Hα and Pα signatures does not necessarily invalidate the Hβ identification if the high–velocity line formation is confined to a clump that partly covers the photosphere and the Hα and Pα source functions are elevated relative to that of resonance scattering. The Hβ identification is tentative. If it is correct, the high–velocity matter must have come from a nondegenerate companion star...|$|R

40|$|Received; {{accepted}} Context. As {{a planet}} eclipses its parent star, a dark {{spot on the}} surface of the star may be occulted, causing a detectable variation in the light curve. Aims. Study these light curve variations during transits and infer the physical characteristics of the stellar spots. Methods. A total of 77 consecutive transit light curves of CoRoT- 2 were observed with a high temporal resolution of 32 s, corresponding to an uninterrupted period of 134 days. By analyzing small intensity variations in the transit light curves, it was possible to detect and characterize spots at fixed positions (latitude and longitude) {{on the surface of}} the star. The model used simulates planetary transits and enables the inclusion of spots on the stellar surface with different sizes, intensities (i. e. temperatures), and positions. Fitting the data by this model, it is possible to infer the spots physical characteristics. Because what is observed is the stellar <b>flux</b> <b>blocked</b> by the spots, there is a degeneracy between the spots intensity and area. Thus the fits were either in spot longitude and radius, with a fixed intensity, or in spots longitude and intensity, for spots of constant size. The model allowed up to 9 spots to be present at the stellar surface within the transit band. Results. Before the modeling of the spots were performed, the planetary radius relative to the star radius was estimated by fitting the deepest transit to minimize the effect of spots.

40|$|Autophagy is a {{catabolic pathway}} that helps cells to survive under {{stressful}} conditions. Cells also use autophagy to clear microbiological infections, but microbes {{have learned how}} to manipulate the autophagic pathway for their own benefit. The experimental evidence obtained in this study suggests that the autophagic <b>flux</b> is <b>blocked</b> at the final steps during the reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) from latency. This is indicated by the level of the lipidated form of LC 3 that does not increase in the presence of bafilomycin and by the lack of colocalization of autophagosomes with lysosomes, which correlates with reduced Rab 7 expression. Since the inhibition of the early phases of autophagy impaired EBV replication and viral particles were observed in autophagic vesicles in the cytoplasm of producing cells, we suggest that EBV exploits the autophagic machinery for its transportation in order to enhance viral production. The autophagic block was not mediated by ZEBRA, an immediate-early EBV lytic gene, whose transfection in Ramos, Akata, and 293 cells promoted a complete autophagic <b>flux.</b> The <b>block</b> occurred only when the complete set of EBV lytic genes was expressed. We suggest that the inhibition of the early autophagic steps or finding strategies to overcome the autophagic block, allowing viral degradation into the lysosomes, can be exploited to manipulate EBV replication. IMPORTANCE This study shows, for the first time, that autophagy is blocked at the final degradative steps during EBV replication in several cell types. Through this block, EBV hijacks the autophagic vesicles for its intracellular transportation and enhances viral production. A better understanding of virus-host interactions could help in the design of new therapeutic approaches against EBV-associated malignancies...|$|R

During voltage clamp ramps with [Ca 2 +](i) buffering, block of reverse mode block was slightly larger than of forward mode (by 25 +/- 5 %, P < 0. 05). In the absence of [Ca 2 +](i) buffering and with sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) <b>fluxes</b> <b>blocked,</b> rate constants for Ca 2 + influx and Ca 2 + efflux were reduced to the same extent (to 36 +/- 6 % and 32 +/- 4 %, respectively). With normal SR function the reduction of inward NCX current (I-NCX) was 57 +/- 10 % (n= 10); during large caffeine-induced Ca 2 + transients, it was larger (82 +/- 3 %). [Ca 2 +](i) transients evoked during depolarizing steps increased (from 424 +/- 27 to 994 +/- 127 nmol/L at + 10 mV, P < 0. 05), despite a reduction of I-CaL by 27 %. Resting [Ca 2 +](i) increased; there was a small decrease in the rate of decline of [Ca 2 +](i). SR Ca 2 + content increased more than 2 -fold. Contraction amplitude of field-stimulated myocytes increased in healthy myocytes but not in myocytes from MLP-/- mice, in which SR Ca 2 + content remained unchanged. These data provide proof-of-principle that even partial inhibition of NCX results in a net gain of Ca 2 +. Further development of NCX blockers, in particular, for heart failure, must balance potential benefits of I-NCX reduction against effects on Ca 2 + handling by refining mode dependence and/or including additional targets. status: publishe...|$|R

Although many genes and enzymes involved in lipid accumulation have been identified, much less is known of regulation of the overall process.

The biosynthetic pathway was divided into two blocks, connected by the intermediate acyl-CoAs.

This is evident in atmospheric reanalysis data, both modern and for the full 20 th century. Blocking is approximately in phase with Atlantic multidecadal ocean variability (AMV). Wintertime atmospheric blocking involves a highly distorted jetstream, isolating large regions of air from the westerly circulation.

40|$|Autophagy-lysosomal pathway is a {{cellular}} protective system to remove aggregated proteins and damaged organelles. Meanwhile, exosome secretion {{has emerged as}} a mode to selectively clear the neurotoxic proteins, such as α-synuclein. Mounting evidence suggests that these two cellular processes are coordinated to facilitate the clearance of toxic cellular waste; however the regulators for the transition between these two processes are unclear. Here we show that SCAMP 5, a secretory carrier membrane protein significantly induced in the brains of Huntington's disease patients, is quickly and transiently induced by protein stress and autophagic stimulation, and is regulated by the master autophagy transcriptional regulator TFEB. Ironically, SCAMP 5 inhibits autophagy <b>flux</b> by <b>blocking</b> the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Although autophagy is blocked, SCAMP 5 does not cause significant protein aggregation in cells. Instead, it promotes the Golgi fragmentation and stimulates the unconventional secretion of the co-localizing α-synuclein via exosome as an exosome component. Therefore, we have identified SCAMP 5 as a novel coordinator of autophagy and exosome secretion, which is induced upon protein stress to channel the efficient clearance of toxic proteins via the exosomes rather than autophagy-lysosomal pathway...|$|R
40|$|The P 2 X 7 {{receptor}} (P 2 X 7 R) {{is uniquely}} associated with two distinct cellular responses: activation of a dye-permeable pathway allowing passage of molecules up to 900  Da and rapid {{release of the}} pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), from activated macrophage. How this dye uptake path forms and whether it is involved in IL- 1 β release has not been known. Pannexin- 1 is a recently identified protein found to physically associate with the P 2 X 7 R. Inhibition of pannexin- 1 does not alter P 2 X 7 R ion channel activation or associated calcium <b>flux</b> but <b>blocks</b> one component of P 2 X 7 R-induced dye uptake and unmasks a slower, previously undetected, dye uptake pathway.

40|$|Melanoma {{is one of}} {{the most}} lethal cancers when it reaches a metastatic stage. Despite the {{spectacular}} achievements of targeted therapies (BRAF inhibitors) or immuno-therapies (anti-CTLA 4 or anti-PD 1), most patients with melanoma will need additional treatments. Here we used a photoactive NADPH analogue called NS 1 to induce cell death by inhibition of NADPH oxidases NOX in melanoma cells, including melanoma cells isolated from patients. In contrast, healthy melanocytes growth was unaffected by NS 1 treatment. NS 1 established an early Endoplasmic Reticulum stress by the early release of calcium mediated by (a) calcium-dependent redox-sensitive ion channel(s). These events initiated autophagy and apoptosis in all tested melanoma cells independently of their mutational status. The autophagy promoted by NS 1 was incomplete. The autophagic <b>flux</b> was <b>blocked</b> at late stage events, consistent with the accumulation of p 62, and a close localization of LC 3 with NS 1 associated with NS 1 inhibition of NOX 1 in autophagosomes. This hypothesis of a specific incomplete autophagy and apoptosis driven by NS 1 was comforted by the use of siRNAs and pharmacological inhibitors blocking different processes. This study highlights the potential therapeutic interest of NS 1 inducing cell death by triggering a selective ER stress and incomplete autophagy in melanoma cells harbouring wt and BRAF mutation...|$|R

40|$|Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) {{is a major}} {{polyphenol}} {{in green}} tea with beneficial effects on the impairment in learning and memory. Autophagy is a cellular process that protects neurons from stressful conditions. The present {{study was designed to}} investigate whether EGCG can rescue chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) -induced cognitive impairment in rats and whether its protective effect involves improvement of autophagic flux. As expected, our results showed that CUMS significantly impaired memory performance and inhibited autophagic flux as indicated by elevated LC 3 -II and p 62 protein levels. At the same time, we observed an increased neuronal loss and activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) /p 70 ribosomal protein S 6 kinase (p 70 S 6 k) signaling in the CA 1 regions. Interestingly, chronic treatment with EGCG (25 mg/kg, i. p.) significantly improved those behavioral alterations, attenuated histopathological abnormalities in hippocampal CA 1 regions, reduced amyloid beta 1 – 42 (Ab 1242) levels, and restored autophagic <b>flux.</b> However, <b>blocking</b> autophagic <b>flux</b> with chloroquine, an inhibitor of autophagic flux, reversed these effects of EGCG. Taken together, these findings suggest that the impaired autophagy in CA 1 regions of CUMS rats may contribute to learning and memory impairment. Therefore, we conclude that EGCG attenuation of CUMS-induced learning and memory impairment may be through rescuing autophagi...|$|R
40|$|The {{intracellular}} dialysis {{technique was}} used to measure unidirectional Cl- fluxes and net acid extrusion by single muscle fibers from the giant barnacle. Decreasing pHi below normal levels of 7. 35 stimulated both Cl- efflux and influx. These increases of Cl- <b>fluxes</b> were <b>blocked</b> by disulfonic acid stilbene derivatives such as SITS and DIDS. The SITS- sensitive Cl- efflux was sharply dependent upon pHi, increasing approximately 20 -fold as pHi was decreased from 7. 35 to 6. 7. Under conditions of normal intracellular Mg 2 + concentration, the apparent pKa for the activation of Cl- efflux was 7. 0. We found that raising [Mg 2 +]i, but not [Mg 2 +]o, had a pronounced inhibitory effect on both SITS-sensitive unidirectional Cl- fluxes as well as on SITS-sensitive net acid extrusion. Increasing [Mg 2 +]i shifted the apparent pKa of Cl- efflux to a more acid value without affecting the maximal flux that could be attained. This relation between pHi and [Mg 2 +]i on SITS- sensitive Cl- efflux is consistent with a competition between H ions and Mg ions. We conclude that the SITS-inhibitable Cl- fluxes are mediated by the pHi-regulatory transport mechanism and that changes of intracellular Mg 2 + levels can modify the activity of the pHi regulator/anion transporter...|$|R
