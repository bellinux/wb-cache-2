50|$|After being ousted as President of the Patriots in 1974 (despite owning {{more than}} 20% {{of the voting}} stock), Sullivan sought to regain control over operations. By 1975, Sullivan had repurchased 100% of the voting stock. Once {{in control of the}} corporation, Sullivan removed all {{directors}} of whom he disapproved. Notably, however, in order to pay back the loans required to purchase the voting-stock (more than 5.3M), Sullivan agreed with lenders to assign income of the corporation and assets of the corporation over to the banks. In order to do this, however, Sullivan needed to eliminate the non-voting public shareholders. Sullivan was successful in structuring a deal that provided the non-voting public shareholders $15/share; this transaction was approved by the shareholder class. A <b>dissenting</b> <b>shareholder</b> (a long time Patriots fan) refused to tender his shares and filed suit. Eventually, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court found the merger/elimination of the minority shareholders as illegal and effected for Sullivan's personal benefit. Additionally, the Court found that Sullivan's actions constituted a waste of corporate assets. It was ordered that the shareholders be paid the value of the shares, not in 1975 dollars but as the value would have stood in 1986 (the time of the ruling).|$|E
40|$|The capital {{maintenance}} rules {{stem from the}} English company law and were primarily aimed at protecting the rights of a company’s creditors. Before {{the introduction of the}} Companies Amendment Act 37 of 1998, a company was prohibited from purchasing its own shares. After this legislation was passed, a company was able to do so, provided that it satisfied the solvency and liquidity test and also complied with the new statutory provisions set out by sections 85 to 89 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973. Section 48 of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 now regulates the acquisition by a company of its own shares, as well as the acquisition of shares in its holding company by a subsidiary company. The above actions also fall under the ambit of a “distribution” as defined in the Act and therefore need to satisfy the requirements of section 46 of the Act as well. Unlike its predecessor, the provisions in the new Act are very broad and devoid of guidelines. The emphasis is placed on companies satisfying the principles of solvency and liquidity. Non-adherence to these provisions gives rise to the personal liability of the company’s directors. The provisions of section 48 do not apply where a <b>dissenting</b> <b>shareholder</b> exercises his appraisal rights in terms of section 164 of the new Act, or where a company redeems redeemable securities. These exceptions do, however, still amount to “distributions” and will accordingly need to satisfy the requirements contained in section 46 of the Act. Redeemable securities were initially not exempted from the provisions of section 48. This would potentially have given rise to a situation where a company could approach a court in terms of section 48 (6) to reverse a redemption of its securities. It would have had dire consequences for financing by way of redeemable securities. In terms of the Companies Amendment Act 3 of 2011 redeemable securities are now specifically exempted from the provisions of section 48. In terms of the new Act a subsidiary company is allowed to purchase shares in its holding company to a maximum of 10 % in the aggregate of the issued shares of any share class, provided that no voting rights attached to such shares may be exercised. The new Act fails to properly address some of the issues regarding the “round-tripping” of dividends and the declaration of a dividend in specie that were already identified as far back as 2001. Where the consideration for a repurchase constitutes a “dividend” as defined in the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962, the company will be liable to pay secondary tax on companies in respect thereof. If a distribution does not constitute a dividend, capital gains tax is payable with regard to it. Share repurchases are allowed in terms of Canadian corporate law after the legislative reform which occurred in that country during the 1970 ’s. The Canadian Business Corporations Act contains provisions that bear a striking resemblance to the provisions of the new Act adopted in South Africa. Whilst the basis and rationale behind the new corporate legislation cannot be faulted, a host of issues and concerns still remain. The unfortunate consequence is that the new Act lacks transparency and is fraught with clumsy errors. CopyrightDissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012. Mercantile Lawunrestricte...|$|E

Therefore, modern legislation in developed countries obliges companies to disclose a range of information regarding own shares, including the reasons for the acquisition.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} whether cumulative voting can help ease the conflicts between board of directors and minority shareholders. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use voting result of shareholder proposals as an indicator of the level of conflicts between board and minority shareholders. OLS regression and non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests have been applied in the analysis. Findings – It was found that cumulative voting can help ease the conflicts between board of directors and minority shareholders. Also, the tension between board and minority shareholders is affected by both corporate governance factors and a company's stock performance. Research limitations/implications – In general, the research result indicates that cumulative voting is still an effective mechanism that can lower investors' costs on monitoring boards of directors. Practical implications – Considering the huge amount of resources used in shareholder campaigns, the research result indicates that cumulative voting can be an efficient choice to alleviate the confrontation between <b>dissenting</b> <b>shareholders</b> and board of directors. Social implications – With the change of minority shareholder structure, it is necessary to examine whether the corporate world needs to reconsider the adoption of cumulative voting. Originality/value – The authors use a novel proxy, voting results of investor proposals, to measure the conflicts between board of directors and minority shareholders. This is also one of the few papers focusing on the monitoring cost side of the agency cost problem in corporate governance literature.

The role designated for RASDAQ was as platform for valuing papers issued in the privatization program in Romania (mass privatization process - MPP). In fact the participating companies to MPP had the legal obligation, under first Romanian Capital Market Law, No 52 / 1194, to be listed on a stock exchange. Although it attended a US regulatory model, RASDAQ had to adapt to European rules with the accession of Romania to the European Union. The relevant EU rules (i. e., Directive 2004 / 39 /EC on markets in financial instruments – MiFID, about {{to be replaced by}} Directive 2014 / 65 /EU – MiFID II) provide for only two types of trading systems, i. e. regulated markets and multilateral trading facilities (MTF), while the RASDAQ Market securities fall under none of these two trading systems regulated by MiFID 1.

The context of the study is the Directors' Remuneration Report (DRR) Regulations of 2002. This legislation gave shareholders a mandatory non-binding vote on boardroom pay in the UK. Research Findings/Insights: First, we find that less than 10 per cent of shareholders abstain or vote against the mandated Directors' Remuneration Report (DRR) resolution. This percentage is falling over time. Second, investors are more likely to vote against DRR resolutions compared to non-pay resolutions. Third, shareholders are more likely to vote against general executive pay resolutions, such as stock options, long-term incentive plans, and bonus resolutions compared to non-pay resolutions. Forth, firms with higher CEO pay attract greater voting dissent. Fifth, {{there is little evidence that}} CEO pay is lower in firms that previously experienced high levels of <b>shareholder</b> <b>dissent.</b> In addition, there is little evidence that the fraction of CEO equity pay, representing owner-manager alignment, is greater in such firms. Currently, we find limited evidence that, on average, “say on pay” materially alters the subsequent level and design of CEO compensation. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The study provides new insights on shareholder voting and CEO pay. Theoretically, shareholder voting is endogenously determined. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The study provides insights for practitioners and policy makers interested in shareholder rights, the effects on corporate governance, and say on pay in the UK.

Such targeted proxy access would incentivize boards to manage difficult operational and financial situations more proactively, while creating a reasonable oversight mechanism for shareholders if those efforts fail. The article also discusses ways for shareholders to use general proxy access in distressed situations to strengthen the shareholder perspective in, and add value to, boards’ negotiations with debtholders.

Further economies were put into effect - some of the 1881 cars were modified to remove the upper deck, stairs, and lower deck windows, to reduce the weight so that they could be operated by one horse rather than two.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the structure and}} effectiveness of board remuneration committees. The study provides evidence on factors that determine the voluntary adoption of corporate governance recommendations regarding remuneration committees in 2008. The findings indicate that remuneration committee existence is significantly associated with insider share ownership, institutional shareholding and marginally associated with change in CEO. Composition of the committee is significantly explained by independent directors and marginally explained by company complexity measured by geographical segments. The results suggest that agency costs and board capacity are incrementally relevant to adoption of the ASX remuneration committee recommendations, after controlling for company characteristics related to company size, governance quality, {{the appointment of a}} big 4 auditor and leverage. The results also indicate that companies are less likely to adopt the ASX remuneration committee recommendations in response to <b>shareholder</b> <b>dissent</b> on the annual remuneration report. The analysis then considers the association between adoption of the ASX remuneration committee recommendations and executive remuneration. Contrary to theoretical predications, the results infer that adoption of the ASX remuneration committee recommendations does not universally lead to more effective remuneration practices.

40|$|Institutional {{investors are}} often criticized for their {{insufficient}} “engagement”with listed companies. Actually, information and other transaction costs limit {{their capacity to}} actively monitor investee firms, and to engage with their management. A partial solution is offered by Proxy Advisors (PAs), providing proxy voting services on a subscription basis. We use Say-On-Pay (SOP) in Italian listed firms to investigate PA activity and (institutional) shareholder voting behavior. Making use of a unique dataset, including information on how each shareholder voted in 2012, we analyze the behavior of different classes of shareholders and their relation with PA recommendations. Our main results can be summarized as follows: i) while <b>shareholder</b> <b>dissent</b> on SOP is low, {{in line with what}} happens in other developed countries, dissent by institutional investors is surprisingly high; ii) the voting behavior of institutional investors is strongly correlated with PA recommendations. The influence of PAs is higher on nonblockholders (mostly internationally diversified pension and mutual funds) than on blockholders; iii) preliminary estimates show that the influence of PAs in Italy is at least as strong as (and probably stronger than) that observed in the US. This is coherent with the weight of non-domestic institutions, which can be hardly expected to independently analyze thousands of firms; and it is especially so in Italy, where most listed firms may be classified as small/medium cap firms on a comparative basis; iv) institutional investors, however, do not take PA recommendations at face value, but focus on the specific reasons of concern underlined in the reports (in particular, on the structure and long-term value creation of the remuneration policy).

40|$|Say on pay" gives {{shareholders}} {{an advisory}} {{vote on a}} company's pay practices for its top executives. Beginning in 2011, Dodd-Frank mandated such votes at public companies. The first year of "say on pay" under the new legislation may have changed the dialogue and give-and-take in the shareholder-management relationship at some companies, particularly {{on the question of}} executive pay. We study the evolution of shareholder voting on "say on pay" - beginning in 2006 as a fledgling shareholder movement to get "say on pay" on the corporate ballot, evolving as a handful of companies and later the financial firms receiving TARP funds conducted "say on pay" votes, and leading to Dodd-Frank’s extension of the process to all public companies. Using results from an empirical analysis of data from the pre-Dodd-Frank period, we project that the new mandatory management-sponsored "say on pay" proposals will attract strong shareholder support at most companies, while poorly performing companies with high pay levels can expect <b>shareholder</b> <b>dissent.</b> These projections are confirmed by early results {{in the first year of}} post-Dodd-Frank experience with "say on pay". Our empirical analysis of the pre-Dodd-Frank data supports the potential importance of third party voting advisor recommendations, particularly by the ISS, on executive pay proposals. The raw data show 20 percent swing in shareholder support for management "say on pay" proposals associated with a negative ISS recommendation. However, once we take into account the different recommendations issued by management and ISS, the net effect of an ISS negative recommendation on the overall shareholder vote is relatively small at most companies. Nevertheless, the early Dodd-Frank results show that all 37 companies that failed to obtain majority support in these advisory votes had received negative ISS recommendations. The early results show that companies that initially received negative "say on pay" recommendations by the ISS often modified their disclosure filings or changed their pay practices. This may indicate a growing role for shareholders in influencing executive pay practices and corporate governance more generally...|$|R
