I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>it.</b> I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E

[...] The Observers Luke Bainbridge, however, referred to the song as [...] "a grinding instant smash".

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Led Zeppelin II was not positive originally.

Robert Christgau jokingly referred to the band as [...] "the best of the wah-wah [...] groups, so dirty they drool on demand", while complaining that [...] "all the songs sound alike". He nonetheless conceded that [...] "Led Zeppelin simply out-heavied everyone" [...] in 1969, [...] "pitting Jimmy Page's repeated low-register fuzz riffs against the untiring freak intensity of Robert Plant's vocal.

500|$|Verdi {{conducted}} his Requiem in Paris, London and Vienna in 1875 and in Cologne in 1876. It {{seemed that}} it would be his last work. In the words of his biographer John Rosselli, it [...] "confirmed him as the unique presiding genius of Italian music. No fellow composer...came near him in popularity or reputation". Verdi, now in his sixties, initially seemed to withdraw into retirement. He deliberately shied away from opportunities to publicise himself or to become involved with new productions of his works, but secretly he began work on Otello, which Boito (to whom the composer had been reconciled by Ricordi) had proposed to him privately in 1879. The composition was delayed by a revision of Simon Boccanegra which Verdi undertook with Boito, produced in 1881, and a revision of Don Carlos. Even when Otello was virtually completed, Verdi teased [...] "Shall I finish it? Shall <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> performed? Hard to tell, even for me." [...] As news leaked out, Verdi was pressed by opera houses across Europe with enquiries; eventually the opera was triumphantly premiered at La Scala in February 1887.|$|E
