40|$|Pneumonic {{pasteurellosis}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important economically infectious diseases of ruminants with a wide prevalence throughout the continents. The disease is characterized by an acute febrile course with severe fibrinous or fibrino-purulent bronchopneumonia, fibrinous pleurisy, and septicaemia (Mohammed and Abdelsalam, 2008). M. haemolytica, P. trehalosi, and P. multocida are common commensal organisms of the tonsils and nasopharynx of healthy sheep and goats. They are non-motile gram-negative rods that cause cranioventral bronchopneumonia affecting sheep and <b>goats</b> of <b>all</b> <b>ages</b> worldwide (Cynthia and Scott, 2012). Infections from these pathogens are associat-ed with poor management practices and occur as...|$|R
40|$|The Caprine Arthritis-Encephalitis Virus (CAEV) is able {{to infect}} <b>goats</b> of <b>all</b> <b>ages,</b> breeds, and in all locations. It is {{particularly}} devastating to goat populations and represents a major economic problem for goat farming worldwide as goats are {{a major source of}} sustenance and trade among most of the world. Finding a way to effectively inactivate and immunize for CAEV is crucial to maintain healthy goat populations and prevent a potential global economic crash among goat farming. The most common way to inactivate CAEV is to perform heat treatment of colostrum however this may disrupt the anti-viral effects that colostrum naturally maintains. The Trujillo lab sets out to find better alternatives, if any, to treat the colostrum, or if the colostrum needs treated to kill CAEV at all. Studies done in lab have suggested that colostrum exhibits a very high efficiency of inactivating CAEV on its own and may not need treatment to pass on immunity. We test different strains of virus on colostrum and calculate a titer that will hopefully help us determine how effective colostrum is at inactivating CAEV and we also will perform a test by challenging live kids to determine the outcome...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of strain and sex on body weight (BW) and linear body measurements [body length (BL), height-at-withers (HW), and heart girth (HG) ] and their relationships in sex groups (1 - 6, 7 - 12, 13 - 18, 19 - 24, 25 - 30, and 31 - 36 months) were studied in 720 smallholder Maradi goats of Nigeria. Sex significantly (P < 0. 05) influenced BW, BL, HW, and HG at 25 - 30 and 31 - 36 months; 7 - 12 months; 7 - 12, 25 - 30, and 31 - 36 months; and 25 - 30 and 31 - 36 months, respectively. Males weighed heavier and had wider HG than females at maturity, but females had longer and higher BL and HW, respectively, at 7 - 12 months. Strain significantly (P < 0. 05) influenced BW, BL, HW, and HG, except at 7 - 12 and 13 - 18 months; 13 - 18 months; 25 - 30 and 31 - 36 months; and 7 - 12 and 13 - 18 months, respectively. Brown and light brown goats were predominantly heavier in BW and had higher HW. Body weight was significantly (P < 0. 01, p < 0. 001) and {{positively correlated with}} BL (0. 74, 0. 63, 0. 60, 0. 63, and 0. 65), HW (0. 79, 0. 60, 0. 51, 0. 47, and 0. 46) and HG (0. 72, 0. 57, 0. 76, 0. 72, and 0. 75). Based on {{the magnitude of the}} correlations, HG and BL could be used to estimate BW of Maradi <b>goats</b> across <b>all</b> <b>ages...</b>|$|R
40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the safety of {{moxidectin}} for goats were tested in six experiments, where two pharmaceutical forms (1 % injectable solution and 0. 1 % oral drench) of the drug were used. In experiments I and II, the drug was administered to adult goats or to kids in the following doses: 300, 600, 900 and 2 x 300 mug kg(- 1). In experiments III and IV, the drug was administered to goats before and during pregnancy in the dose of 300 mug kg(- 1). In experiments V and VI, the drug was administered to goats concurrently with an enterotoxaemia vaccine or with a flukicide in the dose of 300 mug kg(- 1). An increased (P < 0. 05) prevalence of animals with adverse reactions was recorded among adult goats, which received 900 mug kg(- 1) of moxidectin 1 % injectable solution and among kids which received 600 or 900 mug kg(- 1) of moxidectin 1 % injectable solution or 900 mug kg(- 1) moxidectin 0. 1 % oral drench. The salient reactions of the animals were: indifference to the environment, drowsiness, somnolence, salivation, ataxia and refusal of kids to suck their dams; they were observed 4 - 8 h after administration of the drug and regressed within 36 h after it. No other statistically significant adverse reactions were observed among experimental animals; no adverse reproductive effects were recorded; no effects were observed during simultaneous administration of the enterotoxaemia vaccine or the flukicide. It is concluded that although the drug appears to be safe for use to <b>goats</b> of <b>all</b> <b>ages</b> and reproductive stages, care {{should be taken to}} avoid inadverted overdosing.

40|$|We {{studied the}} factors that {{determined}} kidney fat stores (KFs) and kidney stores (Ks) -defined as the residuals from the linear regression of kidney mass and kidney fat, respectively, on body weight-in 463 Iberian wild goats (Capra pyrenaica) from the Sierra Nevada (southern Spain). Despite the fact that body stores in both sexes were highest during the warmest {{months of the year}} and lowest during the coldest months when food resources are limited, the observed pattern was sex- and age-dependent. The KFs of male goats fell more than those of females in winter, and the yearlings of both sexes needed one season more than young or adults to restore their KFs. <b>Goats</b> of <b>all</b> <b>age</b> classes showed the same seasonal patterns in their Ks, although Ks were lower in females than in males throughout the yearly cycle. In addition, we found strong delayed effects of both snowfalls and population density on body stores, and in years with a lot of snow, goats' KFs reached their lowest levels in the current winter-spring, but the highest in the following summers and autumns. This pattern was less noticeable in the Ks. Population density negatively affected the body stores of wild goats, especially in winter, and the amount of snow fallen in the year of birth (cohort effect) did not seem to influence the body stores in our data set. In addition, we assessed the accuracy of the residuals from the regression between body size and body mass for monitoring body condition of live wild goats and concluded that, although it poorly indicates fat stores, it {{could be used as a}} general proxy of body condition. Finally, we discuss the expected effects of climate warming on body stores in this Mediterranean Caprinae species. © 2010 Springer-Verlag. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
