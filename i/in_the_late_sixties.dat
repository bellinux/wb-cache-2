5|$|During his 1965-1966 world tour, Dylan {{was backed}} by a five-member rock group, The Hawks, who would later become famous as The Band. After Dylan was injured in a {{motorcycle}} accident in July 1966, four members of The Hawks came to Dylan's home in the Woodstock area to collaborate with him on music and film projects. While Dylan {{was out of the}} public's eye during an extended period of recovery in 1967, he and the members of The Hawks recorded more than 100 tracks together, incorporating original compositions, contemporary covers, and traditional material. Dylan's new style of writing moved away from the urban sensibility and extended narratives that had characterized his most recent albums, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde, toward songs that were more intimate and which drew on many styles of traditional American music. While some of the basement songs are humorous, others dwell on nothingness, betrayal and a quest for salvation. In general, they possess a rootsy quality anticipating the Americana genre. For some critics, the songs on The Basement Tapes, which circulated widely in unofficial form, mounted a major stylistic challenge to rock music <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>sixties.</b>|$|E

25|$|Direct {{conversion}} This is {{a method}} where the kinetic energy of a particle is converted into voltage. It was first suggested by Richard F. Post in conjunction with magnetic mirrors, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>sixties.</b> It has also been suggested for Field-Reversed Configurations. The process takes the plasma, expands it, and converts a large fraction of the random energy of the fusion products into directed motion. The particles are then collected on electrodes at various large electrical potentials. This method has demonstrated an experimental efficiency of 48 percent.|$|E
25|$|The {{highlight}} of the late 60s was the run to the 1968 Scottish Cup Final when they lost 3–1 to George Farm's Dunfermline Athletic. The players of greatest note <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>sixties</b> were Jim Cruickshank, Alan Anderson and Donald Ford with Drew Busby joining the three in the 1970s. The high point of the 1970s was another run to the Scottish Cup Final. In 1975–76 they again lost 3–1 in the final this time to Rangers. After {{the advent of the}} ten team Premier Division in 1975, Hearts were subsequently relegated {{for the first time in}} 1977. This began a sequence of yo-yoing between the Premier League and First Division six times in seven seasons.|$|E

The Park Royal Shopping Centre, in West Vancouver, {{became the first}} in the city in 1950 and Empire Stadium, was built to host the 1954 British Empire Games. Vancouver became the western anchor of the new CBC national television network in 1958 and the western hub of the newly completed Trans-Canada Highway in 1962. The giant Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal, was built in 1959 for passenger and vehicle ferry service to southern Vancouver Island and the nearby Roberts Bank Superport coal terminal was finished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>sixties.</b> A second, Second Narrow's Bridge was built in 1960 and the W.A.C.

25|$|The OW {{originated}} in Brazil with de Morais' 1954 Recife workshop. In {{the wake of}} the coup d'état of March 1964, de Morais went into a 23-year exile in Chile, and the OW spread from there <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>sixties.</b> After specializing in Cultural Anthropology (Santiago University) and in Land Reform at the ICIRA (Capacitation and Research Institute for Agrarian Reform Institute), de Morais became consultant for international and national development institutions and NGOs. Since then, the organization workshop has become a constant in a number of agrarian reform efforts in Latin America and (community) development projects elsewhere. From Chile, the OW spread to Costa Rica, Mexico, Panamá, Colombia, El Salvador, Venezuela, Ecuador, Honduras, Peru, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Brazil, the Caribbean, a number of African countries as well as Europe. In 2015, {{for the first time in}} the UK, a pilot OW took place at 'Marsh Farm' urban housing Estate, Luton (near London) as part of a government supported Enterprise and Job creation project.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} the high profile murders that shook Los Angeles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>sixties.</b> The murders were {{committed}} by members of Charles Manson's cult and {{came to be known}} as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. On January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.|$|E

2500|$|Amid the Cold War, the United States {{entered the}} Vietnam War, whose growing unpopularity fed already {{existing}} social movements, including those among women, minorities, and young people.

Fleetwood Mac's Gold Dust Woman features the instrument, as well. Many pop performances actually involve the Electric Sitar, a solid body guitar-like instrument quite different from the traditional acoustic Indian instrument.|$|E
