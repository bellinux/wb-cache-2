40|$|A {{physical}} model is proposed {{to predict the}} critical grain size at which nanocrystalline FCC metals reach a maximum steady state flow stress. The model considers that nanocrystalline metals are composed of two phases. One is the <b>grain</b> boundary <b>phase</b> {{and the other is}} the <b>grain</b> interior <b>phase.</b> The <b>grain</b> boundary <b>phase</b> has specific deformation mechanism different to the <b>grain</b> interior <b>phase.</b> The critical <b>grain</b> size with the maximum steady state flow stress is predicted to decrease with deformation temperature and to increase with strain rate.
