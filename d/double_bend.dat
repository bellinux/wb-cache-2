2500|$|On March 14, the {{flotilla}} {{continued its}} descent arriving at Hickman, Kentucky at 5 P.M., some twenty-five miles below Columbus, where Foote decided to anchor for the night. On {{the morning of}} March 15, the flotilla continued on. Foote, and Phelps arrived aboard the [...] Benton and encountered the Confederate steamer CSS Grampus which unexpectedly appeared through the fog. Alarmed, Grumpus stopped its engines and struck its colors, but her commander then quickly changed his mind, turned about and headed downriver, with Benton firing shells that fell short of her stern. [...] Moving on they spotted a chain of batteries of at least 50 heavy guns, which extended four miles along the crescent shaped Tennessee shore, thwarting any further passage. The Benton continued slowly while Phelps discerned the trees along the bank for possible hiding places for shore batteries, sometimes firing into suspected areas. Upon discovering no hidden guns, the Benton stopped at the <b>double</b> <b>bend</b> in the river, where several other vessels were docked, along with a floating shore battery. After determining {{that there were no}} Confederates about, a tug was dispatched to place and tie up mortar boats. At 1 o'clock in the afternoon, the mortar boats commenced firing upon the island, with the Benton joining the bombardment two hours later. Red Rover and other Confederate vessels moved out in retreat. With Confederate guns silent, Phelps boarded a tugboat and took it down stream, turning into and out of range of Confederate batteries, hoping to draw their fire and revealing their strength. With no response from the Confederates, Phelps returned upstream to the Benton, where he spent the remainder of the afternoon firing shells at nearby Forts Thompson and Bankhead.|$|E
60|$|We {{arrived at}} Fokado at half-past four, getting {{in half an}} hour before our baggage, which had been eight hours and a half upon the road, and quite {{determined}} that in future, whatever labour it involved, we would not again let it out of our sight. The break-down of a baggage-animal, if one is at hand oneself to see that one’s servants instantly and properly reload it, is an affair of ten minutes at most; but if the servants are left to their own devices, it will occupy over half-an-hour. First of all there are ten minutes wasted in deploring the calamity, another ten in undoing the cords, and at least twenty more in repacking and getting under way. Fokado, like all our camping-stations, lies in a slight basin; this basin is, {{like the rest of the}} plateau-land, covered with long grass. A dozen men with scythes could cut enough in a day to supply a cavalry regiment; but they would have to be very careful to choose such portions of the plain as are not covered with stones. As it is, the grass-cutters are supplied with very small sickles, which do very well to hack off a bunch of grass, but which are of little use towards getting in any large quantity. Fortunately the natives cut and bring it in in considerable amount, and I am able to purchase an abundance from them; for no forage is issued by the commissariat for our baggage-animals, and it would be out of the question to expect our syces to go out and cut grass after a long and fatiguing day’s march. There is a well at Fokado from which plenty of cool and moderately-pure water is obtained. After having seen my tent erected and my rations drawn and on the fire, I walked on with two or three officers of the 33d to see the church. It stood, as most of the churches here do, upon slightly-rising ground, and was surrounded by a high wall, with the gateway entering beneath a sort of tower. Having paid my dollar—the modest tariff here demanded for admission—I entered the enclosure. It was in a state of the utmost disorder; loose boulders and stones were strewn everywhere, and I saw no signs whatever of graves. This was the case in the other three churches I have since visited, and is the more singular as the graveyards I saw and described coming up the pass, and which were those of the Mahometan tribes who inhabit that part of the country, were so carefully constructed and so religiously preserved. I have not seen a single grave since I entered the Christian part of Abyssinia. Near the church-door was a framework of three cross-poles, and from this were suspended, by straw ropes, two large stones of sonorous qualities. These were the church-bells. The church itself was a low edifice, built of rough stones, with large blocks forming the door-frame. Entering, I found myself in a low chamber, the roof being supported by four rough stone columns. The floor was littered down with rushes, and had exactly the appearance of a stable. On the wall was a rude half-length fresco of the Virgin, squinting terribly; and on the door leading to the next chamber was a skin or parchment with a somewhat similar painting. Having bowed deeply before each of these portraits at the request of the officiating priest, I was admitted into the next chamber, which was precisely similar to the first, but, having no windows, it only received such light as came in through the crevices of the doors. There was some demur as to my entering the next chamber, which indeed had been refused to all the officers who had been previously there; but I pointed to my white solar hat; and this and the fact of my not being in uniform convinced them, I believe, that I was a priest; for I should mention that the Abyssinian priests are distinguished by wearing white turbans, all the rest of the population going bare-headed. I was therefore admitted into the holy of holies. This was a more lofty chamber than the others, and was lighted by a window high up on the side wall. Across the room, at a distance of about a yard from the door, hung a screen about six feet high; this screen was made of roughly-embroidered canvas, and was apparently intended to prevent the eyes of the worshippers in the second chamber catching a glimpse of the penetralia when the door was opened. Looking round the end of this curtain, I saw an erection resembling a painter’s easel. A parchment or skin was stretched across the upper portion, and on this probably was a painting of some sort; but as it was wrapped up in a cloth, I was unable to examine it, as I was not allowed to go beyond the line of the screen. Returning, I noticed in one corner of the first chamber some long sticks, with a <b>double</b> <b>bend</b> at the top; that is, resembling in form a cross, with the top piece broken off. These are used in the service. Near them, in a niche in the wall, were some pieces of iron fastened together so as to make a jingling noise when shaken. These, no doubt, supply the place of the bell at the raising of the host. I have omitted to say that in the churchyard were two rough fonts; they were round blocks of stone, about two feet and a half high and eighteen inches in diameter; the hollow at the top for water was about eight inches deep. I have seen no fonts in the other churches I have entered.|$|E

40|$|Knot {{strength}} {{is very important}} in processing ropes than other textile products. Thus <b>double</b> sheet <b>bends</b> are usually used in rope mills, because their knots are small and strong in order to tie two threads of yarn. These knots have been made by manual operation. These mills, therefore, are demanding {{to be able to make}} these knots automatically in order to improve process efficiency. In this study, we have developed a knotter which is able to form a <b>double</b> sheet <b>bend</b> by using a set of molds. First, we designed a path to carve tracks on the surface of the mold by using the Dowker notation. But this path was too complicated to thread yarn through the path easily. Furthermore, it is desired that the knotter can be carried by a worker in rope mills. We, therefore, have moved and/or composed paths in order to obtain the simpler path for <b>double</b> sheet <b>bends.</b> Finally, we have integrated these molds and instruments such as air cylinders and linear guide ways in order to make a <b>double</b> sheet <b>bend</b> knot automatically. © 2008 The Textile Machinery Society of Japan...|$|R

50|$|The Chasman-Green lattice, {{also known}} as a <b>double</b> <b>bend</b> achromat lattice (DBA lattice), is a special {{periodic}} arrangement of magnets designed by Renate Chasman and George Kenneth Green of Brookhaven National Laboratory in the mid-1970s for synchrotrons. This lattice provides optimized bending and focusing of electrons in storage rings designed for synchrotron light sources. An electron storage ring constructed with a Chasman-Green lattice has the important property that the circulating electron beams have very low emittance, which results in the emission of synchrotron light of exceptional brightness. For this reason it is the lattice of choice for most of the premier synchrotron light source facilities worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Towards the {{northern}} end of the washes, the New Bedford River is joined by the River Delph at Welmore Lake Sluice. The origins of this channel, which is sometimes called the thirty-foot drain, are obscure, although it was built to assist the removal of water from the washlands, according to C. N. Cole writing in 1784. Prior to 1825, there was a dam where the sluice is located, and water was let out of the washland by cutting a slot in it, which the flood water enlarged as it passed through. The cost of rebuilding the dam {{at the end of the}} process was considerable, and this unsatisfactory arrangement was replaced by a sluice. At the same time, the New Bedford River was made wider and deeper, while some of the flood banks were also raised. At its southern end, the River Delph is connected to the Old Bedford River at a <b>double</b> <b>bend</b> near Welches Dam. The northern half of the Old Bedford River is no longer connected to its southern half. It is not known exactly when this configuration was built, although it may have been between 1789 and 1821, since Cole's map of 1789 shows the Old Bedford River proceeding in a straight line, and Baker's map of 1821 shows two rivers, each with a <b>double</b> <b>bend.</b> Blair argues for a date soon after the New Bedford River was built, however, since Welches Dam is named after Edmund Welche, who worked with Vermuyden, and the dam in question was originally built across the Old Bedford River.|$|E

40|$|The As Pontes basin (12 km 2), NW Iberian Peninsula, is {{bounded by}} a <b>double</b> {{restraining}} <b>bend</b> of a dextral strike-slip fault, which {{is related to}} the western onshore end of the Pyrenean belt. Surface and subsurface data obtained from intensive coal exploration and mining in the basin since the 1960 s together with additional structural and stratigraphic sequence analysis allowed us to determine the geometric relationships between tectonic structures and stratigraphic markers. The small size of the basin and the large amount of quality data make the As Pontes basin a unique natural laboratory for improving our understanding of the origin and evolution of restraining <b>bends.</b> The <b>double</b> restraining <b>bend</b> is the end stage of the structural evolution of a compressive underlapping stepover, where the basin was formed. During the first stage (stepover stage), which began ca. 30 Ma ago (latest Rupelian) and lasted 3. 4 My, two small isolated basins bounded by thrusts and normal faults were formed. For 1. 3 My, the strike-slip faults, which defined the stepover, grew towards each other until joining and forming the <b>double</b> restraining <b>bend,</b> which bounds one large As Pontes basin (transition stage). The history of the basin was controlled by the activity of the <b>double</b> restraining <b>bend</b> for a further 3. 4 My (restraining bend stage) and ended in mid-Aquitanian times (ca. 22 Ma) ...|$|R

50|$|A rare grip used {{in modern}} tennis, it is a hybrid between {{the eastern and}} semi-western {{forehand}} grips. Its main purpose is a modification over the traditional eastern grip to help develop more spin on the forehand, and thus gives a player more control and options over their shot than a conventional eastern grip. It's a very versatile grip, allowing multiple ways of hitting the ball, such as the <b>double</b> <b>bend</b> arm or the straight arm, and can be further modified with the wrist and forearm movement for added spin and power. It {{also can be used}} to flatten out the ball for a finishing shot or roll over the ball for a more consistent topspin shot without having to change grips. It does however, take a bit longer to master than other forehand grips due to its unique nature and more traditional style, but will present more options when faced with any type of shot.|$|E
