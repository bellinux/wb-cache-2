5|$|Marcinkus {{arrived in}} France <b>in</b> <b>mid-March</b> 1940 and {{immediately}} requested acceptance into the French Air Force. Bureaucratic delays hindered his enlistment. By the time these hurdles were cleared, the Battle for France was rapidly {{drawing to a}} close. It is possible, however, that Marcinkus succeeded in shooting down several German military planes during his short career in the French air force.|$|E
5|$|On February 12, 2013, the album's {{title was}} {{revealed}} as Super Collider. About two weeks later, Mustaine announced several song titles in an interview, discussing {{some of those}} songs in the process. Mustaine also revealed that fourteen songs were being worked on in total. Recording for the album was completed <b>in</b> <b>mid-March.</b>|$|E

On 23 March, {{he was promoted}} to Staffelkapitän (squadron leader) of 9./JG52 after his predecessor was shot down behind enemy lines and taken prisoner. The rains returned in April, bringing the muds of the rasputitsa. Aerial activity virtually stopped as both sides took the opportunity to regroup.|$|E
5|$|Audition was {{released}} theatrically in Japan on March 3, 2000. It received its American premier at the Seattle International Film Festival in 2000. The film was first screened outside Festivals in the United States in early August 2001. In the United Kingdom, Audition received screenings in 2000 at both FrightFest and the Raindance Film Festival. It {{was released}} theatrically in the United Kingdom by Metro Tartan <b>in</b> <b>mid-March</b> 2001. It was Miike's first film {{to be released}} theatrically in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Beaujeu, having {{fulfilled}} {{his mission}} in escorting the colonists across the ocean, returned to France aboard the Joly <b>in</b> <b>mid-March</b> 1685. Many of the colonists chose {{to return to}} France with him, leaving approximately 180. Although Beaujeu delivered a message from La Salle requesting additional supplies, French authorities, having made peace with Spain, never responded. The remaining colonists suffered from dysentery and venereal diseases, and people died daily. Those who were fit helped build crude dwellings and a temporary fort on Matagorda Island.|$|E

But simultaneously, in another proceeding, Nagin had been defending his own e-mails from disclosure, whereupon Times-Picayune columnist Stephanie Grace accused him of [...] "inconsistency" [...] and noted a similar behavior with respect to New Orleans Katrina-recovery czar Ed Blakely; Grace wrote: ...|$|R
50|$|Following World War II, LST-985 {{performed}} occupation {{duty in the}} Far East and saw service <b>in</b> China until <b>mid-March</b> 1946.

Skinner for scrapping.|$|R
5|$|Construction on re-theming {{the queue}} {{began in the}} third quarter of 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, the ride closed in order to {{refurbish}} the attraction to incorporate the Harry Potter theme. <b>In</b> <b>mid-March</b> 2010, the roller coasters reopened to the public. On June 18, 2010, with the opening of the entire The Wizarding World of Harry Potter section, the ride officially became Dragon Challenge.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>mid-March</b> recent successes by U-boats {{caused the}} Admiralty to {{transfer}} destroyers from the Home Fleet to escort duties in the North Atlantic. Fury {{was one of}} these and was assigned to the 4th Escort Group. In April the group escorted Convoys HX 231, HX 234 and ONS 5 (where they drove off attacking U-boat wolfpacks). In May she escorted ON 184 before beginning a brief refit on the Humber.|$|E
5|$|In the 1993–94 season, the Bulls, without Jordan, {{achieved}} a 55–27 record, {{and lost to}} the New York Knicks {{in the second round}} of the playoffs. But the 1994–95 Bulls were a shell of the championship team of just two years earlier. Struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs, Chicago was 31–31 at one point <b>in</b> <b>mid-March.</b> The team received help, however, when Jordan decided to return to the NBA for the Bulls.|$|E

5000|$|In October 2016, an {{outbreak}} of cholera began in Yemen. The outbreak was <b>in</b> decline by <b>mid-March</b> 2017, but it has resurged since 27 April 2017, and remains ongoing as of July 2017. The resurgence is reportedly partly because the sewer system in the capital city, Sana'a, ceased functioning after airstrikes following Saudi intervention in the Yemeni Civil War.|$|R

5|$|In {{a game in}} Boston in January of the 1952–53 season Kennedy {{suffered}} a separated shoulder in a scuffle with Milt Schmidt of the Bruins and underwent surgery. Originally thought lost for the season, Kennedy trained hard {{and was able to}} return to the Leafs <b>in</b> <b>mid-March.</b> However, Toronto still finished out of a playoff position. Despite missing more than two months of the schedule Kennedy still finished second in points on the team. For his efforts Kennedy received the J. P. Bickell Memorial Trophy which is awarded by the Maple Leaf Gardens board of directors as the player most valuable to the Leafs.|$|E
5|$|In early March, Camacho {{resigned}} {{after three}} consecutive league draws, citing {{his inability to}} motivate the club. His assistant Fernando Chalana then took over, but Benfica continued to disappoint; they were eliminated in the UEFA Cup and mired in second place <b>in</b> <b>mid-March.</b> In April, the situation deteriorated further; Benfica matched their worst league defeat in 60 years, slipped to fourth place and was knocked out of the Portuguese Cup by Sporting CP. An away draw in May's opening game left the club dangerously close to finishing fourth. One week later, fans had the bitter-sweet experience of celebrating Rui Costa's final match and seeing Benfica finish fourth, their worst finish since 2001–02.|$|E
50|$|The Infrastructure Consortium for Africa (ICA) was {{established}} at the 31st G8 summit at Gleneagles, Scotland in the United Kingdom in 2005. Since that time, the ICA’s annual meeting is traditionally hosted by the country holding the Presidency of the G8. The 2008 meeting was held in Tokyo in March 2008, and the 2009 meeting is planned for <b>mid-March</b> <b>in</b> Rome.|$|R
30|$|Simultaneous {{observations}} {{with other}} satellites and ground observation networks {{will be important}} in future studies. In particular, cooperative observations with the Van Allen Probes, THEMIS (Angelopoulos 2008) and MMS (Burch et al. 2016) will allow comprehensive understanding of plasma wave generation and propagation characteristics in the inner magnetosphere. Conjugate observations of the Arase satellite and the ground observation network are also important in clarifying particle precipitation processes, as consequences of wave–particle interactions. When the nominal operation of the Arase began <b>in</b> the <b>mid-March,</b> 2017, campaign observations were conducted with ground observation networks, such as EISCAT and the PWING project (Shiokawa et al. 2017). We expect comparisons of the simultaneous observation data from these ground-network stations with Arase data will produce many new scientific achievements.|$|R
50|$|Between 23 March and 18 April, some clashes also {{occurred}} in the remote eastern Lapland. The Karelian nationalist Iivo Ahava was fighting against the Whites who launched the Viena expedition in order to annex the Russian White Karelia into the newly independent Finland. Ahava formed a Red Guard unit in the Russian town of Kandalaksha of the Reds who had fled from Lapland. Two other Finnish Red Guards were formed in Knyazhaya Guba and Kem. <b>In</b> the <b>mid-March,</b> these units had up to 2,500 men. Ahava managed to stop the Whites {{and he was also}} eager to attack their rear in the northern Finland. However, the Red leaders were not interested in supporting him as they considered that the war would be determined in the populated areas of south.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to political humiliation caused by de Havilland Mosquito bombing raids into Germany, Hermann Göring ordered {{the formation of}} special high-altitude Luftwaffe units (Jagdgeschwader 25, commanded by Ihlefeld and Jagdgeschwader 50, under Graf) to combat these attacks. <b>In</b> <b>mid-March,</b> Graf was ordered to Berchtesgarden, Hitler’s alpine retreat, where he received his instructions from Göring personally. Graf was permitted to choose his personnel. He transferred his old friends, Grislawski, Süss and Füllgrabe, from III./ JG52, {{as well as a}} number of football players serving as administrators in his JGr Ost training unit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} match of January, Benfica lost to Sporting CP and {{underwent}} another erratic period, losing two more league matches in February. A home win against Liverpool motivated them; they beat Porto and eliminated the reigning title-holders from the Champions League. This success was not replicated domestically; <b>in</b> <b>mid-March,</b> Benfica lost further {{ground in the}} Primeira Liga and were eliminated from the Portuguese Cup. Koeman's side recovered, but they were eliminated by Barcelona from the Champions League and failed to overtake Sporting when they dropped seven points in three match-days. At {{the end of the}} season, Koeman left the club by mutual consent.|$|E
5|$|International: sedans and Sportwagons entered {{production}} <b>in</b> <b>mid-March</b> 2009.

Holden reintroduced the International in October 2009. Offered in sedan and Sportwagon body styles, the second iteration was fitted with the 3.0-litre SIDI V6 engine and six-speed automatic transmission; a 3.6-litre LPG Alloytec V6 engine with four-speed automatic transmission option {{was available for}} the sedan only. Extra features include 18-inch alloy wheels, Berlina front grille, leather seat trim and steering wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist for the sedan (already standard on Sportwagons).|$|E

50|$|From mid-February to mid-March, {{the limited}} edition of Twinkle Crusaders was the eighth most pre-ordered title, {{according}} to a Japanese national ranking of PC games. It was then ranked as the most pre-ordered title <b>in</b> Japan from <b>mid-March</b> to mid-April, the fifth from mid-April to mid-May. The game was also the second most pre-ordered game from mid-May to mid-June, only falling behind Little Busters! Ecstasy, after which the game was again placed as the most pre-ordered title in Japan for two consecutive months.|$|R

5|$|Nagato was {{selected}} to participate as a target ship in Operation Crossroads, a series of U.S. nuclear weapon tests held at Bikini Atoll in mid-1946. <b>In</b> <b>mid-March,</b> Nagato departed Yokosuka for Eniwetok, but her hull had not been repaired from the underwater damage sustained during the attack on 18 July and she leaked enough that her pumps could not keep up. The ship had a list of seven degrees to port by the time tugboats from Eniwetok arrived. She reached the atoll on 4 April and Bikini in May.|$|E
5|$|Strachwitz was {{promoted}} to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) of the Reserves on 1 January 1942.

From 1 December 1941 – 9 January 1942 he stayed at hospitals in Opplen and Breslau. He then went on an extended leave, staying in Groß Stein and Alt Siedel, before returning to the Eastern Front <b>in</b> <b>mid-March</b> 1942. He received the 1939 version of the Wound Badge in Silver on 17 March 1942.|$|E
5|$|The {{check on}} Forbes' {{authority}} at Perryville was Dr. Sawyer, Harding's physician {{and chairman of}} the Federal Hospitalization Board. Sawyer told Harding that Forbes was selling valuable hospital supplies to an insider contractor. At first Harding did not believe it, but Sawyer secured proof in January 1923. A shocked Harding, who alternated between rage and despondency over the corruption in his administration, summoned Forbes to the White House and demanded his resignation. Harding did not want an open scandal and allowed Forbes to flee to Europe, from where he resigned on February 15, 1923. In spite of Harding's efforts, gossip about Forbes' activities resulted in the Senate ordering an investigation two weeks later, and <b>in</b> <b>mid-March,</b> Cramer committed suicide.|$|E
50|$|In December 2011, Mitton {{was named}} {{as one of}} {{fourteen}} players {{to be on the}} 2012 Summer Olympics Australian men's national Olympic development squad. While this squad is not in the top twenty-eight and separate from the Olympic training coach, the Australian coach Ric Charlesworth did not rule out selecting from only the training squad, with players from the Olympic development having a chance at possibly being called up to represent Australia at the Olympics. He trained with the team from 18 January to <b>mid-March</b> <b>in</b> Perth, Western Australia.|$|R
50|$|The {{race was}} {{originally}} run <b>in</b> early to <b>mid-March</b> and Kentucky Derby hopefuls would then run in another major prep race in April. In 2005, Gulfstream Park shifted its scheduling {{to run the}} race five weeks before the Kentucky Derby. This was originally {{believed to be a}} liability, as the preferred spacing of races is typically three to four weeks. When Barbaro won the 2006 Kentucky Derby, the five-week spacing began to be viewed as a potentially positive feature, allowing a horse to come into the Kentucky Derby well rested.|$|R
25|$|Grizzly bears {{hibernate}} for 5–7 months {{each year}} except where {{the climate is}} warm, as the California grizzly did not hibernate. During this time, female grizzly bears give birth to their offspring, who then consume milk from their mother and gain strength {{for the remainder of}} the hibernation period. To prepare for hibernation, grizzlies must prepare a den, and consume an immense amount of food as they do not eat during hibernation. Grizzly bears do not defecate or urinate throughout the entire hibernation period. The male grizzly bear's hibernation ends <b>in</b> early to <b>mid-March,</b> while females emerge in April or early May.|$|R
