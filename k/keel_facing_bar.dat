60|$|I {{was often}} asked by our gaucho {{neighbours}} when I talked {{with them about}} birds--and they all knew that that subject interested me above all others--if I had ever heard el canto, or el cuento del Bien-te- veo. That is to say, the ballad or tale of the Bien-te-veo--a species of tyrant-bird quite common in the country, with a brown back and sulphur-yellow under parts, a crest on its head, and <b>face</b> <b>barred</b> with black and white. It is a little larger than our butcher-bird and, like it, is partly rapacious in its habits. The <b>barred</b> <b>face</b> and long kingfisher-like beak give it a peculiarly knowing or cunning look, and the effect is heightened by the long trisyllabic call constantly uttered by the bird, from which it derives its name of Bien-te-veo, which means I-can-see-you.

The different results demonstrate that the two polymers that were polluted and recycled do not show any decrease of their intrinsic properties.

Finally, it appears that the reuse of such polymers is possible...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{alignment}} of the bar in a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) experiment plays a significant role in producing a good clean signal. In this paper, numerical simulations using ANSYS-LSDYNA are employed to comprehensively study the effects of bar misalignment in producing a distorted signal. There are six major types of bar misalignment that are commonly experienced: offset of neutral axis, uneven support height, non-parallel impact <b>face,</b> <b>bar</b> straightness, dome and cone impact face shapes. The numerical simulations are divided into two main sections, i. e. bar calibration and conventional SHPB testing. The distorted signal generated by misalignment produces unreliable data analysis and is mainly due to the presence of a flexural mode of vibration. Recommendations on selecting bar specifications to minimize the deviation of results are presented...|$|R
