40|$|Abstract—Quality {{of service}} (QoS) support over {{cognitive}} radio networks (CRNs) is challenging {{due to the}} random spectrum availability. <b>Elastic</b> <b>data</b> traffic is a popular service whose service response time is an important QoS parameter. We analyze the mean response time of <b>elastic</b> <b>data</b> traffic service operating over a single channel time-slotted centralized CRN under three main service disciplines, namely, shortest processing time without preemption (SPTNP), shortest processing time with preemption, and shortest remaining processing time, {{in comparison with the}} processor sharing (PS) service discipline. It is shown that the SPTNP is a better choice over the PS service discipline when the traffic load is high, and that the preemption reduces the mean response time when the data file size (service time requirement) follows a heavy tailed distribution. The response time analysis can be used for call admission control to ensure service satisfaction.

40|$|A {{new method}} of obtaining the strange form factors of the nucleon is presented, in which forward-angle parity-violating e⃗p <b>elastic</b> {{scattering}} <b>data</b> is combined with ν p and ν̅ p <b>elastic</b> scattering <b>data.</b> The axial form factor in electron-nucleon scattering {{is complicated by the}} presence of electro-weak radiative corrections that in principle need to be calculated or separately measured, but this axial form factor is suppressed at forward angles. The neutrino data has no such complication. Hence the use of forward-angle parity-violating e⃗p data with ν p and ν̅ p data allows the extraction of all three strange form factors: electric, magnetic and axial (G_E^s, G_M^s, and G_A^s). In this letter, ν p and ν̅ p data from the Brookhaven E 734 experiment are combined with the Jefferson Lab HAPPEX e⃗p data to obtain two distinct solutions for the strange form factors at Q^ 2 = 0. 5 GeV^ 2. More generally, combining the neutrino <b>elastic</b> scattering <b>data</b> from E 734 with the existing and upcoming e⃗p data will yield the strange form factors of the nucleon for Q^ 2 of 0. 45 - 1. 05 GeV^ 2.
