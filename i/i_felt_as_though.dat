He further stated that [...] "this is from someone who was quoted early on as saying I hated them. Not that I hated them as a listener; I just don’t want to play any; I shirked guitar solos. Early on, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the songs we were making aesthetically didn't want them. This new batch of songs, to me, always want solos. I feel like every song has one." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Trapped in the Sky" [...] {{received}} a positive, contemporary critical response from L. Marsland Gander of The Daily Telegraph, who commented, [...] "It {{is a show}} {{that has to be}} seen to be disbelieved." [...] Writing for the same newspaper in 2011, Simon Heffer remembered his enthusiastic impressions of watching [...] "Trapped in the Sky" [...] as a boy in 1965, and how it endeared him {{to the rest of the}} series: [...] "... I had just watched the first episode of Thunderbirds. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the whole landscape of what passes for my imagination had been changed... It caused an excitement of the sort that is possible only for the very young, and it lasted for days. Indeed, every Saturday night was a renewal of the miracle." [...] Co-creator Sylvia Anderson observes that, by necessity, the pilot episode comprises many examples of exposition for the purposes of introducing the primary characters and vehicles. However, she considers the roles of Lady Penelope and Parker to be [...] "brief but effective".|$|E
500|$|The {{marriage}} {{was in the}} process of breaking down rapidly. Northrup and Hubbard had frequent rows and his violent behaviour towards her continued unabated. On one occasion, while Northrup was pregnant, Hubbard kicked her several times in the stomach in an apparent – though unsuccessful – attempt to induce an abortion. She recalled that [...] "with or without an argument, there'd be an upsurge of violence. The veins in his forehead would engorge" [...] and he would hit her [...] "out of the blue", breaking her eardrum in one attack. Despite this, she still [...] "felt so guilty about the fact that he was so psychologically damaged. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he had given so much to our country and I couldn't even bring him peace of mind. I believed thoroughly that he was a man of great honor, had sacrificed his well being to the country ... It just never occurred to me he was a liar." [...] He told her that he didn't want to be married [...] "for I can buy my friends whenever I want them" [...] but he could not divorce either, as the stigma would hurt his reputation. Instead, he said, if Northrup really loved him she should kill herself.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Bundercombe {{adjusted}} her spectacles severely and transferred her regard to me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> somehow <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were back {{at school and}} had been discovered in some ignominious escapade.|$|R

2500|$|Haggard {{describes}} {{feeling the}} call of God on his life after {{his first year in}} college, {{while he was in the}} kitchen at home. He had been a telecommunications major with a minor in journalism, but after this experience he believed he had been called to pastor. [...] "I was totally surprised," [...] Haggard wrote in The Life-Giving Church. [...] "I [...] [...] [...] told the Lord I wanted to serve Him. But before I mentioned this to anyone, especially to my parents, I asked the Lord to assure me by using others to confirm His calling on my life. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> He consented [...] [...] [...]" [...] Within forty-eight hours, Haggard felt that he received four unsolicited confirmations: from a Sunday school teacher, a pastor, a friend, and from his father. Haggard subsequently attended Oral Roberts University, a Christian university in Tulsa, Oklahoma, graduating in 1978.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a display}} of Parker's work ethic, work on the next Tame Impala album Lonerism had already started before Innerspeaker was even {{released}}. Lonerism was released on 5 October 2012 to widespread critical acclaim, winning many Album of the Year awards {{from the likes of}} NME Magazine, Rolling Stone Magazine and Triple J. Lonerism marks an extension of Parker's music, featuring synths and poppier melodies, and also a more lavish, lush and expansive sound. Commenting on the new-found sound, Parker said that [...] " [...] will be the kind of music that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I wanted to make during Innerspeaker, but I felt that it {{was too much of a}} jump. Back when I was doing Innerspeaker, I felt like I should make an album with only guitars, and use no synths, because I felt like it was a compromise to what we do. But I now know that it's not." [...] At the ARIA Music Awards of 2015 he won two trophies, Engineer of the Year and Producer of the Year, for his work on Tame Impala's Currents (July 2015); the group won three further categories at the ceremony: Album of the Year, Best Group and Best Rock Album.|$|E

60|$|He {{was willing}} enough to wait, perhaps, but time was inexorable. Save for one hurried interview, I {{did not see}} him again for a week, {{and then it was}} before the altar.

He fumbled with the ring. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he was my younger brother.|$|R

5000|$|In September 2010 it was {{revealed}} that Billie would be killed from alcohol poisoning, leaving Carol devastated. Although Coulson felt Anderson's departure was premature, she praised the storyline's [...] "huge shock value". Coulson felt heartbroken when she was filming Billie's death scenes, of this she stated during an interview with Inside Soap: [...] "When we had to play the scene where Carol sees Billie lying dead in the living room, it was really sad - not just because a mum had lost her son in tragic circumstances, but also because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was losing Devon too." ...|$|R

There she sat like an incarnate spirit of beauty, hardly talking at all, and when she did, very low, but all the while looking at me. There was a white flower in her black hair, and I tried to keep my eyes on it and count the petals, but it was of no use. At last, whether it was her gaze, or the perfume in her hair, or what I do not know, but <b>I</b> almost <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was being mesmerized.

The long peace won by their blood and pain is settled on the land. She had fashioned Cyril Harjohn {{for one of her}} soldiers. He would have been a martyr, in the days when thought led to the stake, a fighter for the truth, when to speak one's mind meant death. To lead some forlorn hope for Civilisation would have been his true work; Fate had condemned him to sentry duty in a well-ordered barrack.|$|R
6000|$|At the moment, I, who on {{this day}} had passed the portals of so many emotions: that of the lover's longing for his bride won at last, only to be lost again, that of acute and {{necessary}} business, that of the ancient joy of battle and vengeance wreaked upon an evil man; that of the unshuttering of my own eyes to the flame of a hellish truth, that of the self-murder and turning to cold clay before those same eyes of her whom I had hoped to clasp in honest love--I, <b>I</b> say, <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I,</b> too, were dead.

Never had she seemed fairer than as she stood thus in her white robe, a look of amaze upon her face and in her grey eyes, that was half real half feigned, and with the sunlight shifting on her auburn hair that showed beneath her little bonnet. Lily was no round-checked country maid with few beauties save those of health and youth, but a tall and shapely lady who had ripened early to her full grace and sweetness, and so it came about that though we were almost of an age, yet in her presence <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> always <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were the younger. Thus in my love for her was mingled some touch of reverence.|$|R
