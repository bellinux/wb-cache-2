50|$|For {{the first}} few years, Mapscos were not {{available}} to the general public, being intended for business and delivery purposes. Sales were slow until 1956, when the city of Dallas bought 300 copies for their fire and ambulance services. In 1955, Mapsco had adopted a Roman military style indexing system. The entire map was divided into numbered pages, and each page overlaid with a lettered grid, allowing any street to be referenced by a page number plus a <b>grid</b> <b>letter.</b> In Dallas, the grid index has not changed since then (although the number of pages has expanded greatly). At that time, the city was a bewildering array of street names that matched streets in yet unannexed areas, which lead {{to a lot of}} confusion. Mapsco was the only accurate map of the newly sprawling Sunbelt metropolis. By the late 1950s, having a Mapsco became a status symbol.|$|E

50|$|There are two players, German and British. The British {{player has}} the arduous task of placing {{the large number}} of Royal Navy vessels and search {{aircraft}} on his map-board before game play begins. Each map-board is on a <b>grid,</b> with <b>letters</b> on one axis, and numbers on the other. Each Royal Navy unit has a historically accurate starting point. The German setup takes but a moment, since the Germans have only a few bomber units and the task force with Bismarck and Prinz Eugen to place on their map.|$|R
50|$|Most American {{published}} sources do {{not indicate}} an origin for the UTM system. The NOAA website states {{the system to}} have been developed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and published material that does state an origin apparently based on that account. However, a series of aerial photos found in the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv (the military section of the German Federal Archives) apparently dating from 1943-1944 bear the inscription UTMREF followed by <b>grid</b> <b>letters</b> and digits, and projected according to the transverse Mercator, a finding that would indicate that something called the UTM Reference system {{was developed in the}} 1942-43 time frame by the Wehrmacht. It was probably carried out by the Abteilung für Luftbildwesen (Department for Aerial Photography). From 1947 onward the US Army employed a very similar system, but with the now-standard 0.9996 scale factor at the central meridian as opposed to the German 1.0. For areas within the contiguous United States the Clarke Ellipsoid of 1866 was used. For the remaining areas of Earth, including Hawaii, the International Ellipsoid was used. The WGS84 ellipsoid is now generally used to model the Earth in the UTM coordinate system, which means current UTM northing at a given point can differ up to 200 meters from the old. For different geographic regions, other datum systems (e.g.: ED50, NAD83) can be used.|$|R

5|$|People of {{all ages}} played board games pitting two players against each other, {{including}} latrunculi ("Raiders"), a game of strategy in which opponents coordinated the movements and capture of multiple game pieces, and XII scripta ("Twelve Marks"), involving dice and arranging pieces on a <b>grid</b> of <b>letters</b> or words. A game referred to as alea (dice) or tabula (the board), to which the emperor Claudius was notoriously addicted, may have been similar to backgammon, using a dice-cup (pyrgus).

The maps usually show grid lines and ticks, their values, <b>grid</b> <b>letters,</b> and notes in the margin identifying the grid and the grid zone designation. Variations in the specifications for particular types of products at 1 : 1, 000, 000 scale exist. The individual product specifications must be followed.

50|$|Text {{is another}} {{important}} element of her work; she would cut up and rearrange the faded, naive lettering found on these items to create abstract yet evocative <b>grids</b> of <b>letters</b> and word fragments, sometimes alluding to the crosswords and poetry of which she was so fond.

She also had a fondness for the pronouncements of Pablo Picasso.

50|$|The {{complete}} {{grid reference}} includes both the <b>grid</b> square <b>letters</b> and the numerical reference giving the location within the grid square. For instance, wQ 683 825 is a location in South London. Grid references {{can also be}} given in an all numeral notation. To do this, square vV (the South-West corner of the grid out in the Atlantic) is taken as square zero and then the grid squares are counted {{from there to the}} location being referenced. For instance qY 985 613 (somewhere around Carlisle) can also be expressed as 3985 5613. This is because square qY is three 100 km squares East of square vV and five 100 km squares North of vV. However, it is frequently not necessary to explicitly give the grid square at all, this can be implied from context.|$|R
