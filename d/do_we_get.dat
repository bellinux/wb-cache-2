[...] Parker also described the ending of the episode as [...] "a bloodbath, (which) is what a good zombie movie should be". [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first South Park episode Parker and Stone felt unsatisfied with once production was complete. Parker said, [...] "We were pretty bummed out, and we kind of thought, well, we're going to have a bad episode go on the air, and hopefully it won't alienate too many people, and we'll try to get our viewers back for Thanksgiving.

500|$|However, Trio members never {{claimed to}} be folksingers and were never {{comfortable}} with the label. The liner notes for the group's first album featured a quotation from Dave Guard asserting that [...] "We are not folksingers in the accepted sense of the word." [...] Guard later told journalist Richard Hadlock in Down Beat magazine: [...] "We are not students of folk music; the basic thing for us is honest and worthwhile songs that people can pick up and become involved in." [...] Nick Reynolds added in the same article: [...] "We don't collect old songs {{in the sense that}} the academic cats <b>do...</b> <b>We</b> <b>get</b> new tunes to look over every day. Each one of us has his ears open constantly to new material or old stuff that's good." [...] Bob Shane remarked years later: [...] "To call the Kingston Trio folksingers was kind of stupid in the first place. We never called ourselves folksingers... We did folk-oriented material, but we did it amid all kinds of other stuff. But they didn't know what to call us with our instruments, so Capitol Records called us folksingers and gave us credit for starting this whole boom." ...|$|E

[...] and called 1Nenokkadine a [...] "visually stunning" [...] film. Sridhar Vivan of Bangalore Mirror gave the film 3.5out of five stars: [...] "As the film tries out a refined or reformed revenge saga, {{it needs to be}} seen whether 1 Nenokkadine works at the box office. If it does, it is a good sign for Telugu cinema". A. S. Sashidhar of The Times of India wrote, [...] "The first half of 1: Nenokkadine is good and will keep you wanting for more. The story has a few interesting twists and turns, in the second half too to keep the audience glued to the screen", and Sukumar [...] "should be commended for superb attempt in choosing to make a film that has not been explored in Telugu movies". Shekhar of Oneindia called the film a [...] "brilliant psychological thriller": [...] "The first half of 1: Nenokkadine is excellent and will impress all classes of audience. A few sentimental scenes slow down the pace of narration in the second half. But the superb climax that lasts for 15 minutes will compensate it.

500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E

2500|$|Filming {{the scene}} in which DS Miller confronts her murderous husband {{required}} some special care. The scene had been suggested by Olivia Colman.

[...] Although no such scene had been written, they assured her it would be included (assuming Ellie Miller was not the murderer). Actors Olivia Colman and Matthew Gravelle were kept apart before the scene was filmed {{as a means of}} heightening the tension between the two during their meeting. The scene called for Colman to attack Gravelle, who would fall to the ground and allow Colman to kick him in the back. Gravelle's back was fitted with safety padding, but Colman's performance was so intense that she kicked him too hard and Gravelle was bruised for three weeks.|$|E
