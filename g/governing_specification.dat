40|$|AbstractFormation of the {{adenohypophysis}} in mammalian embryos occurs via an invagination of {{the oral}} ectoderm to form Rathke’s pouch, which becomes exposed to opposing dorsoventral gradients of signaling proteins <b>governing</b> <b>specification</b> of the different hormone-producing pituitary cell types. One signal promoting pituitary cell proliferation and differentiation to ventral cell types is Sonic hedgehog (Shh) from the oral ectoderm. To study pituitary formation and patterning in zebrafish, we cloned four cDNAs encoding different pituitary hormones, prolactin (prl), proopiomelancortin (pomc), thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh), and growth hormone (gh), and analyzed their expression patterns relative {{to that of the}} pituitary marker lim 3. prl and pomc start to be expressed at the lateral edges of the lim 3 expression domain, before pituitary cells move into the head. This indicates that patterning of the pituitary anlage and terminal differentiation of pituitary cells starts while cells are still organized in a placodal fashion at the anterior edge of the developing brain. Following the expression pattern of prl and pomc during development, we show that no pituitary-specific invagination equivalent to Rathke’s pouch formation takes place. Rather, pituitary cells move inwards together with stomodeal cells during oral cavity formation, with medial cells of the placode ending up posterior and lateral cells ending up anterior, resulting in an anterior-posterior, rather than a dorsoventral, patterning of the adenohypophysis. Carrying out loss- and gain-of-function experiments, we show that Shh from the ventral diencephalon plays a crucial role during induction, patterning, and growth of the zebrafish adenohypophysis. The phenotypes are very similar to those obtained upon pituitary-specific inactivation or overexpression of Shh in mouse embryo, suggesting that the role of Shh during pituitary development has been largely conserved between fish and mice, despite the different modes of pituitary formation in the two vertebrate classes...|$|E

40|$|SummarySonic {{hedgehog}} (SHH) is a regulator of forebrain {{development that}} acts through its receptor, patched  1. However, {{little is known}} about cellular mechanisms at neurulation, whereby SHH from the prechordal plate <b>governs</b> <b>specification</b> of the rostral diencephalon ventral midline (RDVM), a major forebrain organizer. We identified LRP 2, a member of the LDL receptor gene family, as a component of the SHH signaling machinery in the RDVM. LRP 2 acts as an apical SHH-binding protein that sequesters SHH in its target field and controls internalization and cellular trafficking of SHH/patched 1 complexes. Lack of LRP 2 in mice and in cephalic explants results in failure to respond to SHH, despite functional expression of patched 1 and smoothened, whereas overexpression of LRP 2 variants in cells increases SHH signaling capacity. Our data identify a critical role for LRP 2 in SHH signaling and reveal the molecular mechanism underlying forebrain anomalies in mice and patients with Lrp 2 defects...|$|R

40|$|Neocortical {{projection}} neurons {{arise from}} a pseudostratified ven-tricular epithelium (PVE) from embryonic day 11 (E 11) to E 17 in mice. The sequence of neuron origin is systematically related to mechan-isms that specify neuronal class properties including laminar fate destination. Thus, the neurons to be assembled into the deeper layers are the earliest generated, while those to be assembled into super-ficial layers are the later generated neurons. The sequence of neuron origin also correlateswith {{the probability of}} cell cycle exit (Q) and the duration of G 1 -phase of the cell cycle (TG 1) in the PVE. Both Q and TG 1 increase as neuronogenesis proceeds. We test the hypothesis that mechanisms regulating specification of neuronal laminar destination, Q and TG 1 are coordinately regulated. We find that overexpression of p 27 Kip 1 in the PVE from E 12 to E 14 increases Q but not TG 1 and that the increased Q {{is associated with a}} commensurate increase in the proportion of exiting cells that is directed to superficial layers. We conclude that mechanisms that <b>govern</b> <b>specification</b> of neocortical neuronal laminar destination are coordinately regulated with mech-anisms that regulate Q and are independent of mechanisms regulatory to cell cycle duration.

40|$|Background: Mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons (mDA) and serotonergic (5 -HT) neurons are {{clinically}} important ventral neuronal populations. Degeneration of mDA {{is associated}} with Parkinson’s disease; defects in the serotonergic system are related to depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. Although these neuronal subpopulations reveal positional and developmental relationships, the developmental cascades that <b>govern</b> <b>specification</b> and differentiation of mDA or 5 -HT neurons reveal missing determinants and are not yet understood. Methodology: We investigated {{the impact of the}} transcription factor Sim 1 in the differentiation of mDA and rostral 5 -HT neurons in vivo using Sim 1 -/- mouse embryos and newborn pups, and in vitro by gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Principal Findings: We show a selective significant {{reduction in the number of}} dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5 -HT neurons in Sim 1 -/- newborn mice. In contrast, 5 -HT neurons of other raphe nuclei as well as dopaminergic neurons were not affected. Analysis of the underlying molecular mechanism revealed that tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph 2) and the transcription factor Pet 1 are regulated by Sim 1. Moreover, the transcription factor Lhx 8 and the modulator of 5 -HT 1 A-mediated neurotransmitter release, Rgs 4, exhibit significant higher expression in ventral hindbrain, compared to midbrain and are target genes of Sim 1. Conclusions: The results demonstrate for the first time a selective transcription factor dependence of the 5 -HT cell groups, and introduce Sim 1 as a regulator of DRN specification acting upstream of Pet 1 and Tph 2.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} that <b>govern</b> <b>specification</b> of various cell types that constitute vertebrate heart {{are not fully}} understood. Whilst most studies of heart development have utilised the mouse embryo, we have used an alternative model, embryos of the frog Xenopus laevis, which permits direct experimental manipulation of a non-essential heart. We show that in this model pluripotent animal cap explants injected with cardiogenic factor GATA 4 mRNA express pan-myocardial as well as ventricular and proepicardial markers. We found that cardiac cell fate diversification, as assessed by ventricular and proepicardial markers, critically depends on tissue integrity, as it is disrupted by dissociation but can be fully restored by inhibition of the BMP pathway and partially by Dkk- 1. Ventricular and proepicardial cell fates can also be restored in reaggregated GATA 4 -expressing cells upon transplantation into a host embryo. The competence of the host embryo to induce ventricular and proepicardial markers gradually decreases with {{the age of the}} transplant and is lost by the onset of myocardial differentiation at the late tailbud stage (st. 28). The influence of the host on the transplant was not limited to diversification of cardiac cell fates, but also included induction of growth and rhythmic beating, resulting in generation of a secondary heart-like structure. Our results additionally show that efficient generation of secondary heart requires normal axial patterning of the host embryo. Furthermore, secondary hearts can be induced {{in a wide range of}} locations within the host, arguing that the host embryo provides a permissive environment for development of cardiac patterning, growth and physiological maturation. Our results have implications for a major goal of cardiac regenerative medicine, differentiation of ventricular myocardium...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The highly ordered {{vertebrate}} retina {{is composed}} of seven cell types derived from a common pool of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), and is a good model for the studies of cell differentiation and interaction during neural development. Notch signaling plays {{a pivotal role in}} retinogenesis in mammals, but the full scope of the functions of Notch pathway, and the underlying molecular mechanisms, remain unclear. Results In this study, we conditionally knocked out RBP-J, the critical transcription factor downstream to all four Notch receptors, in RPCs of mouse retina at different developmental stages. Disruption of RBP-J at early retinogenesis resulted in accelerated RPCs differentiation, but only photoreceptors and ganglion cells were overrepresented, with other neuronal populations diminished. Similarly, deletion of RBP-J at early postnatal days also led to overproduction of photoreceptors, suggesting that RBP-J <b>governed</b> RPCs <b>specification</b> and differentiation through retinogenesis. In all the RBP-J deletion models, the retinal laminar structures were distorted by the formation of numerous rosette-like structures, reminiscent of β-catenin deficient retina. Indeed, we found that these rosettes aligned with gaps in β-catenin expression at the apical surface of the retina. By in vivo electroporation-mediated transfection, we demonstrated that lamination defects in RBP-J deficient retinae were rescued by overexpressing β-catenin. Conclusions Our data indicate that RBP-J-mediated canonical Notch signaling <b>governs</b> retinal cell <b>specification</b> and differentiation, and maintains retinal lamination through the expression of β-catenin. </p...|$|R

40|$|Myogenic {{determination}} {{factors are}} basic helix–loop–helix proteins that <b>govern</b> <b>specification</b> and differentiation of muscle cells, and bind to the E-box consensus sequence CANNTG in promoter regions of muscle-specific genes. No E-box mutation {{has been reported}} to date. RAPSN encodes rapsyn, a 43 kDa postsynaptic peripheral membrane protein that clusters the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the motor endplate. Transcriptional regulation mechanisms of RAPSN have not been studied. We here report two novel E-box mutations in the RAPSN promoter region in eight congenital myasthenic syndrome patients. Patient 1 carries- 27 C!G that changes an E-box at 27 to 22 from CAGCTG to GAGCTG. An allele harboring- 27 C!G is not transcribed in patient’s muscle. Patients 2 – 8 are of Oriental Jewish stock of Iraqi or Iranian origin with facial malformations, and harbor- 38 A!G that changes another E-box at 40 to 35 from CAACTG to CAGCTG, which does not affect the consensus CANNTG sequence. Haplotype analysis shows that- 38 A!G arises from a common founder. For each mutation, position þ 1 represents the major transcriptional start site that we determine to be 172 nucleotides upstream of the translational start site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays reveal that- 38 A!G gains, and- 27 C!G looses, binding affinity for different components of nuclear extracts of C 2 C 12 myotubes. Luciferase reporter assays show that both- 38 A!G and- 27 C!G attenuate reporter gene expression in C 2 C 12 myotubes, and that- 27 C!G additionally attenuates reporter gene expression in MyoD- or myogenin-transfected HEK cells.
