25|$|We {{look for}} a solid and impregnable barrier of the Democracies against the three Axis powers, and we refuse to accept the dictum that the Pacific {{struggle}} must {{be treated as a}} subordinate segment of the general conflict. By that it is not meant that any one of the other theatres of war is of less importance than the Pacific, but that Australia asks for a concerted plan evoking the greatest strength at the Democracies' disposal, determined upon hurling Japan back. The Australian Government, therefore regards the Pacific struggle as primarily one in which the United States and Australia must have the fullest say {{in the direction of the}} Democracies' fighting plan. Without any inhibitions of any kind, <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom. We know the problems that the United Kingdom faces. We know the dangers of dispersal of strength, but we know too, that Australia can go and Britain can still hold on. We are, therefore, determined that Australia shall not go, and we shall exert all our energies towards the shaping of a plan, with the United States as its keystone, which will give to our country some confidence of being able to hold out until the tide of battle swings against the enemy.|$|E

500|$|Introspection {{was also}} listed {{as one of}} the {{foundational}} themes prevalent on the album, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection scattered among the posturing of 'Bitch I'm Madonna' and 'Unapologetic Bitch'" [...] according to Slant Magazines Sam C. Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet for me to think about that. It just seemed like a time where I wanted to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. How did <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> and they didn't?" [...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was almost like an acting exercise, you know, just putting myself in a room and letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E

Tony Iommi is the king of the heavy riff." [...] former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash said of the Paranoid album: [...] "There's just something about that whole record that, when you're a kid and you're turned onto it, it's like a whole different world. It just opens up your mind to another dimension...Paranoid is the whole Sabbath experience; very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time. Tony's playing style—doesn't matter whether it's off Paranoid or if it's off Heaven and Hell—it's very distinctive."

500|$|I, the Supreme (orig. Spanish Yo el supremo) is a {{historical}} novel written by exiled Paraguayan author Augusto Roa Bastos. It is a fictionalized account of the nineteenth-century Paraguayan dictator José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, who was also known as [...] "Dr. Francia." [...] The book's title derives {{from the fact that}} Francia referred to himself as [...] "El Supremo" [...] or [...] "the Supreme." [...] The first {{in a long line of}} dictators, the Supreme was a severe, calculating despot. [...] The central themes of the novel are power and language and the relation between the two. [...] The Supreme believes himself to be above all power and history: [...] "I don't write history. <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>it.</b> I can remake it as I please, adjusting, stressing, enriching its meaning and truth." [...] Yet this assertion is constantly challenged by the very fact that while he achieves power by means of writing and dictating, these very same methods can be used by others to dispute his authority. Not even his own identity, represented by the personal pronoun I, is safe and can easily be usurped as is demonstrated by the incident of the pasquinade. Language, as powerful as it is, can never be controlled and can just as easily be used as an instrument of coercion as an instrument of resistance.|$|E
500|$|The album's Roman numeral title {{referred}} {{to each of}} the band members having turned 20 years old by the time xx was released. Because of their age, many critics interpreted the songs as nocturnal depictions of adolescent lust. Philip Sherburne wrote in Spin that xx brimmed with a [...] "young lust" [...] often found in rock music, and recordings such as [...] "Fantasy" [...] and [...] "Shelter" [...] expressed a jaded yearning, particularly in a lyric from the latter song: [...] "Can <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> better with the lights turned on". Croft vehemently denied this: [...] "We were writing these songs when we were 17. I can honestly say I've never thought this is about my sex life." [...] Croft and Sim, who were both gay, did not intend for the songs to be heard as romantic duets; she said they were singing [...] "past each other" [...] rather than to each other. Having combined their individually written lyrics, they could not definitely explain what their songs were about, although Croft said Sim's lyrics resonated with her nonetheless and enjoyed the personal interpretation it offered. [...] "You can put them into your own life", she explained, [...] "like, 'Oh, this is my song. The romantic situations Sim wrote of had been inspired by other people. [...] "I hadn't really had any relationships to be working off, but I had a huge interest in life, and looking at other people's relationships around me", he said.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} an inspirational message of inner strength, and finds Carey {{reaching out to}} listeners. The song uses a rainstorm {{as a metaphor for}} troubles in life, while encouraging others to [...] "make it through the rain" [...] through perseverance. The first chorus begins: [...] "When you get caught in the rain / With no where to run / When your distraught and in pain without anyone / When you keep crying out to be saved", illustrating a moment in an individual's life where they are surrounded by conflict. The chorus then serves as a guide to those still suffering, [...] "I can make it through the rain, I can stand up once again on my own / And I know that I'm strong enough to mend / And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith / And I live one more day and <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> through the rain". Similarly, the second verse once again revisits difficult times when [...] "shadows grow close", before continuing into the second chorus and climax. While the song in meant for listeners to gain confidence and strength, it also allows them into Carey's personal struggles she endured throughout 2001. Lola Ogunnaike of The New York Times described the song as a [...] "triumph over adversity", while a writer from the Sydney Morning Herald wrote [...] "it's an insight into her recent troubles." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Carey described the song's lyrical content in depth: ...|$|E
500|$|The novel's format, {{its various}} {{multiple}} sources, its manipulation of linear time and its inclusion of supernatural elements (talking dogs and meteor rifles, for example) all serve to deconstruct {{the idea of}} absolute power, by creating an ambiguity between fact and myth, between Dr Francia and the Supreme, and between Roa Bastos and the Compiler. Francia places himself above all power and history: [...] "I don't write history. <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>it.</b> I can remake it as I please, adjusting, stressing, enriching its meaning and truth." [...] Yet in the Compiler's notes and retelling of events, the novel {{is presented as a}} genuine version of history, one that contradicts and questions the Supreme's. In their collectivity, they deny the illusion of absolute power, whether the power is that of Francia the dictator or Roa Bastos the writer. This ambiguity between myth and fact is elaborated on {{at the end of the}} novel in the fictional debate over the Supreme's remains; it questions the nature of national political myth, and how heroes and villains are created in it and where the Supreme falls into those categories after being portrayed as both by Roa Bastos. As Deiner poses the question raised by the novel, [...] "Is he to be portrayed as a valiant leader who held the country together in the face of enormous external aggression, or as a despot who laid the basis for almost two centuries of exploitation of Paraguay’s peoples by its leaders?" [...] The answer is not so much of importance to the novel, so much as the fact that the question itself exists, thereby confirming the power of writing over so called [...] "absolute" [...] power.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Party" [...] {{features}} Beyoncé as {{the female}} protagonist [...] "in {{the mood for}} some loving" [...] as she references to a get-together for two persons. West rhymes about [...] "swag sauce" [...] and [...] "swagu" [...] in the introductory lines, [...] "You a bad girl, your friends bad too / You got the swag sauce, you're drippin' Swagu", before passing the torch to Beyoncé, who begins to sing the first verse slowly and steadily, [...] "I may be young but I'm ready / To give you all my love / I told my girls {{you can get it}} / Don't slow it down, just let it go / So in love / I'll give it all away / Just don't tell nobody tomorrow". In the chorus lines, she harmonizes over the sample from [...] "La Di Da Di", [...] "Cause tonight's the night that I give you everything / Music knocking until the morning light / 'Cause we like to party". In the second verse, Beyoncé belts out [...] "in a thick stack of smooth, layered vocals". After chanting the chorus for a second time, André 3000 surfaces around the 2:15 mark with [...] "some very naughty references" [...] to milk on the verses he raps, [...] "... another homeboy, that nigga named Cheese / Fuck wit' me baby, <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> milk 'til it drip down yo' knees", before switching gears altogether and getting philosophical about his own career, [...] "Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old / Never thought that we could become someone else's hero / Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros", and finally adopting a [...] "multi-syllabic tongue twister" [...] to rap some of the finishing lines. The song runs out with Beyoncé reiterating the lines, [...] "Cause we like to party, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey", and West then [...] reprises the opening lines.|$|E

2500|$|On 7 December 1941 the US Navy Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbour was {{attacked}} by the Japanese. A US convoy bound for the Philippines was redirected to Brisbane, arriving on 22 December 1941. Shortly after the entry of Japan into the War, Australian foreign policy appeared to make its most dramatic shift since Federation. On 27 December 1941 Prime Minister John Curtin stated [...] "Without any inhibitions of any kind <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> quite clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links of kinship with the United Kingdom ... we shall exert all our energies toward the shaping of a plan, with the United States as its cornerstone." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{equivalent}} in cricket {{is almost impossible}} because the bowler is next to the runner, and in fact {{used to be able}} to mankad him if he strayed out of his crease; nowadays the batsman can leave the crease when the bowler's back foot touches the ground during his delivery action without risk of being 'mankaded' (but there have been cases of a non-striker having been run out backing up when a bowler's misfield has hit the stumps). Tactical running in cricket rarely strays beyond the consideration of [...] "can <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to the other end before the ball does". One exception of this is towards the end of a closely fought limited overs game, where a batsman (normally a tail-ender) would sacrifice his wicket to allow the better batsman to remain on strike, usually in the last few balls.
