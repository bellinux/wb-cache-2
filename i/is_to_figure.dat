25|$|In general, fMRI studies acquire both many {{functional}} {{images with}} fMRI and a structural image with MRI. The structural image is usually {{of a higher}} resolution and depends on a different signal, the T1 magnetic field decay after excitation. To demarcate regions {{of interest in the}} functional image, one needs to align it with the structural one. Even when whole-brain analysis is done, to interpret the final results, that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out which regions the active voxels fall in, one has to align the functional image to the structural one. This is done with a coregistration algorithm that works similar to the motion-correction one, except that here the resolutions are different, and the intensity values cannot be directly compared since the generating signal is different.|$|E

500|$|In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison {{credits the}} {{influence}} for his song [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] to A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder {{and leader of}} the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement. Harrison adds that the song specifically espouses the message that [...] "we are not these bodies, we are in these material bodies in the physical world." [...] His friend Ravi Shankar once observed that Harrison exhibited tyagi, a trait meaning non-attachment or renunciation, a point to which Shankar added: [...] "He had everything – all the wealth, the fame, whatever he wanted. But he was not attached to it... because he was searching for something much higher, much deeper. It does seem like he already had some Indian background in him [...]" [...] Harrison later said of life in the material world, referring to the need to break the cycle of rebirth associated with reincarnation: [...] "The whole point to being here, really, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> a way to get out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{has also}} greatly {{expanded}} the State Department's use of social media, including Facebook and Twitter, both {{to get its}} message out and to help empower people vis à via their rulers. Clinton said, [...] "We are {{in the age of}} participation, and the challenge ... <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out how to be responsive, to help catalyze, unleash, channel the kind of participatory eagerness that is there." [...] She has tried to institutionalize this change, by making social media a focus for foreign service officers and up to the ambassadorial level. (Other Clinton initiatives were run solely out of her office and were at risk of disappearing after she left office.) By late 2011, the department had 288 Facebook accounts and 192 Twitter feeds. The change was enough for daughter Chelsea Clinton to refer to the secretary as [...] "TechnoMom".|$|E
6000|$|... "Without loss, you mean, of--a--my daughter's time?" [...] Lord Theign, confessedly and amiably interested, had {{accepted}} these intimations--yet {{with the very}} blandness that was not accessible to hustling and was never forgetful of its standing privilege of criticism. He had come in from his public duty, a few minutes before, somewhat flushed and blown; but that had presently dropped--to the effect, we should have guessed, of his appearing to Lord John at least as cool as the occasion required. His appearance, we ourselves certainly should have felt, was in all respects charming--with the great note of it the beautiful restless, almost suspicious, challenge to you, {{on the part of}} deep and mixed things in him, his pride and his shyness, his conscience, his taste and his temper, to deny that he was admirably simple. Obviously, at this rate, he had a passion for simplicity--simplicity, above all, of relation with you, and would show you, with the last subtlety of displeasure, his impatience of your attempting anything more with himself. With such an ideal of decent ease he would, confound you, [...] "sink" [...] a hundred other attributes--or the recognition at least and the formulation of them--that you might abjectly have taken for granted in him: just to show you that in a beastly vulgar age you had, and small wonder, a beastly vulgar imagination. He sank thus, surely, in defiance of insistent vulgarity, half his consciousness of his advantages, flattering himself that mere facility and amiability, a true effective, a positively ideal suppression of reference in any one to anything that might complicate, alone floated above. This would be quite his religion, you might infer--to cause his hands to ignore in whatever contact any opportunity, however convenient, for an unfair pull. Which habit it was that must have produced in him a sort of ripe and radiant fairness; if it be allowed us, that <b>is,</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> in so shining an air a nobleman of fifty-three, of an undecided rather than a certified frame or outline, of a head thinly though neatly covered and not measureably massive, of an almost trivial freshness, of a face marked but by a fine inwrought line or two and lighted by a merely charming expression. You might somehow have traced back the whole character so presented to an ideal privately invoked--that of his establishing in the formal garden of his suffered greatness such easy seats and short perspectives, such winding paths and natural-looking waters, as would mercifully break up the scale. You would perhaps indeed have reflected {{at the same time that}} the thought of so much mercy was almost more than anything else the thought of a great option and a great margin--in fine of fifty alternatives. Which remarks of ours, however, leave his lordship with his last immediate question on his hands.|$|E
