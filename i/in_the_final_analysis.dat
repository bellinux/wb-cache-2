500|$|Eurogamer {{praised the}} game's graphics, camera angles and mini-games, but complained about unfair enemies, {{annoying}} character accents and an arbitrary mix of musical genres. The reviewer believed that [...] " [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>analysis</b> {{is just not}} good enough to warrant spending £40." [...] IGN gave it a [...] "passable" [...] verdict: the reviewer felt that the game's brief initial appeal quickly gave way to repetition. He had a mixed opinion of its graphics, with praise given to the character animations, but criticism to perceived poor draw distance. GameSpot deemed the game [...] "mediocre". The reviewer noted that [...] "the humor almost always falls flat", and that [...] "ToeJam's speech [...] is filled with stupid double entendres". The website found the soundtrack to be dated, and called the game's audio [...] "a serious disappointment".|$|E
500|$|Allied {{commander}}s, {{and later}} historians, debated whether the Admiralty Islands Campaign was the bold action {{of a great}} commander or a reckless endeavour that courted disaster. Admiral Fechteler felt, [...] "we're damn lucky we didn't get run off the island," [...] and Admiral Barbey, for one, believed the original plan {{would have resulted in}} overrunning the islands in short order with fewer casualties. It would certainly have been much less risky, but it is doubtful whether an assault on the well-defended beaches of Seeadler Harbour would have resulted in fewer casualties. Whereas, in accelerating both MacArthur and Nimitz's campaigns, it shortened the war by at least a month. Thus, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>analysis,</b> the campaign [...] "had the great virtue of hastening victory while reducing the number of dead and wounded".|$|E

500|$|The film {{score was}} {{composed}} by Leonard Rosenman. Bakshi wanted to include music by Led Zeppelin but producer Saul Zaentz insisted upon an orchestral score {{because he would}} not be able to release the band's music on his Fantasy Records label. Bakshi later stated that he hated Rosenman's score, which he found to be too cliché. In Lord of the Rings: Popular Culture in Global Context, Ernest Mathijs writes that Rosenman's score [...] "is a middle ground between his more sonorous but dissonant earlier scores and his more traditional (and less challenging) sounding music [...] <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>analysis,</b> Rosenman's score has little that marks it out as distinctively about Middle Earth, relying on traditions of music (including film music) more than any specific attempt to paint a musical picture of the different lands and peoples of Tolkien's imagination." [...] The film's score was issued as a double-LP soundtrack album in 1978. A limited collector edition was created by Fantasy Records as a picture disc double LP featuring four scenes: The Hobbits leaving Hobbiton, The Ringwraiths at Bree, Gandalf and the Balrog, Journey with the Orcs. In 2001, the album was reissued on compact disc, with bonus tracks.|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} these ships was very {{controversial}} {{while they were}} being built in the 1870s, with many articles being published in the newspapers of the day by supporters and detractors, and later picked up by historians. One such account, published in 1875, claimed that Novgorod made an uncontrollable turn while on the Dniepr, while Reed, describing {{a time when the}} ship's engines on one side were reversed during a cruise in Sevastopol Bay, wrote: [...] "The circular form is so extremely favourable to this kind of handiness that the Novgorod can easily be revolved on her centre at a speed which quickly makes one giddy. She can, nevertheless, be promptly brought to rest, and, if, needed have her rotary motion reversed." [...] It would seem probable that the two reports quoted above were combined into the story as given by Fred T. Jane: [...] "On a trial cruise, they (Novgorod and [...] ) went up the Dniepr very nicely for some distance, till they turned to retire. Then the current caught them, and they were carried out to sea, whirled helplessly round and round, every soul on board helplessly incapacitated by vertigo." [...] The other criticisms made by Preston have been discussed earlier and the opinion of naval historian Stephen McLaughlin is a reasonable assessment of these ships: <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>analysis,</b> the popovkas seem to have been relatively effective coast-defence vessels; certainly their combination of armament and armour could have only been carried by a conventional ship of much greater draught. Their faults – and they certainly had faults — were exaggerated by critics, both in Russia and abroad, and have left as a legacy stories of uncontrollable ships designed by incompetent men.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his later}} philosophy, Russell subscribed {{to a kind}} of neutral monism, {{maintaining}} that the distinctions between the material and mental worlds, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>analysis,</b> were arbitrary, and that both can be reduced to a neutral property—a view similar to one held by the American philosopher/psychologist, William James, and one that was first formulated by Baruch Spinoza, whom Russell greatly admired. Instead of James' [...] "pure experience," [...] however, Russell characterised the stuff of our initial states of perception as [...] "events," [...] a stance which is curiously akin to his old teacher Whitehead's process philosophy.|$|E

2500|$|Thus {{the innate}} {{language}} that expresses the total reciprocal self-giving of {{husband and wife}} is overlaid, through contraception, by an objectively contradictory language, namely, that of not giving oneself totally to the other.

2500|$|Heidegger's silence {{about the}} stark {{similarities}} between {{his account of}} temporality and Husserl's investigation of internal time-consciousness contributes to a misrepresentation of Husserl's account of intentionality. Contrary to the criticisms Heidegger advances in his lectures, intentionality (and, by implication, the meaning of 'to be') <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>analysis</b> is not construed by Husserl as sheer presence (be it {{the presence of a}} fact or object, act or event). Yet for all its [...] "dangerous closeness" [...] to what Heidegger understands by temporality, Husserl's account of internal time-consciousness does differ fundamentally. In Husserl's account the structure of protentions is accorded neither the finitude nor the primacy that Heidegger claims are central to the original future of ecstatic-horizonal temporality.|$|E
