40|$|Competition in {{telecommunications}} {{is being}} promoted {{throughout the world}} with extensive liberalisation occurring in many countries. Past monopoly provision means that the new era of competition features large incumbent operators. The traditional lack of rivalry means that to accommodate competition liberalisation entails the entry of new operators. These conditions could prompt incumbents to abuse their dominant position when confronted with new entry. Foreclos-ure problems in telecommunications are potentially very acute because successful entry {{is dependent on the}} incumbent offering interconnection. The services provided through interconnection, such as call origination and call termination, and the charges levied for these services, access prices, {{lie at the heart of}} pro-competitive measures. The access prices set by incumbents will require scrutiny In practice regulatory authorities face difficulties in evaluating access prices that balance the competing claims of the incumbent and entrants, and ensure that reasonable prices are established which are compatible with the promotion of <b>efficient</b> <b>competition.</b> In this article I outline some theoretical contributions on access pricing which have helped regulators to design regulatory regimes to promote <b>efficient</b> <b>competition...</b>|$|E

40|$|Hospital {{markets are}} often characterised by price {{regulation}} {{and the existence}} of different ownership types. Using a Hotelling framework, this paper analyses the effect of heterogeneous objectives of the hospitals on quality differentiation, profits, and overall welfare in a price regulated duopoly with exogenous symmetric locations. In contrast to other studies on mixed duopolies, this paper shows that in this framework privatisation of the public hospital may increase overall welfare. This holds if the public hospital is similar to the private hospital or less <b>efficient</b> and <b>competition</b> is low. The main driving force is the single regulated price which induces under-(over-) provision of quality of the more (less) efficient hospital compared to the first-best. However, if the public hospital is sufficiently more <b>efficient</b> and <b>competition</b> is fierce, a mixed duopoly outperforms both a private and a public duopoly due to an equilibrium price below (above) the price of the private (public) duopoly. This medium price discourages overprovision of quality of the less efficient hospital and - together with the non-profit objective - encourages an increase in quality of the more efficient public hospital.

In an efficient allocation the date of invention coincides with the date of innovation (the date at which technology is used). This is also true with a pure monopoly, but monopoly retards technical progress relative to the <b>efficient</b> level. <b>Competition</b> for patents rights to a new technology results in excessively rapid technical progress if the resource endowment {{of the economy is}} sufficiently large.

Photozoan assemblages typically develop under tropical and oligotrophic conditions, while hetorozoan assemblages tend to thrive in high-nutrient settings. The Pietra di Finale Formation shows, however, that high weathering and an increase of nutrient inputs related to Alpine uplift and humid climatic conditions promoted Halimeda over the seagrass carbonate factory in the photic zone. The successful Halimeda proliferation was due to its <b>efficient</b> <b>competition</b> for nutrients, especially nitrogen. Thus, the Pietra di Finale Formation represents an interesting, counter-intuitive example in which increased nutrient concentrations promoted, instead of inhibited, a photozoan over a seagrass-related heterozoan carbonate production...|$|E
40|$|With the {{progressive}} introduction of competition into the traditional public utility industries, it becomes necessary for regulators to ensure access of competitors to the bottleneck facilities {{controlled by the}} incumbent monopolists on terms consistent with <b>efficient</b> <b>competition.</b> Efficient component pricing correctly solves that problem: under its rules, competition is enabled to achieve first-order, technical efficiency. The rule {{is also consistent with}} allowing competition to promote dynamic efficiency, although achieving this goal also requires reforming traditional cost-plus regulation. The Baumol and Sidak rule does not in itself, however, permit competition to fulfill its other functions of eroding monopoly profits and promoting allocative efficiency. It can therefore be permitted only when the charges for the essential inputs are regulated, so as to ensure that any markups above marginal costs in those charges are no greater than is necessary to afford the challenged utility companies a fair opportunity to earn a return on their invested capita...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{calibrate}} the social cost of optimal taxes {{in a class}} of imperfectly competitive economies and examine the correspondence of this social cost with the number of tax instruments and the number and the sources of distortions. We calibrate the Ramsey equilibrium for three standard models of imperfect competition. These settings are different in number of sources of market distortion and number of tax instruments. Our calibration clearly shows that optimal taxes in an imperfectly competitive economy incur lower social cost than those in a competitive economy, implying that they are generally more <b>efficient</b> as <b>competition</b> enhancing policy tools. We find that optimal taxes in our models can cost up to 48 % less forgone consumption relative to those in a competitive market economy. Optimal taxation; Ramsey Problem; Welfare Cost...|$|R

We first charac-terize the equilibrium {{use of information}} and show how strategic payoff effects can heighten the sensitivity of equilibrium actions to noise. We next characterize the efficient use of information, which allows us to address whether such heightened sensitivity is socially undesirable. We show how the efficient use of information trades off volatility for dispersion, and how this relates to the socially optimal degree of coordination. We finally show how the relation between equilibrium and efficient use of information is instrumental in understanding the social value of information. We conclude with a few applications, including production externalities, Keynesian frictions, inefficient fluctuations, <b>efficient</b> market <b>competition,</b> and large Cournot and Bertrand games...|$|R
