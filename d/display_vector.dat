5000|$|The term [...] "vector graphics" [...] {{is mainly}} used {{today in the}} context of {{two-dimensional}} computer graphics. It is one of several modes an artist can use to create an image on a raster <b>display.</b> <b>Vector</b> graphics can be uploaded to online databases for other designers to download and manipulate, speeding up the creative process. Other modes include text, multimedia, and 3D rendering. Virtually all modern 3D rendering is done using extensions of 2D vector graphics techniques.

5000|$|For a {{class in}} the fall of 1976, Greg Thompson (computer design), Mark Horowitz (display processor) and George Woltman (firmware) built a [...] "hardware" [...] version of Maze entirely from 7400 series TTL circuits, {{essentially}} creating a Maze computer with 256 16-bit instructions and 256 bytes of RAM, dedicated solely to playing Maze for up to 4 human players and 4 robots. Arcade games such as Pong had used this approach before. The TTL version of Maze used Tektronix oscilloscopes to <b>display</b> <b>vector</b> graphics. This was natural, since the Imlacs also used vector displays. This version introduced a full third dimension, by having a four-level maze with players able to climb up and down between levels. Robots players were also implemented in the firmware. Their skill level was controlled by simply adjusting the clock rate of the system. The game was so popular that even though it had been built as a MIT 6.111/6.112 class project it was kept assembled and operational for over a year.|$|E

5000|$|Odyssey {{became the}} {{template}} for subsequent GIS software, cited as an inspiration by numerous commercial efforts in mapping and architecture, such as M&S Computing (later Intergraph), Computervision, and Geodat. [...] The Laboratory {{was an enormous}} influence on the commercial Environmental Systems Research Institute, Esri, founded in 1969 by Jack Dangermond, a landscape architect graduate of Harvard Graduate School of Design who {{had worked as a}} research assistant at the Laboratory during 1968 and 1969. Scott Morehouse, the development lead for the Odyssey project, worked at the lab from 1977 to 1981. When revenues from Odyssey did not meet expectations, his team's resources started to dwindle, and Morehouse left to join Jack at Esri to build a next-generation GIS platform that was to be ArcInfo. Scott's intimate knowledge of the Odyssey geoprocessing model and code base, combined with Jack's insights into how to put the 'IS' in 'GIS' evolved the Laboratory's GIS prototype processors into a system that could effectively and interactively manage, process, edit, and <b>display</b> <b>vector</b> geodata and its scalar attributes that addressed evolving market needs for more robust GIS capabilities.|$|E

We demonstrate that antibodies with desirable characteristics from a nonimmune source may be selected and affinity maturation may be achieved by using the twin vectors pComb 8 and pComb 3, thus opening the route to obtaining specific antibodies from a generic library and bypassing immunization...|$|E
40|$|The Baculovirus {{system has}} been {{increasingly}} used {{as an alternative to}} the traditional expression systems in the past decade years. The ability of the virus to display the fusion protein in native conformation presumably with all the necessary posttranslational modifications in the insect host cells can augment the immunoreactivity of the displayed antigens. In addition, the expression of the proteins through the baculovirus display system allows rapid generation of effective antigens without the need for purification of the recombinant proteins. The first generation of baculovirus <b>display</b> <b>vector</b> has been developed previously by our team. To enhance the expression level of proteins and to display multiple different proteins on cell membrane, the main objective of this study in the first year is to develop a novel baculovirus <b>display</b> <b>vector</b> that can display at least three different proteins on the baculoviral envelope or cell membrane. In the second year, a novel baculovirus display system displaying the proteins of canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parovirus virus (PV), and infectious canine hepatitis (ICH) virus, will be constructed. The potential of CDV-PV-ICH-pseudotyped baculovirus as a vaccine will be evaluated in this study. 桿狀病毒應用於疫苗之研發已有多年，由於桿狀病毒具備有表現率高、後修飾作用佳、具經濟效益及安全性高之優點，因此被用以開發作為疫苗之工具。筆者研究團隊過去已成功開發第一代桿狀病毒表現呈現載體，並成功應用於禽類疫苗之研發。本計畫第一年將著重於第二代桿狀病毒多重呈現系統之研發，期將桿狀病毒表現呈現載體改造可同時呈現多個蛋白於細胞膜或病毒封套。此新型桿狀病毒表現呈現載體系統將可大幅提升病毒蛋白之表現量及可同時表現多種蛋白於細胞膜或病毒封套，並以細胞做為製備疫苗之抗原，不需要進一步純化蛋白，因此可降低疫苗製造之成本。本計畫第二年擬以新建構之第二代桿狀病毒多重呈現載體應用於構築基因重組桿狀病毒以同時呈現犬隻三種重要病毒包含犬瘟熱病毒、犬小病毒及犬傳染性肝炎病毒蛋白於細胞膜，並以此細胞抗原做為研發犬隻之三價次單位疫苗...|$|E

40|$|Phage {{display is}} a useful means of {{identifying}} and selecting proteins of interest that bind specific targets. In order to examine the potential of phage display for the genome-wide screening of DNA-binding proteins, we constructed yeast genomic libraries using Xfoo-based vectors devised in this work. After affinity selection using GAL 4 UASG as a probe, phages expressing GAL 4 were enriched approximately 5 x lO'-fold from the li-brary. Approximately 90 % of polypeptides encoded in correct translation reading frames by the selected phages were known or putative polynucleotide-binding proteins.

The Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystal proteins are a large family of insecticidal toxins which bind to receptors found on the brush border of larval midgut cells, different crystal toxins having different larval specificities.

This forms the basis of a simple means for the modification of toxin specificity and the selection of toxin proteins with novel or expanded host ranges...|$|E
