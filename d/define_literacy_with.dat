40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{a definition}} of mobile <b>literacies,</b> <b>with</b> specific reference to higher education. This is worthwhile because although mobile, internet-enabled devices are increasingly prevalent in many people's lives, mobile literacies appear to be under-theorised and lacking definition. After giving {{an overview of the}} scale and nature of mobile device use, the paper develops the definition through building on an existing body of work which seeks to <b>define</b> <b>literacies,</b> digital literacies and mobile learning. The definition takes account of the mobility of technology, of learners, and of learning in current HE contexts. A systematic multimodal analysis of a complex undergraduate text, {{in the form of a}} conference-style poster, is then undertaken in order to exemplify the definition offered. The analysis attends to both the semiotic resources exploited by the text's author and the wider context the text is created within. Interview data complements that constructed through analysis of the text itself. Combining these two data sources reveals the ideational, interpersonal and textual/organisational meanings communicated by the text, and how mobility is a factor which is fundamental to the literacy practices employed by the author to convey these meanings...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} five middle school English teachers 2 ̆ 7 understandings of literacy and technology. In particular, how do they <b>define</b> <b>literacy,</b> view literacy and technology learning and teaching, and how do they use (or not use) technology to enact their views of literacy in their classrooms. This narrative inquiry qualitative study consisted of three open-ended interviews, written literacy narratives, and multiple classroom observations with each participant as well as the collection of various teacher documents, such as lesson plans, presentation notes, rubrics, and student handouts. Narrative methods were used in the data analysis. ^ Findings were organized across a continuum of literacy understandings from traditional understandings to new conceptions of literacy. Discussion and implications pointed to the need for an expanded definition of <b>literacy</b> <b>with</b> pre-service and practicing teachers that addresses the complexity of multiliteracies and multimodality. There was also a need for extending pedagogical repertoires of pre-service and practicing teachers to recognize TPACK as a beginning to multiliteracies as well as adopting a pedagogy of design, and incorporating critical literacy into instruction. Finally, pre-service and practicing teachers must be afforded the opportunity to conduct their own action-research to develop their knowledge base for teaching. ...|$|R

40|$|Family {{reading is}} very {{important}} for child's development and its positive effects will show throughout his life. These effects will not only contribute to his liking and wanting to read books but he will also be proficient and inventive. Since parents are the main actors in family reading, I wanted to analyse how motivated they are for family reading and describe my findings in the following thesis. A child might not come to conclusion that books are important, useful and intriguing if parents are not interested in family reading and are therefore not willing to promote reading, which can make them a bad role model. In my theoretical part I <b>defined</b> <b>literacy,</b> what family literacy is and which activities can help to develop it. I described different aspects of reading motivation and presented family reading and reading development. I also connected family reading and family <b>literacy</b> <b>with</b> the existing lesson plan. In the empirical part of my thesis I carried out a research which tried to answer the following questions: Are the parents of first and second grade pupils familiar with the meaning of family reading? Do they carry it out? How do they perceive it? I also focused on the additional activities which take place during reading. The answers showed quite encouraging results. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Making Meaning, Out of Meaning Making by Alda M. Blakeney This study {{examines}} {{the ways in}} which three elementary teachers appropriated and implemented a <b>defined</b> <b>literacy</b> curriculum in their classrooms. The overarching question guiding the study is, “What are the social and cultural patterns of meaning making in the literacy practices of three elementary teachers?” The study is framed by sociocultural perspectives of learning (Bourdieu, 1986; Gee, n. d; Vygotsky, 1978). Literacy practices involve the cultural, social, political, and historical ways of interacting and making sense of the world. Therefore, to study literacy practices of three elementary teachers means to study the social and cultural contexts in which they occur. Field notes, interviews, and teacher-produced artifacts were analyzed using emergent coding schemes (Spradley, 1979; LeCompte and Schensul, 1999). Findings from the study revealed that the literacy practices of these three teachers were standards driven, emphasizing a foundational approach to literacy development. Additionally, the teachers focused on transforming Spanish speakers into English readers. These findings suggest that the social and cultural patterns of meaning making between and among teachers and learners are not equally represented in the curriculum. Moreover, the teachers did not disrupt commonly held beliefs and practices about literacy, thereby maintaining the status quo. Implications for this study including equipping teachers, both pre-service and in-service with knowledge of critical theory and <b>literacy,</b> <b>with</b> a goal of increased engagement in literacy practices and a democratized production of knowledge...|$|R
