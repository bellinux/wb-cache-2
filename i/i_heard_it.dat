500|$|However, it {{was later}} {{reported}} that the music video directed by Tilley was scrapped, and re-shot with Director X on the week of April 21, 2012. The second version of the video premiered on May 3, 2012 on MTV. Director X summarized the synopsis of the video saying, [...] "it was just cars and the simplicity that they liked.

Rufus Wainwright named Bush as one of his top ten gay icons. Outside music, Bush has been an inspiration to several fashion designers, including Hussein Chalayan.|$|E
500|$|One thing I {{remember}} {{having had a}} really depressing effect on me was the first Ramones album. When <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> , I mean {{it was a great}} record... but I hated it because I knew we'd been doing this sort of stuff for years.

500|$|A {{week later}} on 12 February, Sussex police, tipped {{off by the}} paper, who in turn were tipped off by Richards' chauffeur, raided a party at Keith Richards' home, Redlands.

Richards said in 2003, [...] "When we got busted at Redlands, it suddenly made us realize {{that this was a}} whole different ball game and that was when the fun stopped.

[...] Cruise met with Spielberg during the filming of Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can (2002) and gave three options of films to create together, one of them being an adaptation of The War of the Worlds.

She stated: [...] "When I first read the book, I thought, 'This would be a great film,' and boy was I wrong. It's a much better TV series. Fast forward, I knew that Frank had initially developed it for NBC, which to me seemed like an odd pairing for this. Then <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> wasn't going forward at NBC so I talked to Frank." [...] On January 20, 2010, AMC officially announced that it had ordered a pilot with Darabont and Hurd acting as executive producers; the former wrote the script and directed the episode. The entire series was pre-ordered based on the strength of the source material, the television scripts, and Darabont's involvement.|$|E

500|$|Barlow's manager, Simon Fuller, chose Stephen Lipson {{to produce}} the song, seeing his success with 1980s artists like Grace Jones and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Although the song did not sound like what Barlow would usually record, he {{nevertheless}} explained in an interview: [...] "It {{took me a while}} to get my interpretation right because Madonna had written from a female point of view. It's not the kind of song I would write myself. But as soon as <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it,</b> I thought 'This is a hit'." [...] A dance-pop song, [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] is set in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Barlow's voice spans between the nodes of Cm and A3 and has a basic chord progression of C–A–B–Cm in the pre-chorus and E–B–D–A–C–E–A–Cm in the chorus.|$|E
500|$|Due to the song's success, In the Groove was re-issued as <b>I</b> <b>Heard</b> <b>It</b> Through the Grapevine and {{peaked at}} number {{two on the}} R album chart and number sixty-three on the album chart, which {{was at the time}} Marvin's highest-charted solo studio effort to date. Because of the success of both versions, [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" [...] was the first and last number one on the Billboard R chart in 1968: the Pips version was the first week of January, the Gaye version the last week of December. Gladys Knight was not pleased that Gaye's version usurped her own, and claimed that Gaye's version was {{recorded}} over an instrumental track Whitfield had prepared for a Pips song, an allegation Gaye denied. In 1985, one year following Gaye's death, the song was re-released in the UK reaching number eight thanks to a Levi's commercial (starring Nick Kamen).|$|E
500|$|The film stars Shiv Pandit and Dhruv Ganesh; {{the former}} {{came across the}} film's script during a casual meeting with Saria. In an {{interview}} with Daily News and Analysis, Pandit discussed the meeting between him and Saria, saying, [...] "He {{had no desire to}} cast me, [...] because he thought I do only commercial films. I had to force it out of him. But when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> I found it interesting and we decided to do it". Saria called Ganesh for the table read for the protagonist of the film, Sahil, and was greatly impressed by his approach to the character. However, Ganesh was apprehensive about playing the character, but after initial scepticism he agreed to play the role. Siddharth Menon and Rishabh J. Chaddha play supporting roles in the film. The film marked the last film role for Ganesh, as he died of tuberculosis in January 2015, while the film was in post-production. The opening credits in the film's final cut honour his memory.|$|E
