5|$|Because {{different}} embeddings {{may lead}} to different dual graphs, testing whether one graph is a dual of another (without already knowing their embeddings) is a nontrivial algorithmic problem. For biconnected graphs, it can be solved in polynomial time by using the SPQR trees of the graphs to construct a canonical form for the <b>equivalence</b> <b>relation</b> of having a shared mutual dual. For instance, the two red graphs in the illustration are equivalent according to this relation. However, for planar graphs that are not biconnected, this relation is not an <b>equivalence</b> <b>relation</b> {{and the problem of}} testing mutual duality is NP-complete.|$|E

There are several efficient linear time algorithms for finding the strongly connected components of a graph, based on depth first search: Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm and the path-based strong component algorithm each perform a single depth first search. Kosaraju's algorithm performs two depth first searches, but is very simple.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to study those pairs of {{complementary}} <b>equivalence</b> <b>relations</b> on a fixed set which are maximal as families of mutually complementary <b>equivalence</b> <b>relations.</b> The existence of such pairs on uncountable sets was proved by Steprāns and Watson (1995).

We study in detail the case when: (a) one of the <b>equivalence</b> <b>relations</b> in the pair has precisely two equivalence classes; (b) one of the <b>equivalence</b> <b>relations</b> has at most three equivalence classes; (c) in one of the <b>equivalence</b> <b>relations</b> all but one equivalence classes are singletons.

After establishing a containment hierarchy, {{the complexity of}} canonical function computation {{and a number of}} class membership decision problems are studied. The following classes are considered: (1) rational <b>equivalence</b> <b>relations,</b> (2) <b>equivalence</b> kernels of rational functions, (3) deterministic rational <b>equivalence</b> <b>relations,</b> (4) <b>equivalence</b> kernels of subsequential functions, (5) recognizable <b>equivalence</b> <b>relations,</b> (6) length-bounded rational <b>equivalence</b> <b>relations,</b> and (7) finite <b>equivalence</b> <b>relations.</b> Except for one open case, Hasse diagrams are given to show the relative containments in the general and one-letter-alphabet cases. Canonical function application for an input of length n is shown to be O(n 2) time and space for (1), O(n) time and space for (2), (3), and (6), and O(n) time and constant space for the others. It is shown that transitivity, symmetry, reflexivity, and membership in any of (1) through (5) are undecidable properties for rational relations whereas membership in (6) or (7) is decidable...|$|R

Simultaneous Borel embeddings and isomorphisms are defined analogously. We classify all pairs E⊆ F of smooth countable Borel <b>equivalence</b> <b>relations</b> up to simultaneous Borel bireducibility and biembeddability, and a significant portion of such pairs up to simultaneous Borel isomorphism. We generalize Mauldin's notion of Borel parametrization in order to identify large natural subclasses of pairs of smooth countable <b>equivalence</b> <b>relations</b> and of singleton smooth (not necessarily countable) <b>equivalence</b> <b>relations</b> for which the natural combinatorial isomorphism invariants are complete, and we present counterexamples outside these subclasses.

The Borel reductions are replaced by the more general class of infinite time computable functions. Many basic aspects of the classical theory remain intact, with the added bonus that it becomes sensible to study some special <b>equivalence</b> <b>relations</b> whose complexity is beyond Borel or even analytic. We also introduce an infinite time generalization of the countable Borel <b>equivalence</b> <b>relations,</b> a key subclass of the Borel <b>equivalence</b> <b>relations,</b> and again show that several key properties carry over to the larger class.
