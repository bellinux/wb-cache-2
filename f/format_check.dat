Two {{types of checks}} are applied: 1. <b>Format</b> <b>checks.</b> Ensures the file formats match the Argo standards precisely. 2. Data consistency checks. Additional data consistency checks are performed on a file after it passes the <b>format</b> <b>checks.</b> These checks do not duplicate any of the quality control checks performed elsewhere. These checks {{can be thought of}} as “sanity checks” to ensure that the data are consistent with each other. The data consistency checks enforce data standards and ensure that certain data values are reasonable and/or consistent with other information in the files. Examples of the “data standard” checks are the “mandatory parameters” defined for meta-data files and the technical parameter names in technical data files. Files with format or consistency errors are rejected by the GDAC and are not distributed. Less serious problems will generate warnings and the file will still be distributed on the GDAC.

Its second {{role is to}} manipulate and analyse the input and output files {{from a variety of}} electronic structure codes, including Castep, Onetep and Vasp, as well as the widely-used `Gaussian cube' file format. Analysis includes symmetry analysis, and arbitrary cell transformations. It continues to be under development, with growing functionality, and is written in a form which would make it easy to extend it to working directly with files from other electronic structure codes. Data which c 2 x is capable of extracting from Castep's binary checkpoint files include charge densities, spin densities, wavefunctions, relaxed atomic positions, forces, the Fermi level, the total energy, and symmetry operations. It can recreate. cell input files from checkpoint files. Volumetric data can be output in formats usable by many common visualisation programs, and c 2 x will itself calculate integrals, expand data into supercells, and interpolate data via combinations of Fourier and trilinear interpolation. It can extract data along arbitrary lines (such as between atoms) as 1 D output. C 2 x is able to convert between several common formats for describing molecules and crystals, including the. cell format of Castep. It can construct supercells, reduce cells to their primitive form, and add specified k-point meshes. It uses the spglib library to report symmetry information, which it can add to. cell files. C 2 x is a command-line utility, so is readily included in scripts. It is available under the GPL and can be obtained from [URL] It {{is believed to be the}} only open-source code which can read Castep's. check files, so it will have utility in other projects.

To the 2003 version of 4581 photographic orbits compiled from 17 different stations and {{obtained in the}} period 1936 - 1996, additional new 211 orbits compiled from 7 sources have been added. Thus, the updated version of the catalogue contains 4792 photographic orbits (equinox J 2000. 0) available either in two separate orbital and geophysical data files or a file with the merged data.

Keywords astronomical databases photographic meteor orbits 1 Introduction Meteoroid orbits are a basic tool for investigation of distribution and spatial structure of the meteoroid population in the close surroundings of the Earth s orbit. However, information about them is usually widely scattered in literature and often in publications with limited circulation. Therefore, the IAU Comm. 22 during the 1976 IAU General Assembly proposed to establish a meteor data center for collection of meteor orbits recorded by photographic and radio techniques. The decision was confirmed by the next IAU GA in 1982 and the data center was established (Lindblad, 1987). The purpose of the data center was to acquire, <b>format,</b> <b>check</b> and disseminate information on precise meteoroid orbits obtained by multi-station techniques and the database gradually extended as documented in previous reports on the activity of the Meteor Data Center by Lindblad (1987, 1995, 1999 and 2001) or Lindblad and Steel (1993). Up to present, the database consists of 4581 photographic meteor orbits (Lindblad et al., 2005), 63. 330 radar determined orbit: Harvard Meteor Project (1961 - 1965, 1968 - 1969), Adelaide (1960 - 1961, 1968 - 1969), Kharkov (1975), Obninsk (1967 - 1968), Mogadish (1969 - 1970) and 1425 video-recordings (Lindblad, 1999) to which additional 817 video meteors orbits published by Koten el al.

The algorithm takes into account 90 th percentile detection limits and dilution factors. When there is not enough data on a well to predict a trend, the algorithm uses data from all wells that are in same well group.

It is expected that the design feature of the system could contribute to the usage of the system by users (managers and executives) in performing their job task in their daily routine. Extensive literature review on the technology acceptance have been made. The objectives of this study are twofold. First, the study ranks the importance of the design feature placed by the respondents based on selected variables and characteristics of the system. Second, ERP system were correlated to the user's prior familiarity with the system. The study explores the association between these variables. The first findings on design feature revealed that the respondents had ranked variables such as content, system integration, mathematical accuracy, multi-level security, password security, processing option capability in their respective order of importance in term of usage. Visual attractiveness of the ERP system was not given high ranking by the users. On the question of "ease-of-use", the respondents had identified variables such as visual attractiveness, real-time integration and on-line function to have major influence on their perception of the system's capability in performing its task. In addition, the respondents have also perceived that the system's integration, data sequencing capability, programmed <b>format</b> <b>checks,</b> multi-level security and password security to influence them in terms of the usefulness of the system, In general, the respondents felt that they should be familiar with the system in order to improve their perceptions on the usefulness {{and ease of use}} of the system...|$|R
