25|$|Nicolas Flamel is a {{well-known}} alchemist, but {{a good example of}} pseudepigraphy, the practice of <b>giving</b> <b>your</b> works the name of someone else, usually more famous. Though the historical Flamel existed, the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 1612. Flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors, and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher's stone. His work spends {{a great deal of time}} describing the processes and reactions, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations. Most of 'his' work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him, especially as regarded the philosopher's stone. Through the 14th and 15th centuries, alchemists were much like Flamel: they concentrated on looking for the philosophers' stone. Bernard Trevisan and George Ripley made similar contributions. Their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art.|$|E
500|$|Bagwell {{made his}} first public {{appearance}} at Minute Maid Park {{since the end of}} his career on June 28, 2007. Former teammate and long-time friend Biggio had just logged his 3,000th career hit in the seventh inning against the Colorado Rockies. Bagwell, who was in the dugout, emerged to congratulate him. The Astros fans, who had momentarily quieted after cheering Biggio for his achievement, erupted into cheers again the moment Biggio dragged Bagwell onto the playing field and to the first base line. [...] "The thing with Baggy is that he and I worked so hard here for this city and for this organization", Biggio remarked. [...] "We made so many sacrifices as far as playing the game and <b>giving</b> <b>your</b> body to a city, a team." [...] Together, they bowed to the crowd as Bagwell raised Biggio's arm, and returned to the dugout. Biggio was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015.|$|E
