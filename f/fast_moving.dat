5|$|After {{the nine}} Études-Tableaux, Op. 39, Rachmaninoff {{composed}} several minor works in 1917. The Oriental Sketch is a fast-paced piece littered with sixteenth note figures. The piece {{was not intended}} {{to be associated with the}} Orient; the title was given by the publisher. The Prelude in D minor, a dark piece with thick and <b>fast</b> <b>moving</b> chords that repeatedly descend into low register, is a manifestation of his unhappiness with the October Revolution. The manuscript survived and was first published in 1973. His penultimate piano composition (only his Corelli Variations came later) was a one-page piece entitled Fragments, a brief nostalgic piece from his final days in Moscow. It was first published in the magazine, The Etude, in 1919.|$|E
50|$|The {{viscosity}} of gases is {{the result}} in the transfer of each molecule of gas as they pass each other from layer to layer. As gases tend to pass one another, the velocity, {{in the form of}} momentum, of the <b>faster</b> <b>moving</b> molecule speeds up the slower moving molecule. As the slower moving molecule passes the <b>faster</b> <b>moving</b> molecule, the momentum of the slower moving particle slows down the <b>faster</b> <b>moving</b> particle. The molecules continue to enact until frictional drag causes both molecules to equalize their velocities.|$|R

5|$|By the 1880s and 1890s, {{both the}} power of naval {{artillery}} and the speed of warships had further increased, leading to further investment in the castle between 1888 and 1893. The keep's magazine, which could hold up to 2,250 shells, was reinforced with concrete and the south bastion of the old castle was filled in with shingle and concrete for additional protection. New 6-pounder (2.7kg) quick-firing guns were installed in a battery {{on the end of}} the east wing, supported by machine guns, to enable them to target <b>fast</b> <b>moving</b> vessels, particularly the new torpedo boats. Further emplacements for 12-pounder (5.4kg) guns followed, including one on the top of the keep.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{proximal}} series {{can be directly}} compared to the ulnare and intermedium of tetrapods. The fin was clearly weight bearing, being attached to a massive shoulder with expanded scapular and coracoid elements and attached to the body armor, large muscular scars on the ventral surface of the humerus, and highly mobile distal joints. The bones of the forefins show large muscle facets, suggesting that the fin was both muscular and {{had the ability to}} flex like a wrist joint. These wrist-like features would have helped anchor the creature to the bottom in <b>fast</b> <b>moving</b> current.|$|E
5|$|Ideal tank mates for convict {{cichlids}} {{consists of}} robust similar sized fish. Such fish include T-Bar cichlids, Honduran red points, Green Terrors, Jewel cichlids, Salvini, Jack Dempsey, (Keep {{in mind as}} Dempseys outgrow the convicts territorial issues will become a problem.) Pictus catfish, plecostomus, {{as well as other}} convicts. Other <b>fast</b> <b>moving</b> fish such as Giant Danios can be used as dither fish. Also remember, if you have a breeding pair Convicts in a 40-gallon or smaller you will be most likely be unable to keep the convicts with any tank mates. But if your tank mates have established any type of dominance they will however breed and live together.|$|E

50|$|Sprint medley usually {{consists}} of two shorter sprints, followed by two single longer events. Usual conduct for safety is to run the shorter events first, in lanes to allow <b>faster</b> <b>moving</b> sprinters to exchange without interference. And <b>faster</b> <b>moving</b> athletes will have a more consistent tempo to prepare a handoff than with longer sprinters who {{are more prone to}} decelerate inconsistently as they finish their leg. By running two shorter sprints, mathematically the events can be conducted over an even number of laps.|$|R
5|$|In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the {{director}} of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by <b>fast</b> <b>moving</b> neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.|$|E
5|$|A foot pursuit {{in which}} Diesel, Brewster and Walker are chased across favela rooftops by Johnson {{and his team}} was filmed {{over the course of}} a week in the small {{hillside}} town of Naranjito, Puerto Rico. The scene was considered difficult to shoot, as pathways were slippery from moist tropical heat and the scene involved actors and stunt doubles running while avoiding dogs, chickens and other stray animals loose in the area. To capture the scene, a 420-foot cable-camera rig was used to allow for a <b>fast</b> <b>moving,</b> birds-eye view of the action, and cameras on cranes were set up on rooftops and in alleyways. Walker and Brewster made multiple takes of the conclusion of the scene, requiring them to jump nearly 30 feet from a building onto a waiting safety mat. In total the production employed 236 technicians, 13,145 extras, and generated 16,824 room nights at hotels, contributing $27 million to the Puerto Rican community.|$|E
5|$|On 16 March, five {{companies}} from the Camel Corps and mounted infantry scouts, {{supported by a}} 12-pounder artillery battery and a Maxim machine gun battery, crossed the Darfur frontier and four days later occupied Um Shanga. Their only opposition was from a small observation post which was forced to withdraw. Unexpectedly, upon arrival the Anglo-Egyptian force found the water supply at Um Shanga scarce. With {{the main body of}} his force expected to arrive that evening, having only two days supply of water with them, Kelly considered withdrawing back to Sudan. Instead, he divided his force, forming a <b>fast</b> <b>moving</b> column, consisting of thirty mounted infantry scouts, 240 men from the Camel Corps, two artillery pieces and eight Maxims, which left for Jebel el Hella at dawn on 22 March.|$|E

5|$|Since their {{invention}} in 1900, reflector sights {{have come}} to be used as gun sights on all kinds of weapons. They were used on fighter aircraft, in a limited capacity in World War I, widely used in World War II, and still used as the base component in many types of modern head-up displays. They have been used in other types of (usually large) weapons as well, such as anti-aircraft gun sights, anti tank gun sights, and any other role where the operator had to engage <b>fast</b> <b>moving</b> targets over a wide field of view, and the sight itself could be supplied with sufficient electrical power to function. There was some limited use of the sight on small arms after World War II but it came into widespread use after the late 1970s with the invention of the red dot sight, with a red light-emitting diode (LED) as its reticle, making a dependable sight with durability and extremely long illumination run time.|$|E
5|$|The initial Overlord {{plan called}} for the British Second Army to secure the city and then form a front line from Caumont-l'Éventé to the {{south-east}} of Caen, to acquire space for airfields {{and to protect the}} left flank of the United States First Army while it moved on Cherbourg. Possession of Caen and its environs would give the Second Army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture Falaise, which could then be used as the pivot for a swing left to advance on Argentan and then towards the Touques River. The terrain between Caen and Vimont was especially attractive to Allied planners, being open, dry and conducive to swift offensive operations. Since the Allies greatly outnumbered the Germans in tanks and mobile units, creating the conditions for a fluid, <b>fast</b> <b>moving</b> battle was to their advantage.|$|E
5|$|Gannets, boobies, tropicbirds, some terns {{and brown}} {{pelicans}} all engage in plunge diving, taking <b>fast</b> <b>moving</b> prey by diving {{into the water}} from flight. Plunge diving allows birds to use the energy from {{the momentum of the}} dive to combat natural buoyancy (caused by air trapped in plumage), and thus uses less energy than the dedicated pursuit divers, allowing them to utilise more widely distributed food resources, for example, in impoverished tropical seas. In general, this is the most specialised method of hunting employed by seabirds; other non-specialists (such as gulls and skuas) may employ it but do so with less skill and from lower heights. In brown pelicans the skills of plunge diving take several years to fully develop—once mature, they can dive from 20m (70ft) above the water's surface, shifting the body before impact to avoid injury. It has been suggested that plunge divers are restricted in their hunting grounds to clear waters that afford a view of their prey from the air, and while they are the dominant guild in the tropics, the link between plunge diving and water clarity is inconclusive. Some plunge divers (as well as some surface feeders) are dependent on dolphins and tuna to push shoaling fish up towards the surface.|$|E

5|$|In Nicaragua, floods {{from the}} storm forced 3,962 people to {{evacuate}} their houses to 57 shelters, {{many of which were}} schools. Floods affected 11 of the 17 Departments of Nicaragua, which began receding on October 5 as Keith exited the region. The floods caused several landslides and covered roads, which isolated communities. Keith damaged 436 houses in the country and destroyed another 160. There were 12 fatalities due to the storm in Nicaragua, one of whom a boy who was swept away by a <b>fast</b> <b>moving</b> flooded river northeast of Managua, while another death occurred after a man drowned in Lake Managua. A man in the western portions of the country died after stepping on a power lines, which had fallen due to strong winds. Fifty communities were isolated, with at least thirteen of them due to impassable roads. Several neighborhoods in Corinto flooded, forcing the Civil Defense to evacuate 9 families. One house collapsed in Los Ángeles, though its ten occupant escape without injury. After rainfall lashed In Villanueva, Chinandega, for six days, the resultant flooding forced 300 families evacuated, while there was significant losses the corn, beans and plantains crops. An additional 20 families left their homes due to flooding in Poneloya. About 15 families in the port city of Puerto Sandino were evacuated after the El Contrabando river overflowed. Another 18 homes were flooded in the region of Salinas Grandes. About 52 fled Troilo after at least 11 homes flooded.|$|E
5|$|Karas {{impressed}} its reviewers {{with its}} animated imagery. Mania Entertainment affirmed its lush imagery {{are enough to}} hook viewers, and certain 2D-3D scenes matched photorealistic standards. They felt Karas could rival or beat live-action films in the visual department. DVD Talk commented they saw evidence {{a lot of effort}} went into merging the 2D and 3D animations. They, however, felt setting the scenes in darkness and obscuring points of interest with smoke or other effects marred the high quality imagery. Anime News Network stated the richly detailed images; <b>fast</b> <b>moving</b> action scenes; and visual effects of collapsing buildings, explosions, and blood made Karas one of the best action animation. Reviewers praised the fight scenes between the CG generated karas and mikuras, declaring them realistic, tasteful and stunning. DVD Talk, however, complained the camera jerked and moved all over the place never showing fights cleanly. Mania stated the fights in the later half failed to match those in the first half in terms of beauty, intensity, and variety; the overlaying of characters' face onto their armored forms in the finale detracted from their viewing experience.|$|E

40|$|The peak {{frequency}} of neuronal gamma-band synchronization has received much attention in recent years. Gamma {{peak frequency}} shifts to higher frequency values for higher contrast, <b>faster</b> <b>moving,</b> and attended stimuli. In monkey V 1, gamma peak frequency for a drifting grating is higher for a parafoveal {{as compared to}} an eccentric stimulus (Lima et al., 2010). This effect {{might be due to}} the cortical magnification factor: the higher cortical magnification for parafoveal stimuli increases the velocity with which the cortical representations of the moving grating stripes move across the cortical surface. Since <b>faster</b> <b>moving</b> stimuli lead to higher gamma frequency, a <b>faster</b> <b>moving</b> cortical representation might do the same. This explanation predicts that the eccentricity effect on gamma peak frequency is absent for stationary stimuli. To test this, we investigated the effect of eccentricity on gamma peak frequency by recording magnetoencephalography in human subjects while they viewed moving or stationary gratings. We found that both the moving and the stationary stimuli induced lower peak frequencies for larger eccentricities, arguing against an explanation based on the cortical magnification factor. We further investigated whether this eccentricity effec...|$|R
