40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the European type-approval test procedure for evaporative emissions from passenger cars based on real-world mobility data. The study relies on two large databases of driving patterns from conventional fuel vehicles collected by means of on-board GPS systems in the Italian provinces of Modena and Firenze. Approximately 28, 000 vehicles were monitored, corresponding to approximately 36 millionkilometres over a period of one month. The driving pattern of each vehicle was processed to derive the relation between trip length and parking duration, and the rate of occurrence of parking events against multiple evaporative cycles, defined {{on the basis of the}} type-approval test procedure as 12 -hour diurnal time windows. These results are used as input for an emission simulation model, which calculates the total evaporative emissions given the characteristics of the <b>evaporative</b> <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> of the vehicle and the ambient temperature conditions. The results suggest that the <b>evaporative</b> <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> fitted to the vehicles from Euro 3 step and optimised for the current type-approval test procedure, could not efficiently work under real-world conditions, resulting in evaporative emissions well above the type-approval limit, especially for small size vehicles and warm climate conditions.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{assesses the}} {{effectiveness}} of the <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> of European passenger cars on the basis of real-world activity data. The study relies on two large datasets of driving patterns from conventional fuel vehicles collected by means of on-board GPS systems, consisting of 4. 5 million trips and parking events recorded by monitoring 28, 000 vehicles over one month. Real world <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> are estimated using a model that associates a carbon canister desorption event to each trip and a fuel vapour generation event to each parking. The mass of volatile organic compounds released into the air is calculated taking into account the hot-soak, permeation and breathing emission mechanisms. The analysis is based on 36 scenarios, defined by varying the climate conditions, the fuel vapour pressure, the tank material, the tank headspace volume, the purging volume flow rate and the mass of the activated carbon contained in the canister. The results show that in May 4 out of the 18 scenarios considered for Modena and 6 out of the 18 scenarios considered for Firenze lead to <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> values above the current type approval limit (i. e. 2 [g/day] per vehicle). In July, these numbers increase to 10 out of the 18 scenarios for Modena and to 12 out of the 18 scenarios for Firenze. Looking at the fleet distribution a share of approximately 20 % of the fleet is characterised by <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> higher than the limit in May, increasing to 48 % in July, with a peak value of 98 %. The emission peak value is estimated to be approximately 4 [g/day] in May and 8 [g/day] in July, while the time-dependent results show emission rates up to nearly 15 [g/s] in Modena and 30 [g/s] in Firenze, with a respective cumulative value in July up to 0. 4 and 0. 8 tons of VOCs per day. The space-dependent results show a value of the emissions in July of approximately 4 -to- 8 [kg/km 2 /day] in the city areas. These results confirm previous findings from the authors, highlighting how the <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> currently used in passenger cars might not be effective under real-world use condition, calling for a revision of the type-approval test procedure...|$|R
