25|$|Some {{researchers}} <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{may indicate}} that the Na-Dené migration occurred from the Russian Far East after the initial Paleo-Indian colonization, but prior to modern Inuit, Inupiat and Yupik expansions.|$|E
25|$|Many logicians <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{symmetric}} presentation {{offers a}} deeper insight {{in the structure}} of the logic than other styles of proof system, where the classical duality of negation is not as apparent in the rules.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> media {{coverage}} may be slightly overstated, {{but it is}} generally agreed that the case {{is the most important}} case regarding the scope of the Federal Parliament's power since the Tasmanian Dams Case in 1983.|$|E

5000|$|... "Opened his mouth" [...] was {{a common}} Semitic {{expression}} at the time, well attested in literature from the period. In the New Testament it also appears Acts 8:35 and 10:34. Gundry <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a reference to Matthew 4:4 that mentions [...] "every word out of the mouth of God." [...] Gundry thus <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> turn of phrase is meant {{to imply that the}} Sermon are words spoken by God. Luke's Sermon on the Plain opens with Jesus [...] "lifting up his eyes", and the two phrases might be related.|$|R
5000|$|... varṇa-sphoṭa, at the {{syllable}} level. George Cardona <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{remains an}} abstraction of sound, a further refinement on Patañjali for {{the concept of}} phoneme- now it stands for units of sound.|$|R
25|$|There is {{also some}} {{moderate}} debate sparked by Uglies {{over the issue}} of monitoring people. The state has started to track teens through their cell phones and on occasion through dental implants. Westerfeld feels that this will “result in a total loss of privacy,” however, others <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> technology is necessary to properly supervise people.|$|E
25|$|Other albums {{included}} The Tokyo Concert (1973); Since We Met (1974); and But Beautiful (1974), {{featuring the}} trio plus saxophonist Stan Getz in live performances from the Netherlands and Belgium. Morell was an energetic, straight-ahead drummer, {{unlike many of}} the trio's former percussionists, and many critics <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{was a period of}} little growth for Evans. After Morell left, Evans and Gómez recorded two duo albums, Intuition and Montreux III.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefit of}} {{skinning}} in user interfaces is disputed. While some find it useful or pleasant {{to be able}} to change the appearance of software, a changed appearance can complicate technical support and training. A user interface that has been extensively customized by one person may appear completely unfamiliar to another who knows the software under a different appearance. Some usability practitioners <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> flexibility requires interaction design expertise that users might not have.|$|E
5000|$|While Scalia {{acknowledges}} that the PLRA explicitly contemplates prospective prisoner release orders, he <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> reading of the statute should be construed so as to not [...] "veer significantly from the historical role" [...] of the courts.|$|R
50|$|If {{the reader}} <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was {{an inordinate amount}} of brain-twisting work for a three gate {{improvement}} in a multi-cycle critical path, then the reader has a better appreciation for the level to which modern CPUs are optimized.|$|R
50|$|Only {{the initial}} {{portion of the}} project was budgeted, and using only rough numbers, but the {{committee}} <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> can be completed for between $600 million to $900 million, including the downtown tunnel portion, within the following 5-10 years.|$|R
25|$|The end of UDI {{and of the}} Bush War were {{associated}} with an abrupt transfer of power to the insurgent backed, black political parties in 1980. Some observers <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> resulted {{in some of the}} more stable elements in black civil society being marginalised. Consequently, Zimbabwe was not able to enjoy benefits of a managed transfer to democracy of the kind that took place in comparable neighbouring countries such as Botswana and South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Within the Pagan movement, {{there can}} be found many deities, both male and female, who have various {{associations}} and embody forces of nature, aspects of culture, and facets of human psychology. These deities are typically depicted in human form, and are viewed as having human faults. They are therefore not seen as perfect, but rather are venerated as being wise and powerful. Pagans <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> understanding of the gods reflected the dynamics of life on Earth, allowing for the expression of humour.|$|E
25|$|The true vernacular {{novel was}} {{developed}} in China during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 AD). Some authors feel that China originated the novel form with the Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong (in the 14th century), although others <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> epic is distinct from the novel in key ways. Fictional novels published during the Ming period include the Water Margin and the Journey to the West, which represent two of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature.|$|E

25|$|Early theorists such {{as these}} saw no agency {{whatsoever}} for audiences of the culture industry, claiming instead that this industry was founded on mass deception and that the average consumer was a cultural dupe being inculcated into {{the values of the}} ruling classes without realizing it. Many critics of this school <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> represented a reintroduction of Marx’s ideas about mediation, or media as purveyors of a dominant ideology that destroyed the possibility that audiences for mass media were able to work against these ruling ideas.|$|E
25|$|Poverty {{can lead}} to {{increased}} trafficking in many different ways. Poverty affects the notion of individual choice and often drives families to make decisions out of desperation and lack of education. Poverty, in some countries, may influence parents {{to send their children}} to work in another urban country with a more stable economy, such as the U.S., without the knowledge that the child is then forced into slave labor or prostitution. Furthermore, once this kidnapping and trafficking of the child occurs, the victim often accepts their situation and limits efforts to escape their imprisonment. Oftentimes, they wind up alone in a country where they do not speak the language, making it difficult to seek aid. In addition, victims often accept their positions because they <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the only way that they may send some remittances to their family and their enslaved situations may in some cases still be better than their original impoverished and desperate state.|$|E
25|$|The first passage {{has been}} {{interpreted}} both literally, allegorically and otherwise. Although some commentators <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> passage referred to a physical miracle, where Abraham was physically shown the entire kingdom of Heaven (Jannah), others have felt that {{it refers to the}} spiritual understanding of Abraham; these latter scholars maintain that the Chaldeans were skilled in the observance of the stars, but Abraham, who lived amongst them, saw beyond the physical world and into a higher spiritual realm. The second passage has one mainstream interpretation amongst the Qur'anic commentators, that Abraham took four birds and cut them up, placing pieces of each on nearby hills; when he called out to them, each piece joined and four birds flew back to Abraham. This miracle, as told by the Qur'anic passage, was a demonstration by God to show Abraham how God gave life to the dead. As the physical cutting of the birds is not implied in the passage, some commentators have offered alternative interpretations, but all maintain that the miracle was for the same demonstrative purpose to show Abraham the power God has to raise the dead to life. The third passage has also been interpreted both literally and metaphorically, or in some cases both. Commentators state that the 'fire' refers to main aspects. They maintained that, firstly, the fire referred to the physical flame, from which Abraham was saved unharmed. The commentators further stated that, secondly, the fire referred to the 'fire of persecution', from which Abraham was saved, as he left his people after this with his wife Sarah and his nephew Lot.|$|E

50|$|Krannert's {{work at the}} Anderson plant {{were rewarded}} with the company's {{president}} offering him a position as a vice president and director, with the caveat that Krannert {{would be required to}} vote as the president voted. <b>Feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> directive was unprofessional and unethical, he left the company.|$|R
500|$|FireRed and LeafGreens {{connectivity}} {{with the}} Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter was heralded by Nintendo president Satoru Iwata as being able [...] "to enhance head-to-head battles, exchange of information, and communication with others." [...] An enhanced interface {{was created for}} the game to increase usability for new players, {{as well as a}} contextual in-game help system that could aid lost or confused players during their journey. President of The Pokémon Company Tsunekazu Ishiharu noted, [...] "We don't <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> a remake at all. We <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a new game, with wireless technology", referring to the bundled wireless adapter.|$|E
500|$|Aldrin added: This {{has been}} far more than three men {{on a mission to}} the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a {{government}} and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> stands {{as a symbol of the}} insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown... Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind. [...] "When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art mindful of him?" ...|$|E
500|$|Federer {{defeated}} Nadal in five compelling sets {{in three}} hours and forty-five minutes, for a fifth consecutive Wimbledon championship (equalling the feat achieved by Björn Borg). Borg himself returned to Wimbledon {{for the first time}} since losing the final in 1981, saying [...] "I just <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the right time for me to come back, to hopefully watch Roger winning his fifth title in a row to match my record." [...] This match marked only the third time in the new century that a Major final had gone to five sets, and was the first time the technology Hawk-Eye was ever used in a Wimbledon final.|$|E

50|$|However, {{shortly after}} this election, the caucus re-elected Douglas to the cabinet. <b>Feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{served as a}} motion of no-confidence on his {{continued}} leadership, and feeling that {{he could no longer}} work with Douglas in cabinet, Lange resigned in August of that year to be replaced by Geoffrey Palmer.|$|R
5000|$|Like Matthew 5:5 this verse has no {{parallel}} in Luke's Sermon on the Plain. Gundry <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> fairly straightforward construction was probably thus a creation {{by the author}} of Matthew. The theme is an obvious one for Matthew to choose. Schweizer notes that [...] "mercy is the focal point of Matthew's message." ...|$|R
500|$|In December 2010, Moqadem and Schaar filed {{a lawsuit}} against Lafosse {{demanding}} that they be able to review the film's screenplay. The 4th Civil Chamber of the Court of Brussels ruled that the lawsuit was [...] "admissible but unfounded." [...] However, production had already begun — cast negotiations were finished, and the team had already approached the French government about receiving subsidies — and Lafosse demonstrated no intent to hand over his work. The pair's lawyer subsequently released an official statement: [...] "Moqadem and Schaar <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a violation of their privacy and do not understand why the filmmakers have so little respect for them." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sometimes when I'm {{writing a}} song, {{it does come}} from such a raw place that I'm {{actually}} crying while writing it," [...] Mariah admitted. Her second single, a tribute to her late father, is also meant to reach anyone else who has suffered a loss of a loved one. [...] "Sometimes I hear it and <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is going to touch a lot of people, and that's why it's important that no matter what's {{ever happened to me}} over my career, that I stay the course and continue to write and try and reach people who need." [...] Anyone who manages to do the reverse, and touch Mariah with one of their songs, [...] "I'm indebted to them forever." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Alive" [...] is not [...] "the type of music" [...] that Lopez {{is used to}} making. According to Lopez, {{she knew}} that there was {{something}} [...] "inside of me that I have to offer to this [...] And then, you know, things happen. Things have a weird way of happening naturally and organically when they're supposed to. And I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> song was just meant to be, for this movie. Basically, I wrote the song for me to go through all these kinds of things as an actress with this character. You draw from all different experiences in your life. From way back to the present, to whatever, to make it really true and honest". [...] "Alive" [...] means [...] "the world" [...] to Lopez because of its positive message {{and the fact that it}} was something that she created with Judd.|$|E
50|$|Campion left Danelectro in 2002 {{and dove}} back into songwriting, placing songs {{in a few}} {{television}} shows, like “One Tree Hill”, through agencies that demanded to own the song’s publishing, {{in exchange for their}} placement efforts. <b>Feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was unfair, Campion formed Music Epicenter, with partner and mentor songsmith, Chris Falson in 2003.|$|R
50|$|Nolland {{notes that}} the word {{translated}} as taketh/took here and in Matthew 4:8 is the same verb as was {{used to refer to}} Joseph taking Jesus to Egypt and back in Matthew 2:14 and Matthew 2:21. Nolland <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> establishes a subtle contrast between Joseph's righteous transportation of Jesus and Satan's evil designs.|$|R
