5|$|This {{species is}} a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{widespread in the}} Americas and Europe. It can grow either singly, scattered, or in groups. It prefers habitats like coniferous and mixed forests and alongside paths, where it fruits in summer and fall. It is a toxic mushroom that has muscarine, the same toxin as Amanita muscaria and Amanita pantherina {{as well as many}} species in the Clitocybe and Inocybe genera. It is often confused with various other European species. A.gemmata resembles the false death cap, tawny <b>grisette</b> and panther cap mushrooms. Its cap is brighter in color than the former, and more yellow than the latter two.|$|E
5|$|Although very {{distinctive}} in appearance, the {{fly agaric}} has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom {{species in the}} Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basii—a Mexican species similar to A.caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.caesarea-like species in Mexico. Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white. The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may {{be confused with the}} native vermilion <b>grisette</b> (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A.muscaria and bears no ring.|$|E

25|$|Grisettes {{appeared}} in many caricatures of bohemian Paris, {{most notably in}} those by Daumier and Gavarni, {{as well as in}} illustrations of novels about them, such as Gerald du Maurier's own engravings for Trilby. The artist and war correspondent, Constantin Guys, frequently portrayed them in his sketches of Parisian life during the Second French Empire. A <b>grisette</b> likewise became the subject of one of Edward Hopper's early watercolours, painted in Paris in 1906. Hopper's portrayal, like several of those by Guys, shows the <b>grisette</b> wearing a traditional seamstress apron. However, their slightly raised skirts (particularly in the Guys sketches) and provocative poses also allude to the association of grisettes with prostitution.|$|E

500|$|Volvopluteus gloiocephalus, {{commonly}} known as the big sheath mushroom, rose-gilled <b>grisette,</b> or stubble rosegill, is a species of mushroom in the family Pluteaceae. For most of the 20th century it has been known under the names Volvariella gloiocephala or Volvariella speciosa, but recent molecular studies have placed it as the type species of the genus Volvopluteus, newly created in 2011. The cap of this mushroom is about [...] in diameter, varies from white to grey or grey-brown, and is markedly sticky when fresh. The gills start out as white but they soon turn pink. The stipe is white and has a sack-like volva at the base. Microscopical features and DNA sequence data are of great importance for separating V.gloiocephalus from related species. V.gloiocephalus is a saprotrophic fungus that grows on grassy fields and accumulations of organic matter like compost or woodchips piles. It has been reported from all continents except Antarctica.|$|E

500|$|Amanita ceciliae, {{commonly}} called snakeskin <b>grisette</b> and strangulated amanita, is a basidiomycete fungus in the genus Amanita. First described in 1854 by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Christopher Edmund Broome, {{it was given}} its current name by Cornelis Bas in 1984. It is characterized by bearing a large fruit body with a brown cap [...] across. The cap has charcoal-grey patches, which are easily removable. The stipe is [...] long, white in colour, {{and there is no}} ring on it. It is slightly tapered to the top, and has irregular cottony bands girdling the base. The universal veil is grey. Spores are white, spherical in shape, non-amyloid, and measure 10.2–11.7 micrometres. The mushrooms are considered edible, but field guides typically advise caution in selecting them for consumption, due to risks of confusion with similar toxic species. A.ceciliae is found in woods throughout Europe and North America, where it fruits during summer and autumn.|$|E

50|$|In this work, {{the author}} {{protests against the}} excesses of bigotry and, {{according}} to a principle dear to him, he contrasts the interior design of an aristocratic house with both the grime of a squalid Parisian neighbourhood and the cheerful décor of a <b>grisette's</b> apartment (another familiar theme {{in the works of}} Balzac). Madame du Granville's home is, in his eyes: a place of cold, arid solemnity, of moral rectitude and narrow-mindedness. Whereas the <b>grisette's</b> flat, like that of La Torpille (Esther Van Gobseck), is a place of delights.|$|R

2500|$|Jonathan Swift's To Betty, the <b>Grisette,</b> gives {{a rather}} jaundiced {{portrayal}} of the <b>grisette</b> and her intellectual pretensions. Swift's [...] "grisette" [...] (or [...] "grizette" [...] as spelled in early editions of his work) is Irish, not French, and demonstrates that the generic {{use of the term}} in English to indicate a woman of loose morals already existed by 1730. Betty is presumed to be a prostitute with whom Swift had consorted in Dublin.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>grisette</b> {{as part of}} the bohemian {{sub-culture}} was {{a frequent}} character in French fiction of the time. She is personified as Rigolette in Eugene Sue’s The Mysteries of Paris, as [...] Fantine in Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables and Marthe in George Sand's Horace, {{as well as in the}} protagonist in Alfred de Musset’s Mademoiselle Mimi Pinson: Profil de <b>grisette.</b> Notable examples in British and American fiction are Trilby in George Du Maurier's novel of the same name, and Marie in Edgar Allan Poe's short story [...] "The Mystery of Marie Roget". Du Maurier based large parts of Trilby on his experiences as a student in Parisian bohemia during the 1850s. Poe's 1842 story was based on the unsolved murder of Mary Cecilia Rogers near New York City. Poe translated the setting to Paris and Mary Rogers to a young <b>grisette,</b> Marie Roget. Subtitled [...] "A Sequel to 'The Murders in the Rue Morgue'", it was the first detective story to attempt the solution of a real crime. Possibly the most enduring <b>grisette</b> of all is Mimi in Henri Murger’s [...] novel (and subsequent play) Scènes de la vie de Bohème, the source for Puccini's famous opera La bohème.|$|E
2500|$|In 1730 Jonathan Swift {{was already}} using [...] "grisette" [...] in English to signify qualities of both flirtatiousness and {{intellectual}} aspiration.

5000|$|At {{one stage}} this fungus {{was known as}} Amanitopsis pulchella, a small genus that all <b>grisettes</b> (ringless Amanita species) were placed in. However, this genus has been later sunk back into Amanita. Unlike most ringless Amanita, which are part of Amanita section Vaginatae (A. vaginata and allies), A. xanthcephala belongs to Amanita section Amanita (A. muscaria and allies). http://pluto.njcc.com/~ret/amanita/species/fulva.html ...|$|R
