25|$|The {{last major}} {{tactical}} evolution {{occurred in the}} late 1980s/early 1990s, when the Milan side played with {{a variation on the}} 4–4–2 formation. This formation relied extensively on the four defenders' ability to work as a unit in order to spring the offside trap on slower attackers, as well as the stamina of the midfielders who would be expected to pressure the opposition as soon as they gained possession of the ball. In attack, the team would play short passes within the midfield, using their crisp passing and <b>dynamic</b> <b>movement</b> to open up holes in the defence and create attacking opportunities.|$|E
500|$|The {{sinking of}} the Venetian house at {{the climax of the}} film {{featured}} the largest rig ever built for a Bond film. For the scene involving Bond following Vesper into the house undergoing renovation supported by inflatable balloons, a tank was constructed at the 007 stage at Pinewood, consisting of a Venetian piazza and the interior of the three-story dilapidated house. The rig, weighing some 90 tons, incorporated electronics with hydraulic valves which were closely controlled by computer because of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>movement</b> within the system on its two axes. The same computer system also controlled the exterior model which the effects team built to one-third scale to film the building eventually collapsing into the Venetian canal. The model elevator within the rig could be immersed in [...] of water, and used banks of compressors to strictly regulate movement.|$|E
500|$|Although {{both the}} Cubists and the Futurists {{conveyed}} movement and speed within the two dimensions of a painting, it was Pollock who brought <b>dynamic</b> <b>movement</b> {{to the canvas}} in the 1950s with his form of abstract expressionism known as gestural painting in works such as Autumn Rhythm, 1950. In Little Big Painting and subsequently even more so in Big Painting No. 6 and Yellow and Green Brushstrokes, for example, dynamic activity was a prominent feature of the series. Lichtenstein's loops and depiction of sweeping gestures all resemble Pollock's gestural painting. As {{a result of this}} series, Lichtenstein was able to present works to the viewing audience that resembled what they had become accustomed to seeing, however, his result is completely flat without any trace of the brushstroke or the artist's hand. Meanwhile, the work references mechanical printing with the Ben-Day dots background, which enables Lichtenstein to parody his predecessors and make a [...] "powerful abstract composition". The effort to make the painting appear mechanically produced by flattening the brushstroke also gives the illusion that the brushstroke is floating freely.|$|E

Lowly <b>dynamic</b> <b>movements</b> with a bandwidth of up to 100 Hz and a stroke of several mm are generated by an electro-magnetically driven axis. For highly <b>dynamic</b> <b>movements</b> with a bandwidth of up to 2 kHz a piezo-actuator is used. The control of the dynamic axes bases on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) system for the feedback control and a microprocessor-based system for low level setpoint generation.

2500|$|In Baroque sculpture, {{groups of}} figures assumed new importance, {{and there was}} a <b>dynamic</b> <b>movement</b> and energy of human forms— they spiralled around an empty central vortex, or reached {{outwards}} into the surrounding space. Baroque sculpture often had multiple ideal viewing angles, and reflected a general continuation of the Renaissance move away from the relief to sculpture created in the round, and designed to be placed {{in the middle of a}} large space – elaborate fountains such as Bernini's Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Rome, 1651), or those in the Gardens of Versailles were a Baroque speciality. The Baroque style was perfectly suited to sculpture, with Gian Lorenzo Bernini the dominating figure of the age in works such as The Ecstasy of St Theresa (1647–1652). Much Baroque sculpture added extra-sculptural elements, for example, concealed lighting, or water fountains, or fused sculpture and architecture to create a transformative experience for the viewer. Artists saw themselves as in the classical tradition, but admired Hellenistic and later Roman sculpture, rather than that of the more [...] "Classical" [...] periods as they are seen today.|$|E
2500|$|Archipenko {{evolved in}} close contact with the Salon Cubists (Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, Robert Delaunay, Joseph Csaky and others). At the same time, his affinities with Futurism were {{documented}} by the British magazine The Sketch in October 1913, where Archipenko's Dancers (Dance), reproduced on its front cover, was described as a 'Futurist sculpture'. [...] "In this work", writes Alexandra Keiser, [...] "two abstracted figures are engaged in a dynamic dance movement." [...] Moreover, the chiaroscuro observed in the photographic reproduction [...] "accentuated the artist's multi-faceted use of positive and negative space as a compositional element to create <b>dynamic</b> <b>movement,</b> in both the fragmentation of the dancers' bodies {{as well as in the}} void created between their bodies". In the photographic reproduction of Dancers, writes Keiser, [...] "the sculpture is set off at an angle reinforcing the idea of dynamism and creating the illusion that the sculpture is propelled through space. The sculpture Dance itself as well as the style of its reproduction played strongly to the generalized notions of Futurism and to the idea that sculpture could be conceived as a specifically modern medium".|$|E
2500|$|The Baroque style {{dates back}} to the {{cultural}} period of the 17th and early 18th centuries. It is most often defined as [...] "the dominant style of art in Europe between the Mannerist and Rococo eras, a style characterized by <b>dynamic</b> <b>movement,</b> overt emotion and self-confident rhetoric". Carpentier first became fascinated with this style in architecture and sculpture; however, he later describes el barroco as un espíritu, and not un estilo histórico ("a spirit, not an historical style"). Wakefield insists that this attitude towards the Baroque stemmed from Carpentier's background in both Europe and Latin America which allowed him to take on a superior front in the face of post-colonialism and ultimately have the literary upper-hand where he could use European style to tell the Latin American story. Carpentier developed his vision of the baroque in his early works before he described himself as a baroque writer. He experimented with the technique in several developmental stages: [...] "first as a cultural style of aesthetic fascination, later as a literary device to create period ambiance, and finally as a weapon of postcolonial pride, defiance and one-upmanship".|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel particle filter called Motion-Adaptive Particle Filter (MAPF) to track fast-moving objects that have complex <b>dynamic</b> <b>movements.</b> The {{objective was to}} achieve effectiveness and robustness against abrupt motions and affine transformations. To that end, MAPF first predicted both velocity and acceleration according to prior data of the tracked objects, and then used a novel approach called sub-particle drift (SPD) to improve the dynamic model when the target made a dramatic move from one frame to the next. Finally, the propagation distances of each direction in the dynamic model were determined {{based on the results}} of motion estimation and SPD. Experimental results showed that the proposed method was robust for tracking objects with complex <b>dynamic</b> <b>movements</b> and in terms of affine transformation and occlusion. Compared to Continuously Adaptive Mean-Shift (CAM-Shift), standard particle filter (PF), Velocity-Adaptive Particle Filter (VAPF), and Memory-based Particle Filter (M-PF), the proposed tracker was superior for objects moving with large random velocities and accelerations.|$|R

40|$|RNA binding {{proteins}} may {{be important}} mediators of the activity-dependent transport of mRNAs to dendritic spines of activated synapses. We used fluorescence microscopy and digital imaging techniques applied to both fixed and live cultured hippocampal neurons to visualize the localization of the mRNA binding protein, zipcode binding protein 1 (ZBP 1), and its <b>dynamic</b> <b>movements</b> in response to KCl-induced depolarization at high spatial and temporal resolution. With the use of immunofluorescence, image deconvolution, and three-dimensional reconstruction, ZBP 1 was localized {{in the form of}} granules that were distributed in dendrites, spines, and subsynaptic sites. KCl depolarization increased the dendritic localization of ZBP 1 that was not attributed to an increase in ZBP 1 expression. Live cell imaging of single cells before and after perfusion of KCl revealed the rapid and directed efflux of ZBP 1 granules from the cell body into dendrites in a proximo-distal gradient. High-speed imaging of enhanced green fluorescence protein-ZBP 1 granules revealed rapid anterograde and retrograde movements in dendrites as well as <b>dynamic</b> <b>movements</b> in dendritic spines. A population of ZBP 1 granules colocalized with beta-actin mRNA, and their spatial association in dendrites was increased by KCl depolarization. The NMDA receptor antagonist AP- 5 impaired the dendritic localization of ZBP 1 and beta-actin mRNA and inhibited the KCl-induced transport of ZBP 1. The activity-dependent trafficking of ZBP 1 and its <b>dynamic</b> <b>movements</b> within dendritic spines provide new evidence to implicate RNA binding proteins as regulators of mRNA transport to activated synapses in response to synaptic activity...|$|R
