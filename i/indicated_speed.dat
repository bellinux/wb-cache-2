In this context, this paper proposes the use of clustering methods to characterize the traffic behavior in highway BR- 290 /RS, located in the metropolitan area of Porto Alegre - RS. The clustering techniques tested, K-means and fuzzy clustering (FCM), enabled the determination of behavioral patterns influenced by variables (flow, speed, accidents and rain).

50|$|Poorly {{maintained}} and overloaded transport and cargo vehicles frequently {{break down and}} cause accidents. Drivers often place branches or leaves in the road to indicate a broken down vehicle is in the roadway. Undisciplined drivers move unpredictably through traffic. Construction work is often poorly <b>indicated.</b> <b>Speed</b> bumps, commonly used on paved roads in and near villages, are seldom indicated. Drivers must be on guard against people and livestock wandering into or across the roads. Nighttime driving is particularly hazardous as vehicles frequently lack headlights and/or taillights, and brake lights are often burned out.With few exceptions, Cotonou and other cities lack any street lighting, and lighting on roads between population centers is non-existent. There have been numerous carjackings and robberies on roads in Benin after dark, several of which resulted in murder when the driver refused {{to comply with the}} assailants' demands. The National Police periodically conduct vehicle checks at provisional roadblocks in an effort to improve road safety and reduce the increasing number of carjackings.|$|E
5000|$|The M42 {{scheme was}} {{initially}} run {{as an experiment}} and a Highways Agency report into {{the first six months}} of the scheme showed a reduction in variability journey times of up to 27%. [...] The journey time statistics can be broken down to show that northbound journey times were reduced by 26%, equating to an average reduction of 4 minute as compared to the period when the variable speed limits were on but the hard shoulder was not being used and 9% southbound (equating to 1 minute) during the afternoon rush hour. The report also indicated a fall in the number of accidents from over 5 a month to 1.5 per month on average. The Agency did state that normally accident statistics should be compared over a 3-year period, so the initial results should be treated with caution. They also stated that no accidents had been caused by hard shoulder use as a normal lane. The report also stated that there had been a 10% fall in pollution and 4% fall in fuel consumption. [...] The report also indicated a compliance rate of 98% to the <b>indicated</b> <b>speed</b> limits when using the hard shoulder.

5000|$|Nine {{aircraft}} {{converted from}} B.IIIs. Fitted with Merlin 85/87 which had two-stage superchargers, giving much improved high altitude performance. The B VI could achieve a maximum speed of 313 mph (505 km/h) at 18,200 ft (5,550 m) at 65,000 lb (29,500 kg) takeoff weight and a service ceiling of 28,500 ft (8,690 m) {{at the same}} weight. Climb to 28,000 ft (8,500 m) at 65,000 lb (29,500 kg) takeoff weight was accomplished in 44.8 minutes with a maximum climb rate of 1,080 ft/min (5.5 m/s) at 1,000 ft (305 m). A Lancaster B VI was dived to a maximum <b>indicated</b> <b>speed</b> of 350 mph (565 km/h), or Mach 0.72 at 25,000 ft (7,620 m) in June 1944. The Merlin 85/87 series engines were fitted with annular cowlings similar to the Avro Lincoln and three bladed paddle-type propellers were fitted. These aircraft were only used by Pathfinder units; by No. 7 Squadron RAF, No. 83 Squadron RAF, No. 405 Squadron RCAF and by No. 635 Squadron RAF. Often used as a [...] "Master Bomber" [...] the B VI's were allocated to RAF Bomber Command apart from two that were retained by Rolls-Royce for installation and flight testing. Their dorsal and nose turrets were removed and faired-over. The more powerful engines proved troublesome in service and were disliked by ground maintenance staff for their rough running and propensity to 'surge and hunt', making synchronisation impossible. This was caused by variations in the fuel/air mixture and over time would damage the engine. The B VI was withdrawn from operational service in November 1944 and surviving aircraft were used by Rolls-Royce, the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the Bomb Ballistics Unit (BBU) for various testing and experimental duties.|$|E

40|$|Although a sound {{position}} {{without head}} movement localized, front-back confusion frequently occurs. Moreover, sound localization accuracy, especially front-back confusion, can be dramatically improved by listener head movement. This {{clearly shows that}} in sound localization both static cues involved in the sound signal input to the two ears and dynamic cues caused by listener motion are used. However, {{there have been few}} studies concerning spatial hearing dynamic situations. In this study, therefore, listener detection thresholds of movement of a sound stimulus during a sound localization task with head rotation were measured. Participants were first trained to rotate their heads at an <b>indicated</b> <b>speed.</b> Then during a sound localization trial, they were instructed to rotate their heads the direction of a sound stimulus at the speed. As a 2 AFC paradigm was used, in one of two successive trials, the sound position (azimuthal angle) slightly moved during the rotation. Participants were asked to judge in which trial the sound stimuli moved. Results revealed that detection thresholds were dynamically raised when participants rotated their heads. Moreover, this effect did not depend on the velocities. These findings may suggest that a process similar to saccadic suppression in vision exists in dynamic sound localization...|$|E
