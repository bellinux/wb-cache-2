40|$|In eukaryotes, {{the enzyme}} GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GDPMP) is {{essential}} for the formation of GDP-mannose, the central activated mannose donor in glycosylation reactions. Deletion of its gene is lethal in fungi, most likely as a consequence of disrupted glycoconjugate biosynthesis. Furthermore, absence <b>of</b> <b>GDPMP</b> enzyme activity and the expected loss of all mannose-containing glycoconjugates have so far not been observed in any eukaryotic organism. In this study we have cloned and characterized the gene encoding GDPMP from the eukaryotic protozoan parasite Leishmania mexicana. We report the generation <b>of</b> <b>GDPMP</b> gene deletion mutants of this human pathogen that are devoid <b>of</b> detectable <b>GDPMP</b> activity and completely lack mannose-containing glycoproteins and glycolipids, such as lipophosphoglycan, proteophosphoglycans, glycosylphosphatidylinositol protein membrane anchors, glycoinositolphos pholipids and N-glycans. The loss <b>of</b> <b>GDPMP</b> renders the parasites unable to infect macrophages or mice, while gene addback restores virulence. Our study demonstrates that GDP-mannose biosynthesis is not essential for Leishmania viability in culture, but constitutes a virulence pathway in these human pathogens...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{expected}} delay in cyclic polling models with general ‘branching-type’ service disciplines. For {{this class of}} models, which contains models with exhaustive and gated service as special cases, we obtain closed-form expressions for the expected delay under standard heavy-traffic scalings. We identify a single parameter associated with the service discipline at each queue, which we call the ‘exhaustiveness’. We show that the scaled expected delay figures depend on the service policies at the queues only through the <b>exhaustiveness</b> <b>of</b> each of the service disciplines. This implies that the influence of different service disciplines, but with the same exhaustiveness, on the expected delays at the queues becomes the same when the system reaches saturation. This observation leads to a new classification of the service disciplines. In addition, we show monotonicity of the scaled expected delays {{with respect to the}} <b>exhaustiveness</b> <b>of</b> the service disciplines. This induces a complete ordering in terms of efficiency of the service disciplines. The results also lead to new rules for optimization of the system performance with respect to the service disciplines at the queues. Further, the exact asymptotic results suggest simple expected waiting-time approximations for polling models in heavy traffic. Numerical experiments show that the accuracy of the approximations is excellent for practical heavy-traffic scenarios...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{design process}} of complex systems {{requires}} a precise checking of the functional and dependability {{attributes of the}} target design.

In the current paper, a general framework for an automated model transformation system is presented. The method starts from a uniform visual description and a formal proof concept of the particular transformations by integrating the powerful computational paradigm of graph transformation, planner algorithms of artificial intelligence, and various concepts of computer engineering...|$|R

Their conclusion is that people’s puzzlement cannot be dismissed as a product of confusion, for it stems from some fundamental aspects of their conception of the self. In this paper I suggest, contrary to their conclusion, that there is a sense in which the skeptical worries about responsibility elicited by the computer model of the mind do result from confusion. Those worries can be traced back to an irrational over-generalization concerning the scope of cognitive science and the alleged <b>exhaustiveness</b> <b>of</b> the range of facts formulated in its vocabulary. 1...|$|R
