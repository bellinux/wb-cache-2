40|$|Empirical {{analysis}} of the real convergence between old (<b>EU</b> 15) <b>and</b> new (<b>EU</b> 8) economies is the basic focus of this paper, which should importantly contribute to the extensive empirical literature. The basic motivation for the present analysis is mixed results regarding the convergence process between <b>EU</b> 8 <b>and</b> <b>EU</b> 15 obtained by different authors. Important contribution to the mixed results is provided by different methodological frameworks used. Therefore, we apply cross-section, panel data and time series framework and test for real convergence between the <b>EU</b> 8 <b>and</b> <b>EU</b> 15 economies. The obtained results indicate statistically significant negative relationship between average growth of labour productivity and initial value of labour productivity level. However, there is clear absence of systematic convergence between <b>EU</b> 8 <b>and</b> <b>EU</b> 15 economies. This implies that individual economies from the EU 23 group (i. e. EU 8 + EU 15) converge to its individual steady state, but both group of economies (<b>EU</b> 8 <b>and</b> <b>EU</b> 15) have different steady states. This result, however, provokes hypothesis that integration of former socialist economies (also termed as advanced transition economies) has not caused the convergence of these economies towards the productivity level of advanced market economies represented as EU 15. sustainability; convergence; EU integration; sustainable economy; economic growth; European Union. ...|$|R

5|$|Europium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol <b>Eu</b> <b>and</b> atomic number 63. It was isolated in 1901 and {{is named after}} the continent of Europe. It is a moderately hard, silvery metal which readily oxidizes in air and water. Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, europium usually assumes the oxidation state +3, but the oxidation state +2 is also common. All europium compounds with oxidation state +2 are slightly reducing. Europium has no significant biological role and is relatively non-toxic compared to other heavy metals. Most applications of europium exploit the phosphorescence of europium compounds. Europium {{is one of the}} least abundant elements in the universe; only about % of all matter in the universe is europium.|$|E

Neither Croatia nor the RSK liked the plan.
