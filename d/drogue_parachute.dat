5|$|Landing the {{aircraft}} required {{the extension of}} the retractable landing skid and the deployment of a braking <b>drogue</b> <b>parachute.</b> As pilots could access the plane only from a hatch above the cockpit, the pilot would have to enter the E.381 before it could be attached to the carrier Ar 234C and had no way to escape in case of an emergency, while attached to the carrier.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} SRE-1 descended to an {{altitude}} of 5km, aerodynamic braking had considerably reduced its velocity to 101m/s (364km/h). Pilot and <b>drogue</b> <b>parachute</b> deployments helped in further reducing its velocity to 47m/s (169km/h).|$|E
25|$|The Tu-124 {{retained}} a <b>drogue</b> <b>parachute</b> {{to be used}} in an emergency landing or landing on a slippery surface and had low pressure tires to aid operation from unpaved airfields. As on the Tu-104 the engines were integrated into the wings, but the turbofan engines were more fuel efficient. The placement of the engines amplified vibrations, which affected the comfort of the passenger cabin, and also the fatigue lifetime of the wing assembly.|$|E
50|$|Four {{methods are}} used to {{decelerate}} the vehicle. It has high-speed air brakes which were original equipment on the F-104; high-speed <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> deployed at 700 mph; and low-speed <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> deployed once the speed drops to below 350 mph. The vehicle also has an Anti-skid neodymium rare-earth magnet eddy-current brake.|$|R
40|$|At higher altitudes, {{prior to}} the {{deployment}} of the main parachutes, the Orion spacecraft descent to Earth will rely on deceleration by <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes.</b> These parachutes have a ribbon construction, and in fluid–structure interaction (FSI) modeling this creates geometric and flow complexities comparable to those encountered in FSI modeling of the main parachutes, which have a ringsail construction. The <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> {{to be used with}} the Orion spacecraft have 24 gores, with 52 ribbons in each gore, resulting in hundreds of gaps that the flow goes through. We address this computational challenge, as was done for the main parachutes, with the Homogenized Modeling of Geometric Porosity (HMGP). Like the main <b>parachutes,</b> the <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> will be used in multiple stages, starting with a "reefed" stage where a cable along the parachute skirt constrains the diameter to be less than the diameter in the subsequent stage. After {{a certain period of time}} during the descent, the cable is cut and the parachute "disreefs" (i. e. expands) to the next stage. Computing the parachute shape at the reefed stage and FSI modeling during the disreefing involve computational challenges beyond those in FSI modeling of fully-open <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes.</b> Orion spacecraft <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> will have three stages, with FSI modeling of disreefing from Stage 1 to Stage 2 being somewhat more challenging than disreefing from Stage 2 to Stage 3. We present the special modeling techniques we devised to address the computational challenges and the results from the computations carried out. We also present the methods we devised to calculate for a parachute gore the radius of curvature in the circumferential direction. The curvature values are intended for quick and simple engineering analysis in estimating the structural stresses. The flight envelope of the Orion <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> includes regions where the Mach number is high enough to require a compressible-flow solver. We present some preliminary computations for such cases...|$|R
50|$|<b>Drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> {{may also}} be used to help {{stabilise}} direction of something in flight, such as a thrown RKG-3 anti-tank grenade.It is often used to gain control of very fast descents, including those of spacecraft during atmospheric reentry or nuclear bombs such as the B61 and B83. Some escape capsules used by supersonic aircraft deploy <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> to stabilise and slow down, allowing either a main chute to be deployed or the pilot to exit the capsule and use a personal chute.|$|R
25|$|During {{the early}} part of 1965 about one dozen {{personnel}} of the 109th Quartermaster Corps, U.S. Army, were sent TDY to Eglin Air Force Base, where they assisted Air Force personnel developing an air delivery technique called the low-altitude parachute extraction system (LAPES). The 109th's mission was to provide parachute packing, temporary storage and rigging of supplies and equipment for aerial drop by aircraft of all the services. In addition, the 109th was to render technical assistance in the recovery and evacuation of airdrop equipment. Using the LAPES system, while a cargo plane flew a few feet above ground level, a <b>drogue</b> <b>parachute</b> would be released, pulling palletized cargo out of the aircraft and onto the drop zone. An alternative method was the ground proximity extraction system (GPES), in which cargo was yanked from the aircraft by a hook that snagged a cable traversing the runway. At full strength the unit would be capable of preparing 200 tons of material per day for delivery by free, high velocity or low-velocity drop techniques.|$|E
500|$|In 1988, a {{piece of}} {{parachute}} material was raised from the river bottom near Tina Bar, but FBI experts determined that it {{had come from a}} military <b>drogue</b> <b>parachute.</b> In 2008, children unearthed another parachute near Amboy, Washington, about [...] due south of Lake Merwin, which proved to be of World War II-era military origin. The Columbia River ransom money and the airstair instruction placard remain the only bona fide physical evidence from the hijacking ever found outside the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Kearsarge {{picked up}} the capsule on radar while still [...] from landing; [...] further up the landing path, the {{destroyer}} [...] reported a sonic boom as it passed overhead. At , Schirra deployed the <b>drogue</b> <b>parachute,</b> and then the main parachute at [...] The landing was surprisingly precise, [...] from the target point and [...] from Kearsarge, and Schirra joked {{that he was on}} course for the recovery carrier's [...] "number three elevator". The capsule hit the water, sank and bobbed to the surface again, righting itself after about 30seconds. Three pararescue swimmers were dropped by one of the helicopters to help him climb out, but Schirra radioed that he would prefer to be towed to the carrier, and a whaleboat from Kearsarge was sent with a line.|$|E
40|$|During descent after {{re-entry}} {{into the}} Earth's atmosphere, the Orion CM deploys its <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> at approximately Mach 0. 7. Accurately predicting the dynamic pressure {{experienced by the}} <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> at deployment is critical to properly designing the parachutes. This NASA Engineering and Safety Center assessment was {{designed to provide a}} complete set of flowfield measurements on and around an idealized Orion Crew Module shape with the most appropriate wind tunnel simulation of the Orion flight conditions prior to parachute deployment. This document contains the details of testing and the outcome of the assessment...|$|R
50|$|The Air Force {{selected}} the swept-wing F-84F Thunderstreak as their second aircraft in 1955, modified {{for the team}} by adding smoke tanks, and red, white and blue <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes.</b> Used from 1955-1956.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: F-16A #672 {{carrying}} four AIM-120 AMRAAMs and two AIM-9 Sidewinders. The Norwegian F-16s {{were the}} first to be equipped with <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> (located in the rectangular extension {{at the base of the}} tail fin).|$|R
500|$|The first design, the Mark I, had a {{fuselage}} with {{a circular}} cross-section {{and a small}} round window in the nose for pilot vision. A [...] armored shell protected most of the fuselage. The pilot {{would have been in}} a prone position in the very cramped cockpit (the cross-section was , or approximately a quarter of the cross-section of the Messerschmitt Bf 109.) behind a removable [...] bullet-resistant glass screen mounted in front of the pilot. Two small bulges were located {{on the sides of the}} fuselage for the pilot's elbows. Three C-Stoff tanks surrounded the pilot, with the T-Stoff oxidizer tank in the center section between the pilot and the engine. The aircraft had straight wings, mounted at the top of the aircraft. In the dorsal area (at the wing mounts), the fuselage humped to accommodate a [...] blister for a single MK 108 [...] cannon and 60 (other writers say 45) rounds. The Walter HWK 109-509A single-chamber rocket engine was mounted beneath the aft fuselage, which also carried a twin-fin empennage and the <b>drogue</b> <b>parachute</b> housing.|$|E
500|$|The E.381 {{began in}} a {{proposal}} from Arado Flugzeugwerke to the Air Ministry for a parasite fighter, carried underneath another aircraft, to destroy Allied bombers. Three variants of the E.381, named Mark I, II and III, were designed. Each version was essentially an armored tube provided with armament and a Walter HWK 109-509 rocket engine for power. The aircraft would have carried enough fuel for two approaches to the target as well as only sixty (some say forty-five) [...] rounds. After using all his fuel during an attack it was intended that the pilot would glide the fighter to the ground, deploy its <b>drogue</b> <b>parachute,</b> and land the aircraft on a primitive skid landing gear. [...] None of the designs were ever completed due to its cancellation, though some wooden airframes and a single mockup were constructed in 1944 to provide prone-position training for pilots. The E.381 was cancelled {{due to a lack}} of funds and interest by the Ministry of Aviation, along with a scarcity of mother Ar 234 aircraft — the Arado Ar 234C four-BMW 003 jet engined aircraft intended for this purpose was never able to be flight tested before the war's end.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plane had}} very unusual takeoff requirements, with a 14° {{angle of attack}} needed for the {{rotation}} at about [...] for a 150,000 pound combat weight. This poor takeoff performance was also evident with the high landing speed that necessitated a <b>drogue</b> <b>parachute</b> for braking.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} had {{an estimated}} lift-to-drag ratio of 37. [...] The aerodynamic drag {{is so low}} that, even with the engine idling, the aircraft can only descend at a maximum of 700 ft/min m/s. Twin <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> were used to slow the GlobalFlyer to landing speeds.|$|R
50|$|GBU-43s are {{delivered}} from C-130 cargo planes, inside {{which they are}} carried on cradles resting on airdrop platforms. The bombs are dropped by deploying <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes,</b> which also extract the cradle and platform from the aircraft. Shortly after launch, the drogues are released and bombs fall unretarded. GPS satellite-guidance is used to guide bombs to their targets.|$|R
40|$|A wind-tunnel {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the parameters affecting the aerodynamic performance of <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> in the Mach number range from 1. 6 to 3. Flow studies of both rigid and flexible-parachute models were made by means of high-speed schlieren motion pictures and drag coefficients of the flexible-parachute models were measured at simulated altitudes from about 50, 000 to 120, 000 feet...|$|R
2500|$|The launch {{took place}} at the south rim of the Snake River Canyon, west of Shoshone Falls (...) , on Sunday, September 8, 1974, at 3:36p.m. MDT. The steam that powered the engine was {{superheated}} to a temperature of [...] The <b>drogue</b> <b>parachute</b> prematurely deployed as the Skycycle left the launching rail and induced significant drag. Even though the craft made it {{all the way across the}} canyon to the north rim, the prevailing northwest winds caused it to drift back into the canyon. By the time it hit the bottom of the canyon, it landed only a few feet from the water on the same side of the canyon from which it had been launched. If he had landed in the water, Knievel likely would have drowned, due to a jumpsuit/harness malfunction which kept him strapped in the vehicle. He survived the jump with only minor injuries.|$|E
2500|$|After reentry, a small, <b>drogue</b> <b>parachute</b> (H) was {{deployed}} at [...] for {{stabilizing the}} spacecraft's descent. The main parachute (I) was deployed at [...] {{starting with a}} narrow opening that opened fully {{in a few seconds}} to lessen the strain on the lines. Just before hitting the water, the landing bag inflated from behind the heat shield to reduce the force of impact (J). Upon landing the parachutes were released. An antenna (K) was raised and sent out signals that could be traced by ships and helicopters. Further, a green marker dye was spread around the spacecraft to make its location more visible from the air. Frogmen brought in by helicopters inflated a collar around the craft to keep it upright in the water. The recovery helicopter hooked onto the spacecraft and the astronaut blew the escape hatch to exit the capsule. He was then hoisted aboard the helicopter that finally brought both him and the spacecraft to the ship.|$|E

50|$|Formerly, {{the main}} chutes were {{released}} from the SRB at impact using a parachute release nut ordnance system (residual loads in the main chutes would deploy the parachute attach fittings with floats tethered to each fitting). The current design keeps the main chutes attached during water impact (initial impact and slapdown). Salt Water Activated Release (SWAR) devices are now incorporated into the main chute riser lines to simplify recovery efforts and reduce damage to the SRB. The <b>drogue</b> deployment bag/pilot <b>parachutes,</b> <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> and frustums, each main chute, and the SRBs are buoyant and are recovered.|$|R
40|$|DTV-SIM is a {{computer}} program that implements a mathematical model of the flight dynamics of a missile-shaped drop test vehicle (DTV) equipped with a multistage parachute system that includes two simultaneously deployed <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> and three main parachutes deployed subsequently and simultaneously by use of pilot parachutes. DTV-SIM was written to support air-drop tests of the DTV/parachute system, which serves a simplified prototype of a proposed crew capsule/parachute landing system...|$|R
5000|$|A forward skirt extension, which housed new, larger parachutes.

50|$|A <b>drogue</b> <b>parachute</b> is more {{elongated}} {{and has a}} {{far smaller}} area than a conventional parachute and therefore provides less drag. This means that a <b>drogue</b> <b>parachute</b> cannot slow an object {{as much as a}} conventional parachute, but it can be deployed at speeds at which conventional parachutes would be torn apart.|$|E
50|$|The {{components}} of the ELS were housed around the forward docking tunnel. The forward compartment was separated from the central by a bulkhead and was divided into four 90-degree wedges. The ELS consisted of two <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> with mortars, three main parachutes, three pilot parachutes to deploy the mains, three inflation bags for uprighting the capsule if necessary, a sea recovery cable, a dye marker, and a swimmer umbilical.|$|R
25|$|A steel rod, {{known as}} the drogue gun, is fired and {{extracts}} two small <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> to stabilise the seat's descent path.

50|$|Although one of {{the pilot}} {{parachute}} steel cable risers was kinked, the Earth landing system functioned properly. The <b>drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> inflated and stabilized the command module for pilot and main parachute deployment, {{and the rate of}} descent while on the main parachutes was satisfactory. The maximum altitude achieved was 9258 ft above mean sea level, approximately 650 ft higher than predicted. The command module landed about 7600 ft from the launch site, some 2000 ft farther than planned.|$|R

50|$|The T-4 had intake ramps {{similar to}} the XB-70, was made largely from {{titanium}} and stainless steel, and featured a quadruple redundant fly-by-wire control system but also employed a mechanical system as a backup. The aircraft's Droop-nose lowered to provide visibility during takeoff and landing. A periscope was used for forward viewing when the nose was retracted, and could be employed at speeds of up to 600 km/h (373 mph). <b>Drogue</b> <b>parachutes</b> were used in addition to conventional wheel brakes.|$|R
