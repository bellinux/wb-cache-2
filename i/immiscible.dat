5|$|A {{compound}} that has two <b>immiscible</b> hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts {{within the same}} molecule is called an amphiphilic molecule. Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.|$|E
5|$|Impurities {{are mostly}} arsenic, antimony, bismuth, zinc, copper, silver, and gold. The melt is {{treated in a}} reverberatory furnace with air, steam, and sulfur, which oxidizes the {{impurities}} except for silver, gold, and bismuth. Oxidized contaminants float {{to the top of}} the melt and are skimmed off. Metallic silver and gold are removed and recovered economically by means of the Parkes process, in which zinc is added to lead. The zinc dissolves silver and gold, both of which, being <b>immiscible</b> in lead, can be separated and retrieved. De-silvered lead is freed of bismuth by the Betterton–Kroll process, treating it with metallic calcium and magnesium. The resulting bismuth dross can be skimmed off.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{consists}} of a waxy colloidal emulsion, a substance composed {{of a number of}} partially <b>immiscible</b> liquids and solids mixed together. It is usually made from ingredients including some or all of naphtha, lanolin, turpentine, wax (often Carnauba wax), gum arabic, ethylene glycol, and if required a colourant, such as carbon black or an azo dye (such as aniline yellow). It typically has a specific gravity of 0.8, is negligibly soluble in water, and is made of between 65 and 77% volatile substances—usually naphtha. The high amount of volatile substances means that the shoe polish will dry out and harden after application, while retaining its shine.|$|E
25|$|As many {{as eight}} <b>immiscible</b> liquid phases have been observed. Mutually <b>immiscible</b> liquid phases are formed from water (aqueous phase), {{hydrophobic}} organic solvents, perfluorocarbons (fluorous phase), silicones, several different metals, and also from molten phosphorus. Not all organic solvents are completely miscible, e.g. a mixture of ethylene glycol and toluene may separate into two distinct organic phases.|$|E
25|$|Phases do {{not need}} to macroscopically {{separate}} spontaneously. Emulsions and colloids are examples of <b>immiscible</b> phase pair combinations that do not physically separate.|$|E
25|$|When mischmetal, an alloy of {{lanthanide}} metals, {{is added}} to molten steel to remove oxygen and sulfur, stable oxysulfides are produced that form an <b>immiscible</b> solid.|$|E
25|$|Kambalda-type ore {{deposits}} are distinctive in {{that the}} deposition of an <b>immiscible</b> Fe-Ni-Cu sulfide melt occurs within a lava flow channel upon the palaeosurface. This is distinct from other magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE deposits, where Fe-Ni-Cu sulfide melt accumulates within a subvolcanic feeder dike, sill, or magma chamber.|$|E
25|$|Liquids {{can display}} immiscibility. The most {{familiar}} mixture of two <b>immiscible</b> liquids {{in everyday life}} is the vegetable oil and water in Italian salad dressing. A familiar set of miscible liquids is water and alcohol. Liquid components in a mixture can often be separated from one another via fractional distillation.|$|E
25|$|Magma {{composition}} can {{be determined}} by processes other than partial melting and fractional crystallization. For instance, magmas commonly interact with rocks they intrude, both by melting those rocks and by reacting with them. Magmas of different compositions can mix with one another. In rare cases, melts can separate into two <b>immiscible</b> melts of contrasting compositions.|$|E
25|$|One {{chemical}} {{process has been}} demonstrated to pilot plant stage but not used for production. The French CHEMEX process exploited a very slight difference in the two isotopes' propensity to change valency in oxidation/reduction, utilising <b>immiscible</b> aqueous and organic phases. An ion-exchange process {{was developed by the}} Asahi Chemical Company in Japan that applies similar chemistry but effects separation on a proprietary resin ion-exchange column.|$|E
25|$|Chromatography {{is based}} on the concept of {{partition}} coefficient. Any solute partitions between two <b>immiscible</b> solvents. When we make one solvent immobile (by adsorption on a solid support matrix) and another mobile it results in most common applications of chromatography. If the matrix support, or stationary phase, is polar (e.g. paper, silica etc.) it is forward phase chromatography, and if it is non-polar (C-18) it is reverse phase.|$|E
25|$|A {{variant of}} the diamond anvil, the {{hydrothermal}} diamond anvil cell (HDAC) is used in experimental petrology/geochemistry {{for the study of}} aqueous fluids, silicate melts, <b>immiscible</b> liquids, mineral solubility and aqueous fluid speciation at geologic pressures and temperatures. The HDAC is sometimes used to examine aqueous complexes in solution using the synchrotron light source techniques XANES and EXAFS. The design of HDAC is very similar to that of DAC, but it is optimized for studying liquids.|$|E
25|$|Egg {{emulsion}} sauces include mayonnaise, Hollandaise and Béarnaise. For hollandaise sauce, {{egg yolks}} and water, lemon juice or vinegar are emulsified. Unlike custard, the egg does not coagulate. An emulsion {{is a mixture}} of two or more liquids that are normally <b>immiscible</b> (unmixable or unblendable). Droplets of the butter become suspended in the water and lemon juice once emulsion occurs. While emulsions can be either stable or unstable, hollandaise is made stable by the addition of eggs which contain lecithin, combining with the oil and water, holding it together.|$|E
25|$|<b>Immiscible</b> liquids, such {{as water}} and toluene, easily form azeotropes. Commonly, these azeotropes are {{referred}} to as a low boiling azeotrope because the boiling point of the azeotrope is lower than the boiling point of either pure component. The temperature and composition of the azeotrope is easily predicted from the vapor pressure of the pure components, without use of Raoult's law. The azeotrope is easily broken in a distillation set-up by using a liquid–liquid separator (a decanter) to separate the two liquid layers that are condensed overhead. Only one of the two liquid layers is refluxed to the distillation set-up.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{the natural}} gas which was {{recovered}} {{in the course of}} recovering petroleum could not be profitably sold, and was simply burned at the oil field in a process known as flaring. Flaring is now illegal in many countries. Additionally, higher demand in the last 20–30 years has made production of gas associated with oil economically viable. As a further option, the gas is now sometimes re-ed into the formation for enhanced oil recovery by pressure maintenance as well as miscible or <b>immiscible</b> flooding. Conservation, re-injection, or flaring of natural gas associated with oil is primarily dependent on proximity to markets (pipelines), and regulatory restrictions.|$|E
25|$|The {{operating}} principle of CCC equipment requires a column consisting {{of an open}} tube coiled around a bobbin. The bobbin is rotated in a double-axis gyratory motion (a cardioid), which causes a variable gravity (G) field {{to act on the}} column during each rotation. This motion causes the column to see one partitioning step per revolution and components of the sample separate in the column due to their partitioning coefficient between the two <b>immiscible</b> liquid phases used. There are many types of CCC available today. These include HSCCC (High Speed CCC) and HPCCC (High Performance CCC). HPCCC is the latest and best performing version of the instrumentation available currently.|$|E
25|$|Many metal {{silicides}} are known, most {{of which}} have formulae that cannot be explained through simple appeals to valence: their bonding ranges from metallic to ionic and covalent. Some known stoichiometries are M6Si, M5Si, M4Si, M15Si4, M3Si, M5Si2, M2Si, M5Si3, M3Si2, MSi, M2Si3, MSi2, MSi3, and MSi6. They are structurally more similar to the borides than the carbides, {{in keeping with the}} diagonal relationship between boron and silicon, although the larger size of silicon than boron means that exact structural analogies are few and far between. The heats of formation of the silicides are usually {{similar to those of the}} borides and carbides of the same elements, but they usually melt at lower temperatures. Silicides are known for all stable elements in groups 1–10, with the exception of beryllium: in particular, uranium and the transition metals of groups 4–10 show the widest range of stoichiometries. Except for copper, the metals in groups 11–15 do not form silicides. Most instead form eutectic mixtures, although the heaviest post-transition metals mercury, thallium, lead, and bismuth are completely <b>immiscible</b> with liquid silicon.|$|E

Subsequently, this predicts the contact angle of a liquid droplet on a solid surface from knowledge of the three surface energies involved. This equation also applies if the [...] "gas" [...] phase is another liquid, <b>immiscible</b> with the droplet of the first [...] "liquid" [...] phase.|$|E
500|$|Liquid helium-4 can be cooled {{to about}} 1 kelvin using {{evaporative}} cooling in a 1-K pot. Similar cooling of helium-3, {{which has a}} lower boiling point, can achieve about [...] in a helium-3 refrigerator. Equal mixtures of liquid [...] and [...] below [...] separate into two <b>immiscible</b> phases due to their dissimilarity (they follow different quantum statistics: helium-4 atoms are bosons while helium-3 atoms are fermions). Dilution refrigerators use this immiscibility to achieve temperatures of a few millikelvins.|$|E
500|$|Ali's longstanding finale was the {{swallowing}} of copious {{amounts of}} water again, but this time followed by a pint of kerosene. A prop was then produced, typically a model castle or house made of metal set on a table, within which a small flame burned. Lighter than water and <b>immiscible</b> with it, the kerosene floated above the liquid in Ali's gut, allowing him to disgorge it first. The stage thus set, and to a drum roll or an imitation of fire bells, Ali became a [...] "human flamethrower", spewing the accelerant in a long stream over the sacrificial prop, setting it ablaze. Once the kerosene was exhausted, the water followed, streaming out his mouth in a long flow from up to six feet away, extinguishing the fire.|$|E
2500|$|These {{functions}} are achieved if the slag {{has a low}} melting temperature, low density and high viscosity which ensure a liquid slag that separates well from the melting metal. Slag should also maintain its correct composition {{so that it can}} collect more impurities and be <b>immiscible</b> in the melt.|$|E
2500|$|Iron oxide lavas {{are thought}} to be the source of the iron ore at Kiruna, Sweden which formed during the Proterozoic. Iron oxide lavas of Pliocene age occur at the El Laco {{volcanic}} complex on the Chile-Argentina border. Iron oxide lavas {{are thought to}} be the result of <b>immiscible</b> separation of iron oxide magma from a parental magma of calc-alkaline or alkaline composition.|$|E
2500|$|Sagan also {{commented on}} Christianity and the Jefferson Bible, stating [...] "My long-time view about Christianity {{is that it}} {{represents}} an amalgam of two seemingly <b>immiscible</b> parts, the religion of Jesus and the religion of Paul. Thomas Jefferson attempted to excise the Pauline parts of the New Testament. There wasn't much left when he was done, {{but it was an}} inspiring document." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{physical}} sciences, a partition-coefficient (P) or distribution-coefficient (D) [...] is {{the ratio of}} concentrations of a compound {{in a mixture of}} two <b>immiscible</b> phases at equilibrium. This ratio is therefore a measure of the difference in solubility of the compound in these two phases. [...] The partition-coefficient generally refers to the concentration ratio of un-ionized species of compound whereas the distribution-coefficient refers to the concentration ratio of all species of the compound (ionized plus un-ionized).|$|E
2500|$|When a {{solution}} of a substance in one solvent is brought into equilibrium with a second solvent that is <b>immiscible</b> with the first solvent, the dissolved substance may be partitioned between the two solvents. The ratio of concentrations in the two solvents {{is known as a}} partition coefficient or distribution coefficient. The partition coefficient is defined as the ratio of the analytical concentrations of the solute in the two phases. By convention the value is reported in logarithmic form.|$|E
2500|$|Polarized liquid {{interfaces}} {{have been}} used to examine the thermodynamics and kinetics of the transfer of charged species from one phase to another. Two main methods exist. [...] The first is ITIES, Interfaces between two <b>immiscible</b> electrolyte solutions. The second is droplet experiments. Here a reaction at a triple interface between a conductive solid, droplets of a redox active liquid phase and an electrolyte solution {{have been used}} to determine the energy required to transfer a charged species across the interface.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{influences}} at {{the interface}} may cause {{changes in the}} composition of the near-surface layer [...] Substances may either accumulate near the surface or, conversely, move into the bulk. [...] The movement of the molecules characterizes the phenomena of adsorption. [...] Adsorption influences changes in surface tension and colloid stability. [...] Adsorption layers at the surface of a liquid dispersion medium may affect the interactions of the dispersed particles in the media and consequently these layers may play crucial role in colloid stability The adsorption of molecules of liquid phase at an interface occurs when this liquid phase is in contact with other <b>immiscible</b> phases that may be gas, liquid, or solid ...|$|E
2500|$|Liquid {{chromatography}} is {{a method}} of physical separation in which the components of a liquid mixture are distributed between two <b>immiscible</b> phases, i.e., stationary and mobile. The practice of LC {{can be divided into}} five categories, i.e., adsorption chromatography, partition chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, size-exclusion chromatography, and affinity chromatography. Among these, the most widely used variant is the reverse-phase (RP) mode of the partition chromatography technique, which makes use of a non-polar (hydrophobic) stationary phase and a polar mobile phase. [...] In common applications, the mobile phase is a mixture of water and other polar solvents (e.g., methanol, isopropanol, and acetonitrile), and the stationary matrix is prepared by attaching long-chain alkyl groups (e.g., n-octadecyl or C18) to the surface of [...] irregularly or spherically shaped 5 μm diameter silica particles.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{phase is}} {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} synonym for state of matter, but there can be several <b>immiscible</b> phases of the same state of matter. Also, the term phase is sometimes {{used to refer to}} a set of equilibrium states demarcated in terms of state variables such as pressure and temperature by a phase boundary on a phase diagram. Because phase boundaries relate to changes in the organization of matter, such as a change from liquid to solid or a more subtle change from one crystal structure to another, this latter usage is similar to the use of [...] "phase" [...] as a synonym for state of matter. However, the state of matter and phase diagram usages are not [...] with the formal definition given above and the intended meaning must be determined in part from {{the context in which the}} term is used.|$|E
2500|$|Johann Stichlmair {{developed}} electroextraction at the University of Essen in Germany in 1987 as {{an improvement}} on liquid-liquid extraction in an electric field. [...] Electric fields {{are applied to}} enhance the demixing of a sample in a two-phase system. [...] However, as current flows through the system, the resulting convective mixing disrupts separation. [...] Electroextraction corrects for this. [...] Two or three liquid phases that are electrically conductive and <b>immiscible</b> with one another are kept between electrodes, and upon addition of an electric field, charged particles travel from one phase to another separating anions and cations. [...] A two-phase system brings anions into one phase and cations into the other. [...] A three phase system extracts anions and cations into the two outer phases while leaving uncharged particles in the middle phase. [...] Convective mixing is restricted to each phase and does not travel between phases. [...] A diagram is given in figure 1. [...] Organic phases that are used typically have small amounts of water added {{in order to be}} conductive. [...] Other possible phases include mixtures of water and highly polymerized substances, or water with non-ionic surfactants. [...] Electroextraction has also influenced the development of similar electrophoretic separation techniques involving a membrane between the two-phase systems.|$|E
6000|$|... 552. The theory I have {{advanced}} accords {{in a most}} satisfactory manner with the fact of an element or substance finding its place of rest, or rather of evolution, sometimes at one pole and sometimes at the other. Sulphur illustrates this effect very well[A]. When sulphuric acid is decomposed by the pile, sulphur is evolved at the negative pole; but when sulphuret of silver is decomposed {{in a similar way}} (436.), then the sulphur appears at the positive pole; and if a hot platina pole be used so as to vaporize the sulphur evolved in the latter case, then the relation of that pole to the sulphur is exactly the same as the relation of the same pole to oxygen upon its immersion in water. In both cases the element evolved is liberated at the pole, but not retained by it; but by virtue of its elastic, uncombinable, and <b>immiscible</b> condition passes away into the surrounding medium. The sulphur is evidently determined in these opposite directions by its opposite chemical relations to oxygen and silver; and it is to such relations generally that I have referred all electro-chemical phenomena. Where they do not exist, no electro-chemical action can take place. Where they are strongest, it is most powerful; where they are reversed, the direction of transfer of the substance is reversed with them.|$|E
6000|$|... 801. The {{ordinary}} protoxide of antimony, {{which consists}} of one proportional of metal and {{one and a half}} of oxygen, was subjected to the action of the electric current in a green-glass tube (789.), surrounded by a jacket of platina foil, and heated in a charcoal fire. The decomposition began and proceeded very well at first, apparently indicating, according to the general law (679. 697.), that this substance was one containing such elements and in such proportions as made it amenable {{to the power of the}} electric current. This effect I have already given reasons for supposing may be due to the presence of a true protoxide, consisting of single proportionals (696. 693.). The action soon diminished, and finally ceased, because of the formation of a higher oxide of the metal at the positive electrode. This compound, which was probably the peroxide, being infusible and insoluble in the protoxide, formed a crystalline crust around the positive electrode; and thus insulating it, prevented the transmission of the electricity. Whether, if it had been fusible and still <b>immiscible,</b> it would have decomposed, is doubtful, because of its departure from the required composition (697.). It was a very natural secondary product at the positive electrode (779.). On opening the tube it was found that a little antimony had been separated at the negative electrode; but the quantity was too small to allow of any quantitative result being obtained[A].|$|E
50|$|It is {{a common}} {{observation}} that when oil and water are poured into the same container, they separate into two phases or layers, because they are <b>immiscible.</b> In general, aqueous (or water-based) solutions, being polar, are <b>immiscible</b> with non-polar organic solvents (chloroform, toluene, hexane etc.) and form a two-phase system. However, in an ABS, both <b>immiscible</b> components are water-based.|$|E
50|$|A multiphasic {{liquid is}} a mixture {{consisting}} {{of more than two}} <b>immiscible</b> liquid phases. Biphasic mixtures consisting of two <b>immiscible</b> phases are very common and usually consist of an organic solvent and an aqueous phase ("oil and water").|$|E
