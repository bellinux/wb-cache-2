40|$|RESUME This work is {{concentrated}} on issue of purchase of medical practices {{which in this}} market period gains the importence. Even though today there is bigger and bigger demand for this transaction, legislation is not very well adapted to that. Medical practice can be perceived as undertaking pursuant to § 502 civil code. Because of that, {{it is possible to}} sell it (besides other ways) based on legal title business <b>purchase</b> <b>contract</b> pursuant to § 2175 civil code. Legal title business <b>purchase</b> <b>contract</b> is in practice used often, nevertheless whole process of purchase of medical practice based on legal title business <b>purchase</b> <b>contract</b> is not smooth. I would like to highlight the problems which can emerge. It is possible to divide this work into two parts. The first part deals with legal definitions and legal analysis of basic legal terms as undertaking, medical practice, provider of medical assistance services. We can find here also justification why it is possible to perceive medical practice as undertaking. The second part is focused on business <b>purchase</b> <b>contract</b> in general with specifics, which can arise in case of purchase of medical practice based on legal title business <b>purchase</b> <b>contract.</b> In second chapter (after the introduction), I define in general the concept of undertaking and I also [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of outside <b>purchase</b> <b>contracts</b> on firm risk and firm capital structure. We find that firms with more outside <b>purchase</b> <b>contracts</b> have less risky firm cash flows. Despite these less risky cash flows, our results show that these firms use less {{financial}} leverage reducing their risk of financial distress. We show that the effect of outside contracts on financial leverage is more negative when firms operate in high value-added industries. Examining firm financing decisions, we document that firms with more outside contracts are more likely to issue private securities. Our results are consistent with firms with more outside <b>purchase</b> <b>contracts</b> using less leverage to decrease the expected costs of financial distress on the firm’s implicit and explicit contracting parties...|$|R

As far as the customer foreclosure risks arising from single branding are concerned, it comes to the conclusion that Regulation 2790 / 1999 wrongly focuses on the market share of the seller and should concentrate on the market share of the acquirer. Symetrically, in so far as the input foreclosure risks arising from <b>exclusive</b> <b>purchasing</b> are concerned, Regulation 2790 / 1999 should focus on the market share of the seller.
