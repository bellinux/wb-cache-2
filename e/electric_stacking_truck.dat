As I stated in my May 18, 2000, letter to Mr. Tom Green of GE (Reference 1), the staff believes that the hydrodynamic mass coefficient, Cm, value used in strainer designs is important for postulated loss of main condenser and large-break loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) events, particularly with regard to demonstrating appropriate safety margins relating to containment penetration integrity following such blowdown events.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new power {{harvesting}} application is developed and simulated. Power harvesting is chosen within the European Clean Sky {{project as a}} solution to powering in-blade health monitoring systems as opposed to installing an elaborate electrical infrastructure to draw power from and transmit signals to the helicopter body. Local generation of power will allow for a ‘plug and play’ rotor blade and signals may be logged or transmitted wirelessly. The lag damper is chosen to be modified as it provides a well defined loading due to the re-gressive damping characteristic. A piezo <b>electric</b> <b>stack</b> is installed inside the damper rod, effec-tively coupled in series with the damper. Due to the well defined peak force generated in the damper the stack geometry requires a very limited margin of safety. Typically the stack geometry must be chosen to prevent excessive voltage build-up as opposed to mechanical overload. Development and simulation of the model is described starting with a simplified blade and piezo element model. Presuming specific flight conditions transient simulations are conducted using various power harvesting circuits and their performance is evaluated. The best performing circuit is further optimized to increase the specific power output. Optimization of the electrical and mechanical domains must be done simultaneously due to the high electro-mechanical cou-pling of the piezo stack. The non-linear electrical properties of the piezo material, most notably the capacitance which may have a large influence, are not yet considered in this study. The power harvesting lag damper provides sufficient power for extensive health monitoring systems within the blade while retaining the functionality and safety of the standard component. For the 8. 15 m blade radius and 130 knots flight speed under consideration simulations show 7. 5 watts of power is generated from a single damper...|$|R

In order to take the better advantage from the analysis of the on-site operation, and especially to correctly design the scheduled experimental tests on the system, we developed a mathematical model and run a simulated experimental campaign, applying a rigorous statistical approach to the analysis of the results. The aim of thiswork is the computer experimental analysis, through a statistical methodology (2 k factorial experiments), of the CHP 100 performance. First, the mathematical model has been calibrated with the results acquired during the first CHP 100 demonstration at EDB/ELSAM inWesterwoort.

By comparing two different parameter levels i. e. low and high numbers of populations the optimum solution is obtained considering a high level population size.

40|$|Currently the {{lifespan}} of helicopter {{rotor blades}} is determined {{based on a}} conservative lifetime calculation. This leads to blades being discarded while they still possess a significant residual amount of flighthours. Blade health monitoring systems are desired to actively track the strains in the blade {{as a means to}} determine the residual life of the blade, significantly extending the technical life expectancy. A major drawback is the need for an electrical infrastructure to transmit all the signals to and from the rotor hub to the aircraft body. It would be advantageous if the required power could be generated locally. Within the European Clean Sky project vibrationbased power harvesting is chosen as a solution to powering in-blade health monitoring systems. In this paper simulations of a new power harvesting concept are validated experimentally. Local generation of power will allow for a ‘plug and play’ rotor blade and signals may be logged or transmitted wirelessly to the body of the aircraft. Examples are the blade strains, hinge forces, vibrations and so on. At the ERF 2011 [1] presented a simulation model to predict the electrical output of a lag damper augmented with a piezoelectric based energy harvester. Simulations indicated that for an 8. 15 m blade the output is to be around 5 W. The concept includes a piezo <b>electric</b> <b>stack</b> mounted in the damper rod and in series with the damping element. All forces generated by the damper are also passed through the stack and through the piezo electric effect electric charge is generated. Through the use of advanced circuits the power is conditioned and can be stored in a large capacitor or battery located in the rotor hub. The concept is validated in the lab. The setup consists of a large stroke shaker delivering a high force at low frequency. A piezoelectric stack with a large pre-stress is used so that it can also cope with the tensile forces generated by the damper. A viscous damper which has no dead zone upon reversal of the motion is used to mimic the lag damper. Although the damper does not possess a similar damping profile as an actual lag damper this does not pose a problem as the peak force {{is more important than the}} exact profile. Lastly a laser vibrometer, a force sensor, a thermocouple and a voltmeter are utilized to log relevant data through a SigLab system. A number of experiments are conducted to verify the simulation model. Following individual component experimentation, different electrical circuits are coupled to the stack and each result is then compared to a simulation of the respective electrical configuration. Two circuits are to be validated: Direct Current Impedance Matching is used as it is a passive circuit and the ‘standard’ for power harvesting and Synchronous Switch Harvesting on Inductor is used as it is shown to be the best performing circuit investigated in previous simulations [2]. The desired end result is an experimentally validated simulation model of the lag damper - harvester model which can be used to predict power output of similar power harvesting system...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a method to control payload weight by knowing the moisture content of the wood. Weights, volumes, and moisture content were gathered from 100 truckloads of Sitka spruce pulpwood. Truck volume and weight utilization patterns were analyzed based on <b>stacked</b> volume, <b>truck</b> volume, and weights recorded from the weighbridge. Solid/bulk volume conversion factors for the truckloads were estimated indicating the truck’s solid volume capacity to be filled. Trucks were grouped into five conditions based on their configuration—volume capacity and legal maximum payload. A loaded volume fraction was estimated to assess the optimal volume capacity and stanchion height at which the trucks should be loaded. Results showed that 100 % of the trucks presented volume underutilization, with a maximum of 27. 5 m 3 (only 39. 85 % volume capacity). In contrast, 67 % of trucks were overweight while the remaining 33 % were under the legal maximum weight. The average solid/bulk volume conversion factor was 0. 66 ± 0. 013 at 95 % confidence level. Depending on the conditions, trucks can be filled to 100 % of their volume capacity with wood at an MC from 29 % to 55 %. The minimum truck volume capacity utilization was 45 %.

Testing {{is based on a}} new methodology that will show the level of success of the drying process management by analyzing the quality of drying process in a conventional dry kiln, using a scientifi cally improved version of the check list in everyday practical applications. A company that specializes in lamel and classic parquet production was chosen so as to verify the new testing methodology. A total of 56 m 3 of oak and hornbeam boards dried in a kiln were intended for use in parquet production. The length of the boards was 600 - 2000 mm, the width was 140 - 160 mm, and they were 30 mm thick. Before kiln testing, a checklist was made, according to methods of kiln operation control applied in the USA and Europe, with some modifi cations and changes of individual parts for adjustment to the technology and method of operation applied in Croatia. The evaluation was made so that each subcategory in the check list was rated from 5 to 1, i. e. from the highest to the lowest score. Three methods were used for the purpose of testing: visual check, measuring with instruments and interview of the dryer attendant. After the testing, analysis and systematization of all gathered data was carried out. The data were entered in a summarized check list, and the average results were provided for each tested category and for the whole kiln. The obtained results clearly show which parts of dry kiln, i. e. of drying process, failed to meet the test requirements. All subcategories rated 1 or 2 must be improved, while those rated 3 or 4 need to be analyzed once again in order to be improved. The parts of kiln and drying process related to fans and <b>electric</b> motors, <b>stack</b> placement, climatic conditions in the control room, moisture content control, and ability to develop and learn were far below the expectations.
