[...] For example, from a safety perspective, dual system (aka tandem) brakes were introduced along with a brake <b>failure</b> <b>warning</b> device. [...] The engine's state of tune was attenuated with a milder camshaft and a distributor with idle speed ignition timing retarded to address emissions.

30|$|Ping-pong {{messages}} were proposed {{to measure the}} signal strength and avoid initiating a false route <b>failure</b> <b>warning.</b> Ping-pong messages are actually small size packets used for probing a link state. A node sends a ping message and receives the pong message in response from the other node, to measure whether signal strength is either below or above the particular threshold. DSR and ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) [32] routing protocol were modified to implement this technique, and the modified versions are called preemptive DSR and preemptive AODV routing, respectively.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{lube oil}} {{separator}} {{is widely used}} in lube oil system of merchant vessel. The lube oil separator functions to purify the lube oil to ensure its good working performance. The working condition of the oil separator will greatly influence the normal running of many plants. The lube oil separator used in our laboratory is Mitsubishi SJ 700. In the processing of purifying, oil leakage from the water outlet is found. In order to find failure point, the basic structure and the working principle of the separator is introduced. The separator is dismantled according to the procedure. After cleaning some parts found dirty and replacing some sealing elements, the separator is reassembled. When starting the separating process again, the failure remains. Through further analyzing the structure and working principle of the separator, the trouble spot is found out. After removing the failure, the separator finally is repaired. To prevent similar accident occurring again, some suggestions are presented. Oil Leakage from Water-outlet In {{the operation of the}} lube oil separator working for the main engine, <b>failure</b> <b>warning</b> is emitted,and then lube oil leakage from the water-outlet is found.

The NASA Ames large-amplitude-motion Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) was utilized, and the experimental variables were the failure axis, the severity of the failure, and the airspeed at which the failure occurred. Other factors, such as pilot workload and terrain and obstacle proximity at the time of failure, were kept as constant as possible {{within the framework of the}} host simulation task scenarios. No explicit <b>failure</b> <b>warnings</b> were presented to the pilot.

40|$|Rolling-element bearing {{failures}} {{are the most}} frequent problems in rotating machinery, which can be catastrophic and cause major downtime. Hence, providing advance <b>failure</b> <b>warning</b> and precise fault detection in such components are pivotal and cost-effective. The vast majority of past {{research has focused on}} signal processing and spectral analysis for fault diagnostics in rotating components. In this study, a data mining approach using a machine learning technique called anomaly detection (AD) is presented. This method employs classification techniques to discriminate between defect examples. Two features, kurtosis and Non-Gaussianity Score (NGS), are extracted to develop anomaly detection algorithms. The performance of the developed algorithms was examined through real data from a test to failure bearing. Finally, the application of anomaly detection is compared with one of the popular methods called Support Vector Machine (SVM) to investigate the sensitivity and accuracy of this approach and its ability to detect the anomalies in early stages.
