500|$|In 2009 Mehldau also {{recorded}} Highway Rider, an album that combined his usual trio with guest musicians and a 28-piece orchestra. Again based compositionally {{on the theme}} of travel or a journey, the album was produced by Brion, and, in critic Mike Hobart's description, [...] "probes the confluence of the arbitrary and non-arbitrary in music, of balancing what is committed to the page with improvisation." [...] This was pursued further in the winter of 2010–11, in public performances of pieces from the album in the US and Europe. Mehldau's trio returned to the studio {{for the first time in}} several years in 2008 and again in 2011, resulting in Ode, an album of the pianist's originals, and Where <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Start,</b> an album of covers. Down Beat reviewer Jim Macnie commented that, on the former album, [...] "More than ever, Mehldau uses his instrument as a drum, popping staccato notes into the maw of the rhythm section's formidable bustle." ...|$|E

You had better pay your rent for three months in advance, and tell your landlord the same thing; saying that you may go suddenly anytime, as a compere who is in Paris, and is also going back, is going to take charge of you on the journey, and that he may call for you at any time.

False and cold I don't think you are; but {{you have made a}} great mistake in life, that I believe; I think your {{judgment}} is warped--that you are indifferent where you ought to be grateful--and perhaps devoted and infatuated, where you ought to be cool as your name.

It died in the past--in the present it lies buried--its grave is deep-dug, well-heaped, and many winters old: in the future there will be a resurrection, as I believe to my souls consolation; but all will then be changed--form and feeling: the mortal will have put on immortality--it will rise, not for earth, but heaven.

The Guardian's John Fordham observed [...] "the dynamics and empathy of this ensemble remain pretty irresistible". On All About Jazz, John Kelman noted [...] "Where <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Start</b> isn't so much an alternative as it is further evidence—as if any were needed—of this tremendous trio's ability to take any material—old, new, borrowed or original—and make it firmly its own". BBC Music reviewer, Martin Longley commented [...] "Where <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Start</b> revives the old Mehldau approach of covering songs from across the decades... Yet Mehldau’s method is so dominant that everything gravitates towards the trio’s signature sound, lending cohesion to a variegated crop... It all points to Mehldau entering a new prime phase in his career, both onstage and in the recording studio".|$|E
