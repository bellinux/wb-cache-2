5|$|Jedi Knight uses both 3D {{graphics}} and surround sound. It {{is one of}} the early games to adopt the use of 3D graphics <b>hardware</b> <b>acceleration</b> using Microsoft Direct3D. The 3D sound technology was tweaked extensively to give an immersive feel to the game. This was achieved by experimentation using many different sound effects and playback styles. Between levels Jedi Knight features full motion video cutscenes. The characters are represented by live actors while the backgrounds are pre-rendered graphics. The cutscenes included the first lightsaber footage filmed since Return of the Jedi in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The game {{made use}} of cutting edge {{technology}} such as force–feedback joysticks and controllers, 3D sound and Direct3D <b>Hardware</b> <b>Acceleration</b> and was largely well received. Critics noted that the game's graphics {{were some of the}} most technically impressive of the time. Overall, however, critics had mixed response for the graphics, as the demanding graphics resulted in poor draw distance; in particular, the PlayStation version struggled in this aspect. In general, the gameplay was favourably reviewed, with critics praising the solid, enjoyable missions, though there were complaints regarding a poor control system and unfairly high levels of difficulty.|$|E
5|$|It {{was known}} the game needed to use 3D {{graphics}} with <b>hardware</b> <b>acceleration</b> {{to keep up}} with trends. The goal was to have a 3D renderer good enough for deathmatch. The team was also aiming to have a software renderer for lower-end computers. The team used Direct X to improve the lighting effects. The audio was implemented by five team members. The music was composed by Mark Knight, and Nick Laviers was head of audio. The methods used was similar to those used by the BBC for their radio effects. David Armor and Shintaro Kanaoya headed the level design, working with the flow of the tweaked user interface created to reduce ambiguity when looking after the dungeon. In fact, the interface was redesigned more than ten times due to feedback from various groups because the team wanted the public to understand it. Testers played levels without any invading forces, which {{led to the development of}} My Pet Dungeon. An important feature to improve was the multiplayer, and great deal of effort was put into it.|$|E
50|$|However, on {{a system}} with limited OpenGL {{acceleration}} function, specifically {{the lack of an}} OpenGL Framebuffer Object or pbuffer, the use of an OpenGL environment like Xgl makes xv <b>hardware</b> <b>accelerations</b> impossible.|$|R

25|$|The Fallen Lords {{originally}} supported both software rendering and 3dfx's Glide <b>hardware</b> <b>acceleration.</b> Soon {{after it}} was released, Bungie released a v1.1 upgrade patch, which added support for Rendition's Redline, and 3dfx's Voodoo Rush.|$|E
25|$|After {{many years}} of development, today DirectSound is a mature API, and {{supplies}} many other useful capabilities, {{such as the ability}} to play multichannel sounds at high resolution. While DirectSound was designed to be used by games, today it is used to play audio in a large number of audio applications. DirectShow uses DirectSound's <b>hardware</b> audio <b>acceleration</b> capabilities if the sound card's <b>hardware</b> audio <b>acceleration</b> capabilities exist and are exposed by the audio driver.|$|R
50|$|In a trend-setting move, {{processors}} {{were designed}} with <b>hardware</b> encryption <b>acceleration</b> {{starting with the}} VIA C7. Following its release many Intel and AMD processors incorporate this feature.|$|R
40|$|This paper compares {{different}} hardware-based accelerations of {{the three}} classical splatting strategies: composite-every-sample, object-space sheet-buffer and image-space sheet-buffer. Specifically, we analyze the use of point sprites and 2 D textures for the splat’s projection, the use of frame-buffer objects for the buffer composition {{and the use of}} GPGPU techniques for the transformation of voxels. We compare the efficiency of the hardware-accelerated splatting with 3 D-texture mapping. In addition, we compare the rendering speed-up provided by <b>hardware</b> <b>accelerations</b> with two software-based space-leaping techniques: run-length encoding of labeled voxel models and voxel arrays. ...|$|R

25|$|The Mozilla Azure {{project is}} a {{stateless}} low-level graphics abstraction API used in Firefox. The project has several objectives including more accurate Direct2D compatibility, optimized state interoperability, and improved control over performance characteristics and bugs. Azure will provide 2D <b>hardware</b> <b>acceleration</b> on top of 3D graphics backends. Firefox began using Azure instead of Cairo in 2012.|$|E
25|$|In Windows 2000, Microsoft also {{implemented}} the same WDM-based audio stack on Windows NT by introducing the WDM audio drivers and the kernel mixer component (KMixer). In Windows XP, Microsoft introduced another improved kernel streaming class driver, AVStream. Beginning with Windows XP, <b>hardware</b> <b>acceleration</b> was also added for DirectSound capture effects processing such as Acoustic Echo Cancellation for USB microphones, noise suppression and array microphone support.|$|E
5000|$|Master of Orion III uses voxel {{graphics}} {{to render}} space battles and solar systems. Battles displaying 1000 ships {{at a time}} were rendered slowly on computers without <b>hardware</b> graphic <b>acceleration.</b>|$|R

50|$|Screen: 61 mm × 61 mm (2.37 inches × 2.37 inches), 160 × 160 pixels, 4 greys LCD. There was no <b>hardware</b> video <b>acceleration,</b> {{graphics}} had to {{be drawn}} by software to a framebuffer.|$|R
25|$|As of 2007, a {{solution}} to re-enable <b>hardware</b> <b>acceleration</b> of DirectSound3D and Audio Effects, such as EAX, called Creative ALchemy was launched. Creative ALchemy intercepts calls to DirectSound3D and translates them into OpenAL calls to be processed by supported hardware such as Sound Blaster X-Fi and Sound Blaster Audigy. For software-based Creative audio solutions, ALchemy utilizes its built-in 3D audio engine without using OpenAL at all.|$|E
25|$|The Fallen Lords {{originally}} supported both software rendering and 3dfx's Glide <b>hardware</b> <b>acceleration.</b> Soon {{after it}} was released, Bungie released a v1.1 upgrade patch, which added support for Rendition's Redline, and 3dfx's Voodoo Rush. Soulblighter originally supported software rendering, all 3dfx and Rendition GPUs, and any graphics cards that supported Direct3D for Windows and QuickDraw 3D for Mac. The game also supported 3D audio, specifically Aureal Semiconductor's A3D and Creative Labs' EAX.|$|E
25|$|In earlier {{computers}} and video game systems, sound effects were typically produced using sound synthesis. In modern systems, {{the increases in}} storage capacity and playback quality has allowed sampled sound to be used. The modern systems also frequently utilize positional audio, often with <b>hardware</b> <b>acceleration,</b> and real-time audio post-processing, which can also be tied to the 3D graphics development. Based on the internal state of the game, multiple different calculations can be made. This will allow for, for example, realistic sound dampening, echoes and doppler effect.|$|E
50|$|This section {{lists the}} known ability of an {{implementation}} {{to take advantage}} of CPU instruction sets that optimize encryption, or utilize system specific devices that allow access to underlying cryptographic <b>hardware</b> for <b>acceleration</b> or for data separation.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "Newport" [...] {{graphics}} {{and based on}} the REX3 chipset, these were designed for general 2D X11 applications; no <b>hardware</b> 3D <b>acceleration</b> is included. This is the first accelerator to demonstrate object-based antialiasing and sub-pixel exact Bresenham lines.|$|R
5000|$|Moving an OpenGL stream {{from one}} machine to another. For example, an OpenGL {{application}} {{running in a}} Windows virtual machine, without 3D acceleration, can make use of full <b>hardware</b> 3D <b>acceleration</b> on a Linux host machine via the use of Chromium.|$|R
25|$|Windows Vista {{introduces}} DirectX Video Acceleration (DXVA) 2.0 which {{enhances the}} implementation of the video pipeline and adds a host of other DDIs, including a Capture DDI for video capture. The DDIs it shares with DXVA 1.0 are also enhanced with support for <b>hardware</b> <b>acceleration</b> of more operations. Also, the DDI functions are directly available to callers and need not be mediated by the video renderer. As such, pipelines for simply decoding the media (without rendering) or post-processing and rendering (without decoding) can also be created. These features require the Windows Display Driver Model drivers.|$|E
25|$|Windows 98 {{introduced}} WDM Audio and the Kernel Audio Mixer driver (KMixer), {{which enabled}} digital mixing, routing and processing of simultaneous audio streams {{with a higher}} quality sample rate conversion as well as kernel streaming. Under WDM, DirectSound sends data to the software-based KMixer. Windows 98 Second Edition improved WDM audio support by adding DirectSound hardware buffering, DirectSound3D hardware abstraction, KMixer sample-rate conversion (SRC) for capture streams, multichannel audio support and introduction of DirectMusic. If the audio hardware supports hardware mixing (also known as hardware buffering or DirectSound <b>hardware</b> <b>acceleration),</b> DirectSound buffers directly to the rendering device. If DirectSound streams use hardware mixing, KMixer and its latency delay are bypassed. On Windows 98 and Windows Me, WDM audio drivers were preferred but compatibility with VxD driver model was preserved.|$|E
25|$|Chromium 12.0 was {{released}} on 11 March 2011, with 12.0.700.0 as the first version. Initial changes in the first versions of Chromium 12 included about:flags updates of test features, incorporating an fps counter for <b>hardware</b> <b>acceleration</b> benchmarks, a P2P API interface that may indicate future platform data exchange features, an enhanced URL bar and small changes to the tabs. Chromium 12 incorporated WebKit 534.24 and V8 javascript engine version 3.2.1.1. It is anticipated that a URL bar web app launcher will be added during the development cycle. Chromium 12 also introduced a new simplified 2D logo that replaced the 3D style logo used from the project since its inception. Early in the Chromium 12 cycle the history quick provider was introduced. This feature automatically searches the browser history for websites visited in the past 72 hours looking for matching page titles and URLs. It also searches through URLs that have been typed {{at least twice as}} well as URLs that have been visited at least four times ever.|$|E
