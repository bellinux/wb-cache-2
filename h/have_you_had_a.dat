5|$|Look, I'm sorry you're dead OK? I do care. But to be {{perfectly}} honest with you, I don't care a lot. You had a choice, you took the drugs, you died. Are you seriously claiming no one warned you it was dangerous?... I mean, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> look at the world lately?... There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E
6000|$|CHARLES. Hollo! Brother--what {{has been}} the matter? your Fellow wouldn't let me up at first--What[?] <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> Jew or a wench with you.-- ...|$|E
6000|$|She didn’t get {{any further}} because I had {{jumped up and}} frightened her by shouting: “Is she ill? What has happened? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> letter?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; and mamma, too--that is, <b>had</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> fortune," [...] {{said the}} daughter, naïvely. [...] "She always liked you personally, always." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} you are capable of such <b>a</b> passion, my son? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> {{attachment}} that was superior to novelty or self-interest?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{countersign}} was returned. 'Bearn and Bourbon is {{the word}} to-day, comrade,' replied the sentinel. 'Eh quoi! <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> encounter, that <b>you</b> bring a wounded man?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I'm not, my man; but I have an {{objection}} {{to enter a}} public-house, unless I cannot help it. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> glass this morning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} have some proof to support what you have said of Nugent," [...] he resumed, {{stopping}} in the courtyard. [...] "Have you written to England since you have been here? and <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> reply?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Far, far away, my dear. Put my {{gardenia}} in, your buttonhole. Stop, I'll pin it in. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good rest {{all this}} week? Do {{you like my}} dress? It's new. You wouldn't have noticed it, would you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can read, I find. Better, I think, {{than any}} of the maids I <b>have</b> <b>had.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very nice {{expressive}} voice, and you will do better when you read a book through from the beginning, and feel interested in it. I shall let you read every day to me. What else did you learn-- writing?" ...|$|R
40|$|Francesville {{was laid}} out in 1852 by James Brooks, a {{railroad}} president from New Albany, and supposedly named for his daughter Frances. Mrs. M. I. Homer, Normal School, Shippensburg, Pa. Dear Mrs. H. I hear <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> new car. Don't let Mr. H. run off the track will <b>you.</b> <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> increase in the cat family. I'm having the best time ever. Much love, Ada Horto...|$|R
5000|$|Garfield: <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{day when}} <b>you</b> felt like you've slept and eaten it all? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes: I {{was beating}} out some bags. And <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good bonfire up there? I saw the light. Why did Miss Vye want a bonfire {{so bad that}} she should give you sixpence to keep it up?" ...|$|E
60|$|PATIOMKIN [effusively]. Darling, I am a man; {{and you are}} a man; and Catherine is a woman. Woman reduces us all to {{the common}} denominator. [Chuckling.] Again an epigram! [Gravely.] You {{understand}} it, I hope. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> college education, darling? I have.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{not aware}} of it. I am {{surprised}} to hear it, Ruth. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> letter too. I have seen the letter. But {{what do you mean by}} telling me that you do not know I am Henrietta's mother? Are you trying to be funny?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And Duncan of Lundie will {{be honored}} the day he {{receives}} it. But, Sergeant, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> never <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lieutenant-colonelcy, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good wife, {{and that is the}} next thing to rank in making a man happy." ...|$|R
6000|$|Finally Jim said, [...] "For {{two cents}} I'd {{go out and}} snake them cats off that chimney." [...] So I said, [...] "Of course you would." [...] He said, [...] "Well, I would; I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> mighty good notion to do it." [...] Says I, [...] "Of course <b>you</b> have; {{certainly}} <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> great notion to do it." [...] I hoped he might try it, but I was afraid he wouldn't.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} weren't so damned monosyllabic. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> never <b>had</b> <b>a</b> moment's regret {{for all the}} {{unhappiness}} you caused them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Rose {{subsided}} {{into her}} former seat, surveying her cousin with much satisfaction as she said: [...] "This {{is the third}} surprise I've had since I came. Uncle popped in upon us first, then Phebe, and now you. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> pleasant tramp? Uncle said you were off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right--ALL RIGHT?" [...] Delia Dosson repeated, {{springing}} up. [...] "Yes indeed--I {{should say}} so!" [...] Then she checked herself, asking in another manner: [...] "Is that so? poppa sent you up?" [...] And then in still another: [...] "Well, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good time at Nice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, well--I {{have said}} more than enough of my last night's amusement," [...] he confessed. [...] "It's your turn now, my dear. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> look at the poor fellow whom the doctor is going to cure?" [...] he asked abruptly; eager to {{discover}} whether she had noticed the likeness between Oxbye and himself.|$|E
60|$|Poly. Go, bear {{them to the}} torture; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> boasted <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> king to head you; I {{would know}} To whom I must resign.|$|R
6000|$|Q.--What illness <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had?</b> A.--As <b>a</b> child, consumption, leprosy, {{and water}} on [...] the knee. As a man, whooping-cough, stomach-ache, [...] and {{water on the}} brain.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{you will}} not feel the need of me as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done ... <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sure trust in God ... I shall not look for you in vain at the last.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{greatest}} {{luck in the}} world. It's {{always that}} way in stories," [...] retorted Upton. Then he noticed the pale face of the younger lad, and dropping his axe he sprang forward, [...] "Say, boy, what's happened?" [...] he demanded anxiously. [...] "You're white as a sheet. Are you hurt or <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> fright? Spit it out!" ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS WARREN. Gone {{out to have}} a pipe. [The clergyman {{takes his}} hat from the table, and joins Mrs Warren at the fireside. Meanwhile, Vivie comes in, {{followed}} by Frank, who collapses into the nearest chair with an air of extreme exhaustion. Mrs Warren looks round at Vivie and says, with her affectation of maternal patronage even more forced than usual] Well, dearie: <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good supper? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The devil it was!--I {{see the old}} fellow {{loves to}} tickle the drum of his own ear now and then with {{familiar}} sounds; but <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> muster of the cattle from the farmyard too, {{as well as a}} parade of the guard? I hear the trampling of feet, as if the old abbey were a second ark, and all the beasts of the field were coming aboard of us!" ...|$|E
60|$|Mister, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>had</b> <b>a</b> real shock--something {{that came}} out of nowhere and just knocked <b>you</b> flat? I <b>have,</b> and I'm {{going to tell you about}} it.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, Moore, {{what is your}} {{business}} with us? I thought you would want us to-night--me and the hetman here (patting his pony's neck), and Tom and his charger. When I heard your mill-bell I could sit still no longer, so I left Boultby to finish his supper alone. But where is the enemy? I do not see a mask or a smutted face present; {{and there is not}} a pane of glass broken in your windows. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> attack, or do <b>you</b> expect one?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Madame Pratolungo? Yes. I hope {{somebody}} has told Miss Finch you are here. She {{has her own}} establishment, and manages everything herself. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> pleasant journey?" [...] (These words were spoken vacantly, as if her mind was occupied with something else. My first impression of her suggested {{that she was a}} weak, good-natured woman, and that she must have originally occupied a station in the humbler ranks of life.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's amiss with Charlie? I {{thought he}} was the prince of cavaliers. Annabel says he dances 'like an angel,' and I know a dozen mothers couldn't keep him at home of an evening. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> tiff with Adonis and so fall back on poor me?" [...] asked Mac, coming last to the person of whom he thought first but did not mention, feeling shy about {{alluding}} to a subject often discussed behind her back.|$|E
6000|$|Eleonora's {{little white}} feet sped quickly up the steps, {{and with a}} hasty good night, she sped across the hall, but paused at the door. [...] "Papa must not be disappointed," [...] she whispered to herself, and dashed {{her hand over her}} eyes; and at the moment the lock turned, and a gray head appeared, with a mighty odour of smoke. [...] "Ah! I thought my little Lena would not pass me by! <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{pleasant}} party, my dear? Was young Strangeways there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "India!" [...] cried Lady Marayne. [...] "The East. Poff, {{what is the}} MATTER with you? Has {{something}} happened--something else? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> been <b>having</b> <b>a</b> love affair?--a REAL love affair?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Daughter Pad, you are welcome: What, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{performed}} the last Christian office to your keeper; I saw you follow {{him up the}} heavy hill to Tyburn. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> never <b>a</b> business since his death? ...|$|R
