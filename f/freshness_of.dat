5|$|Turkish cuisine is {{regarded}} as one of the most prominent in the world, its popularity is largely owed to the cultural influences of the Ottoman Empire and partly because of its major tourism industry. It is largely the heritage of Ottoman cuisine, which can be described as a fusion and refinement of Central Asian, Caucasian, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Balkan cuisines. The country's position between the East and the Mediterranean Sea helped the Turks gain complete control of major trade routes, and an ideal environment allowed plants and animals to flourish. Turkish cuisine was well established by the mid-1400s, the beginning of the Ottoman Empire's six hundred-year reign. Yogurt salads, fish in olive oil, and stuffed and wrapped vegetables became Turkish staples. The empire, eventually spanning from Austria to northern Africa, used its land and water routes to import exotic ingredients from all over the world. By the end of the 16th century, the Ottoman court housed over 1,400 live-in cooks and passed laws regulating the <b>freshness</b> <b>of</b> food. Since the fall of the empire in World War I (1914–1918) and the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, foreign food such as French hollandaise sauce and western fast food have made their way into the modern Turkish diet.|$|E

This study assessed trace metals concentration and <b>freshness</b> quality <b>of</b> Catfish (Clarias gariepinus) preserved by oven-drying, brining/oven drying and smoking. The fish were processed to average moisture contents of 15 ± 5 %. Processed fish samples were stored in perforated plastic containers for 11 successive weeks at room temperature and assessed weekly for levels of trace metals (Fe, Zn, Cd, Pb) and physical attributes of odour, flavour and texture. Microbial load was assessed by total viable count (TVC) and biochemical activity by total volatile nitrogen (TVN). The <b>freshness</b> quality <b>of</b> processed fish decreased with increasing storage time and all samples preserved using the three preservation methods contained levels of trace metals below the recommended limits for trace metals in fish and are therefore safe for human consumption...|$|R

25|$|Cho and Garcia-Molina {{proved the}} {{surprising}} result that, {{in terms of}} average freshness, the uniform policy outperforms the proportional policy in both a simulated Web and a real Web crawl. Intuitively, the reasoning is that, as web crawlers have {{a limit to how}} many pages they can crawl in a given time frame, (1) they will allocate too many new crawls to rapidly changing pages at the expense of less frequently updating pages, and (2) the <b>freshness</b> <b>of</b> rapidly changing pages lasts for shorter period than that of less frequently changing pages. In other words, a proportional policy allocates more resources to crawling frequently updating pages, but experiences less overall freshness time from them.|$|E

He founded a university at Nagyszombat in 1635 from which Jesuit missionaries could carry on their activities throughout Royal Hungary. The archbishop and the Jesuits managed to persuade more and more members of the high nobility, among them members of the Zrinyi, Batthyány, and Wesselényi families to join Catholicism. The example of the magnates was followed by numerous other noblemen, thus at the Diet of 1638 the majority of the deputies representing the counties was already Catholic.|$|E

25|$|Vladimir Becić's {{earliest}} works {{date from}} the time of the Munich school, and together with the works of Josip Račić and Miroslav Kraljević, they point to a new direction in Croatian modern painting. Moving away from traditional academic styles, they are strongly influenced by Leibl's realism, and the works of Impressionist artists such as Manet whose work they saw in an exhibit of 1907. Other influences at that time were Velázquez and Goya. Becić's later works show an approach that is closer to Cézanne, and emphasizing the structure and geometric shapes. His artistic expression was focused towards modeling and clarity. His sketches in oil, and especially watercolour, express the <b>freshness</b> <b>of</b> the immediate experience. He uses rich colour expression, and tone shaping for strong volume.|$|E

It was not enough and in the end a 22-man squad could not last against the huge numbers and <b>freshness</b> <b>of</b> the Belfast Trojans team. Many players felt it was one of the gutsiest Vikings performances in recent years but just not good enough. Excellent young players like Sean Goldrick, Ian Cahill, Paul Keane, Shane Gleeson and Eoin Whelan matured on the field and bode well for the Future of the team. Overall, the Vikings learned the hard way that you can't win if you don't score no matter how good your Defence is as was the story of their entire season and many seasons past. The future is bright for this new generation of Vikings and keep a close eye on 2014 which is sure to be a huge one for this team.|$|E
