40|$|LectureThe Oil & Gas {{industry}} faces increasing {{challenges to}} meet growing energy demands {{with the most}} sustainable exploration and production techniques. Compressor manufacturers have responded to these challenges {{with the development of}} <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>compressors,</b> enabling gas compression with minimized environmental footprint. The main feature in all of these designs is integration of driver and driven unit into a single casing. As a result, there is no shaft protruding out of the casing, hence {{there is no need for}} shaft sealing elements like dry gas seals that have traditionally suffered poorest reliability. There is one major disadvantage of this design concept: electrical components from electrical motor and active magnetic bearings are introduced in a process gas environment. This may not be so detrimental on compressor applications handling clean, export-quality gas allowing <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> technology with the electrical insulation system directly exposed to the process gas used for cooling purposes. However, for non-clean, toxic or corrosive applications the electrical components require either special treatment or, alternatively, need to be separated from the process gas. Authors? company has introduced the STC-ECO following the latter principle, a field-proven <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed,</b> canned, <b>compressor</b> specifically designed to meet the requirements of the most demanding upstream applications. The applications have been defined and described in four distinct material categories. The primary design concept of the Electrical, Canned and Oil-free (ECO) unit is its 'canned' technology. The electric motor, Active Magnetic Bearings and instrumentation are separated from the process gas by cylindrical parts integrated in stationary housing parts, such that no electrical component is exposed to process gas. A first prototype of a canned <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>compressor</b> has operated over 50. 000 hours since installation in 2006 on a natural gas asset in the Netherlands. For more severe sour and corrosive applications, special precautions were required on the compressor package design, among which a patented hybrid rotor design and hybrid thrust disk design. The hybrid technology contains separate sections of different materials welded together to form one multi- functional solid component. Furthermore, the motor stator 'can', separating the motor stator windings from the cooling process gas, was subjected to a series of qualification tests at research institutes in the Netherlands to qualify the compatibility to H 2 S and corrosive conditions. For an upstream gas compression project in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, such a 5. 8 MW unit capable of handling sour gas was designed, built and ASME PTC- 10 Type- 1 tested at the Author's company facility in Hengelo, The Netherlands. Upon completion of an extensive test program including emergency landing test on the auxiliary bearing system, the unit was shipped and commissioned at site in the Middle East and started operation in June 2015. The paper covers the design concept of the 'canned' <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> technology, highlights the design aspects making it suitable for sour and corrosive applications and describes the unit built and tested for the upstream gas compression project of Saudi Aramco...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{environmental}} concerns and energy consumption become more important. Therefore, compressor manufacturers try to design high-efficiency reciprocating compressors.

Nevertheless, {{the effects of}} electrical motors are significant phenomena. The thermal behavior of an electrical motor {{is very important for}} motor performance, but also has a key role for compressor components heat transfer characteristics. In this study, heat transfer between the components and the electrical motor of the hermetic reciprocating compressor were investigated theoretically and experimentally. The compressor performance, indicator diagram, motor tests and the detailed temperature measurements of electrical motor and compressor components were given. Analytical model simulations of induction motor and compressor components were performed by using commercial softwares. This part describes analytical models to predict the temperatures of motor and the other parts of hermetic reciprocating compressor. The model simulations allow determining component temperatures with different motor temperatures theoretically. In addition to this, conceptual designs, which have affected the heat transfer on the components and performance of the compressor, were also applied during the study. The results of the theoretical, analytical and experimental studies are used for investigating the network including conduction, convection and radiationÂ forms of heat transfer inside the compressor.

40|$|A general {{procedure}} {{for the analysis}} of curved or flat, thin two dimensional muffler elements, which can efficiently utilize the limited space of <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>compressors</b> or small engine compartments, was developed. This procedure can also be applied to analyze thin compressor or engine manifolds as long as the thickness of the cavities is sufficiently small compared to the shortest wavelength of interest. ^ The two dimensional inhomogeneous wave equation, which takes nonuniform thickness into account, is expressed in two dimensional curvilinear coordinates by the application of Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s principle. Four pole parameters are formulated from the pressure response solutions using the modal series expansion method and orthogonality property. ^ This procedure can not only handle a single-input single-output cavity but also multi- input cavities. A practical two-cylinder compressor was analyzed as an application example. Four poles and transfer functions for each input/output set were obtained separately. The pressure response at the exit excited by each input were obtained by multiplying the input volume flow rates from each cylinder with the corresponding transfer functions. The total pressure response was then calculated by superposition of the individual pressure responses. ^ A line impedance method was proposed to analyze the composite gas cavities which consist of two different thin gas cavities sharing a common line-like boundary. Line impedances were formulated from the pressure responses of thin, curved or flat cavities to line volume flow rate inputs which are distributed harmonically along the interface of the two subsystems. The composite system frequency equation was derived and then solved for the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the combined systems. ...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} design parameters for <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>compressors</b> used in domestic refrigerators are the Coefficient of Performance (COP); low manufacturing and operating costs; long operating life, low {{noise and vibration}} levels and to achieve environmentally friendly constructions. Positive displacement piston type compressors are used in refrigerators today due to their high capacity/volume ratios. Hence, the bearings of the hermetic compressors must also satisfy these design conditions. Investigation and optimization of crank shaft bearings in hermetic compressor applications are the main objectives of this study. The effect of crank shaft geometry, bearing clearance, lubricant viscosity, surface roughness and bearing location along the shaft on the friction losses were investigated and the new journal bearing designs were developed. Detailed parametric numerical simulations were performed using commercial software. According {{to the results of}} the simulations number of compressors were assembled with the selected design parameters and performance measurements were carried out. The results of the numerical analysis have shown that the numerically calculated mechanical loss level is similar to the performance results measured in a calorimeter test system. Results of the simulations and experiments were evaluated with six sigma (6 ?) techniques. Measurement of the efficiency of the compressor with the improved bearing design showed 1. 3 % increase in the coefficient of performance (COP) with respect to the compressor with previous bearing design. This study shows that the mechanical loss characteristics are significantly influenced by the length of the bearings, clearance between the crankshaft journal and its bearing, kinematic viscosity and operating conditions. Bearing analysis results help to characterize the optimum journal bearing parameters which lead to improved mechanical efficiency of the compressor...|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. Since the {{promulgation}} of the Montreal Protocol many refrigerants {{needed to}} be phased out. R- 22, which is a widely used refrigerant in refrigeration systems, was one of these. Many replacements have been found throughout the years but very few have the same refrigeration capacity without being penalised {{by an increase in}} pressure drop. R- 407 C is one of the refrigerants having the potential to replace R- 22 as it has the same theoretical coefficient of performance and has a lower global warming potential. However, due to its zeotropic characteristics there is a degradation in heat transfer during evaporation and condensation attributed to mass transfer resistance. Thus, augmentation techniques are needed not only to increase the heat capacity, but also to achieve an increase without incurring an excessive pressure drop. One approach to cope with this problem is {{to make use of the}} recently developed herringbone micro-fin tubes. Unfortunately very little data exists for refrigerants undergoing condensation inside herringbone micro-fin tubes. There is also little pressure drop information available for this type of tube. An experimental set-up was designed to determine the characteristics of this type of tube due to the scarcity of information. With the aid of current literature, various techniques were used to determine the pressure drops inside the herringbone micro-fin tube. One of these techniques was the use of the Kattan-Thome-Favrat flow regime map which helped to identify the flow patterns inside the tube. Knowledge of the type of flow occurring inside the tube helped to clarify the behaviour of the pressure drop relationships. The type of refrigerant being used also affected the behaviour of the pressure drop curves. A low-pressure refrigerant had a higher pressure drop due to the high vapour velocities achieved. Another cause for excessive pressure drop is the friction created by the high velocity vapour and condensate inside the tube. Many relationships for the friction factor exist and these are used to analyse the experimental data. The experimental facility comprised of a vapour compression loop and a water loop. The vapour compression loop consisted of a <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>compressor</b> with a cooling capacity of 9. 6 kW, a manually operated expansion valve and an evaporator. Three condensers were tested, namely a smooth tube, a helical micro-fin tube, and a herringbone micro-fin tube. The condensers were of the tube-in-tube type with the refrigerant flowing in the inner tube and the water in counter flow in the annulus. The hot water loop was used as a source for the evaporator and a cold loop as a heat sink for the condenser. Three refrigerants were tested, namely R- 22, R- 134 a, and R- 407 C, all operating at a nominal saturation temperature of 40 °C and at mass fluxes between 300 and 800 kg/m 2 s. Accurate sensors and transducers were used to measure the temperatures, pressures, and mass flows at predefined points. Video cameras were attached to sight glasses to aid in the identification of the type of flow regime. Data were captured using a computerised data acquisition programme designed specifically for use with the experimental study. The experimental results showed that transition between the annular and intermittent flow regimes occurred at around 25 % vapour quality for the herringbone micro-fin tube, as opposed to 30 % for the helical micro-fin tube and 50 % for the smooth tube. Pressure drops for the herringbone micro-fin tube were higher than those for the smooth tube but slightly lower than those for the helical micro-fin tube when using refrigerants R- 22 and R- 134 a. The correlation of Liebenberg was modified for the pressure drops inside the herringbone micro-fin tube and gave a mean deviation of 12 %. The efficiency ratio for the herringbone tube using R- 22 was 1. 85 and 1. 69 when compared with the helical micro-fin and smooth tube respectively. For R- 134 the efficiency ratio was 2. 02 and 2. 13 when compared with the helical micro-fin and smooth tube respectively, while for R- 407 C it was 1. 58 and 1. 26 for the two respectively. It was also concluded that R- 407 C could be used as a replacement refrigerant for R- 22 when used with a herringbone micro-fin tube...|$|R
