2500|$|His smoking {{increased}} to three packs {{a day and}} he suffered from various stress-related ailments such as frequent severe headaches, indigestion, insomnia, anxiety, eczema and heart palpitations, while his weight dropped to ninestone (126lb / 57kg). In order to keep to his 16-hour workdays, <b>he</b> <b>sniffed</b> Benzedrine {{during the day and}} then took tranquillizers and sleeping pills at night to offset the effects and allow him to sleep.

2500|$|Among Steiner's {{non-traditional}} views, in {{his autobiography}} titled Errata from 1997, Steiner relates his sympathetic stance towards {{the use of public}} houses since his college years at the University of Chicago. As Steiner states, [...] "My virginity offended Alfie (his college room-mate). He found it ostentatious and vaguely corrupt in a nineteen-year-old... <b>He</b> <b>sniffed</b> the fear in me with disdain. And marched me off to Cicero, Illinois, a town justly ill famed but, by virtue of its name, reassuring to me. There he organized, with casual authority, an initiation as thorough as it was gentle. It is this unlikely gentleness, the caring under circumstances so outwardly crass, that blesses me still." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gessner {{has been}} {{described}} as the father of modern scientific botany and zoology, and the father of modern bibliography. To his contemporaries he was best known as a botanist. Despite his traveling ways and the job of maintaining his own gardens, Gesner probably {{spent most of his time}} inside his own extensive library. He listed among his History of Animals sources more than 80 Greek authors and at least 175 Latin authors, as well as works by German, French, and Italian authors. He even attempted to establish a [...] "universal library" [...] of all books in existence. The project might sound strange to the modern mind, but Gessner invested tremendous energy in the project. <b>He</b> <b>sniffed</b> through remote libraries along with the collections of the Vatican Library and catalogs of printers and booksellers. By assembling this universal library of information, Gessner put together a database centuries before computers would ease such work. He cut relevant passages out of books, grouped the cuttings by general theme, subdivided the groups into more specific categories, and boxed them. He could then retrieve and arrange the cuttings as needed. In the words of science writer Anna Pavord, [...] "He was a one-man search engine, a 16th-century Google with the added bonus of critical evaluation." ...|$|E
