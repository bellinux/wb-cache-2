The cowls were initially fitted to 100 vehicles, and improved access to the control panel and tiller gear.

5000|$|In 1979 the Ambassadors front {{went through}} a major {{facelift}} departing from the flatter design of the 1950s which was retained till its end in 2014. The front grill was much smaller in height with a larger chequered grill and square park lamps. Now separate amber indicator lamps was incorporated on the semi front lip spoiler below the bumper, which was mounted higher up. This model was named as the Mark 4. In addition to the existing petrol version, a diesel variant was launched which was powered by a 1489 cc, 37 bhp BMC B-series diesel engine. It was the first diesel car in India and was well received by the Indians, although it was initially only available as a taxi or for government usage, as the Indian government restricted private ownership of diesel automobiles. The Mark IV {{was the last of}} the Mark cars. For a short period the cars were available as [...] "Deluxe" [...] & later it was renamed Ambassador Nova. The Ambassador of 1990 (except for the <b>front</b> <b>cowl</b> area) was virtually identical to the 1956 original, with most changes being light and cosmetic. The changes were mainly the front styling and minor changes to the dashboard. This technological stagnation was mainly because of the protectionist policies being pursued by the Indian government at the time, and there was little incentive on the part of Indian companies to innovate.|$|E
50|$|The M-497 (nicknamed Black Beetle by the press) was an {{experimental}} jet-powered locomotive test {{bed of the}} New York Central Railroad (NYC) corporation, developed and tested in 1966 in the United States.

40|$|Drag {{measurements}} on bluff-bodies such as bobsleighs using force balance {{systems have been}} in prevalence for a few decades. However these studies do not reveal anything on the flow behaviour around the body. In the recent past, various flow visualization techniques have been applied to investigate the flow behaviour around bobsleighs. Even though these studies have highlighted the qualitative flow features, {{there is a lack}} of a deep insight into the wake flow topology and the behaviour of the flow structures that are formed in the highly three-dimensional flow. Additionally, when the bobsleigh moves in a curvilinear path, the <b>front</b> <b>cowling</b> rotates with respect to the rear cowling, causing an increase in the frontal area exposed to the wind and in turn a higher drag. However, this perception is not quite straightforward and requires a thorough understanding of the mechanisms and sources of drag generation, in particular at different <b>front</b> <b>cowling</b> angles. Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry has been used to study the near-wake flow topology of a scaled bobsleigh model. From the velocity field information obtained from PIV, the pressure field in the wake of the bobsleigh model is determined from the Pressure Poisson Equation (PPE) using the methodology outlined by Oudheusden [41]. With the knowledge of the velocity and the pressure fields, the aerodynamic drag is computed using the control volume approach on a wake plane which is at approximately two diameters from the model. The drag obtained from PIV is compared to that obtained from balance measurements. The effects of different bobsleigh configurations on the aerodynamic drag is observed. Secondly, uncertainty quantification of the aerodynamic drag is performed. Finally, a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) analysis is performed for the velocity fluctuations in order to gain an insight on the motion of the flow structures formed in the wake. The investigation of the near wake flow topology of the bobsleigh reveals the presence of two counter-rotating vortices with a significant downwash between them in case of the reference configuration. The motion and behaviour of these vortices is obtained by performing the PIV analysis on multiple vertical wake planes. The investigation of the effect of the <b>front</b> <b>cowling</b> misalignment on the drag reveals that there is a reduction of drag for smaller misalignment angles (upto 5 °) and a marginal increase in drag for further increase of misalignment (from 5 ° to 20 °). From the analysis of aerodynamic drag conducted on a vertical plane that is approximately two diameters behind the model, it can be seen that the momentum deficit is the highest contributor to the aerodynamic drag (88 %) followed by the Reynolds stresses (9 %) and pressure (3 %). It is also observed that the aerodynamic drag obtained is in good agreement with the results obtained from the balance measurements with a variation of only 2 to 3 %. The uncertainty analysis of drag shows that among the different flow variables which affect the drag, the average pressure has the maximum uncertainty. Finally, the POD analysis of the velocity fluctuations shows that the first two fluctuating modes which are the most energetic are not perfectly correlated to each other due to the highly three-dimensional nature of the flow...|$|R
40|$|During {{hot summer}} days outside {{temperature}} often exceeds 30 °C. Without air condition system {{it is impossible}} to achieve temperature inside car compartment at the same level or lower than outside, even with high air flow. Driver’s efficiency researches indicate that it can be even 35 % higher at + 20 °C than at + 35 °C. Decrease of efficiency at + 5 °C can be the same as that at + 35 °C.

The company's name was Ki-100-1-Ko. All of the airframes were remanufactured from Ki-61-II Kai and Ki-61-III airframes; the integral engine mount/cowling side panel was cut off the fuselage and a tubular steel engine mount was bolted to the firewall/bulkhead. Many of the redundant fittings from the liquid-cooled engine, such as the ventral radiator shutter actuator, were still kept. The first 271 aircraft, or Ki-100-1-Ko, with the raised [...] "razorback" [...] rear fuselage were rolled out of the factory between March and June 1945. A further 118 Ki-100 I-Otsu were built with a cut-down rear fuselage and new rear-view canopy from May through to the end of July 1945.

40|$|Two new {{approaches}} {{are discussed in}} this paper for application in the Scramjet inlet of an air-breathing propulsion system: 1) In the first approach, the pylon set is installed in the rectangular inlet near the <b>cowl</b> <b>front</b> edge.

Fuel injection takes place through these pylons, which provides for uniform mixing downstream. The locations, sizes and angles of these pylons are very important for efficient application. Optimal values of geometrical parameters were determined from multi-parametric NSE-based numerical simulations of the laminar and turbulent external/internal flows.

50|$|When introduced, {{the number}} of VentiPorts (three or four) denoted the size of straight-eight engine installed. Since {{displacement}} differences in straight-eight engines resulted in more dramatic differences in engine length than on V8s, the Buick Roadmaster (which was the only model at {{this time with the}} larger engine) needed a longer chassis in <b>front</b> of the <b>cowl</b> to accommodate the larger engine. Thus an extra VentiPort also corresponded directly to the necessary extra length in front. After the more compact V8 replaced the straight-eight engine in 1953 this difference in chassis length was no longer needed. Nevertheless, the convention remained. Consequently, when the Buick Century, which shared the Buick Special's smaller body, was reintroduced in 1954, it also received four VentiPorts to denote its engine's greater displacement. However, in 1955, the Buick Super, which shared Roadmaster's larger body, was promoted from three to four VentiPorts despite having the smaller displacement engine. In turn, the Buick Invicta which took the place of the Buick Century in 1959, and consequently had the smaller body with the larger displacement engine, was demoted from four to three VentiPorts on introduction. Thus {{the number of}} VentiPorts came to denote body size rather than engine size.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the vehicle cooling system strongly depends on the air flow through the radiator core. The flow through the radiator core in turn depends on other panels {{that are in the}} vicinity of the radiator and these include the radiator cover, grille, <b>front</b> inner panel, <b>cowl,</b> floor, etc. A clear understanding of the flow pattern inside the radiator cover is essential for optimizing the radiator cover shape to increase the flow through the radiator core, thereby increasing the thermal {{efficiency of}} the radiator. In this paper, CFD enabled optimization of airflow distribution inside the radiator cover is discussed. Starting from a CFD solution of the baseline design that was validated against indoor test data, a series of optimization cases were executed to arrive at the optimum configuration of the radiator cover. The airflow distribution inside the radiator cover and the flow through the radiator core was monitored to provide a quantitative basis for the optimization process. The CFD analysis was conducted using the commercial software FLUENT™, while the surface and volume mesh were generated using ANSA ™ and TGRID™, respectively. Use of ANSA ™ for surface meshing was instrumental in reducing the CFD cycle time. CFD analysis of the baseline design that was validated against test data showed that significant regions of re-circulating flow existed inside the radiator cover. This recirculation reduced the flow through the radiator core, leading to a build-up of hot air pockets close to the radiator surface and subsequent degradation of radiator thermal efficiency. The CFD enabled optimization led to radiator cover configuration that eliminated these recirculation regions and increased the flow through the radiator core by 34 %. It is anticipated that this increase in radiator core flow would significantly increase the radiator thermal efficiency...|$|R
