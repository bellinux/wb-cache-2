40|$|<b>Failure</b> <b>mode</b> and <b>effect</b> <b>analysis</b> {{has been}} applied in {{manufacturing}} and service industries but can still be improved. <b>Failure</b> <b>mode</b> and <b>effect</b> <b>analysis</b> is a common tool used to evaluate risk priority number; however, numerous scholars have doubted the effectiveness of <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> and <b>effect</b> <b>analysis</b> and have thus proposed methods for correcting <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> and <b>effect</b> <b>analysis</b> from its conventional formula. Because implemented actions can determine or influence resource allocation and its effects, completing one corrective action can occasionally simultaneously improve various <b>failure</b> <b>modes.</b> In this study, <b>failure</b> <b>mode</b> and <b>effect</b> <b>analysis</b> and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory were integrated to correct <b>failure</b> <b>modes</b> and increase their effectiveness.
