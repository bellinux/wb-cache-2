40|$|ABSTRACT. Pharyngostomy is a {{technique}} of proven use-fulness in patients requiring extra oral enteric access. Tech-niques to perform this have required an operating room, general anesthesia, and the associated risks. We have developed {{a technique}} for needle pharyngostomy that can be performed at the bedside of an awake patient. We utilize a central venous catheter tray and a small bore feeding tube to do this procedure. We have performed this on 17 patients without a procedural complication. This form of enteric access has allowed total nutritional support for up to 2 yr. Two late infections at the pharyngostomy site have occurred; both were easily controlled with oral antibiotics. This technique is recommended for pa-tients who repeatedly pull out feeding tubes or are planning home enteral nutrition. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 9 : 68 - 70, 1985) The pharyngostomy was developed 30 yr ago as a feeding technique for patients with oropharyngeal car-cinomas. ’ Since its inception, this procedure has also been used to treat patients with aphagopraxia due to neurologic disease and those with extensive maxillofacial trauma. 2 - 4 This procedure has been simplified from one requiring open neck dissection to the present technique of Graham and Royster, 5 ° which involves passing a large, curved clamp orally into the pyriform sinus and dissect-ing down onto it. We have developed a simple, bedside, percutaneous technique for insertion of a pharyngostomy feeding catheter and have performed this procedure on 17 patients over the last 2 yr. Herein we describe our technique and our experience with it. TECHNIQUE This procedure requires a no. 8 French silicon feeding catheter with a <b>detachable</b> <b>connector</b> (Cartmill Feeding Tube, MKR Assoc., Scottsdale, AZ), a commercially available no. 7 French central venous catheter tra...|$|E

The connection of the backplane with optical transmitter and receiver modules on standard printed circuit boards has been accomplished by means of <b>detachable</b> optical <b>connectors.</b> The optoelectronic modules have been supplied by Alcatel SEL, Stuttgart, whereas the optical connectors have been developed by the University of Mannheim. The key results of the project are: -Development of a polymer waveguide technology for the realisation of 200 mm long single mode waveguides at 1300 nm with integrated mirrors for off-plane coupling. - Coupling of the polymer waveguides to the <b>detachable</b> <b>connectors</b> delivered by the University of Mannheim. - Realisation of a first demonstrator comprising a 10 long optical backplane with two <b>detachable</b> optical <b>connectors.</b> (orig.)

40|$|Copyright © 2007 SAE International The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to present a new concept of adaptive crashworthiness system. Main objectives of the proposed system are to predict, control and adjust the impact characteristics to various conditions by decreasing the pre-designed crushing stiffness of the vehicle frontal deformation zone. According to the initial pre-crash parameters (velocity, mass, stiffness and overlap) the prospective system can select proper crushing force. In most basic approach each absorber has two levels of the crushing stiffness – high and low. De-stiffening feature is driven by pyrotechnic <b>detachable</b> <b>connectors</b> integrated in the frontal car structure, which can be destroyed causing disconnection of selected structural members, excluding them from the energy dissipation process. Pyrotechnical stiffness control can be activated in a very short time, sufficient to act during typical road accidents. Among other things, the presented idea can be used to solve mass compatibility problems. Results presented in this paper show that adaptive frontal structure can help in crash performance optimization, by adjusting system properties to the various conditions of impact scenario. Decrease of the front-end crash stiffness of a striking vehicle and extension of the crushing distance can decrease occupant risk through limited side intrusion and improved deceleration pulse shape, comparing to passive systems. Detailed procedures of the crash structural control are shown. Results of simulations performed in explicit finite element code and the experimental results are demonstrated. Sensing technology is not discussed...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Wearable technology has attracted global attention {{in the last decade}} and the market is experiencing an unprecedented growth. Wearable devices are designed to be low-profile, light-weight and integrated seamlessly into daily life. Comfort {{is one of the most}} important requirements for wearable devices. Fabric based antennas are soft, flexible and can be integrated into clothing. State of the art textile manufacturing techniques such as embroidery, combined with advanced conductive textile materials can be used to fabricate flexible fabric based on-body antennas. In this thesis, the feasibility of using computerised embroidery in the fabrication of wearable, flexible yet functional fabric based antennas have been examined. The fabric based antennas are embroidered using conductive threads. The most suitable materials for fabricating embroidered antennas have been identified. The embroidered fabric based antenna systems including transmission lines and low-profile <b>detachable</b> <b>connectors</b> have been fabricated and their RF performances have been tested. The optimal manufacturing parameters related to embroidery such as stitch direction, spacing and length have been examined. The repeatability of embroidered antennas, cost estimation, and complexity of manufacturing process have been clearly presented. The results can be used to inform and provide guidelines for the development of representative products that can be mass manufactured. A new simulation approach has been introduced to analyse the anisotropic properties of embroidered conductive threads. Simulations and measurements indicate that the performances of embroidered antennas are affected by the anisotropic surface current due to the embroidered stitches. Exploiting the current direction, a novel non-uniform meshed patch antenna has been designed. Representative results show that the non-uniform meshed structure can significantly reduce more than 75...|$|R
