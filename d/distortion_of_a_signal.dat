5000|$|In telecommunication, intersymbol {{interference}} (ISI) {{is a form}} of <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> in which one symbol interferes with subsequent symbols. This is an unwanted phenomenon as the previous symbols have similar effect as noise, thus making the communication less reliable. The spreading of the pulse beyond its allotted time interval causes it to interfere with neighboring pulses. ISI is usually caused by multipath propagation or the inherent non-linear frequency response of a channel causing successive symbols to [...] "blur" [...] together.|$|E
5000|$|Multipath {{interference}} (<b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> {{because it}} takes many different paths to the receiver with various phase shift and various polarisation shift) {{is a problem in}} narrowband technology. It also affects UWB transmissions, but according to the Shannon-Hartley theorem and the variety of geometries applying to various frequencies the ability to compensate is enhanced. Multipath causes fading, and wave interference is destructive. Some UWB systems use [...] "rake" [...] receiver techniques to recover multipath-generated copies of the original pulse to improve a receiver's performance. Other UWB systems use channel-equalization techniques to achieve the same purpose. Narrowband receivers may use similar techniques, but are limited due to the different resolution capabilities of narrowband systems.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} techniques for designing integrated amplifiers with high linearity. Amplifiers with operating frequencies from Audio to RF have been built. An enhanced feedback configuration, capable <b>of</b> very low <b>distortion,</b> is presented. Also presented is a statistical method for relating the <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wideband <b>signal</b> {{to the total}} harmonic <b>distortion</b> (THD) <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single tone. Two fully integrated class AB CMOS audio power amplifiers {{that are capable of}} driving 8 Ohm loudspeaker loads directly from the chip are presented. Two different topologies are used, both resulting in low distortion and high output voltage swing. The second amplifier operates with supply voltages down to 1. 5 V. Both amplifiers feature advanced phase compensation strategies to be able to drive loudspeakers with up to 100 nF and down to 8 Ohm without external components, such as load stabilising networks. Two wideband IF amplifiers are presented. They are fully integrated and have high linearity from DC to 20 MHz. Both have differential inputs and outputs. To achieve high linearity, large feedback together with double nested Miller compensation are used, resulting in <b>a</b> high degree <b>of</b> linearisation of the output stage. One of the amplifiers is built in CMOS and the other is built using npn-only bipolar technology. One fully integrated RF power amplifier in 0. 8 um CMOS without coils is presented. The purpose of this amplifier is to investigate how fast and linear a power amplifier can be made in CMOS, without using coils to resonate with major parasitic capacitances. This investigation is done {{in order to be able}} to build fast RF power amplifiers without coils when the speed of the CMOS processes increases in the future. An enhanced feedback scheme, which is the subject to a patent application, is also presented. By connecting a negative impedance to the inverting input <b>of</b> <b>a</b> feedback amplifier, the feedback can be boosted to become infinite at a certain frequency.

Interframe coding of LSF's can cause error propagation when frame erasures occur.

In this paper, we consider the erasure performance of LSF differential scalar quantizer (DSQ) and compare it with the interframe coding method embedded in the standard G 723. 1 of the ITU.

The article considers one of opportunities to improve the interface <b>of</b> <b>a</b> modern pilot's cabin i. e. to use a spatial sound (3 D - audio technology). The 3 D - audio is a technology, which recreates a spatially directed sound in earphones or via loudspeakers. Spatial audio-helps, which together with information on danger will specify also the direction from which it proceeds, can reduce time <b>of</b> response to <b>an</b> event and, therefore, increase situational safety of flight. It is supposed that helps will be provided through pilot's headset therefore technology realization via earphones is discussed. Now the main hypothesis explaining the human ability to recognize the position <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sound source in space, asserts that the human estimates <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sound <b>signal</b> spectrum at interaction with the head and an auricle depending on <b>an</b> arrangement <b>of</b> the sound source. For exact describing the signal spectrum variations there are such concepts as Head Related Impulse Response (HRIR) and Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF). HRIR is measured in humans or dummies. At present the most full-scale public HRIR library is CIPIC HRTF Database of CIPIC Interface Laboratory at UC Davis. To have 3 D audio effect, it is necessary to simulate a mono-signal conversion through the linear digital filters with anthropodependent pulse characteristics (HRIR) for the left and right ear, which correspond to the chosen direction. Results should be united in a stereo file and applied for reproduction to the earphones. This scheme was realized in Matlab, and the received software was used for experiments to estimate the quantitative characteristics of technology. For processing and subsequent experiments the following sound <b>signals</b> were chosen: <b>a</b> fragment <b>of</b> the classical music piece "Polovetsky Dancings" from A. P. Borodin's opera "Prince Igor", the horn sounds, the modulated broadband noise (with the fixed position, and "wandering" in the range ± 5 º in the vertical direction with respect to the fixed position). In the course of experiments the examinee was offered to define in what of possible positions (on an azimuth ± 80 º, ± 40 º, 0 º, on an eminence ± 45 º, 0 º, and 90 º - over the head) there is <b>a</b> virtual source <b>of</b> sound. According to results of experiments, directions with "rough" gradation 90 ° (in a horizontal "at the left–direct-on the right", in a vertical ""up-direct-down") are distinguished with he high probability (on the average 0. 94) for all types of signals. Thus the spectral content of signal is of no importance. Results of more accurate recognition with gradation of 40 … 45 ° depend on the type of signal and are different for horizontal and vertical channels. In the horizontal channel the probability of the correct recognition for broadband signals (the modulated noise, classical music) is 0, 77 … 0, 78, for <b>a</b> sound <b>of</b> horn it is 0, 75. In the vertical channel for broadband signals (the modulated noise, classical music) the probability of the correct recognition is 0. 48 … 0. 50, for <b>a</b> sound <b>of</b> horn it is 0. 36. The results allow us to assume that the person recognizes better the position of sound signal sources with rather wide spectrum close to the natural ones (broadband noise, symphonic orchestra). Thus, as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> the carried-out work the sound processing algorithms have been realized and the software to allow reproducing spatial audio-helps via earphones has been created. In the course of research the methods <b>of</b> <b>a</b> digital filtration as well the statistical methods to analyse the results of experiments have been used. The main result defining <b>a</b> scientific novelty <b>of</b> work is the objective quantitative characteristics of the 3 D - audio technology, which are expedient for considering in designing the interfaces for pilots' cabins of modern aircrafts. </p...|$|R
