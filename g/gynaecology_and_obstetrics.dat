25|$|<b>Gynaecology</b> <b>and</b> <b>Obstetrics</b> gained {{attention}} in the American medical field {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century through the development of such procedures as the ovariotomy.

25|$|Placental {{expulsion}} can {{be managed}} actively or it {{can be managed}} expectantly, allowing the placenta to be expelled without medical assistance. Active management is described as the administration of a uterotonic drug within one minute of fetal delivery, controlled traction of the umbilical cord and fundal massage after delivery of the placenta, followed by performance of uterine massage every 15 minutes for two hours. In a joint statement, World Health Organization, the International Federation of <b>Gynaecology</b> <b>and</b> <b>Obstetrics</b> and the International Confederation of Midwives recommend active management of the third stage of labour in all vaginal deliveries to help to prevent postpartum hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|In most medical programs, {{the first}} two years deal with basic {{scientific}} courses (cellular and molecular biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, mathematics, and physics), and the core medical sciences (anatomy, embryology, histology, physiology, and biochemistry). The following year may change in how it is organized in different schools, but is usually organ system-based pathophysiology and therapeutics (general and systems pathology, pharmacology, microbiology, parasitology, immunology, and medical genetics are also taught in this block). In {{the first two}} years, the programs also usually begin the courses in the epidemiology track (which may or may not include biostatistics), a clinical skills track (semiology and the clinical examination), a social medicine/public health track, and a medical ethics and communication skills track. Modes of training vary, but are usually based on lectures, simulations, standardized-patient sessions, problem-based learning sessions, seminars, and observational clinical experiences. By year three, most schools have begun the non-elective, clinical-rotation block with accompanying academic courses (these include {{but are not limited to}} internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, anaesthesiology, orthopaedics, <b>gynaecology</b> <b>and</b> <b>obstetrics,</b> emergency medicine, neurology, psychiatry, oncology, urology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, ophthalmology, and otorhinolaryngology). Elective rotations are usually introduced in the fourth or fifth year, though as in the case of the non-elective rotations, the hospitals the medical students may be placed in or apply to for a given rotation depend entirely on the medical schools. This is important in terms of the medical training, given the particular distinction of patients, pathologies, procedures, and skills seen and learned in private vs. public hospitals in Colombia. Most schools, however, have placements in both types of hospitals for many specialties.|$|E

Patients and methods: We carried out a retrospective study of all malformations of the eye and its adnexae observed among children aged 0 &ndash; 5 years who were seen at the ophthalmology unit from January 2003 to December 2009. Results: Out of the 2254 children who were examined, 150 (6. 65 %) presented eye malformations. The mean age was 14. 40 &plusmn; 4 months. Eye malformations were diagnosed in 71. 66 % of cases {{during the first year}} of life. The most frequent malformations were congenital lacrimal duct obstruction (66. 66 %), congenital cataract (10. 9 %), congenital glaucoma (10. 9 %), microphthalmos (5. 03 %), and congenital ptosis (3. 77 %). Conclusion: Eye malformations among children can lead to visual impairment and are a cause for discomfort to children and parents.

500|$|Fraser {{began her}} work in <b>gynaecology</b> <b>and</b> <b>obstetrics</b> in 1924, noting that the only internships {{available}} to her were in OBGYN or children's tonsillectomies. Much of her work required her to visit immigrant patients of the tenement houses of the Lower East Side. She had little understanding of the diverse ethnicities of her patients, their poverty and {{the conditions in which}} they lived. Fraser had been influenced by Eugenics studies, which caused her medical practices to be influenced by ethnic origin. She became convinced that there was inadequate information available about birth control available to both physicians and patients and she sought information from non-medical sources, becoming an advocate. Soon after her arrival in New York, Fraser began a more intense correspondence with Williams, who would become her life partner. Despite the desires of both women's families to keep them apart—Williams' family sending her to England and Fraser's family threatening that continuing the relationship would fracture her familial ties—the two refused to give up their relationship.|$|E

2500|$|The {{graduate}} degree of MBBS {{is divided into}} 3 professionals, with each professional ending with a professional exam conducted by the university (a single university may have up to dozens of medical colleges offering various graduate/post-graduate/post-doctoral degrees). After clearing this the student moves into the next professional. Each professional exam consists of a theory exam and a practical exam conducted {{not only by the}} same college but also external examiners. The exams are tough and many students are unable to clear them, thereby prolonging their degree time. The first professional is for 1 year and includes preclinical subjects, anatomy, physiology and biochemistry. The second professional is for 1 and a half year and has subjects pathology, pharmacology, microbiology (including immunology) and forensic medicine. Clinical exposure starts in the second professional. The third professional is divided into two parts. Part 1 consists of ophthalmology, ENT, and PSM (preventive and social medicine) and part 2 consists of general-medicine, general surgery [...] and pediatrics and <b>gynaecology</b> <b>and</b> <b>obstetrics</b> [...] This is followed by one-year of compulsory internship (rotatory house-surgeonship).

2500|$|The {{final year}} of medical school in Colombia is {{referred}} to as the internship year ("internado"). The internship year is usually divided into two semesters. The first semester is made up of obligatory rotations that every student does though in different orders, and the medical intern serves in 5-7 different specialties, typically including internal medicine, paediatrics, general surgery, anaesthesiology, orthopaedics, <b>gynaecology</b> <b>and</b> <b>obstetrics,</b> and emergency medicine. The extent of the responsibilities of the intern varies with the hospital, as does the level of supervision and teaching, but generally, medical interns in Colombia extensively take, write, and review clinical histories, answer and discuss referrals with their seniors, do daily progress notes for the patients under their charge, participate in the service rounds, present and discuss patients at rounds, serve shifts, assist in surgical procedures, and assist in general administrative tasks. Sometimes, they are charged with ordering diagnostic testing, but, under Colombian law they cannot prescribe medication as they are not graduate physicians. This, of course, are to be completed in addition to their academic responsibilities. The second semester is made up of elective rotations, which can be at home or abroad, in the form of clerkships or observerships. A final graduation requirement is to sit a standardized exam, the [...] ("Examen de Estado de Calidad de la Educación Superior" [...] or ECAES, also known as SABER PRO) specific to medicine, which tests, for example, knowledge in public health and primary care.|$|E
