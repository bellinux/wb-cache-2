25|$|One economist's {{analysis}} calculates that, despite increased overall spending, Christmas is a <b>deadweight</b> <b>loss</b> under orthodox microeconomic theory, {{because of}} the effect of gift-giving. This loss is calculated as the difference between what the gift giver spent on the item and what the gift receiver would have paid for the item. It is estimated that in 2001, Christmas resulted in a $4 billion <b>deadweight</b> <b>loss</b> in the U.S. alone. Because of complicating factors, this analysis is sometimes used to discuss possible flaws in current microeconomic theory. Other deadweight losses include the effects of Christmas on the environment and the fact that material gifts are often perceived as white elephants, imposing cost for upkeep and storage and contributing to clutter.|$|E
25|$|With {{the growth}} of the {{principle}} of user-pays, some have argued that student unions distort efficient behaviour and lead to sub-optimal decision-making.

50|$|Becker's insight was to {{recognize}} that <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses</b> put a brake on predation. He took the well-known insight that <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses</b> are proportional to {{the square of the}} tax, and used it to argue that a linear increase in takings by a predatory interest group will provoke a non-linear increase in the <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses</b> its victim suffers. These rapidly increasing losses will prod victims to invest equivalent sums in resisting attempts on their wealth. The advance of predators, fueled by linear incentives slows before the stiffening resistance of prey outraged by non-linear damages.|$|R
40|$|An {{environmental}} stewardship program, whereby {{farmers are}} paid directly {{for the environmental}} goods they provide, is developed by combining the microparameter distribution model with mechanism design principles. The program overcomes the information asymmetry between farmers and governments and accounts for the <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses</b> from distortionary taxes. The characteristics of optimal input and payment schedules of the program are derived. These optimal schedules {{are determined by the}} tradeoffs between farming profits, environmental benefits, and <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses</b> from taxes, and are second-best except under restrictive conditions on <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses</b> from taxes and on the marginal product of inputs and marginal pollution costs.

25|$|The {{higher costs}} to labour and capital imposed by income tax causes <b>deadweight</b> <b>loss</b> in an economy, being {{the loss of}} {{economic}} activity from people deciding not to invest capital or use time productively because of the burden that tax would impose on those activities. There is also a loss from individuals and professional advisors devoting time to tax-avoiding behaviour instead of economically-productive activities.|$|E
25|$|A VAT, {{like most}} taxes, distorts {{what would have}} {{happened}} without it. Because the price for someone rises, the quantity of goods traded decreases. Correspondingly, some people are worse off by more than the government is made better off by tax income. That is, more is lost due to supply and demand shifts than is gained in tax. This is known as a <b>deadweight</b> <b>loss.</b> If the income lost by the economy is greater than the government's income; the tax is inefficient. It must be noted that a VAT and a Non-VAT have the same implications on the microeconomic model.|$|E
25|$|<b>Deadweight</b> <b>loss</b> {{does not}} account for the effect taxes have in {{leveling}} the business playing field. Businesses that have more money are better suited to fend off competition. It is common that an industry {{with a small amount of}} very large corporations has a very high barrier of entry for new entrants coming into the marketplace. This is due to the fact that the larger the corporation, the better its position to negotiate with suppliers. Also, larger companies may be able to operate at low or even negative profits for extended periods of time, thus pushing out competition. More progressive taxation of profits, however, would reduce such barriers for new entrants, thereby increasing competition and ultimately benefiting consumers.|$|E
40|$|Why are trade {{barriers}} {{often used to}} protect home producers, even {{at the cost of}} introducing <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses</b> from higher commodity prices? We add an informational friction to the standard textbook argument in favor of free trade, and show that trade restrictions may be a more effcient policy than a lump sum transfer to the displaced producers. Trade barriers, while generating <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses,</b> have the benefit that they do not generate a need for compensation. When the policy maker does not know the amount that should be transferred, the risk of over- compensating may make trade barrier more efficient. Trade barriers, Distortionary policies...|$|R

This paper provides several {{estimates of the}} insurance and transfer share of the German public pension system. Estimating these shares is important because they are indicative of taxation-related <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses</b> and influence public acceptance of the pension system. We also disentangle intragenerational from intergenerational transfers. Although our estimate of intragenerational transfers is smaller than recent semi-official estimations, such transfers create substantial <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses.</b> Intergenerational transfers are much larger, thereby contributing to strong negative participation incentives for the younger generation.

40|$|A {{recent study}} {{of the welfare state}} in Sweden, Rosen (1995, 1996, 1997), concludes that child care {{subsidies}} may lead to substantial <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses</b> that may impede economic growth {{and the future of the}} welfare state. In this article we show that the <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses</b> are highly sensitive to some parameter restrictions implied by Rosen's theoretical model. We then critically review the relation between the parameter values in Rosen's model. Moreover, as a first approach to extend Rosen's model, we analyze the case of positive externalities associated with child quality. The positive externality provides a rationale for child care subsidies, as expected, and also influences the optimal income tax rate.

25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{negative}} externalities, the introduction of taxes into a market reduces economic efficiency by causing <b>deadweight</b> <b>loss.</b> In a competitive market {{the price of a}} particular economic good adjusts to ensure that all trades which benefit both the buyer and the seller of a good occur. The introduction of a tax causes the price received by the seller to be less than the cost to the buyer by the amount of the tax. This causes fewer transactions to occur, which reduces economic welfare; the individuals or businesses involved are less well off than before the tax. The tax burden and the amount of deadweight cost is dependent on the elasticity of supply and demand for the good taxed.|$|E

2500|$|High {{levels of}} {{conspicuous}} consumption {{may be seen}} as socially undesirable on two grounds; firstly, as it is often associated with high relative income, high levels of conspicuous consumption may be an indicator of high levels of income inequality, which may be found intrinsically or instrumentally objectionable; secondly conspicuous consumption differs from other forms of consumption in that the main reason for the purchase of positional goods is not due to the additional direct utility provided by the goods alleged high quality, but rather the social prestige associated with the consumption of that good. One downside of this search for status is that individual purchases of positional goods may at a social level be self-defeating due to external effects. In this case, the externality is status anxiety, the loss of social status suffered by people whose stock of high-status goods (positional goods) is diminished, in relation to the stocks of other conspicuous consumers, as they increase their consumption of high-status goods and services; effectively, status-seeking is a zero-sum game—by definition, the rise of one person in the social hierarchy can occur only {{at the expense of other}} people. Therefore, the conspicuous consumption of luxury goods and services (positional goods) is an economic loss—like competitive military spending (an arms race), [...] wherein each country must match the military expenditures of other countries in the arms race, or suffer a loss of relative military power. In the case of conspicuous consumption, taxes upon luxury goods diminish societal expenditures on high-status goods, by rendering them more expensive than non-positional goods. In this sense, luxury taxes can be seen as a market failure correcting [...] Pigovian tax—with an apparent negative <b>deadweight</b> <b>loss,</b> these taxes are a [...] more efficient mechanism for increasing revenue than 'distorting' labour or capital taxes.|$|E
30|$|The SIVP {{as it was}} {{analysed}} in {{this paper}} no longer exists. It was changed to some extent in 2009 and it will soon be phased out to make place for the Chèque d’Appui à l’Emploi – or the Employment Support Cheque. However, {{it is clear that}} this new programme is a direct descendant of the SIVP and, indeed, still bears many similarities to it. 26 In particular, the cheque’s targeting is no better than the SIVP’s, nor does it make training or any other employability programmes a compulsory requirement for receiving the subsidy (despite the fact that experience with subsidies in other countries has shown that they tend to be more effective if they are combined with other such interventions). It is a shame, therefore, that employment subsidies in Tunisia will, in all likelihood, continue to be provided in a wasteful manner, with large <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses.</b> This is not to say, of course, that <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses</b> are entirely avoidable – they are an inherent attribute of such programmes – just that <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses</b> are a question of degree, and can be reduced substantially if good practice in wage subsidy design is abided by.|$|R
40|$|The paper aims at {{assessing}} {{the costs and}} benefits of antitrust enforcement. The analysis starts with an investigation of why competition is typically worth protecting followed by a collection of empirical evidence which shows that competition actually needs protection by antitrust policy in order to hinder firms to permanently abuse market power to the detriment of consumers. Subsequently, an estimation of {{the costs and benefits}} of antitrust enforcement is undertaken for the United States and the Netherlands. The analysis differentiates between an aggregate level approach which basically focuses on <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses</b> and a disaggregate level approach which estimates the benefits of antitrust enforcement in particular antitrust cases and compares these figures with estimates of the costs of antitrust enforcement. The results basically show for the United States and the Netherlands that the realised benefits overtop the realised costs by far as long as overcharges/redistribution effects and <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses</b> are considered as welfare loss. However, if only the avoidance of <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses</b> is considered as benefit of antitrust policy, the benefits estimate for cartel and merger enforcement under a disaggregate approach cannot cover the derived cost estimate for the United States and the Netherlands.

50|$|Assuming {{the market}} is in a {{perfectly}} competitive equilibrium, a subsidy increases the supply of the good beyond the equilibrium competitive quantity.

This allocation, however, is sub-optimal with <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses</b> evaluated at around 0. 05 percent of a permanent shift in steady-state consumption.

The <b>deadweight</b> <b>losses</b> from the fiscal pressure caused by population ageing are equivalent to an annual loss of consumption of $ 260 per person per year in 2003 dollars in the balanced budget scenario. A feasible degree of tax smoothing would reduce this welfare loss by an equivalent of $ 70 per person per year. Unlike the extrapolation-based model, the CGE approach takes account of feedback effects of ageing-induced tax increases on consumption and labour supply, which in turn impact on the ultimate magnitude of fiscal pressure and therefore tax increases.
