As defined by DART, a deferred station <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been identified, but will not be constructed until land use changes warrant {{the construction of a}} station. In addition to the deferred stations, the network also features a single ghost station, the Knox–Henderson Station.

5|$|In the r/K-selection model, {{the first}} {{variable}} r is the intrinsic {{rate of natural increase}} in population {{size and the}} second variable K is the carrying capacity of a population. Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An r-selected species <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> high birth rates, low levels of parental investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of fecundity in r-selected species. Many kinds of insects and invasive species exhibit r-selected characteristics. In contrast, a K-selected species has low rates of fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and low rates of mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting K-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.|$|E
5|$|The soft organic {{material}} aboard and dispersed onto the seabed around the hull {{would have been}} the first to disappear, rapidly devoured by fish and crustaceans. Wood-boring molluscs such as Teredo colonized the ship's decks and interior in huge numbers, eating away the wooden decking and other wooden objects such as furniture, paneling, doors and staircase banisters. When their food ran out they died, leaving behind calcareous tubes. The question of the victims' bodies <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> often troubled explorers of the wreck site. When the debris field was surveyed in Robert Ballard's 1986 expedition, pairs of shoes were observed lying next to each other on the sea bed. The flesh, bones, and clothes had long since been consumed but the tannin in the shoes' leather had apparently resisted the bacteria, leaving the shoes as the only markers of where a body had once lain. Ballard has suggested that skeletons may remain deep within Titanics hull, such as in the engine rooms or third-class cabins. This has been disputed by scientists, who have estimated that the bodies would have completely disappeared by the early 1940s at the latest.|$|E

There are several tombstones in and about this church; the family of the Macneils, the principal possessors of this isle, are buried under the tombstones on the east side the church, where there is a plot of ground set apart for them.

25|$|The {{concept that}} video games are {{a form of}} art <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> begun to gain force in the later half of the 2000s with the U.S. National Endowment for the Arts {{recognizing}} games {{as a form of}} art in May 2011, for example. In viewing video games as cultural artifacts and the industry as a cultural industry, the disenfranchisement of women from the medium is regarded as negatively impacting the female voice in the industry and the woman's capacity {{to take part in the}} cultural dialogue that gaming inspires. From an education perspective, certain gaming genres particularly lacking in female players such as the first-person shooter game have been shown to increase spatial skills thereby giving advantages to players of the games that are currently skewed along gender lines. Video games have also been determined to provide an easy lead-in to computer literacy for children and correlations have been drawn between male video gaming and the predominance of male workers within the computer industry. With the increasing importance of tech jobs in the 21st century and the increased role of online networking, the lack of female video game players suggests a loss of future career opportunities for women.|$|E
25|$|Infinite helical symmetry: If {{there are}} no {{distinguishing}} features {{along the length of}} a helix or helix-like object, the object will have infinite symmetry much like that of a circle, but with the additional requirement of translation along the long axis of the object to return it to its original appearance. A helix-like object <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> at every point the regular angle of coiling of a helix, but which can also have a cross section of indefinitely high complexity, provided only that precisely the same cross section exists (usually after a rotation) at every point {{along the length of the}} object. Simple examples include evenly coiled springs, slinkies, drill bits, and augers. Stated more precisely, an object has infinite helical symmetries if for any small rotation of the object around its central axis there exists a point nearby (the translation distance) on that axis at which the object will appear exactly as it did before. It is this infinite helical symmetry that gives rise to the curious illusion of movement along the length of an auger or screw bit that is being rotated. It also provides the mechanically useful ability of such devices to move materials along their length, provided that they are combined with a force such as gravity or friction that allows the materials to resist simply rotating along with the drill or auger.|$|E
25|$|Kant opens section III by {{defining}} the will {{as the cause}} of our actions. According to Kant, having a will is the same thing as being rational, and having a free will means having a will that is not influenced by external forces. This is a negative definition of freedom – it tells us that freedom is freedom from determination by alien forces. But Kant also provides a positive definition of freedom: a free will, Kant argues, gives itself a law- it sets its own ends, and has a special causal power to bring them about. A free will <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> the power to bring about its own actions {{in a way that is}} distinct from the way that normal laws of nature cause things to happen. According to Kant, we need laws to be able to act. An action not based on some sort of law would be arbitrary and not the sort of thing that we could call the result of willing. Because a free will is not merely pushed around by external forces, external forces do not provide laws for a free will. The only source of law for a free will is that will itself. This is Kant's notion of autonomy. Thus, Kant's notion of freedom of the will requires that we are morally self legislating, that we impose the moral law on ourselves. Kant thinks that the positive understanding of freedom amounts to the same thing as the categorical imperative, and that “a free will and a will under moral laws are one and the same”. This is the key notion that later scholars call the reciprocity thesis. The reciprocity thesis states that a will is bound by the moral law if and only if it is free. That means that if you know that someone is free, then you know that the moral law applies to them, and vice versa.|$|E

500|$|In {{the reward}} system, reward is the {{attractive}} and motivational property of a stimulus that induces appetitive behavior [...] (also known as approach behavior) – and consummatory behavior. A rewarding stimulus <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> {{the potential to}} cause an approach to it and a choice {{to be made to}} consume it or not. Pleasure, learning (e.g., classical and operant conditioning), and approach behavior are the three main functions of reward. As an aspect of reward, pleasure provides a definition of reward; however, while all pleasurable stimuli are rewarding, not all rewarding stimuli are pleasurable (e.g., extrinstic rewards like money). The motivational or desirable aspect of rewarding stimuli is reflected by the approach behavior that they induce, whereas the pleasurable component of intrinstic rewards is derived from the consummatory behavior that ensues upon acquiring them. [...] A neuropsychological model which distinguishes these two components of an intrinsically rewarding stimulus is the incentive salience model, where [...] "wanting" [...] or desire (less commonly, [...] "seeking") corresponds to appetitive or approach behavior while [...] "liking" [...] or pleasure corresponds to consummatory behavior.}} In human drug addicts, [...] "wanting" [...] becomes dissociated with [...] "liking" [...] as the desire to use an addictive drug increases, while the pleasure obtained from consuming it decreases due to drug tolerance.|$|E
