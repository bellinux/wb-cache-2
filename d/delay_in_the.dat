5|$|Four minor {{stages of}} OCD have been {{identified}} after trauma. These include revascularization and formation of granulation (scar) tissue, absorption of necrotic fragments, intertrabecular osteoid deposition, and remodeling of new bone. With <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> revascularization stage, an OCD lesion develops. A lesion can lead to articular-surface irregularities, which in turn may cause progressive arthritic deterioration.|$|E
5|$|In March 1979 James Callaghan's Labour {{government}} fell, and {{a general}} election was called for 3 May. This led to a brief <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> start of the trial as Thorpe, who still had a following among North Devon Liberals, was adopted as their candidate in the election. Largely isolated from his party's national campaign, he lost the seat to his Conservative opponent by over 8,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August 2008, after a delay {{following}} Tropical Storm Fay, Atlantis was rolled {{from the}} Orbiter Processing Facility to the Vehicle Assembly Building, {{where it was}} mated to the external fuel tank and solid rocket booster stack. Problems were encountered during the mating process, and poor weather due to Hurricane Hanna caused a <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rollout of Atlantis to the launch pad, which is normally done seven days after rollover.|$|E
40|$|Linear {{stationary}} dynamical {{systems with}} multiple constant <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state are studied. Their relative and approximate controllability properties with constrained controls are discussed. Definitions {{of various types}} of controllability with constrained controls for systems with <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state are introduced. Some theorems concerning the relative and the approximate relative controllability with constrained controls for dynamical systems with <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state are established. Various types of constraints are considered. Numerical examples illustrate the theoretical analysis. An example of a real technical dynamical system is given to indicate one of possible practical applications of the theoretical results...|$|R

5|$|Ranking Democratic {{committee}} member Patrick Leahy objected to Republican {{use of a}} secret hold {{to slow down the}} Sotomayor nomination, and Leahy attributed that anonymous tactic to GOP reticence about publicly opposing a female Hispanic nominee. The prior month, Leahy had triggered a procedural <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> confirmation of fellow Second Circuit nominee Chester J. Straub—who, although advanced by Clinton and supported by Senator Moynihan, was considered much more acceptable by Republicans—in an unsuccessful effort to force earlier consideration of the Sotomayor confirmation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CSM {{caused by}} the fire enabled NASA {{to catch up on}} man-rating the LM and Saturn V. Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first {{unmanned}} flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed.|$|E
5|$|A {{copyright}} issue arose {{after the}} publication of letters written by Helena's sister, Princess Alice. In Germany, an edition of Alice's letters was published in 1883, by a Darmstadt clergyman called Carl Sell, who chose a selection of her letters made available to him by the Queen. When it was done, Helena wrote to Sell and requested permission to publish the German text into English, and it was granted, but without the knowledge of the publisher Dr Bergsträsser. In December 1883 Helena wrote to Sir Theodore Martin, a favoured royal biographer, informing him that Bergsträsser was claiming copyright of Alice's letters, and on that basis was demanding a <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> publication of the English edition. Martin acted as an intermediary between Helena and Bergsträsser, who claimed to have received many offers from English publishers, and that the chosen one would expect a high honorarium.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of Rivens development, {{publisher}} Brøderbund was facing falling revenues as development costs rose. Two years into the project, Cyan still had nothing they could show them. Brøderbund's stock dropped from $60 a share to $22 in 1996, because of a <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> publishing of Riven. The plan had been to ship the game {{in time for the}} 1996 holiday season; Riven was finally published on October 29, 1997. Even though Rivens sales were expected to be higher than any other game that holiday season, Brøderbund launched a $10million marketing campaign and developed a retail marketing partnership with Toshiba America. Anticipation for the game was high even among non-gamers, helped by web-based word of mouth and well-placed media coverage.|$|E
5|$|Both pavilions were {{scheduled}} to be unveiled on June 19, 2009. However, Hadid's pavilion was not ready in time; it had construction delays and a construction team change, which led to coverage of the <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Only its aluminum skeleton was available for public viewing on the scheduled date; the work was completed and unveiled on August 4, 2009. The van Berkel pavilion was temporarily closed for repairs August 10–14, due to unanticipated wear and tear. Both pavilions were dismantled after November 1, 2009; the materials from van Berkel's were recycled, while Hadid's was stored for possible exhibition elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Despite precautions, the {{post-production}} faced significant delays {{owing to}} the digital inter-mediation, increased work-load due to the 3-D and dubbed versions of the film, and delays in {{the completion of the}} visual effects. The post-production also faced budget constraints and witnessed an overuse of CGI according to the cinematographer. The delays left only two days for printing the film and sending it to theatres, generating significant anxiety over a possible <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> release. Khan subsequently kept strict tabs on the progress of work, and postponed his knee surgery to complete the film on time.|$|E

5|$|In February 1959, Hawker had {{completed}} practically {{all of the}} design work and thus passed the entirety of its manufacturing design work to the company's Experimental Design Office at Kingston, London. In April 1959, the Ministry of Supply formally issued a contract for {{the completion of a}} pair of P.1127 prototypes. However, there were critics amongst the Air Staff of the project, typically disliking the P.1127 for its subsonic speeds, favouring supersonic-capable aircraft instead; Mason attributes this as having caused considerable <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> issuing of a contract to Hawker. On 23 July 1959, Hawker authorised the application of maximum effort to complete the development of the P.1127.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} grass-court event, del Potro beat Thomas Johansson in two sets {{and reached the}} second round at the Queen's Club, where he lost to Nadal. He also reached the quarterfinals in Nottingham the {{following}} week; there he beat British qualifier Jamie Baker and Kunitsyn {{in the first two}} rounds, but lost to Ivo Karlović at the quarterfinal stage. At his inaugural Wimbledon Championships, he defeated Davide Sanguinetti in the first round, before losing to eventual champion Roger Federer in the second round, after a rain <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third set.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} obtain support from the Imperial Japanese Army for the Midway operation, the Imperial Japanese Navy agreed to support their {{invasion}} of the Aleutian Islands. The IJA wished to occupy the western Aleutians to place the Japanese home islands {{out of range of}} U.S. land-based bombers based in Alaska. The Japanese operations in the Aleutian Islands (Operation AL) removed yet more ships that could otherwise have augmented the force striking Midway. Whereas many earlier historical accounts considered the Aleutians operation as a feint to draw American forces away, early twenty-first century research has suggested that AL was intended to be launched simultaneously with the attack on Midway. A one-day <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sailing of Nagumo's task force resulted in Operation AL beginning a day before the Midway attack.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is addressing {{the causes and}} effects of project <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coal mining industry in South Africa. A literature review was conducted and {{it was found that}} the causes of delays are extensively researched <b>in</b> <b>the</b> construction industry with only limited reference to <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mining industry which are mainly risk based. The effects of delays are predominantly listed as timing and cost effects...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPart I of {{this paper}} studies a coupled {{mathematical}} system which provides a good model for important families of linear time-invariant hereditary systems: delay-differential equations, integro-differential equations, Volterra-Stieltjes integral equations, functional differential equations of retarded and neutral types, etc. Appropriate states are constructed and associated semigroups and abstract differential equations are obtained. In Part II we emphasize the structural operator approach as in Delfour and Manitius. Control operators {{are added to the}} coupled mathematical system allowing <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control variables. Again structural operators are introduced to define the state and obtain abstract differential equations without <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control variable as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> work of Vinter and Kwong. Finally observation operators are added which allow for <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> observation variable and <b>delayed</b> control variables <b>in</b> <b>the</b> observation equation. Again a new state and a state equations are constructed {{in such a way that}} no <b>delay</b> appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new observation operator thus generalizing the construction of A. Pritchard and D. Salamon...|$|R
5|$|Instead, Metternich stayed six months, entrusting {{his office}} in Vienna to his father. He set about using the marriage, and flattery, to renegotiate the terms set out at Schönbrunn. The {{concessions}} he won were trivial, however: a few trading rights, <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> payment of the war indemnity, restitution of some estates belonging to Germans in the Austrian service, including the Metternich family's, and the lifting of a 150,000 man limit on the Austrian army. The last was particularly welcomed {{as a sign of}} increased Austrian independence, although Austria could no longer afford an army greater than the limit prescribed.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 2010, Disney {{announced}} that the film would be released in the United States and Canada on May 20, 2011, following Columbia Pictures' announcement of a <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Spider-Man reboot and Paramount Pictures slating Thor for May 6, 2011. The film was released in IMAX 3D, as well as traditional 2D and IMAX format, with Dolby 7.1 surround sound. This film {{was also the first}} film to be released in the 4DX motion theaters in Mexico and in the Western Hemisphere, featuring strobe lights, tilting seats, blowing wind and fog and odor effects. It is available exclusively at select Cinépolis cinemas.|$|E
5|$|On May 4, 1925, Rossi sent {{a letter}} to Mint Director Robert J. Grant. Rossi noted that there had been some <b>delay</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{preparation}} of the design for the new half dollar, and that California Senator Samuel M. Shortridge had urged Rossi's committee to move forward without delay. Rossi enclosed sketches by California sculptor Joseph (Jo) Mora, with the promise that a finished design, and a model, would follow. Citizens' Committee members had selected Mora unanimously, feeling he was the one artist who could capture the spirit of what was being commemorated.|$|E

30|$|Motivated by <b>the</b> results {{obtained}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aforecited references, {{we are concerned}} in this paper with a fuzzy stochastic BAMN (see (2.1)) with discrete <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leakage terms, time-varying delays, and infinitely distributed <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> drift and diffusion terms. After proving {{the existence of an}} equilibrium state, we focus on proving the mean-square exponential stability of the network under consideration. The main contribution of this work is establishing a mean-square exponential stability property for fuzzy stochastic BAM neural networks incorporating discrete <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> leakage terms and incorporating continuous and infinitely distributed <b>delays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transmission terms. The novelty of our proof is in employing an integral transformation to recover the dissipation mechanism hidden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leakage terms and to design an elaborate Lyapunov–Krasovskii function to obtain the aforeclaimed mean-square exponential stability.|$|R
