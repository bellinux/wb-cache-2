When the player receives a phone call <b>from</b> <b>somebody,</b> the player can choose to answer or ignore the call.

Depending on the player's choices on how to respond to these phone calls and text messages, the plot will progress in a specific direction.|$|E

[...] She acknowledged to the Herald Sun that it was helpful to have Gibson's production company assist with her music career, [...] "If you think about it, every talent needs a serious push and help <b>from</b> <b>somebody</b> who is stronger, because it's pretty much impossible for anybody to succeed in this industry. So I've become very lucky, and I'm very grateful. You don't control the situations or the people you meet. I did not plan this. I'm just doing what I've always been doing.

500|$|Reports {{arose in}} the media that the ticket sales for the tour were falling, leading Arthur Fogel, Chairman of Live Nation's Global Touring division, to brand them as [...] "ridiculous". He {{clarified}} to Billboard that the about 80% of the tickets were sold in North America and Europe, and {{they were still in}} the process of releasing future dates for numerous venues. The 29 shows in North America had grossed around US $26 million, with an average of almost $900,000 per show. Fogel also addressed concerns that Live Nation had lost $30 million from Gaga's tour, saying that if a similar situation really happened, then the company would have cancelled the concerts. [...] "I just don't know how this shit gets any traction without people doing their homework... Just a complete fool would say something like that and it could only come <b>from</b> <b>somebody</b> who has an agenda, because it makes absolutely no sense, on any level", Fogel concluded. A total of 800,000 tickets have been sold for the tour, as reported by Billboard.|$|E
500|$|Saadiq {{recorded}} {{mostly at}} Blakeslee Recording Company; Additional sessions {{took place at}} Harmonie Park Studios in Detroit and The Music Shed Studios in New Orleans. While recording, he immersed himself in a composite character of classic soul singers from videos he watched, including Al Green, Gladys Knight & the Pips, the Four Tops, and the Temptations. He recorded his vocals with only Brungardt present in the studio, a preference he felt prevented him from [...] "looking for answers <b>from</b> <b>somebody</b> who may not really know". Saadiq said he tended to [...] "record complete takes, and if something isn't quite right but it's got a feel that I know I can never ever capture again, I'll leave it, even if it's flat. I mean, there are flat parts on my record, because it's not about perfection, it's about the soul." [...] He recorded background vocals for all songs. Saadiq played most of the instruments, including drums, guitar, piano, sitar, and bass guitar, his instrument of choice throughout his career. He viewed the bass playing of James Jamerson {{as an integral part}} of Motown recordings, citing it as the inspiration for his own bass sound on the album.|$|E

Mervyn Watson, former executive producer of Casualty, has commented on the origins of the idea to fully cross the two shows over for the first time: [...] "I think the idea came <b>from</b> <b>somebody</b> in the comedy department, who casually said to the Controller of Drama 'Wouldn't it be a good idea if...' The Controller did {{think it was a good}} idea, spoke to myself and Holby's executive producer, got it commissioned by the Head of BBC One and the rest is history." ...|$|E

Dammeier likened the department's actions to going to the post office to get letters sent to Quon instead of his house. Scalia pointed out that Quon could have obtained hard copies of the messages and circulated them himself. [...] "hen I get a piece of mail <b>from</b> <b>somebody,</b> I could do that as well", the lawyer replied, [...] "but that doesn't mean that the government gets to go to the post office and get my mail before I get it".

2500|$|Other critics laud {{the use of}} plot {{twists and}} {{surprise}} endings. Maurice Richardson wrote a rhapsodic review in The Observers issue of 5 November 1939 which began, [...] "No wonder Agatha Christie's latest has sent her publishers into a [...] trance. We will refrain, however, from any invidious comparisons with Roger Ackroyd and be content with saying that Ten Little Niggers {{is one of the}} very best, most genuinely bewildering Christies yet written. We will also have to refrain from reviewing it thoroughly, as it is so full of shocks that even the mildest revelation would spoil some surprise <b>from</b> <b>somebody,</b> and I am sure that you would rather have your entertainment kept fresh than criticism pure." [...] After stating the set-up of the plot, Richardson concluded, [...] "Story telling and characterisation are right at the top of Mrs Christie's baleful form. Her plot may be highly artificial, but it is neat, brilliantly cunning, soundly constructed, and free from any of those red-herring false trails which sometimes disfigure her work." ...|$|E

2500|$|Obama and Clinton {{were in a}} {{statistical}} dead heat in Texas, according to a poll released February 25, 2008. During Obama's sweep of February's post-Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses, the March 4 primaries of Texas and Ohio were seen as a firewall for the Clinton campaign. In early polls for these states, Clinton held double digit leads in polls for those states, {{but by the end}} of February Obama had started to erode Clinton's lead in her key demographics, and her lead had been reduced to single digits in some polls. In response to Obama's increases, Clinton's campaign began to increase their attacks on him, including an accusation of plagiarism due to similarities in Obama's campaign speeches and campaign speeches of Obama's campaign's national co-chair and Massachusetts governor, Deval Patrick, although Patrick specifically stated he told Obama to use it. During the February 21, CNN-Univision debate in Austin, Texas Obama responded to the accusation by saying, [...] "The notion that I had plagiarized <b>from</b> <b>somebody</b> who's one of my national co-chairs, who gave me the line and suggested that I use it, I think is silly." [...] Clinton received a round of boos from the crowd when she responded, [...] "Lifting whole passages from someone else's speeches is not change you can believe in; it's change you can Xerox." ...|$|E
