5|$|A central {{principle}} of mainstream economics is that trade can make everyone better off through comparative advantage and efficiency gains from specialization and greater efficiency. Many feminist economists question this claim.

They and other feminist economists explore whose interests specific trade practices serve.|$|E

5|$|Central to feminist {{economics}} {{is an effort}} to alter the theoretical modeling of the economy, to reduce gender bias and inequity. Feminist macroeconomic inquiries focus on international capital flows, fiscal austerity, deregulation and privatization, monetary policy, <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> more. In general, these modifications take three main forms: gender disaggregation, the addition of gender-based macroeconomic variables, {{and the creation of a}} two-sector system.|$|E
5|$|Exports {{and imports}} by air in 2005 were {{estimated}} at £62.7billion and £59.6billion respectively, {{with a significant}} majority of air freight operations being conducted with countries outside of the EU, and express freight operations transporting 5 per cent by value of all UK exports in 2004. Whilst export/import facilities provide opportunities for <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> competition, they are not without negative effect, and British horticulture {{is one example of}} domestic industry damaged by cheap imports.|$|E

5|$|In 64 BCE, the {{military}} expedition of the Roman general Pompey {{put an end}} to the anarchy prevailing in the Seleucid Empire, and Phoenicia became part of the Roman world. But Roman civil wars continued to disrupt the region until 31 BCE, after which, with the reign of Augustus, the pax romana extended over the area. The pax romana favored <b>international</b> <b>trade,</b> <b>and</b> local industries in silversmithing, glass, textiles and ceramics developed.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{economic}} foundations of Byzantium was trade, fostered by the maritime character of the Empire. Textiles must have been {{by far the most}} important item of export; silks were certainly imported into Egypt, and appeared also in Bulgaria, and the West. The state strictly controlled both the internal and the <b>international</b> <b>trade,</b> <b>and</b> retained the monopoly of issuing coinage, maintaining a durable and flexible monetary system adaptable to trade needs.|$|E

5|$|The city is {{the seat}} of San Diego County and is the {{economic}} center of the region {{as well as the}} San Diego–Tijuana metropolitan area. San Diego's main economic engines are military and defense-related activities, tourism, <b>international</b> <b>trade,</b> <b>and</b> manufacturing. The presence of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), with the affiliated UCSD Medical Center, has helped make the area a center of research in biotechnology.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th {{century the}} reach and {{influence}} of the Burgundian princes meant that the Low Countries' merchant and banker classes were in the ascendancy. The early to mid-century saw great rises in <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> domestic wealth, leading to an enormous increase in the demand for art. Artists from the area attracted patronage from the Baltic coast, the north German and Polish regions, the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and the powerful families of England and Scotland. At first, masters had acted as their own dealers, attending fairs where they could also buy frames, panels and pigments. The mid-century saw the development of art dealership as a profession; the activity became purely commercially driven, dominated by the mercantile class.|$|E
5|$|Other major {{employers}} {{in the county}} include: BAE Systems, Sunseeker International, J.P. Morgan, Cobham plc and Bournemouth University. Dorset's three ports, Poole, Weymouth and Portland, and the smaller harbours of Christchurch, Swanage, Lyme Regis, Wareham and West Bay generate {{a substantial amount of}} <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> tourism. Around 230 fishing vessels that predominantly catch crab and lobster are based in Dorset's ports. When the waters around Weymouth and Portland were chosen for the sailing events in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, the area underwent an increased investment in infrastructure and a growth in the marine leisure sector. It is expected that this will continue to {{have a positive effect on}} local businesses and tourism.|$|E

In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom's broadcasting industry.|$|E
5|$|As the Allied victory {{began to}} look certain, Keynes was heavily involved, {{as leader of the}} British {{delegation}} and chairman of the World Bank commission, in the mid-1944 negotiations that established the Bretton Woods system. The Keynes-plan, concerning an international clearing-union, argued for a radical system for the management of currencies. He proposed the creation of a common world unit of currency, the bancor, and new global institutions – a world central bank and the International Clearing Union. Keynes envisaged these institutions managing an <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> payments system with strong incentives for countries to avoid substantial trade deficits or surpluses. The USA's greater negotiating strength, however, meant that the final outcomes accorded more closely to the more conservative plans of Harry Dexter White. According to US economist J. Bradford DeLong, on almost every point where he was overruled by the Americans, Keynes was later proved correct by events.|$|E
5|$|In November 1380, Parliament {{was called}} {{together}} again in Northampton. Archbishop Simon Sudbury, the new Lord Chancellor, updated the Commons on the worsening situation in France, a collapse in <b>international</b> <b>trade,</b> <b>and</b> {{the risk of}} the Crown having to default on its debts. The Commons were told that the colossal sum of £160,000 was now required in new taxes, and arguments ensued between the royal council and Parliament about what to do next. Parliament passed a third poll tax (this time on a flat-rate basis of 12 pence on each person over 15, with no allowance made for married couples) which they estimated would raise £66,666. The third poll tax was highly unpopular and many in the south-east evaded it by refusing to register. The royal council appointed new commissioners in March 1381 to interrogate local village and town officials in an attempt to find those who were refusing to comply. The extraordinary powers and interference of these teams of investigators in local communities, primarily in the south-east and east of England, raised still further the tensions surrounding the taxes.|$|E

5|$|Raonic {{was born}} on December 27, 1990, in Titograd, SFR Yugoslavia (now Podgorica, Montenegro), and is of Serb heritage. Prompted by the {{political}} unrest in the Balkans, and seeking more professional opportunities, {{his family moved to}} Canada in 1994 when he was three, settling in Brampton, Ontario. His parents are both engineers; his father, Dušan, holds a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, while his mother, Vesna, has degrees in mechanical and computer engineering, including a master's. He has two siblings, both significantly older: his sister, Jelena, has a master's degree in <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> finance and is eleven years older, while his brother, Momir, has a degree in information technology and business and is nine years older. Raonic's uncle, Branimir Gvozdenović, is a politician in the Government of Montenegro, where he has served as Deputy Prime Minister. Raonic is fluent in Serbian and English.|$|E
5|$|Slow {{transportation}} and food preservation techniques (based on drying, salting, smoking and pickling) made long-distance trade of many foods very expensive. Because of this, the nobility food was {{more prone to}} foreign influence than the cuisine of the poor; it was dependent on exotic spices and expensive imports. As each level of society imitated the one above it, innovations from <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> foreign wars from the 12th century onwards gradually disseminated through the upper middle class of medieval cities. Aside from economic unavailability of luxuries such as spices, decrees outlawed consumption of certain foods among certain social classes and sumptuary laws limited conspicuous consumption among the nouveaux riches. Social norms also dictated that the food {{of the working class}} be less refined, since it was believed there was a natural resemblance between one's labour and one's food; manual labour required coarser, cheaper food.|$|E
5|$|The global {{financial}} {{system is the}} worldwide framework of legal agreements, institutions, and both formal and informal economic actors that together facilitate international flows of financial capital for purposes of investment and trade financing. Since emerging in the late 19th century during the first modern wave of economic globalization, its evolution is marked by the establishment of central banks, multilateral treaties, and intergovernmental organizations aimed at improving the transparency, regulation, and effectiveness of international markets. In the late 1800s, world migration and communication technology facilitated unprecedented growth in <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> investment. At the onset of World War I, trade contracted as foreign exchange markets became paralyzed by money market illiquidity. Countries sought to defend against external shocks with protectionist policies and trade virtually halted by 1933, worsening {{the effects of the}} global Great Depression until a series of reciprocal trade agreements slowly reduced tariffs worldwide. Efforts to revamp the international monetary system after World War II improved exchange rate stability, fostering record growth in global finance.|$|E
