40|$|Abstract—The {{current trends}} in service {{consolidation}} over Internet Protocol (IP) also stimulates {{the integration of}} the industrial automation system with the information technology (IT) infrastructure for more efficient information access and more cost-effective production and management. Field buses have been the de facto communication standard in industrial automation, but mostly based on manufacture-specific protocols. Thus, the interoperability between the manufacturer-specific <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> systems and the external operating environment is the critical factor in enabling the networked industrial automation systems. However, most of the existing <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> integration solutions lack either flexibility or scalability. In this paper, we propose a service-oriented architecture (SOA) based <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> integration architecture (SOAFBIA), where each <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> system is encapsulated with optional interface, manageability interface, and semantic descriptions in a stand format to facilitate interoperability.

40|$|In {{process and}} systems engineering, <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> systems must meet certain conditions. Not only function-related {{properties}} but frequently also safety regulations must be complied with. In hazardous areas of chemical, petrochemical and sewage treatment plants, {{the type of}} protection 'Intrinsic Safety' is frequently used, which is superior to other protection concepts in terms of construction and ease of handling. The manufacturers of measuring and control equipment and the users of equipment in hazardous areas are therefore most interested in advantageously using the type of protection 'Intrinsic Safety' also for <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> systems. To achieve this, a concept had {{to be worked out}} which allows a simple configuration and interconnection of the different components to be realized as independently as possible of the present state of standardization which is still unstable. The Intrinsic Safety concept for <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> systems described in this publication is designated as FISCO (<b>Field</b> <b>bus</b> Intrinsically Safe COncept).

A single Datacon <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> supports up to 256 devices on a multidrop RG 62 A/U coaxial cable with up to 33 devices or 2, 000 feet between repeaters or buffered branches.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} two {{important}} concerns in decentralized control: (1) communication over <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> and (2) {{the transition from}} a single powerful, centralized controller to many smaller, distributed controllers.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{technique}} for the combined voltage scaling of processors and communication links, taking into account dynamic as well as leakage power consumption.

We also introduce a set of accurate communication models for the energy estimation of voltage scalable embedded systems. In particular, we demonstrate that voltage scaling of <b>bus</b> <b>repeaters</b> and dynamic adaption of the voltage swing on fat wires can significantly influence the system’s energy consumption.

Despite {{the advantages of the}} MVB <b>field</b> <b>bus,</b> many vehicle buses are still built from CANopen, WorldFIP (in France), LonWorks (in the USA) and Profibus components. While the WorldFIP, CANopen, Lonworks and Profinet are controlled by international manufacturer associations targeting a wide range of application, MVB was tailored to the rolling stock application, with the goal of plug-compatibility, and therefore allows no options. This was intentional as the fight between the <b>field</b> <b>busses</b> raged in the 1990's and the decision of the IEC that any of the eight <b>field</b> <b>busses</b> was a standard did not help plug-compatibility. MVB modules are more expensive than for instance CANopen or LonWorks components. This is not due to the communication technology: most devices implement the MVB protocol machine in a small area of an FPGA which is today anyhow present, and the costliest component remains the connector. But railways certification is costly and not always needed for uncritical applications such as comfort and passenger information. When total cost of ownership is considered, the cost of the hardware elements can easily be outweighed by additional engineering costs in the railways market with its small series.|$|R
