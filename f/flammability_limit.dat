The flammability range is delineated by the upper and lower flammability limits. Outside this range of air/vapor mixtures, the mixture can not be ignited (unless the temperature and pressure are increased). The LFL decreases with increasing temperature; thus, a mixture that is below its LFL at a given temperature may be ignitable if heated sufficiently. For liquids, the LFL is typically close to the saturated vapor concentration at the flash point, however, due to differences in the liquid properties, the relationship of LFL to flash point (which is also dependent on the test apparatus) is not fixed and some spread in the data usually exists.|$|E

It was found that even with very small mass loadings (0.1%), large gains in heat transfer can be achieved (40%). Therefore, it is feasible to use the available hydrogen as a carrier for the particles. Care must be taken to ensure that the hydrogen content stays below the lean <b>flammability</b> <b>limit</b> to prevent uncontrolled ignition before reaching the combustor. A 1:1 mass ratio mixture of nanoparticles and hydrogen will be injected into freestream to achieve 0.1% mass loading of nanoparticles and hydrogen in air.

50|$|In {{many modern}} cars the fuel pump is usually {{electric}} and located inside the fuel tank. The pump creates positive {{pressure in the}} fuel lines, pushing the gasoline to the engine. The higher gasoline pressure raises the boiling point. Placing the pump in the tank puts the component least likely to handle gasoline vapor well (the pump itself) farthest from the engine, submersed in cool liquid. Another benefit to placing the pump inside the tank {{is that it is}} less likely to start a fire. Though electrical components (such as a fuel pump) can spark and ignite fuel vapors, liquid fuel will not explode (see <b>flammability</b> <b>limit)</b> and therefore submerging the pump in the tank is one of the safest places to put it. In most cars, the fuel pump delivers a constant flow of gasoline to the engine; fuel not used is returned to the tank. This further reduces the chance of the fuel boiling, since it is never kept close to the hot engine for too long.|$|E

50|$|The FAA did not {{consider}} lightweight inerting systems for commercial jets until the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800. The crash was blamed on {{an explosion in the}} center wing fuel tank of the Boeing 747 used in the flight. This tank is normally used only on very long flights, and little fuel was present in the tank {{at the time of the}} explosion. A small amount of fuel in a tank is more dangerous than a large amount, since heat entering the fuel tank with residual fuel causes the fuel to increase in temperature faster and evaporate. This causes the ullage fuel-to-air ratio to increase rapidly and exceed the lower <b>flammability</b> <b>limit.</b> A large quantity of fuel (high mass loading) in the fuel tank can retain the heat energy and slow the fuel evaporation rate. The explosion of a Thai Airways International Boeing 737 in 2001 and a Philippine Airlines 737 in 1990 also occurred in a tank that had residual fuel. All the above three explosions occurred on a warm day, in the center wing tank (CWT) that is within the contours of the fuselage. These fuel tanks are located in the vicinity of external equipment that heats the fuel tanks. The National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) final report on the crash of TWA 747 concluded “The fuel air vapor in the ullage of the TWA flight 800 CWT was flammable at the time of the accident.” NTSB identified “Elimination of Explosive Mixture in Fuel tanks in Transport Category Aircraft” as Number 1 item on its Most Wanted List in 1997.|$|E
50|$|The {{flammability}} limits (4-75% {{of hydrogen}} in air at normal temperature, wider at high temperatures), its autoignition temperature at 571 °C, its very low minimum ignition energy, and its tendency to form explosive mixtures with air, require provisions {{to be made}} for maintaining the hydrogen content within the generator above the upper or below the <b>flammability</b> <b>limit</b> at all times, and other hydrogen safety measures. When filled with hydrogen, overpressure has to be maintained as inlet of air into the generator could cause a dangerous explosion in confined space. The generator enclosure is purged before opening it for maintenance, and before refilling the generator with hydrogen. During shutdown, hydrogen is purged by an inert gas, then the inert gas is replaced by air; the opposite sequence is used before startup. Carbon dioxide or nitrogen can be used for this purpose, as they do not form combustible mixtures with hydrogen and are inexpensive. Gas purity sensors are used to indicate the end of the purging cycle, which shortens the startup and shutdown times and reduces consumption of the purging gas. Carbon dioxide is favored as due to the very high density difference it easily displaces the hydrogen. The carbon dioxide is admitted {{to the bottom of the}} generator first, pushing the hydrogen out at the top. Then air is admitted to the top, pushing the carbon dioxide out at the bottom. Purging is best done with the generator stopped. If done on barring, the generator fans will mix the gases and greatly increase the time required to achieve purity.|$|E
40|$|<b>Flammability</b> <b>limit</b> {{is a most}} {{significant}} property of substances to ensure safety of chemical processes and fuel application. Although there are numerous flammability literature data available for pure substances, for fuel mixtures these are not always available. Especially, for fuel mixture storage, operation, and transportation, inert gas inerting and blanketing have been widely applied in chemical process industries while the related date are even more scarce. Lower and upper flammability limits of hydrocarbon mixtures in air with and without additional nitrogen were measured in this research. Typically, the fuel mixture lower <b>flammability</b> <b>limit</b> almost keeps constant at different contents of added nitrogen. The fuel mixture upper <b>flammability</b> <b>limit</b> approximately linearly varies with the added nitrogen except mixtures containing ethylene. The minimum added nitrogen concentration at which lower <b>flammability</b> <b>limit</b> and upper <b>flammability</b> <b>limit</b> merge together is the minimum inerting concentration for nitrogen, roughly falling into the range of 45 plus/minus 10 vol % for all the tested hydrocarbon mixtures. Numerical analysis of inert gas dilution effect on lower <b>flammability</b> <b>limit</b> and upper <b>flammability</b> <b>limit</b> was conducted by introducing the parameter of inert gas dilution coefficient. Fuel mixture <b>flammability</b> <b>limit</b> can be quantitatively characterized using inert gas dilution coefficient plus the original Le Chatelier's law or modified Le Chatelier's law. An extended application of calculated adiabatic flame temperature modeling was proposed to predict fuel mixture flammability limits at different inert gas loading.

The present work focuses on measurements of concentration and temperature flammability limits of four pure hydrocarbon fuels, as well as traditional and alternative aviation fuels, including Jet-A, HEFA, SIP, and FT-S 8. The lower and upper concentration flammability limits of these selected fuels were determined under specific temperatures and pressures. An experiment including a customized power supply system to generate sufficient spark energy for ignition near the flammability limits was built to measure the lower and upper limits. The temperature flammability limits were also measured using a different experimental apparatus for the four selected aviation fuels. As the initial temperature increases, the lower concentration <b>flammability</b> <b>limit</b> decreases. In terms of the fuel-air mass ratio, the limit is {{within the range of}} 0. 032 - 0. 04 for all four aviation fuels.

Attention {{is paid to}} the combined effect of radiative heat loss and stretch at low stretch rate. It is found that for a mixture at an equivalence ratio lower than the standard lean <b>flammability</b> <b>limit,</b> a moderate stretch can strengthen the combustion and allow burning. The flame is extinguished at a high stretch rate due to stretch and is quenched at a low stretch rate due to radiation loss. A O-shaped curve of flame temperature versus stretch rate with two distinct extinction limits, a radiation extinction limit and a stretch extinction limit respectively on the left- and right-hand sides, is obtained. A C-shaped curve showing the <b>flammability</b> <b>limit</b> of the stretched methane 2 ̆ 013 air flame is obtained by plotting these two extinction limits in the mixture strength coordinate. A good agreement is shown on comparing the predicted results with the experimental data.

A detailed literature review of laminar burning velocity and <b>flammability</b> <b>limits</b> of biogas mixtures combustion is presented. Biogas alone and in mixtures with other fuels is particularly significant because of its capability of application as fuels for internal combustion engines (ICEs). Therefore, a strict determination of the fundamental combustion characteristics required for their application in ICEs is crucial. Producing energy from biogas has the additional benefit of preventing its release into the atmosphere, where it results into significant air pollution. The CH 4 and CO 2 are the main compounds of biogases, such as landfill, agricultural and sewage gas, after {{the removal of the}} trace amounts of organic compounds. For the same equivalence ratio, the presence of CO 2 in the fuel feed results in substantial reduction of the laminar flame speed and <b>flammability</b> <b>limits.</b> Several research projects have shown that the decrease in the laminar flame speed of a fuel mixture containing dilution components is caused by the increase in specific heat capacity and the decrease in heat release, flame temperature and thermal diffusivity.

The elimination of buoyancy under microgravity is essential for the exact determination of the <b>flammability</b> <b>limit</b> and the burning velocity and furthermore allows the analysis of flame instabilities. First the lean <b>flammability</b> <b>limit</b> for upward combustion of methane was determined by the pressure increase inside the combustion chamber for pressures up to 70 bar under normal gravity. The chamber was equipped with an optical access which was used for filming the combustion in the microgravity experiments. These experiments were conducted at the Bremen drop tower which allows 4, 7 sec microgravity. In the experiments the combustion chamber was first filled with a predefined methane air mixture which was then ignited by a spark. The combustion was then filmed by a high speed camera with schlieren optics. These films were used to determine the flame speeds and the burning velocity. The burning velocity for mixtures close to the <b>flammability</b> <b>limit</b> were ca. 1 mm/s. The <b>flammability</b> <b>limit</b> under microgravity is leaner than under normal conditions. Furthermore flame front instabilities were observed.

Experiments were performed at pressures of 5 and 10 bar, with gas temperatures between 25 and 300 °C and with the wire fixed horizontally and vertically. Three different phenomena are observed: negligible reaction, local reaction, and explosion. The negligible reaction region occurs at power supply rates to the wire below a critical value. Above this critical value either a local reaction or an explosion occurs.
