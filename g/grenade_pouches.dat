50|$|In 1956 the US Army {{employed}} {{several types}} of cartridge belts for soldiers armed with the M1 Garand, BAR belts for those armed with the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, 3- and 5-cell pockets for those armed with sub-machine guns, a pocket for 15 round M1 Carbine and M2 magazines, and two different pockets for the 30 round magazines, in addition to 2- and 3-cell <b>grenade</b> <b>pouches.</b> The M1956 Small Arms Ammunition case sought to replace all of these {{with a pair of}} simple pouches capable of holding either a 6-pocket M1 bandoleer of M1 Garand enbloc clips (8-rounds each; total of 48 rounds), 8 x M1 Garand enbloc clips (8 rounds each; total of 64 rounds), 2 x BAR magazines (20-rounds), 4 x M1 or M2 carbine magazines (30-round), 3 x 40mm M79 grenades, or 2 x M26 hand grenades plus 2 x hand grenades fastened {{on the sides of the}} case.|$|E
50|$|The grenade was {{composed}} of three separate pieces that were stored in different crates until use: the warhead and sleeve, spring-loaded handle, and fuze tube. They were assembled and issued only before combat. The warhead and handle were screwed together and carried in a <b>grenade</b> <b>pouch</b> and the fuzes were wrapped in waxed paper and carried separately in the pouch's internal pocket. There was {{a hole in the}} outer handle {{to the right of the}} thumb catch that lined up with bars of paint on the inner handle, making a colored dot - a white dot meant safe and a red dot meant the handle assembly was cocked. It would not be armed unless the fuze tube had been inserted, which would be done only before throwing.|$|R
