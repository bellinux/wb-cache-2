5|$|Before the {{publication}} of Industrial Society and <b>Its</b> <b>Future,</b> Ted Kaczynski's brother, David Kaczynski, was encouraged by his wife Linda {{to follow up on}} suspicions that Ted was the Unabomber. David was at first dismissive, but began to take the likelihood more seriously after reading the manifesto a week after it was published in September 1995. He browsed through old family papers and found letters dating back to the 1970s written by Ted and sent to newspapers protesting the abuses of technology and which contained phrasing similar to that found in Industrial Society and <b>Its</b> <b>Future.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{future is}} a {{well-known}} programming construct used to introduce concurrency into sequential programs. Computations annotated as futures are executed asynchronously and run concurrently with their continuations. Typically, futures are not transparent annotations: a program with futures need not produce the same result as the sequential program from which it was derived. Safe futures guarantee that a future-annotated program produces the same result as its sequential counterpart. The safety property is trivially satisfied in languages without side-effects or exceptions. In the presence of mutable references and language abstractions, such as exceptions, which permit the expression of non-local control-flow, ensuring safety requires that the future-annotated program adhere to control and data dependences imposed by the program’s sequential counterpart. In this paper, we present a formulation of safe futures for a higher-order functional language with first-class references and exceptions. Safety can be guaranteed at runtime by blocking a continuation from performing a potentially unsafe action before <b>its</b> <b>futures</b> have completed. To enable greater concurrency, we develop a static analysis and instrumentation and formalize the runtime behavior for instrumented programs that allows a continuation to proceed before <b>its</b> <b>futures</b> complete, as long as its actions are determined to be safe. A continuation’s action is safe {{if it is not}} control or data dependent on actions that may subsequently be performed by <b>its</b> <b>futures...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal {{design of a}} futures hedge program for a risk-averse multinational firm (MNF) under exchange rate uncertainty. All currency futures contracts are marked to market and require interim cash settlement of gains and losses. The MNF commits to prematurely liquidating <b>its</b> <b>futures</b> position on which the interim loss incurred exceeds a threshold level (i. e., the liquidation threshold). When the liquidation threshold is exogenously given, we show that the MNF optimally opts for an under-hedge (an over-hedge) should the futures exchange rates be not too (sufficiently) positively autocorrelated. When the liquidation threshold is endogenously determined, we show that the MNF voluntarily chooses to prematurely liquidate <b>its</b> <b>futures</b> position only if the futures exchange rates are positively autocorrelated. In {{the case that the}} futures exchange rates are uncorrelated or negatively autocorrelated, the MNF prefers not to commit to any finite liquidation thresholds. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. postprin...|$|R

5|$|Scott Street bridge had {{gradually}} deteriorated, and {{a public}} consultation was held in 1986, to determine <b>its</b> <b>future.</b> By that time a 10-ton weight limit had been imposed on traffic using the bridge, because of its poor structural state. Three suggestions were made as to <b>its</b> <b>future.</b> These were to close and demolish it, to refurbish it at an estimated cost of £1.6million, and {{to build a new}} bridge on the same site but a different alignment, to eliminate the awkward turn at the west end, which was costed at £2million. None of these actions have been taken, as the bridge leaves were raised in 1994, and have remained raised ever since. Consideration was given in 2007 to preserving two of the hydraulic rams which operated the bridge, during planning to demolish the structure. The Hull Hydraulic Power Company was set up in 1872, and by 1876 was operating a pumping station on Machell Street. This supplied water to a high pressure main which ran from Wellington Street to Sculcoates Bridge, and was used by local industries to power machinery, including the bridge when it was constructed. Although the power company closed in the 1940s, it made Hull the first city in the world to have a public system of power distribution.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{that the}} price relationship between a stock index and <b>its</b> associated nearby <b>futures</b> markets {{can be explained by}} the cost-of-carry model using the concordance correlation (CC) coefficient in the US financial markets. The main purpose of this research is to confirm that the CC coefficient is an appropriate methodology to determine ex post arbitrage opportunities and to maximize ex ante arbitrage profits through the analysis of the price relationship derived from the cost-of-carry model. To increase the robustness of the results and to enable us to generalize our conclusions, this analysis is carried out in consideration of external uncertainty, including the marking-to-market procedure of futures contracts and the transaction cost on the stock index and <b>its</b> <b>futures</b> markets, under several assumptions related to the conditions of transactions. Examining transaction price data on the S&P 500 stock index and <b>its</b> <b>futures</b> markets shows that the CC coefficient gives a good result for ex ante arbitrage profits and is appropriate for analyzing the relationship between the observed stock index futures market price and its theoretical price derived from the cost-of-carry model.
