5|$|In {{the first}} part of the 12th century, the manor passed from the second Baron of Dunham Massey to Matthew de Bromale. According to Dean, Matthew's father is said to have founded the de Bromale family, naming himself after the manor, and <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have been related to or a {{follower}} of the de Masseys. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> have also held the manor at some point. The de Bromales held the manor until 1370 when Alice de Bromale married John de Davenport, and the family name was changed.|$|E

5|$|The chapter-general re-elected Vermigli to the Spoletan abbacy in 1534 {{and again}} in 1535, {{but he was not}} elected to lead any house the {{following}} year. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> have been identified as a promising reformer who could help with reform efforts in higher places. Vermigli was in contact with the Catholic leaders working on the Consilium de emendanda ecclesia, an internal report on potential reforms of the Church commissioned by Pope PaulIII. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> have even travelled to Rome to assist in writing it.|$|E

5|$|Although Charles II's anti-French Parliament {{had forced}} England to {{withdraw}} from the Franco-Dutch War in 1674, some English regiments remained in French service. In April Churchill was appointed the colonelcy of one such regiment, thereafter serving with, and learning from, the great Marshal Turenne. Churchill was present at the hard-fought battles of Sinsheim in June 1674, and Enzheim in October; <b>he</b> <b>may</b> also have been present at Sasbach in July 1675, where Turenne was killed.|$|E

5|$|Although the Georgian Chronicles {{maintain}} that David died in 1001, several Armenian and Muslim accounts suggest <b>he</b> <b>may</b> {{have died in}} 1000. Aristakes gives the date of David’s death as March 28, 1000, which is closely corroborated by another Armenian chronicler Asoghik who says David died on the Easter {{day of the year}} 449 of the Armenian calendar, i.e., March 31, 1000. Yet another Armenian, Samuel Anetsi, also puts the date as 1000.|$|E
5|$|Aware {{that the}} public {{appreciated}} instrumental music with context, Liszt provided written prefaces for nine of his symphonic poems. However, Liszt's view of the symphonic poem tended to be evocative, using music to create a general mood or atmosphere rather than to illustrate a narrative or describe something literally. In this regard, Liszt authority Humphrey Searle suggests that <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have been closer to his contemporary Hector Berlioz than to many who would follow him in writing symphonic poems.|$|E
5|$|Beato pioneered {{and refined}} the {{techniques}} of hand-colouring photographs and making panoramas. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> have started hand-colouring photographs {{at the suggestion of}} Wirgman, or <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have seen the hand-coloured photographs made by partners Charles Parker and William Parke Andrew. Whatever the inspiration, Beato's coloured landscapes are delicate and naturalistic and his coloured portraits, more strongly coloured than the landscapes, are appraised as excellent. As well as providing views in colour, Beato worked to represent very large subjects in a way that gave a sense of their vastness. Throughout his career, Beato's work is marked by spectacular panoramas, which he produced by carefully making several contiguous exposures of a scene and then joining the resulting prints together, thereby re-creating the expansive view. The complete version of his panorama of Pehtang comprises seven photographs joined together almost seamlessly for a total length of more than 2 metres (6 1/2ft).|$|E

5|$|Behind {{the coup}} were almost {{certainly}} the Byzantines, who had every interest in removing a dangerous enemy and replacing him with somebody, if {{not from a}} pro-Byzantine faction, at least less actively aggressive. Gian Piero Bognetti advances a few hypotheses about Helmichis' motivation for his coup: his reason could have involved a family link to the Lethings, the Lombard royal dynasty that had been dispossessed by Alboin's father Audoin; or <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have been related through Amalafrid to the Amali, the leading dynasty of the Goths. Helmichis easily obtained {{the support of the}} Lombards in Verona, and he probably hoped to sway all the warriors and Lombard dukes to his side by having Alboin's only child, Albsuinda, under his control. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> also have hoped for Byzantine help in buying the dukes' loyalty economically.|$|E
5|$|Burnell was a {{dominant}} figure {{during the first}} part of Edward's reign, and he controlled most aspects of royal administration. He was involved not only in domestic issues but also in foreign relations, a responsibility he retained for two decades after Edward's return to England in 1274. Huscroft argues that <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have been the most important royal administrator of the 13th century.|$|E
