25|$|The {{destruction}} of the vegetation implies the {{destruction of}} evoluted soils, or a regressive evolution.

5|$|Exposure {{to reduced}} {{atmospheric}} pressure {{during the period}} after a dive when the residual gas levels have not yet stabilized at atmospheric saturation levels can incur a risk of decompression sickness. Rules for safe ascent are based on extension of the decompression model calculations to the desired altitude, but are generally simplified to a few fixed periods {{for a range of}} exposures. For the extreme case of an exceptional exposure dive, the US Navy requires a surface <b>interval</b> <b>of</b> 48 hours before ascent to altitude. A surface <b>interval</b> <b>of</b> 24 hours for a Heliox decompression dive and 12 hours for Heliox no-decompression dive are also specified. More detailed surface interval requirements based on the highest repetitive group designator obtained in the preceding 24‑hour period are given on the US Navy Diving Manual Table 9.6, both for ascents to specified altitudes, and for commercial flights in aircraft nominally pressurized to 8000ft.|$|E
5|$|For example, the {{subset of}} the integers{0,1,2} is {{contained}} in the <b>interval</b> <b>of</b> real numbers, which is convex. The Shapley–Folkman lemma implies that every point in {{is the sum of}} an integer from{0,1} and a real number from.|$|E
5|$|If an <b>interval</b> <b>of</b> {{the real}} numbers is {{partitioned}} into two non-empty parts L, R, such that every element of L is (strictly) less than every element of R, then either L contains a largest element or R contains a smallest element, but not both.|$|E
30|$|Similar to the Monte Carlo method, {{bootstrap}} simulations {{are performed}} 2000 times.

50|$|In 1993, {{the line}} was {{improved}} again. All trips were extended to the Moravia loop, and midday service was improved from <b>intervals</b> <b>of</b> 50 to 35 minutes. Evening hours were extended to midnight, and Saturday service was doubled to <b>intervals</b> <b>of</b> 45 minutes.|$|R

5|$|Radiocarbon dating of {{the human}} remains {{suggested}} that some {{were brought to the}} site between either 3980–3800 calibrated BCE (95% probability) or 3960–3880 cal BCE (68% probability). It further suggested that after an <b>interval</b> <b>of</b> either 60–350 years (95% probability) or 140–290 years (68% probability), additional depositions of human remains were made inside the tomb. This second phase probably began in 3730–3540 cal BCE (95% probability) or 3670–3560 cal BCE (68% probability).|$|E
5|$|The initial dive uses table A, and the diver is {{allocated}} a Surfacing Code {{based on}} depth {{and time of}} the dive. After a surface <b>interval</b> <b>of</b> at least 15 minutes the diver can select a new Current Tissue Code which models the residual nitrogen load, and uses this code to select the repetitive dive table.|$|E
30|$|Statistical {{significant}} {{relationship of the}} two pastoral cattle populations was also determined by comparing the confidence <b>intervals</b> <b>of</b> their cattle-level sero-positivity.

New formulas and additional restrictions for <b>intervals</b> <b>of</b> moments, including mean value, are obtained. Among them are Novoselov formulas for moments and the so-called “Ring of formulas” for mean values. In the scope <b>of</b> the <b>interval</b> analysis <b>of</b> distributions, the ruptures for mean values are considered. The <b>interval</b> analysis <b>of</b> distributions may be used, e. g., in probability theory, modeling, forecasting, economics, utility theory. ...|$|R

5|$|Banksia ericifolia {{depends on}} fire for regeneration; if fires are too infrequent, populations age and {{eventually}} die out. However, too-frequent fires also threaten this species, which takes around {{six years to}} reach maturity and flower. One study estimated an optimum fire <b>interval</b> <b>of</b> 15–30years. For {{a large part of}} its distribution Banksia ericifolia grows near areas of human habitation on Australia's eastern coastline. Bushland near urban areas is subject to both arson and prescribed burns, drastically reducing fire intervals and resulting in the disappearance of the species from some areas. The hotter a fire the more quickly seed is released; timing of rains afterwards is also critical for seedling survival.|$|E
5|$|Because of its higher {{susceptibility}} {{and lower}} reliance on fire for reproduction, the optimal fire interval for B.prionotes {{is higher than}} for other Banksia species with which it occurs. One simulation suggested an <b>interval</b> <b>of</b> 18 years was optimal for B.prionotes, compared to 15 years for B.hookeriana and 11 years for B.attenuata. The same model suggested that B.prionotes is quite susceptible to reductions in fire intervals. On the other hand, it shows little susceptibility to increases in fire interval: although senescence and death are often observed in plants older than about 30 years, healthy stands have been observed that have escaped fire for 50 years. These stands have a multi-aged structure, demonstrating the occurrence of successful inter-fire recruitment.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is a {{powerful}} source of radio waves in the spectral region stretching from several kilohertz to tens of megahertz. Radio waves with frequencies of less than about 0.3MHz (and thus wavelengths longer than 1km) are called the Jovian kilometric radiation or KOM. Those with frequencies in the <b>interval</b> <b>of</b> 0.3–3MHz (with wavelengths of 100–1000m) are called the hectometric radiation or HOM, while emissions in the range 3–40MHz (with wavelengths of 10–100m) {{are referred to as}} the decametric radiation or DAM. The latter radiation was the first to be observed from Earth, and its approximately 10-hour periodicity helped to identify it as originating from Jupiter. The strongest part of decametric emission, which is related to Io and to the Io–Jupiter current system, is called Io-DAM.|$|E

5|$|Maintaining {{the same}} <b>interval</b> <b>of</b> three years between Germanicus' and Drusus' {{first and second}} term as consul, Drusus was given the consulship again in AD 21, which he held with his father.

For Tiberius, Drusus holding the consulship was a welcome sight, and with the state of his health, he retreated to Campania, leaving Drusus alone in carrying out the obligations of the consulship. Tiberius' retreat lasted about twenty months.|$|E

5|$|On June 7, 2010, {{long after}} the microlensing event had subsided, the science teams {{studying}} the star used the NACO adaptive optics facility at the Very Large Telescope in Chile to determine the actual apparent magnitude of the star that microlensed its background star, hoping {{to compare it to}} the magnitude of the star measured during the microlensing event. A discrepancy was found, a discrepancy that may have been a result of either error or of a planetary body. Interpretation of follow-up observations led to the planet's confirmation. The ratio between the planet's mass and its host star's mass is well-constrained, but a large <b>interval</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty exists because the host star's mass is known within a large confidence interval that spans the mass of all red dwarf stars.|$|E
