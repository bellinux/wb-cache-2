40|$|In Mobile Ad-hoc networks, {{without any}} fixed access point the mobile nodes are formed randomly. The {{congestion}} may increase while the network traffic increases {{due to the}} dynamic topology of nodes and limited capacity of memory. In Ad-hoc networks, the congestion {{is an important issue}} because it will lead to loss of packet, long delay and overhead of packets and so the performance of Ad-hoc networks also reduces. The congestion control is based on controlling the traffic in which too many packets exist in the part of the subnet. This manuscript proposes the Enhanced Clusterhead <b>Gateway</b> <b>Switch</b> Routing Protocol (ECGSR) with the basis of Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) based mechanism for congestion control. In this process, the cluster head plays the main role in monitoring the congestion in Ad-hoc networks, by reducing the number of transmissions and by creating the routes on need. This proposed scheme is to reduce the loss of packets, routing overhead and end-to-end delay during the data packet transmission. So it accomplishes the throughput, better packet delivery ratio, low end-to-end delay and overhead by reducing the congestion in Ad-hoc networks using the chosen ECGSR protocol based on AODV basis.

Introduction: Ad hoc networks (MANETs) were initially conceived as stand-alone entities without connection to any external infra-structure.

Different mechanisms have been proposed to integrate MANETs and the Internet. These strategies differ in gateway discovery mechanism, cell switching criteria, ad hoc routing protocol. In this paper, Mobile-IP is integrated with Hierarchical Cluster-Head <b>Gateway</b> <b>Switch</b> Routing (CGSR) Protocol to provide Internet access to the mobile node of the ad hoc Network. This paper discusses a mechanism for selecting an alternate route in case if the Cluster Head is unable to forward the packets to the destination. The proposed framework provides bi-directional connectivity between the MANET and the Internet nodes. A detailed performance comparison is made between the proposed approach and the other three-tier strategies based on mobility of cluster heads and cluster gateways and other network parameters.

40|$|A {{study by}} Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) {{revealed}} that about 60 % {{of the office}} PCs are left powered-up 24 / 7 only to maintain the network connectivity for remote access, Voice-over-IP (VOIP) clients, Instant Messaging (IM) and other administrative management reasons. The Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) proposed several low power states for PCs as effective mechanism to reduce energy waste, but unfortunately they are seldomly used due to their incapability to maintain network presence. Thus, Billions of dollars of electricity is wasted every year to keep idle or unused network devices fully powered-up only to maintain the network connectivity. This dissertation addresses the Network Connectivity Proxy (NCP), a concept recently been proposed as an optimal strategy to reduce energy waste due to idle network devices. The NCP is a software entity running on a low power network device (such as home <b>gateway,</b> <b>switch</b> or router) and impersonates presence for high power devices (such as PCs) during their sleeping periods. It wakes-up a sleeping device only when its resources are required. In short, the NCP impersonates link layer, network layer, transport layer and application layer presence on behalf of sleeping devices. In this dissertation, we presented the design and implementation of our NCP prototype. The NCP concept faces several issues and challenges that we tried to address in {{the most effective way}} in our implementations. Knowing when to start or stop proxying presence on behalf of sleeping devices is critically important for the NCP operations. To achieve this objective in a seamless way without requiring any user intervention, we developed a kernel module that monitors the power state transitions of the device and immediately informs the NCP over a suitable communication protocol in case of any update. An important challenge for the NCP is its ability to proxy a huge and ever increasing number of applications and networking protocols on behalf of sleeping devices. To tackle with this challenge in an efficient way, we implemented a quite generalized set of behavioral rules in our NCP framework that can be suitable for any protocol or application. We also incorporated deployment flexibility in our NCP software that enables us to operate it on on-board NIC, switch/router or on a standalone PC. On-board NIC and switch/router are the optimal locations for the NCP software in home/small office environment (very limited number of devices) or a standalone PC with enough resources is a good choice if high scalability is desirable e. g., medium or large size organizations. A communication protocol is required for information exchange between the NCP and client devices e. g., for power state notifications, registration/de-registration of client devices/behavioral rules etc. To avoid any configuration issues, we developed a flexible and reliable communication framework based on the Universal Plug & Play (UPnP) architecture that provides interesting features such as auto-discovery, zero-configuration and seamless communication between the NCP and client devices. We expanded the NCP coverage beyond LAN boundaries in order to exploit its full potential in terms of energy savings by covering for thousands of client devices. A single global powerful NCP instance located anywhere in the Internet can make easier the implementation of complex tasks and boosts up the energy savings by also shutting down the unused access links and the packets forwarding equipments whenever possible. Further, we also extended the NCP concept for mobile devices to help in improving the battery life. Another important contribution of this dissertation includes the extensive evaluation of the NCP performance on different low power hardwares. We performed large number of experiments and evaluated the effectiveness of NCP prototype in differen...|$|E

30|$|The {{design of}} routing {{protocol}} {{is an important}} part of the proposed architecture because it deals with minimizing the routing overhead, ensuring end-to-end data delivery, and defining the rules of interaction among co-existing networks. The network layer enhancements are not concerned with routing engine but relate to the maintenance and aggregation of charging and billing information at each network provider’s end. A sensor network first attempts to discover a route through its native channel. In case of success in route discovery through native network, assistance from co-existing sensor networks is not required. But when that fails, the sensor node or <b>gateway</b> <b>switches</b> to common channel for route discovery. The design of routing protocol accommodates billing and charging information in routing and data packets while keeping data and communication overhead as low as possible. Although we select ad-hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol for the proposed enhancements due to its application in sensor and ah-hoc networks but these modifications are simple and generic and can also be implemented in other routing protocols.|$|R

40|$|The Badenian-Sarmatian {{boundary}} interval {{is marked}} by a major extinction event of marine species in the Central Paratethys. The exact age of the boundary is debated because many successions in marginal basins show erosional features and fauna reworking at the boundary level. Here, we selected the Tisa section in the Carpathian foredeep basin of Romania, which is continuous across this Badenian-Sarmatian Extinction Event (BSEE). Quantitative biostratigraphic records of planktic and benthic foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils allow to accurately locate the Badenian-Sarmatian boundary and indicate a major paleoenvironmental change from open marine to brackish water conditions. Magnetostratigraphic results reveal a polarity pattern that uniquely correlates to the time interval between 12. 8 and 12. 2. Ma. Interpolation of constant sedimentation rates determines the age of the BSEE in the Carpathian foredeep at 12. 65. ±. 0. 01. Ma, in good agreement with several earlier estimates. We conclude that the extinction event took place in less than 10. kyr, and that it was most likely synchronous across the Central Paratethys.

40|$|Communicated by Editor’s name Mobile Backbone Wireless Networks (MBWN) [10] are {{wireless}} {{networks in}} which the base stations are mobile. Our strategy is the following: mobile nodes are dynamically grouped into clusters of bounded radius. In the very large wireless networks we deal with we deal with, several hundreds of clusters may be generated. Clustering makes use of a two dimensional Euclidean version of the Antipole Tree data structure [5]. This very effective structure was originally designed for finite sets of points in an arbitrary metric space to support efficient range searching. It requires only a linear number of pairwise distance calculations among nodes. Mobile Base Stations occupy an approximate centroid of the clusters and are moved according to a fast practical bipartite matching algorithm which tries to minimize both total and maximum distance. We show that the best known computational geometry algorithms [1] become infeasible for our application when {{a high number of}} mobile base stations is required. On the other hand our proposed 8 % average error solution requires O(k log k) running time instead of the approximatively O(k 2) exact algorithm [1]. Communication among nodes is realized by a Clusterhead <b>Gateway</b> <b>Switching</b> Routing (CGSR) protocol [15] where the mobile base stations are organized in a suitable network.
