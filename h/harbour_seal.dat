5|$|Other {{marine mammal}} prey species include nearly 20 species of seal, sea lion and fur seal. Walruses and sea otters are less {{frequently}} taken. Often, to avoid injury, killer whales disable their prey before killing and eating it. This may involve throwing {{it in the}} air, slapping it with their tails, ramming it, or breaching and landing on it. Sea lions are killed by head-butting or after a stunning blow from a tail fluke. In the Aleutian Islands, a decline in sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in <b>harbour</b> <b>seal</b> and Steller sea lion populations, the killer whale's preferred prey, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now decimated by industrial whaling.|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> (Phoca vitulina) in West Greenland {{declined}} rapidly after the 1950 s and the seals have now abandoned their traditional haulout locations along the Greenland west coast. However, in recent years, a previously undetected {{group of about}} 60 - 100 <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> has been observed approximately 80 km upstream in a large river, and some traditional haulout locations are still in use near the south-eastern tip of Greenland. A small number of <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> is caught annually far from any of these locations, indicating that other groups might live unnoticed. Catch statistics provide the best evidence of the presence and locations of these remnant <b>harbour</b> <b>seals.</b> Therefore {{efforts were made to}} validate the recent catch statistics and to describe the catch history for the past 60 years. The catch statistics were also used to estimate plausible ranges of past and present numbers of <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> {{based on the assumption that}} hunting has caused the observed decline. The total number of <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> in Greenland according to these estimates was about 3, 000 in 1950 and fewer than 1, 000 in 2007. The number of <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> caught in the southernmost part of Greenland has, unlike in the rest of Greenland, increased significantly in some of the recent years. This change seems to be related to changes in the amount of drift ice. Drift ice reduces the frequency of contact between hunters and <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> in South Greenland and above normal quantities of drift ice from the mid 1960 s to the mid 1980 s probably allowed these seals to increase in numbers. Record low inflow of drift ice in some of the recent years, however, has resulted in record high catches, which likely have reduced the seals again. The remaining <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> in Greenland are few and without protection these seals are potentially in danger of extinction. </div...|$|R

The seals stranded on the Dutch coastlines between 2009 and 2014.

The presence of morphologic abnormalities were {{the highest in the}} alimentary tract (203 abnormalities were scored in this category. In most cases the cause of death remained unknown after necropsy (50, 5 %). The hypothesis of the study was, that there were no differences in causes of death between the species, between the animals that were found dead or that were euthanized and that there were no differences between this studies results when comparing the to earlier studies. The cause of death that was established the most in the seals that were examined, was parasitic bronchopneumonia (13, 5 %), followed by septicaemia (12, 6 %). The grey seals significantly died more often due to emaciation (P= 0. 023) or inferred bycatch (P= 0. 040), in comparison with the <b>harbour</b> <b>seals.</b> Euthanized <b>harbour</b> <b>seals,</b> in comparison with <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> that were found dead or died soon after stranding (< 24 hours), significantly died more often due to parasitic bronchopneumonia (P= 0. 004) and significantly more often the cause of death could be determined in this group (P= 0. 012).

Ringed seals are hunted all year, while harp seals are only available during the summer. Because seals need {{to break through the}} ice to reach air, they form breathing holes with their teeth and claws. Through these, Inuit hunters are able to capture seals. When a hunter arrives at these holes, they set up a seal indicator that alerts the hunter when a seal is coming up for a breath of air. When the seal comes up, the hunter notices movement in the indicator and uses his harpoon to capture the seal in the water.|$|E

40|$|The annual moult in <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> (Phoca vitulina L.) {{follows a}} few weeks after the end of {{lactation}} and is characterised by a progressive loss and regrowth of hair which is apparent over a 4 – 6 week period. It is thought that during the moult <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> increase the time spent ashore as an adaptation to avoid additional energy costs associated with blood flow to the skin surface. The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> regulated their surface temperature in order to maximise hair regrowth during the moult. The surface temperatures of two female <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> were recorded in captivity from late pregnancy to completion of the moult using infrared thermography. In this study, animals hauled out (exited the water onto land) more frequently during lactation and throughout the moult. Compared to the premoult period the temperature difference between body surface and air temperature (dT) showed a ∼ 10 °C elevation at the peak of the moult. Also, during the moult dT reached a higher maximum at a faster rate over a two hour haul-out period. Heat loss was estimated to increase during the moult and was equivalent to an approximate doubling of resting metabolic rate. It was therefore evident that <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> minimise the energetic cost of the moult by hauling out so that they can maintain optimal high skin surface temperature for hair growth. Human disturbance at haul-out sites that causes animals to enter the water during the moult may have consequences for <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> for two reasons. Firstly, reduced time spent ashore in optimal conditions for hair regeneration may prolong the duration of the moult and secondly, repeatedly forcing animals into the water when their skin temperature is high will incur an energetic cost...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Harbour {{porpoises}} (Phocoena phocoena) and <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> (Phoca vitulina) are two representative top predator {{species of}} the North Sea ecosystem. The median values of sum of 21 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and sum of 10 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners were 23. 1 ìg/g lipid weight (lw) and 0. 33 ìg/g lw in blubber of <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> (n = 28) and 12. 4 ìg/g lw and 0. 76 ìg/g lw in blubber of harbour porpoises (n = 35), respectively. For both species, the highest PCB concentrations were observed in adult males indicating bioaccumulation. On the contrary, the highest PBDE concentrations were measured in juveniles, likely due to better-developed metabolic capacities with age in adults. A higher contribution of lower chlorinated and non-persistent congeners, such as CB 52, CB 95, CB 101, and CB 149, together with higher contributions of other PBDE congeners than BDE 47, indicated that harbour porpoises are unable to metabolize these compounds. <b>Harbour</b> <b>seals</b> showed a higher ability to metabolize PCBs and PBDEs.

5|$|Blakeney Point has a mixed {{colony of}} about 500 <b>harbour</b> and grey <b>seals.</b> The <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> have their young between June and August, and the pups, which can swim almost immediately, {{may be seen}} on the mud flats. Grey seals breed in winter, between November and January; their young cannot swim until they have lost their first white coat, so they are {{restricted}} to dry land for their first three or four weeks, and can be viewed on the beach during this period. Grey seals colonised a site in east Norfolk in 1993, and started breeding regularly at Blakeney in 2001. It is possible that they now outnumber <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> off the Norfolk coast.

For both species, the highest PCB concentrations were observed in adult males {{as the result of}} accumulation for years and years, while the highest PBDE concentrations were measured in juveniles probably due to better developed metabolic capacities for these congeners with age in adults. Results for PCBs were higher than observations in <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> and porpoises from other areas, while results for PBDEs were comparable indicating that the North Sea is a highly contaminated area.

40|$|International audienceSpecies {{distribution}} maps {{can provide}} important information to focus conservation efforts and enable spatial management of human activities. Two sympatric marine predators, grey seals Halichoerus grypus and <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> Phoca vitulina, have overlapping ranges {{on land and}} at sea but contrasting population dynamics around Britain: whilst grey seals have generally increased, <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> have shown significant regional declines. We analysed 2 decades of at-sea movement data and terrestrial count data from these species to produce high resolution, broad-scale maps of distribution and associated uncertainty to inform conservation and management. Our results showed that grey seals use offshore areas connected to their haul-out sites by prominent corridors, and <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> primarily stay within 50 km of the coastline. Both species show fine-scale offshore spatial segregation off {{the east coast of}} Britain and broad-scale partitioning off western Scotland. These results illustrate that, for broad-scale marine spatial planning, the conservation needs of <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> (primarily inshore, the exception being selected offshore usage areas) are different from those of grey seals (up to 100 km offshore and corridors connecting these areas to haul-out sites).

40|$|Managing a wild {{population}} effectively requires {{knowledge of}} the abundance and behaviour of the species. <b>Harbour</b> <b>seals</b> (Phoca vitulina) are usually counted when they come ashore at haul-out sites, {{and so it is}} important to understand how the number of seals counted at this time relates to total population size. Satellite telemetry studies confirmed that <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> on the west coast of Scotland showed a degree of site fidelity and coastal foraging. Most trips taken by tagged animals involved travelling only 10 - 30 km from haul-outs and lasted less than a day (mean 21. 07 hours, SE = 0. 54), although some seals travelled over 100 km.

40|$|<b>Harbour</b> <b>seals</b> and <b>harbour</b> {{porpoises}} are top predator {{species from}} the North Sea, have long life spans and hence, {{are known to}} accumulate high levels of anthropogenic contaminants. To gain knowledge about the behaviour of naturally-produced compounds in these marine mammals, the biomagnification of naturally-produced methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (MeO-PBDEs) was assessed. The biomagnification of MeO-PBDEs (2 ¿-MeO-BDE 68 and 6 -MeO-BDE 47) was lower in <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> (all biomagnification factors (BMFs) 1). This may indicate a better metabolic breakdown of MeO-PBDEs in <b>harbour</b> <b>seals,</b> as was previously suggested for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). In both predators, 6 -MeO-BDE 47 had the highest concentrations (range: 45 ¿ 483 ng/g lw and 2 ¿ 38 ng/g lw for <b>harbour</b> porpoises and <b>seals,</b> respectively) compared to 2 ¿-MeO-BDE 68 (range: 2 ¿ 28 ng/g lw and 1 ¿ 6 ng/g lw for <b>harbour</b> porpoises and <b>seals,</b> respectively).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a detailed {{model of the}} thermal balance of a seal in air. We tested the model against the limited experimental information available on thermoregulation for <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> (Phoca vitulina) in air. Since a mother must meet both her own and her pups' energetic costs, we suggest {{that there may be}} an energetic advantage for <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> in Scotland if lactation is timed to coincide with the most favourable conditions for hauling out. To test this hypothesis, we used the <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> in the Moray Firth as our case study. The model does predict an energetic cost resulting from thermoregulation during haul-out for a mother and her pup in the Moray Firth. Taking the mother and pup as a unit, we estimate the minimum cost during lactation. This combined cost, which must be met by the female seal, is similar to the minimum metabolic rate during haul-out for the summer predicted from the model. In winter the predicted minimum metabolic rate exceeds the lactation cost, and an additional cost of thermoregulation results. The model predicts the most energetically favourable time for lactation to be June and July, and this is coincident with the timing of pupping in this seal population. We suggest that for <b>harbour</b> <b>seals</b> in Scotland, the timing of pupping may be influenced by the thermoregulation costs of haul-out. This provides indirect evidence that thermoregulation influences haul-out behaviour in this small phocid species...|$|R
