5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate <b>expectation</b> in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a legitimate <b>expectation</b> generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate <b>expectation</b> as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate <b>expectation</b> to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate <b>expectation</b> to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedural}} {{dimension of}} the doctrine of legitimate <b>expectation</b> has been recognized by Singapore courts and, since 2013, the substantive form of the doctrine as well. However, whether the courts will adopt the UK approach with regard to measuring legitimate <b>expectation</b> with the ruler of proportionality remains an open question.|$|E
5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism {{as to whether}} the doctrine of legitimate <b>expectation</b> should apply to substantive rights. Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights. Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with {{the manner in which the}} decision was made and not whether the decision was fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive legitimate <b>expectation</b> impinges on the separation of powers. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest. Applying legitimate <b>expectation</b> substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E

5000|$|Operational {{definition}} of the <b>expectations</b> construct: The way that <b>expectations</b> has been operationalised also represents a concern for theorists investigating {{the validity of the}} gaps model. The literature identifies different types of <b>expectations.</b> Of these, there is an argument that only forecast <b>expectations</b> are true <b>expectations.</b> Yet, the SERVQUAL instrument appears to elicit ideal <b>expectations.</b> [...] Note the wording in the questionnaire in the preceding figure which grounds respondents in their <b>expectations</b> of what excellent companies will do. Subtle use of words can elicit different types of <b>expectations.</b> Capturing true <b>expectations</b> is important because it has implications for service quality scores. When researchers elicit ideal <b>expectations,</b> overall service quality scores are likely to be lower, making it much more difficult for marketers to deliver on those <b>expectations.</b>|$|R

5|$|In Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the {{applicant}} {{and her husband}} owned a semi-detached house which they wished to redevelop. In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had issued a circular imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of semi-detached houses. The URA rejected {{the applicant}}'s redevelopment application {{on the basis of}} the circular. Counsel for the applicant argued before the High Court that the applicant had a legitimate <b>expectation</b> that the proposal to redevelop the house would be approved. The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led the applicant to have such a legitimate <b>expectation.</b> It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) to determine whether a legitimate <b>expectation</b> has been created: the public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply. The only legitimate <b>expectation</b> that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception has to be made. The applicant in Borissik argued that she had a legitimate <b>expectation</b> to a substantive right, but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her, it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive legitimate expectations in Singapore.|$|E

30|$|Future <b>expectations</b> often remain unobserved and {{traditional}} macro- or micro-economic models typically make assumptions {{on how they}} are formed, e.g. assuming rational <b>expectations.</b> The conclusions from these models may be biased if the assumptions on <b>expectations</b> are not satisfied. To solve the problem that <b>expectations</b> are unobserved, many recent empirical studies aim at measuring <b>expectations</b> directly using survey questions. See, for example, Manski (2004) for {{an assessment of the}} validity of this approach and a recent special issue of Journal of Applied Econometrics (Bellemare and Manski, 2011).

5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate <b>expectation</b> originates from common law principles of fairness. English courts developed this doctrine largely to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by decision-makers. Generally, the courts will grant {{judicial review of}} an administrative decision based on an individual's legitimate <b>expectation</b> if a public authority has made a representation to the individual within its powers. The individual has {{to show that the}} representation was a clear and unambiguous promise, an established practice or a public announcement. This is largely a factual inquiry.|$|E

In this paper, the authors relax the assumption of rational <b>expectations</b> with perfect knowledge and reexamine the role of inflation <b>expectations</b> in the economy and in the conduct of monetary policy. Agents are assumed to have imperfect knowledge of the precise structure of the economy and the policymakers' preferences. <b>Expectations</b> are governed by a perpetual learning technology. With learning, disturbances can give rise to endogenous inflation scares, that is, significant and persistent deviations of inflation <b>expectations</b> from those implied by rational <b>expectations.</b> The presence of learning increases the sensitivity of inflation <b>expectations</b> and the term structure of interest rates to economic shocks, in line with the empirical evidence.
