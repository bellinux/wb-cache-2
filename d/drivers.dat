5|$|<b>Drivers</b> can {{get away}} with this rule-breaking due to their paper-based log books. As a driver records their time spent behind the wheel, there is very little to stop them from forging their log books. There is very {{superficial}} oversight and some <b>drivers</b> take advantage of this fact. Surveys indicate that between 25% and 75% of <b>drivers</b> violate the HOS. Other <b>drivers</b> maintain more than one log book, showing falsified versions to enforcement officers.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofers use speaker <b>drivers</b> (woofers) {{typically}} between 8-inch (20cm) and 21-inch (53cm) in diameter. Some uncommon subwoofers use larger <b>drivers,</b> {{and single}} prototype subwoofers {{as large as}} 60-inch (152cm) have been fabricated. On the smaller end of the spectrum, subwoofer <b>drivers</b> as small as 4-inch (10cm) may be used. Small subwoofer <b>drivers</b> in the 4-inch range are typically used in small computer speaker systems and compact home theatre subwoofer cabinets. The size of the driver and number of <b>drivers</b> in a cabinet depends {{on the design of}} the loudspeaker enclosure, the size of the cabinet, the desired sound pressure level, the lowest frequency targeted and the level of permitted distortion. The most common subwoofer driver sizes used for sound reinforcement in nightclubs, raves and pop/rock concerts are 10-, 12-, 15- and 18-inch models (25cm, 30cm, 38cm, and 45cm respectively). The largest available sound reinforcement subwoofers, 21-inch (53cm) <b>drivers,</b> are less commonly seen.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{low-power}} compact <b>driver</b> for multi-standard {{physical layer}} is presented. The proposed <b>driver</b> achieves low power and small area through the voltage-mode <b>driver</b> with trans-impedance configuration and the novel hybrid <b>driver,.</b> In the voltage-mode <b>driver,</b> a trans-impedance configuration alleviates {{the problem of}} limited common-mode range of error amplifiers and the area and power overhead due to pre-amplifier. For a standard with extended output swing, only current sources are added in parallel with the voltage-mode <b>driver,</b> which is named a ‘hybrid driver’. The hybrid architecture not only increases output swing but reduces overall <b>driver</b> area. The overall <b>driver</b> occupies 0. 14 mm 2. Power consumptions under 3. 3 -V supply are 24. 5 mW for the voltage-mode <b>driver</b> and 44. 5 mW for the hybrid <b>driver.</b> Index Terms—Multi-standard <b>driver,</b> voltage-mode <b>driver,</b> trans-impedance configuration, hybrid drive...|$|R

5|$|Between 1962 and 2003, {{there were}} {{numerous}} proposals to change the HOS again, but none were ever finalized. By this time, the ICC had been abolished, and regulations were now issued by the FMCSA. The 2003 changes applied only to property-carrying <b>drivers</b> (i.e., truck <b>drivers).</b> These rules allowed 11hours of driving within a 14-hour period, and required 10hours of rest. These changes would allow <b>drivers</b> (using the entire 14-hour on-duty period) to maintain a natural 24-hour cycle, with a bare minimum 21-hour cycle (11hours driving, 10hours rest). However, the retention of the split sleeper berth provision would allow <b>drivers</b> to maintain irregular, short-burst sleeping schedules.|$|E

A network which can be controllable using one <b>driver</b> node is considered. Nonuniqueness of <b>driver</b> node poses a challenge to select right <b>driver</b> node when multiple possibilities exist. The work addresses this issue.
