Optical density was determined using concentration dependent dilutions with 0.9  % (w/v) NaCl. For gravimetric determination of dry cell mass 10  ml of the culture broth from each sampling point was transferred into dry-weighed 15  ml sampling tubes and centrifuged for 20  min at 4643 ×g and 4  °C. The supernatant of each sample was transferred into a new tube and stored at − 20  °C prior to the determination of ammonia ions, glycerol content and surface tension. The remaining cell pellet was washed with 5  ml 0.9  % (w/v) NaCl followed by centrifugation (10  min at 4643 ×g and 4  °C), decanting and drying to constant weight in a <b>drying</b> <b>closet</b> at 100  °C.|$|E

5000|$|By 1869 Manchester had a {{population}} of about 354,000 people served by about 38,000 middensteads and 10,000 water closets. An investigation of the condition of the city's sewer network revealed that it was [...] "choked up with an accumulation of solid filth, caused by overflow from the middens". [...] Such problems forced the city authorities to consider other methods of human waste disposal. The water closet was used in wealthy homes, but concerns over river pollution, costs and available water supplies meant that most towns and cities chose more labour-intensive dry conservancy systems. Manchester was one such city and by 1877 its authorities had replaced about 40,000 middens with pail and midden closets, rising to 60,000 by 1881. [...] The soil surrounding the old middens was cleared out, connections with drains and sewers removed and <b>dry</b> <b>closets</b> erected over each site. A contemporary estimate stated that the installation of about 25,000 pail closets removed as much as 3000000 imp gal of urine and accompanying faeces from the city's drains, sewers and rivers.|$|R

2500|$|Before {{the flush}} toilet became {{accepted}} in the late 19th century in developed countries, some inventors, scientists and public health officials supported the use of [...] "dry earth closets", a type of dry toilet with similarities to composting toilets, but the collection vessel for the human excreta was not designed to compost. <b>Dry</b> earth <b>closets</b> were invented by English clergyman Henry Moule, who dedicated his life to improving public sanitation after witnessing the cholera epidemics of 1849 and 1854. Impressed by the insalubrity of the houses, especially during the Great Stink {{in the summer of}} 1858, he invented what he called the 'dry earth system'.|$|R
