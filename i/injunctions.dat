5|$|Rowling and her {{publishers}} {{have brought}} a series of legal <b>injunctions</b> to ensure the books' secrecy before their launch. These <b>injunctions</b> have drawn criticism from civil liberties campaigners over their potentially sweeping powers over individual freedoms.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Chancery could grant three {{possible}} remedies– specific performance, <b>injunctions</b> and damages. The remedy of specific performance is, in contractual matters, an order {{by the court}} which requires the party in breach of contract to perform his obligations. The validity of the contract {{as a whole was}} not normally considered, only whether there was adequate consideration and if expecting the party that breached the contract to carry out his obligations was viable. <b>Injunctions,</b> on the other hand, are remedies which prevent a party from doing something (unlike specific performance, which requires them to do something). Until the Common Law Procedure Act 1854, the Court of Chancery was the only body qualified to grant <b>injunctions</b> and specific performance.|$|E
5|$|Another case {{of civil}} disobedience {{happened}} in the 2011 British privacy injunction debate, where several celebrities who had taken out anonymized <b>injunctions</b> were identified by thousands of users in protest to traditional journalism being censored.|$|E
50|$|A {{plaintiff}} in a patent infringement case {{can ask for}} an <b>injunction</b> prohibiting the defendant from committing the infringing acts in the future. An <b>injunction</b> is a discretionary remedy, and the court may decide, depending on {{the circumstances of the}} case, to delay giving an <b>injunction</b> for the defendant to close down his infringing operations or to refuse giving an <b>injunction</b> at all. In some cases, an <b>injunction</b> would prevent worthy innovators from entering the market.|$|R

5|$|The ACLU {{and other}} {{organizations}} also filed separate lawsuits around the country against telecommunications companies. The ACLU filed a lawsuit in Illinois (Terkel v. AT) which was dismissed because of the state secrets privilege and two others in California requesting <b>injunctions</b> against AT and Verizon. On August 10, 2006, the lawsuits against the telecommunications companies were transferred to {{a federal judge in}} San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the Australian {{government}} authority {{responsible for}} regulating the TPA, commenced an {{action in the}} Federal Court of Australia seeking declarations that Baxter's bundling pricing structure in its tenders had contravened Sections46 and 47 of the TPA. The ACCC sought the imposition of <b>injunctions</b> and pecuniary penalties by the court.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} part of a large reform {{movement}} to prevent equitable courts such as the Court of Chancery from undermining their business. It was far cheaper and faster than the older equivalents used by the Chancery and Common Pleas, leading to a drop in their business and an increase in that of the King's Bench. As such, the Chancery issued <b>injunctions</b> in an ineffective attempt to prevent its use. The Bill was finally abolished by the Uniformity of Process Act 1832.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2010 Clarkson {{was granted}} a privacy <b>injunction</b> against his first wife to prevent her from {{publishing}} claims that their sexual relationship continued after his second marriage (see AMM v HXW). He voluntarily lifted the <b>injunction</b> in October 2011, commenting that: [...] "Injunctions don’t work. You take out an <b>injunction</b> against somebody or some organisation and immediately news of that <b>injunction</b> and the people involved and {{the story behind the}} <b>injunction</b> is in a legal-free world on Twitter and the Internet. It’s pointless." ...|$|R
50|$|The court {{considered}} the applicable law regarding preliminary <b>injunction</b> relief, {{and found an}} <b>injunction</b> appropriate.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>injunction</b> must {{be granted}} by an {{overseeing}} entity {{if necessary to}} avoid grave harm to the petitioner {{as a result of}} the decision; however, if the <b>injunction</b> would cause major effects on the public welfare, the <b>injunction</b> may be withheld.|$|R
5|$|The case {{first went}} to the High Court of Justice, where it was heard by Fulford J; {{he decided that he}} did not have the {{authority}} to overrule Bonnard, and passed the case on to the Court of Appeal after granting a temporary injunction. In the Court of Appeal, the case was heard by May, Dyson and Brooke LJJ, with Brooke delivering the judgment on 5 November 2004. In it, Brooke judged that defamation, the subject of Greene, was significantly different from breach of confidentiality, the subject in Cream. While the damage from a breach of confidentiality can never be undone, justifiying a simple test for issuing <b>injunctions,</b> a defamation case that is won vindicates the injured party. Making it easier to grant <b>injunctions</b> in defamation cases would damage the delicate balance between freedom of the press and the right to privacy; as such, despite the Human Rights Act, Bonnard is still a valid test.|$|E
5|$|According to Jainism, {{the purpose}} of nonviolence is {{not because it is}} a commandment of a God or any other supreme being. Its purpose is also not simply because its {{observance}} is conducive to general welfare of the state or the community. While it is true that in Jainism, the moral and religious <b>injunctions</b> were laid down as law by Arhats who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but the life of the Arhats has demonstrated that such commandments were conductive to Arhat's own welfare, helping him to reach spiritual victory. Just as Arhats achieved spiritual victory by observing non-violence, so can anyone who follows this path.|$|E
5|$|After being urged into {{politics}} by his uncle, Judge Roscoe Tartar, Cooper ran unopposed {{for a seat}} in the Kentucky House of Representatives as a Republican in 1927. As a member of the House, he was one of only three Republicans to oppose Republican Governor Flem D. Sampson's unsuccessful attempt to politicize the state department of health; the measure failed by a single vote. Cooper supported the governor's plan to provide free textbooks for the state's school children and sponsored legislation to prohibit judges from issuing <b>injunctions</b> to end labor strikes, although the latter bill did not pass.|$|E

50|$|The {{district}} court granted to Microsoft an anti-suit <b>injunction</b> that prevented Motorola from enforcing a foreign patent infringement <b>injunction</b> that Motorola had obtained against Microsoft in Germany. After granting to Microsoft this preliminary <b>injunction,</b> {{the case was}} brought to the Appellate court in an interlocutory appeal by Motorola. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed the {{district court}}'s foreign anti-suit <b>injunction</b> for abuse of discretion, and affirmed the District Court's decision.|$|R

5|$|An {{injunction}} is {{an equitable}} private law remedy that restrains a public body from doing {{an act that}} is wrongful or ultra vires. Following law reforms in the United Kingdom in 1977, it became possible for the High Court of England and Wales to grant prerogative orders {{as well as a}} declaration or injunction in the same set of legal proceedings. As these reforms have not been followed in Singapore, the Singapore High Court is not empowered to grant <b>injunctions</b> under Order 53 of the Rules of Court.|$|E
5|$|In addition, if civil {{proceedings}} are taken against the Government, section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from granting <b>injunctions</b> against it. In place of an injunction, the Court {{may make a}} declaration concerning the parties' rights. The Court also may not make an injunction against a government officer if the effect of doing so would be to provide relief {{that could not be}} obtained against the Government directly. Section 2(2) of the Act makes it clear that the term {{civil proceedings}} includes proceedings for judicial review.|$|E
5|$|Jharokha Darshan was a daily {{practice}} {{of addressing the}} public audience (darshan) at the balcony (jharokha) at the forts and palaces of medieval kings in India. It was an essential and direct way of communicating face-to-face with the public, and was a practice which {{was adopted by the}} Mughal emperors. The balcony appearance in the name of Jharokha Darshan also spelled jharokha-i darshan was adopted by the 16th-century Mughal Emperor Akbar, even though it was contrary to Islamic <b>injunctions.</b> Earlier, Akbar's father Emperor Humayun had also adopted this Hindu {{practice of}} appearing before his subjects at the jharokha to hear their public grievances.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2013, Kozinski {{wrote an}} opinion {{reversing}} a district court ruling denying Japanese whalers Institute of Cetacean Research a preliminary <b>injunction</b> against the US-based anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Kozinski {{found that the}} militant conservationist group were [...] "pirates", reversed the denial of <b>injunction</b> by the district court, and affirmed its own provisional <b>injunction</b> against Sea Shepherd. The <b>injunction</b> bars Sea Shepherd from approaching within 500 yards of ICS vessels. Sea Shepherd founder Paul Watson dismissed the opinion as [...] "entirely devoid of real evidence" [...] and claimed that Sea Shepherd USA was in full compliance with the <b>injunction.</b>|$|R

50|$|The California 6th District Court of Appeal granted Kaleidescape a {{temporary}} stay of the <b>injunction</b> on March 29, 2012.

5|$|Nonviolence is an {{overriding}} theme within the Pali Canon. While the early texts condemn killing {{in the strongest}} terms, and portray the ideal king as a pacifist, such a king is nonetheless flanked by an army. It seems that the Buddha's teaching on nonviolence was not interpreted or put into practice in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti-military-service way by early Buddhists. The early texts assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare. In Pali texts, <b>injunctions</b> to abstain from violence and involvement with military affairs are directed at members of the sangha; later Mahayana texts, which often generalise monastic norms to laity, require this of lay people as well.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{played a}} major role in passing the 1932 Norris–La Guardia Act, a federal law which {{prohibited}} employers from preventing employees from joining unions, and stopped the practice of outlawing strikes, unions, and labor organizing activities with the use of <b>injunctions.</b> The ACLU also played a key role in initiating a nationwide effort to reduce misconduct (such as extracting false confessions) within police departments, by publishing the report Lawlessness in Law Enforcement in 1931, under the auspices of Herbert Hoover's Wickersham Commission. In 1934, the ACLU lobbied for the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act, which restored some autonomy to Native American tribes, and established penalties for kidnapping Native American children.|$|E
5|$|The Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from {{granting}} <b>injunctions</b> {{against the}} Government {{or one of}} its officers. An injunction is an equitable private law remedy that restrains a public authority from doing an act that is wrongful or ultra vires. In place of an injunction, the Court may make a declaration concerning the parties' rights. At common law, there is no general right to claim damages – that is, monetary compensation – if rules of public law have been breached by an authority. In order to obtain damages, an aggrieved person {{must be able to}} establish a private law claim in contract or tort law.|$|E

5000|$|The court then {{issued a}} {{permanent}} <b>injunction</b> that [...] "dissolved and vacated" [...] the preliminary <b>injunction,</b> {{replacing it with}} an <b>injunction</b> based on a settlement between the parties. In this <b>injunction</b> the court forbade Utah Lighthouse Ministry from posting on the Internet, displaying, or reproducing the Church Handbook of Instructions. Lighthouse Ministry was further prohibited from posting on the Internet the URLs of any websites that hosted any materials from the Church Handbook of Instructions.|$|R

5|$|The {{court also}} reviews death penalty cases, state tax court appeals, and items {{regarding}} legal discipline on direct review. Direct review {{means that the}} Supreme Court hears cases directly upon appeal without the case first going to the Court of Appeals. Other direct review items include state agency decisions such as the placement of prisons, placement of energy production facilities, locations of sites for solid waste disposal, and some labor law <b>injunctions.</b> Additionally, the court has original jurisdiction in, writs of mandamus, writs quo warranto, writs of habeas corpus, reapportionment of state legislative districts, and challenges to ballot measures such as their titles, the fiscal impact statement, and the explanatory statement as listed in the Voter’s Pamphlet.|$|E
5|$|The looming {{referendum}} {{prompted a}} number of actions in the Quebec Superior Court, which were consolidated under the application of prominent lawyer Guy Bertrand. Bertrand asked for interim and permanent <b>injunctions</b> against the holding of the referendum. The Federal Attorney General declined to intervene, and after failing in a motion to strike the application, the Quebec Attorney General unilaterally withdrew from the hearing. The Quebec government moved the September sitting of the National Assembly two days forward {{to be sure that}} parliamentary immunity would prevent MNAs from being summoned to testify.|$|E
5|$|Although St. Louis {{enforced}} {{a variety}} of Jim Crow laws, the area generally had {{a lower level of}} racial violence and fewer lynchings than the American South. The St. Louis black community was stable and relatively concentrated along the riverfront or near the railroad yards. Although informal discrimination had existed in the St. Louis housing market {{since the end of the}} Civil War, only in 1916 did St. Louis pass a residential segregation ordinance. The ordinance quickly was invalidated by court <b>injunctions,</b> but private restrictive covenants in St. Louis real estate transactions limited the ability of white owners to sell to blacks and were another form of racial discrimination. In 1948 the U.S. Supreme Court overturned such real estate limitations as unconstitutional in Shelley v. Kraemer, a court case based on the sale of a St. Louis house (the Shelley House) to a black family.|$|E
