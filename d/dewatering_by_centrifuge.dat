40|$|Following benefication, product coals are {{subjected}} to mechanical <b>dewatering,</b> typically <b>by</b> <b>centrifuging</b> and vacuum filtration, to meet the specified moisture content for sale. The re-combined composite product coal size fractions are then stockpiled prior to use or transport to the port for export. On the stockpile, the product coal undergoes drainage under gravity, cycles of atmospheric drying and wetting, and wetting up due to the spraying {{of water on the}} stockpile to suppress dust. In this paper, the results of laboratory characterisation testing, atmospheric drying, and laboratory simulated wetting of stockpiled product coal are presented and discussed, leading to an improved understanding of the ex-plant drying and wetting process involved. This improved understanding can be used to optimise the design and management of product coal stockpiles to ensure the required moisture state...|$|R
