40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide {{empirical}} evidence relevant to perceptions of internal auditor independence. Specifically, this study investigates how the auditor practitioners (both internal and external auditors) perceive the importance of five selected factors that characterize the organizational settings of an internal audit department. Role theory is the frame of reference used to develop the conceptual model for this study in which the judgment of internal auditor independence is viewed as the role perception of internal auditors. A modified version of the Brunswik's lens model was developed to provide "paramorphic" representation of judgment of independence. The research methodology of this study is based upon a laboratory experiment in which a replicated factorial design was used to elicit the subjects' judgments of independence. The data collected from this experiment were analyzed by three statistical methods: conjoint measurement, multiple regression, and cluster analysis. The major findings follow. First, the five selected factors were not perceived as equally important by the subjects. In general, internal auditor's scope of audit. scope o^ service, and reporting level were perceived as more important than adequacy of organizational support. and formalization of audit policies. Second, the two groups of auditors disagree, significantly, on the relative importance of scope of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>service.</b> Third, while large individual differences existed on the relative importance of the five selected factors, the degree of judgment consensus, in general, is high within each auditor group. Fourth, the internal auditor's perceived role conflict and role ambiguity were inversely related to his perceived level of professional autonomy. Finally, the internal auditors' judgments were not notably affected by the perceptions of their own organizational environment. However, as evidenced by the different types of experienced role conflict and ambiguity, the nature of these auditors' environment varied considerably, Given the above findings, the following implications are suggested: First, the organizational settings are critical of internal auditor independence. Improperly structured settings not only affect the perceived independence but also are detrimental to professional autonomy — de facto independence. Second, rule making bodies should provide more explicit guidelines concerning internal audit independence evaluation, particularly, in the area of scope of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>service.</b> Third, while the auditor's reporting level is an important factor to independence, it should not be the only consideration.

40|$|Internal audit {{has gained}} the {{reputation}} of being a "necessary evil. " Thus, many firms are looking for alternatives to the traditional audit department. Outsourcing ofthe internal audit function is an option that has become increasingly popular over the past several years, even though it has been in existence for more than 20 years. Over one-half of the decisions to outsource have been made over the last five years. Financial institutions, specifically, {{have been one of the}} most active in the decision to outsource. According to a 1997 survey, over one-third ofthe industry has out-sourced their internal audit function. This paper investigates several specific institutions and their justifications for outsourcing (or not outsourcing), along with interviewing the institutions' outside <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> provider. The heart ofthis case study revolves around small to mid-size banks. Interviews with bank executives have lent credible and relevant knowledge to the study. The root motives behind the outsourcing of the internal audit department among smaller banks is shown to be an interrelated combination among cost and quality factors. Furthermore, the choice to outsource (or not to out source) has clearly been in the best interest of stakeholders. Smaller financial institutions are realizing that in most cases a higher quality end product can be achieved with little additional cost (or even cost savings) when the internal audit department is outsourced to a competent provider.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the nature and extent of internal audit functions’ (IAFs) involvement in environmental, social and governance assurance (ESG) and consulting in Australia. To identify emerging priorities, and the profession’s capacity to respond to these, the paper also explores internal audit practitioners’ perceptions of the current and future importance of these issues and the adequacy of their skills and expertise in meeting the challenges associated with their involvement in these areas. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from 100 Chief Audit Executives and <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>service</b> provider partners through a survey. Findings – Governance issues are a key area of focus for respondents’ assurance and consulting efforts, followed by social and environmental issues, respectively. While governance issues are perceived to be of greatest current importance to IAFs, environmental issues are most commonly expected to increase in importance over the next five years, and are reported to be in greatest need of further development of IAFs’ skills and expertise. Research limitations/implications – As the corporate landscape and expectations around transparency and accountability increase, the internal audit profession needs to address the current perceived skills gap in their ability to provide assurance and consulting on ESG issues to ensure their continued relevance and ability to meet stakeholders’ needs and expectations in providing effective integrated assurance and in contributing to internal improvements.

A second approach to measure formal <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> performance is taken by linking the other two dimensions in the context of make or buy decisions, where activity-based costing can be used to analyze <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>services</b> and cluster this service portfolio according to transaction costs or risks associated with them. Whereas the first approach uses management's expectation as a benchmark for material performance and allows for deeper analysis of deviations between the expected and the actual performance, the second approach uses the comparison of actual costs with costs of outsourcing solutions adjusted for the specific risks incurred. Both approaches are subject to further inquiry as their validity for practical and theoretical problems has not yet been evaluated.
