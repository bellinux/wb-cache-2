5|$|Like {{most other}} Asian cities, <b>driving</b> <b>is</b> the main mode of {{commuting}} in Kuala Lumpur. Hence, {{every part of}} the city is well connected by highways. As capital of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur has a comprehensive road network that leads to the rest of Peninsular Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Costly {{signalling}} can {{be applied}} to situations involving physical strain and risk of physical injury or death. Research on physical risk taking is important because information regarding why people, especially young men, take part in high risk activities can help in the development of prevention programs. Reckless <b>driving</b> <b>is</b> a lethal problem among young men in western societies. A male who takes a physical risk is sending the message that he has enough strength and skill to survive extremely dangerous activities. This signal is directed at peers and potential mates.|$|E
5|$|Truck drivers {{spend up to}} 11hours a day driving, and up to 14hours a day {{engaged in}} various duties (including driving time) such as fueling, filling out paperwork, obtaining vehicle repairs, and {{conducting}} mandatory vehicle inspections. Long-haul drivers often spend weeks away from home, spending their time off and sleeping at truck stops or rest areas. <b>Driving</b> <b>is</b> relatively dangerous work, as truck drivers account for 12 percent and the highest total number of all work-related deaths, and are five {{times more likely to}} die on the job than the average worker. Smoking, lack of exercise, unhealthy eating habits, and work-related injuries also contribute to the driver's generally risk-prone lifestyle. A survey by the National Institutes of Health found 67 percent of long-haul drivers were smokers or had quit smoking.|$|E

5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} are {{at about}} twice {{the risk of being}} involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus {{in many areas of the}} world are not allowed to drive or only able to drive if certain conditions are met. In some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to the licensing body while in others the requirement is only that they encourage the person in question to report it themselves. Countries that require physician reporting include Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Spain. Countries that require the individual to report include the UK and New Zealand and the physician may report if they believe the individual has not already. In Canada, the United States and Australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state. If seizures are well controlled most feel allowing <b>driving</b> <b>is</b> reasonable. The amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country. Many countries require one to three years without seizures. In the United States the time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year.|$|E

25|$|Driving an {{electric}} car is permissible, {{meaning that the}} action of <b>driving</b> <b>is</b> not good or bad in itself. There is no sin or reward attached to it. Most things fall under this category.|$|E
25|$|Carting, {{also known}} as dryland mushing or sulky <b>driving,</b> <b>is</b> an urban {{alternative}} to dog sledding. Here, the dog can pull a cart which contains either supplies or an individual. These carts can be bought or hand-made by the individual.|$|E
25|$|The hoop thus held {{symbolic}} meanings in Greek myth and culture. A bronze hoop {{was one of}} the toys of the infant Dionysus, and hoop <b>driving</b> <b>is</b> an attribute of Ganymede, often depicted on Greek vase paintings from the 5th century BCE. Images of the hoop are sometimes presented in the context of ancient Greek pederastic tradition.|$|E
2500|$|Offenses such as {{speeding}} {{and drink}} <b>driving</b> <b>are</b> strictly policed and penalty points can <b>be</b> imposed on <b>driving</b> licences when caught. In certain serious cases or in repeat offenses accumulating enough points a <b>driving</b> licence <b>is</b> revoked {{on a temporary}} or permanent basis.|$|R

25|$|A 2006 US study {{suggested}} that airbags and antilock brakes {{can lead to}} unsafe driving. A 2007 Canadian study {{suggested that}} unsafe drivers are habitual, and that unsafe <b>driving</b> <b>is</b> increasing. A 2009 Canadian study indicated that, after a steady decline, drinking and driving {{has been on the}} increase since 2004. These support the migration and behavioral adaptation rumble strip concerns.|$|E
25|$|Night <b>driving</b> <b>is</b> {{difficult}} and dangerous {{due to the}} blinding glare of headlights from oncoming traffic. Headlamps that satisfactorily illuminate the road ahead without causing glare have long been sought. The first solutions involved resistance-type dimming circuits, which decreased {{the intensity of the}} headlamps. This yielded to tilting reflectors, and later to dual-filament bulbs with a high and a low beam.|$|E
25|$|Drunk <b>driving</b> <b>is</b> a {{major issue}} in New Zealand, {{especially}} among young drivers. New Zealand has relatively low penalties for drunk driving. In the late 2000s, reports indicated that the rate of drunk driving by under 20s in Auckland had risen 77% in three years, with similar increases {{in the rest of the}} country. Many drunk drivers already had convictions for previous drunk driving.|$|E

25|$|In Europe, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, and Sweden have zero-tolerance {{laws for}} drugs and driving, {{as opposed to}} the other main legal {{approach}} where laws forbidding impaired <b>driving</b> <b>is</b> enacted instead. The legislation among countries that practice zero tolerance on drug use for drivers varies. Only a limited set of (common) drugs are included in the zero-tolerance legislation in Germany and Belgium, where in Finland and Sweden all controlled substances fall into the scope of zero tolerance, if they are not covered by a prescription.|$|E
25|$|Kathmandu has {{a larger}} {{proportion}} of tea drinkers than coffee drinkers. Tea is widely served but is extremely weak by western standards. It is richer and contains tea leaves boiled with milk, sugar and spices. Alcohol is widely drunk, and there are numerous local variants of alcoholic beverages. Drinking and <b>driving</b> <b>is</b> illegal, and authorities have a zero tolerance policy. Ailaa and thwon (alcohol made from rice) are the alcoholic beverages of Kathmandu, found in all the local bhattis (alcohol serving eateries). Chhyaang, tongba (fermented millet or barley) and rakshi are alcoholic beverages from other parts of Nepal which are found in Kathmandu. However, shops and bars in Kathmandu widely sell western and Nepali beers.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of mobile}} phones {{by people who}} are driving has become {{increasingly}} common, for example as part of their job, {{as in the case of}} delivery drivers who are calling a client, or socially as for commuters who are chatting with a friend. While many drivers have embraced the convenience of using their cellphone while driving, some jurisdictions have made the practice against the law, such as Australia, the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador as well as the United Kingdom, consisting of a zero-tolerance system operated in Scotland and a warning system operated in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Officials from these jurisdictions argue that using a mobile phone while <b>driving</b> <b>is</b> an impediment to vehicle operation that can increase the risk of road traffic accidents.|$|E

25|$|In reality, {{the most}} {{significant}} hazard is driving, which is made more dangerous by the severe weather. Adding still more to this hazard are the multiple distractions which can compete for a chaser's attention, such as driving, communicating with chase partners and others with a phone and/or radio, navigating, watching the sky, checking weather data, and shooting photos or video. Again here, prudence is key to minimizing the risk. Chasers ideally work to prevent the driver from multitasking either by chase partners covering the other aspects or by the driver pulling over to do these other things {{if he or she}} is chasing alone. Falling asleep while <b>driving</b> <b>is</b> a chase hazard, especially on long trips back. This also is exacerbated by nocturnal darkness and by the defatigating demands of driving through precipitation and on slick roads.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to recent}} deaths, littering, and vandalism, the {{pinnacle}} {{has been under}} strict evaluation and observation by local Shiprock Pinnacle Tribal Advocates and by two Navajo Chapter government organizations since early 2016. They oversee the area and encourage the public to not drive around the formation as an open access. Hiking, filming, and <b>driving</b> <b>is</b> all prohibited to the public due to its sacred nature and its sacred space. According to the Navajo traditionalists, there is an ecosystem of living and non-living matter {{that needs to be}} protected and unharmed. In the Navajo traditional way, people are to respect the ecosystem and not disrupt its processes. It is recommended that the public respect the Navajo people who visit on a daily basis for religious activities and other miscellaneous purposes, as it is Navajo trust land. A core/protection and buffer zones will be established soon. Local Shiprock Pinnacle Tribal Advocates and the two Navajo Chapter organizations also encourage visitors to use common sense etiquette and remember that the Navajo Nation is a sovereign, self-governed nation with rules and laws that must be followed.|$|E
25|$|To be acceptable, any {{rule of law}} must {{be capable}} of being applied consistently, thus a {{definition}} of the criteria for this qualitative analysis must be supplied. Let us assume a purely factual analysis as a starting point. A injures B and leaves him lying in the road. C is a driver who fails to see B {{on the road and}} by running over him, contributes to the cause of his death. It would be possible to ask for a detailed medical evaluation at a post mortem to determine the initial degree of injury {{and the extent to which}} B's life was threatened, followed by a second set of injuries from the collision and their contribution. If the first incident merely damaged B's leg so that he could not move, it is tempting to assert that C's driving must have been the more substantial cause and so represents a novus actus breaking the chain. Equally, if B was bleeding to death and the only contribution that the driving made was to break B's arm, the <b>driving</b> <b>is</b> not a novus actus and does not break the chain. But this approach ignores the issue of A's foresight.|$|E
