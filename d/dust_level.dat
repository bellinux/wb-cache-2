40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} evaluations examined {{the impact of}} water spray pressure, curtain setback distance, and external and underboom spray use for controlling respirable <b>dust</b> <b>levels</b> and sulfur hexafluoride tracer gas concentrations around a continuous mining machine. This mining machine was equipped with a flooded-bed dust scrubber and was positioned in the box or slab cut. Exhaust line brattice was used for all tests. <b>Dust</b> <b>levels</b> were measured in the return airway and at locations representing the operators of the continuous mining machine and the standard and off-standard shuttle cars. Increasing water pressure or using the underboom sprays produced no significant impacts on <b>dust</b> <b>levels,</b> although their interactions did produce some significant impacts. Increasing curtain setback distance often elevated <b>dust</b> <b>levels,</b> likely by {{reducing the amount of}} airflow reaching the face. Use of the external sprays created additional airflow around the mining machine that pushed the dust cloud past the scrubber inlets. This significantly increased <b>dust</b> <b>levels</b> at all sampling locations. Tracer gas levels were measured on the off-curtain and curtain sides of the cutter head and in the return airway. Increasing water pressure generally led to significantly increased gas levels on the curtain side, although a slight decrease was observed on the off-curtain side with the machine in the box cut. Increasing setback distance elevated gas levels {{on both sides of the}} cutter head and in the return by limiting the quantity of ventilation airflow reaching the face. Use of the external sprays provided additional airflow along the off-curtain side of the machine, significantly reducing gas levels in this region. These sprays adversely impacted the dilution and removal of gas on the curtain side of the cutter head. Use of the underboom sprays adversely impacted gas levels on both sides of the cutter head. Use of the external sprays provided the best control of respirable dust and face gas concentrations. The smaller increases in miner operator <b>dust</b> <b>levels</b> produced by these sprays were offset by larger reductions in face gas levels on the off-curtain side of the cutter head.

Dust and coal samples were obtained from 20 longwalls operating in geographically representative coalfields throughout the United States. Statistical analyses of coal seam parameters and airborne respirable dust measurements indicate a likely causal relationship between seam type and respirable dust. Low-ash, high-volatile coal seams were associated with higher airborne respirable dust levels.

Dust controls commonly used on drills include a dry dust collection system, exhausting from a shrouded area around the collared hole, and an enclosed drill operator cab, filtering airborne dust from the cab. Bulldozers are also typically equipped with an enclosed operator cab as a dust control measure. Airborne respirable dust sampling was conducted near each equipment's source of generation and inside its enclosed cab. Silica analysis {{was performed on the}} dust samples to determine the percent silica content in the dust generated at the six mining operations. An additional eight- month follow-up of dust sampling was also conducted in the enclosed operator cabs of several rock drills and bulldozers.

We investigated this possibility using a palaeocommunity approach. We compared microwear texture differences between eastern and southern African Hominini, along with Plio-Pleistocene specimens representing two tribes of bovids, Alcelaphini and Antilopini, from the same deposits as the early hominins. If exogenous grit swamps diet signals, we would expect community-wide microwear patterns separating samples by region. Results indicate that each of the three tribes shows a different pattern of variation of microwear textures between eastern and southern Africa.

Based on correlation test, researcher concluded that age is not associated with iritant contact dermatitis (p-value = 0, 368), there is no correlation between years of service with the occurrence of irritant contact dermatitis (p-value = 0, 182), there is no correlation between personal hygiene with the occurrence of irritant contact dermatitis (p-value = 0, 689), and wood dust exposure is associated with iritant contact dermatitis (p-value = 0, 005). Researcher suggested that workers need to wash their hands before and after working with hand soap, and the company need to educate workers the effect of wood dust exposure related to the occurrence of irritant contact dermatitis...|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to find an}} alternative method for fine dust control in the pre-exiting facilities of metro-subway stations. A new double-layer design was proposed for the MVAC (mechanical ventilation and air control) system. Several filter lay-outs were combined a pre-filter with electret filter (EF), electret bundle filter (EBF), or electret pleated filter (EPF), and were then examined focusing on the collection efficiency of particulate matters and pressure drop across the filter layers. The experimental results from the lab and field tests showed the best collection efficiency with EPF, which achieved 85 % for PM 10 and 55 % for PM 2. 5. It was also found from the long term field test that the new filter lay-out could provide quite consistent <b>dust</b> <b>level</b> particularly in undergroun...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was done to assess cement dust {{exposure}} {{and its relationship to}} respiratory health effects, both acute and chronic respiratory symptoms and ventilatory function impairment among Portland cement factory workers in Khash located in the south part of Iran. A cross-sectional study was conducted at Khash Portland cement producing factory in Iran in 2001. A total of 170 exposed and 170 unexposed employees were selected. Air transmitted personal respirable dust and total dust samples were collected in a full-time (8 h/day) shift. <b>Dust</b> <b>level</b> was determined by the gravimetric method. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect information and history of respiratory health among workers (exposed and unexposed to dust) and measurements of lung function were made using a spirometer in both groups. Concentrations of personal respirable dust ranged from 3. 7 mg/m 3 in the kilns to 23 mg/m 3 in the ore crushing area, and total dust ranged from 15 mg/m 3 in the kilns to 95 mg/m 3. Cough and phlegm, with or without shortness of breath, were significantly related to dust concentration. Measuring pulmonary functions of workers exposed to dust and unexposed group showed a significant decrease in vital capacity, forced vital capacity, FEF 25 - 75 and Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (P< 0. 05). Findings suggest that occupational exposure to Portland cement dust may lead to higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms and the reduction of ventilator capacity due to existence of quartz in row material of cement dusts. The study revealed that cement dust exposure is associated with acute as well as chronic respiratory health effects. It is recommended that engineering measures must be taken to reduce the <b>dust</b> <b>level</b> in cement factories, accompanied with health monitoring of exposed employees...|$|E
40|$|This project {{resulted}} from an alleged dust problem affecting the residents in a Florida community. The residents claimed {{that there were}} elevated <b>dust</b> <b>levels</b> caused by a rock quarry adjacent to their homes. The purpose of this work was to assess total particulate, respirable particulate, and the coarse content of the sampled particles through traditional NIOSH methods, and using a new, real-time instrument known as the EPAM 5000. Data from the EPAM and NIOSH methods were compared to the EPA 2 ̆ 7 s particulate matter standards and the OSHA permissible exposure limits for total and respirable <b>dust.</b> <b>Dust</b> <b>levels</b> using the NIOSH methods were below the limit of detection. There were measurable <b>dust</b> <b>levels</b> in all three size fractions (PM 10, PM[subscript 2. 5], PM 1) for the EPAM. Due to the undetectable levels of the NIOSH method sampling, further sampling in a laboratory environment was conducted in order to compare NIOSH methods with the EPAM 5000 method. The project continued into an aerosol chamber in the USF College of Public Health Breath Lab for further data collection in order to compare results using traditional NIOSH methods with the results obtained from the EPAM 5000. The chamber {{was associated with a}} dust generator that released a steady flow of fly ash particulate at a specific revolution per minute (rpm). Each run of data collection sampled approximately 1 m³ of air and persisted for six to seven hours. Four separate runs were conducted, each at a different generation rate of fly ash. There were measurable <b>dust</b> <b>levels</b> using the NIOSH total dust and NIOSH respirable dust methods. There were also measurable <b>dust</b> <b>levels</b> in all three size fractions (PM 10, PM[subscript 2. 5], PM 1) for the EPAM. The results of all methods were compared. The PM[subscript 2. 5] and PM 1 sampling heads of the EPAM 5000 were compared to the NIOSH respirable dust sampling results. The PM 10 sampling head of the EPAM was compared to the NIOSH total dust sampling results. NIOSH 0500 concentration results were within 10...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} of an electrostatic precipitator {{dust collection system}} was conducted to determine its ability to remove dust particles from common swine facilities. The system was installed in farrowing and nursery settings, and <b>dust</b> <b>levels</b> were subsequently measured in rooms both with and without the precipitators. It was determined that the collectors reduced total <b>dust</b> <b>levels</b> in the nursery environment by 58 % (with a 36 % reduction in respirable particles), and in the farrowing environment by 45 % (with a 50 % reduction in respirable particles). Throughout this study {{it was evident that}} the construction, installation, and operation of this collection system was not only technically feasible, but was also practical for commercial swine production operations...|$|R
