The situation undermines the Fund's relevance and legitimacy in promoting global growth and economic and financial stability. A new simplified and transparent formula to guide the distribution of <b>Fund</b> <b>quotas</b> is key to IMF reform. The authors offer four recommendations to advance IMF quota reform: (1) The IMF executive board should complete its work on the new IMF quota formula by the 2007 annual meeting [...] rather than spring 2008 [...] to ensure that the other necessary elements of a reform package can be completed by spring 2008 and ratified by the IMF governors at their annual meeting in fall 2008. (2) The new quota formula should follow the recommendations of the quota formula review group (QFRG), deleting an "openness" measure from the formula. The openness variable has no economic or financial justification, and the traditional measures are biased. (3) The traditional industrial countries should agree to a target of limiting their quota shares to 60 percent of their GDP shares to facilitate the further redistribution of quota shares toward the nonindustrial countries. (4) A reasonable benchmark would be an increase in the size of the <b>Fund</b> (total <b>quotas)</b> by at least 50 percent to implement the redistribution of quota and voting shares under the new quota formula. ...|$|R

Such doubts, indeed, are {{not confined to}} the banking industry. In the face of home grown problems of unemployment or health-care, for instance, democratically elected governments of donor countries are finding themselves under increasing pressure from their voters to cut back on bilateral assistance to hopelessly indebted taker-states. Multilateral lending and development institutions are facing an uncertain future, trapped in the vicious circle of bad debts that are all-too-steadily increasing, capital and <b>funding</b> <b>quotas</b> that are failing to materialize (eyes are currently on the US Congress), and borrowing that is becoming ever-more expensive. The African Development Bank is faltering; a Middle East Development Bank is in danger of being stillborn. The World Bank has recently been trying bravely to redress the balance: it has created a ‘multilateral debt facility' for the most severely-indebted countries, and devised a numerical scale of national well-being that is more appropriate for the measurement of ecologically sustainable development than GNP per head of population. While these initiatives should not be belittled, good ideas are too often murdered by gangs of ugly fact...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} a framework for appraising new financial instruments and evaluating {{the extent to which}} they can help alleviate problems of incomplete credit markets and contingent claims markets in developing countries. Although the issues involved apply to any new financial instrument, we give particular attention to commodity-linked securities because many developing countries specialize in producing a handful of primary commodities and are therefore exposed to subst-antial commodity price risks. The article looks at the supply of, demand for, and pricing of commodity-linked securities and discuss-es some issues that affect their use by developing countries: their special legal status as sovereign debt; their feasibility (since to become truly effective they will require liquid secondary markets); and the construction of an optimal portfolio of external debt obligations. It also discusses the potential for new financial instruments-particularly commodity-linked securities-as a tool for risk management in developing countries. O ver the years economists and policymakers have suggested a number of ways to reduce and manage the commodity price risks facing developing countries. Schemes to stabilize commodity prices-buffer stocks, buffer <b>funds,</b> <b>quotas,</b> and variable export taxes-have been the most common remedy because when credit and contingent claims markets are in-complete, stabilization schemes can reduce and redistribute risks and thereby increase economic efficiency (Newbery and Stiglitz 1981). But economists have become disillusioned with price stabilization schemes. For one thing, they force everyone to accept the same degree of stability. There is no way for farmer...|$|R

In 2011, NOAA Fisheries {{implemented}} catch {{shares in}} the US west coast groundfish trawl fishery to benefit both fish and fishermen. Once these catch shares could be traded, well-capitalized organizations such as processors had an advantage over individual operators in that they could act quickly when shares become available on the market.

40|$|The International Monetary Fund {{is at an}} impasse, acutely {{short of}} secure lending resources.

This is not a solid foundation for the nearest thing the world system has to an international lender-of-last- resort. Since the IMF's multilateral functions cannot be readily replicated, it is important to find a way out. All solutions lead back to the US veto, the US being the only state (Treasury or Congress) able to veto supermajority decisions. The prospect of more financial crises ahead while the Fund is chronically short of secure lending resources should focus all minds on how to end the US veto. Otherwise the Fund will follow the WTO towards irrelevance, to the benefit of the few countries at the strong end of bilateral and regional arrangements...|$|R

A gender-inclusive approach is needed to include men {{as well as women}} in the discussion, and curricula reforms have to be taken seriously.

40|$|BRIDGE is an {{initiative}} {{funded by the}} Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT) that aims to close the “funding gap” between basic and applied research in stand-alone projects with the primary objective of jointly developing the potential of basic and applied research. BRIDGE acts as an umbrella structure under which the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) and the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) coordinate two thematically open funding programmes: The FWF’s Translational Research Programme (TR) and the FFG’s bridging programme (BR). The two programmes differ from one another in respect of the research’s potential to lead to specific applications and in respect of their funding intensity, which since the second call {{has resulted in the}} division of BR into two sub-programmes (Bridge 1 and Bridge 2). · The TR programme funds projects that meet high international standards of scientific quality {{while at the same time}} offering innovation potential in terms of the expected application, but for which no commercially-oriented financing partner has been found. Applications may be made by individuals; the approved costs may be funded in full. · In the case of the BR programme, applications may be submitted by research institutes and companies but also by individual researchers. The consortium must include at least two partners (1 from science, 1 from industry). - Bridge 1 supports collaborative research projects where most of the project costs (at least 80 %) are borne by the research institute or the researcher. The enterprises that will potentially implement the results make a financial contribution and also provide material and manpower (maximum 20 %); the maximum amount of funding is 75 %. Applications may be made by institutions. - In the case of Bridge 2 much of the project work is still carried out by the scientific partner (at least 30 %). However, the corporate partner makes a greater contribution to the project in the form of material and manpower; the maximum <b>funding</b> <b>quota</b> here is 60 %. In the years 2004 - 2008 BRIDGE had a budget of EUR 92 million for seven calls, the equivalent of EUR 10 - 11. 6 million per year and programme line with two calls in each year. 7. Total funding of EUR 85 million was approved; EUR 40 million for 187 TR projects and EUR 44 million for 187 B 1 and 72 B 2 projects within the framework of BR. BR has a considerably higher average application approval rate (49 %) than TR (29 %). When the programme was launched it was agreed that BRIDGE would be subjected to a mid-term evaluation after three to five years in accordance with the recommendation made by the Austrian Council for Research and Technology Development. After being hired to carry out this evaluation in October 2008 Technopolis analysed the concept, implementation, processes and organisation, goal achievement, and as far as they could be determined, the impacts of the programme. In comparison with other programme evaluations, two questions are of particular relevance. The first concerns the perceived funding gap: Did it really exist? Was it necessary and appropriate to launch an additional programme? The second question concerns the culture of cooperation initiated between the FFG and FWF, which for the first time are managing research funding programmes under a joint name and with a joint programme advisory committee. Among other things, this evaluation examines the question of how productive this model is and to what extent it should be continued in the future. For this purpose, qualitative and quantitative methods were combined, including in particular an analysis of programme documents and material from the BRIDGE advisory committee, interviews with the programme managers and stakeholders, an analysis of the FWF and FFG monitoring data, an online survey of applicants for TR funding and the scientific partners in BR 1 and BR 2 applications (project leaders and partners), as well as four international case studies. Results 1. BRIDGE did close a funding gap, but sometimes also overlapped with other programmes. 2. The BRIDGE advisory committee serves as the bridge between the two funding agencies and is the backbone of the programme. 3. High percentage of new funding recipients at the two funding agencies 4. Mobilisation of new and existing partnerships 5. Importance of BRIDGE for the development of human resource...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a product of a University of Zimbabwe-University of Oslo {{sandwich}} programme. The ï¬eldwork for the thesis was done at the University of Zimbabwe. The coursework and write-up were done at the University of Oslo.,The thesis assesses the contribution of dictionary-making in Ndebele on the standardisation of the language. The production of the monolingual Ndebele dictionary,Isichazamazwi SesiNdebele (ISN), raised a number of issues that have implications on the standardisation of Ndebele. There was the question of whether to keep Ndebele close to Zulu as the former has always depended on the latter for grammar books, dictionaries, and even creative literature. Actually, Ndebele in Zimbabwe is taught alongside Zulu conï¬ rming the belief held by many that Ndebele is a dialect of Zulu. Previously only Zulu was offered at secondary school in the place of Ndebele. Basing the ISN entirely on the Ndebele language corpus meant the exclusion of Zulu. The possibility of abandoning Zulu poses two problems: ï¬rst, Zulu is prestigious among the Ndebele and abandoning it might lead to the rejection of the ISN; and second, if Zulu is no longer setting the standard, then a new norm should be found. The corpus showed that Ndebele has regional varieties, contrary to often-held views, making the choice of a norm for a standard a difficult one. Language standardisation as part of language planning is usually sanctioned by government departments or similarly authorised language boards, but other agents of standardisation like lexicographers are equally important. That is why the thesis focuses {{on the role of the}} ISN on the standardisation of Ndebele. Although editors of the ISN claimed to be descriptive in their dictionary, no dictionary can be entirely descriptive. Editors had to make decisions on vocabulary selection, on senses, pronunciation,spelling and terminology, as well as which loanwords to include and how to spell them. In that way, the standardising role of the ISN on Ndebele is a by-product of the dictionary-making process rather than the purpose of making the dictionary. Areas of standardisation investigated include vocabulary, terminology and orthography in chapters 6, 7 and 8 respectively. On Ndebele vocabulary, loanwords pose some challenges. Partial language purism has been observed on loanwords in Ndebele. Words from Zulu and other Nguni languages are accepted in Ndebele while those from other African languages tend to be resisted. There is also resistance to loanwords from European languages like English and from Afrikaans although many words from these languages have become part of the Ndebele lexicon. The language situation in Zimbabwe where African languages are conï¬ned to the unoficial domain has led to an underdevelopment of terminology in almost all the ï¬elds. The focus has been on term development in linguistics, literature, law, and in the natural sciences. The various possible ways of term-development in Ndebele were discussed. The lack of updated rules on Ndebele orthography poses problems to writers and the same problems were faced in the compilation of the ISN. Word division of compounds poses serious problems and the editors of the ISN did not resolve the inconsistency. The spelling of loanwords is problematic too. The ISN lemmatised words with, a symbol representing a sound that some Ndebele speakers believe should not be part of the Ndebele phonology. I have shown in this research some loanwords that have come into the language and the challenges they posed in spelling and word division. The thesis covers and combines aspects of language planning, lexicography and corpus linguistics. Approaches from these seemingly distinct disciplines were harmonised and exploited in answering language standardisation problems in Ndebele. Sociolinguistics has no unifying theory, neither have language planning and lexicography. In this research, I did not attempt to conï¬ ne myself to any particular theory or approach, but I used relevant aspects from a number of theoretical approaches. The Ndebele language corpus is the main source of linguistic evidence in the form of concordances. Those aspects of the Ndebele language that have undergone or need to undergo standardisation as a result of the inï¬‚ uence of the ISN are shown in the thesis. Problem areas in Ndebele lexicography are highlighted, problems that lexicographers have to address in future works. Finally, I have shown that Zulu has not been dropped entirely as the norm for Ndebele, even if the ISN claims to be corpus-based. This illustrates the editorsâ€™ concern for sociolinguistic factors over purely linguistic factors in their decisions. Therefore, decisions made in the ISN as well as on Ndebele language standardisation were inï¬‚uenced more by sociolinguistic reality as perceived by editors than purely academic and linguistic factors.,The funding for the thesis was made available through the Norwegian Education Loan <b>Fund,</b> the <b>Quota</b> Programme loan and grant.
