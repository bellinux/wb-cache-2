40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} direct feedback of temperature conditions followed by a telephone educational questionnaire to correct adverse vaccine storage, and to determine the consistency of vaccine storage conditions at provider sites over six months. PARTICIPANTS: 32 general practitioner vaccine providers in metropolitan Adelaide. DESIGN: Temperatures were monitored for 14 days using electronic temperature monitors, with repeat monitoring at two and six months. Feedback was given to vaccine providers and an educational questionnaire was administered after initial monitoring. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Number of sites with more than 20 % of recordings 8 degrees C and/or more than 5 % of recordings 15 degrees C. RESULTS: 13 (41 %) sites had initially suboptimal <b>storage.</b> Following the <b>interventions,</b> <b>storage</b> was corrected in all but three (23 %) of these sites. Only 10 (52 %) of the 19 initially optimal sites had consistent optimal storage at two and six months. CONCLUSION: Electronic monitoring with direct feedback of storage temperatures was effective in correcting adverse storage at most suboptimal sites. Vaccine storage at initially optimal sites was not consistent.

Here we report that PGRN binds directly to GCase and its deficiency results in aggregation of GCase and its receptor LIMP 2. Mass spectrometry approaches identified HSP 70 as a GCase/LIMP 2 complex-associated protein upon stress, with PGRN as an indispensable adaptor. Additionally, 98 amino acids of C-terminal PGRN, referred to as Pcgin, are required and sufficient for the binding to GCase and HSP 70. Pcgin effectively ameliorates the disease phenotype in GD patient fibroblasts and animal models.

Energy management {{is one of the}} most demanding issues within such urban centres owing to the complexity of the energy systems and their vital role. Therefore, significant attention and effort need to be dedicated to this problem. Modelling and simulation are the major tools commonly used to assess the technological and policy impacts of smart solutions, as well as to plan the best ways of shifting from current cities to smarter ones. This paper reviews energy-related work on planning and operation models within the smart city by classifying their scope into five main <b>intervention</b> areas: generation, <b>storage,</b> infrastructure, facilities, and transport. More-complex urban energy models integrating more than one intervention area are also reviewed, outlining their advantages and limitations, existing trends and challenges, and some relevant applications. Lastly, a methodology for developing an improved energy model in the smart-city context is proposed, along with some additional final recommendations. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the links that exist between the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Communities (EC) and the EC budget. In particular, the thesis {{examines}} {{the impact on the}} budget of reforming the CAP. It shows that the nature of support offered under the CAP up to the 1992 MacSharry reforms has a strong historical precedent in French and German history. It then goes on to examine in greater detail the support mechanisms of the cereals and oilseeds sectors. The cereals sector is focused on because of its importance in agricultural output and in total agricultural support expenditure by the EC. Oilseeds is considered for its policy linkages with cereals in both production and consumption. The detailed nature of expenditures on these sectors is examined in detail, with particular emphasis placed on costs and policy problems arising out of <b>intervention</b> <b>storage.</b> In forecasting future expenditures under different policy scenarios, cereals production and consumption are considered separately. Imports, exports and intervention behaviour are also considered, to permit the examination of all aspects of the cereals market that affect expenditure. The impact of the 1992 MacSharry reforms is compared to a strict continuation of the 1988 stabiliser reforms and a price freeze at 1992 levels for the forecast period to 1999. It is shown that the impact of the 1992 reforms is to reduce the extent of the market imbalances by 1999 as compared with the base scenarios, but unless the level of compensatory payment is cut, then by 1999, the EC faces a support bill that is higher under the new policy than would have been the case had the 1988 reforms been retained...|$|E

Small multi-purpose reservoirs are a widely used form of infrastructure for {{the provision of}} water. They supply water for domestic use, livestock watering, small scale irrigation, and other beneficial uses. The reservoirs are hydrologically linked by the streams that have been dammed. Although reservoirs store a large quantity of water and {{have a significant effect on}} downstream flows, they have rarely been considered as systems, with synergies and tradeoffs resulting from the number and density of their structures. Often reservoirs were constructed in a series of projects funded by different agencies, at different times, with little or no coordination among the implementing partners. A significant number are functioning sub-optimally and/or are falling into disrepair. This indicates that there is room for improvement in the planning, operation, and maintenance of small reservoirs. The water management institutions in Volta, Limpopo, and Sao Francisco Basins are being revamped to better serve their constituencies. We have an opportunity to collaborate with government officials, stakeholders, and farmers who are actively looking for ways to improve the planning process. The Small Reservoir Project team developed a tool kit to support the planning, development, and management of small reservoir ensembles on the basin level and the use of small multi-purpose reservoirs that are properly located, well designed, operated and maintained in sustainable fashion, and economically viable on the local/community level. There are tools to improve <b>intervention</b> planning, <b>storage</b> estimation and the analysis of the hydrology, ecology and health of small reservoirs.

Non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) are found in water, {{but there is little}} research on whether NTM survive POU treatment. Mycobacteria may be removed by multi-barrier treatment systems that combine processes such as coagulation, settling and disinfection. This work evaluated removal of a non-tuberculous Mycobacterium (Mycobaterium terrae) and a Gram-negative non-acid-fast environmental bacterium (Aeromonas hydrophila) by combined coagulation-flocculation disinfection POU treatment. Aeromonas hydrophila showed 7. 7 log 10 reduction in demand free buffer, 6. 8 log 10 in natural surface water, and 4 log 10 reduction in fecally contaminated surface water. Turbidity after treatment was < 1 NTU. There was almost no reduction in levels of viable M. terrae by coagulant-flocculant-disinfectant in natural water after 30 minutes. The lack of Mycobacteria reduction was similar for both combined coagulant-flocculant-disinfectant and hypochlorite alone. A POU coagulant-flocculant-disinfectant treatment effectively reduced A. hydrophila from natural surface waters but not Mycobacteria. These results reinforce previous findings that POU coagulation-flocculation-disinfection is effective against gram-negative enteric bacteria.

40|$|Cool {{storage is}} a load {{management}} strategy for air conditioning loads, which shifts peak load by storing cooling capacity during off peak period. It allows the customer's electricity use for cooling to be shifted to off peak period, benefiting both the consumer and the utility. Reduction in peak demand and electricity cost depend on electricity tariff rates, operating strategy, cool storage capacity and climatic conditions. In this paper, a methodology {{is presented to}} determine the optimal chilled water storage (CWS) capacity and corresponding operating strategy for the air conditioning loads for different electricity tariffs. This model minimizes the total operating cost of the air conditioning plant by a trade-off between the cost involved for providing the storage and accessories and savings achieved under the specified, electricity tariff. A case study for a typical office complex shows that a reduction of 38 % in peak demand is possible by adopting the optimal CWS strategy under time of use (TOU) tariff. The corresponding saving in the operating cost for the consumer is 5. 9 %. The results show that under flat tariffs, the prevalent high consumer discount rates make cool storage unviable.

This study reports on the efficiency and productivity of a typical small-scale irrigation scheme in the highlands of the Blue Nile, Ethiopia. Canal water flows and the volume of irrigation water applied were measured at field level. Grain and crop residue biomass and grass biomass production along the canals were also measured. To triangulate the measurements, the irrigation farm management, effects of water logging around irrigation canals, farm water distribution mechanisms, effects of night irrigation and water losses due to soil cracking created by prolonged irrigation were closely observed. The average canal water loss from the main, the secondary and the field canals was 2. 58, 1. 59 and 0. 39 l s− 1 100 m− 1, representing 4. 5, 4. 0 and 26 % of the total water flow respectively. About 0. 05 % of the loss was attributed to grass production for livestock, while the rest was lost through evaporation and canal seepage. Grass production for livestock feed had a land productivity of 6190. 5 kg ha− 1 and a water productivity of 0. 82 kg m− 3. Land productivity for straw and grain was 2048 and 770 kg ha− 1, respectively, for teff, and 1864 kg ha− 1 and 758 kg ha− 1, respectively, for wheat. Water productivities of the crops varied from 0. 2 to 1. 63 kg m− 3. A significant volume of water was lost from small-scale irrigation systems mainly because farmers’ water application did not match crop needs.

Please note that although {{commonly referred to as}} the BioSand Filter, the BioSand Filter terminology is trademarked to one particular design, and this fact sheet encompasses all slow sand filters. The version most widely implemented consists of layers of sand and gravel in a concrete or plastic container approximately 0. 9 meters tall and 0. 3 meters square. The water level is maintained to 5 - 6 cm above the sand layer by setting the height of the outlet pipe. This shallow water layer allows a bioactive layer to grow on top of the sand, which contributes to the reduction of disease-causing organisms. A diffuser plate is used to prevent disruption of the biolayer when water is added. To use the filter, users simply pour water into the top, and collect finished water out of the outlet pipe into a bucket. Over time, especially if source water is turbid, the flow rate can decrease. Users can maintain flow rate by cleaning the filter through agitating the top level of sand, or by pre-treating turbid water before filtration.

Weeds, insects and diseases are described but identification in modern terms is not easy. The pre-modern ‘Crop Portfolio’ is well filled, certainly in the Mediterranean area. The medieval ‘Pest Portfolio’ differs from the modern one because agriculture then was a Low External Input Agriculture, and because the proportion of cultivated to non-cultivated land was drastically lower than today. The pre-modern ‘Control Portfolio’ is surprisingly rich, both in preventive and interventive measures. Prevention was by risk management, intensive tillage, and careful <b>storage.</b> <b>Intervention</b> was mechanical and chemical. Chemical intervention used natural substances such as sulphur, pitch, and ‘botanicals’. Some fifty plant species are mentioned in a crop protection context. Though application methods look rather modern they are typically low-tech. Among them are seed disinfection, spraying, dusting, fumigation, grease banding, wound care, and hand-picking but also scarification, now outdated. The reality of pest outbreaks and other damages is explored as to frequency, intensity, and extent. Information on the practical use of the recommended treatments is scanty. If applied, their effectiveness remains enigmatic. Three medieval agronomists are at the heart of this book, but historical developments in crop protection from early Punic, Greek, and Roman authors to the first modern author are outlined. The readership of these writers was the privileged class of landowners but hints pointing to the exchange of ideas between them and the common peasant were found. Consideration is given to the pre-modern reasoning in matters of crop protection. Comparison of pre-modern crop protection and its counterpart in modern organic agriculture is difficult because of drastic changes in the relation between crop areas and non-crop areas, and because of the great difference in yield levels then and now, with several associated differences...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Clinical {{guidelines}} for denture care are available, but evidence for optimal nocturnal storage is scarce. The {{aim of the}} study was to compare the role of the overnight storage state on plaque growth and composition on acrylic removable dentures. METHODS: In a parallel-group randomized controlled trial of 51 institutionalized participants, 3 denture overnight preservation methods were considered: (i) in water, (ii) dry or (iii) in water with added alkaline peroxide-based cleansing tablet. Biofilm samples were taken on day 7 (developing biofilm - dBF) and day 14 (maturing biofilm - mBF) from a mechanically uncleaned, standardized region, situated distally to the second lower premolars. Total and individual levels of selected perio-pathogenic and commensal species (n= 20), and of Candida albicans were calculated by PCR. Differences between storage conditions (water/dry/tablet) and between the samples (dBF/mBF) were assessed by means of unpaired and paired t-tests respectively, with α= 5 %. RESULTS: Overnight denture storage with cleansing tablet significantly decreased the total bacterial level of dBF and mBF up to 13. 8 %. Fn, Ec, Cs, Sc, Ao and Vp counts were particularly affected by tablet care. Significant lower amounts of Candida albicans for tablet storage compared to water preservation were recorded in dBF and mBF (- 69. 3 ± 3. 8 % and - 75. 9 ± 3. 2 % respectively). The mass and pathogenicity of dBF and mBF was equal, irrespective of the overnight <b>storage</b> <b>intervention.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The use of cleansing tablets for acrylic removable denture overnight storage reduces denture biofilm mass and pathogenicity compared to dry and water preservation, and may contribute to the overall systemic health.

Significant lower amounts of Candida albicans for tablet storage compared to water preservation were recorded in dBF and mBF (− 69. 3 ± 3. 8 % and − 75. 9 ± 3. 2 % respectively). The mass and pathogenicity of dBF and mBF was equal, irrespective of the overnight <b>storage</b> <b>intervention.</b> ConclusionsThe use of cleansing tablets for acrylic removable denture overnight storage reduces denture biofilm mass and pathogenicity compared to dry and water preservation, and may contribute to the overall systemic health. Clinical significanceEvidence-based clinical {{guidelines for}} overnight storage of removable acrylic dentures are lacking. The findings of this study indicate that alkaline peroxide-based cleansing tablets decrease bacterial and Candida levels in denture biofilms in case of poor oral hygiene. This provides evidence for a clinical guideline to minimize microbial load of dentures, thereby reducing associated systemic health risks...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Boiling is {{the most}} common method of {{household}} water treatment in low- and middle-income countries, however, it is not always effectively practiced. We examined factors associated with Escherichia coli contamination of improved water supplies among 207 households in a rural population in Peru that practiced boiling. We subsequently conducted a randomized controlled trial among these households to assess the effectiveness of water pasteurization and safe <b>storage</b> <b>interventions</b> in reducing Escherichia coli contamination of household drinking water. Households were randomized to three study groups: two intervention groups that received either a safe storage container or a safe storage container plus water pasteurization indicator and a control group that continued usual practices. Although over 90 % of households used an improved water source at baseline, 47 % of source and 43 % of stored water samples were contaminated with E. coli. Pouring or using a spigot to obtain water from the storage container instead of dipping a hand or object was associated with decreased risk of contamination of stored water (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 0. 58, 95 % CI= 0. 42, 0. 80). Container cleanliness (aPR= 0. 67, 95 % CI= 0. 45, 1. 00) and correct handwashing technique (aPR= 0. 62, 95 % CI= 0. 42, 0. 90) were also associated with decreased contamination risk. During a 13 -week follow-up period, households that received a safe storage container and water pasteurization indicator had a higher prevalence of stored drinking water contamination relative to the control group, although the difference was not statistically significant (Prevalence Ratio (PR) : 1. 20, 95 % CI: 0. 94, 1. 52). Receipt of only a safe storage container had no effect on the contamination of stored drinking water (PR: 1. 02, 95 % CI: 0. 79, 1. 31). Although use of low-cost water pasteurization indicators and locally available storage containers did not significantly increase the safety of household drinking water in this study, future research could help illuminate factors that facilitate the use of these interventions to effectively improve water quality and reduce the risk of waterborne disease in populations that boil drinking water...|$|R
40|$|On October 1 st, 2013, {{a mandate}} {{was adopted by}} the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) {{requiring}} that 1. 325 GW of energy storage capability be installed on the California electricity grid by 2024, through the actions of the state’s three investor-owned utilities. While this is a bold first step towards mandated energy storage in the United States, it may be only the beginning for an energy storage industry in this state. It has been well established that energy storage would prove to be a useful asset on the California electrical grid, but the development of storage capacity past the requirements of the mandate will depend upon whether storage can be made cost-effective. Much of the value that storage creates is a public good: many storage applications allow the grid to operate more efficiently as a whole, but not necessarily in a way that can be monetized by any particular party. As a public good, these systemic benefits of storage capacity will be supplied sub-optimally in the absence of government <b>intervention.</b> The energy <b>storage</b> industry will accordingly be one that is strongly affected by the tides of change in technology, regulation and economics in the California energy market. This report will focus primarily on the intersection of the second two of these factors, largely leaving the technological questions to more well-informed parties while seeking to establish what regulatory and economic considerations might be undertaken to ensure that the road to deployment of appropriate energy storage systems is made as clear as possible so that this technology can reach the socially efficient level on the California electricity grid. It is the aim of this report not to promote a specific technology or even an energy storage industry, but rather to shed some light on the effects that the development of such an industry could have on the California electricity market and the energy use paradigm that governs modern electricity grids worldwide. With the adoption of AB 2514, a grand experiment was set in motion that will benefit the entire world as California tests the uncharted technological, regulatory and economic territories of grid-scale energy storage capacity. It is a time of change in the electricity industry, and energy storage is a potentially transformative technology that could very well enable the shattering of an energy use paradigm that has held the world captive to fossil fuels for over a century...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{response}} to population growth, rising income and urbanisation, {{the demand for}} livestock products, such as milk, meat and eggs is growing in Ethiopia. The growing demand for milk products offers opportunities for smallholders to realize better livelihoods. Whereas the growing demand for milk products in Ethiopia is widely recognised, the dairy sector {{has not been able}} to produce adequate milk to satisfy this demand, mainly due to low productivity of dairy animals. The use of technological inputs, such as improved breeds of dairy cows and cultivation of improved forages, is often seen as a prerequisite to increasing livestock productivity and resource use efficiency in the smallholder dairy sector. However, adoption of such technologies has been low, despite numerous efforts to disseminate the technologies in the past. This poses a question as to why the majority of smallholders have not adopted livestock technologies in the Ethiopian highlands. The overall objective of this study was understanding the factors affecting adoption of technologies that enhance the productivity of livestock production and water use efficiency in the Ethiopian highlands, with particular emphasis on dairy production. The study was intended to deepen the understanding on the role of factors at the levels of farm households, value chains and macroeconomic institutions and policies on farmers’ decision to adopt technologies. The study employed interdisciplinary approach to analyse micro and macro level constraints that affect adoption of technologies in livestock production. The findings in the empirical chapters show that low adoption of the technologies that enhance the productivity of livestock production and water use efficiency stem from farmers’ limited access to farm resources, differentials in potential welfare impacts of the technologies, lack of effective and reliable supply chains for inputs and outputs, inadequate physical infrastructure and weak institutions and policies. The findings show that smallholders have been subjected to multiple constraints. Given the multiple constraints at different scales and the associated transaction costs facing smallholders in rural Ethiopia, the returns to investment for the technologies may be too low to justify widespread adoption of the technologies. Therefore, adoption of technologies in the dairy sector requires <b>interventions</b> at production, <b>storage,</b> transportation, processing and marketing chains and at macroeconomic institutions and policies. In the short and medium term, dairy development programs in Ethiopia will have a better chance of success if they target farmers who have better resource endowments and who are connected to better-functioning value chains rather than blanket technology scaling-up strategies targeting the majority of smallholders. Future agricultural research needs to shift the focus from predominantly developing new biophysical technologies towards social science research that assesses issues at value chain, macroeconomic institutions and policies that influence adoption of technology...|$|R
40|$|Historical papers {{vary widely}} in their {{apparent}} stability. Knowledge of elemental concentrations can sometimes {{explain why some}} papers are found in browned and brittle condition and others are not. High concentrations of K, Al and S in such papers, for instance, are likely associated with alum; an acidic compound. Papers still durable and light in color may contain high levels of Ca; likely in association with calcium carbonate or other compounds known {{to act as an}} alkaline reserve in paper, helping them maintain an alkaline pH over time. Determination of these elemental concentrations in artifacts on paper can help the preservation specialist make more informed decisions about the efficacy of various aqueous <b>intervention</b> treatments or <b>storage</b> protocol options. XRF is an especially effective non-destructive technique for elemental analysis where the density of elements of interest is high, as in the analysis of modern metals. XRF analysis of historical paper, however, is made difficult by its minimal thickness, lack of density, and usually low concentrations of key elements of interest; Al, K, S, Mg, Fe, Cu and Ca. Quantitative analysis is made more difficult by the wide variation in thickness and density of papers made in Europe between 1300 and 1800. A technique was developed to correct for the variation in paper thickness and density by placing a thin film impregnated with Cr and Br behind the paper specimen. Variations in Cr and Br signal strength and backscatter in a selected region of the spectrum allowed us to generate a ‘thickness/density’ value that became part of the final calibration. A special acrylic accessory was constructed and mounted to a Bruker TRACeR III-V handheld instrument to position the Cr/Br thin film in the same location behind paper specimens during calibration and analysis of unknowns. 40 historical paper specimens were used in the calibration set; 36 to establish the calibration, and 4 to validate the accuracy of the final calibration. Samples from 10 spots were taken from each specimen and combined into one sample for destructive inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis [...] The ICP-OES data for each specimen therefore represent an average result for the 10 spots. XRF analyses near each of the 10 spots used for the ICP-OES sampling were collected and then summed before being used in the calibration. We assume this summed scan corresponds to the average result obtained through ICP-OES. Using this technique, our calibration allows us to estimate ppm concentrations of K, S, Ca, and Fe with a precision of +/- 20 % at a 90 % confidence level when concentrations are close to 1000 ppm. Precision improves at higher concentrations, and is poorer at lower concentrations. Compositional variation must also be considered. For instance, precision is generally better with Ca, due to its high concentration. Fe was present in the calibration specimens in a narrower range making the accuracy outside of this range poorer. The precision for S is not as good as for K due to decreased instrument sensitivity for lighter elements. However, we believe this level of precision is adequate for documenting trends in the concentrations of alum (potassium aluminum sulfate or aluminum sulfate), Ca compounds, and Fe in hundreds of specimens over the centuries, or for documenting the average concentrations in large collections or collection subsets. Our parameters for precision result from a review of repeated measurements made on 4 samples held back from the calibration. The precision reported with the results is the propagated variance and agrees with the direct measurements. The accuracy of the results on the 4 samples not used in the calibration, for which we had ICP-OES results, showed variations distributed fairly evenly above and below the ICP-OES values indicating that the accuracy was much better than the precision. We are currently evaluating results from a new experiment designed to determine if this technique can be used to monitor changes in single artifacts during aqueous treatment. The precision may improve over what we obtained when analyzing widely differing unknowns because single artifacts provide the same or a very similar paper thickness/density from analysis to analysis. In the meantime, we believe the method is useful at its present level of development for collections surveys. Again, such data can provide valuable information to preservation specialists who make collections care and treatment decisions...|$|R
40|$|The global {{epidemic}} of obesity is rapidly becoming {{a major public}} health problem {{in many parts of}} the world. Unhealthy diets and physical inactivity are two modifiable risk factors for prevention of obesity and its associated chronic diseases. Their influence on muscle energy metabolism and fat mass is not completely elucidated. A decreased capacity for fatty acid oxidation (FAO) may be a metabolic risk factor for weight gain and is found to be depressed in obese individuals; and exercise training may promote an increased capacity for FAO. In addition to the interest in whole-body FAO, the role of site specific lipid accumulation including visceral adipose tissue (VAT), intrahepatic lipids (IHL) and intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) has become a focus of interest because of their reported association with insulin resistance (IR), a key metabolic defect associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). However, ambiguity persists regarding the importance of IMCL as a metabolic substrate for energy production in obesity. A better understanding of the factors regulating FAO, body fat distribution and IMCL mobilisation is important for the development of interventions allowing effective treatment of conditions in which these are disturbed. The study of individuals with metabolic myopathies can give more information about the energy metabolism of muscle. McArdle disease (MD) affects glucose availability to muscle for energy production. Investigations into IMCL storage and mobilisation in MD have not been reported. The aims of this thesis are to investigate 1) the effects of weight-loss via dietary restriction plus modest but clinically-relevant exercise training on FAO, body fat distribution and mobilisation of IMCL during exercise in obese non-diabetic adults; 2) the effect of an exercise training <b>intervention</b> on IMCL <b>storage</b> and mobilisation in a subject with MD. All obese subjects underwent a 4 month lifestyle intervention with weekly meetings with a dietitian and an exercise physiologist. Of the 92 subjects, 73 completed the intervention. They showed significant decreases in body weight (8 %), fat mass (14 %) and total cholesterol (5 %). The exercise prescription of 1500 kcal. week- 1 resulted in variable compliance with the prescription (1224 ± 1085 kcal. week- 1) measured by heart rate monitor. Those who did most exercise and also those who had less weekly variability in their exercise, had greater reductions in body weight and fat mass. The total activity energy expenditure measured by accelerometry did not change post-intervention but there was a reduction in low intensity activity and an increase in moderate and high intensity activity. A submaximal treadmill test and resting metabolic rate (RMR) using indirect calorimetry was measured before and after the intervention to investigate factors regulating FAO and energy expenditure. Subjects showed increases in FAO without change in energy expenditure for the same walking speed post intervention, but the volume of exercise completed during the intervention was not associated with these changes. To investigate body fat distribution in obesity, VAT, IHL and soleus muscle IMCL was measured in a sub-group of 18 males by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) along with measurement of maximal aerobic capacity. Fitness increased significantly with significant decreases in VAT (29 %) and IHL (54 %), without significant change in IMCL. Subjects who had the greatest decrease in VAT were those who exercised for longer durations during the intervention. IHL was the only measure of excess lipid that correlated with IR. The measurement of IMCL before and after 1 -hour of cycle ergometer exercise showed no significant mobilisation of IMCL either at baseline or after the lifestyle intervention. The intensity of the acute exercise was adjusted to correspond to each individual’s maximal fatty acid oxidation (MFAO) which increased by over 60 % post intervention. In the subject with MD, an 8 week exercise training intervention without dietary intervention increased IMCL stores by 27 %, but there was no marked change in IMCL with acute exercise at both time points. The findings of this thesis demonstrate that a clinically relevant and achievable lifestyle intervention incorporating weight loss through diet and objectively measured exercise can achieve improvements in blood lipid profile, body composition and FAO. The differential effects of the intervention on the various fat depots and their associations to metabolic markers suggest that individualised strategies may be required dependent upon body fat distribution. The non detection of mobilisation of IMCL by MRS suggests that these lipids may not be present as a substrate source in this population but rather an ectopic lipid depot related to increased energy consumption in diet. The relatively low capacity for FAO in both the obese and MD subjects may have affected the results. This thesis discusses implications for clinical practice, discusses novel findings related to the energy metabolism in obesity and MD and informs clinical and basic science about important future directions...|$|R
