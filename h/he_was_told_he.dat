Trautmann attended that evening's post-match banquet despite {{being unable to}} move his head, {{and went to bed}} expecting the injury to heal with rest. As the pain did not recede, the following day he went to St George's Hospital, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>he</b> merely had a crick in his neck which would go away. Three days later, he got a second opinion from a doctor at Manchester Royal Infirmary. An X-ray revealed he had dislocated five vertebrae, the second of which was cracked in two. The third vertebra had wedged against the second, preventing further damage which could have cost Trautmann his life.|$|E

5|$|Having not {{featured}} for Cardiff {{during the}} opening months of the 2010–11 season, Comminges joined League One side Carlisle United on a short-term loan deal until 31 December 2010. Carlisle manager Greg Abbott hinted {{at the possibility of}} a permanent deal, should the loan be a success. However, Comminges failed to make a league appearance during his three-month loan spell, playing just 45 minutes in a 3–2 win over Conference National side Tamworth in the FA Cup. The adverse weather conditions during his loan agreement had resulted in a spate of postponements, and Comminges returned to his parent club earlier than agreed. On returning to Cardiff, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>he</b> was free to find a new club with his contract expiring {{at the end of the}} season. He left the club by mutual consent, and subsequently joined League Two side Southend United on a free transfer in January 2011.|$|E
5|$|Beardsley {{signed for}} League One club Preston North End on a free {{transfer}} on 12 August 2012, linking up again with manager Graham Westley. He {{had spent the}} pre-season ahead of 2012–13 training with the club, although the transfer had been held up while the club waited for confirmation from the Football League in accordance with new financial fair play rules. Beardsley made his Preston debut in a 2–0 home win over Huddersfield Town in the League Cup on 14 August 2012, assisting the club's second goal of the match, with his low cross being scored by Nicky Wroe. He scored his first goal for Preston on 4 September 2012 after converting David Amoo's cross in the third-minute of their 1–1 away draw with Carlisle United in the Football League Trophy, a tie that Preston won 3–1 on penalties. Beardsley scored one further goal that month, heading in Jeffrey Monakana's cross on 64 minutes as Preston came from behind to beat Yeovil Town 3–2 at home. It proved to be Beardsley's last goal for five months, ending his goal drought in a 3–1 away loss to Yeovil on 12 February 2013, in what was Westley's last match {{in charge of the}} club. Beardsley made just two appearances under new manager Simon Grayson over the remainder of 2012–13, both all as a second-half substitute. Shortly after the season ended, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>he</b> could leave Preston if a suitable offer was received. He made 22 appearances during 2012–13, scoring 3 times, as Preston ranked in 14th-place in League One.|$|E

25|$|His second {{spell on}} Merseyside lasted {{two years before}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>he</b> could leave on a free transfer.

When <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>he</b> could not get on the Virgin flight, Tidswell told Fairfax Media he was shocked when he was told new terrorism laws meant he could not wear the shirt on the plane.

Édouard’s father, Gaspard, travelled by train to Winnipeg with the intention of bringing his body to Willow Bunch for burial. However, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>he</b> needed a double fare, he realized he did not have enough money to do so.

Spaniard Fernando Marqués also arrived for an undisclosed fee from Espanyol. Midfielders Sebastian Giovinco and Massimo Gobbi both signed for Parma at the start of August on a loan deal from Juventus and on a free transfer from Fiorentina respectively, as did Danilo Pereira from Benfica. Journeyman forward Cristiano Lucarelli signed on loan for Napoli after <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>he</b> was surplus to requirements at Parma, while experienced defender Christian Panucci retired at the age of thirty-seven.

However, Hewson retained his car despite attracting controversy courtesy of it. He entered Parliament {{at a time when there}} was a leadership vacuum on the conservative side of politics. The Coalition, led by John Howard, lost the 1987 election and a majority of Liberal MPs voted to keep him as leader over his predecessor Andrew Peacock. In September 1988, Howard appointed Hewson shadow finance minister. In May 1989, when Andrew Peacock replaced Howard as Leader, Hewson became shadow treasurer. Prior to Howard's dumping, when Peacock was the shadow treasurer, Hewson had been seen as the real shadow treasurer. In the lead up to the 1990 election, Hewson, the trained economist, performed well against the then-Treasurer Paul Keating. Hewson claimed in December 1989 that Keating was reluctant to debate with him on the economy.|$|E
