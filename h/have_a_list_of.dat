5|$|Because the Lithuanians did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> PMO members, {{they did}} not arrest the main leaders. Also, provincial PMO {{branches}} remained intact. Therefore, on September 17, 1919, new orders were issued scheduling the second coup attempt {{for the end of}} September. This attempt was also discovered. A Lithuanian woman succeeded in convincing Petras Vrubliauskas, PMO deputy commander in Vilnius, to transfer the PMO document archive to the Lithuanians. On September 21, the Lithuanians obtained a full list of PMO members and supporters and arrested them in the following days. The PMO branch in Lithuania ceased to function and was liquidated.|$|E

25|$|The {{layout of}} the ticket has changed with time. At first, tickets were {{identical}} on all local lines, and were small cardboard rectangles, often with a hole pierced in the middle. Tickets then became orange, with a white strip on one end for stamping information about the station and time of validation. The SKM then moved to light blue tickets, also with a white stripe which were only valid on its lines. Originally, this new layout had a list of stops printed on the reverse. Recently, this {{has been replaced by}} advertisements, or information about the possibility of advertising. There are also blank tickets, sold by train conductors to sell tickets at stops where no ticket office is available. These <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> stops with boxes to note start and destination of the journey, type of discount (if any) and number of tickets. An extra fee for sale on the train can also be noted on these tickets, for instance if a passenger boards at a stop where he could buy a ticket normally.|$|E

McCarthy claimed the list was provided to and dismissed by then-Secretary of State Dean Acheson, saying that the [...] "State Department harbors a nest of Communists and Communist sympathizers who are helping to shape our foreign policy". In 1953, McCarthy was reelected to a second term and the Republican Party regained control of the Senate; with the Republicans in the majority, McCarthy was made chairman of the Senate Committee on Government Operations. This committee included the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and the mandate of this subcommittee allowed McCarthy to use it to carry out his investigations of Communists in the government. McCarthy appointed 26-year-old Roy Cohn as chief counsel to the subcommittee and future Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy as assistant counsel; reassigning Francis Flanagan to the ad hoc position of general counsel.|$|E

Paulini had no songwriting credits on her debut album One Determined Heart (2004), and co-wrote only two tracks on her second album Superwoman (2006). In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, Paulini revealed that she felt manufactured with her first two albums, saying: [...] "You kind of actually feel trapped because when they would ask you to make an album, they'd <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> songs ready for you to choose from.

2500|$|Sometime in mid-July 1919, PMO {{forces in}} Vilnius began {{planning}} a coup {{to replace the}} Lithuanian government with a pro-Polish cabinet, which would agree to a union with Poland (the proposed MiÄ™dzymorze federation). Polish leader JÃ³zef PiÅ‚sudski believed there were enough Polish sympathizers in Lithuania {{to carry out the}} coup. On August 3, a Polish diplomatic mission, led by Leon Wasilewski, in Kaunas had a double purpose: propose a plebiscite in the contested territories and assess preparedness for the coup. On August 6, the Lithuanian government rejected the plebiscite proposal, stating that the disputed territories constitute ethnographic Lithuania. PMO planned to capture and hold Kaunas for a few hours until arrival of the regular Polish troops, situated only some [...] east from the city. The coup would be portrayed as an initiative of local population to [...] "free Lithuania from German influence" [...] while denouncing any involvement of the Polish government. Polish newspapers ran a propaganda campaign claiming that the Council of Lithuania was simply a German puppet. The coup was initially scheduled for the night of August 27 to 28, but was postponed to September 1. Lithuanian intelligence discovered the coup, but did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> PMO members. Lithuanian authorities began mass arrests of some 200 Polish activists, including some officers of the Lithuanian Army. Kaunas was declared under the state of siege. Polish press saw mass arrests of Polish activists [...] "to whom no charge can be ascribed other than being Poles" [...] as proof of systematic anti-Polish policies of the German-ridden Lithuanian government. PMO was little affected by the arrests and scheduled another coup attempt for the end of September. However, Lithuanians obtained a full PMO membership list and liquidated the organization in Lithuania.|$|E
