These helpers lived in the camp and at the sub-camp with the children.|$|E
5|$|The House of Rohan {{owned the}} palace until the French Revolution, {{when it was}} confiscated, {{declared}} bien national ("state owned"), and finally auctioned off on 8August 1791. Bought by the municipality, it became the new town hall (hôtel deville) the same year, succeeding the Neubau. Much of the furniture {{and many of the}} works of art in the Palais were sold, and in 1793 the eight life-sized mural portraits of prince-bishops <b>decorating</b> <b>the</b> Salle des évêques (Bishops' Hall) were destroyed. They were replaced in 1796 by allegories of civic virtues painted by Joseph Melling. Only the portrait of Armand Gaston, the builder of the palace, was later restored to its original place with a 1982 replica of Hyacinthe Rigaud's lost painting. Melling also replaced the overdoor portraits of kings of France, <b>decorating</b> <b>the</b> same room with paintings of vases.|$|E

5|$|This {{adornment}} in Indian Mound Cemetery {{has been}} called the first such public decoration of Confederate burials, but the claim is disputed by other towns in the Southern United States. Romney's decoration contributed to a precedent that spread throughout the South during the Reconstruction Era.

5000|$|Homecoming Week {{activities}} include daily dress-up days such as [...] "Kid Day" [...] (usually on Tuesday) and [...] "Maroon and Gold Day" [...] (every Friday {{for the last}} 100 years.) On Wednesday of Homecoming Week, a massive bonfire takes place in Merritt Park in West Duluth during which the game of Red Rover is usually played between the upper and lowerclassmen and every cheer in the cheerleaders' book is started.

Freshmen <b>decorate</b> <b>the</b> hall near the cafeteria and sophomores <b>decorate</b> <b>the</b> other half of the hall, while juniors <b>decorate</b> <b>the</b> second floor. Until the fall of 2006, seniors traditionally <b>decorated</b> <b>the</b> auditorium, however after a renovation of the room in the 2006-2007 school year, seniors have since <b>decorated</b> <b>the</b> third floor hallway to ensure the auditorium's features remain preserved.|$|R

The festival of lights, Deepavali, is celebrated with the lighting of lamps in every house, <b>decorating</b> <b>the</b> floors with rangoli, and the lighting of firecrackers. The annual Rath Yatra procession on the Ashadh-sud-bij date of the Hindu calendar at the Jagannath Temple and the procession of Tajia during the Muslim holy month of Muharram are important events.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this did}} not apply to the Subura slums, which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever, he did leave a mark on the monumental {{topography}} of the centre and of the Campus Martius, with the Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central gnomon was an obelisk taken from Egypt. The relief sculptures <b>decorating</b> <b>the</b> Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus' triumphs in the Res Gestae. Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the praetorians, the Vestals, and the citizenry of Rome.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, Walter Law {{replaced}} the Briarcliff Manor railroad station {{and moved the}} original building to serve as Millwood's station.

Central Briarcliff West is a neighborhood which has a number of mansions built by 20th-century millionaires who stayed at the Briarcliff Lodge and later built estates in the area. The Seven Sisters, a 1915 production, was filmed at the Briarcliff Lodge.|$|E
5|$|Rathbone {{jumped from}} his seat and {{struggled}} with Booth, who dropped the pistol and drew a knife, then stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm. Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as Booth prepared to jump from the box to the stage, a twelve-foot drop; Booth's riding spur became entangled on the Treasury flag <b>decorating</b> <b>the</b> box, and he landed awkwardly on his left foot. As he began crossing the stage, many in the audience thought {{he was part of}} the play.|$|E
5|$|The house stands {{mostly as}} it did in 1861 save a few alterations. The front porch was {{screened}} in at the time the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places, the screens have since been removed. At {{the rear of the house}} a small porch was enclosed. In 1909 or 1910 there were major subtractions and replacements. Removed were a cast-iron widow's walk along the roof ridge and a large gable dormer, decorated in the same manner as the cornice <b>decorating</b> <b>the</b> roof trim. The present dormer replaced the larger one and is more of a low-shed type.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} other related unequivalent tilings, {{such as the}} hexagon-boat-star and MikullaRoth tilings. For instance, if the {{matching}} rules for the rhombus tiling are reduced to a specific restriction on the angles permitted at each vertex, a binary tiling is obtained. Its underlying symmetry is also fivefold {{but it is not}} a quasicrystal. It can be obtained either by <b>decorating</b> <b>the</b> rhombs of the original tiling with smaller ones, or by applying substitution rules, but not by de Bruijn's cut-and-project method.|$|E
5|$|Unpaired males find a {{suitable}} cavity {{and begin to}} build nests {{in order to attract}} single females, often <b>decorating</b> <b>the</b> nest with ornaments such as flowers and fresh green material, which the female later disassembles upon accepting him as a mate. The amount of green material is not important, as long as some is present, but the presence of herbs in the decorative material appears to be significant in attracting a mate. The scent of plants such as yarrow acts as an olfactory attractant to females.|$|E
5|$|A {{virtually}} unknown work by Gaudí is the Casa Clapés (1899–1900), at 125 Carrer Escorial, {{commissioned by the}} painter Aleix Clapés, who collaborated on occasion with Gaudí, such as in <b>decorating</b> <b>the</b> Palau Güell and the Casa Milà. It has a ground floor and three apartments, with stuccoed walls and cast-iron balconies. Due to its lack of decoration or original structural solutions its authorship was unknown until 1976, when the architect's signed plans by Gaudí were discovered. In 1900, he renovated the house of Dr. Pere Santaló, at 32 Carrer Nou de la Rambla, a work of equally low importance. Santaló {{was a friend of}} Gaudí's, whom he accompanied during his stay in Puigcerdà in 1911.It was he who recommended him to do manual work for his rheumatism.|$|E

5|$|According to David A. Norris, {{a scholar}} specializing in Serbian {{cultural}} history, conditions in 19th-century Serbia were unsuitable {{for the development}} of visual art. Materials were difficult to come by, studio and exhibition spaces were virtually non-existent, and there were no art patrons willing to financially support painters and purchase their finished works. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, Serbian visual artists dedicated themselves almost exclusively to <b>decorating</b> <b>the</b> walls of churches and producing icons and other religious objects. There were some painters of Serb heritage living outside Serbia, such as Uroš Knežević and Jovan Popović, who resided in the Austrian Empire.|$|E
5|$|Appliqué art, {{which is}} a stitching-based craft unlike embroidery, was pioneered by Hatta Maharana of Pipili. It is widely used in Puri, both for {{decoration}} of the deities and for sale. Maharana's family members are employed as darjis or tailors or sebaks by the Maharaja of Puri. They prepare articles for <b>decorating</b> <b>the</b> deities in the temple for various festivals and religious ceremonies. The appliqué works are brightly coloured and patterned fabric {{in the form of}} canopies, umbrellas, drapery, carry bags, flags, coverings of dummy horses and cows, and other household textiles; these are marketed in Puri. The cloth used is made in dark colours of red, black, yellow, green, blue and turquoise blue.|$|E
5|$|In 1907 Sir Walter Jenner of the Jenner baronets {{and son of}} {{the late}} Sir William Jenner, {{physician}} to Queen Victoria, bought Lytes Cary. At that time the Great Hall was {{being used as a}} cider store and the Great Parlour was full of farm equipment. Jenner's brother Leopold had just bought and started to restore Avebury Manor in Wiltshire, and Jenner was inspired by his brother's work there. He set about restoring Lytes Cary and <b>decorating</b> <b>the</b> interiors in period style, including fine 17th century and 18th century oak furniture, antique tapestries and fabrics modelled after medieval textiles. He had the west range rebuilt in a plain William and Mary style by the architect C.E. Ponting, but left the historic core of the house mostly untouched. It incorporates carvings believed to be from the demolished St Benet Gracechurch.|$|E
