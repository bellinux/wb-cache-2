In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and the fears of social change from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. In this period African Americans were leaving the South {{by the tens of}} thousands, to escape oppressive social conditions and find work in the North and Midwestern industrial cities, in what came to be called the Great Migration.|$|E

As a way to proclaim themselves as equals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market,</b> women started to dress more seriously at work. Popular clothes for women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market</b> include knee-length skirts, wide-legged slacks, a matching blazer, and a blouse of a different color. Kitten-heeled shoes were often worn. Formal shoes became more comfortable during this period in time, with manufacturers adding soles that were more flexible and supportive. The shoes with moderately spiked heels and relatively pointy toes from the very late 1970s remained a fashion trend.|$|E

All signs of goodwill towards the Indonesian Republic however did not mitigate anti-Dutch regulations by the Republican government and anti-Indo sentiments in general. Throughout the decade all Dutch language institutions for Indos continued to be eliminated. All schools, orphanages and retirement homes for Indos were closed by 1951.

25|$|The third great wave of {{domestic}} migration from Puerto Rico came after World War II. Nearly 40,000 Puerto Ricans settled in New York City in 1946, and 58,500 in 1952–53. Many soldiers who returned after World War II {{made use of}} the GI Bill and went to college. Puerto Rican women confronted economic exploitation, discrimination, racism, and the insecurities inherent in the migration process on a daily basis, however they fared better than did men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market.</b> The women left their homes for the factories in record numbers.

25|$|However, others {{attribute}} {{the decline of}} deaf clubs {{to the end of}} World WarII and a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market.</b> During WWII there was high demand for factory laborers and a promise of high pay. Many deaf Americans left their homes to move to bigger cities with the hope of obtaining a factory job. This huge influx of workers into new cities created the need for deaf clubs. When World WarII ended and the civil rights movement progressed, the federal government started offering more jobs to deaf men and women. People began switching from manufacturing jobs to service jobs, moving away from solitary work with set hours. Today, deaf clubs are rare, but deaf advocacy centers and other deaf organizations have become widespread and popular.|$|E
25|$|Pakistani women lack {{social value}} and status because of {{negation}} of {{their roles as}} producers and providers in all social roles. The preference for sons due to their productive role often dictates the allocation of household resources in their favor. Traditionally, male {{members of the family}} are given better education and are equipped with skills to compete for resources in the public arena, while female members are imparted domestic skills to be good mothers and wives. Lack of skills, limited opportunities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market,</b> and social, religious and cultural restrictions limit women’s chances to compete for resources in the public arena. This situation has led to the social and economic dependency of women that becomes the basis for male power over women in all social relationships.|$|E

25|$|Technical education, {{which is}} {{provided}} in three-year and five-year programs, includes schools in three different fields: industrial, commercial and agricultural. The UN and other multilateral organizations are working towards improving the technical and vocational training system in Egypt. It is recommended to the Ministry of Education to introduce broad vocational skills in the curricula of general secondary schools. In this way students {{will be able to}} gain certification in practical skills needed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market.</b> The Ministry of Education (MoE) controls pre-tertiary, school-based programs that can start after grade 6 and that enroll the largest number of students in TVET-over 2 million students. The Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) controls the middle technical institutes (MTIs). These draw their enrollments from MoE's general secondary schools or technical schools and have much smaller enrollment numbers. Graduates of the MoE's vocational programs can enter vocational training centers (VTCs). From the 2004 data, it is estimated that 30 percent of the secondary students have opted for the vocational track.|$|E
25|$|The University of Ottawa's co-op {{program may}} provide {{students}} {{with a wide range}} of benefits. In addition to relevant work experience students acquire from the provided work terms, other benefits may arise from choosing the co-operative education program. For example, students can begin to build a network of contacts throughout their co-op work terms. Furthermore, students learn more about resume building and develop strong techniques for successful interviews. This can lead to a student's increased ability to find a job more easily after graduation. Due to their work experience, students may hold a stronger advantage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market.</b> In addition, many students may struggle with paying for tuition fees, thus, the University of Ottawa's co-op program provides a solution by offering the opportunity for students to earn an income throughout their studies. The program's staff is composed of experienced and friendly specialists who are dedicated to help students reach their goals. It is with these benefits and many others tied into the program for which numerous students choose to participate in co-operative education programs such as the ones offered at the University of Ottawa.|$|E
500|$|In April 2012, the Boston Herald {{sparked a}} {{campaign}} controversy when it reported that from 1986 to 1995 Warren had listed {{herself as a}} minority in the Association of American Law Schools (AALS) directories, called the AALS Directory of Law Teachers. Harvard Law School had publicized her minority status in response to criticisms about a lack of faculty diversity, but Warren {{said that she was}} unaware of this until she read about it in a newspaper during the 2012 election. Scott Brown, her Republican opponent in the Senate race, speculated that she had fabricated Native American heritage to gain advantage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market.</b> Former colleagues and supervisors at universities where she had worked stated that Warren's ancestry played no role in her hiring. [...] Warren responded to the allegations, saying that she had self-identified as a minority in the directories in order to meet others with similar tribal roots. Her brothers defended her, stating that they [...] "grew up listening to our mother and grandmother and other relatives talk about our family's Cherokee and Delaware heritage". In her 2014 autobiography, Warren described the allegations as untrue and hurtful. The New England Historic Genealogical Society found a family newsletter that alluded to a marriage license application that listed Elizabeth Warren’s great-great-great grandmother as part Cherokee, but could not find the primary document and found no proof of her descent. The Oklahoma Historical Society said that finding a definitive answer about Native American heritage can be difficult because of intermarriage and deliberate avoidance of registration.|$|E

[...] Dutch has not been repressed by the influx of English, as only 3% of the English-speakers in Brussels are native speakers. [...] English as a worldwide lingua franca fulfills an increasingly {{important role in the}} economic and cultural sphere, and in this sense poses more of a threat to the position of French than Dutch. [...] Now, most of those who speak Dutch, even as a second language, are usually trilingual.

2500|$|In February 2011, the Labour MP for Nottingham East, Chris Leslie, {{sponsored}} a private member's bill in Parliament, the master's degrees (Minimum Standards) Bill 2010–12, to [...] "prohibit universities awarding Master's degrees unless certain standards {{of study and}} assessment are met". The Bill's supporters described the practice as a [...] "historical anachronism" [...] and argued that unearned qualifications should be discontinued to preserve the academic integrity of the taught MA. Further, they warned that the title gave Oxbridge graduates an unfair advantage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market.</b> The Bill's opponents disputed that the title provided an unfair advantage in practice, noted that the QAA had previously investigated the matter and was unconcerned, and questioned whether it was desirable for Parliament to interfere in the academic procedures of autonomous universities, especially {{when there was no}} suggestion that analogous practices at Scottish universities be similarly reformed. The Bill received its second reading on 21 October 2011, during which many of these points were raised, but subsequently failed to complete its passage through Parliament {{before the end of the}} session and thus made no further progress.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{expectations}} placed on women {{by their own}} religions, society also holds certain biases against women of certain religions that causes them to have less success <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market.</b> [...] This is seen most often among Muslim women who express their religion by [...] wearing modest clothing and traditional female Muslim accessories such as henna and hijabs. This was proven by {{a study by the}} Bristol school of Sociology that showed that Muslim women were 70 percent more likely to be unsuccessful in looking for work than Christian and nonreligious women. [...] These numbers stem from discriminatory actions on various levels of society that often lead Muslim women to lose their jobs or have trouble finding jobs. For example, on the local level, a woman was fired from a Jiffy Lube for wearing her hijab to work because it apparently violated the company's [...] "no hat" [...] rule. The company suffered no repercussions for this action. [...] On the federal level, the court case Webb v Philadelphia ruled that an officer wearing her hijab with her uniform, which is a requirement for women in her religion, was in violation of the states' standard of neutrality and therefore could be terminated for her choice to wear it. This ruling makes this type of discrimination precedent for similar situations and makes it harder to traditional Muslim women to find and hold professional careers. There are laws against this type of discrimination, such as America's Title XII of their Civil Right's Act of 1964 which makes it illegal for businesses to discriminate against their employees [...] based on their sex, race, color, national origin, and religion, but even so this sort of religious and gender discrimination often intersect and lead to the feminization of poverty within certain communities.|$|E

At a speech she gave at <b>the</b> Y.W.C.A. <b>in</b> Detroit on April 23, 1934, Bell discussed the many valuable identities of the non-working woman.

2500|$|Prestige {{of colleges}} {{correlates}} with age, {{such that the}} oldest east-coast schools tend to have accumulated the most prestige {{by virtue of their}} longevity. There is widespread consensus that the fit between a student and a school is an important factor. Several reports suggest that [...] "fit should trump prestige every single time," [...] and that it is better for a school to match a student in terms of social, cultural, and academic qualities and not be chosen simply because of a school's prestige. Others see college admissions as essentially a choice between [...] "price and prestige". Elite colleges have been compared to designer labels, a valuable credential <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>market,</b> and an entryway into top graduate schools. Some advisors specialize in helping students find a good fit—a suitable list of colleges—which helps students in the long run. They help students to explore their values and needs, and provide counseling to help both students and parents find a college or university program that helps students meet long-term goals. Questions include thinking about life goals, which activities a person likes best, and what style of learning works best for the student. Evaluating personal preferences is important and can take time. One advisor suggests it is important for a student to think through what is best, and choose on this basis, and [...] "do not listen to your friends" [...] since they have different needs and wants. [...] "One of the worst ways {{to make a decision about}} where to go to college is to follow a friend because he or she is having a good time at that school," [...] wrote one advisor.
