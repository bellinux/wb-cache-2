5|$|In 1876, Wallace {{needed a}} £500 advance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> of The Geographical Distribution of Animals {{to avoid having}} to sell some of his {{personal}} property. Darwin was very aware of Wallace's financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get Wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science. When the £200 annual pension was awarded in 1881, it helped to stabilise Wallace's financial position by supplementing the income from his writings.|$|E

5|$|Eureka was {{published}} in a small hardcover edition in March 1848 by Wiley & Putnam priced at 75 cents. Poe persuaded George Palmer Putnam, who had previously taken a chance on Poe by printing his only novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket in England, to publish Eureka after claiming this work {{was more important than}} Isaac Newton's discovery of gravity. Putnam paid Poe fourteen dollars for the work. Poe suggested an initial printing of at least one million copies; Putnam settled on 750, of which 500 were sold that year. Other accounts say that Poe requested 50,000 copies, and 500 were printed. Poe was given in advance the full payment of $14 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>publisher.</b>|$|E
5|$|In August 1992, Antex Publishing of Lexington {{released}} Farmer's autobiography entitled Richie. In {{addition to}} the standard printing, the publisher offered {{a special edition of}} the book in which direct quotes from Farmer were rendered in blue type, similar to the words of Jesus in red letter editions of the Bible. Long-time Wildcats radio broadcaster Cawood Ledford wrote the book's foreword. By the end of October, the book had sold 30,000 copies, and a second printing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> was ordered. Farmer participated in several book signings across the state, as well as filming television advertisements for local products and conducting speaking engagements for dental insurance provider Delta Dental to promote good oral health in his native eastern Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|In England, Legal Deposit can {{be traced}} back to at least 1610. The Copyright Act 1911 {{established}} the principle of the legal deposit, ensuring that the British Library and five other libraries in Great Britain and Ireland are entitled to receive a free copy of every item published or distributed in Britain. The other five libraries are: the Bodleian Library at Oxford; the University Library at Cambridge; the Trinity College Library at Dublin; and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales. The British Library is the only one that must automatically receive a copy of every item published in Britain; the others are entitled to these items, but must specifically request them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> after learning that they have been or are about to be published, a task done centrally by the Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries.|$|E

5|$|Thompson {{returned}} {{to file a}} lawsuit in Tennessee state court in October 2003 {{on behalf of the}} victims of two teenage stepbrothers who had pleaded guilty to reckless homicide, endangerment, and assault. Since the boys told investigators they were inspired by Grand Theft Auto III, Thompson sought $246 million in damages <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>publisher,</b> Take-Two Interactive, along with PlayStation 2 maker Sony Computer Entertainment America and retailer Wal-Mart. The suit charged that the defendants knew or should have known that the game would cause copycat violence. On October 22, 2003, the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. Two days later, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal, and the case was closed.|$|E
5|$|When his {{apprenticeship}} {{ended in}} 1847, Evans, then 21, refused {{an offer of}} employment from Landells, deciding instead to go into business for himself as a wood-engraver and colour printer. In 1848 Evans engraved a title-page illustration, among other commissions, for the Illustrated London News. However, the Illustrated London News stopped employing him {{on the basis that}} his wood engraving was too fine for newspaper work. His final print for the Illustrated London News showed the four seasons, and was illustrated by Foster. In fact Foster received his first commission <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> Ingram, Cook, and Company to reproduce the four scenes in oil. In 1851, Ingram chose Evans to engrave three prints for Ida Pfeiffer's Travels in the Holy Land. He used three blocks for the work: the key-block, outlining the illustration, was printed in a dark-brown hue; the other two were in a buff colour and a grayish-blue colour. For the same firm, Evans completed an order for a book-cover using bright reds and blues on white paper. That year he received the first commission to print a book, written by Fanny Fern and illustrated by Foster. Evans had enough business to apprentice his two younger brothers, Wilfred and Herbert, and to buy a hand-press. Soon he moved his premises to Racquet Court, and bought three more hand-presses.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} death of Voltaire in 1778, Beaumarchais set out to publish Voltaire's {{complete}} works, many of which were banned in France. He bought the rights to most of Voltaire's many manuscripts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> Charles-Joseph Panckouck in February 1779. To evade French censorship, he set up printing presses in Kehl, Germany. He bought the complete foundry of the famous English type designer John Baskerville from his widow and also purchased three paper mills. Seventy volumes were published between 1783 and 1790. While the venture proved a financial failure, Beaumarchais was instrumental in preserving many of Voltaire's later works which otherwise might have been lost.|$|E

However, Warner Music Group and MTV Games stated that the lack of songs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>publisher</b> was due to current negotiations over new licensing costs.
