Indeed the constructed paths can have an <b>interference</b> <b>zone,</b> mainly a shared carrier sense range.

The first one (D 1) {{is characterized by}} north-striking foliations that are gently dipping {{to the west and}} carry W- to WSW-plunging lineations, whereas the second one (D 2) is characterized by steeper foliations that are striking to the NNE and lineations that are either subhorizontal or gently plunging to the SSW. The younger pattern is related to late-Panafrican tectonics along the major Angavo shear zone that is about 1000 km in length and 40 km in width with apparently little offset. Deformation in the Angavo zone induced interference folding on both sides. The D 2 event is characterized by low pressures (ca 400 MPa) and high temperatures (up to 790 degrees C) responsible for prograde granulite facies conditions, that resulted from heat transfer due to magma and fluid advection in the Angavo shear zone. The D 2 event is pinned at 550 +/- 11 Ma by a new monazite age from a reoriented Andringitrean granite near Ankaramena. A new suite of amphibole and biotite Ar-Ar geochronological data enables to retrace the thermochronogical evolution inside and outside the Angavo shear zone. Combined with new structural results from the western <b>interference</b> <b>zone.</b> these ages yield {{a better understanding of the}} late-Panafrican history of central Madagascar. No diachronism is observed along the strike of the Angavo shear zone. Conversely, amphibole and especially biotite ages decrease from West to East, i. e. towards the shear zone.

Spintronics aims at using not only the electron's electric charge but also its quantum mechanical spin in order to develop novel device concepts beyond conventional charge-based electronics. Currently tremendous efforts are underway world-wide to achieve this goal and the theoretical research proposed here is part of it. In particular, the conditions are analyzed under which a device of nanometer size can deliver a beam of spin-oriented electrons using the spin-dependent reflection at a barrier. This work starts out from the fact that electrons can have two spin orientations, up and down. When the electrons in a tiny layer of a semiconductor like InSb hit a barrier, spin-up and spin-down electrons are reflected into different directions so that an appropriate set-up can select one or the other reflected beam. We study the conditions under which this set-up can be used to create a spin-polarized electron beam from a beam of initially unpolarized electrons.

However, the tip of the equatorial fountain at the geomagnetic equator constitutes a significant amount of plasma at a topside-equivalent altitude.

The current experiments test why OSM and crowding interact in this way. In three experiments, target-flanker distance is manipulated whilst also varying mask duration in a digit identification task.
