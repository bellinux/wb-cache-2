5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave off}} the Bahamas organized into Tropical Depression Six {{on the afternoon}} of July 21. The depression became the sixth named storm of the season only two hours later, the first time the sixth storm of the season had ever formed that early in the season. The storm headed northward from the Bahamas, then northeast over the Atlantic, becoming disorganized by July 24 under the effects of shear and drier air. It moved erratically, <b>inching</b> closer to Bermuda while barely remaining a tropical storm. Bermuda received some strong wind gusts, but was otherwise unaffected. Tropical Storm Franklin then accelerated north and northeast, roughly paralleling the East Coast of the United States, and intensified to near hurricane strength. Eventually, Franklin became extratropical along the coast of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1942, Lindwall helped the St. George Dragons rugby league team to reach the grand final for the second {{consecutive}} year and also finished the season as the League's top point-scorer. Lindwall and his brother Jack, who played on the wing, scored all of the team's points in the grand final, Jack scoring a try and Ray kicking three goals. However they were denied by a last-minute penalty goal and St. George were defeated by Canterbury-Bankstown 11–9. All the while, the Japanese were <b>inching</b> ever closer to Australia. Malaya had fallen and the northern Australian city of Darwin had been the subject of Japanese air raids.|$|E
5|$|One {{week after}} Super Millionaire {{came to an}} end, Ken Jennings of Salt Lake City, Utah, became the new {{champion}} on Jeopardy! The episode, broadcast on June 2, 2004, {{was the first in}} a long winning streak for the software engineer, made possible due to a change at the beginning of that season (the show's twentieth on air in syndication), eliminating the longstanding rule limiting consecutive appearances for a champion to five. With no limit to his appearances, Jennings began to break many game show records. As his streak continued deeper into the 21st season, Jennings was <b>inching</b> closer and closer to Olmstead's record. Jennings topped Olmstead's Millionaire winnings with his 65th consecutive win, finishing the day with $45,099 and a new cumulative total of $2,197,000.|$|E

Occasional boundaries (mainly from Sharma) and early singles off every over had India slowly, but surely <b>inching</b> towards their target. In what seemed like forever, India crawled from 124/8 to 170, 180 and 190/8. Finally Ishant got out to a Ben Hilfenhaus lbw decision that replays showed was going down the leg side, with the score at 205. Pragyan Ojha, the last man for India joined Laxman at the crease. During Mitchell Johnson's over more drama followed with Ojha being clearly struck in line, but On-field Umpire Billy Bowden turned down the appeal. Pragyan Ojha tried to sneak a single when substitute fielder Steven Smith shied at the stumps. But unfortunately for Australia, no fielders where backing his throw. It went for four overthrows meaning India just needed 2 runs to win.|$|E

50|$|ANSI B94.11M-1979 sets size {{standards}} for jobber-length straight-shank twist drill bits from 1/64 <b>inch</b> through 1 <b>inch</b> in 1/64 <b>inch</b> increments. For Morse taper-shank drill bits, the standard continues in 1/64 <b>inch</b> increments up to 1¾ <b>inch,</b> then 1/32 <b>inch</b> increments up to 2¼ <b>inch,</b> 1/16 <b>inch</b> increments up to 3 <b>inches,</b> 1/8 <b>inch</b> increments up to 3¼ <b>inches,</b> {{and a single}} 1/4 <b>inch</b> increment to 3½ <b>inches.</b> One aspect of this method of sizing is that the size increment between drill bits becomes larger as bit sizes get smaller sizes: 100% for the step from 1/64th to 1/32nd, but a much smaller percentage between 1 47/64th and 1 3/4.|$|R
2500|$|The demonstrators had {{different}} motives, including {{the suspicion that}} Erdoğan, who {{is thought to be}} attached to political Islam, will alter the secular state. Erdoğan's government denies having an Islamic agenda, but according to CNN, some critics argue that the government is <b>inching</b> the country towards increased religious rule. Erdoğan has had run-ins with the law in the past: He was tried and convicted for [...] "inciting religious hatred" [...] and had consequently served a four-month jail term in 2000 while he was the Mayor of Istanbul, Turkey's most populous city. According to the Guardian Unlimited, the pro-Islamic prime minister's party has been eroding secularists' longtime grip on power.|$|E
2500|$|In 1948, a Supreme Court {{ruling in}} a federal {{antitrust}} suit against the leading Hollywood studios, the so-called Big Five, outlawed block booking {{and led to the}} divestiture of the majors' theater chains over the next few years. After barely <b>inching</b> forward in the 1930s, the average U.S. feature production cost had essentially doubled through the 1940s, reaching an average $1million {{by the turn of the}} decade (the increase from 1940 to 1950 was 150percent in simple terms, 93percent after adjusting for inflation). With audiences draining away to television and other economic pressures forcing the studios to scale back production schedules, the [...] began disappearing from American theaters.|$|E
2500|$|Unbeknownst {{to anyone}} in the Confederate army, McPherson's men of the XVII Corps were lurking near Utica, Mississippi, {{maintaining}} strict drum and bugle silence and a strong cavalry screen. The two divisions had been <b>inching</b> along the parched ridge road between Utica and Raymond for two days, struggling to maintain proximity to a water source, while the remainder of Grant's army probed north towards the railroad. Having uncovered Pemberton's main body, Grant ordered McPherson to move his two divisions [...] into Raymond by mid-day May 12. Rising before daylight, Federal cavalry screening General John Logan's Third Division triggered the alarm from the state cavalry posted on the Utica road almost immediately.|$|E
