30|$|Retrospective and {{prospective}} studies provide conflicting results regarding scalp <b>infiltration</b> with local <b>anaesthesia,</b> such as diverse changes of perioperative haemodynamics, VAS scores, and morphine consumption. Pre-incision scalp infiltration was studied by Biswas and Bithal (2003): {{they concluded that}} the scalp infiltration may delay the requirement of the first analgesic dose. They assumed that in the bupivacaine group, the duration of skin hypoesthesia produced by 0.25  % bupivacaine (Swerdlow and Jones 1970) was longer than the duration of surgery time, which contributed to the apparently delayed requirement of the first analgesic dose. In our study, the time to first rescue analgesic requirement was prolonged in group R compared with group C. However, we found that despite the similarity of postoperative VAS scores in groups R and C, morphine consumption during the first 24 postoperative hours was significantly higher in group C than in group R.

40|$|Management of pain {{plays an}} {{important}} role during prostate biopsy. Various types of management of pain {{plays an important}} role during prostate biopsy. Various types of anaesthetic methods have been used. The present study aimed to compare the efficacy and complication rate between periprostatic lidocaine infiltration and transrectal lidocaine gel in transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. All prostate biopsy patients were included except those with lidocaine, allergy, haemorrhagic diathesis, anticoagulation therapy, the inability to rate a visual analogue scale and inability to obtain consent. They were randomized into two groups. Group 1 received 20 ml 2 % transrectal lidocaine gel. Group 2 received 5 ml 1 % lidocaine infiltration for each periprostatic nerve block with 23 -gauge spinal needle. After three minutes, prostate biopsy was performed with an 18 gauge 7 -inch spring-loaded biopsy gun. Six biopsies were taken for each lobe. Pain during probe insertion, biopsy and immediately after the procedure was assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale. Any complication immediately after procedure, one day or after one week, was recorded. Mean pain score was lower after periprostatic lidocaine infiltration compared to transrectal lidocaine gel (3. 1 + 1. 9 versus 4. 9 + 2. 4, p = 0. 027). There was no statistically significant difference in the complication rate.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to criticize the {{selectivity}} of intrasynovial injections into the distal interphalangeal joint, the navicular bursa, the digital flexor tendon sheath, the fetlock joint, the carpal synovial sheath as well as the joints of the carpus and tarsus. Therefore different synovial institutions of 57 fresh limbs of horses were alternately filled with 0. 15 % Disulfinblau solution, the legs were placed in a freezer at minus 21 °C and afterwards transversial saw cuts were made. Subsequently an anatomical evaluation of the spread of the injected substance in the saw cuts was undertaken and documented photographically. Disulfinblau and local anaesthetics were assumpted to have an analogical pattern of distribution, both substances were placed on a par and therefore possible anesthetized regions would show a blue colouration. As results of this study after the singular intrasynovial injections certain blue- coloured regions have occurred. They originate from communication relationships and from direct infiltration, including an unilateral or both side colouration of the big nerve trunks. Especially in terms of possible perineural <b>infiltration</b> an <b>anaesthesia</b> of the distal interphalangeal joint seems to be able to additional desensibilize the navicular bursa, the navicular bone and its suspensory ligaments, the distal phalanx, distal parts of the deep digital flexor tendon and parts of the corium of the wall and sole. Similar regions would be achieved with an anaesthesia of the navicular bursa. The injection of the digital flexor tendon sheath is even able to reach a much bigger field by anaesthesia of the palmar or plantar nerves. As a consequence it should be considered, that diagnostic anaesthesias of all synovial structures in the region of the digit are too uncertain for exact localization of the navicular syndrome. Because of its ligamentous apparatus the fetlock joint is up to occasional exceptions resistant to diffusion and its anaesthesia seems to be relative selective. Yet the proximal sesamoideal bones were not anesthetized for sure. Whereas the injection of the radiocarpal joint hardly could lead to a spread of the local anaesthetic on the nerve branches of the median or ulnar nerve, the injection of the carpal synovial sheath can possibly act as a perineural infiltration. This would exceed the effects of a high palmar nerve block anesthesia. An anaesthesia of the intercarpal joints is assumpted to include the origin of the suspensory ligament and the accessory ligament. This seems to be based on a partial direct infiltration and/or a possible block of the palmar metacarpal nerves. Similar results should be expected for the plantar metatarsal nerves after injection of the distal tarsal joints. If this is the case it has to be considered for therapeutical purposes, that an intrasynovial medication is on no account sure to completely affect this region. Furthermore diagnostic anaesthesias of the tarsus are able to reach the N. fibularis profundus, which is followed by a block of the dorsal metatarsal nerves. While using diagnostic intrasynovial anaesthesia at least a certain degree of scepticism relating to their selectivity should be kept in the back of the practitioners mind. However they are despite sometimes confusing results an indispensable part of the lameness examination and in most cases and if correct interpretated an inestimable support...|$|R

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Local {{anaesthesia}} {{is commonly}} used in paediatric oral healthcare. <b>Infiltration</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> is the most frequently used, but recent developments in anaesthesia techniques have introduced an alternative: intraosseous anaesthesia. We propose to perform a split-mouth and parallel-arm multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing the pain caused by the insertion of the needle for the injection of conventional <b>infiltration</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> and intraosseous anaesthesia by the computerised QuickSleeper system, in children and adolescents. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Inclusion criteria are patients 7 - 15  years old with at least 2 first permanent molars belonging to the same dental arch (for the split-mouth RCT) or with a first permanent molar (for the parallel-arm RCT) requiring conservative or endodontic treatment limited to pulpotomy. The setting {{of this study is}} the Department of Paediatric Dentistry at 3 University dental hospitals in France. The primary outcome measure will be pain reported by the patient on a visual analogue scale concerning the insertion of the needle and the injection/infiltration. Secondary outcomes are latency, need for additional anaesthesia during the treatment and pain felt during the treatment. We will use a computer-generated permuted-block randomisation sequence for allocation to anaesthesia groups. The random sequences will be stratified by centre (and by dental arch for the parallel-arm RCT). Only participants will be blinded to group assignment. Data will be analysed by the intent-to-treat principle. In all, 160 patients will be included (30 in the split-mouth RCT, 130 in the parallel-arm RCT). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been approved by the French ethics committee for the protection of people (Comité de Protection des Personnes, Ile de France I) and will be conducted in full accordance with accepted ethical principles. Findings will be reported in scientific publications and at research conferences, and in project summary papers for participants...|$|E
40|$|Objective. With this review, {{we provide}} a {{comprehensive}} {{overview of the}} main aspects and currently used drugs for analgesia in shockwave lithotripsy. Evidence Acquisition. We reviewed current literature, concentrating on newer articles and high-quality reviews in international journals. Results. No standardized protocols for pain control in SWL exist, although it is crucial for treatment outcome. General and spinal anaesthesia show excellent pain control but are only recommended for selected cases. The newer opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are able to deliver good analgesia. Interest in inhalation anaesthesia with nitrous oxide, local anaesthesia with deep infiltration of the tissue, and dermal anaesthesia with EMLA or DMSO has recently rekindled, showing good results in terms of pain control and a favourable side effect profile.

40|$|Abstract Background Utilization {{of herbal}} {{medicines}} in the preoperative period by Nigerian patients booked for day case surgery {{has not been}} explored. Methods Cross-sectional survey of 60 patients presenting for day-case surgery at a tertiary healthcare institution over a 3 -week period in August 2011 was conducted. Using a structured questionnaire, inquiries were made concerning use of herbal medicines in the immediate preoperative period. Socio-demographic characteristics, information on use of concurrent medical prescriptions, types of herbs used, reasons for use, perceived side effects and perceived efficacy were obtained. Data were evaluated using descriptive statistics and Chi-square. Results Fifty-two (86. 7 %) were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 1 while 8 (13 %) were ASA 2. Most patients (86. 7 %) had their procedures done under local <b>infiltration</b> with monitored <b>anaesthesia</b> care (MAC), while 5. 0 % and 8. 3 % had their procedures done under regional and general anaesthesia, respectively. About 48. 3 % of respondents were on concurrent medical prescriptions while 51. 7 % were not. Forty percent (40 %) of patients admitted to use of herbal medicine, all by the oral route, in the immediate perioperative period; 87. 5 % did not inform their doctor of their herbal use. Types of herbs used included ‘dogonyaro’, ‘agbo’, ‘nchanwu’, and Tahitian noni. Treatment of malaria was commonest reason for use in 29. 2 % of patients, while cough and concurrent surgical condition were reasons given by 12. 5 % of patients, respectively. Seventy-nine percent (79. 2 %) of patients considered their herbal medications effective. Perceived side effects of herbal medication (16. 6 %) included fever, waist pain and intoxication. There were no variations in use between ASA 1 and ASA 2 patients and none between respondents on conventional medication against those that were not. Variables such as age less than 35 years, female gender, being married and being an urban dweller did not show any significant difference in use. Conclusion This survey revealed many patients were on one or more herbal preparations in the immediate preoperative period. In consideration of possible untoward drug interactions between conventional medication, herbal preparations and anaesthesia, doctors (especially anaesthetists) should routinely assess all patients booked to be anaesthetized, especially those for day case surgery. The authors recommend surveys with larger respondent numbers to determine prevalence of use and possible interactions between indigenous Nigerian herbs and anaesthesia. </p...|$|R

All animals were under local <b>infiltration</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> A five-cm length of jejunum was resected from {{the first part of the}} jejunum and end to end anastomosis using 3 - 0 Polygalactin- 910 with one row of sero-submoucosal interrupted sutures (SSIS) group, and one row of horizontal mattress interrupted sutures (HMIS) group. Two animals from each group were euthanized on the 4 th, 14 th and 21 st postoperative days. A 7 -cm segment of jejunum including the anastomosed area was resected from each animal. There was no significant adhesion between anastomosis area and surrounded tissues observed in SSIS animals, while there was significant adhesion between anastomosis area and surrounded tissues which were observed in HMIS animals. Stenosis degree was lower in the SSIS than the HMIS group. The bursting pressure was higher in the SSIS than the HMIS group. Macroscopic evaluation indicated that the anastomotic line mucosa was abridged better with less local edema in the SSIS group. Histological evaluation in the SSIS group showed almost all parameters such as epithelial recovery and repair of submucosal-mucosal layer demonstrated better healing compared to the HMIS group...|$|E
40|$|Background. Studies {{have shown}} that local use of {{volatile}} anaesthetics produce local anaesthetic effects such as local <b>infiltration</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> (in rats and humans) and spinal anaes-thesia (in dogs). However, {{there is still no}} report on the epidural anaesthetic effect of volatile anaesthetics. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the epidural anaesthetic effect of the 8 % emulsified isoflurane in rabbits. Methods. Forty rabbits chronically instrumented with an epidural catheter were randomly divided into four groups of 10 rabbits each. According to group assignment, rabbits received epidural administration of 8 % emulsified isoflurane (v/v) 1 ml in the E-isoflurane group, 1 % lidocaine 1 ml in the Lidocaine group, 30 % lipid emulsion 1 ml in the Itralipid group, or normal saline 1 ml in the NS group. The sensory and motor functions and the state of consciousness were assessed at baseline and at predetermined regular intervals. Then, the rabbits were con-tinuously observed for 2 weeks to examine the possible long-term neurological complications. Results. The sensory blockade onset time, motor blockade onset time, and motor blockade duration in the E-isoflurane group [1. 4 (0. 7), 1. 6 (0. 7), and 34 (10) min, respectively] were similar to those in the Lidocaine group [1. 3 (0. 5), 1. 7 (0. 8), and 38 (8), min, respectively]...|$|E
40|$|Pain is {{the most}} feared {{consequence}} of malignancy and an important clinical problem. Patients frequently undergo a variety of invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures which may cause pain and anxiety of varying intensity. This is a hitherto relatively unexplored area in adult patients. As an example, bone marrow aspiration/biopsy (BMA) in patients with haematological malignancies is a fundamentally important procedure for establishing the diagnosis, staging and therapeutic monitoring of the disease (1). When BMA is performed, local <b>infiltration</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> (LIA) with lidocaine is commonly used to numb skin and periosteum at the puncture site (2). The specific aims of the work presented in this thesis were to; increase knowledge of the occurrence of pain associated with different procedures (Study I); to evaluate procedure-related pain in patients undergoing BMA and to identify factors related to patients’ perception of pain (Study II), to compare the level of agreement between health-care professionals’ and patients’ ratings of patients’ pain and anxiety during BMA (Study III); to compare the analgesic effect of two different methods of LIA in conjunction with BMA (Study IV). Studies I-III were descriptive and data were collected using questionnaires on patient characteristics and evaluation of perceived pain and anxiety level. Study IV was a randomized double-blind controlled study. Study I revealed that 310 admitted oncological or haematological patients had undergone six (median) procedures during one week, of which 49 % were perceived as painful. Of these, 28 % were reported more painful than expected. BMA was scored {{as one of the}} most painful procedures. In Study II, with 235 haematological patients undergoing BMA, 70 % perceived pain, severe in 30 % of these. Pre-existing pain, anxiety about diagnostic outcome, needle insertion and low employment status were independent factors increasing the risk of experiencing pain during BMA (OR 2. 6; 3. 17; 2. 49; 3. 14, respectively). Twenty-five health care professionals (16 MD, 9 RN) did their own “external” estimate of patients’ levels of pain and anxiety (Study III). Calculation of agreement (proportion of agreement, Cohen’s unweighted kappa coefficient, intra-class correlation) between health care professionals’ and patients’ ratings showed fair agreement for occurrence, and moderate for intensity, of pain. Professionals underestimated severe pain and overestimated mild pain. Agreement on anxiety was poor. Study IV with 50 haematological patients undergoing BMA, compared two methods of LIA in order to find a more effective anaesthetic method for these patients. However, we found no difference in the efficacy of the two methods. In conclusion, hospital care for patients with malignancy includes several painful procedures that were found more painful than expected by 28 % of patients. Haematological patients undergoing BMA usually perceive significant pain that can last up to one week and can be predicted by co-existing factors. Healthcare professionals underestimate patients’ pain and anxiety during BMA. The quality of the two <b>infiltration</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> methods that were compared for BMA was similarly poor...|$|E
40|$|Cervical plexus {{block for}} thyroidectomy patient’s {{preference}} and associated cardiac or pulmonary dis-ease. Cervical plexus block {{has also been}} found useful for thy-roidectomy {{in some parts of}} the world. 3, 5 This particular an-aesthetic option has not been reported in this environment. The aims of the study were: 1. To assess the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of bilat-eral superficial cervical plexus block for thyroidectomy in our hospital. 2. To assess the level of acceptability of superficial cervical plexus block for thyroidectomy amongst our patients. 3. To assess any associated complications specifically related to the procedure. Materials and methods The ethical and research committee of the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Ilorin, approved the study. The study in-cluded seventeen (17) patients above the age of eighteen (18) Thyroidectomy is traditionally performed under general ana-esthesia with endotracheal intubation. This in most cases re-flects surgeon’s and anaesthetist’s preference, as local or re-gional anaesthetic option is rarely offered to patients. How-ever, neither general anaesthesia nor endotracheal intubation is an absolute requirement for thyroidectomy. For selected patients and in certain circumstances, local or regional anaes-thesia may be preferred. There are few reports of successful use of local <b>infiltration</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> for thyroidectomy in Ni-geria. 1, 2 The indication for use of this anaesthetic option have in most cases been the lack of anaesthetic facilities/or per-sonnel, and surgeon’s preference, though with the consent of the patient.

40|$|In using {{procaine}} for local, or <b>infiltration</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> in pa-tients {{suffering from}} myasthenia gravis, Carmichael (1) some-times found a severe exacerbation {{of the general}} muscular weak-ness, which led him to wonder whether procaine affected the transmission of the impulse across the neuro-muscular junction. This was of great interest {{in relation to the}} fact that procaine can relieve certain pathological hypertonic conditions in skeletal muscle and led to this investigation of the action of procaine (and of cocaine for comparison) upon mammalian skeletal muscle in situ. While the work was in progress Harvey (2) at the Nationa 1 Institute for Medical Research, London, was making similar observations on procaine and quinine. PREVIOUS WORK ON SKELETAL MUSCLE It has long been known that the Peruvians, by chewing the prepared leaves of Erythoxylon Coca, are able to perform great feats of endurance with very little food; this was accepted as evidence that the active principles of the leaf reduced fatigue and increased the power of skeletal muscle. But as soon as co-caine was identified, and its local anaesthetic action was es-tablished, it was found that it paralysed skeletal muscle in sub-anaesthetic concentrations. Thus Berthold (3) observed a reversible paralysis of isolated frog’s sartorius bathed in cocaine solution, and Alms (4) a loss of muscle tone in the whole animal after subcutaneous injection. On the other hand, Aschenbrand (5) and Freud (6) found increased resistance to fatigue in th...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} aimed to examine {{hypoperfusion}} {{in response to}} epinephrine following the administration of a local anaesthetic. The. concentration of epinephrine that causes maximal hypoperfusion, the. spread of hypoperfusion in the tissue and the. time to the stabilization of hypoperfusion were investigated. Methods: Blood perfusion was monitored using laser Doppler velocimetry and {{laser speckle contrast imaging}} of random-pattern advancement flaps (1 × 4 cm) or intact skin on the pig flank. Epinephrine was either injected cumulatively (0. 1, 1. 0, 10 or 100 μg/ml) after injecting 20 mg/ml lidocaine, to determine the concentration response, or given as a single dose (12. 5 μg/ml epinephrine. +. 20 mg/ml lidocaine). Control experiments were performed with saline or lidocaine (without epinephrine). Results: Increasing concentrations of epinephrine resulted in a gradual decrease in skin perfusion, approaching a minimum after injecting 10 μg/ml. The area of hypoperfusion was 12 mm in radius, and the time from the injection to the stabilization of hypoperfusion was approximately 120 s. After the administration of 10 μg/ml epinephrine in flaps with small pedicle, 25 % blood perfusion still remained. Conclusions: Local anaesthetic with an epinephrine concentration of approximately 10 μg/ml appears to be adequate for vasoconstriction before surgery. Incisions were required to be delayed only for 2 min following local anaesthetic with epinephrine in pigs. The remaining 25 % blood perfusion observed after the administration of epinephrine supports the use of epinephrine in flaps with a small pedicle. Obviously, these experimental findings must be clinically assessed before being considered for <b>infiltration</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> during plastic surgery procedures...|$|E
40|$|Objective: A {{survey of}} European dental schools was {{conducted}} in 2006 to determine the curricular structure, techniques and materials used in local anaesthesia teaching to dental students. Materials and methods: A questionnaire was designed to collect information about local anaesthesia education. The questionnaires {{were sent to the}} Dean of each dental school in Europe and Israel; 49 returned the completed survey, resulting in a response rate of 18. 4 %. Results: Results from this survey show that dental schools are managing local anaesthesia education in different ways. At most schools, theoretical teaching begins {{during the first half of}} the third year (41 %), half a year before the practical instruction (43 %). In 37 % of the dental schools, students use non-human objects to practice before they inject an anaesthetic in humans. The first injection in humans, usually a fellow student (61 %), is mostly supervised by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon (65 %). The number of injections under supervision usually depends on the individual capabilities of the student (41 %). Ten per cent of the schools need permission of a medical ethics committee for the practical instruction on fellow students. All dental curricula include teaching of mandibular block anaesthesia. The majority also include instruction of <b>infiltration</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> of the upper (98 %) and lower (92 %) jaws in addition to infra-orbital block anaesthesia (57 %). Although 82 % of the schools are satisfied with the current curriculum with regard to local anaesthesia, 43 % are planning changes, frequently the introduction of preclinical training models. Conclusion: Local anaesthesia teaching programmes show considerable variation across the surveyed European dental schools...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} students’ {{opinion about}} theoretical and clinical training in local anaesthesia at different European dental schools. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire {{was designed to}} collect information about local anaesthesia teaching. Students’ opinion was quantified with five-point Likert scales. The web-based questionnaire was distributed through European Dental Students Association contacts amongst students of 25 different dental schools. Eight hundred and eighteen completed questionnaires from students of 12 dental schools were analyzed statistically. Results: Dental schools showed a wide variation {{in the beginning of}} the theoretical teaching of local anaesthesia and the practical teaching. A preclinical training model was used by a small number of students, but these students found it a useful preparation. Many students felt insufficiently prepared when they administered their first injection in a human (17 - 81 %). In dental schools from the UK, Ireland, Sweden and the Netherlands, this first injection is administered to a fellow dental student, whilst in the other countries the first injection is usually performed in a patient. Instruction in mandibular block anaesthesiawas frequently reported (81 - 100 %) as well as in <b>infiltration</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> of the upperand lower jaws (78 - 100 % and 30 - 93 % respectively). Many students expressed that theylike to receive teaching in intraligamentary anaesthesia (13 - 70 %). Other changes in the curriculum were also frequently suggested (33 - 100 %), especially the introduction of preclinical training models and practical teaching earlier in the curriculum. Conclusion: Local anaesthesia teaching programmes and the rating of this teaching by dental students show a considerable variation across European dental schools. Studentsconsidered better preparation highly desirable. The variability in programmes may have implications for mobility of students between European dental schools...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was planned to {{evaluate}} minimally invasive tube cystotomy technique in calves suffering from obstructive urolithiasis having intact urinary bladder and urethra. Fifteen male non-castrated calves with age ranging from 1 - 10 months (mean 4. 05 months), presented for treatment within one to three days (mean 2. 2 days) of complete urinary tract obstruction due to urethral calculi with intact bladder and urethra, were included in this study. Under light sedation and local <b>infiltration</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> all the animals were subjected through left paralumbar fossa, to a minimally invasive surgical tube cystotomy in which catheter {{was placed in the}} bladder lumen through a metallic cannula and fixed to the skin with a stay suture (Fazili’s technique). All the animals were discharged the same day. Time taken for the procedure varied from 8 to 17 minutes (mean 11. 0 minutes). Normal urination resumed in twelve (80. 0 %) calves. Mean time taken for normal urination was 10. 50 days. In two of the remaining calves, urine flow stopped through the catheter prematurely and they were then subjected to standard surgical tube cystotomy. One more calf did not urinate normally for 30 postoperative days and was lost to the follow up thereafter. Recurrence of the obstruction was not detected in ten and nine animals observed up to six and 12 months respectively. In conclusion, the outcome of this minimally invasive technique is similar to the standard tube cystectomy. Additionally, the procedure is cost effective, quick, simple and field applicable. It also minimizes exposure of abdominal cavity of metabolically compromised animals. However, the technique needs to be tried in larger number of such calves wherein better quality catheter of larger diameter be used before recommending its extensive use...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of topical anesthetics {{can serve as}} a better alternative to <b>infiltration</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> for short dermatosurgical procedures. EMLA cream (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics), a topical local anesthetic cream has been shown to penetrate intact skin and provide analgesia of superficial layers. Very few comparative studies are available and therefore data regarding the efficacy and patient acceptability of EMLA over lignocaine infiltration are limited. So, with this background the present prospective study was planned to compare the efficacy, safety and patient acceptability of topical EMLA cream with lignocaine infiltration in patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation of warts from the intact skin of face and neck. A total of 40 volunteer patients with 10 – 15 warts present on face and neck were divided into two groups (group A and B), 20 patients in each group. Group A received lignocaine infiltration and group B received topical EMLA cream under occlusive dressing. The procedure was executed after 5 min of lignocaine infiltration and 30 min of EMLA application. Pain assessment was done using VAS (visual analogue score). Pain assessment was done both at the time of application and during the procedure. Extent of the pain was also assessed by the patient on a verbal rating. The results of the study show that lignocaine infiltration caused mild to moderate pain except one patient. On the other hand none of the patient experienced any type of pain on application of EMLA cream. The pain assessment during the anesthetics application, lignocaine infiltrated patients revealed significantly higher VAS score in comparison with the EMLA application (3. 3 ± 0. 865, 0. 0; P< 0. 001). However, during the surgical procedure, EMLA applied patients experienced significantly higher VAS score in comparison with the lignocaine infiltrated patients (P< 0. 05). The patient acceptability to the EMLA application was found to be more in comparison with lignocaine. Adverse events were mild and comparable in both the groups. In conclusion EMLA is an efficacious alternative to lignocaine infiltration for radiofrequency ablation of warts and has better patient acceptability...|$|E
