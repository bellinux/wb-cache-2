Aided by an able minister, José Bonifácio de Andrada, he searched for support outside Rio de Janeiro. The prince traveled to Minas Gerais in April and on to São Paulo in August. He was welcomed warmly in both Brazilian provinces, and the visits reinforced his authority. While returning from São Paulo, he received news sent on 7 September that the Cortes would not accept self-governance in Brazil and would punish all who disobeyed its orders. [...] "Never one to eschew the most dramatic action on the immediate impulse", said Barman about the prince, he [...] "required no more time for decision than {{the reading of the}} letters demanded."
