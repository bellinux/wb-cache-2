5|$|Serotonin {{syndrome}} is typically {{caused by the}} use of two or more serotonergic medications or drugs. This may include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), amphetamines, pethidine (meperidine), tramadol, <b>dextromethorphan,</b> buspirone, L-tryptophan, 5-HTP, St. John's wort, triptans, ecstasy (MDMA), metoclopramide, ondansetron, or cocaine. It occurs in about 15% of SSRI overdoses. It is a predictable consequence of excess serotonin on the central nervous system (CNS). Onset of symptoms is typically within a day of the extra serotonin.|$|E
5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of <b>dextromethorphan</b> (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E
25|$|The {{first pass}} through the hepatic portal vein results {{in some of the}} drug being metabolized by O-demethylation into an active {{metabolite}} of <b>dextromethorphan</b> called dextrorphan (DXO). DXO is the 3-hydroxy derivative of <b>dextromethorphan.</b> The therapeutic activity of <b>dextromethorphan</b> is believed to be caused by both the drug and this metabolite. <b>Dextromethorphan</b> also undergoes N-demethylation (to 3-methoxymorphinan or MEM), and partial conjugation with glucuronic acid and sulfate ions. Hours after <b>dextromethorphan</b> therapy, (in humans) the metabolites (+)-3-hydroxy-N-methylmorphinan, (+)-3-morphinan, and traces of the unchanged drug are detectable in the urine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dextromethorphan</b> {{should not}} be taken with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) due to the {{potential}} for serotonin syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur rapidly, due to a buildup of an excessive amount of serotonin in the body. <b>Dextromethorphan</b> can also cause serotonin syndrome when used with SSRI medicines, an interaction which has been documented in clinical cases where <b>dextromethorphan</b> is taken at recreational doses. The link between therapeutic dosages of <b>dextromethorphan</b> and serotonin syndrome has been suggested to be less conclusive.|$|E
25|$|Misuse of multi-symptom cold medications, {{rather than}} using a cough {{suppressant}} whose sole active ingredient is <b>dextromethorphan,</b> carries significant risk of fatality or serious illness. Multi-symptom cold medicines contain other active ingredients, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen), chlorpheniramine, and phenylephrine, any of which can cause permanent bodily damage such as kidney failure, or even death, if taken on the generally accepted recreational dosing scale of <b>dextromethorphan.</b> Sorbitol, an artificial sweetener found in many cough syrups containing <b>dextromethorphan,</b> can also have negative side effects including diarrhea and nausea when taken at recreational dosages of <b>dextromethorphan.</b> Guaifenesin, an expectorant commonly accompanying <b>dextromethorphan</b> in cough preparations, can cause unpleasant symptoms including vomiting, nausea, kidney stones, and headache.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dextromethorphan</b> is the {{dextrorotatory}} enantiomer of levomethorphan, {{which is}} the methyl ether of levorphanol, both opioid analgesics. It is named according to IUPAC rules as (+)-3-methoxy-17-methyl-9α,13α,14α-morphinan. As its pure form, <b>dextromethorphan</b> occurs as an odorless, opalescent white powder. It is freely soluble in chloroform and insoluble in water; the hydrobromide salt is water-soluble up to 1.5g/100 mL at 25°C. <b>Dextromethorphan</b> is commonly available as the monohydrated hydrobromide salt, however some newer extended-release formulations contain <b>dextromethorphan</b> bound to an ion-exchange resin based on polystyrene sulfonic acid. Dextromethorphan's specific rotation in water is +27.6° (20°C, Sodium D-line).|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a marked}} {{difference}} between <b>dextromethorphan</b> hydrobromide, contained in most cough suppressant preparations, and <b>dextromethorphan</b> polistirex, contained in the brand name preparation Delsym. Polistirex is a polymer that is bonded to the <b>dextromethorphan</b> that requires more time for the stomach to digest it as it requires that an ion exchange reaction take place prior to its dissolution into the blood. Because of this, <b>dextromethorphan</b> polistirex takes considerably longer to absorb, resulting in more gradual and longer lasting effects reminiscent of time release pills. As a cough suppressant, the polistirex version lasts up to 12 hours. This duration also holds true when used recreationally.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>dextromethorphan</b> {{can trigger}} a {{histamine}} release (allergic reaction), atopic children, who are especially susceptible to allergic reactions, should be administered <b>dextromethorphan</b> only if absolutely necessary, and only under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.|$|E
25|$|Dextrorphan: active {{metabolite}} of <b>dextromethorphan.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Director of Narcotics, Psychotropics, and Addictive Substances Control (NAPZA) BPOM-RI, Dr. Danardi Sosrosumihardjo, SpKJ, {{explains}} that <b>dextromethorphan,</b> morphine, and heroin {{are derived from}} the same tree, and states the effect of <b>dextromethorphan</b> to be equivalent to 1/100 of morphine and injected heroin.|$|E
25|$|The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) {{receptor}} {{seems to}} play a major role in neuropathic pain and in the development of opioid tolerance. <b>Dextromethorphan</b> is an NMDA antagonist at high doses. Experiments in both animals and humans have established that NMDA antagonists such as ketamine and <b>dextromethorphan</b> can alleviate neuropathic pain and reverse opioid tolerance. Unfortunately, only a few NMDA antagonists are clinically available and their use is limited by a very short half life (<b>dextromethorphan),</b> weak activity (memantine) or unacceptable side effects (ketamine).|$|E
25|$|Caution {{should be}} {{exercised}} when taking <b>dextromethorphan</b> when drinking grapefruit juice or eating grapefruits, as compounds in grapefruit affect {{a number of}} drugs, including <b>dextromethorphan,</b> through the inhibition of the cytochrome p450 system in the liver, {{and can lead to}} excessive accumulation and prolonged effects. Grapefruit and grapefruit juices (especially white grapefruit juice, but also including other citrus fruits such as bergamot and lime, {{as well as a number}} of noncitrus fruits) generally are recommended to be avoided while using <b>dextromethorphan</b> and numerous other medications.|$|E
25|$|Dextrallorphan: a {{more potent}} {{analogue}} of <b>dextromethorphan.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Dextromethorphan</b> was {{excluded}} from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970 and was specifically {{excluded from the}} Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. As of 2010, <b>Dextromethorphan</b> was still excluded from U.S. scheduling of controlled substances; however, officials have warned that it could still be added if increased abuse warrants its scheduling. The motivation behind its exclusion from the CSA was that, under the CSA, all optical isomers of listed Schedule II opiates are automatically Schedule II substances. Since <b>dextromethorphan</b> is an optical isomer of the Schedule II opiate levomethorphan (but does not act like an opiate), an exemption was necessary {{to keep it a}} non-controlled substance. The Federal Analog Act does not apply to <b>dextromethorphan</b> because a new drug application has been filed for it.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the FDA {{approved}} the combination product dextromethorphan/quinidine {{for the treatment}} of pseudobulbar affect (emotional lability). <b>Dextromethorphan</b> is the actual therapeutic agent in the combination; quinidine merely serves to inhibit the enzymatic degradation of <b>dextromethorphan</b> and thereby increase its circulating concentrations via inhibition of CYP2D6.|$|E
25|$|NMDA antagonists, such as <b>dextromethorphan,</b> ketamine, and memantine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dextromethorphan</b> (DXM or DM) {{is a drug}} of the morphinan {{class with}} sedative, dissociative, and {{stimulant}} properties (at higher doses). It is a cough suppressant in many over-the-counter cold and cough medicines including generic labels and store brands, Benylin DM, Mucinex DM, Camydex-20 tablets, Robitussin, NyQuil, Dimetapp, Vicks, Coricidin, Delsym, TheraFlu, Cheracol D, and others. <b>Dextromethorphan</b> has also found numerous other uses in medicine, ranging from pain relief (as either the primary analgesic, or an opioid potentiator) over psychological applications {{to the treatment of}} addiction. It is sold in syrup, tablet, spray, and lozenge forms. In its pure form, <b>dextromethorphan</b> occurs as a white powder.|$|E
25|$|Combining <b>dextromethorphan</b> {{with other}} {{substances}} can compound risks. Central nervous-system stimulants such as amphetamine and/or cocaine {{can cause a}} dangerous rise in blood pressure and heart rate. CNS depressants such as ethanol (drinking alcohol) will have a combined depressant effect, which can cause a decreased respiratory rate. Combining <b>dextromethorphan</b> with other CYP2D6 substrates can cause both drugs to build to dangerous levels in the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dextromethorphan</b> {{had been}} thought to cause Olney's lesions when {{administered}} intravenously; however, this was later proven inconclusive, {{due to lack}} of research on humans. Tests were performed on rats, giving them 50mg and up every day up to a month. Neurotoxic changes, including vacuolation, have been observed in posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices of rats administered other NMDA antagonists such as PCP, but not with <b>dextromethorphan.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dextromethorphan's {{euphoric effects}} have {{sometimes}} {{been attributed to}} an increase in dopamine levels, since such an increase generally correlates with pleasurable responses to drug, as is observed with some clinical antidepressants, as well as some recreational drugs. However, the effects of dextrorphan and <b>dextromethorphan,</b> and other NMDA receptor antagonists, on dopamine levels is a disputed subject. Studies show that the NMDA receptor antagonists ketamine and PCP do raise dopamine levels, although other studies show that another NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine has no effect on dopamine levels. Some findings even suggest that <b>dextromethorphan</b> can actually counter the dopamine-increasing effect caused by morphine. Due to these conflicting results, the actual effect of <b>dextromethorphan</b> on dopamine levels remains undetermined.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary use}} of <b>dextromethorphan</b> is as a cough suppressant, for the {{temporary}} relief of cough caused by minor throat and bronchial irritation (such as commonly accompanies the flu and common cold), {{as well as}} those resulting from inhaled particle irritants. However, controlled studies have found the symptomatic effectiveness of <b>dextromethorphan</b> similar to placebo. This could also serve {{as an example of the}} power of the placebo effect.|$|E
25|$|DXM has an {{elimination}} half-life {{of approximately}} 4hours in individuals with an extensive metabolizer phenotype; this is increased to approximately 13hours when DXM {{is given in}} combination with quinidine. The duration of action after oral administration is about three to eight hours for <b>dextromethorphan</b> hydrobromide, and 10 to 12 hours for <b>dextromethorphan</b> polistirex. Around one in 10 of the Caucasian population {{has little or no}} CYP2D6 enzyme activity, leading to long-lived high drug levels.|$|E
25|$|The sale of <b>dextromethorphan</b> in its pure {{powder form}} may incur penalties, {{although}} no explicit law exists prohibiting its sale or possession, {{other than in}} the state of Illinois. There have been cases of individuals being sentenced to time in prison and other penalties for selling pure <b>dextromethorphan</b> in this form, because of the incidental violation of more general laws for the sale of legitimate drugs — such as resale of a medication without proper warning labels.|$|E
25|$|Antitussive {{preparations}} containing <b>dextromethorphan</b> {{are legal}} to purchase from pharmacies in most countries, with some exceptions being UAE, Sweden, Estonia and Latvia.|$|E
25|$|Following oral administration, <b>dextromethorphan</b> {{is rapidly}} absorbed from the {{gastrointestinal}} tract, where {{it enters the}} bloodstream and crosses the blood–brain barrier.|$|E
25|$|Combining <b>dextromethorphan</b> {{with other}} serotonergic drugs could {{possibly}} cause serotonin toxicity, {{an excess of}} serotonergic activity in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS).|$|E
25|$|In many {{documented}} cases, <b>dextromethorphan</b> {{has produced}} psychological dependence {{in people who}} used it recreationally. However, it does not produce physical addiction, according to the WHO Committee on Drug Dependence. It is considered less addictive than the other common weak opiate cough suppressant, codeine. Since <b>dextromethorphan</b> also acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) users describe that regular recreational use {{over a longer period}} of time can cause withdrawal symptoms that are similar to those of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. Additionally, disturbances have been reported in: sleep, senses, movement, mood, and thinking.|$|E
25|$|In Russia, <b>dextromethorphan</b> (commonly {{sold under}} the brand names Tussin+ and Glycodin) is a Schedule III {{controlled}} substance and {{is placed in}} the same list as benzodiazepines and the majority of barbiturates.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dextromethorphan</b> {{has been}} noted to slow the {{development}} of tolerance to opioids and exert additional analgesia by acting upon the NMDA receptors; some analgesics such as methadone and ketobemidone and perhaps piritramide have intrinsic NMDA action.|$|E
25|$|The salts {{pseudoephedrine}} hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine sulfate {{are found}} in many over-the-counter preparations, either as a single ingredient or (more commonly) in combination with antihistamines, guaifenesin, <b>dextromethorphan,</b> and/or paracetamol (acetaminophen) or an NSAID (such as aspirin or ibuprofen).|$|E
25|$|Some NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists, such as ketamine, <b>dextromethorphan</b> (DXM), phencyclidine (PCP), methoxetamine (MXE), and {{nitrous oxide}} (N2O), are popular recreational drugs used for their dissociative, hallucinogenic, and euphoriant properties. When used recreationally, they {{are classified as}} dissociative drugs.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the other}} {{well-known}} dissociatives phencyclidine (PCP) and <b>dextromethorphan</b> (DXM), ketamine is very short-acting. It takes effect within about 10 minutes, while its hallucinogenic effects last 60 minutes when insufflated or injected {{and up to}} two hours when ingested orally.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dextromethorphan</b> (the {{stereoisomer}} of levomethorphan, a semi-synthetic opioid agonist) and its metabolite dextrorphan have no {{opioid analgesic}} effect at all despite their structural similarity to other opioids; instead they are potent NMDA antagonists and sigma 1 and 2-receptor agonists {{and are used}} in many over-the-counter cough suppressants.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, <b>dextromethorphan</b> became {{available}} in an over-the-counter tablet form by {{the brand name}} Romilar. In 1973, Romilar {{was taken off the}} shelves after a burst in sales because of frequent misuse, and was replaced by cough syrup in an attempt to cut down on abuse. The advent of widespread internet access in the 1990s allowed users to rapidly disseminate information about DXM, and online discussion groups formed around use and acquisition of the drug. As early as 1996, DXM HBr powder could be purchased in bulk from online retailers, allowing users to avoid consuming DXM in syrup preparations. As of January 1, 2012, <b>dextromethorphan</b> is prohibited for sale to minors in the state of California, except with a doctor's prescription.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, a {{paper by}} Gosselin {{estimated}} that the lethal dose is between 50 and 500mg/kg. Doses as high as 15–20mg/kg are taken by some recreational users. It is suggested by a single case study that the antidote to <b>dextromethorphan</b> overdose is naloxone, administered intravenously.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of these}} psychotomimetic effects, NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists, especially phencyclidine, ketamine, and <b>dextromethorphan,</b> {{are used as}} recreational drugs. At subanesthetic doses, these drugs have mild stimulant effects and, at higher doses, begin inducing dissociation and hallucinations, though these effects and the strength thereof vary from drug to drug.|$|E
