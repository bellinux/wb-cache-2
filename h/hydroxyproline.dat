5|$|Aside {{from the}} 22 proteinogenic amino acids, many non-proteinogenic amino acids are known. Those either are {{not found in}} {{proteins}} (for example carnitine, GABA, Levothyroxine) or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery (for example, <b>hydroxyproline</b> and selenomethionine).|$|E
5|$|Nonstandard {{amino acids}} are usually formed through {{modifications}} to standard amino acids. For example, homocysteine is formed through the transsulfuration pathway {{or by the}} demethylation of methionine via the intermediate metabolite S-adenosyl methionine, while <b>hydroxyproline</b> is made by a posttranslational modification of proline.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} have biological functions. For example, {{in the human}} brain, glutamate (standard glutamic acid) and gamma-amino-butyric acid ("GABA", non-standard gamma-amino acid) are, respectively, the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. <b>Hydroxyproline,</b> {{a major component of}} the connective tissue collagen, is synthesised from proline. Glycine is a biosynthetic precursor to porphyrins used in red blood cells. Carnitine is used in lipid transport.|$|E
5|$|Unburnt bone can be tested; it is usual to date {{it using}} collagen, the protein {{fraction}} that remains after washing away the bone's structural material. <b>Hydroxyproline,</b> {{one of the}} constituent amino acids in bone, was {{once thought to be}} a reliable indicator as it was not known to occur except in bone, but it has since been detected in groundwater.|$|E
5|$|HypSys are {{localised}} in {{the cell}} wall. The precursor for tobacco HypSys is transcribed as a 165 amino acid polypeptide which has no structural homology to the precursor for systemin in tomato. The structural properties of HypSys, containing <b>hydroxyproline</b> and being glycosylated, indicate that they are synthesised through the secretory system. The precursor to HypSys in tomato is a 146 amino acid polypeptide, exclusively synthesised within the vascular bundles of leaves and petioles associated with parenchyma cells of phloem bundles. Unlike systemin, it is primarily associated with the cell wall. The precursors to HypSys appear to represent a distinct subfamily of hydroxyproline-rich proteins found in cell walls. Upon wounding {{it is thought that}} a protease from the cytosol, the cell wall matrix, or the pathogen, processes the precursor producing active HypSys peptides.|$|E
25|$|Imino acids {{typically}} {{contain an}} imine functional group, {{instead of the}} amino group found in amino acids. Proline is considered and usually referred to as an amino acid, but unlike others, it has a secondary amine. This feature, unique to proline, identifies proline also as an imino acid. <b>Hydroxyproline</b> is another imino acid, made from the naturally occurring hydroxylation of proline.|$|E
25|$|Glycine, proline and <b>hydroxyproline</b> {{share common}} renal tubular {{mechanisms}} of reabsorption, a function {{specific to the}} proximal tubule. Both reabsorption or absorption of glycine and imino acids takes place respectively at the proximal tubule or intestinal brush border epithelium. The more selective transport of proline and other imino acids is driven {{at the molecular level}} by a mammalian cellular transport mechanism aptly known as system IMINO.|$|E
25|$|Another {{mutation}} suspected {{to convey}} the iminoglycinuria phenotype {{may be found in}} the SLC36A1 (PAT1) gene. Identified as the low-affinity intestinal transporter of glycine and imino acids, PAT1 works in cooperation with the renal sodium-hydrogen exchanger NHE3 (SLC9A3). As absorption and reabsorption of glycine, proline and <b>hydroxyproline</b> occurs through PAT1 as well, it is believed to play another role in expressing the malabsorptive iminoglycinuria phenotype. Recent reports, however, suggest a more diminished role from PAT1 in some cases of the disorder.|$|E
25|$|Defined as the sodium-dependent proline {{transporter}} not inhibited by alanine, system IMINO, {{believed to}} be formed by the SLC6A20 (SIT1) gene, is a crucial mammalian transport mechanism responsible for both renal reabsorption and intestinal absorption of proline and other imino acids, such as <b>hydroxyproline</b> and pipecolate. The mRNA sequence for SIT1 is expressed in {{a great deal of}} the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum and colon. It is also found in the kidney, optical choroid, and parts of the central nervous system such the brain and microglial cells.|$|E
25|$|Ascorbic acid {{is needed}} {{for a variety of}} biosynthetic pathways, by {{accelerating}} hydroxylation and amidation reactions. In the synthesis of collagen, ascorbic acid is required as a cofactor for prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase. These two enzymes are responsible for the hydroxylation of the proline and lysine amino acids in collagen. <b>Hydroxyproline</b> and hydroxylysine are important for stabilizing collagen by cross-linking the propeptides in collagen. Defective collagen fibrillogenesis impairs wound healing. Collagen {{is an important part of}} bone, so bone formation is affected. Defective connective tissue leads to fragile capillaries, resulting in abnormal bleeding. Untreated scurvy is invariably fatal.|$|E
25|$|While {{no single}} genetic {{mutation}} {{has been established}} {{as the cause of}} iminoglycinuria; several mutations, affecting transport mechanisms shared by glycine, proline and <b>hydroxyproline,</b> as well as those that selectively transport either glycine or imino acids, including the IMINO system, are known {{to be associated with the}} disorder. When combined, these factors will result in a variable phenotype for iminoglycinuria depending on which mutations are present. However, despite the role that intestinal malabsorption of glycine and imino acids can play in iminoglycinuria, the primary defect disrupts their renal transport and reabsorption. This is evident, as inherited iminoglycinuria can be clinically present with no intestinal involvement.|$|E
25|$|The primary defect {{associated}} with iminoglycinuria is a homozygous (recessive) mutation of the SLC36A2 (PAT2) gene. One of several membrane transport proteins in the {{solute carrier family}} of amino acid transporters, PAT2 is the high-affinity renal transporter of glycine, proline and <b>hydroxyproline</b> found to be defective in both alleles when iminoglycinuria is present in an individual. This {{is in contrast to}} the fact that when only one PAT2 allele is defective, hyperglycinuria will be present instead of iminoglycinuria. These findings delineate iminoglycinuria as the homozygous form of hyperglycinuria, with the former having a higher degree of urinary excretion of glycine and imino acids correlating to mutations in both alleles.|$|E
25|$|Gelatin is {{a mixture}} of {{peptides}} and proteins produced by partial hydrolysis of collagen extracted from the skin, bones, and connective tissues of animals such as domesticated cattle, chicken, pigs, and fish. During hydrolysis, the natural molecular bonds between individual collagen strands are broken down into a form that rearranges more easily. Its chemical composition is, in many aspects, closely similar to that of its parent collagen. Photographic and pharmaceutical grades of gelatin generally are sourced from cattle bones and pig skin. Gelatin has proline, <b>hydroxyproline</b> and glycine in its polypeptide chain. Glycine is responsible for close packing of the chains. Presence of proline restricts the conformation. This is important for gelation properties of gelatin.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{structural}} proteins (1-5%) {{are found}} in most plant cell walls; they are classified as hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGP), arabinogalactan proteins (AGP), glycine-rich proteins (GRPs), and proline-rich proteins (PRPs). Each class of glycoprotein is defined by a characteristic, highly repetitive protein sequence. Most are glycosylated, contain <b>hydroxyproline</b> (Hyp) and become cross-linked in the cell wall. These proteins are often concentrated in specialized cells and in cell corners. Cell walls of the epidermis may contain cutin. The Casparian strip in the endodermis roots and cork cells of plant bark contain suberin. Both cutin and suberin are polyesters that function as permeability barriers to the movement of water. The relative composition of carbohydrates, secondary compounds and proteins varies between plants and between the cell type and age. Plant cells walls also contain numerous enzymes, such as hydrolases, esterases, peroxidases, and transglycosylases, that cut, trim and cross-link wall polymers.|$|E
500|$|Non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} {{that are found}} in {{proteins}} are formed by post-translational modification, which is modification after translation during protein synthesis. These modifications are often essential for the function or regulation of a protein. [...] For example, the carboxylation of glutamate allows for better binding of calcium cations, and [...] collagen contains <b>hydroxyproline,</b> generated by hydroxylation of proline. Another example is the formation of hypusine in the translation initiation factor EIF5A, through modification of a lysine residue. Such modifications can also determine the localization of the protein, e.g., the addition of long hydrophobic groups can cause a protein to bind to a phospholipid membrane.|$|E
500|$|Ascorbic acid or [...] "vitamin C" [...] is a {{monosaccharide}} oxidation-reduction (redox) catalyst {{found in}} both animals and plants. As {{one of the}} enzymes needed to make ascorbic acid has been lost by mutation during primate evolution, humans must obtain it from the diet; it is therefore a vitamin. Most other animals are able to produce this compound in their bodies and do not require it in their diets. Ascorbic acid {{is required for the}} conversion of the procollagen to collagen by oxidizing proline residues to <b>hydroxyproline.</b> In other cells, it is maintained in its reduced form by reaction with glutathione, which can be catalysed by protein disulfide isomerase and glutaredoxins. Ascorbic acid is a redox catalyst which can reduce, and thereby neutralize, reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. In addition to its direct antioxidant effects, ascorbic acid is also a substrate for the redox enzyme ascorbate peroxidase, a function that is particularly important in stress resistance in plants. Ascorbic acid is present at high levels in all parts of plants and can reach concentrations of 20millimolar in chloroplasts.|$|E

2500|$|Iminoglycinuria, {{sometimes}} called familial iminoglycinuria, is an autosomal recessive disorder of renal tubular transport affecting reabsorption of the amino acid glycine, and the imino acids proline and <b>hydroxyproline.</b> This results in excess urinary excretion {{of all three}} acids (-uria denotes [...] "in the urine").|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} function of glycine is as {{a precursor to}} proteins. Most proteins incorporate only small quantities of glycine, a notable exception being collagen, which contains about 35% glycine due to its periodically repeated role {{in the formation of}} collagen's helix structure in conjunction with <b>hydroxyproline.</b> In the genetic code, glycine is coded by all codons [...] starting with GG, namely GGU, GGC, GGA and GGG.|$|E
2500|$|The group Oomycetes, {{also known}} as water molds, are saprotrophic plant {{pathogens}} like fungi. Until recently they were widely believed to be fungi, but structural and molecular evidence has led to their reclassification as heterokonts, related to autotrophic brown algae and diatoms. [...] Unlike fungi, oomycetes typically possess cell walls of cellulose and glucans rather than chitin, although some genera (such as Achlya and Saprolegnia) do have chitin in their walls. [...] The fraction of cellulose in the walls {{is no more than}} 4 to 20%, far less than the fraction of glucans. [...] Oomycete cell walls also contain the amino acid <b>hydroxyproline,</b> which is not found in fungal cell walls.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydroxyproline</b> {{is found}} in few {{proteins}} other than collagen. For this reason, <b>hydroxyproline</b> content {{has been used as}} an indicator to determine collagen and/or gelatin amount.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydroxyproline</b> {{is a major}} {{component}} of the protein collagen, comprising roughly 13.5% of mammalian collagen. <b>Hydroxyproline</b> and proline play key roles for collagen stability. They permit the sharp twisting of the collagen helix. In the canonical collagen Xaa-Yaa-Gly triad (where Xaa and Yaa are any amino acid), a proline occupying the Yaa position is hydroxylated to give a Xaa-Hyp-Gly sequence. This modification of the proline residue increases the stability of the collagen triple helix. It was initially proposed that the stabilization was due to water molecules forming a hydrogen bonding network linking the prolyl hydroxyl groups and the main-chain carbonyl groups. It was subsequently shown that the increase in stability is primarily through stereoelectronic effects and that hydration of the <b>hydroxyproline</b> residues provides little or no additional stability. In addition to collagen, the mammalian proteins elastin and argonaute 2 have collagen-like domains in which <b>hydroxyproline</b> is formed. Some snail poisons, conotoxins, contain <b>hydroxyproline,</b> but lack collagen-like sequences.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of isomerases, {{specifically}} those racemases and epimerases acting on amino acids and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxyproline 2-epimerase. Other names in common use include <b>hydroxyproline</b> epimerase, <b>hydroxyproline</b> 2-epimerase, and L-hydroxyproline epimerase. This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism.|$|E
50|$|Elevated {{levels of}} {{serum and urinary}} <b>hydroxyproline</b> are also found.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydroxyproline</b> rich glycoproteins {{are also}} found in plant cell walls.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hydroxyproline</b> is {{produced}} by hydroxylation of the amino acid proline by the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase following protein synthesis (as a post-translational modification). The enzyme catalysed reaction {{takes place in the}} lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Although it is not directly incorporated into proteins, <b>hydroxyproline</b> comprises roughly 4% of all amino acids found in animal tissue, an amount greater than seven other amino acids that are translationally incorporated.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydroxyproline</b> {{differs from}} proline by the {{presence}} of a hydroxyl (OH) group attached to the gamma carbon atom.|$|E
50|$|Proline is also {{hydroxylated}} in collagen, however, no glycosylation occurs {{here as the}} hydroxyprolines {{are necessary}} for hydrogen bonding in the collagen triple helix. There is one protein named Skp1 in Dictyostelium discoideum that carries a GlcNAc on <b>hydroxyproline,</b> but this {{would appear to be}} an extremely rare form of glycosylation. Otherwise, only plants appear to carry glycans on <b>hydroxyproline,</b> with both galactose and arabinose glycans being reported in the literature.|$|E
50|$|In 1902, Hermann Emil Fischer {{isolated}} <b>hydroxyproline</b> from hydrolyzed gelatin. In 1905, Hermann Leuchs synthesized a {{racemic mixture}} of 4-hydroxyproline.|$|E
50|$|Most {{proteins}} and peptides contain both alcohols and amino groups. Two amino acids are alkanolamines, formally speaking: serine and <b>hydroxyproline.</b>|$|E
50|$|This pentapeptide {{consists}} of serine (Ser) and four hydroxyprolines (Hyp): Ser-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp. <b>Hydroxyproline</b> is unusual {{not only as}} a cyclic amino acid that restricts peptide flexibility but as an amino acid with no codon, being encoded as proline. Polypeptides targeted for secretion are subsequently hydroxylated by direct addition of molecular oxygen to proline at C-4. Extensin <b>hydroxyproline</b> is uniquely glycosylated with short chains of L-arabinose that further rigidify and increase hydrophilicity. Generally the serine has a single galactose attached.|$|E
