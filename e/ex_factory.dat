At the end of 2002 the works closed. It was then an {{industrial}} estate (appropriately called [...] "Vulcan Industrial Estate"). The site is just north of Winwick Junction where the line to Newton-le-Willows branches off to the west from the West Coast Main Line.

40|$|Purpose – The {{need for}} an {{efficient}} provision of product variety has been widely established {{as a means of}} competing in the marketplace, yet previous studies into the management of product variety have commonly analysed products in isolated developed markets. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate how firms manage their product variety in emerging markets. This paper aims to investigate the rationale underlying the restriction of variety in such settings, and define general mechanisms by which firms can adapt their product variety when operating in both emerging and developed markets simultaneously. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses the case of a global vehicle manufacturer that offers common products across developed and emerging markets to illustrate the difference between them in terms of product variety, and examine the process that underlies its management. The paper utilises a combination of data collection techniques. Findings – The paper shows empirically how product variety (in particular <b>ex</b> <b>factory</b> variety) is restricted in emerging markets, as one would expect, and it identifies the mechanisms by which product variety is managed across different markets. The paper further illustrates how emerging markets have developed secondary coping mechanisms to deliver additional variety through late configuration in the distribution system. Originality/value – By examining the differential management of product variety in emerging and developed markets, the findings yield several novel aspects by providing both empirical evidence and explanations for the restriction of product variety in emerging markets...|$|E

40|$|In the Republic of Macedonia, the {{procurement}} of medicines from Positive List (PL) {{was carried out}} by the Health Insurance Fund (HIF) through centralized international tenders until 2005. The main criterion for selecting the best tender offer, was the medicine price, which determined its reimbursment cost. The last International tender took place in 2005 and it was valid until the agred quantities of medicines were consumed. The external reference pricing system was established in 2007. Its latest methodology uses the comparative reimburses for the PL medicines, and it takes into consideration the Purchasing Parity Power.

Following disposal of Packard's body supplier, Briggs, to Chrysler, Packard bought the old Connor Avenue Briggs plant to produce their own bodies and switched entire production there completely, abandoning the East Grand Boulevard plant. Quality control was terrible and because of this, and a failure by American Motors to buy as many Ultramatic transmission units and Packard V-8's as Nance had hoped for, Packard production was eliminated at the firm's <b>ex</b> Briggs Detroit <b>factory</b> and transferred to Studebaker's South Bend complex for the 1957 model year.|$|R

A large flour mill in Jakarta was selected to assess the occupational {{health and safety}} profile of such industries.

Most employees adopted non-ergonomic posture during work at the packing unit. This increased complaints of low back pain and varicose veins. Work accidents frequently occurred at the workshop, but not at the drilling unit. Indiscriminate positioning of materials was observed at the workshop. Finally, we recommend health promotion on the use of protective equipment for disease prevention...|$|R
