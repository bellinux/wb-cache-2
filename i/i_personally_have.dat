[...] "ow I'm like, 'Dude, you {{have been doing this}} for 13 years and if I make it {{to the end of the}} contract, it will be 17 years.' Seventeen years is a long time.

500|$|On 6 February 1957, the Soviet {{government}} {{released a}} document dated 17 July 1947, which stated [...] "I {{report that the}} prisoner Wallenberg who is well-known to you, died suddenly in his cell this night, probably {{as a result of}} a heart attack or heart failure. Pursuant to the instructions given by you that <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> <b>have</b> Wallenberg under my care, I request approval to make an autopsy with a view to establishing cause of death.... I have personally notified the minister and it has been ordered that the body be cremated without autopsy." [...] The document was signed by Smoltsov, then the head of the Lubyanka prison infirmary, and addressed to Viktor Abakumov, the Soviet minister of state security. In 1989, Wallenberg's personal belongings were returned to his family, including his passport and cigarette case. Soviet officials said they found the materials when they were upgrading the shelves in a store room.|$|E
2500|$|After {{about three}} years' {{working with them}} he finally fell out with the Cologne School, this being too dogmatic and {{involving}} much factional in-fighting: [...] "there were [...] {{a lot of political}} fighting because different people, like Stockhausen, like Kagel wanted to be first.

60|$|But, as I {{pointed out}} to him, it really didn't matter whom Robina blamed. We talked about women {{generally}} on our way back. I told him--impressing upon him {{there was no need}} for it to go farther--that <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> <b>had</b> come to the conclusion that the best way to deal with women was to treat them all as children. He agreed it might be a good method, but wanted to know what you did when they treated you as a child.|$|R

[...] "We are {{all very}} anxious indeed to hear the result of your {{interview}} with Brott--and apart from that, <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> <b>have</b> too few opportunities to act as your escort to let a chance go by. I trust that my presence is not displeasing to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you mean," [...] he said. [...] "It drove me from the East to the West. We should preach at the one and feed the other!... Of course, <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> <b>have</b> always been handicapped. I haven't been able to {{subscribe}} {{to any of the}} established churches. But I do believe in the laws of retribution, whether you call them human or Divine. One's moral delinquencies pay one out just as bodily excesses do. Always one's debts are to be paid, and it's a terrible burden the drones must carry. After all, I've {{come to the conclusion that}} there's heaps of sound moral teaching to be drummed into our fellow-creatures without the necessity of being orthodox!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop a moment, my dear," [...] he said quite kindly, {{but very}} decisively. [...] "If {{you have any}} idea at the back of your head, that <b>I,</b> <b>personally,</b> <b>have</b> any {{influence}} at my command with regard to Luke de Mountford's fate, then the sooner you get that idea out of your head the better. If you came here to-night with the notion that by pleading with me you could save Luke from the consequences of his crime, then get that notion out of your head, my dear, and save us both from a very painful interview. Luke de Mountford was not arrested by my orders: I am only an automaton of the law, which takes its own course, without any personal interference on my part. Officially I--as an automaton--did just as duty and the law of this country directs. Personally, I sent through your father some sound advice to Luke de Mountford." ...|$|E
5000|$|It {{would be}} {{difficult}} to overstate how different the attitudes and assumptions about four-mallet marimba playing were at the time that MOM was written. Since I had been doing an independent roll from the moment I began playing xylophone in 1969, <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> <b>had</b> no appreciation of how [...] "revolutionary" [...] the technique was, but as late as 1976, when I performed at the first Percussive Arts Society International Convention, most percussionists were seeing the independent roll, my [...] "vertical Musser grip", rotary-based strokes and my extended-length birch handles for the first time.

Kittredge is a fan of film noir, classic pulp novels, and comic books. She describes herself as [...] "a skeptical believer in the Something Else. There's too much strange in this world for me to totally discount the possibility of Something Else being out there. But at the same time, I'm the first person to try and debunk any supernatural stuff that people claim is going on around them. <b>I,</b> <b>personally,</b> <b>had</b> one completely terrifying encounter with something supernatural that I still can't explain…hence my lack of 100% skepticism." ...|$|R
40|$|On the 13 th of this month, I {{was on my}} way to the new Bangkok airport {{after having}} participated in a UNESCO retreat in the {{outskirt}} of the city. The people who were with me had a travel advisory to go straight home after office. It did not sound like a very comfortable message but the ride to the airport was smooth and peaceful. Still, an outsider would have found such travel advisories and media coverage unsettling although the situation in the city was not what it seemed. <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> <b>had</b> a hard time convincing others that it was only a section of the city that was under siege. By and large, it was business as usual in Bangkok...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is the concept of {{cleanliness}} among the Mari, a people speaking a Finno-Ugrian language living in the Volga region of Russia. <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> <b>had</b> a chance to carry out ethnological expeditions in the Mari Republic and in the Mari villages of the Bashkir, Tatar and Udmurtian Republics, and the Kirov and Perm regions from 1981 until recently. In this article, I discuss the concept of hygiene among Mari women and the changes it went through from the Soviet times until today. I explore cleanliness discourse and practice as a traditional moral concept, and as a concept of hygiene adapted by Soviet mass culture. How has the propaganda of health and hygiene influenced the practices of everyday life? What was the connection between the traditional concept and the propaganda of power...|$|R

However, mid-way through the season it was {{announced}} that Röhm wanted to depart the series. Röhm said to MSNBC, [...] "If I had stayed, I don’t think it would have made much sense, and as much as I loved the show <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> <b>had</b> to kind of kick myself out of the crib." [...] she continued, [...] "It was very hard for me to make the decision because my managers and agents wanted me to not even do any of this season."

5000|$|Madraiwiwi {{says that}} ethnic Fijians really {{have nothing to}} fear from the large Indo-Fijian population, as native {{ownership}} of most of the land is enshrined in the Constitution. Madraiwiwi has called for a national discussion on adopting an inclusive label for all Fijian citizens. He pointed out that the Fijian label is very often taken to mean the Fijian ethnic group, rather than the citizenry as a whole. [...] "While <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> <b>have</b> no problem with the term Fijian, I recognise many others in my community are not," [...] he said {{in a speech to the}} Lautoka Rotary Club on 14 March 2005.

It's {{something}} <b>I,</b> <b>personally,</b> <b>have</b> never heard in rock music. What's interesting is the song sounds like it's in four, but it's in three. The harmonies and the way I'm playing the piano music are actually incredibly simple - sort of like [...] "Chopsticks" [...] simple - with this really weird rhythm. At the end we said, 'Oh, wouldn't it be cool if we had a horn fanfare?' so Padma Newsome wrote this very Steve Reichian minimalist horn fanfare." ...|$|E

[...] In Allison Danzig's book, [...] "The History of American Football," [...] Stagg said: [...] "I have seen statements giving credit to certain people originating the forward pass. [...] The fact is that all coaches were working on it. [...] The first season, 1906, <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> <b>had</b> sixty-four different forward pass patterns." [...] In 1954, Stagg told a reporter, [...] "Eddie Cochems, who coached at St. Louis University in 1906, also claimed to have invented the pass {{as we know it}} today ... It isn't so, because after the forward pass was legalized in 1906, most of the schools commenced experimenting with it and nearly all used it." [...] Stagg asserted that, as far back as 1894, before the rules committee even considered the forward pass, one of his players used to throw the ball [...] "like a baseball pitcher." ...|$|R
5000|$|I felt partly {{responsible}} because the Who recording schedule had, as usual, dragged on and on, sweeping all {{individuals and their}} needs aside. Glyn worked harder on The Who by Numbers than I've ever seen him. He had to, not because the tracks were weak or the music poor but because the group was so useless. We played cricket between takes or went to the pub. <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> <b>had</b> never done that before. I felt detached from my own songs, from the whole record.Recording the album seemed to take me nowhere. Roger Daltrey was angry with {{the world at the}} time. Keith Moon seemed as impetuous as ever, on the wagon one minute, off the next.
