5|$|At times, Beecher's has {{encountered}} challenges in maintaining this uniform standard. For example, when flooding affected one farm, the cows there produced enzymes in their milk that helped their calves {{to fight off}} bacteria, but changed the <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> milk.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most artisan cheese makers, Beecher's mainly uses {{pasteurized milk}} and {{operates}} a high-volume modern production facility, with multiple farms supplying milk. When Beecher's encountered problems in guaranteeing the standard <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> milks {{they were using}} to make cheese, the company bought their own herds of dairy cattle and farms to ensure control of the cheese products from beginning to end. Beecher's uses various cheese cultures when mixing cheeses, so a cheddar cheese produced by Beecher's may use cultures not normally intended for cheddar cheese production.|$|E

5|$|Le Guide Culinaire deemphasized the use {{of heavy}} sauces and leaned toward lighter fumets, which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables. This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose {{function}} is {{to add to the}} <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dish, rather than mask flavors like the heavy sauces and ornate garnishes of the past. Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal recipes in addition to recipes from Carême, Dubois and ideas from Taillevent's Viander, which had a modern version published in 1897. A second source for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of haute cuisine.|$|E
5|$|After {{competing}} in a bat'leth tournament {{on the planet}} Forcas III, Lieutenant Worf returns to the Enterprise and is treated to a surprise birthday party, much to his annoyance. As he attends the party, he starts to notice subtle changes, such as the <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cake changing, and a painting {{given to him by}} Data appearing on a different wall. The changes start to become more pronounced; as a Cardassian vessel attacks the Enterprise, unfamiliar controls result in Worf failing to raise the shields, leading to the death of Geordi La Forge. Despite retaining his initial memories, Worf has no evidence that reality has changed, and his own personal logs support the stories given by the other crew members. Other major changes occur: Riker is Captain of the Enterprise in a reality wherein Picard was killed by the Borg, the Bajorans became the oppressors of the Cardassians and enemies of the Federation, Wesley Crusher is a lieutenant on the Enterprise, Alyssa Ogawa is the Chief Medical Officer, and Worf finds himself married to Deanna Troi.|$|E
5|$|The Cabernet Sauvignon grape {{itself is}} very small, {{with a thick}} skin, {{creating}} a high 1:12 ratio of seed (pip) to fruit (pulp). From these elements the high proportions of phenols and tannins can have a stark influence on the structure and <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wine—especially if the must is subjected to long periods of maceration (skin contact) before fermentation. In Bordeaux, the maceration period was traditionally three weeks, which gave the winemaking staff enough time to close down the estate after harvest to take a hunting holiday. The results of these long maceration periods are very tannic and flavorful wines that require years of aging. Wine producers that wish to make a wine more approachable {{within a couple of}} years will drastically reduce the maceration time to as a little as a few days. Following maceration, the Cabernet must can be fermented at high temperatures up to 30 °C (86 °F). The temperature of fermentation will {{play a role in the}} result, with deeper colors and more flavor components being extracted at higher temperatures while more fruit flavors are maintained at lower temperature. In Australia there has been experimentation with carbonic maceration to make softer, fruity Cabernet Sauvignon wines.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> use <b>of</b> oak {{in white}} wine has {{declined}} significantly {{in recent times}} when before the norm was traditionally 2–5 years in oak.

25|$|Since the {{ripening}} process {{was developed to}} imitate aged raw pu'er, many arguments surround the idea of whether aging ripened pu'er is desirable. Mostly, the issue rests on whether aging ripened pu'er will, better or worse, alter the <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tea.|$|E

25|$|The above {{principles}} can be {{used for}} pairing wines with Asian cuisine. Pair for the <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dish - whatever the 'main ingredient' may be - it is not the meat, seafood, or vegetables that stand out as the predominant flavor. Rather the true <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dish is determined by the cooking method (for example, the toasty flavors of a stir fry), the sauce (from curries to sweet-and-sour), the use of seasonings (such as ginger and coriander leaves to mask fishy tastes), or the blending of ingredients to for new flavors (as in sukiyaki or satay). Indeed, it may result from a combination of any of these elements. Also, note {{that in the case of}} an Asian meal, several dishes are served at the same time and are shared by everyone present. The wine chosen for such a meal has to be versatile.|$|E

25|$|Humidity : The {{higher the}} humidity, {{the faster the}} tea will age. Liquid water accumulating on tea may {{accelerate}} the aging process but can also cause the growth of mold or make the <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tea less desirable. 60–85% humidity is recommended. It is argued whether tea quality is adversely affected if it is subjected to highly fluctuating humidity levels.|$|E
25|$|Unlike more {{aromatic}} {{red wine}} varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese and Pinot noir, Tempranillo has a relatively neutral profile {{so it is}} often blended with other varieties, such as Grenache and Carignan (known in Rioja as Mazuelo), or aged for extended periods in oak where the wine easily takes on the <b>flavor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barrel. Varietal examples of Tempranillo usually exhibit flavors of plum and strawberries.|$|E
25|$|Slow-simmered stews {{with various}} {{ingredients}} are another common food staple in Ivory Coast.
