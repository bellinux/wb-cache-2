And I had been off on a bus and she went off on a plane {{to the other side of}} the world to work and I hadn’t seen her. But she was coming home after a few months to see me and she was meeting me there, at the edge of America. I went to the airport to pick her up and went down to the gates- it’s weird to think about the fact that you could go to the gates then. And I sat there and I waited for her to come.

This world, this life gives you everything and nothing at the same time and doesn’t exactly tell you how to deal with that. The truth is you have to hold them both. I didn’t know how to do that. How do you live with loving something and knowing you’re going to throw it away? I stood there and watched the sun go down and her plane landed and she came home and I kissed her.

40|$|When I {{began this}} process, I {{decided to write}} a new work that could break the pattern of musical theatre where many shows are driven by song and dance entertainment. Over {{the course of my}} {{education}} in musical theatre, I have found it difficult to find musicals that have substance to them; in both character and plot, many of the shows of this genre of performance are lacking, for lack of better word. FRAMED started out from an Art History Class I was lucky enough to take in London. I was inspired to see paintings in a different way, and realized how much I enjoyed this newfound personal perspective. <b>I</b> then <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> could contribute to my craft by making some of the best known masterpieces come to life with the voices of my perspective. I think we all have become a little used to appreciating art from the perspective of others; we are often told what to see when we look at new works. FRAMED is my attempt to change this pattern, and to instill a sense of personal perspective when you look at any work of art, whether it is paintings, sculptures, literature, film or theatre. What's far more interesting than what the artist intended is what you see, and many people forget that step. So, I invite you to see this workshop, and interpret as you will. Please note that we are very early in development, and this is solely intended to allow my writings to get heard, over a performance that is, for lack of better word, picture perfect.

40|$|<b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> this {{reflection}} on my experiences could help other nurses {{who feel they}} have an idea that may {{make a difference to}} their practice or to patient experience, yet are hesitant to act on it. During my career I have often spoken out for what I or other Royal College of Nursing (RCN) members believe {{is the right thing to}} do, and always reflect to ensure that my actions are underpinned by positive intent and consideration of the greater good. Some might see this as leadership in action. In many arenas of care provision, we can be influenced by the latest trends. Recently the buzz words of ‘integrated care’, ‘prudent healthcare’ or ‘co-production’ are being applied to ‘cross-professional boundary working’, or ‘working in professional silos’. I would like this reflection to show how these buzz words can really lead to positive action and win-win outcomes. An area I am most passionate about is enabling carers to have the opportunity to sustain as ‘normal’ a family life as possible while meeting the daily needs of those they care for. To realise this, I believe it is necessary for nurses to think outside our usual arena of care provision. I was passionately reminded about this at a conference about 12 months ago. At this conference, I spoke informally with representatives of a carers’ support group, who told me about the problems they had maintaining any personal quality of life. Their daily routines were wholly focused on the care they afforded to the person they were responsible for. They had no real personal time, insufficient respite, no time for a career or to gain employment, few if any holidays and certainly no idea how long their work at home would continue or how their future life would unfold. Some of the complex care needs they were dealing with surprised me and my thoughts turned to ways in which nurses or nursing could contribute. ...|$|R

60|$|An {{imbecile}} habit {{has arisen}} in modern controversy {{of saying that}} such and such a creed can be held in one age but cannot be held in another. Some dogma, we are told, was credible in the twelfth century, but is not credible in the twentieth. You might as well say that a certain philosophy can be believed on Mondays, but cannot be believed on Tuesdays. You might as well say of {{a view of the}} cosmos that it was suitable to half-past three, but not suitable to half-past four. What a man can believe depends upon his philosophy, not upon the clock or the century. If a man believes in unalterable natural law, he cannot believe in any miracle in any age. If a man believes in a will behind law, he can believe in any miracle in any age. Suppose, for the sake of argument, we are concerned with a case of thaumaturgic healing. A materialist of the twelfth century could not believe it any more than a materialist of the twentieth century. But a Christian Scientist of the twentieth century can believe it as much as a Christian of the twelfth century. It is simply a matter of a man's theory of things. Therefore in dealing with any historical answer, the point is not whether it was given in our time, but whether it was given in answer to our question. And the more <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> when and <b>how</b> Christianity had come into the world, the more I felt that it had actually come to answer this question.|$|R
40|$|I was {{beginning}} {{the second year}} of a new job as head of marketing at Peacocks, a national fashion clothing retailer based in Cardiff, when I received a leaflet in the post announcing a new course at a nearby university - a 'Guided Doctorate in Organisational Leadership and Change [...] . a programme for senior managers who wish to pursue research into their practice in their own organisations'. This sounded interesting and could help me to understand the dynamics of my new position with my identity. <b>I</b> had previously <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> had worked within the structure and culture of the organisations I had been employed by. As new senior positions in new organisations reflected my career growth, I became increasingly conscious of my identity (Adams 2007) at work and wondered how leadership (Yukl 1998) contributed to my practice, if at all. As I later found out, the course was part of an emerging trend of practitioner doctorates where senior executives undertook doctoral research in their own organisations (Coghlan 2007). This approach could provide the answers to some searching questions that were already concerning me in my new job. I found the organisational culture (Schein 1997) and management style (Handy 1993) at Peacocks to be very different to anything I had previously experienced. I had even wondered whether they really needed the 'experienced retail marketer with an MBA' that the Sunday Times advertisement had stipulated. I experienced a period of uncertainty in how I felt my colleagues perceived me and my performance that led me to question my practice. The organisational setting was somewhat unusual and I was the 'new boy', one that was not adept at playing politics (Hope 2010), an activity that I increasingly felt clashed with my values (Michie & Gooty 2005) of trust, fairness and honesty (Burns 1978). Despite these concerns, I was resolved to continue working at Peacocks and to attempt to make the changes to the organisation that I considered were necessary. The Guided Doctorate course appealed to me as a way to contribute to my work and for me to understand, learn and create my practice as a leader. My research journey had begun.
