The reserve capital had to be at least a third (later half) of its stock capital and at least a third of it had to be invested in Russian government bonds or deposited with the State Bank of the Russian Empire. Investment income from Russian government bonds and 5% of annual profit were transferred to this reserve capital. From 1883, newly issued shares were required to be sold at a premium over the nominal face value to build up the reserve. The bank achieved the required reserve level (4.8 million rubles) in 1904. From 1899, the bank had a second special reserve to cover investment losses. Due to requirements of keeping capital invested (mostly stocks of railway companies and Russian government bonds), the bank suffered significant losses (10.4 million rubles) in 1900–1905.|$|E

According to the same project, implement it significantly reduces the <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>mortgage</b> loans, approximating its value to a rental.

50|$|An {{indirect}} method, {{known as}} the Smith Manoeuvre, for making <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>mortgage</b> for personal residence tax deductible in Canada is through an asset swap, whereby the homebuyer sells his existing investments, purchases a house in full or {{in part by the}} sale, gets a mortgage on the house, and finally, buys back his investments with the money from the mortgage. The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled in 2001 in the Singleton v. Canada case that transactions in the asset swap are to be regarded as distinct, thus rendering the interest on home mortgage acquired as part of the asset swap tax deductible.|$|E

40|$|This study empirically {{investigates the}} inflation-economic growth {{relationship}} {{to determine whether}} a threshold effect exists and if so to estimate the optimal inflation level which is conducive for economic growth in Namibia. With this view, various tables and charts, correlation matrices, pair-wise Granger Causality tests and a quadratic regression equation was estimated by OLS. Time series annual data covering a sample period from 1980 to 2012 were used in the estimation process. Stationarity tests on the variables revealed that all variables are stationary in levels. While the Granger Causality test revealed that there is a two-way causality between economic growth and inflation. A quadratic equation by OLS estimated generated a threshold level of inflation to be at 12. 0 per cent, which is conducive for economic growth in Namibia. The implication is that any inflation above this optimal level seems to affect economic growth negatively.
