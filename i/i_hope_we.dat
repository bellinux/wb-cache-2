500|$|On October 20, 1872, Briggs {{arrived at}} Pier 50 on the East River, New York City, to {{supervise}} the loading of the ship's cargo for Genoa: 1,701 barrels of poisonous denatured alcohol. A week later, Briggs was joined by his wife and baby daughter. On Sunday, November 3, Briggs wrote to his mother, telling her {{that he intended to}} leave on Tuesday, adding that, [...] "Our vessel is in beautiful trim and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> shall have a fine passage." ...|$|E
500|$|We {{found both}} {{her and her}} crew {{to be easy to}} work with and low-key. I think we would have {{expected}} a lot of drama, and the truth is, she is probably the most down-to-earth person. It was endearing. She was friendly and kind. ... I think, for us, we're so excited to have someone of her talent, and to have somebody like that shoot here is a sheer honor. What her music does for music is so much more than entertainment. It's connecting to the arts on a much deeper level, and that's what <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> can do here." ...|$|E
500|$|Tom Drynan {{was named}} Executive Director of the Brampton Public Library system in July 1993. In August that year, Drynan decided to evict the sculpture, {{after three years}} at the {{entrance}} of the art gallery at the Brampton Library branch. In a letter to community services commissioner Donald M. Gordon, Drynan wrote: [...] "I am sure that the statue has artistic merit and needs to be preserved. However, it is quite inappropriate in its present location within the newly renovated gallery. Its presence dominates any other exhibits which are placed in the area. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> can find a solution without having yet another tempest in a teapot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Or {{would have}} been, only that I {{intended}} something further.' Mr Broune had got {{himself into a}} difficulty and hardly {{knew how to get}} out of it. 'I was going on to say that <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>we</b> were not too old to--love.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's true," [...] said Babie! [...] "She can't expect it. Do you know, I am rather {{sorry we}} are not poorer? <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>we</b> should {{have to live in}} a very small way, and that I should have to work like you—-for mother." ...|$|R
5000|$|Accepting {{the global}} award, {{managing}} director, John Moriarty, said: “I am delighted {{to accept this}} award {{on behalf of all}} the people who work at the tannery. <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>we</b> might win the regional award for Africa, but I didn't dare dream that we might win the global award.” ...|$|R
500|$|Following {{the first}} race, Kurt Busch drove to victory lane. During the press conference, Busch said, [...] "To be in those positions, {{you have to}} have a good {{drafting}} partner. I had that with Regan Smith , had it with [...] McMurray on Saturday night [...] But you can't be in those positions if you don't build a great race car." [...] Also by winning the race, Kurt Busch would be the leader at the start of the Daytona 500, after Earnhardt was involved in an accident. Second-place finisher Smith stated: [...] "Kurt (Busch) and I worked good all day and we had good cars hooked up together. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> find each other and do the same thing on Sunday." [...] The first event took 58 minutes and 12 seconds to complete and the margin of victory was 0.065 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Around midday, Rupert {{was joined}} on Marston Moor by Newcastle, {{accompanied}} by a mounted troop of [...] "gentleman volunteers" [...] only. Rupert greeted him by saying, [...] "My Lord, I wish you had come sooner with your forces, but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> shall yet have a glorious day." [...] Newcastle counselled that the three allied armies, with separate garrisons, recruiting areas and lines of communication to protect, would eventually separate. He also suggested waiting for a force of 3,000 under Colonel Clavering and collected garrisons amounting to another 2,000 to join the Royalist army. Rupert was adamant that the King's letter (which he never showed to Newcastle) was a command to engage and defeat the enemy immediately. Furthermore, Rupert wished {{to compensate for the}} Royalists' numerical inferiority by catching the enemy unawares, and before further Parliamentarian reinforcements could increase their superiority in numbers.|$|E
500|$|Campling {{and other}} critics have commented {{that one of the}} main {{features}} of the show is the ability of the locals to laugh at themselves and their eccentricities. Campling wrote of the Skipton show: [...] "The ability to laugh at itself is one of this country's finest attributes, but the Skipton mob were only too happy to celebrate their insularity." [...] Elisabeth Mahoney of The Guardian, who reviewed the Dartford episode, said: [...] "Going to a place and insulting it takes guts and careful strategies. Steel made use {{of the fact that he}} is from nearby Swanley, both to signal that he knows the area but also that – whatever he was about to say about Dartford – it was better than his hometown." [...] Another journalist, reviewing the Penzance episode in the North Devon Journal commented: [...] "Why do we like programmes that laugh at us? Because, <b>I</b> <b>hope,</b> <b>we</b> laugh at ourselves. We're not ignorant of our stereotypes. West Cornwall? Aaarrrrr!" ...|$|E

500|$|In August 2015, Cornell openly said in {{interview}} with Total Guitar {{that he was}} quite eager to reunite with Audioslave: [...] "I {{think it would be}} great. We did a lot of songs, and with the benefit of not having done anything with those guys for so long, I can't imagine what it would be. It would be a really amazing experience just to get back and work with the same guys again." [...] Soon after, Morello said that he's interested in working with Cornell again, remembering their 2014 Seattle performance with great fondness: [...] "I love Chris and consider him a great friend. The Hall of Fame jam was nice, but a little chaotic. Playing with him in Seattle, that was just fantastic. I love that guy. He's one of the most talented vocalists in the history of vocalists. And {{to be able to play}} the songs that we wrote together, it was awesome and so much fun. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> do something like that again." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{a ten-year}} absence of nighttime-run stages, {{the first two}} Special Stages of the event were held on Thursday night. They were the first night stages {{scheduled}} in the rally since 1997. Throughout the day it had rained, and although it had stopped before the race began, the roads were still very wet and slippery. In discussing the day's weather, Grönholm said that he expected the stages that night to be difficult, and added, [...] "I hope this time we can take the right tyres, we were always {{a little bit on}} the wrong side – it’s not easy, but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> will manage to get it right this time." [...] Earlier in the day, the crews had driven a shakedown stage in Mauves; however, due to a large number of fans and spectators along the route the shakedown was stopped early, and some crews including Loeb and co-driver Daniel Elena were forced to carry out last-minute testing and necessary changes to their cars on the main roads back to Valence. Though forty-nine crews registered in the rally, only forty-seven actually competed. Privateers François Duval driving a , and Angelo Villa in a [...] failed to start the event.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{said of the}} episode: [...] "Buried Secrets" [...] left me {{wondering if}} there was even more to Megan's father's death than a simple suicide. There must be a story there and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> get to hear more of it. [...] It {{would be nice to}} see Megan get her answers, no matter what they may be". Orlando called Joan [...] "a real piece of work" [...] saying that she could not understand why Joan would not allow Megan to exhume her father's body. She added that Joan was [...] "cold" [...] saying this adding, [...] "I suddenly understood why Megan avoids Mom like the plague". Of the conversation between Samantha and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) she said, [...] "Ethan's story about losing his guinea pig as a child was sad and sweet. In his own strange way he was trying to relate to Samantha and the death of her friend. Plus, it painted a heart-breaking picture of a sad, lonely boy". She added that the death of the episode [...] "caused a ripple effect, touching everyone who came near it", including Kate, who she said that she admired Megan for exhuming the body, as [...] "she's not allowed to flaunt [...] the rules the way Megan is prone to do.|$|E

500|$|Johnson's move to Austin Aztex was {{finalised}} in March {{and completed}} their initial starting side, which included fellow English players Alex Tapp and Gifton Noel-Williams and Welshman Gareth Evans. Upon Johnson's transfer, team manager Adrian Heath said: [...] "I think it's {{fair to say}} that Eddie has lost his way recently and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> can get him back on the right path to where he is again one of the bright young players in English football." [...] Johnson played in the club's first game, which was a 2–0 friendly defeat to Major League Soccer's New England Revolution and scored in another pre-season match. Johnson scored his first goal for Austin on 25 April against fellow expansion side the Cleveland City Stars when he scored in the 13th minute of play. Johnson scored his second goal in the final minute of the match. In the 2009 season, Johnson played 22 league matches, scoring five goals making him the Aztex leading goalscorer, but he was forced to miss part of the season because of work permit problems after he returned to England with Evans. Johnson also played in two of the Aztex's three US Open Cup matches, playing in the first round, scoring the second goal in a 2–0 win over Mississippi Brilla and in Austin's 2–0 defeat to Houston Dynamo in the third round. The Austin Chronicle named Johnson the city's best player. The newspaper's citation said: [...] "he's been out there hustling every game and providing leadership and a steadying influence on and off the field. At 24, with a background that includes Manchester United and English national youth teams, he might not be with us much longer, but it's a treat while it lasts." [...] He went on to win one of the club's player of the season awards.|$|E
2500|$|London was the {{executive}} producer of Big Brooklyn Style, a reality show about customer experiences at Lee Lee's Valise boutique in New York. The show premiered May 29, 2012 on TLC. In February 2013, she became an Editor-at-Large of Shape magazine. In her role, she will write a fashion column for the magazine every month. In March 2013, TLC announced that What Not to Wear would air its final season starting in July. London said of the experience [...] "This show changed me and the trajectory of my life... <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> touched [...] as much as they touched me. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> touched our viewers." [...] In January 2015, TLC announced that London would host Love, Lust, or Run, a show similar to her previous work, What Not to Wear.|$|E
2500|$|Some day, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> shall {{know the}} real motives behind the mysterious conduct of the steel {{industry}} in this tragic incident.

2500|$|In April 2009, Corker criticized President Obama's Afghan war strategy, which boosted {{civilian}} {{efforts to}} rebuild the impoverished country and placed nuclear-armed Pakistan {{at the center of}} the fight: [...] "I have no idea what it is, other than sending additional troops. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> dig a lot deeper," [...] said Corker. He expected that the United States is having to build the economic and governmental structure of Afghanistan after decades of war.|$|E
2500|$|At the post-match press conference, losing captain Atherton {{said that}} [...] "It's a devastating defeat for me. I {{stressed}} before the Test {{the importance of}} not losing the first game... It can {{set the tone for}} the series", but emphasised his team's stomach for a fight, noting their recovery in the West Indies, saying: [...] "...we came back towards the end of the tour and won in Bridgetown.

2500|$|TLC aired {{the last}} episodes of What Not to Wear in Fall 2013. TLC general manager Amy Winter stated, [...] "After 10 {{incredible}} seasons, {{we felt that}} it was the right time to end the series." [...] Stacy London said, [...] "This show changed me and the trajectory of my life... I've learned so much from all of our contributors [...] over the years. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> touched them as much as they touched me. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> touched our viewers... I will always cherish the time I spent on 'WNTW' and be eternally grateful to TLC for a great co-host, amazing crew and an awesome program." [...] Clinton Kelly said, [...] "When I got the job, I told everyone I knew that we’d probably do 10 episodes, get canceled and I’d go crawling back to my old job in magazine publishing. So, I’m more surprised than anyone that we’ve lasted this long. At first I thought the essence of the show was making snarky remarks about people’s outfits, but as it turns out, 'WNTW' is about taking stock of who you are and communicating that non-verbally {{to the rest of the}} world. That’s incredibly empowering." ...|$|E
