40|$|The {{standard}} procedure to increase microfluidic chip performance is {{to grow the}} number of parallel test systems on the chip. This process is accompanied by miniaturizing biochemical workflows and micromechanical elements, which is often a major challenge for both engineering fields. In this work, we show {{that it is possible}} to substantially increase the runtime performance of a microfluidic affinity assay for protein interactions by simultaneously engineering <b>fluid</b> <b>logics</b> and assay chemistry. For this, synergistic effects between the micro- and chemical architecture of the chip are exploited. The presented strategy of reducing the runtime rather than size and volume of the mechanical elements and biological reagent compartments, will, in general, be of importance for future analytical test systems on microfluidic chips to overcome performance barriers...|$|R

These equations are then specialized to apply to a rigid vehicle with a constant amount of fluid contained in tanks and flowing through interconnecting lines. Various simplifications and specialized forms of the equations are derived, and relationships between mass and inertia that result from the <b>fluid</b> transfer <b>logic</b> and the physical constraints of the configuration are formulated. A tank arrangement and <b>fluid</b> transfer <b>logic</b> are devised which permit each vehicle product of inertia to be varied without varying the remaining elements of the inertia matrix or shifting the center of mass. Vehicle control is achieved by sensing angular rate and the local vertical and by transferring fluid as a function of these variables...|$|R
40|$|A brief {{historical}} {{analysis shows}} how Lhe development of pure <b>fluid</b> digital <b>logic</b> elements has followed a pattern. Attention was first centered on gain, then on reliability and lastly on speed. A conflict between gain and speed is now developing, {{and it appears}} that to resolve this coiflict, while preserving reliability, sacrifices in gain will need to be made. An element which makes more effective use of the control jet shows promise of providing a solution to the speed-gain dilemma. The UNIVAC inverter employs control jet reaction in order to reduce its dependence on wall attraction; however, the NASA contract to develop multi-state elements has shown the importance of reducing the effect of wall attraction still further.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Based on ethnographic {{fieldwork}} {{undertaken in}} the maternity unit of an urban Australian public hospital, this thesis explores metaphors derived from material density as major ordering principles in western understandings of the world, and argues that logics of solidity and fluidity underpin lines of contestation in scientific, academic, and biomedical/health discourses. Through an exploration of social and scientific understandings of the human body, the thesis argues that the body as a fluid, dynamic phenomenon is frequently understood, in biomedical culture, through a logic that is inherently ‘solid’. Solid logic is privileged over <b>fluid</b> <b>logic</b> in hospital environments, which has particular consequences for maternity and birthing care. While medicalised birthing has contributed to improvements in maternal and infant safety and well-being across the western world, inappropriately medicalised birth can be both traumatising and iatrogenic. Feminist contestations to the medicalisation of pregnancy and birth, and obstetric resistance to these contestations, {{can be seen as}} contestations between epistemologies centered on (more) fluid or (more) solid understandings of the world. Risk management is shown to be reliant on strategies of material and symbolic solidification, often {{to the detriment of the}} inherent fluidity of the maternal body. Constructions of individual autonomy rely on the construction of a bounded body that is often in contradiction with experienced biological corporeality. The thesis argues that <b>fluid</b> <b>logic</b> offers space for maternal corporeality, however the individual autonomy required by the western health consumer is only achievable within a framework of solid logic. Ethnographic engagement with pregnant and birthing women, their partners and families, midwives, obstetricians and other hospital professionals allows for an analysis of embodied and discursive beliefs and practices. The rich complexities of technologised birthing are highlighted in explorations of clinical encounters and key decision making moments in birthing and maternity care...|$|E
40|$|We propose fluid equivalences {{to compare}} and reduce {{behaviour}} of labeled fluid stochastic Petri nets (LFSPNs) while preserving their discrete and continuous properties. We define a linear-time relation of fluid trace equivalence and its branching-time counterpart, fluid bisimulation equivalence. Both fluid relations {{take into account}} the essential features of the LFSPNs behaviour: functional activity, stochastic timing and fluid flow. We consider the LFSPNs whose continuous markings have no influence to the discrete ones and whose discrete part is continuous time stochastic Petri nets. The underlying stochastic model for the discrete part of the LFSPNs is continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs). The performance analysis of the continuous part of LFSPNs is accomplished via the associated stochastic fluid models (SFMs). We show that fluid trace equivalence preserves average potential fluid change volume for the transition sequences of every certain length. We prove that fluid bisimulation equivalence preserves the aggregated probability functions: stationary probability mass for the underlying CTMC, as well as stationary fluid buffer empty probability, fluid density and distribution for the associated SFM. Hence, the equivalence guarantees identity of a number of discrete and continuous performance measures. Fluid bisimulation equivalence is then used to simplify the qualitative and quantitative analysis of LFSPNs via quotienting the discrete reachability graph and underlying CTMC. To describe the quotient associated SFM, the quotients of the probability functions are defined. We characterize logically fluid trace and bisimulation equivalences with two novel <b>fluid</b> modal <b>logics</b> $HML_{flt}$ and $HML_{flb}$, based on the Hennessy-Milner Logic HML. The application example of a document preparation system demonstrates the behavioural analysis via quotienting by fluid bisimulation equivalence...|$|R
40|$|Psychology is {{not alone}} in its {{struggle}} with conceptualizing the dynamic relationship between space and individual or collective identity. This general epistemological issue haunts biology where it has a specific focus in evolutionary arguments. It arises because of the incompatibility between definitive logical systems of 'contradiction or unity', which can only apply to inert material systems, and natural evolutionary processes of cumulative energetic transformation. This incompatibility makes any attempt to apply definitive logic to evolutionary change unrealistic and paradoxical. It is important to recognise, because discrete perceptions of self and group, based on the supposition that any distinguishable identity can be completely cut free, as an 'independent singleness', from the space it inescapably includes and is included in, are a profound but unnecessary source of psychological, social and environmental conflict. These perceptions underlie Darwin's definition of 'natural selection' as 'the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life'. They result in precedence being given to striving for homogeneous supremacy, through the competitive suppression of others, instead of seeking sustainable, co-creative evolutionary relationship in spatially and temporally heterogeneous communities. Here, I show how 'natural inclusion', a new, post-dialectic understanding of evolutionary process, becomes possible through recognising space as a limitless, indivisible, receptive (non-resistive) 'intangible presence' vital for movement and communication, not as empty distance between one tangible thing and another. The <b>fluid</b> boundary <b>logic</b> of natural inclusion as the co-creative, fluid dynamic transformation of all through all in receptive spatial context, allows all form to be understood as flow-form, distinctive but dynamically continuous, not singularly discrete. This simple move from regarding space and boundaries as sources of discontinuity and discrete definition to sources of continuity and dynamic distinction correspondingly enables self-identity to be understood as a dynamic inclusion of neighbourhood, through the inclusion of space throughout and beyond all natural figural forms as configurations of energy. Fully to appreciate and communicate the significance of this move, it is necessary to widen the linguistic, mathematical and imaginative remit of conventional scientific argument and explication so as to include more poetic, fluid and artistic forms of expression...|$|R
40|$|A new all-electronic Particle Image Velocimetry {{technique}} that can efficiently map high speed gas flows {{has been developed}} in-house at the NASA Lewis Research Center. Particle Image Velocimetry is an optical technique for measuring the instantaneous two component velocity field across a planar region of a seeded flow field. A pulsed laser light sheet is used to illuminate the seed particles entrained in the flow field at two instances in time. One or more charged coupled device (CCD) cameras {{can be used to}} record the instantaneous positions of particles. Using the time between light sheet pulses and determining either the individual particle displacements or the average displacement of particles over a small subregion of the recorded image enables the calculation of the <b>fluid</b> velocity. Fuzzy <b>logic</b> minimizes the required operator intervention in identifying particles and computing velocity. Using two cameras that have the same view of the illumination plane yields two single exposure image frames. Two competing techniques that yield unambiguous velocity vector direction information have been widely used for reducing the single-exposure, multiple image frame data: (1) cross-correlation and (2) particle tracking. Correlation techniques yield averaged velocity estimates over subregions of the flow, whereas particle tracking techniques give individual particle velocity estimates. For the correlation technique, the correlation peak corresponding to the average displacement of particles across the subregion must be identified. Noise on the images and particle dropout result in misidentification of the true correlation peak. The subsequent velocity vector maps contain spurious vectors where the displacement peaks have been improperly identified. Typically these spurious vectors are replaced by a weighted average of the neighboring vectors, thereby decreasing the independence of the measurements. In this work, fuzzy logic techniques are used to determine the true correlation displacement peak even when it is not the maximum peak, hence maximizing the information recovery from the correlation operation, maintaining the number of independent measurements, and minimizing the number of spurious velocity vectors. Correlation peaks are correctly identified in both high and low seed density cases. The correlation velocity vector map can then be used as a guide for the particle-tracking operation. Again fuzzy logic techniques are used, this time to identify the correct particle image pairings between exposures to determine particle displacements, and thus the velocity. Combining these two techniques makes use of the higher spatial resolution available from the particle tracking. Particle tracking alone may not be possible in the high seed density images typically required for achieving good results from the correlation technique. This two-staged velocimetric technique can measure particle velocities with high spatial resolution over a broad range of seeding densities...|$|R

The problem of positive identification of eluates has always existed in chromatography. A solution to this problem is to develop a highly selective and sensitive detection system which is able to provide detailed information regarding the chemical nature of a particular substance. Plasma atomic emission spectrometry provides one of the approaches. Because of the unique advantages of helium microwave induced plasmas (He-MIP) for nonmetal element selective detection, the development and application of the He-MIP as detector for supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC) {{is the subject of this}} study. A <b>fluid</b> <b>logic</b> solvent venting system was designed for GC-MIP. The results indicated that complete solvent removal from GC effluent was achieved. The operation of solvent venting had no effect on either plasma or chromatographic characteristics. The problems of plasma quenching and carbon deposition on the plasma torch due to the solvent elution were eliminated. Two approaches were taken to interface HPLC to the He-MIP. One system is based upon a moving wheel interface. With this system, halides and oxohalogen salts were determined. Detection limits were ranged from 4 to 300 ng/sec. The other approach was to utilize a Finnigan MAT HPLC-MS moving band interface and modify it for use as an HPLC-MIP interface. Organic samples were analyzed and the detection limits for chlorine ranged from 1. 88 to 3. 45 ng/sec. With the latter system, calibration plots were linear over 2 orders of magnitude. The interface of SFC and He-MIP was also studied. The near-infrared spectral region was chosen for chlorine and sulfur detection due to the molecular emission band interference in the UV-VIS spectrum region caused by CO 2 SFC mobile phase. An SFC-MIP interface was designed, and various parameters were evaluated in terms of system optimization. The detection limit was 40 pg/sec for chlorine and 120 pg/sec for sulfur. The linear dynamic ranges were over 3 orders of magnitude for both elements. Finally, future considerations are addressed...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the Water Crisis and Choices, ADB and Partners Conference, ADB HQ, Manila, Philippines, 11 - 15 October 2010 The authors were asked {{to answer the question}} ?small-scale irrigation: is this the future??. Taking as a starting point the analyses and of the IWMI-FAO-ADB study on Revitalizing Asia?s Irrigation and its key strategies, the paper compares atomistic irrigation, traditional small-scale and large-scale irrigation options, outcomes and potentials in their socio-economic and river basin environments. Atomistic irrigation has exploded, river basins are closing and energy prices are soaring. This new reality, its benefits, its sustainability crisis, but also the potential for new strategies that this phenomenon has demonstrated must first be acknowledged. In most countries and river basins, additional development of irrigation at whatever scale is not an option and the focus will be on improving the productivity and sustainability of existing systems. In areas where irrigation development is still possible, options remain open. Demography, market pull, water constraints and energy will largely determine the mix of atomistic, small-scale and large-scale irrigation and their evolution, expansion and decline over time. The paper explores tactics and strategies for the modernization of existing and the potential for new large-scale systems and for supporting and sustaining atomistic and small-scale irrigation, institutional and policy innovations, and tools to facilitate dynamic planning and management of the sector, the evolution of different systems and the design of measures to support an enabling environment. A considerable body of knowledge exists on how to support these strategies, transform large-scale irrigation systems and promote various forms of atomistic, small-scale and large-scale irrigation systems. Tools that support long-term sectoral planning and management for future investment and the design of measures to support an enabling environment are proposed. The deployment of sound water accounting and auditing systems will be critical. Planning and policy mechanisms will require looking outside the irrigation sector and this is often where effective interventions will be found. We need to move from competition and conflict between atomistic, small-scale and large-scale irrigation to a <b>fluid</b> <b>logic</b> of complementarily, combination and convergence. For this to happen, the virtual reality of official agency outlooks, imported frameworks, and descriptions of the sectors and the basins will often need to be reformed, as a preliminary to the reform of the institutions and programmes that embody them. Then, the mobilization of resources from the public sector, the private sector and water users can be greatly enhanced and result in positive outcomes and more sustainable results, and enable new solutions to old problems that have long nagged the sector. Changing the outlook of the sector and effecting the necessary structural and policy reforms, which are required to change decision-making on future investments in the sector will be difficult. Capacity building and changing practice and results on the ground, together with the adoption of robust monitoring and evaluation systems for investment and policy results, can serve as a basis for developing a broad constituency to effect the changes in governance and policy that will ultimately be needed, and assist in shaping investment to facilitate these changes...|$|E
