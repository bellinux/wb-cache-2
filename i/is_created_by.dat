5|$|The Matsya Purana tells a {{different}} story {{of the origin of}} Varahi. Varahi, with other Matrikas, <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> Shiva to help him kill the demon Andhakasura, who has the ability – like Raktabija – to regenerate from his dripping blood.|$|E
5|$|Acne scars {{are caused}} by {{inflammation}} within the dermal layer of skin and are estimated to affect 95% of people with acne vulgaris. The scar <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> abnormal healing following this dermal inflammation. Scarring {{is most likely to}} take place with severe acne, but may occur with any form of acne vulgaris. Acne scars are classified based on whether the abnormal healing response following dermal inflammation leads to excess collagen deposition or loss {{at the site of the}} acne lesion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the classic}} {{analysis}} by Edward Lorenz (the Lorenz Energy Cycle), extratropical cyclones (so-called atmospheric transients) {{acts as a}} mechanism in converting potential energy that <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> pole to equator temperature gradients to eddy kinetic energy. In the process, the pole-equator temperature gradient is reduced (i.e. energy is transported poleward to warm up the higher latitudes).|$|E

50|$|The worm is {{believed}} to have <b>been</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> Melbourne-based hackers, the first to <b>be</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> an Australian or Australians. The federal police of Melbourne thought the worm <b>was</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> two hackers who used the names Electron and Phoenix. Julian Assange was believed to be involved, but he does not acknowledge this.|$|R
5|$|Seasons {{may play}} a role in some regions. A {{dramatic}} change in colour and texture <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> seasonal snowy conditions in northern latitudes, necessitating repainting of vehicles and separate snow oversuits. The Eastern and northern European countries have a tradition for separate winter uniforms rather than oversuits. During the Second World War, the Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, as well as white winter oversuits.|$|E
5|$|The Copenhagen interpretation, Part II ("Reality <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> observation.") In this {{variation}} of the Copenhagen interpretation, associated with John Archibald Wheeler, the reality of quantum attributes is created {{in the act of}} observation, as illustrated by the example of Wheeler's delayed choice experiment.|$|E
5|$|The normal resting {{heart rate}} {{is called the}} sinus rhythm, created and {{sustained}} by the sinoatrial node, a group of pacemaking cells found in {{the wall of the}} right atrium. Cells in the sinoatrial node do this by creating an action potential. The cardiac action potential <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> the movement of specific electrolytes {{into and out of the}} pacemaker cells. The action potential then spreads to nearby cells.|$|E
50|$|The {{base of the}} {{counting}} system is ogún 'twenty' (or 'score'). There are words {{for each of the}} decades; units in 1-4 <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> adding to these, while units in 5-9 <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> subtracting from the next decade. The odd decades <b>are</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> subtracting ten from the next even decade, as in Danish.|$|R

5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E
5|$|At the Penitentiary, Quinn {{releases}} Poison Ivy {{from her}} cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production {{facility in the}} Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create an antidote and learns that {{it can only be}} made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment.|$|E
5|$|Ethnologists and anthropologists {{who study}} myths have {{developed}} various classification schemes {{for the various}} themes that appear in creation stories. For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a world egg; such stories include the Finnish epic poem Kalevala, the Chinese story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana. In related stories, the Universe <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi-Buddha, the ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), the Aztec goddess Coatlicue myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, and the Judeo-Christian Genesis creation narrative in which the Abrahamic God created the Universe. In another type of story, the Universe is created from the union {{of male and female}} deities, as in the Maori story of Rangi and Papa. In other stories, the Universe <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god— as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythology– or from chaotic materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology. In other stories, the Universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as Brahman and Prakrti, the creation myth of the Serers, or the yin and yang of the Tao.|$|E

5|$|Helium is {{the second}} lightest element and {{is the second}} most {{abundant}} in the observable universe. Most helium was formed during the Big Bang, but new helium is being created {{as a result of the}} nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars. On Earth, helium is relatively rare and <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> the natural decay of some radioactive elements because the alpha particles that are emitted consist of helium nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations of up to seven percent by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation.|$|E
5|$|Indium <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> the {{long-lasting}} (up {{to thousands}} of years) s-process (slow neutron capture) in low-to-medium-mass stars (which range in mass between 0.6 and 10 solar masses). When a silver-109 atom (the isotope that comprises approximately half of all silver in existence) catches a neutron, it undergoes a beta decay to become cadmium-110. Capturing further neutrons, it becomes cadmium-115, which decays to indium-115 by another beta decay. This explains why the radioactive isotope is more abundant than the stable one. The stable indium isotope, indium-113, {{is one of the}} p-nuclei, the origin of which is not fully understood; although indium-113 is known to be made directly in the s- and r-processes (rapid neutron capture), and also as the daughter of very long-lived cadmium-113, which has a half-life of about eight quadrillion years, this cannot account for all indium-113.|$|E
5|$|Niobium {{is used as}} a {{precious}} metal in commemorative coins, often with silver or gold. For example, Austria produced a series of silver niobium euro coins starting in 2003; the colour in these coins <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> the diffraction of light by a thin anodized oxide layer. In 2012, ten coins are available showing a broad variety of colours in the centre of the coin: blue, green, brown, purple, violet, or yellow. Two more examples are the 2004 Austrian €25 150 Years Semmering Alpine Railway commemorative coin, and the 2006 Austrian €25 European Satellite Navigation commemorative coin.|$|E

5|$|On Earth it is {{relatively}} rare—5.2 ppm by volume in the atmosphere. Most terrestrial helium present today <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as 7% by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation. Previously, terrestrial helium—a non-renewable resource, because once released into the atmosphere it readily escapes into space—was thought to be in increasingly short supply. However, recent studies suggest that helium produced deep in the earth by radioactive decay can collect in natural gas reserves in larger than expected quantities, in some cases having been released by volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|Shira Chess {{argues that}} the Slender Man exemplifies the {{similarities}} between traditional folklore and the open source ethos of the Internet, and that, unlike those of traditional monsters such as vampires and werewolves, {{the fact that the}} Slender Man's mythos can be tracked and signposted offers a powerful insight into how myth and folklore form. Chess identifies three aspects of the Slender Man mythos that tie it to folklore: collectivity (meaning that it <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> a collective, rather than a single individual), variability (meaning that the story changes depending on the teller), and performance (meaning that the storyteller's narrative changes to reflect the responses of his/her audience).|$|E
5|$|Sitting in Padmasana (lotus) posture, {{the text}} {{states that the}} pranayama or {{breathing}} must be gradual, both inhalation, holding and exhalation should be slow, steady and deep. The text introduces a series of time measures (matras, musical beats) to aid self monitoring and to measure progress, wherein the beat <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> the yoga student with fingers self circumambulating and using one's own knee for the beat pulse. A sequential gradual inhalation over sixteen Matras (digits), holding the air deep within for sixty-four Matras and gradually exhaling the air over thirty-two Matras is suggested as {{the goal of the}} breathing exercise.|$|E

5|$|The Song dynasty (960–1279) was an {{imperial}} dynasty of China that succeeded the period {{referred to as}} Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–960) and preceded the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), which conquered the Song dynasty in 1279. The conventional division into the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127) and Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279) <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> the conquest of northern China by the Jin dynasty (1115–1234) in 1127 and the consequent shift of the capital from Bianjing (present-day Kaifeng) in the north to Lin'an (present-day Hangzhou) in the south.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{a complex}} structure, containing external and internal components. It consists of the glans (including the frenulum of clitoris, which is a frenulum on the under-surface of the glans and <b>is</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> the two medial parts of the labia minora), the clitoral body (which is composed of two erectile bodies known as the corpora cavernosa), two clitoral crura, the clitoral hood (formed by the labia minora) and the vestibular or clitoral bulbs. The clitoral body is {{commonly referred to as}} the shaft (or internal shaft), while the length of the clitoris between the glans and the body may also be referred to as the shaft (or external shaft) because, like the shaft as a whole, it supports the glans, and its shape can be seen and felt through the clitoral hood.|$|E
