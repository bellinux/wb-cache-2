50|$|Sulfur tetrafluoride {{can be used}} {{to replace}} a variety of {{functional}} groups with partially or fully fluorinated derivatives. Liquid hydrogen fluoride {{can be used as a}} solvent and catalyst with SF4 to selectively <b>fluorinate</b> alcohols. SF4's reactivity with carbonyl compounds is not enhanced in the presence of HF. Generally, only relatively acidic alcohols can be fluorinated efficiently with SF4, although amino alcohols appear to be an exception to this rule.(5)When vicinal diols are combined with SF4, difluorination occurs with inversion of configuration at one of the alcohols. This was demonstrated in the synthesis of meso-difluorosuccinate from (L)-tartrate and the synthesis of (D)- and (L)-difluorosuccinate from meso-tartrate.(6)Carbonyl compounds generally react with SF4 to yield geminal difluorides. Reaction times tend to be on the order of hours and yields are moderate.(7)Fluorination of lactones can provide heterocyclic fluorides, although ring opening has been observed for γ-butyrolactone. The six-membered lactide does not experience ring opening.(8)Fluorination opens epoxides to give either geminal or vicinal difluorides in most cases. Monoarylepoxides give geminal products with migration of the aryl group. Yields are low for sterically hindered di- and trisubstituted epoxides. Epoxides substituted with an ester group give vicinal difluorides via an alkoxysulfur trifluoride intermediate.(9)When amines are treated with SF4 and a base, iminosulfur difluorides result. Further reaction of these compounds with alkali metal fluorides leads to nitrile sulfides, which undergo 3+2 cycloaddition in the presence of dipolarophiles.(10)Carboxylic acids react with SF4 to afford trifluoromethyl compounds through the intermediacy of an acyl fluoride. Tetrafluoroalkyl ethers also form via reaction between difluoromethyl cation and acyl fluoride.(11)Sulfur tetrafluoride {{can be used to}} <b>fluorinate</b> polymers efficiently. This often has a profound effect on polymer properties—fluorination of polyvinyl alcohol, for instance, improves its resistance to strong acids and bases.|$|E

50|$|Sulfur tetrafluoride is a gaseous reagent {{that may}} be used to <b>fluorinate</b> a variety of organic {{functional}} groups, including carbonyl compounds, alcohols, and halides. Treatment of carbonyl compounds generally converts them into organofluorides of equivalent oxidation state: carboxylic acids are converted to trifluoromethyl compounds, ketones and aldehydes to difluorides, etc. The reaction has broad scope {{and is one of the}} few methods available for the direct introduction of fluorine at a specific site under relatively mild conditions.(1)Fluorinations of alcohols and halides are also possible with SF4. However, SF4 is gaseous at room temperature, and many transformations involving this reagent require elevated temperatures, making handling somewhat difficult. In addition, SF4 is hydrolyzed into corrosive hydrogen fluoride, and is itself toxic. These concerns have led to the development of safer, more robust fluorinating reagents, such as DAST (diethylaminosulfur trifluoride).|$|E

40|$|AbstractDue to good {{reactivity}} of <b>fluorinated</b> (meth) acrylates with other monomers or polymer segments, <b>fluorinated</b> poly(meth) acrylates possess more economical and convenient synthesis routes than other fluoropolymers. This feature article initially summarizes {{different types of}} <b>fluorinated</b> (meth) acrylates, which {{can be divided into}} <b>fluorinated</b> alkyl (meth) acrylates and <b>fluorinated</b> aryl (meth) acrylates.
