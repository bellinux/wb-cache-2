5000|$|Ford {{completely}} redesigned {{both the}} B-Series and medium-duty F-Series and departed {{from using the}} same grilles as the lighter duty F-Series trucks. The new buses were taller and wider with a large grille utilizing much of {{the space of the}} front fascia. The new grille was rectangular with the single headlights being placed very near the far ends of the grille. The fenders were even more flared than before to allow for a wider track and larger wheels and tires needed to make the necessary gain in GVW to remain competitive. This generation was also the first to receive the option of a diesel engine in place of the strictly gasoline lineup in the past. An extra [...] "0" [...] was added to the series notation on diesel models. After 1968, the Mercury-branded version of the B-Series was discontinued in the Canadian market. For 1973, the grille was updated with longer teardrops around the headlights and <b>F</b> <b>O</b> <b>R</b> D block lettering appeared {{on the front of the}} hood just above the grille.|$|E
5000|$|For 1978, the {{appearance}} of the F-Series changed the most since 1972, when the split grille was overhauled in favor of a single-piece grille insert design. Much larger than before, the grille no longer incorporated the headlights, turn signals or the [...] " [...] <b>F</b> <b>O</b> <b>R</b> D" [...] letters. The headlights were located in housings beside the grille, and the park/turn signal lamps were located below them. Additionally, a new chrome-plated letter set reading [...] "F O R D" [...] could now be seen on the hood immediately above the grille. In 1977 (1978 models), the round headlight design was retained for the Custom trim level. A luxury [...] "Lariat" [...] trim was also introduced for 1978; Ranger, Ranger XLT, and Ranger Lariat trim levels incorporated rectangular headlights with optional chrome headlight bezels and the chrome grille insert. Dual Fuel tanks in the bed became standard. For 1979, round headlights were replaced by rectangular ones on all trim levels, and the surrounding grille insert that framed the headlights was now available in either black or chrome to match that of the aluminum grille frame. Also new for 1978 was the option of part- or full-time four-wheel-drive on SuperCab models. Full-time four-wheel drive utilized a chain-driven NP203 transfer case, while part-time four-wheel drive was equipped with a gear-driven NP205.|$|E
