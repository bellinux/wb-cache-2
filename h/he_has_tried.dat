50|$|The journal {{for which}} he became known {{was not the first}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> to keep; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> to write one at age 17 to chronicle a romantic relationship, but {{abandoned}} it after losing interest in the project.|$|R

25|$|Fifteen years later, the Pevensie {{children}} have grown into {{young men and}} women. While chasing a white stag through the forest, they encounter the lamppost that Lucy saw on her first trip to Narnia. They make their way through trees, suddenly tumbling out of the wardrobe {{at the same time}} and day they left, becoming children again. Lucy later attempts to return to Narnia via the wardrobe, but Professor Kirke tells her <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> for many years, and they will probably return to Narnia when they least expect it.|$|E
25|$|Sympathizers {{consider}} that Uribe had achieved significant {{results in the}} fight against illegal armed groups, allowing civilian traffic to return to many roads abandoned during the 1990s. They believe <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> to implement macroeconomic measures to stimulate internal commerce, growth and reduce unemployment, although he has not passed important bills such as a structural tax reform. However, after his term was over, his closer advisors, among which: his personal secretary, two ministers, among others, were either in prison or pursued by justice as a consequence of illegal activities, and former president is currently being investigated for several issues.|$|E

25|$|Part of Lee's {{difficulty}} at Test {{level is}} {{that the benefits of}} his high speed, which give the batsmen less reaction time, also results in more erratic bowling. In recent times <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> to concentrate solely on accuracy by reducing speed. During the first Test against the West Indies in late 2005 at the Gabba, after declaring that he would sacrifice pace and focus on 'line and length', Lee reverted to his initial style of bowling, based on the advice of his captain Ricky Ponting after his new method of bowling failed in the first innings. This saw him take 5/30 his fifth five-wicket haul in Tests, his first in four years.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 A Network {{documentary}} Jose Canseco: Last Shot chronicles Canseco's {{attempts to}} end his steroid use.

Since, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> unsuccessfully to reach out to former Bash Brother Mark McGwire and other ex-teammates. In 2014, he returned to the Oakland coliseum {{to take part in the}} reunion celebrating the 25th anniversary of the 1989 World Series championship team, this marked the first time Canseco took part in an official Major League event in almost 13 years. Mark McGwire, at the time coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers, did not attend the event.|$|E
500|$|David is an observant Orthodox Jewish doctor from Los Angeles who {{has spent}} a decade trying to {{reconcile}} his homosexuality with Judaism. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> numerous forms of [...] "treatment", from eating figs and praying to wearing a rubber band on his wrist to flick whenever he thinks of men, but to no avail.

500|$|Dinklage played Trumpkin in the 2008 film [...] The {{movie was}} a box office disappointment, with global {{revenues}} of $419.7 million, although film critic Bill Gibron described Dinklage's {{role as a}} [...] "cutesy stereotype <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> to avoid". Later that year, he played the title role in Uncle Vanya (directed by his wife, Erica Schmidt) in Bard College's annual Bard SummerScape, the Upstate New York summer stage on the Annandale-on-Hudson campus. [...] In 2010, he appeared in the Australian movie I Love You Too alongside Brendan Cowell and Peter Helliar.|$|E
500|$|Danish Muslim {{politician}} Naser Khader said, [...] "Muslims {{are no more}} {{discriminated against}} in Denmark than they are elsewhere in Europe... Generally, Danes give you a fair shake. They accept Muslims if you declare that you are loyal to this society, to democracy. If {{you say that you}} are one of them, they will accept you. If you have reservations, they will worry." [...] His concern has centred on the power of [...] "Islamism" [...] or fundamentalist political Islam in Denmark's Muslim community which <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> to fight, especially {{in the wake of the}} controversy by forming an association of democratic, moderate Muslims.|$|E
500|$|As {{the end of}} {{the year}} approaches, Boon Hock excels in the PSLE Mathematics exam, while the other boys manage to scrape by [...] Kok Pin only marginally. Contrary to Kok Pin's fears, his mother is {{satisfied}} because <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> his best. When visiting Mrs. Liu at the hospital, the EM3 teacher announces that one of Kok Pin's drawings won second prize in an international competition, but the moment is overshadowed by the rush to save Mrs. Liu's life. Mr. Khoo passes the transplant test, but refuses to donate after discovering the intended recipient is his enemy's wife. He eventually relents, but it is revealed that due to a mix-up Terry, not Mr. Khoo, is the suitable donor. Despite protests from his parents, he insists on undergoing the operation, which is a success. A grateful Mr. Liu offers to help Mr. Khoo's business with his proposal. As a result, Mr. Khoo's business booms, and the two enemies become good friends. [...] The film ends with Terry being bullied again, as in the beginning of the movie [...] but this time, he stands up for himself and fights back.|$|E

500|$|Janssen {{said the}} film is [...] "definitely played {{with a bit of}} a wink and doesn't take itself too seriously." [...] Wirkola himself {{described}} it as [...] "a little more grounded" [...] and action-centered than Dead Snow. He recalled that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> to downplay comedy elements: [...] "If you go too far, it can turn into a spoof almost...We shot a lot more than what is in the movie of course and it’s just balancing it when you’re cutting." [...] Speaking of graphic violence, he said that [...] "the first version we tested was for sure the most extreme. Some stuff stayed in, some stuff got cut out." [...] By August 2012, Paramount was reportedly test screening two versions of the film, rated R and PG-13, and the R-rated cut received the positive feedback. Wirkola said, [...] "I was afraid. I actually made sure they could never cut it to PG-13...We always {{knew it was going to}} be R." [...] McKay said that Paramount's Adam Goodman [...] "was perceptive enough to see the same thing and got behind it as well." [...] Wirkola said, [...] "The pre-production and shooting went very smooth, but the post-production was very new to me and how they do things here with testing and the studio." [...] He said about the test screenings in particular: [...] "I can see why they do it – there’s a lot of money involved and they want it to hit as broad as possible. But I think it’s a flawed process, I really do." [...] McKay said that Paramount executives might nevertheless regret the film's R rating.|$|E
2500|$|When Socrates {{is nearly}} done, Dionysus, {{who is to}} judge the speeches, arrives, {{in the person of}} Alcibiades.

2500|$|Crawford {{was born}} in Manchester, England in 1908 and arrived in Australia in 1924. As a playwright, Crawford was {{influenced}} by William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe. He was also greatly influenced by the Communist Party of Australia and the ideals it stood for. In an article written by Crawford about Elizabethan Theatre he wrote that [...] "In the Elizabethan Theatre, Marlowe spoke with {{the voice of the}} radical intellectual. Shakespeare spoke with the voice of the people." [...] From the themes of the plays written by Crawford it is clear <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> to emulate both Marlowe and Shakespeare.|$|E

As a former saxophonist, he has said that being a musician was a profoundly influential experience that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> to reproduce in his poetry. The musicality of poetry was and is extremely important to his work. Additionally, Pinsky revealed in a 1999 interview with Bomb Magazine that he enjoys jazz for its [...] "physical immediacy, improvisation and also the sense that a lifetime of suffering and study and thought and emotion is behind some single phrase." ...|$|E
