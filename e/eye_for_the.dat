5|$|Queer <b>Eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Straight Guy debuted during 2003, {{and quickly}} became a {{surprise}} success. The success of the series resulted in merchandising, franchising of the concept internationally, and a woman-oriented spin-off, Queer <b>Eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Straight Girl. Queer Eye won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program during 2004. The series' name was abbreviated to Queer Eye {{at the beginning of}} its third season to represent the show's change from making over only heterosexual men to including women and homosexual men. Queer Eye ended production during 2006 June and the final ten episodes were broadcast during October 2007. The series ended October 30. During September 2008, the Fine Living Network briefly aired Queer Eye in syndication.|$|E

5|$|In 1910 Brooks had {{her first}} solo show at the prestigious Gallery Durand-Ruel, {{displaying}} thirteen paintings, almost all of women or young girls. Some were portraits; others showed anonymous models in interior scenes or against tonal backgrounds, often with pensive or withdrawn expressions. The paintings were generally naturalistic, showing an attentive <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> details of Belle Époque fashion, with parasols, veils, and elaborate bonnets on display.|$|E
5|$|Queer Eye is an American reality {{television}} series that premiered {{on the cable}} television network Bravo during July 2003. The program's original name Queer <b>Eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Straight Guy was changed after the third season to generalize the scope of its content. The series was created by executive producers David Collins and Michael Williams along with their producing partner David Metzler; it was produced by their production company, Scout Productions.|$|E

5|$|The hostage-takers {{and their}} cause were largely {{forgotten}} after the Iran–Iraq War broke {{out later that}} year and the hostage crisis in Tehran continued until January 1981. Nonetheless, the operation brought the SAS to the public <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time and bolstered the reputation of Thatcher. The SAS was quickly overwhelmed {{by the number of}} applications it received from people inspired by the operation and experienced greater demand for its expertise from foreign governments. The building, having suffered major damage from a fire that broke out during the assault, was not reopened as the Iranian embassy until 1993.|$|E

His final such appearance was on the 30th anniversary show, on January 14, 1982.|$|E
25|$|The {{works of}} Martial became highly valued on their {{discovery}} by the Renaissance, whose writers often {{saw them as}} sharing an <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> urban vices of their own times. The poet's influence is seen in Juvenal, late classical literature, the Carolingian revival, the Renaissance in France and Italy, the Siglo de Oro, and early modern English and German poetry, until {{with the growth of}} the Romantic movement he became unfashionable.|$|E
25|$|In 1922 Mowinckel staged an {{adaptation}} of Wedekind's play Spring Awakening at Intimteatret. The performance was well received by the public, with standing ovations. This {{was the first time}} Munch's paintings were used at a Norwegian stage. In a retrospective article from 1939 Anton Rønneberg characterized this event as an important day in the history of Norwegian theatre. He pointed at her artistic <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> stage setting, and for the harmony between stage decorations, costumes, light and choreography.|$|E

25|$|The {{creation}} of Austria-Hungary and the Banat's absorption into the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen were significant blows for Mocioni's nationalist-loyalist campaign. Mocioni withdrew to Foeni, ailing {{and out of}} the public <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> final decade of his life. He was still a noted philanthropist and sponsor of the Romanian press, but had conflicts with Krassó County voters and the Romanian peasants on his estates, a matter which contributed to his voluntary isolation. He was survived by his wife Laura, daughter of Petar Čarnojević, and by his nephew, the politician Alexandru Mocioni.|$|E
25|$|Congress did {{not deal}} with the problem of what to do if a President were alive but {{incapacitated}} as Garfield was. Nor did the Congress take up the question 38 years later, when Woodrow Wilson suffered a stroke that put him in a coma for days and left him partially paralyzed and blind in one <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{last year and a half}} of his Presidency. It was not until the Twenty-fifth Amendment was ratified in 1967 that there was an official procedure for what to do if the president became incapacitated.|$|E
25|$|The Fifth Dalai Lama's Regent or Desi, Sonam Rapten was, in fact, a fanatical Gelugpa {{supremacist}} {{as well as}} {{a shrewd}} and canny political operator with an <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> main chance. Being 22 years the Dalai Lama's senior he dominated him as he raised him from the age of 5. In his autobiography The Dukula the lama repeatedly remarks how he had to defer to the Desi, or had to do as he said, and even as an adult he rarely got his way if he disagreed with Sonam Rapten's wishes.|$|E

25|$|However, on {{the return}} journey from Chesterfield a horrible {{accident}} occurred when the car in which Bakewell and teammate Reggie Northway were travelling flipped over. Northway was killed and Bakewell's right arm was so badly damaged that, despite considerable efforts at rehabilitating this arm through extremely specialised treatment (involving electric shocks designed to restore consciousness) during 1937 and 1938, he {{was never able to}} play cricket again, although hopes for his recovery existed as late as 1939. Indeed, he vanished completely from the public <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of his life.|$|E
25|$|By 1962 he {{had become}} a captain. That year brought him into the public <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time, {{although}} rather harshly. Two officers who had responded to a robbery in progress at the Borough Park Tobacco Company in Brooklyn, where Seedman worked at the time, were killed. That {{was the first time that}} had happened to a pair of NYPD officers in 30 years. When one of the suspects, Tony Dellernia, who had surrendered in Chicago and was extradited to New York, Seedman, as was customary, had him perp-walked in front of reporters outside the precinct house.|$|E
25|$|Mkhitaryan is an attacking midfielder, {{who is also}} {{capable of}} playing as a second striker or as a winger. He excels playing in a central role, just behind the strikers, where he often looks to link up with his {{teammates}} {{in and around the}} penalty area. He is known for his ability to draw away opposing defenders and, in turn, create space for his teammates to exploit, leading to goal scoring opportunities, courtesy of his offensive movement, technique, and vision. Mkhitaryan has also been praised for his precise passing, dribbling ability, creativity, ball control and work rate, as well as his <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> final pass; his skill and trickery on the ball enables him to beat defenders in one on one situations. Furthermore, he possesses an accurate shot.|$|E
