This article summarises a research study that was commissioned by the Australian international trade and transport industry. The research study reviews the various types of ‘Accredited Operator ’ (AO) schemes that are currently in use or being implemented and identifies options for their application in Australia. In doing so, it has sought the views of industry and has focused on ways to maximise the relevance of such schemes, minimise compliance costs and ensure against the possible erosion of Australian industry’s competitive position in the global marketplace.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Securing the nation's borders has taken on added importance since {{the terrorist attacks of}} September 11, 2001. For years, millions of citizens of the United States, Canada, and Bermuda could enter the United States from certain parts of the Western Hemisphere using a wide variety of documents, including a driver's license issued by a state motor vehicle administration or a birth certificate, or in some cases for U. S. and Canadian citizens, without showing any documents. In the heightened national security environment following September 11, we have previously reported that documents like driver's licenses and birth certificates can easily be obtained, altered, or counterfeited and used by terrorists to travel {{into and out of the}} country. To help provide better assurance that border officials have the tools and resources to establish that people are who they say they are, as called for in the 9 / 11 Commission report, section 7209 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, as amended, requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to develop and implement a plan that requires a passport or other document or combination of documents that the Secretary of Homeland Security deems sufficient to show identity and citizenship for U. S. citizens and citizens of Bermuda, Canada, and Mexico when entering the United States from certain countries in North, Central, or South America. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) and the Department of State's (State) effort to specify acceptable documents and implement document requirements at 326 air, land, and sea ports of entry is called the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI). DHS is required by law to implement WHTI document requirements at the land and sea ports of entry on the earlier of two dates: June 1, 2009, or 3 months after DHS and State certify that certain implementation requirements have been met. U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a component within DHS, is the lead agency in charge of inspecting travelers seeking to enter the United States at air, land, and sea ports of entry. CBP has created a WHTI program office within CBP's Office of Field Operations to manage efforts to propose acceptable documents, implement document requirements, and oversee technological upgrades. In fiscal year 2008, DHS requested about $ 252 million for WHTI implementation, including approximately $ 166 million for related technological upgrades [...] to develop new software and to deploy that software and new hardware at 13 of the highest-volume U. S. land ports of entry. According to DHS, implementation of the WHTI document requirements and related technological upgrades will support its strategic goal of <b>facilitating</b> <b>legitimate</b> <b>trade</b> and travel while enforcing all U. S. trade, immigration, drug, consumer protection, intellectual property, and agricultural laws and regulations at the borders. According to DHS, the technological upgrades are designed to improve customer service by avoiding a more time-intensive and intrusive inspection process that would result from meeting WHTI document requirements without this technology. In May 2006, we reported our observations on steps taken and challenges faced by DHS and State in implementing WHTI in five main areas: (1) proceeding through the rulemaking process, (2) making a decision about what documents individuals will need when they enter the United States, (3) carrying out a cost-benefit study, (4) resolving technical and programmatic issues, and (5) managing implementation of the program.

40|$|The South African Revenue Service {{has since}} 2009 {{introduced}} “reference pricing” {{as a tool}} to detect undervaluation of customs values of imported clothing and textiles. The term “reference pricing” is not defined in the Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 which is the legislation that governs the importation of goods into the Republic of South Africa. The mandate of the South African Revenue Service, amongst others, is to <b>facilitate</b> <b>legitimate</b> <b>trade.</b> By applying the reference pricing guidelines the South African Revenue Service will target all importers who declare customs values which are less than the reference price for a targeted tariff heading associated with an item of clothing or textile. The Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 is clear in that the transaction value which is the price paid or payable for the imported goods shall be the value used for customs duty purposes. The Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 also requires that the interpretation of the sections 65, 66 and 67 of the said Act shall be subject to the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Valuation Agreement). Part I of the Valuation Agreement deals with the rules for customs valuation. Article 17 of part 1 allows for customs administrations to satisfy themselves as to the truth or accuracy of any statement, document or declaration presented for customs valuation purposes. The Technical Committee on Customs Valuation of the World Trade Organisation decided the following in so far as Article 17 of the aforesaid agreement is concerned: “ 1. When a declaration has been presented and where the customs administration has reason to doubt the truth or accuracy of the particulars or of documents produced in support of this declaration, the customs administration may ask the importer to provide further explanation, including documents or other evidence, that the declared value represents the total amount actually paid or payable for the imported goods, [...] ” It would appear that the South African Revenue Service is using reference prices {{as a tool to}} support its reason for doubting the truth or accuracy of the declared customs values. The indiscriminate use of reference pricing, it is submitted, affects <b>legitimate</b> <b>trade</b> adversely. This treatise provides an understanding of how the customs value should be determined in terms of the Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 and the Valuation Agreement. It then provides a background to reference pricing and how reference pricing will be used to detect undervalued imports of clothing and textiles, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using reference pricing and a comparative analysis of the approach adopted by the Mexican Tax Administration Service in so far as the use of reference pricing is concerned. It was established that the reference price cannot replace the customs value of an imported clothing item as the customs value is based on the price actually paid or payable for it and not on some arbitrary or fictitious value. The reference price can only be used as a tool to identify importers that are possibly undervaluing the customs values. The disadvantages far outweigh the advantages of using reference pricing. The treatise further provides a background to the use of a valuation database as a risk assessment tool and compares this to the use of reference pricing. The use of reference pricing and its impact on trade facilitation is then discussed as well as whether the use of reference pricing is consistent with the risk management principles as discussed in the World Customs Organisation Risk Management Guide. It was established that the South African Revenue Service has not disclosed the basis of arriving at the reference price per tariff heading that it targets and the use of reference pricing is not sanctioned by any international guideline or agreement. It was also established that the use of reference pricing targets compliant importers unnecessarily and this practice goes against the principles of trade facilitation. The use of reference pricing can be used as a tool to detect undervalued imports of clothing but should not be used as a basis to stop every consignment of clothing simply because the customs value declared is less than the reference price. It should not be used as a stand-alone tool but rather enhanced further with the recommendations provided. In the final analysis, recommendations are provided which seek to enhance the reference pricing mechanism and to further identify and exclude compliant importers and limit the use of reference pricing to target non-compliant importers who undervalue the customs value of imported clothing and textile items...|$|R
