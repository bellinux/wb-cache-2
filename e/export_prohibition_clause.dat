50|$|Immediately {{after the}} Thirty Years’ War the Bohemian towns had petitioned Ferdinand to refine its own raw {{materials}} into more finished goods for export. Becher became the leading force in attempting this conversion. By 1666 he had inspired {{the creation of}} a Commerce Commission (Kommerzkollegium) in Vienna, as well as the reestablishment of the first postwar silk plantation on the Lower Austrian estates of Hofkammer President Sinzendorf. Becher then subsequently helped create a Kunst- und Werkhaus in which foreign masters trained non-guild artisans in the production of finished goods. By 1672 he had promoted the construction of a wool factory in Linz. Four years later he established a textile workhouse for vagabonds in the Boemian town of Tabor that eventually employed 186 spinners under his own directorship. Some of Becher’s projects met with limited success. In time Linz’s new wool factory even became {{one of the largest and}} most important in Europe. Yet most of the government initiatives ended in failure. The Commerce Commission was doomed by Sinzendorf’s corruption and indifference. The Tabor workhouse nearly collapsed after just five years owing to the lack of government funding, and was then destroyed two years later during the Turkish invasion. The Oriental Company was fatally handicapped by a combination of poor management, government <b>export</b> <b>prohibitions</b> against Turkey, the opposition of Ottoman (principally Greek) merchants, and ultimately by the outbreak of war. The Kunst- und Werkhaus also folded during the 1680s, partly because of the regime’s unwillingness to import a significant number of foreign, Protestant teachers and skilled workers.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 7 years or so, the World Bank has {{expanded}} its rule of law agenda by moving into the area of criminal justice reform. This turn to criminal justice reform, however obvious it may be from a development perspective, was — and still is — a controversial step. This is because the World Bank, like most other multilateral development banks, is prohibited by its basic legal document, the Articles of Agreement, from interfering in the political affairs of its members. It must make its decisions {{on the basis of}} economic considerations only. Following the 2011 World Development Report, which made the case for World Bank involvement in criminal justice, in early 2012 the Bank’s legal vice presidency released the Legal Note on Bank Involvement in the Criminal Justice Sector and a Staff Guidance Note: World Bank Support for Criminal Justice Activities. This paper shows how the Legal Note and the Guidance Note, by offering new interpretations of the World Bank’s mandate and of the criminal justice sector, seek to incorporate criminal justice reform within the World Bank’s governance agenda. It argues that the interpretation offered by these documents is unconvincing in addressing the two components of the political <b>prohibition</b> <b>clause,</b> being the injunction to decide on the basis of economic considerations only and the prohibition on political interference. As a result, the Legal Note does not entirely succeed in its mission to provide ‘…a general legal framework for determining which interventions by the Bank in this sector would fall within the World Bank’s mandate under its Articles of Agreement’. This paper concludes by suggesting that some of the loose ends in the Legal Note and the Guidance Note {{can be explained by the}} purpose of this new legal interpretation of the mandate, which is not so much to provide a consistent legal argument, but rather — and above all — to play [to] constituencies with different interests and maintain the myth of a common understanding of the World Bank’s mandate and mission...|$|R

40|$|Allied {{blockade}} policy {{during the}} First World War jeopardized the traditionally amicable relations between Great Britain and Switzerland. Situated {{between the two}} belligerent camps, neutral Switzerland was compelled by the peculiarities of her economic structure to maintain normal commercial ties with both the Allies and the Central Powers. In exercising diplomatic and commercial pressure on the Swiss to minimize trade with Germany and Austria-Hungary in conformity {{with the demands of}} the blockade, the Foreign Office had to avoid the extremes of forcing the confederation into alliance with the enemy for the sake of economic survival, and of drawing her into complete dependence on the Allies for materials whose delivery would have constituted an embarrassment if not an impossibility. Direct pressure on the Swiss executive had its limits as the Swiss government could not compromise their nation's neutrality by issuing <b>export</b> <b>prohibitions</b> too favourable to Allied blockade policy. The British solution to these problems was found in a policy of agreed rationing and in the establishment in autumn 1915 of the S. S. S., a semi-official agency under the direction of Swiss businessmen. This body acted as unique consignee and distributor for all goods from the Allied countries or from abroad transported across Allied territory, and controlled the re-export of these goods to the Central Empires. German counter-pressures, Allied need for substitute markets in Switzerland, and the technical difficulties of imposing control on a free-wheeling economy made the operations of the trust organization at first difficult and unpopular. British firmness and Swiss realization of the advantages of co-operation, however, ultimately made the trust a great success so that by autumn 1916 the Swiss section of the blockade was regarded as the most efficient in Europe. At the same time, a jealous regard for their national sovereignty and forthright openness with both belligerent groups enabled the Swiss government to maintain complete political independence. A rational policy of commercial control, agreed to and conducted by Swiss businessmen under the guise of a commercial enterprise, obviated foreign interference in the political life of the nation and avoided the dangers for Swiss independence inherent in British wartime policy. In this way the continuance of cordial Anglo-Swiss relations was ensured during the difficult years 1914 - 1918...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of United States’bombing of two Japanese cities in 1945, the Soviet Union, by setting fire of a weapon competition, became the second State which has {{developed}} nuclear weapons and has global interest in the nuclear division.

The September 11 th incident has been increased concerns about the world’s nuclear power stations and means that could be target of the terrorists. After the Second World War, an increasing trend of proliferation of nuclear weapons have led to negotiations on the control and restrictions that would be concluded with reduction of these weapons as number. There is a fairly widespread belief that nuclear deterrence helped to maintain peace over several decades. Moreover, the employment of nuclear weapons is now envisaged - at least by some nuclear powers - not only as a last resort, but also as a way to react to any attacks committed with chemical or biological or even conventional weapons. As long as the use of nuclear weapons has not been unreservedly prohibited, the efforts to create a nuclear-weapon-free world will remain useless.

40|$|Medical {{malpractice}} insurance policies customarily contain a “cooperation” clause requiring insureds {{to cooperate with}} the insurer’s efforts to defend the insured against a claim. A common stipulation in this clause forbids the insured from “admitting liability ” to an injured or harmed party. Health professionals often understand this clause to have a chilling effect on the truthful disclosure of medical error, which is morally required of physicians when they know that a harm-causing error has occurred. This paper offers a two-part response to the fear that medical error disclosure might result in a denial of {{malpractice insurance}} coverage. Part one describes various legal precedents wherein insurers successfully invoked the cooperation clause to deny coverage in instances of liability admission. This paper shows, however, that the legally sanctioned reasons for denying coverage in these cases address factors other than an insured’s truthful and honest disclosure of what happened to a claimant. Consequently, these cases do not support the belief that legal precedents discourage the truthful disclosure of harm-causing medical errors. Part two of this paper proposes that the cooperation <b>clause’s</b> <b>prohibition</b> of admission of liability in instances of medical error disclosure might well be unenforceable, and that the clause might not even be actuarially sound...|$|R

40|$|As {{more states}} proceed with {{marijuana}} legalization laws, questions have arisen {{about how to}} accommodate those states that wish to retain prohibition. For instance, in 2014, Oklahoma and Nebraska unsuccessfully sued Colorado based on the spillover effects that Colorado’s marijuana legalization law had on its neighboring states. This article asserts that {{there are several reasons}} why state marijuana legalization laws are unlikely to have a large effect on neighboring states. First, marijuana is not a previously unobtainable good being introduced into the stream of commerce, as it is already available through the black market inexpensively. Second, legalization laws have a number of restrictions that make it very difficult for sellers to profit from exporting legally produced marijuana across state lines. Prohibition states may have reason to worry, however, that illegal marijuana growers will be better able to hide their operations in legalization states that allow residents to grow small amounts of marijuana for personal use, which in turn may increase illegal marijuana <b>exports</b> to neighboring <b>prohibition</b> states. Prohibition states can minimize this risk of increased marijuana flow by lobbying the federal government to establish rules that protect their interests...|$|R
500|$|Another of the UFA's {{policies}} {{called for}} a single tax on land to replace most other forms of taxation. [...] The farmers hoped that this tax would help replace tariffs, which made it {{harder for them to}} export their produce, and shift the tax burden towards cities, where land values were higher. [...] They also {{called for a}} surtax on undeveloped land to curb land speculation and encourage the sale of land to farmers. [...] On this demand too, Sifton acted: in 1911–1912 he allowed municipalities to levy property taxes and required that rural municipalities tax only land, and in 1914 he imposed a provincial tax on undeveloped land to discourage land speculation. [...] Other UFA-motivated acts by Sifton's government included abandonment of a 1912 plan to privatize hail insurance (it instead enacted a municipal insurance scheme) and the <b>prohibition</b> of contract <b>clauses</b> that allowed farm machinery companies to avoid responsibility for their products. [...] Perhaps the most important piece of farm legislation passed by Sifton's government was the incorporation of the Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Company (AFCEC).
