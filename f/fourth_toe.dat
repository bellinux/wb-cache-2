5|$|The {{count of}} dorsal scales, from axilla (armpit) to groin, averages 32 {{with a range}} of 30 to 35. The ventral count from axilla to groin along the midventral line averages 28 scales and ranges from 26 to 29. The scales around the midbody average {{approximately}} 52 and range from 50 to 55. There are two postnasals and one to three (usually two) internasal scales. There are two to three (usually three) scales from the upper lip to the eye (upper labials). On the <b>fourth</b> <b>toe</b> of the right foot, there are eight or nine (usually eight) lamellae, or plate-like scales that provide traction for geckos. The escutcheons (scales around the genital region) are relatively small and only slightly extend onto the thighs, varying from three to five scales in length and 11 to 13 scales in width.|$|E
5|$|In reptiles, {{features}} of the scales are important in distinguishing among species and groups of species. In the Noronha skink, the supranasal scales (located above the nose) are in contact, as are the prefrontal scales (behind the nose) in most individuals. The two frontoparietal scales (above and slightly behind the eyes) are not fused. Unlike in T.maculata, the parietal scales (behind the frontoparietals) are in contact with each other. There are four supraocular scales (above the eyes) in almost all specimens and five supraciliary scales (immediately above the eyes, below the supraoculars). The dorsal scales (on the upperparts) have three keels, two fewer than in T.maculata. There are 34 to 40 (mode 38) midbody scales (counted around the body midway between the fore- and hindlimbs), 58 to 69 (mode 63–64) dorsal, and 66 to 78 (mode 70) ventral scales (on the underparts). Mabuya species and T.maculata generally have fewer midbody scales (up to 34). There are 21 to 29subdigital lamellae under the <b>fourth</b> <b>toe,</b> more than in T.maculata, which has 18. The Noronha skink has 26presacral vertebrae (located before the sacrum), similar to most Trachylepis, but unlike American Mabuya, which have at least 28.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{powerful}} grasp with both their hands and feet due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands and feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180° {{from the rest of}} the fingers, while the hallux (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on the lower end of the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the <b>fourth</b> <b>toe</b> is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their hands and feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot.|$|E

5|$|More recent {{analyses}} {{using different}} sets of anatomical data have since cast doubt on a dromaeosaurid classification for Balaur. In 2013, a larger analysis containing {{a wide variety of}} coelurosaurs found that Balaur was not a dromaeosaurid at all, but a basal avialan, more closely related to modern birds than to Jeholornithiformes but more basal than Omnivoropterygiformes. A study published in 2014 found Balaur to be sister to Pygostylia. An independent analysis using an expanded version of the original data set (the one that found Balaur to be a dromaeosaurid) drew a similar conclusion in 2014. In 2015, researchers Andrea Cau, Tom Brougham, and Darren Naish published a study which specifically attempted to clarify which theropods were close relatives of Balaur. While their analysis could not completely {{rule out the possibility that}} B. bondoc was a dromaeosaurid, they concluded that this result was less likely than the classification of Balaur as a non-pygostylian avialan based on several important bird-like features. Many of the presumed unique traits would in fact have been normal for a member of the Avialae. Typical bird features included the degree of fusion of the limb bones, the functional first toe, the first toe claw not being smaller than the second claw, a long penultimate phalanx of the third toe, a small <b>fourth</b> <b>toe</b> claw and a long fifth metatarsal.|$|E

500|$|The long-toed {{salamander}} (Ambystoma macrodactylum, Baird 1849) is a mole salamander {{in the family}} Ambystomatidae. This species, typically [...] long when mature, is characterized by its mottled black, brown, and yellow pigmentation, and its long outer <b>fourth</b> <b>toe</b> on the hind limbs. Analysis of fossil records, genetics, and biogeography suggest A.macrodactylum and A.laterale are descended from a common ancestor that gained access to the western Cordillera {{with the loss of}} the mid-continental seaway toward the Paleocene.|$|E

500|$|As larvae metamorphose, {{they develop}} digits from their limb bud protrusions. A fully metamorphosed long-toed {{salamander}} has four digits {{on the front}} limbs and five digits on the rear limbs. Its head is longer than it is wide, and the long outer <b>fourth</b> <b>toe</b> on the hind limb of mature larvae and adults distinguishes this species from others and is also the etymological origin of its specific epithet: macrodactylum (Greek makros = long and daktylos = toe). The adult skin has a dark brown, dark grey, to black background with a yellow, green, or dull red blotchy stripe with dots and spots along the sides. Underneath the limbs, head, and body the salamander is white, pinkish, to brown with larger flecks of white and smaller flecks of yellow. Adults are typically [...] long.|$|E
500|$|Eremoryzomys polius is a large, long-tailed {{rice rat}} that in color resembles some North American woodrats (Neotoma). The fur is grayish above and lighter below, where the hairs are gray at the bases but white at the tips. The {{external}} ears (pinnae) are short and the tail is dark above and light below. The hindfeet have well-developed ungual tufts (patches of hair) along the plantar margins and between {{all of the}} digits, a character shared only with Sooretamys angouya among oryzomyines. The squamae, small structures resembling scales that cover the soles of the hindfeet in many oryzomyines, are well developed. The claw of the first digit extends nearly {{to the end of}} the first phalanx of the second toe and the claw of the fifth toe extends slightly beyond the first phalanx of the <b>fourth</b> <b>toe.</b> As in most oryzomyines, the female has eight mammae.

2500|$|The {{ancestors}} of the horse came to walk only {{on the end of}} the third toe and both side toes. Skeletal remnants show obvious wear on the back of both sides of metacarpal and metatarsal bones, commonly called the [...] "splint bones". They are the remnants of the second and the <b>fourth</b> <b>toe.</b> Modern horses retain the splint bones; they are often believed to be useless attachments, but they in fact play an important role in supporting the carpal joints (front knees) and even the tarsal joints (hocks).|$|E
6000|$|Without {{entering}} {{into the modern}} history of parish registers, we may borrow {{a few of the}} ancient curiosities to be found therein, the blunders and the waggeries of forgotten priests, and curates, and parish clerks. In quite recent times (1832) it was thought worth while to record that Charity Morrell at her wedding had signed her name in the register with her right foot, and that the ring had been placed on the <b>fourth</b> <b>toe</b> of her left foot; for poor Charity was born without arms. Sometimes the time of a birth was recorded with much minuteness, that the astrologers might draw a more accurate horoscope. Unlucky children, with no acknowledged fathers, were entered in a variety of odd ways. In Lambeth (1685), George Speedwell is put down as [...] "a merry begot;" [...] Anne Twine is [...] "filia uniuscujusque." [...] At Croydon, a certain William is [...] "terraefilius" [...] (1582), an autochthonous infant.

40|$|Transposition of the flexor digitorum longus tendon {{has been}} widely {{reported}} for the correction of flexible claw or hammer toe deformities. In contrast, {{a search of the}} literature revealed no previous reports of transposition of the flexor digitorum brevis tendon for treatment of these conditions. We performed a cadaver study to determine whether the flexor digitorum brevis tendon is long enough to be transferred to the dorsum of the proximal phalanx of the toe from its lateral or medial aspect. Transposition of the flexor digitorum brevis tendon was attempted in 180 toes of cadaver feet: 45 second toes, 45 third <b>toes,</b> 45 <b>fourth</b> <b>toes,</b> and 45 fifth toes. The flexor digitorum brevis tendon was long enough to be successfully transposed in 100 % of the second, third, and <b>fourth</b> <b>toes</b> and in 42 (93. 3 %) of the fifth toes. In the three remaining fifth toes (6. 7 %), the flexor digitorum brevis tendon was absent, a known anatomical variation. In conclusion, transfer of the flexor digitorum brevis tendon to the dorsum of the proximal phalanx can be performed for correction of claw or hammer toe deformities, especially in the second, third, and <b>fourth</b> <b>toes.</b> The transverse aponeurotic fibers originating from the extensor digitorum longus impede the transfer of the flexor digitorum brevis tendon, and meticulous excision of these fibers is essential {{to the success of the}} procedure.
