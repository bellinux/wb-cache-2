5|$|At {{each stage}} of metabolism, {{residual}} materials are excreted as <b>faeces,</b> urine, and bile.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Jesper Milàn {{and colleagues}} {{described}} two coprolites (fossilised <b>faeces)</b> containing fish scales and bones. They {{were found in}} the Jydegaard Formation, the first such fossils found in Danish continental Mesozoic deposits. Although the producer of these <b>faeces</b> cannot be identified with certainty, marine turtles and dromaeosaurids such as Dromaeosauroides are the most likely candidates.|$|E
5|$|British naturalists {{in colonial}} {{considered}} {{them to be}} among the ugliest birds, and their habit of feeding on <b>faeces</b> was particularly despised.|$|E
5|$|Fly larvae of {{the genus}} Fannia live in the nests of at least European bee-eaters, and feed on <b>faeces</b> and food remains. Their {{presence}} and cleaning activities appear to benefit the developing bee-eaters.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Mayor Chirac {{introduced}} the motorcycle-mounted Motocrotte to remove dog <b>faeces</b> from Paris streets. The project was abandoned in 2002 {{for a new}} and better enforced local law, {{under the terms of}} which dog owners can be fined up to €500 for not removing their dog <b>faeces.</b> The air pollution in Paris, {{from the point of view}} of particulate matter (PM10), is the highest in France with 38µg/m³.|$|E
5|$|Metagenomics {{can provide}} {{valuable}} {{insights into the}} functional ecology of environmental communities. Metagenomic analysis of the bacterial consortia found in the defecations of Australian sea lions suggests that nutrient-rich sea lion <b>faeces</b> {{may be an important}} nutrient source for coastal ecosystems. This is because the bacteria that are expelled simultaneously with the defecations are adept at breaking down the nutrients in the <b>faeces</b> into a bioavailable form that can be taken up into the food chain.|$|E
5|$|Sperm whales {{increase}} {{levels of}} primary production and carbon export by depositing iron-rich <b>faeces</b> into surface {{waters of the}} Southern Ocean. The iron-rich <b>faeces</b> cause phytoplankton to grow and take up more carbon from the atmosphere. When the phytoplankton dies, it sinks to the deep ocean and takes the atmospheric carbon with it. By reducing the abundance of sperm whales in the Southern Ocean, whaling has resulted in an extra 2 million tonnes of carbon remaining in the atmosphere each year.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's The Parts of Animals {{sets out}} enough {{details of his}} views on {{metabolism}} for an open flow model to be made. He believed that at each stage of the process, materials from food were transformed, with heat being released as the classical element of fire, and residual materials being excreted as urine, bile, or <b>faeces.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other commercially {{valuable}} products from birds include feathers (especially the down of geese and ducks), {{which are used}} as insulation in clothing and bedding, and seabird <b>faeces</b> (guano), which is a valuable source of phosphorus and nitrogen. The War of the Pacific, sometimes called the Guano War, was fought in part over the control of guano deposits.|$|E
5|$|Whales defecate at the ocean's surface; their {{excrement}} {{is important}} for fisheries because it is rich in iron and nitrogen. The whale <b>faeces</b> are liquid and instead of sinking, they stay at the surface where phytoplankton feed off it.|$|E
5|$|Arboreal carton nests of {{mangrove}} swamp-dwelling Nasutitermes are {{enriched in}} lignin and depleted in cellulose and xylans. This change {{is caused by}} bacterial decay in the gut of the termites: they use their <b>faeces</b> as a carton building material. Arboreal termites nests can account {{for as much as}} 2% of above ground carbon storage in Puerto Rican mangrove swamps. These Nasutitermes nests are mainly composed of partially biodegraded wood material from the stems and branches of mangrove trees, namely, Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove), Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and Laguncularia racemose (white mangrove).|$|E
5|$|C. longimanus feeds {{mainly on}} pelagic {{cephalopods}} and bony fish. However, its diet can {{be far more}} varied and less selectiveit is known to eat threadfins, stingrays, sea turtles, birds, gastropods, crustaceans, and mammalian carrion. The bony fish it feeds on include lancetfish, oarfish, barracuda, jacks, dolphinfish, marlin, tuna, and mackerel. Its feeding methods include biting into groups of fish and swimming through schools of tuna with an open mouth. When feeding with other species, it becomes aggressive. Peter Benchley, author of Jaws, observed this shark swimming among pilot whales and eating their <b>faeces.</b>|$|E
5|$|Colletid bees of {{the genus}} Leioproctus, {{subgenus}} Cladocerapis exclusively forage on and pollinate flowers of many species of Persoonia. Bees of subgenus Filiglossa in the same genus, which also specialise in feeding on Persoonia flowers, {{do not appear to}} be effective pollinators. Weighing 1900mg (0.07oz), the fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates, such as kangaroos, possums and currawongs and other large birds. Seeds have been recorded in the <b>faeces</b> of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata).|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on their}} feeding habits, {{termites}} are placed into two groups: the lower termites and higher termites. The lower termites predominately feed on wood. As wood {{is difficult to}} digest, termites prefer to consume fungus-infected wood because {{it is easier to}} digest and the fungi are high in protein. Meanwhile, the higher termites consume a wide variety of materials, including <b>faeces,</b> humus, grass, leaves and roots. The gut in the lower termites contains many species of bacteria along with protozoa, while the higher termites only have a few species of bacteria with no protozoa.|$|E
5|$|Females lay {{from ten}} to three hundred eggs at a time, {{depending}} on species, fertilising {{them with the}} stored sperm as they do so. Many species deposit the eggs on moist soil or organic detritus, but some construct nests lined with dried <b>faeces,</b> and may protect the eggs within silk cocoons. In most species, the female abandons the eggs after they are laid, but some species in the orders Platydesmida and Stemmiulida provide parental care for eggs and young.|$|E
5|$|From an {{ecological}} perspective, raptor populations {{in urban areas}} are highly beneficial. Compared with Europe where pigeon populations have exploded to the point they are both a tourist attraction and a public nuisance. Their <b>faeces</b> are highly acidic causing damage to historic buildings and statues made of soft stone. They nest in bridges where it compiles and damages iron work causing rust and corrosion. In the United States, falcon and other raptors are in numbers high enough to ward off pigeon nest building in major highrises.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Jacob Light and Horace Hodes {{proved that}} a {{filterable}} {{agent in the}} <b>faeces</b> of children with infectious diarrhoea also caused scours (livestock diarrhoea) in cattle. Three decades later, preserved samples of the agent were shown to be rotavirus. In the intervening years, a virus in mice was shown {{to be related to}} the virus causing scours. In 1973, Ruth Bishop and colleagues described related viruses found in children with gastroenteritis.|$|E
5|$|In the Amazon basin, when caimans became scarce as {{a result}} of {{overhunting}} in the mid-20th century, the number of local fish, such as the important arapaima (Arapaima gigas), also decreased. These are nutrient-poor waters, and the urine and <b>faeces</b> of the caimans may have increased primary production by contributing plant nutrients. Thus the presence of the reptiles could have benefited the fish stock; the number of crocodilians in a stretch of water appears to be correlated with the fish population.|$|E
5|$|Males exhibit {{pronounced}} marking behaviourterritories, termite mounds, trees, common tracks, and junctions {{are marked}} by urine, <b>faeces,</b> and claw scratches. Males marking their territory by urination stand less than a metre away from a tree or rock surface with the tail raised, pointing the penis either horizontally backward or 60° upward. Territorial clashes can take place between two coalitions, or coalitions and solitary males; fights, however, are rarely gruesome. Another major reason for fights is to acquire dominance in the breeding season. These can even involve cannibalism.|$|E
5|$|Systemic {{symptoms}} {{resulting from}} anaphylaxis can be dramatic. These may appear within 5 minutes post bite, {{or can be}} delayed for many hours. Such symptoms include nausea, retching and vomiting, abdominal colic and diarrhoea, incontinence of urine and <b>faeces,</b> sweating, fever, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, blindness, shock, angioedema of the face, lips, gums, tongue, throat and epiglottis, urticaria and bronchospasm. If left untreated, these symptoms may persist or fluctuate for up to 48 hours. In severe cases, cardiovascular failure may occur.|$|E
5|$|Termites rely {{on alarm}} {{communication}} {{to defend a}} colony. Alarm pheromones can be released when the nest has been breached or is being attacked by enemies or potential pathogens. Termites always avoid nestmates infected with Metarhizium anisopliae spores, through vibrational signals released by infected nestmates. Other methods of defence include intense jerking and secretion of fluids from the frontal gland and defecating <b>faeces</b> containing alarm pheromones.|$|E
5|$|The Duck End {{was one of}} {{the poorer}} districts of Aylesbury. Until the end of the 19thcentury it had no sewers or refuse collections. The area had a number of open ditches filled with {{stagnant}} water, and outbreaks of malaria and cholera were common. The cottages had inadequate ventilation and lighting, and no running water. <b>Faeces</b> from the duck ponds permeated the local soil and seeped into the cottages through cracks in the floors.|$|E
5|$|The European {{nightjar}} {{feeds on}} a wide variety of flying insects, including moths, beetles, mantises, dragonflies, cockroaches and flies. It will pick glowworms off vegetation. It consumes grit to aid with digesting its prey, but any plant material and non-flying invertebrates consumed are taken inadvertently while hunting other food items. Young chicks have been known to eat their own <b>faeces.</b>|$|E
5|$|The bulk of {{the water}} intake of Hemilepistus reaumuri is by taking up water vapour from {{saturated}} air and by eating damp sand. Water loss is minimised by the rectal epithelium, which absorbs water, ensuring that the <b>faeces</b> is drier than the food the animal consumed. Evaporation of water through the permeable exoskeleton may, however, provide a valuable cooling effect.|$|E
5|$|The diet {{consists}} of insects {{and other small}} arthropods. One study of red-capped robin <b>faeces</b> conducted near Kambalda, Western Australia, revealed 96% of their diet {{was made up of}} beetles, while ants made up the remainder. Other prey recorded include spiders, and insects such as grasshoppers including the Australian Plague Locust (Chortoicetes terminifera), adult and larval butterflies and moths, including geometer moths, dragonflies and damselflies, mantises, antlions, true bugs, including chinch bugs of the family Lygaeidae and shield bugs, various types of beetles, earwigs, and flies such as blow-flies and horse-flies.|$|E
5|$|The main {{nitrogenous}} {{waste product}} is ammonia. Starfish have no distinct excretory organs; waste ammonia is removed by diffusion through the tube feet and papulae. The body fluid contains phagocytic cells, coelomocytes, {{which are also}} found within the hemal and water vascular systems. These cells engulf waste material, and eventually migrate to {{the tips of the}} papulae, where a portion of body wall is nipped off and ejected into the surrounding water. Some waste may also be excreted by the pyloric glands and voided with the <b>faeces.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} usually found in dry sclerophyll forest on sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soil. It has adapted to a fire-prone environment; plants lost in bushfires can {{regenerate}} through a ground-stored seed bank. Seedlings mostly germinate {{within two years}} of fires. Several species of native bee of the genus Leioproctus pollinate the flowers. Swamp wallabies are a main consumer of its fruit, and the seeds are spread in wallaby <b>faeces.</b> Its lifespan ranges from 25 to 60 years, though difficulties in propagation have seen low cultivation rates.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} is very {{efficient}} at eating its prey; {{not only is}} it able to splinter and eat the largest ungulate bones, it is also able to digest them completely. Spotted hyenas can digest all organic components in bones, not just the marrow. Any inorganic material is excreted with the <b>faeces,</b> which consist almost entirely of a white powder with few hairs. They react to alighting vultures more readily than other African carnivores, {{and are more likely to}} stay in the vicinity of lion kills or human settlements.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The {{incoming}} material, food, enters {{the body and}} is concocted into blood; waste is excreted as urine, bile, and <b>faeces,</b> and the element fire is released as heat. Blood is made into flesh, the rest forming other earthy tissues such as bones, teeth, cartilages and sinews. Leftover blood is made into fat, whether soft suet or hard lard. Some fat {{from all around the}} body is made into semen.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens die {{most often}} by being shot or poisoned—generally by farmers. Despite their fondness for roadkill, fewer ravens are hit by {{vehicles}} than Australian magpies. Research in the 1950s and 60s showed that 64% of Australian ravens perished {{in their first}} year of life. Immature birds are most at risk of dying as {{they are more likely to}} come into conflict with farmers. The Australian Raven is a peaceful bird, showing no aggression toward humans or other birds without reason. However, the Australian raven is frequently blamed for the loss of young lambs. Scientific observation in the country's southeast showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked. Australian ravens mostly eat <b>faeces</b> (often from the lamb's anus), afterbirth or stillborn lambs. Newborn lamb <b>faeces</b> is nutritious, containing around 21–44% protein, 9–37% fat and 10–30% carbohydrate. It has the consistency of treacle and often sticks to the lamb's hindquarters or tail. The raven bites a sleeping lamb's tail, holding on and walking behind it when it wakes up. A healthy lamb would respond by running away or butting the bird, but a sick one might not respond and be attacked further as it alerts the bird that it is vulnerable. Wounded lambs can also succumb to Clostridium infection as these bacteria are present on raven bills. Ravens bring some benefits to agricultural areas as they clean away carrion and eat insects that are potentially damaging to crops. In areas of Western Australia, the species is classified as a Declared Pest of Agriculture under the provisions of the Agriculture and Related Resources Protection Act 1976, meaning that shooting on private land in rural areas is legal, although should be considered only after other options have been exhausted.|$|E
5|$|Books are {{sometimes}} attacked by cockroaches, silverfish, book mites, booklice, and various beetles which {{feed on the}} covers, paper, bindings and glue. They leave behind physical damage {{in the form of}} tiny holes as well as staining from their <b>faeces.</b> Book pests include the larder beetle, and the larvae of the black carpet beetle and the drugstore beetle which attack leather-bound books, while the common clothes moth and the brown house moth attack cloth bindings. These attacks are largely a problem with historic books, because modern bookbinding materials are less susceptible to this type of damage.|$|E
5|$|Eusociality {{involves}} cooperative {{brood care}} (including brood care of offspring from other individuals), overlapping generations within {{a colony of}} adults, and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive groups. Few organisms outside Hymenoptera exhibit this behavior; the only beetle {{to do so is}} the weevil Austroplatypus incompertus. This Australian species lives in horizontal networks of tunnels, in the heartwood of Eucalyptus trees. It is one of more than 300 species of wood-boring Ambrosia beetles which distribute the spores of ambrosia fungi. The fungi grow in the beetles' tunnels, providing food for the beetles and their larvae; female offspring remain in the tunnels and maintain the fungal growth, probably never reproducing. Cooperative brood care is also found in the bess beetles (Passalidae) where the larvae feed on the semi-digested <b>faeces</b> of the adults.|$|E
5|$|Flea larvae {{emerge from}} the eggs to feed on any {{available}} organic material such as dead insects, <b>faeces,</b> conspecific eggs, and vegetable matter. In laboratory studies, some dietary diversity seems necessary for proper larval development. Blood-only diets allow only 12% of larvae to mature, whereas blood and yeast or dog chow diets allow almost all larvae to mature. Another study also showed that 90% of larvae matured into adults when the diet included nonviable eggs. They are blind and avoid sunlight, keeping to dark, humid places such as sand or soil, cracks and crevices, under carpets and in bedding.|$|E
5|$|Flying {{insects that}} {{parasitise}} common starlings include the louse-fly Omithomya nigricornis and the saprophagous fly Camus hemapterus. The latter species breaks off the feathers of its host and {{lives on the}} fats produced by growing plumage. Larvae of the moth Hofmannophila pseudospretella are nest scavengers, which feed on animal material such as <b>faeces</b> or dead nestlings. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} common starlings, but a better known pest is the brilliant scarlet nematode Syngamus trachea. This worm moves from the lungs to the trachea and may cause its host to suffocate. In Britain, the rook and the common starling are the most infested wild birds. Other recorded internal parasites include the spiny-headed worm Prosthorhynchus transverses.|$|E
5|$|Governments are {{particularly}} concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases {{that can affect}} domestic animals which may acquire them {{as a result of}} insufficient biosecurity. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating flying foxes, their <b>faeces</b> and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. Avian flu H5N1 is present in wild bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include rabies, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and trichinosis.|$|E
5|$|Green-head ants are prey for {{a number}} of predators, {{including}} assassin bugs and the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), in the <b>faeces</b> of which have been found worker ants. Birds also eat these ants, including the Australian white ibis (Threskiornis moluccus), black kite (Milvus migrans), masked lapwing (Vanellus miles) and the Australian owlet-nightjar (Aegotheles cristatus). Workers and larvae can be infected by parasites; examined workers were seen with late-stage pupae of an unidentified parasite in their thoraces. In some nests of the green-head ant, some myrmecophilous insects such as the beetle Chlamydopsis longipes are sometimes seen living inside colonies.|$|E
