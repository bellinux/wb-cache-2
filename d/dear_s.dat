To show that specific changes in the biologic properties of variant K were due to mutation in the S 1 double-stranded RNA segment (gene), which encodes the viral hemagglutinin, we generated a reassortant virus (" 1 HA K") containing the variant K S 1 gene and compared its properties to variant K and to a reassortant (" 1 HA 3 ") containing the T 3 (<b>Dearing)</b> <b>S</b> 1 gene. These studies, in conjunction with our previous nucleotide sequence analysis of the S 1 genes of variant K and T 3 (Dearing) [R. Bassel-Duby, A. Jayasuriya, D. Chatterjee, N. Sonenberg, J. V.

60|$|MY <b>DEAR</b> <b>S.</b> C.,--I suppose {{this will}} be my last note then. I think you will find {{everything}} very jolly here, I am very jolly myself. I worked six hours to-day. I am occupied in transcribing The Bottle, which is pleasant work to me; I find much in it that I still think excellent and much that I am doubtful about; my convention is so terribly difficult that I have to put out much that pleases me, and much that I still preserve I only preserve with misgiving. I wonder if my convention is not a little too hard and {{too much in the}} style of those decadent curiosities, poems without the letter E, poems going with the alphabet and the like. And yet the idea, if rightly understood and treated as a convention always and not as an abstract principle, should not so much hamper one as it seems to do. The idea is not, of course, to put in nothing but what would naturally have been noted and remembered and handed down, but not to put in anything that would make a person stop and say--how could this be known? Without doubt it has the advantage of making one rely on the essential interest of a situation and not cocker up and validify feeble intrigue with incidental fine writing and scenery, and pyrotechnic exhibitions of inappropriate cleverness and sensibility. I remember Bob once saying to me that the quadrangle of Edinburgh University was a good thing and our having a talk as to how it could be employed in different arts. I then stated that the different doors and staircases ought to be brought before a reader of a story not by mere recapitulation but by the use of them, by the descent of different people one after another by each of them. And that the grand feature of shadow and the light of the one lamp in the corner should also be introduced only as they enabled people in the story to see one another or prevented them. And finally that whatever could not thus be worked into the evolution of the action had no right to be commemorated at all. After all, it is a story you are telling; not a place you are to describe; and everything that does not attach itself to the story is out of place.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dear</b> <b>S.</b> I. N. readers, it {{has been}} a very long time since the last edition and we must thank you for your enviable patience. We are now very pleased to deliver this issue, which is {{dedicated}} largely to the 19 th Symposium in Venice. Along with recent news announcements, it contains the detailed Symposium program and the full collection of abstracts. It provides an opportunity for those who were unable to attend this delightful and scientifically stimulating meeting to still enjoy its intellectual content. We are committed to continuing to develop S. I. N. to make it as interesting, widely accessible and useful as possible. As it is a tool to promote communication and capacity building, the editors recommended, and the Board agreed, that the electronic version of S. I. N. should now be free. As a searchable PDF file, it can be quickly searched to locate information of interest. It can also be easily e-mailed to subscribers or made available for download from the WTS website. The paper version is costly to produce and distribute, so national libraries and other subscribers who require hard copies will still have to purchase their subscriptions. With regard to content, there is ongoing interest in developing new columns and enhancing established ones, such as the popular Viewpoints. We are currently seeking material for the next issue, which will appear before the Stockholm symposium in June next year. Please consider writing an opinion piece (the more controversial the better!) or providing suggestions for improvements to S. I. N. and the WTS, or ideas about how we can become a more relevant and accessible source of information for corporate and government decision-makers. There is an enormous pool of talent and expertise in our organization and we should ensure that it produces as much benefit as possible for shiftworkers and the wider workforce...|$|E

Human Mutation, 6 (4), 326 - 333 We have collated {{the results}} of cystic fibrosis (CF) mutation analysis conducted in 22 laboratories in the United Kingdom. A total of 9, 807 CF chromosomes have been analysed, demonstrating 56 different mutations so far observed and accounting for 86 % of CF genes in the native Caucasian population of the United Kingdom. Delta F 508 {{is the most common}} at 75. 3 % of CF mutations (range 56. 5 - 83. 7 %), followed by G 551 D (3. 08 %; range 0. 71 - 7. 60 %), G 542 X (1. 68 %; range 0. 85 - 3. 66 %), 621 + 1 (G>T) (0. 93 %; range 0. 41 - 3. 16 %), 1717 - 1 (G>A) (0. 57 %; range 0. 17 - 1. 14 %), 1898 + 1) (G>A) (0. 46 %), R 117 H (0. 46 %), N 1303 K (0. 46 %), and R 553 X (0. 46 %), The data show a clear geographical variation in the distribution of some of the mutations, most notably a marked regional variation in the distribution of 621 + 1 (G>T) and 1989 + 1 (G>A), which are both apparently more frequent in Wales. R 560 T and R 117 H appear to be more frequent in Ireland and Scotland, and G 551 D more frequent in Scotland. In summary, these data illustrate that the mutations present within a particular population need to be defined in order to provide meaningful carrier screening and testing for rare mutations in affected individuals. Furthermore, it is apparent that the ethnic origin of a patient, even within a small country such as the United Kingdom, should be taken into account. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The candy is in fine shape and will be consumed rapidly. The box it came in {{must have been the}} plaything of every baggage-smasher from Providence to the Southwest. How it held together is one of those miracles. The PO here marked it “Received in Bad Order,” but {{as long as it was}} bad order and not bad odor, who cares? All of us fellows here sure appreciate it, I assure you. Do not let that peaceful scene above [etched landscape with cowboy and horse at top of stationery] fool you. Maybe at some times of the year a cowboy could sit down and watch the cattle from a hill, but right now he would freeze to death. The cattle and the horses have thick, shaggy coats and for the last two weeks they have had a tough time finding anything to eat because of all the snow. Of course I have had to do more driving around the country the last two months than ever before and none of the trucks have cabs. You might think it would build a fellow up but it doesn’t. Just wears him out. And to think I went to Bryant so I could get a soft job, inside, and wouldn’t have to be tough at all. But I can’t kick. I’m still in a good country. You ask for changes in address. It’s on the envelope. The best of luck to all of you and may the draft board ignore all of you entirely. Keep grinning’, 								Len Crawley 								[Transcription ends...|$|R
40|$|Transcription begins] CAMP HAAN * CALIFORNIA August 2, 1943 <b>Dear</b> B. <b>S.</b> C., A {{week ago}} I {{received}} your very interesting letter and enclosure of addresses. It {{is the first}} of that type I have received from you, and it was really swell. We are training a new group of men here, they have been here nearly a month now, and are learning fast. They come from Virginia, and believe me, you have never seen a group with so many guitar players. I am trying hard to write in the language I was taught, so if I slip up, please blame the music. The past three weeks have been very hot here, which is supposed to be unusual. In a few weeks we go to the desert for three weeks then back to Haan for more training. It will be my second trip, and from latest reports the temperature is 150 ° in the shade, but from experience I know there is no shade there. A week ago I saw a Liberator (B- 24) crash and burn. It hit just two blocks from where we were, and besides burning gas and oil, the. 50 ca. Mach. gun ammo was popping off in all directions. It was a terrible mess- especially to see them bring out one of the charred bodies. Glad our job is to shoot them down rather than fly them. Was sorry to hear Mrs. Doe [?] was so ill, and hope that by now she is well again. She was certainly a swell housemother. Am glad to see my classmates are doing so well in their branches of service, and hope they are all enjoying life. We have a lot of headaches here, as everywhere, but I wouldn’t want to return to civilian life for anything until the war is over. In case you didn’t receive my last letter thanking you for the cigarettes, I would like to do so now. I certainly appreciate them, and I know all the other fellows feel the same way. Note that you have a shortage of boys at school now, and can certainly understand why. Regardless of that I hope Bryant is still going strong, and hope the day of the greatest alumni at Bryant will soon be home. Congratulations to the Bryant Service Club for the sell work it is doing. Sincerely,Eugene Schmidt [Transcription ends...|$|R

The writer is {{emphasizing}} here, the following points: 1) to the four or five, usually taken as made for {{each one of these}} two friends, could well be added other four or five themes illustrating the same symbol-allegorical idea. 2) all of these themes should definitely not be neglected, ewenless ignored, as they usually are, because of the lost originals, they have been fortunately saved just as the copies - some made by don Giulio Klović. 3) at the contrary, they are all rather quite important not only because they are some of just few chosen ones by Michelangelo himself but most of all to illustrate his personal double (dogmatic and moral) theology of salvation. Not, as it is persistently repeated of his (and of his friends so called »solafideism«. Namely, the paintings (for Marchesa) taken from the Gospel, symbolizing the Christo-mariological dogmatic theology while the mythological »carte« (for T. de 2 ̆ 7 Cavalieri) ilustrating his orthodox moral theology of salvation. - The article is dedicated to the glorious memory of don Giulio Klović de Croazia, »maximus in minimis« the esteemed friend of Michelangelo and of two named ones, particularly, because Klović saved by his perfect coples some of the originals - a fact not acknowledged (1978) for the IV-th centennial of his immortality...|$|R
6000|$|Whether {{the fair}} lady tried her wiles upon Colonel Newcome the present writer has no certain means of ascertaining: but I think another image {{occupied}} his heart: and this Circe tempted him {{no more than}} a score of other enchantresses who had tried their spells upon him. If she tried she failed. She was a very shrewd woman, quite frank in her talk when such frankness suited her. She said to me, [...] "Colonel Newcome has had some great passion, once upon a time, I am sure of that, and has no more heart to give away. The woman who had his must have been a very lucky woman: though I daresay she did not value what she had; or did not live to enjoy it--or--or something or other. You see tragedies in some people's faces. I recollect when we were in Coventry Island--there was a chaplain there--a very good man--a Mr. Bell, and married to a pretty little woman who died. The first day I saw him I said, 'I know that man has had a great grief in life. I am sure that he left his heart in England.' You gentlemen who write books, Mr. Pendennis, and stop at the third volume, know very well that the real story often begins afterwards. My third volume ended when I was sixteen, and was married to my poor husband. Do you think all our adventures ended then, and that we lived happy ever after? I live for my darling girls now. All I want is to see them comfortable in life. Nothing can be more generous than my dear brother James has been. I am only his half-sister, you know, and was an infant in arms when he went away. He had differences with Captain Mackenzie, who was headstrong and imprudent, and I own my poor dear husband was in the wrong. James could not live with my poor mother. Neither could by possibility suit the other. I have often, I own, longed to come and keep house for him. His home, the society he sees, of men of talents like Mr. Warrington and--and I won't mention names, or pay compliments to a man who knows human nature so well as the author of Walter Lorraine: this house is pleasanter a thousand times than Musselburgh--pleasanter for me and my dearest Rosey, whose delicate nature shrunk and withered up in poor mamma's society. She was never happy except in my room, the dear child! She's all gentleness and affection. She doesn't seem to show it: but she has the most wonderful appreciation of wit, of genius, and talent of all kinds. She always hides her feelings, except from her fond old mother. I went up into our room yesterday, and found her in tears. I can't bear to see her eyes red or to think of her suffering. I asked her what ailed her, and kissed her. She is a tender plant, Mr. Pendennis! Heaven knows with what care I have nurtured her! She looked up smiling on my shoulder. She looked so pretty! 'Oh, mamma,' the darling child said, 'I couldn't help it. I have been crying over Walter Lorraine.' (Enter Rosey.) Rosey, darling! I have been telling Mr. Pendennis what a naughty, naughty child you were yesterday, and how you read a book which I told you you shouldn't read; for it is a very wicked book; and though it contains some sad sad truths, it is a great deal too misanthropic (is that the right word? I'm a poor soldier's wife, and no scholar, you know), and a great deal too bitter; and though the reviews praise it, and the clever people--we are poor simple country people--we won't praise it. <b>Sing,</b> <b>dearest,</b> that little song" [...] (profuse kisses to Rosey), [...] "that pretty thing that Mr. Pendennis likes." ...|$|R
40|$|In the Orient, {{especially}} in the Semitic Orient, the expression »Image of God« (Gen: 1, 26 - 27) originally means {{the presence of the}} deity. Thus the expression that man was created in the image of God means primarily that God resides in man, is present in him, dose to him, and that this presence is benevolent. To choose to be present in and close to one - and the creation of man was certainly an act of choice - means to designate him as a friend. Thus man received the gift of freeedom in order to choose (or not) God as his friend. The Scripture says that man broke his pact of friendship with God, so God sent him away. In spite of this, God 2 ̆ 7 s presence in man has not been completely obliterated. Cain killed his brother Abel. God strictly forbade the killing of a man with the argument that man was made in God 2 ̆ 7 s image (Gen 9 : 5 - 6). If man is God 2 ̆ 7 s image, a being graced with God 2 ̆ 7 s presence, then homicide is in fact theocide. Jesus Christ said that God is the Father. Therefore to kill God in man is an act of patricide. The killing of man is also an act of fratricide. Christ is an image of God, he is the Son of God the Father, but he is also a brother to all men whom he taught and exhorted to call God » 0 ur Father«. The killing of a man is therefore the killing of Christ, Son of God, man 2 ̆ 7 s brother. Thus homicide is fratricide. Killing a man, the brother of the Son of God, one kills, attempts to kill one 2 ̆ 7 s brother. Because every man is Christ 2 ̆ 7 s brother. Who kills a man kills his brother. The killing of a man is also the killing of a friend, amicocide. By creating man in his own image, a being graced by his presence and closeness, God chose him as a friend. Conseguently, if I am God 2 ̆ 7 s friend, and if my neighbour is also God 2 ̆ 7 s friend, and if God is friend to both of us, the other and I are neighbours in Biblical terms, namely friends. Thus to kill a man means to kill a friend, a friend of God and our own friend. The killing of a man is suicide. The Word »thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself« (Lev 19; 18) is usually understood as a comparison of manner: love your neighbour in the same way you love yourself. Without denying the validity of this interpretation, I also see the possibility of the following meaning: love your neighbour as you love the one who is »you«, the extension, the continuation of your own self, the expansion of your own self, and therefore as your own self. Thus killing one 2 ̆ 7 s neighbour means to kill oneself. Homicide is in fact suicide. Suicid is the murder of neighbours, proximicide. Just as my neighbour is an extension of myself, so I am an extension of my neighbour 2 ̆ 7 s self. To raise one 2 ̆ 7 s hand against oneself means to raise it against one 2 ̆ 7 s neighbour, the one who is an extension of myself by beeing God 2 ̆ 7 s image. Man is God 2 ̆ 7 s image through the presence of God in himself. However, man also resembles God. I will single out one essential similarity: his state of Being. God says »I am that I am« (Exodus 3, 13 - 15) as his name, thus as his essence. By Saying »I am« man is like God. Murder is an attempt to destroy the basic likeness of man with God, who is Existence itself, whose name is »I am«. This is why homicide is sacrilege. Murder is an iconoclasm. An assault on God 2 ̆ 7 s image. Where does killing originate in human history? From Satan. Satan means adversary. We know whose adversary: God 2 ̆ 7 s. If the Being and Existence of God is to give something as a gift, then his Adversary is caracterized by opposite: to deny existence, to destroy and encite destruction, and above all the destruction of God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>dearest</b> gift, the existence of man. »He was murder from the beginning« (John 8 : 44). Similar to God who is, man is forever: Who says »I am« once can never again revert to »I am not«. This similarity with God is the basis of man 2 ̆ 7 s eternity. There {{is no such thing as}} a perfect crime. Murder is the greatest crime. There is no perfect murder. More than that, murder is never perfected. What remains ist just attempted murder. By killing a man the murder has not destroyed him. The first punishment for the murder is the fact that he believers he has killed a man, but this is not so. The further punishement is the fact that by killing another he has killed himself. Murder is a attempt at killing God - theocide, falling the Father -patricide, killing a brother - fratricide, killing a friend - amicocide, killing oneself - suicide, and killing one 2 ̆ 7 s neighbour - proximicide. It is attempt only because man, ever if killed, is God 2 ̆ 7 s image and God 2 ̆ 7 s likeness, God is in him and in his enternal existence he is like the Existing, the Eternal. The killing is the killer 2 ̆ 7 s greatest betrayal. If the killing had been successful, if the victim had been done away with, destroyed, eliminated from existence, that would be the victory of the Fiend, Satan, the Devil, the adversary of existence. But, as the Scripure says, he can never win. He can win battles, but never final war...|$|R
