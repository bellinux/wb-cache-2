5|$|On November 3, 1828, President <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams,</b> {{having been}} told that the executions would likely spark another uprising, pardoned the prisoners in {{exchange}} for a land cession. In July and August 1829, in treaties signed at Prairie du Chien, the Three Fires Confederacy and the Ho-Chunks formally ceded the lead mining region to the United States for annual payments of $16,000 and $18,000 respectively.|$|E
5|$|As president, <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams</b> had {{previously}} disallowed {{trade between the}} United States and West Indies during his tenure. However, following {{the passage of the}} 1827 hurricane, the politician allowed free trade for three months. Presidential candidate Andrew Jackson soon became outspoken against cutting ties between the two regions, and his support for free trade garnered support from shipping interests that helped him win the presidency a year later.|$|E
5|$|Most Native Americans in {{the region}} decided against joining the uprising, and so the {{conflict}} ended after U.S. officials responded with a show of military force. Ho-Chunk chiefs surrendered eight men {{who had participated in}} the violence, including Red Bird, who American officials believed to be the ringleader. Red Bird died in prison in 1828 while awaiting trial; two other men convicted of murder were pardoned by President <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams</b> and released.|$|E

5000|$|Dowgin's first nonfiction {{work was}} [...] "Salem Secret Underground: The History of the Tunnels in the City." [...] It gives {{the history of}} Elias Hasket Derby Jr. who went through a fifth or 38th of the largest estate in American history in less than 2 years. Now the son of America's first millionaire needs a day job in 1801. This coincides with Thomas Jefferson's new custom duties which are {{unfavorable}} in Federalist Salem. Following Charles Bulfinch's lead in Boston when he filled in the mud flats off the Charles River to make the Back Bay neighborhoods, Derby will create the Salem Common Improvement Fund {{to raise money to}} fill in the 5 ponds and the river leading to Collins Cove with tunnel dirt. Above board the subscription was to be a beautification program of a local park. He had 158 subscribers pay for the project and utilize the descendants of our nation's first National Guard to dig the tunnels and beautify the park. The subscribers included Associate Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Crowninshield, Secretary of State Timothy Pickering, Senator Nathaniel Silsbee, and many others. Tunnels that George Washington, <b>John</b> Adams,John <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams,</b> and James Monroe walked through. As inspired by Bulfinch who built the Poor Farm building, Looby Asylum, Old Town Hall, and the Essex Bank Building in town the tunnels would be attached to the homes through the fireplace arches in the basement. Once attached to the fireplace arches it created a draw system for the tunnel to receive fresh air and alleviated the previous flashing problem. The tunnels were attached to brick Federalist mansions that had four exterior chimneys.|$|R

5|$|As of 30 June 1854, {{the crew}} of Albany {{consisted}} of 18 officers, 156 seaman, and 23 Marines. It is likely the ship's complement was little changed when she was lost three months later.

5|$|Gore's {{windfall}} was realized when in 1790 the United States Congress, {{acting on}} a proposal made by Alexander Hamilton and supported by Gore's friend Rufus King, passed legislation that exchanged Continental and state paper for new U.S. paper at face value. Not only did Gore win on this exchange, but the paper he received appreciated in value before he sold it. The exact amount he made is unclear from the surviving documents: <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams</b> wrote that Gore's speculations made him the wealthiest lawyer in the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1800, Adams lost {{re-election}} to Thomas Jefferson {{and retired}} to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed {{his friendship with}} Jefferson upon the latter's own retirement by initiating a correspondence which lasted fourteen years. He and his wife established a family of politicians, diplomats, and historians now {{referred to as the}} Adams political family. Adams was the father of <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams,</b> the sixth President of the United States. He died on the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, and the same day as Jefferson. Modern historians in the aggregate have favorably ranked his administration.|$|E

After his brief service as Kentucky Secretary of State, {{the state legislature}} elected Crittenden to the second of his four non-consecutive stints in the U.S. Senate. Upon his election as president, William Henry Harrison appointed Crittenden as Attorney General, but 5 months after Harrison's death, political differences prompted him to resign rather than continue his service under Harrison's successor, John Tyler.|$|E

As a young man, Prescott frequented the Boston Athenæum, which at the time held the 10,000-volume private library of <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams,</b> who was on a diplomatic mission to Russia. In 1832, Prescott became a trustee of the library, a position he held for 15years.|$|E

Since the leading candidate in opposition to President <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams</b> was General Andrew Jackson, a Mason who mocked opponents of the order, Anti-Masonry became closely associated with opposition to Jackson, and to his policies once he was elected president in 1828.|$|E

5|$|Stevens's first {{political}} {{cause was}} Anti-Masonry, which became widespread in 1826 after the disappearance {{and death of}} William Morgan, a Mason in Upstate New York; fellow Masons were presumed to be the killers of Morgan because they disapproved of his publishing a book revealing the order's secret rites.

5|$|With {{the roads}} {{becoming}} impassable, Lafayette stayed in Washington City {{for the winter}} of 1824–25, and thus {{was there for the}} climax of the hotly contested 1824 election, in which no presidential candidate was able to secure a majority of the Electoral College, throwing the decision to the House of Representatives. On 9 February 1825, that body selected Secretary of State <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams</b> as president; that evening, the runner-up, General Andrew Jackson, shook hands with Adams at the White House as Lafayette looked on.|$|E
5|$|Dennie had health trouble {{throughout}} his life, {{as well as}} a predilection for wine. His father (who had battled mental illness) died on September 28, 1811; Dennie was not able to attend his father's funeral, as he himself was gravely ill at the time, and this caused him great grief. He briefly recovered, but succumbed to cholera morbus four months after his father's death. Dennie died on January 7, 1812, and was interred two days later at St. Peter's Church, Philadelphia. His epitaph was written by <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams.</b> The epitaph erroneously gives Lexington, Massachusetts as his birthplace; in fact, Dennie was born in Boston, but his family moved to Lexington shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Letcher's {{family came}} to Kentucky around 1800. Letcher {{attended}} the private academy of Joshua Fry, then studied law. He was briefly a judge advocate in John Allen's volunteer militia during the War of 1812. He began {{his political career}} in 1813, representing Garrard County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. In 1823, {{he was elected to}} the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served for more than a decade. During the 1824 presidential election, he acted as an intermediary between <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams</b> and Henry Clay.

5|$|A House select {{committee}} headed by <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams,</b> an ardent abolitionist who disliked slaveholders like Tyler, condemned the president's {{use of the}} veto and assailed his character. While the committee's report did not formally recommend impeachment, it clearly established the possibility, and in August 1842 the House endorsed the committee's report. Adams sponsored {{a constitutional amendment to}} change both houses' two-thirds requirement (for overriding vetoes) to a simple majority, but neither house approved. The Whigs were unable to pursue further impeachment proceedings in the subsequent 28th Congress—in the elections of 1842 they retained a majority in the Senate but lost control of the House. Near the end of Tyler's term in office, on March 3, 1845, Congress overrode his veto of a minor bill relating to revenue cutters—the first override of a presidential veto.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun {{began his}} {{political}} career in the House of Representatives. As a prominent leader of the war hawk faction, Calhoun strongly supported the War of 1812 to defend American honor against British infractions of American independence and neutrality during the Napoleonic Wars.

Calhoun was {{a candidate for the}} presidency in the 1824 election. After failing to gain support, he let his name be put forth as a candidate for vice president.
