40|$|Number of floors for a voice-only {{conference on}} packet {{networks}} – a conjecture R. V. Prasad, H. S. Jamadagni and H. N. Shankar Abstract: Voice conferencing {{is an essential}} block of any multimedia system used for collaborative work, as voice is shared by all participants. Floor control is mission-critical here and has been investigated by many to ensure fair resource sharing; yet fixing the number of floors has remained an open problem. A conferee (participant in a conference) can speak only after acquiring the floor. To allow impromptu speech, <b>floor</b> <b>allocation</b> must be made for many concurrent speakers. However, too many concurrent speakers degrade voice intelligibility. Therefore, setting an upper bound {{for the number of}} streams (floors) that may be mixed is sine qua non for quality conferencing. The problem of setting an upper bound on the number of floors to support concurrent multi-party audio sessions is addressed. A conjecture based on conversational and qualitative analysis is proposed. A pseudo-measure termed ‘loudness number ’ used to manage the number of floors is briefly outlined. The implementation at a functional level on Windowsr systems has yielded satisfactory performance. ...|$|E

Heterogeneous market-based coordination mechanism is proposed {{as an alternative to}} the traditional centralized planning and control scheme. Agent technology is combined with a market approach to support factory <b>floor</b> resource <b>allocation.</b> The market operating protocol, bidding mechanism, commitment mechanism, pricing policy, and the overall system architecture and performance are studied...|$|R
40|$|This study {{brings up}} the {{importance}} of using the store environment {{as a tool for}} creating positive consumer experiences. It compares two consumer shopping motives, hedonic (related to sensations and fun) and utilitarian (related to fulfilling a task). The atmospheric variables that the environment consists of are discussed and found to be affecting these two consumer groups in different ways. The study takes a quantitative approach for investigating how these two consumer types are affected by the store environment. Hedonic and utilitarian consumers are then compared {{to see if there are}} any differences in how these consumers experience the store environment. The findings show that there are no differences in what atmospherics that are liked more by a hedonic compared to a utilitarian shopper. However, atmospherics are found to be more memorable for hedonic consumers. Hedonic consumers are also found to like being in the store more when signs are clear, and when it is easy to find departments, fitting rooms and cash registers. The results also showed that to make hedonic customers revisit the store, retailers should focus on the style of the store, <b>floor</b> space <b>allocation,</b> product presentation, sound level, lighting and the interior material. To make utilitarian revisit the store, retailers should focus on atmospherics such as architecture, the cleanliness, <b>floor</b> space <b>allocation,</b> product presentation, <b>flooring,</b> color scheme of the store and the interior material...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Four limited-area {{brooding}} {{systems were}} compared to full-house brooding to deter-mine the effect on growth rate, feed conversion, and mortality. The limited-area brooding systems evaluated were: 1) half-house, 2) third-house, 3) quarter-house for initial brooding followed by half-house for second brooding stage, and 4) quarter-house with wire floor for initial brooding followed by half-house with litter for second stage. <b>Floor</b> space <b>allocations</b> in the limited areas were determined by multiplying the area allocation at market age by {{the ratio of the}} time in the limited area to the total growing time. There {{were no significant differences in}} growth rate or feed conversion at market age among the brooding systems evaluated. Mortalities for the conventional full-house system, and the quarter-house system with wire floor were significantly greater than for the third-house system and quarter-house system with litter...|$|R

There are at least 56 rooms in each hostels and each room {{have the capacity}} to house 8 students. There are two restrooms in each <b>floors.</b> The room <b>allocations</b> are according to levels and houses. The prefects would get a whole floor to themselves {{and the rest of the}} students would be distributed according to their houses.

40|$|Nowadays most {{industries}} do not integrate product, {{process and}} energy data. Costs due to energy consumption are often considered externalities and energy efficiency is not deemed a relevant performance criterion. In energy-intensive processes, as injection moulding, the specific energy consumption, embedded inside the same products, {{depends on the}} machine–product combinations. Multi-objective scheduling, including the energy data acquired from shop <b>floor</b> and <b>allocation</b> criteria, is a valuable approach to improve energy efficiency. This paper presents the extension of a commercial detailed scheduling support system developed within a regional Italian project aiming at providing tools to manufacturing industry for improving energy efficiency. The project designed a monitoring system developed by instrumenting injection moulding presses to acquire the energy consumption for each product–machine combination. The commercial scheduling system was extended by implementing a multi-objective metaheuristic scheduling approach. The experimental assessment of the proposed approach involved a major producer of plastic dispensers. The extended algorithm simultaneously optimizes the total weighted tardiness, the total setup and the energy consumption costs. The obtained results, produced for a real test case {{and a set of}} random generated instances, show the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: As {{information}} and communications technology matures, {{the nature of}} the infrastructure that supports it evolves and specializes. While the telephone infrastructure had been built as a network with central offices acting as hubs, the {{information and}} communications technology maintains a similar structure, but instead, has hubs of specialized Internet data centers which house the routers and servers. This paper updates one of the first studies to document the electricity consumption and power distribution within an Internet data center. For this study, electricity billing data, metering data, and facility <b>floor</b> space <b>allocation</b> data were used to calculate computer room, total computer room, and building power densities for July 2002. The results of this 2002 study indicate that although the data center had expanded its operations by roughly 33 % from the previous year and increased the electricity demand associated with the computer equipment by 55 %, the total computer room power density �which includes cooling and auxiliary equipment � remained the same as the previous year at 355 W/m 2. The facility’s efforts to improve energy efficiency offset the energy demand from an increased, electrically active, computer room area. The energy-efficiency measures included better optimization of power distribution units, power management modules, computer room air-conditioning units, alterations to operating conditions, facilitywide reductions in lighting, and improved facility controls. A key recommendation is to expand this research to address the need to develop metrics to capture the energy efficiency of the data network throughput...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we design}} a {{low-power}} 32 bit datapath with a five-stage pipeline for a single-issue MIPS RISC microprocessor. We compare various designs of flipflops, latches, and muxes {{in terms of}} power, delay, and PDP (Power-Delay Product) since {{they are the most}} common building blocks in the datapath. We develop new precise analytic energy models for flipflops, latches, and muxes. We develop a new simulation-based energy model, the net-transition energy model,to calculate energy consumption quickly and accurately. The energy model combines effective capacitance values extracted from layout and transition counts obtained from a simulator to estimate energy dissipation. We build a capacitance merging method to extract precise effective capacitance values from layouts. Also, we model the short-circuit energy for an inverter. We custom-design the prototype datapath for a 0. 25 #m TSMC process. We show design decisions on metal <b>allocation,</b> <b>floor</b> planning, and an adder [...] - one of the mo [...] ...|$|R
