5|$|Grünschloß speculates the UFO-contact {{narratives}} {{may have}} played a role in the group's development of space opera, specifically citing the resemblance of Hubbard's description of life in Xenu's time to statements by George Adamski, a UFO contactee of the 1950s. Rothstein notes the group's teachings about extraterrestrials varies <b>greatly</b> <b>from</b> most of the UFO movement, particularly in Hubbard's descriptions of demonic characters.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activities}} have had {{positive effects on}} some species of cockatoo and negative effects on others. Many species of open country have benefited <b>greatly</b> <b>from</b> anthropogenic changes to the landscape, with the great increase in reliable seed food sources, available water and have also adapted well to a diet including foreign foodstuffs. This benefit appears to be restricted to Australian species, as cockatoos favouring open country outside Australia have not become more abundant. Predominantly forest-dwelling species have suffered <b>greatly</b> <b>from</b> habitat destruction; in the main, {{they appear to have}} a more specialised diet and {{have not been able to}} incorporate exotic food into their diet. A notable exception is the yellow-tailed black cockatoo in eastern Australia.|$|E

Living things as machines became a dominant metaphor in biological (and social) thinking.|$|E
5|$|According to Sorkin, {{the episode}} benefited <b>greatly</b> <b>from</b> input by two former White House employees. The scene where Donna stays {{up all night}} sorting through {{documents}} in cartons {{was the idea of}} Eli Attie, Al Gore's chief speechwriter. Meanwhile Gene Sperling, Bill Clinton's chief economic adviser, came up with the sub-plot involving the estate tax. Sorkin, however, had certain misgivings about the estate tax story's appeal, considering the prevalent bipartisan spirit of the time, {{in the aftermath of the}} 9/11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|Basil cultivars vary {{in several}} ways. Visually, {{the size and}} shape of the leaves varies <b>greatly,</b> <b>from</b> the large lettuce-like leaves of the Mammoth basil and Lettuce leaf basil to the tiny leaves of the Dwarf bush basil. More practically, the {{fragrance}} of the basil varies due to the varying types and quantities of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.|$|E

5|$|Because {{strontium}} is {{so similar}} to calcium, it {{is incorporated in}} the bone. All four stable isotopes are incorporated, in roughly the same proportions they are found in nature. However, the actual distribution of the isotopes tends to vary <b>greatly</b> <b>from</b> one geographical location to another. Thus, analyzing the bone of an individual can help determine the region it came from. This approach helps to identify the ancient migration patterns and the origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites.|$|E
5|$|Between World WarI and World WarII Australia {{suffered}} <b>greatly</b> <b>from</b> the Great Depression {{which started}} in 1929. This limited Australian defence expenditure {{and led to a}} decline in the size and effectiveness of the armed forces during the 1930s. In 1931, the Statute of Westminster granted the Australian government independence in foreign affairs and defence. Nevertheless, from the mid-1930s, Australian governments generally followed British policy towards Nazi Germany, supporting first the appeasement of Hitler and the British guarantee of Polish independence.|$|E
5|$|During the {{formation}} of the Soviet state, in the late 1910s and early 1920s, the People's Commissariat for Finance of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) was created. The commissariat did not differ <b>greatly</b> <b>from</b> that of Imperial Russia's Ministry of Finance and its system. The Soviet finance ministry was a heavily centralised structure, while its predecessor was not. During its humble beginnings, the main task of the People's Commissariat of Finance were: confiscation of property, robbery and requisition; printing and creating money; and taxation.|$|E

5|$|Even with Lancaster defeated, {{the battle}} against the rebels was not over. Edmund was charged with {{overtaking}} Wallingford Castle from Maurice de Berkeley in January 1323, a task which he fulfilled with great success. For his loyalty, Edmund was rewarded with substantial holdings in Wales, primarily land forfeited by Roger Mortimer. The greater part of the spoils of war, however, went to the Despensers, who both benefited <b>greatly</b> <b>from</b> the forfeiture of the rebels. By 1326, the Despensers, father and son respectively, enjoyed incomes of £3,800 and £7,000, while Edmund's annual income was at only 2,355 marks (£1,570).|$|E

5|$|Hawkins benefited <b>greatly</b> <b>from</b> the public's {{reaction}} to the dinosaurs, which was so strong it allowed {{for the sale of}} sets of small versions of the dinosaur models, priced at £30 for educational use. But the building of the models was costly (having cost around £13,729) and in 1855, the Crystal Palace Company cut Hawkins's funding. Several planned models were never made, while those half finished were scrapped, despite protest from sources including the Sunday newspaper, The Observer.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Whitlock et al. {{described}} a juvenile skull {{at the time}} referred to Diplodocus (CM11255) that differed <b>greatly</b> <b>from</b> adult skulls of the same genus: its snout was not blunt, and the teeth were {{not confined to the}} front of the snout. These differences suggest that adults and juveniles were feeding differently. Such an ecological difference between adults and juveniles had not been previously observed in sauropodomorphs.|$|E
5|$|In 886 Alfred took {{possession}} of London, which had suffered <b>greatly</b> <b>from</b> several Viking occupations; {{as it had}} traditionally been a Mercian town, he handed control to Æthelred. In 892 the Vikings renewed their attacks, and the following year Æthelred led an army of Mercians, West Saxons and Welsh to victory over a Viking army at the Battle of Buttington. He spent {{the next three years}} fighting them alongside Alfred's son, the future King Edward the Elder. At some time in the decade 899 to 909, Æthelred's health may have declined, and Æthelflæd may have become the effective ruler of Mercia.|$|E
