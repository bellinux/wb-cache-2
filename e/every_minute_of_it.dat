[...] Likewise, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B−" [...] grade and said, [...] "The Mummy {{would like to make}} you shudder, but it tries to do so without ever letting go of its jocular inconsequentiality." [...] Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film high marks for the acting as well as the special effects.|$|E

Cameron Adams for the Herald Sun called the episode hilarious, while The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert {{felt that it was}} flaccid and cliched. IGN contributor Robert Canning said that the episode [...] "did have its moments" [...] and that the storylines [...] "had their potential, and their share of laughs, but I can't help but feel they both could have been so much more." [...] He opined that the Kenneth and Tracy story was [...] "more up 30 Rocks style" [...] but that it was a shame that the story could not [...] "quite knock the concept out of the park." [...] Overall, Canning rated [...] "The One with the Cast of Night Court" [...] a 7.9 out of 10. Jeff Labrecque for Entertainment Weekly reported that the episode fell flat.|$|E

50|$|Hjalmarsson {{became a}} key part of the Blackhawks' lineup late into the 2008-09 season and to begin the 2009-10 season. In 2009-10, he played 77 games in the regular season and all 22 in the Stanley Cup playoffs for the team, {{averaging}} over 19 minutes played per game, switching between the second and third defensive pairings. Over that time, he recorded a production value (PROD) of a point roughly <b>every</b> 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> while his season PROD was 89 minutes. During the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs, a slapshot Hjalmarsson took was redirected by teammate Andrew Ladd to give Chicago a 3-2 lead in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals; the team won the game in overtime, 4-3, and eventually the 2010 Stanley Cup.|$|R
5000|$|Further, Johnny's early {{adulthood}} {{was marked by}} bouts of delinquency which he attested were inexplicable at the time.

Just being bad <b>every</b> <b>minute</b> <b>of</b> the day. <b>It</b> was terrible. I don't know what my problem was. Things that were funny {{to me at the}} time were horrible. If I found a television set sitting in the garbage, I'd take it up to the rooftop, watch for someone walking down the block and drop <b>it</b> in front <b>of</b> them on the sidewalk. It was funny watching them see a TV set come crashing down 30 feet in front of them. To me it was hysterical, {{but it was also a}} mean and terrible thing to do. I also found a way of stopping the elevator. I could open up the door and stop the elevator. I would wait for an old lady to get in and stop the elevator. They'd be yelling and pushing the alarm, and I would keep them there. At about 20 years old, I stopped drinking and doing drugs, got a job and tried to be normal." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the disappointing results, Israel {{received}} something of a consolation prize, as the country swept the Eurovision-sanctioned 2010 Marcel Bezençon Awards, winning for best artist, best composition, and best entry of the contest. It {{is the first time}} in the history of the awards, which are selected by the contest's accredited media and press, participating composers, and commentators that a single country has won more than one award in the same year. [...] At the end of the Eurovision contest, Skaat expressed pride and gratitude. He told one reporter, [...] "I’m proud and happy over the performance and for representing [...] “We brought Israel artistic accolades. It was a fun experience and I enjoyed <b>every</b> <b>minute</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> After all, it’s just sports.” While Christer Björkman, a founder of the Marcel Bezençon Awards, stated, [...] "The awards given to the Israeli entry show a virtue of the prize.

This song is very beautiful, and we've been here two weeks now, but it might be that this song doesn't reach out in the same way the first time you hear it".|$|E
2500|$|Mike Love said [...] "some of {{the words}} were so totally {{offensive}} to me that I wouldn't even sing 'em because I thought it was too nauseating." [...] The original lyrics of [...] "I Know There's an Answer", known as [...] "Hang On to Your Ego", created a stir within the group. He opposed the song's original message, though Jardine recalled {{that the decision to}} change the lyrics was ultimately Brian's: [...] "Brian was very concerned. He wanted to know what we thought about it. To be honest, I don't think we even knew what an ego was... Finally Brian decided, 'Forget it. I'm changing the lyrics. There's too much controversy.'" [...] On Love's reaction to the album, Jardine commented: [...] "Mike was very confused... Mike's a formula hound – if it doesn't have a hook in it, if he can't hear a hook in it, he doesn't want to know about it.... I wasn't exactly thrilled with the change, but I grew to really appreciate it as soon as we started to work on it. It wasn't like anything we'd heard before." [...] Carl Wilson said: [...] "I loved <b>every</b> <b>minute</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> He [...] could do no wrong. He could play me anything, and I would love it." [...] Brian remembers that Carl was enthused with the album, but not Dennis and Mike.

2500|$|The {{game was}} given {{generally}} favorable reviews, receiving around an 82.68% on GameRankings. [...] GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{commented on the}} game's sound, graphics and originality and gave it an 8.4, stating, [...] "While the game isn't a strict sequel, it does {{take place in the}} same universe, with the same graphics style and nearly identical gameplay. ... he additional levels, the two-player option, and the inclusion of the Parappa remixes in Um Jammer Lammy add a value that Parappa the Rapper simply can't touch. But {{keep in mind that the}} game doesn't stray far from the formula, and the game's difficulty will put off those who never mastered Parappa. So, to put it another way, if you didn't play Parappa to death and love <b>every</b> <b>minute</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> you might as well skip out on Um Jammer Lammy." [...] Similarly, IGN gave it an 8.6 and commented on the gameplay, story, graphics and sound, stating, [...] "If you can look past all the crazy effects and wild animations, the plot isn't as funny, or as cute, as Parappa the Rapper's. In fact, it was kind of bland. ... But the rest of the game is sweet. ... Um Jammer Lammy is a great addition to the Parappa cosmos... has so much more that Parappa didn't have." [...] Game Revolution also gave it a B, calling it [...] "a cool game, if for no other reason than to entertain sufficiently inebriated party guests. It's easily the most insane mish-mash of psychadelia [...] yet seen on a console, and at least deserves a shot (or the whole bottle, even)", but criticized the story, calling it [...] "the most obtuse, disjointed, drug-induced mess of a story that has ever been conceived, period."

5000|$|Harvey {{moved to}} Canberra in 1960 and became {{involved}} in playing, coaching and administrative roles in basketball. In 1967, he {{played a major role}} in the Australian Capital Territory breaking away from New South Wales basketball. In 1979, he was involved with the establishment of the Canberra Cannons basketball team and between 1981 and 1986 acted as the club's chairman and general manager. He was the National Basketball League(NBL) chairman from 1983 to 1987. He left this position in 1987, when appointed the third Director of the Australian Institute of Sport. His time at the AIS was challenging on two fronts, due to the merger of the AIS with the Australian Sports Commission with the latter organisation taking responsibility for federal government administration of sport. Shortly after his arrival at the AIS, there was a Senate inquiry into drugs in sport which examined allegations against AIS staff and athletes. After leaving the Australian Sports Commission as Executive Director in 1989, he became Chief Executive Officer of the Gold Goast Cougars NBL team until 1991. [...] In 1993, he was appointed a member of the Australian Olympic Committee's board and was Vice President from 2001 to 2013. [...] In 1997, he was President of Basketball Australia. From 2004 to 2007, he was a Director of Football Federation Australia. He organised the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games torch relay leg in Australia. In 2009, he was the second Australian to be awarded the International Olympic Committee's Pierre de Coubertin medal in recognition to his contribution to the promotion of the Olympic spirit. In receiving the award Harvey commented [...] "I have enjoyed <b>every</b> <b>minute</b> <b>of</b> my involvement. <b>It</b> has been a fantastic continuing journey. The athletes make you proud to be an Australian and make all your efforts worthwhile." [...] Also in 2009, he was appointed one of the chief envoys of Australia's FIFA 2018-2022 World Cup bid.|$|R

Sometimes the road went through woods where maples were beginning to hang out scarlet banners; sometimes it crossed rivers on bridges that made Anne's flesh cringe with the old, half-delightful fear; sometimes it wound along a harbor shore and passed by a little cluster of weather-gray fishing huts; again it mounted to hills whence a far sweep of curving upland or misty-blue sky could be seen; but wherever it went there was much of interest to discuss. It was almost noon when they reached town and {{found their way to}} [...] "Beechwood."

Rilla had lived through the days of his absence on the hope of that week, and now that it had come she drank <b>every</b> <b>minute</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> thirstily, hating even the hours she had to spend in sleep, they seemed such a waste of {{precious}} moments. In spite of its sadness, {{it was a beautiful}} week, full of poignant, unforgettable hours, when she and Walter had long walks and talks and silences together. He was all her own and she knew that he found strength and comfort in her sympathy and understanding. It was very wonderful to know she meant so much to him--the knowledge helped her through moments that would otherwise have been unendurable, and gave her power to smile--and even to laugh a little. When Walter had gone she might indulge in the comfort of tears, but not while he was here. She would not even let herself cry at night, lest her eyes should betray her to him in the morning.|$|E

All--all seemed ended for her. That interminable story! It had taken so long. And <b>every</b> <b>minute</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> she had been helplessly torn asunder by feelings she had never known she possessed. This Ellen Jorth was an unknown creature. She sobbed now as she dragged the burro down the canyon trail. She sat down only to rise. She hurried only to stop. Driven, pursued, barred, she had no way to escape the flaying thoughts, no time or will to repudiate them. The death of her girlhood, the rending aside of a veil of maiden mystery only vaguely instinctively guessed, the barren, sordid truth of her life as seen by her enlightened eyes, the bitter realization of the vileness of men of her clan in contrast to the manliness and chivalry of an enemy, the hard facts of unalterable repute as created by slander and fostered by low minds, all these were forces in a cataclysm that had suddenly caught her heart and whirled her through changes immense and agonizing, to bring her face to face with reality, to force upon her suspicion and doubt of all she had trusted, to warn her of the dark, impending horror of a tragic bloody feud, and lastly to teach her the supreme truth at once so glorious and so terrible--that she could not escape the doom of womanhood.|$|E
