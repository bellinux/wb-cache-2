The algorithm correctly restores a mutilated signal that is indeed band-limited.

50|$|In signal {{acquisition}} and audio, anti-aliasing is often done using an analogue anti-aliasing filter {{to remove the}} <b>out-of-band</b> <b>component</b> of the input signal prior to sampling with an analogue-to-digital converter. In digital photography, optical anti-aliasing filters are made of birefringent materials, and smooth the signal in the spatial optical domain. The anti-aliasing filter essentially blurs the image slightly {{in order to reduce}} the resolution to or below that achievable by the digital sensor (the larger the pixel pitch, the lower the achievable resolution at the sensor level).|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{synthesis}} method for suspended substrate stripline filters for digital microwave power amplifier applications is presented. The synthesis method combines a lumped element and full-wave mixed approach {{in a very}} efficient way. In order to achieve high amplifier efficiency the filter must exhibit a high input impedance in the stopband. This has been implemented {{for the first time}} by using a capacitively end coupled filter combined with stepped impedance resonators. A third order filter was designed.

40|$|Current {{electromagnetic}} immunity tests mainly rely on single-frequency sources. However, {{the evolution of}} electronic systems leads to miniaturisation and low-cost solutions, in which filters are omitted in front of active non-linear components, also for efficiency reasons. As a result, intermodulation products may leak into the band of operation. The authors propose a comprehensive strategy consisting of design and test methodologies to evaluate in-the-band leakage of <b>out-of-band</b> undesired <b>components,</b> using multiple-tone excitation and relying on an anechoic chamber as test facility.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{introduces}} {{a class of}} efficient linear-phase FIR decimators for attenuating the out-of-band noise generated by a high-order sigma-delta analog-to-digital modulator. The stopband attenuation of these decimators is more than 120 dB. The decimators contain no generd multipliers and a few data memory locations. thereby making them easily VLSI-realizable. This is achieved by using several decimation stages with each stage containing {{a small number of}} delays and arithmetic operations. Some of the stages have been constructed using low-order building blocks which are combined to give a selective filter using a few additional tap coefficients and adders. The output sampling rate of these decimators is the minimum possible one and the proposed decimators can be used. with very slight changes. for many oversampling ratios. hithermore. these deciniators attenuate highly the undesired <b>out-of-band</b> signal <b>components</b> of the input signal. thus significantly relaxing the anti-aliasing prefilter requirements.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{simultaneously}} enhancing both horizontal and vertical resolution of analog-to-digital converters, with specific regard to low-cost conversion systems. To this aim, the authors propose the combined exploitation of a suitable Compressive Sampling (CS) approach and a proper digital signal processing stage. In particular, starting from a reduced number of digitized samples, the proposed CS-based sampling approach allows to recover an oversampled version of the input signal, whose spectral content is properly shaped to reject the most of in-band noise. The successive processing stage, implementing a low-pass filter, is mandated to drastically attenuate <b>out-of-band</b> noise <b>components.</b> Tests carried out on an actual microcontroller (namely, PIC 32 MX 360 L 512 by Microchip) evidence the promising performance of the proposed sampling strategy. Results obtained either on single tone or multisine signals highlight a gain up to 3. 5 bits in vertical resolution, while the sample rate increases 50 times with respect to the actual one adopted to randomly sample the input signal of interest. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|Although {{there are}} some reports [2] that {{introduce}} measurement-while-drilling tools, and enormous literatures on signal processing in other fields such as geophysics, medical imaging, vibration studies, etc., however, there are few literatures that introduce data or signal processing techniques for a measurement-while-drilling system in petroleum engineering. A measurement-while-drilling system based on a microcontroller is developed in [3]. The data come from different down-hole sensors such as three-axe accelerometers, magnetometers, gamma-ray detector, resistivity detector, and other sensors. Ledroz et al. [4] and Pecht et al. [5] use a fiber-optic-gyroscope-based inertial measurement unit in gyroscope aims. Wavelet transform in [6] is used {{to get rid of}} high-frequency noise from the contaminated data. In [7] and [8], a limited impulse response low-pass filter is used as a DC (direct current) estimator, and a band-pass filter is used to eliminate the large <b>out-of-band</b> noise <b>components</b> caused by the mud pumps, and at last a zero mean signal is acquired. In [9], we propose a two-step filtering method in which a dynamic part mean filtering algorithm is proposed to separate the direct current components and a windowed limited impulse response algorithm is used to filter out the high-frequency noise.|$|R
50|$|Non-Gaussian {{statistics}} arise {{due to the}} nonlinear {{mapping of}} random initial conditions into output states. For example, modulation instability amplifies input noise, which ultimately leads to soliton formation. Also, in systems displaying heavy-tailed statistical properties, random input conditions often enter through a seemingly insignificant, nontrivial, or otherwise-hidden variable. Such is generally the case for optical rogue waves; for example, they can begin from a specific <b>out-of-band</b> noise <b>component,</b> which is usually very weak and unnoticed. Yet, in the output states, these minor input variations can be magnified into large potential swings in key observables. The latter may, therefore, exhibit substantial fluctuations for no readily apparent reason. Thus, the appearance of extreme statistics is often striking {{not only because of}} their counterintuitive probability assignments, but also because they frequently signify a nontrivial or unexpected sensitivity to initial conditions. It {{is important to recognize that}} rogue waves in both optics and hydrodynamics are classical phenomena and, therefore, intrinsically deterministic. However, determinism does not necessarily indicate that it is straightforward or practical to make useful predictions. Optical rogue waves and their statistical properties can be investigated in numerical simulations with the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation, a classical propagation equation that is also used to model supercontinuum generation and, more generally, pulse propagation in optical fiber. In such simulations, a source of input noise is needed to produce the stochastic output variations. Frequently, input phase noise with a power amplitude of one photon per mode is employed, corresponding to shot noise. Yet, noise levels beyond the one-photon-per-mode level are generally more experimentally realistic and often needed.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to analyze and improve linearity of envelope elimination and restoration (EER) radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers. Envelope elimination and restoration was compared to other efficiency enhancement techniques and determined to likely be the most suitable solution for implementation of multimode, multiband portable RF transmitters. Distortion, stemming from dynamic power-supply modulation of RF transistors in EER RF power amplifiers was identified as one of the key challenges to the development of commercially viable EER transmitters. This dissertation presents a study of phase distortion in RF power amplifiers (PAs) with emphasis on identification of the origins of phase distortion in EER RF power amplifiers. Circuit-level techniques for distortion mitigation are also presented. Memory effects in conventional power amplifiers are investigated through the accurate measurement and analysis of phase asymmetry of <b>out-of-band</b> distortion <b>components.</b> Novel physically-based power amplifier model is developed for attributing measured memory effects to their physical origin. The amount of linearity correction, obtained through pre-distortion for a particular RF power amplifier, is then correlated to the behavior of the memory effects in the corresponding PA. Heterojunction field-effect transistor and heterojunction bipolar transistor amplifiers are used for investigation of voltage-dependent phase distortion in handset EER RF PAs. The distortion is found to stem from vector addition of signals, generated in nonlinear circuit elements of the PA. Specifically, nonlinear base-collector capacitance and downconversion of distortion components from second harmonic frequency are found to be the dominant sources of phase distortion. Shorting of second harmonic is proposed as a way to reduce the distortion contribution of the downconverted signal. Phase distortion is reduced by 50 %, however a slight degradation in the amplitude distortion is observed. Push-pull architecture is proposed for EER RF power amplifiers to cancel distortion components, generated in the nonlinear base-collector capacitance. Push-pull implementation enables a 67 % reduction in phase distortion, accompanied by a 1 - 2 dB reduction in amplitude distortion in EER RF power amplifiers. This work, combined with other studies in the field, will help advance the development of multimode, multiband portable RF transmitters, based on the envelope elimination and restoration architecture.
