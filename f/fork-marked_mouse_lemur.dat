50|$|Gerp's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> weighs around 68 g {{and has a}} {{tail length}} of {{approximately}} 146.5 mm. It is a large-bodied <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> and belongs {{to a group of}} large <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> (weighing more than 50 g), including four eastern species—Simmons' <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> Jolly's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> the northern rufous <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. tavaratra), and MacArthur's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. macarthurii)—as well as six species of western mouse lemur: Claire's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. mamiratra), Danfoss' <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. danfossi), the Bongolava <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. bongolavensis), the golden-brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. ravelobensis), the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. murinus), and the reddish-gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. griseorufus). Most of these larger <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> species have a long tail, as does Gerp's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> with the exception of Jolly's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> and the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur.</b> Its ears are small (measuring 19 to 20 mm), which conforms with that of other rainforest <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> species, in contrast to larger-eared <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> of the dry, western forests (averaging 21 to 24 mm). As with all <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs,</b> no body mass differences could be discerned between the sexes. However, larger samples are needed to confirm this.|$|R

[...] The female Marohita <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> were 20% heavier than the heaviest female <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs,</b> which belonged to the Simmons' <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> and Gerp's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> species.|$|R
50|$|The brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (Microcebus rufus) {{is a small}} primate, {{and like}} the other <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> can only {{be found on the}} island of Madagascar. They are known also as the rufous <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> eastern rufous <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> red <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> or russet <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur.</b> Its dorsal side is brown or reddish-brown, while ventrally it is a whitish-grey.|$|R
25|$|A study led by Edward Louis, a {{conservation}} geneticist at the zoo, identified three new <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> (Simmons' <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> Mittermeier's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> and Jolly's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur)</b> {{with the first}} named after Lee Simmons, the zoo's director.|$|R
50|$|The Marohita <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> {{has only}} {{been found in the}} Marohita Forest, located within the more {{extensive}} Marolambo Forest. Its distribution outside of Marohita Forest is unknown. Four other <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> species have been found nearby: the highland species, Goodman's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> and the lowland species, Gerp's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> both described less than ten years earlier, are found north of the Mangoro River, while Jolly's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. jollyae) and the brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> are found south of Marolambo.|$|R
500|$|As {{its name}} implies, the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> is a lemur, {{a type of}} primate, and belongs to the {{suborder}} Strepsirrhini and infraorder Lemuriformes. [...] Within Lemuriformes, {{it belongs to the}} family Cheirogaleidae, which contains the <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs,</b> dwarf <b>lemurs,</b> giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs,</b> <b>fork-marked</b> lemurs, and hairy-eared dwarf <b>lemur.</b> [...] The <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> genus Microcebus includes the smallest primates in the world. [...] Phylogenetic analyses of D-loop DNA sequences of various lemur species suggest that the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> may be most closely related to the reddish-gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M.griseorufus).|$|R

50|$|MacArthur's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (Microcebus macarthurii), or the Anjiahely <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> is {{a species}} of <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> known only from Makira Natural Park in northeastern Madagascar.|$|R
500|$|The gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (Microcebus murinus), grey <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> {{or lesser}} <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> {{is a small}} lemur, a type of strepsirrhine primate, found only {{on the island of}} Madagascar. Weighing , it is the largest of the <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> (genus Microcebus), a group that {{includes}} the smallest primates in the world. [...] The species is named for its mouse-like size and coloration and is known locally (in Malagasy) as tsidy, koitsiky, titilivaha, pondiky, and vakiandry. [...] The gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> and all other <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> are considered cryptic species, as they are nearly indistinguishable from each other by appearance. [...] For this reason, the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> was considered the only <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> species for decades until more recent studies began to distinguish between the species.|$|R
500|$|The {{limits of}} the {{distribution}} are poorly understood. [...] It is believed to range from the Onilahy River or Lake Tsimanampetsotsa {{in the south to}} Ankarafantsika National Park in the north. There is also an isolated and disjointed population in the southeastern part of the island, near Tôlanaro and the Andohahela National Park, up to the Mandena Conservation Zone. Individuals tend to occupy small home ranges of [...] [...] The gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> is also sympatric with the reddish-gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> golden-brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> Madame Berthe's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> and several other cheirogaleid lemurs. [...] In Ankarafantsika National Park, where it coexists with the golden-brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur's</b> relative population density was highest at higher altitudes and in drier habitat, while the golden-brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> preferred the opposite. [...] Another study has looked at the coexistence of the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> and Madame Berthe's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> and found small, exclusive clusters of each species and a high degree of feeding niche overlap.|$|R
50|$|The {{reason for}} the lemur’s {{avoidance}} is not yet clearly known. The gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> has several competitive advantages over Madame Berthe’s <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur.</b> It is about {{twice as large as}} Madame Berthe's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur.</b> It also has the advantages of being a generalist, and having fewer deaths by predation (with 70% predation mortality for Madame Berthe’s <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> vs. 50% predation mortality for the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur).</b> The areas used exclusively by each species share structural characteristics and food sources. Gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> are able to live in more types of vegetation than Madame Berthe’s <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> yet have smaller, denser territories. This suggests that their avoidance does not stem from environmental differences, but rather by competitive coexistence.|$|R
50|$|Based on genetic studies, measurements, and photos, the {{research}} team confirmed the Gerp's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> was an undescribed species, distinct from Goodman's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> which is found 58 km away. Gerp's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> is significantly larger, weighing on average 68 g, compared to Goodman's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> which weighs about 44 g. Jolly's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> which is its closest relative and a neighbor to the south, is comparably larger, but differs in tail length and genetics.|$|R
50|$|The reddish-gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (Microcebus griseorufus) {{also known}} as the gray-brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> or rufous-gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> is found in Western Madagascar in the region around Beza Mahafaly Reserve, north to Lamboharana.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> have a {{combined}} head, body and tail length {{of less than}} 27 cm, making them the smallest primates (the smallest species being Madame Berthe's mouse lemur); however, their weight fluctuates in response to daylight duration. <b>Lemurs</b> and <b>Mouse</b> <b>Lemurs</b> were announced by the IUCN as the most endangered of all vertebrates. There are about 24 <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> species identified by 2016. There were only 2 known <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> species by 1992. It was estimated that the 24 <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> species evolved from a common ancestor 10 million years ago. Evolution of <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> is an example for adaptive radiation.|$|R
50|$|The {{discovery}} {{was published in}} the journal Primates in 2012. The species was named after the research and conservation team that described it. Gerp's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> differed genetically and physically from all of its nearest neighboring <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> species. Its tail is longer than its closest relative, Jolly's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. jollyae), which lives further south and whose tail is 18% shorter. It also has a higher body mass (68 g) and is generally larger than Goodman's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. lehilahytsara), which weighs about 44 g. Gerp's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> exhibits significant genetic differences from its northern neighbor, Simmons' <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. simmonsi).|$|R
50|$|Arnhold's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> or the Montagne d'Ambre <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (Microcebus arnholdi) is {{a species}} of <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> endemic to Madagascar. Its holotype was first {{collected}} on 27 November 2005, and was first described in 2008. According to genetic tests, it is genetically distinct from its closest sister taxa, the Sambirano <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. sambiranensis).|$|R
50|$|Among lemurs, {{females of}} smaller species, {{such as the}} <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> and giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> build leaf nests before birth for the {{protection}} of young. Leaf nests in golden-brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> may provide thermoregulation benefits. Male <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> have been found sharing nests with up to seven females at a time during the mating season.|$|R
5|$|Like other <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs,</b> {{the gray}} <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> uses {{what has been}} {{described}} as a harmonic whistle call that is lower in frequency and shorter in duration than its close relative, the brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur.</b> In addition, it has been found that the types of vocalizations emitted by the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> can be dependent upon the environment. In the more open dry forest habitats favored by the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> trill calls are more common and effective since they carry faster and are less likely to be masked by the wind, while chirp calls are more common in the brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> which favors closed rain forest habitats.|$|R
50|$|The golden-brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (Microcebus ravelobensis), {{also known}} as the Lac Ravelobe <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> or the Ravelobe <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> is part of the family, Cheirogaleidae. These are the {{smallest}} species of lemur and are all arboreal, nocturnal, and typically social. All species of Lemur are native to the island of Madagascar. The golden-brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> Microcebus ravelobensis, was first discovered in 1994.|$|R
5000|$|Danfoss' <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (Microcebus danfossi), or the Ambarijeby <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> is {{a species}} of <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> endemic to Madagascar. It lives in western {{deciduous}} forest within a limited range between the Sofia River and the Maevarano River. [...] It is a relatively large reddish <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> with a total length of 25 to 29 centimeters, including 15 to 17 centimeters of tail.|$|R
500|$|First {{described}} in 1777 by English illustrator John Frederick Miller, M.murinus remained the only species of its genus, {{as well as}} the name used for all <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> on Madagascar, between the first major taxonomic revision in 1931 and an extensive field study conducted in 1972. [...] The field study distinguished the brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> M.rufus—then considered a subspecies—as a distinct, sympatric species in the southeastern part of the island. [...] Upon this revision, the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> was thought to account for all <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> that lived in the drier parts of the north, west, and south, while the brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> represented the eastern rainforest <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs.</b> [...] More recently, scientific understanding of the distribution and diversity of the <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> has become much more complex. [...] Additional field studies, genetic testing, and resulting taxonomic revisions throughout the 1990s and 2000s identified numerous new <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> species, demonstrating that the genus includes at least 17 cryptic species.|$|R
50|$|Margot Marsh's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> or the Antafondro <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (Microcebus margotmarshae) is {{a species}} of <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> endemic to Madagascar. Its holotype was first {{collected}} on 21 May 2006, proposed in 2006 by Andriantompohavana et al., and was formally described in 2008 by E. Lewis, Jr., et al. According to genetic tests, it is genetically distinct from its closest sister taxon, Claire's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. mamiratra).|$|R
50|$|<b>Mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> {{are among}} the {{smallest}} primates, and Goodman’s <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> is no exception. Although not the smallest overall, Goodman’s <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> has a head-body length comparable to M. berthae which is the smallest known primate. The average size ranges from 45-48 grams, with males being slightly larger than females. Goodman’s <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> is mainly maroon with a white underbelly and orange tint on their backs.|$|R
5|$|Giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> {{are often}} {{sympatric}} with <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs,</b> such as M.murinus, {{though they are}} typically found higher in the canopy and favor thicker, taller gallery forests. At the Marosalaza forest (north of Morondava), Coquerel's giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> is sympatric with four other nocturnal <b>lemurs</b> (<b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs,</b> sportive lemurs, dwarf lemurs, and fork-marked lemurs), but manages niche differentiation by feeding at different times and specializing on insect secretions during the dry season.|$|R
5|$|Crypsis, or the {{inability}} of humans to visually distinguish between two or more distinct species, has recently been discovered among lemurs, particularly within the sportive <b>lemurs</b> (Lepilemur) and <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> (Microcebus). With sportive lemurs, subspecies were traditionally defined based on slight morphological differences, but new genetic evidence has supported giving full species status to these regional populations. In the case of <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs,</b> the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. murinus), golden-brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. ravelobensis), and Goodman's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. lehilahytsara) were considered the same species until recently, when genetic tests identified them as cryptic species.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} end of Margot Marsh's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur's</b> range is bordered by {{the range of the}} Sambirano <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. sambiranensis), forming a significant species barrier between it and its genetically closest sister taxon, Claire's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. mamiratra), farther to the north.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{living near}} the Goodman's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M.lehilahytsara), Simmons' <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M.simmonsi), and the brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M.rufus), Rasoloarison et al. {{reported}} no indications of gene flow between these four sympatric species. [...] The population at Marohita Forest {{is considered a}} distinct species using the metapopulation lineage concept of species. It is nearly identical in appearance to the other eastern <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs,</b> which are known for being cryptic species.|$|R
2500|$|The Marohita <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (Microcebus marohita) is {{a species}} of <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> known only from the Marohita Forest in eastern Madagascar, {{near the village of}} Marolambo. [...] Specimens were first {{collected}} in December 2003, and its discovery was announced in 2013 along with the Anosy <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (Microcebus tanosi). [...] It is a large <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> weighing up to , and lives within the same area as the Goodman's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M.lehilahytsara), Simmons' <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M.simmonsi), and the brown <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M.rufus), all four of which are nearly identical in appearance. [...] Its fur is [...] on its back and grayish-beige on its underside. [...] Nothing is known about its behavior. [...] Its conservation status was evaluated as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2012, before it was formally described, because its only known habitat had severely degraded between 2003 and 2012.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} end of the Arnhold's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur's</b> range is bordered by the range of the northern rufous <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. tavaratra), forming a significant species barrier between it and its genetically closest sister taxa, the Sambirano <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (M. sambiranensis), further to the southwest.|$|R
50|$|Madame Berthe’s <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> is an {{omnivore}} and mainly {{feeds on}} fruits and flowers of different tree and shrub species, insect secretions, gum, arthropods and small vertebrates like geckos and chameleons. Compared {{to the dry}} and the wet season of Madame Berthe’s <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur’s</b> niche, it spends more time feeding in the dry season while the wet season is for mating. Compared to the sympatric gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> Madame Berthe’s <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> eats fruit only occasionally and eats mainly insects. Similar to the sympatric gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> Madame Berthe’s <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> is able {{to adapt to the}} fluctuation of resources. There is a high overlap in the feeding niche of both lemurs suggesting that they avoid competition by mutually excluding each other on a small scale.|$|R
50|$|Goodman's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (Microcebus lehilahytsara) is {{a species}} of <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> from the region near Andasibe in eastern Madagascar.|$|R
50|$|The <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> are nocturnal lemurs of {{the genus}} Microcebus. Like all <b>lemurs,</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> are native to Madagascar.|$|R
500|$|Researchers have {{identified}} {{differences in the}} tooth morphology {{of the first and}} second molars between the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> and the reddish-gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur.</b> [...] In the reddish-gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur,</b> the first lower molar (m1) is squared and both the first and second upper molars (M1 and M2) have slight indentations around the middle of the posterior margin. The gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> has a more elongated m1 and lacks the aforementioned indentation on M1 and M2. [...] In terms of its general dentition, the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> shares the same dental formula as all other members of its family, Cheirogaleidae: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> {{species are}} {{considered}} to be a cryptic species complex. The species-rich <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> (Microcebus genus) are distributed over nearly all remaining forest areas of Madagascar with a high variability in species distribution patterns and are very similar morphologically. They are so similar, that the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> was considered the only <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> until recent studies proved it to be otherwise. Along with other morphological similarities, the Madame Berthe’s <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> and the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> share a similar diet (both containing the same food groups but in different proportions) and live in the same region of western Madagascar. Both of these Microcebus species have an omnivorous diet, and used the same food sources, including sugary homopteran secretions, fruit, flowers, gum, arthropods and small vertebrates (e.g. geckos, chameleons). Because of their recent common ancestry, closely related species ought to exhibit high similarities in their use of biotic and abiotic resources, susceptibility to predators and responses to disturbances and stress. However, despite the overlapping niches, {{studies have shown that the}} territories of the two <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> species have very little to no overlap. The Madame Berthe's <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> population is sparse and spread out over a more widespread area; while the gray <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> had a much denser population in a smaller area.|$|R
50|$|Pygmy <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> (Microcebus myoxinus), {{also known}} as Peters' <b>mouse</b> <b>lemur</b> or {{dormouse}} lemur, is a primate weighing only 43 - 55 g; {{it is the second}} smallest of the <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs.</b> Its dorsal side is a rufous-brown colour, and creamy-white ventrally. It lives in dry deciduous forests.|$|R
500|$|Though giant <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs</b> are {{relatively}} small cheirogaleids, they are {{more than three times}} larger than the smallest members of the family, the <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs.</b> Their body weight averages [...] At around , their bushy and long tail is longer than their head-body length, which averages [...] Their forelimbs are shorter than the hind limbs (with an intermembral index of 70), a trait shared with <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs.</b> The skull {{is similar to that of}} dwarf and <b>mouse</b> <b>lemurs,</b> and the auditory bullae are small.|$|R
