Two forms (MkI and MklI) have been calibrated using solid and liquid aerosols, measured by microscopy, fluorimetry, and aerodynamic particle sizer.

The resultant calibrations differ in some respects from the manufacturer's, but are broadly consistent with theory. Suggestions are made for improvements to the design. The results of these investigations were used to produce size-dependent curves for deposition on each plate, and between stages. An <b>entry</b> <b>efficiency</b> curve was assumed. A computer simulation was then performed of the sampling of various log-normal size distributions, so that measured distribution parameters can be corrected for the inevitable imperfections of the impactors.

Thus, such analogues should not be used as model compounds for determining the effect of a monomer on decomposition rate.

For adherent mammalian cells, we show that entry is favoured by low pH and by increasing the available cell-surface area through a transient release from the substratum. Low pH also stimulated baculovirus entry into mammalian cells grown in suspension which, optimally, could reach 90 % of the transduced population. The basic loop, residues 268 &#x 2013; 281, of the viral surface glycoprotein gp 64 was required for entry and a tetra mutant with increasing basicity increased entry into a range of mammalian cells.

The metabolic efficiency of single AP has important consequences for the computational power of the cell, which is determined by its biophysical properties and morphologies. Here we adopt biophysically-based two-compartment models to investigate how dendrites affect energy efficiency of APs in cortical pyramidal neurons. We measure the Na+ entry during the spike and examine how it is efficiently used for generating AP depolarization. We show that increasing the proportion of dendritic area or coupling conductance between two chambers decreases Na+ <b>entry</b> <b>efficiency</b> of somatic AP. Activating inward Ca 2 + current in dendrites results in dendritic spike, which increases AP efficiency. Activating Ca 2 +-activated outward K+ current in dendrites, however, decreases Na+ <b>entry</b> <b>efficiency.</b> We demonstrate that the active and passive dendrites take effects by altering the overlap between Na+ influx and internal current flowing from soma to dendrite.

Among the Ipa proteins, IpaB and IpaC form a soluble complex in the bacterial supernatant {{which appears to be}} sufficient to initiate the cellular rearrangements necessary to achieve bacterial entry.

Bacteria in the early phase of exponential growth are six times more invasive than those in the stationary phase. The <b>entry</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the bacteria present on the cell surface appears to correlate with the percentage of those that are able to secrete their invasins.

40|$|Nipah virus (NiV) is {{a deadly}} {{emerging}} paramyxovirus. The NiV attachment (NiV-G) and fusion (NiV-F) envelope glycoproteins mediate both syncytium formation and viral entry. Specific N-glycans on paramyxovirus fusion proteins are generally required for proper conformational integrity and biological function. However, removal of individual N-glycans on NiV-F had little {{negative effect on}} processing or fusogenicity and has even resulted in slightly increased fusogenicity. Here, we report that in both syncytium formation and viral entry assays, removal of multiple N-glycans on NiV-F resulted in marked increases in fusogenicity (> 5 -fold) but also resulted in increased sensitivity to neutralization by NiV-F-specific antisera. The mechanism underlying the hyperfusogenicity of these NiV-F N-glycan mutants is likely due to more-robust six-helix bundle formation, as these mutants showed increased fusion kinetics and were more resistant to neutralization by a fusioninhibitory reagent based on the C-terminal heptad repeat region of NiV-F. Finally, we demonstrate that the fusogenicities of the NiV-F N-glycan mutants were inversely correlated with the relative avidities of NiV-F’s interactions with NiV-G, providing support for the attachment protein “displacement ” model of paramyxovirus fusion. Our results indicate that N-glycans on NiV-F protect NiV from antibody neutralization, suggest that this “shielding ” role comes together with limiting cell-cell fusion and viral <b>entry</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> and point to th...|$|R

We constructed these viruses with an additional gene expressing an autofluorescent reporter protein to allow direct detection of every infected cell. A virus with a wild-type H protein entered cells through SLAM {{two to three times}} more efficiently than a virus with the H protein of the attenuated strain Edmonston, whereas cell <b>entry</b> <b>efficiency</b> through CD 46 was lower. However, these subtle differences were amplified at the cell fusion stage because the wild-type H protein failed to fuse CD 46 -expressing cells. We also proved formally that a mutation in H protein residue 481 (asparagine to tyrosine) results in improved CD 46 -specific entry. To define the selective pressure exerted on that codon, we monitored its evolution in different H protein backgrounds and found that several passages in CD 46 -expressing Vero cells were necessary to shift it in the majority of the MV RNA. To verify the importance of these observations for human infections, we examined MV entry into peripheral blood mononuclear cells and observed that viruses with asparagine 481 H proteins infect these cells more efficiently...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Binding of the viral {{envelope}} protein (Env), and particularly of its gp 120 subunit, to the cellular CD 4 receptor is the first essential step of the HIV- 1 entry process. The CD 4 binding site (CD 4 bs) of gp 120, and especially a recessed cavity occupied by the CD 4 Phe 43 residue, {{are known to be}} highly conserved among the different circulating subtypes and therefore constitute particularly interesting targets for vaccine and drug design. The miniCD 4 proteins are a promising class of CD 4 bs inhibitors. Studying virus evolution under pressure of CD 4 bs inhibitors could provide insight on the gp 120 -CD 4 interaction and viral entry. Results The present study reports on the resistance induction of two subtype B HIV- 1 against the most active miniCD 4, M 48 U 1, and its ancestor, M 48, and how these mutated positions affect CD 4 bs recognition, <b>entry</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and sensitivity to other CD 4 bs inhibitors. Resistance against M 48 U 1 was always associated with S 375 R/N substitution in both BaL and SF 162; M 48 resistance was associated with D 474 N substitution in SF 162 and with H 105 Y substitution in BaL. In addition, some other mutations at position V 255 and G 471 were of importance for SF 162 resistant viruses. Except for 474, all of these mutated positions are conserved, and introducing them into an SF 162 Env expressing infectious molecular clone (pBRNL 4. 3 SF 162) resulted in decreased <b>entry</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Furthermore, resistant mutants showed at least some cross-resistance towards other CD 4 bs inhibitors, the V 3 monoclonal antibody 447 - 52 D and some even against the monoclonal antibody 17 b, of which the epitope overlaps the co-receptor binding site. Conclusions The mutations H 105 Y, V 255 M, S 375 R/N, G 471 R/E, and D 474 N are found to be involved in resistance towards M 48 and M 48 U 1.

A previous study demonstrated that the newly transmitted viruses (in infants) of chronically infected mother–infant pairs (MIPs) were fitter in terms of growth, which was imparted by their envelope (Env) glycoprotein V 1 –V 5 regions, than those in the corresponding chronically infected mothers. In order to investigate whether the higher fitness of transmitted viruses was conferred by their higher <b>entry</b> <b>efficiency</b> directed by the V 1 –V 5 regions during perinatal transmission, the fusogenicity of Env containing V 1 –V 5 regions derived from transmitted and nontranmsmitted viruses of five chronically infected MIPs and two acutely infected MIPs was analysed using two different cell–cell fusion assays.

Since Chinese rhesus (rh) macaques do not usually develop SARS after SARS-CoV infection, it has been suggested that rh-ACE 2 probably does not support viral entry efficiently. To determine the role of rh-ACE 2 in early lung pathogenesis in vivo, we studied eleven Chinese rhesus monkeys experimentally infected with a pathogenic SARS-CoVPUMC 01 strain. Rh-ACE 2 genes were amplified from all animals by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and their function was studied in vitro using a pseudovirus entry assay. Many natural non-synonymous (NS) changes were found in rh-ACE 2 genes. Compared to human (hu) ACE 2, thirty-eight consensus NS changes were found in rh-ACE 2. Since these changes do not interact with the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV, rh-ACE 2 in general is as effective as human homolog in supporting viral entry. Rh-ACE 2, however, is more polymorphic than hu-ACE 2. Additional sporadic NS substitutions in clone Rh 11 - 7 reduced the level of rh-ACE 2 protein expression and did not support viral entry effectively. Further mutagenesis analysis showed that a natural mutation Y 217 N dramatically alters ACE 2 expression and <b>entry</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Moreover, introduction of the Y 217 N mutation into hu-ACE 2 caused the down-regulation of expression and reduced viral <b>entry</b> <b>efficiency.</b> These results indicate that the Y 217 N mutation plays a role in modulating SARS-CoV infection.

Up to date values for H-H 2 collisional rate coefficients are adopted, and some derivations of H 2 -H 2 rovibrational rate coefficients from existing literature data are proposed. Several models {{as a function}} of temperature, density, and ionization rate are presented. We found that H 2 infrared emission in X-ray dominated regions (XDR) is potentially observable for temperatures and ionization rates lower than certain critical values (typically T < 1000 K and zeta/n(sub H) < 10 (exp - 15) cc/s where zeta is the ionization rate).

We find that the potential welfare gains from RTP are only partially explained by price volatility and are rather driven by opposing wholesale price effects caused by the technology portfolio changes from carbon taxation. Consequently, annual benefits from RTP actually change nonmonotonously with the carbon tax level, implying that increasing RTP at relatively high VRE shares can be both less and much more beneficial than without VRE supply.

We have mapped the ability of one SI HIV- 1 isolate to eliminate CD 4 + human cells in SCID-hu mice to a region of the env gene including the three most amino-terminal variable regions (V 1 to V 3). We find that for all of the HIV- 1 isolates that we studied, a nonlinear relationship exists between viral replication and the depletion of CD 4 + cells. This relationship can best be described mathematically with a Hill-type plot indicating that a threshold level of viral replication, at which cytopathic effects begin to be seen, exists for HIV- 1 infection of thymus/liver grafts in SCID-hu mice. This threshold level is 1 copy of viral DNA for every 11 cells (95 % confidence interval = 1 copy of HIV- 1 per 67 cells to 1 copy per 4 cells).

Chimeric SHIVSF 162 virus expressing P 3 gp 120 of the pathogenic variant, designated SHIVSF 162 PC, was also constructed and assessed for its pathogenicity and mucosal transmissibility in vivo. We found that, compared to wild-type SHIVSF 162 gp 120, P 3 gp 120 conferred in vitro neutralization resistance and increased <b>entry</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the virus but was compromised in its fusion-inducing capacity. In vivo, SHIVSF 162 PC infected two of two and two of three rhesus macaques by the intravenous and intravaginal routes, respectively. Nevertheless, although peak viremia reached 106 to 107 RNA copies per ml of plasma in some infected animals and was associated with depletion of gut-associated CD 4 + lymphocytes, none of the animals maintained a viral set point that would be predictive of progression to disease. Together, the data from this study suggest a lack of correlation between <b>entry</b> <b>efficiency</b> and cytopathic properties of envelope glycoproteins with viral pathogenicity. Furthermore, whereas env gp 120 contains the determinant for enhanced mucosal transmissibility of SHIVSF 162 P 3, the determinant(s) of its increased virulence may require additional sequence changes in env gp 41 and/or maps to other viral genes...|$|E
40|$|The {{affinity}} {{of human}} immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope for CD 4 and CCR 5 appears {{to be associated with}} aspects of R 5 virus (virus using the CCR 5 coreceptor) pathogenicity. However, <b>entry</b> <b>efficiency</b> results from complex interactions between the viral envelope glycoprotein and both CD 4 and CCR 5, which limits attempts to correlate viral pathogenicity with surrogate measures of envelope CD 4 and CCR 5 affinities. Here, we present a system that provides a quantitative and comprehensive characterization of viral <b>entry</b> <b>efficiency</b> as a direct interdependent function of both CD 4 and CCR 5 levels. This receptor affinity profiling system also revealed heretofore unappreciated complexities underlying CD 4 /CCR 5 usage. We first developed a dually inducible cell line in which CD 4 and CCR 5 could be simultaneously and independently regulated within a physiologic range of surface expression. Infection by multiple HIV type 1 (HIV- 1) and simian immunodeficiency virus isolates could be examined simultaneously for up to 48 different combinations of CD 4 /CCR 5 expression levels, resulting in a distinct usage pattern for each virus. Thus, each virus generated a unique three-dimensional surface plot in which viral infectivity varied as a function of both CD 4 and CCR 5 expression. From this functional form, we obtained a sensitivity vector along with corresponding metrics that quantified an isolate's overall efficiency of CD 4 /CCR 5 usage. When applied to viral isolates with well-characterized sensitivities to entry/fusion inhibitors, the vector metrics were able to encapsulate their known biological phenotypes. The application of the vector metrics also indicated that envelopes derived from elite suppressors had overall-reduced entry efficiencies compared to those of envelopes derived from chronically infected viremic progressors. Our affinity-profiling system may help to refine studies of R 5 virus tropism and pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} extent of {{regulation}} in a democracy with political corruption. Elected politicians can restrict entry of firms in exchange for bribes from entrepreneurs. Full liberalisation implies free <b>entry</b> and allocative <b>efficiency</b> and {{is supported by a}} majority of voters. Voters reelect politicians based on observed performance. We study Markov-perfect equilibria of the resulting game, and demonstrate that voters agree to tolerate some corruption and inefficient regulation in political equilibrium. Efficient policies can be promoted by productivity growth. Political corruption entails excessive stabilization of aggregate fluctuations. Corruption, performance voting, economic growth. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study how}} resale affects auctions with costly entry {{in a model}} where bidders possess twodimensional private {{information}} signals: entry costs and valuations. We establish the existence of symmetric entry equilibrium and identify sufficient conditions under which the equilibrium is unique. Our analysis suggests that the opportunity of resale affects both entry and bidding, and, in particular, it induces motivation for both speculative entry and resale hunting abstentions. Our numerical results suggest that while the <b>entry</b> probability and <b>efficiency</b> are always higher when resale is allowed, {{the effect on the}} seller’s expected revenue is ambiguous. ...|$|R
40|$|Using a newly {{developed}} database for 8 transition economies, this paper examines whether reforms and political freedom {{are important for}} foreign bank entry. The paper provides strong evidence that foreign bank entry positively responds to reform measures. We also find some evidence {{for the importance of}} political freedom. The size of the financial sector and the openness of a country appear to be important determinants of a country's willingness to attract foreign banks. Moreover, we find that reforms significantly affect foreign bank <b>entry</b> via the <b>efficiency</b> of the financial sector, the structure of the financial sector and by stimulating domestic investment. ...|$|R
