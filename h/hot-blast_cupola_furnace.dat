40|$|In {{process of}} pig iron and cast iron {{production}} secondary {{raw materials and}} industrial wastes are formed The most abundant secondaryproduct originating in these processes are furnace slag. Blast <b>furnace</b> slag and <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> slag originates from melting of gangue parts of metal bearing materials, slag forming additions and coke ash. In general, slag are compounds of oxides of metallic and non-metallic elements, which form chemical compounds and solutions {{with each other and}} also contain small volume of metals, sulfides of metals and gases. Chemical, mineralogical and physical properties of slag determinate their utilisation in different fields of industry. The paper presents results from the research of the blast <b>furnace</b> and <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> slag utilization in the concrete production. Pilotexperiments of the concrete production were performed, by that the blast <b>furnace</b> and <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> slag with a fractions of 0 – 4 mm; 4 – 8 mm; 8 – 16 mm were used as a natural substitute. A <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> slag and combination of the blast <b>furnace</b> and <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> slagwere used in the experiments.

5|$|A {{blast furnace}} {{converts}} raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> to produce cast iron. The earliest specimens of cast iron found in China date to the 5th century BC during the late Spring and Autumn period, yet the oldest discovered blast furnaces date to the 3rd century BCE and the majority date to the period after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) established a government monopoly over the iron industry in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely foundries which recast iron that had been smelt elsewhere). Iron ore smelted in blast furnaces during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the pig iron scraps were remelted in the <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> to make cast iron. <b>Cupola</b> <b>furnaces</b> utilized a cold blast traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of charcoal and pig iron was introduced.

40|$|The foundry {{industry}} {{is the major}} contributor in pollution among all other industries in India. At present only few foundries in India have pollution controllable system. Most of these casting industries use <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> that emits gases namely carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, suspended particle matter, dust and ash. Though, emission from single furnace is not considerable but it has huge impact if much such type of furnaces located in particular area. A inclusive study {{on the type of}} gas emitted, rate of gases and amount of pollution cause from <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> is essential before design any emission controlling system. In this paper investigation on furnace wastages is carried out on GIDC (Gujarat, India). The outcomes of research are based on data taken out from <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> where the pollution measuring system was set up. The rates of emission of gases are measured hourly for a whole day and it has been noted that in very first hours of firing the emission was at peak.

40|$|The <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> generates {{more than}} 50 % {{of the liquid}} iron used to produce the 9 + million tons of {{castings}} annually. The cupola converts iron and steel into cast iron. The main advantages of the <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> are lower energy costs than those of competing furnaces (electric) {{and the ability to}} melt less expensive metallic scrap than the competing furnaces. However the chemical and physical processes that take place in the <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> are highly complex making it difficult to operate the furnace in optimal fashion. The results are low energy efficiency and poor recovery of important and expensive alloy elements due to oxidation. Between 1990 and 2004 {{under the auspices of the}} Department of Energy, the American Foundry Society and General Motors Corp. a computer simulation of the <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> was developed that accurately describes the complex behavior of the furnace. When provided with the furnace input conditions the model provides accurate values of the output conditions in a matter of seconds. It also provides key diagnostics. Using clues from the diagnostics a trained specialist can infer changes in the operation that will move the system toward higher efficiency. Repeating the process in an iterative fashion leads to near optimum operating conditions with just a few iterations. More advanced uses of the program have been examined. The program is currently being combined with an ''Expert System'' to permit optimization in real time. The program has been combined with ''neural network'' programs to affect very easy scanning of a wide range of furnace operation. Rudimentary efforts were successfully made to operate the furnace using a computer. References to these more advanced systems will be found in the ''Cupola Handbook''.

50|$|<b>Cupola</b> <b>furnaces</b> {{were built}} in China {{as early as the}} Warring States period (403-221 BC), {{although}} Donald Wagner writes that some iron ore melted in the blast furnace may have been cast directly into molds. During the Han Dynasty (202 BC - 220 AD), most, if not all, iron smelted in the blast furnace was remelted in a cupola furnace; it was designed so that a cold blast injected at the bottom traveled through tuyere pipes across the top where the charge (i.e. of charcoal and scrap or pig iron) was dumped, the air becoming a hot blast before reaching the bottom of the furnace where the iron was melted and then drained into appropriate molds for casting.

40|$|Abstract—A {{survey of}} the working {{conditions}} at a Danish slag wool production factory during the early technological phase in the 1940 s is presented. No exposure data, however, are available for that period. So, a full-scale simulation of the past production of slag wool has been performed. Air monitoring {{was carried out in}} the working area around the <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace.</b> The aim was to measure exposure to air pollutants other than fibres. Such exposure might have confounded a possible association between lung cancer and exposure to fibres, in the early technological phase of slag wool production. The simulation experiment demonstrated exposure to PAH, a known lung carcinogen. The effect of other concurrent exposures is difficult to assess. Time-weighted average concentrations of particulate material ranged between 12. 9 and 49. 1 mg m ~ 3 at the upper decks around the cupola. Corresponding concentrations of the dominant metals zinc and lead were 4. 4 - 22. 7 mgZnm " 3 and 0. 9 - 4. 7 mg Pb m " 3.
