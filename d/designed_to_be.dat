5|$|The {{standard}} connectors were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{more robust}} than many past connectors. This is because USB is hot-pluggable, and the connectors {{would be used}} more frequently, and perhaps with less care, than previous connectors.|$|E

5|$|A {{complementary}} telescope, {{looking at}} even longer wavelengths than Hubble or JWST, was the European Space Agency's Herschel Space Observatory, launched on May 14, 2009. Like JWST, Herschel was not <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> serviced after launch, {{and had a}} mirror substantially larger than Hubble's, but observed only in the far infrared and submillimeter. It needed helium coolant, of which it ran out on April 29, 2013.|$|E

5|$|After an implant is placed, the {{internal}} components {{are covered with}} either a healing abutment, or a cover screw. A healing abutment passes through the mucosa, and the surrounding mucosa is adapted around it. A cover screw is {{flush with the surface}} of the dental implant, and is <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> completely covered by mucosa. After an integration period, a second surgery is required to reflect the mucosa and place a healing abutment.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{versions}} of the Mellotron were manufactured by competitors {{in the early to}} mid-1970s. The Mattel Optigan was a toy keyboard <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used in the home, which played back sounds using optical discs. This was followed by the Vako Orchestron in 1975, which used a more professional-sounding version of the same technology. It was popularised by Patrick Moraz.|$|E
5|$|Although the A303 as a {{whole is}} <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of a route from London to Exeter, a popular {{alternative}} is to take the M4 motorway to Bristol, followed by the M5.

5|$|An intubating stylet is a {{malleable}} metal wire <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{inserted into the}} endotracheal tube to make the tube conform better to the upper airway anatomy of the specific individual. This aid is commonly used with a difficult laryngoscopy. Just as with laryngoscope blades, there are also several types of available stylets, such as the Verathon Stylet, which is specifically designed to follow the 60° blade angle of the GlideScope video laryngoscope.|$|E
5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> capable of carrying wet or dry bulk cargoes. This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO {{would be able to}} switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on one leg of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{states that}} {{chromosomal}} toxin-antitoxin systems are <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. RelE, for example, {{is a global}} inhibitor of translation during nutrient stress, and its expression reduces the chance of starvation by lowering the cell's nutrient requirements. A homologue of mazF toxin called mazF-mx is essential for fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus.|$|E
