5|$|A bushfire burnt {{through the}} area in December 1993, {{destroying}} the former railway's bridge over Clackline Brook. Clackline Bridge survived, weakened but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> condition. The damage included internal expansion joints that had failed, split bedlogs, and other deteriorated timbers. Steel props were installed to support the bridge, and the substructure was repaired in 1995, which mainly involved replacing connecting bolts. A concrete approach slab was installed adjacent to the western abutment in 1998, and in 2013 the concrete deck near pier13 was repaired. Clackline Bridge was the crossing point for Great Eastern Highway until the highway's bypass of Clackline opened in February 2008. The bridge remains open to traffic, {{as part of the}} local road network. In July 2012 it once more carried highway traffic, excluding heavy vehicles, when an accident temporarily closed Great Eastern Highway at Spencers Brook Road.|$|E
5|$|A {{fiberglass}} Space Race cabinet {{was designed}} for the game by Atari's product designer, George Faraco. The tall, angular cabinet, reminiscent of the fiberglass cabinet for Computer Space, {{was the first to}} display the Atari logo. The cabinet design was distinctive enough that Bushnell considered using it for Pong as well, but the production costs proved too high and only 50 units were made before the design was dropped and Space Race switched to a more traditional rectangular cabinet. The final cabinet stands nearly 5 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds. Bushnell later stated that the molds to make the fiberglass cabinets cost US$2000 and could only make one per day due to the complicated shape, and Atari felt the cost did not justify buying enough molds to make a full production run <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> amount of time. The final Space Race cabinet was reused later that same year for Pong Doubles, a four-player version of Pong.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the damage}} caused by the cannon, the castle escaped the slighting, or {{deliberate}} damaging, that occurred to many other castles {{at the end of the}} civil war. Nonetheless, Richard Prater was forbidden to return to the castle, despite his promises to support Parliament, and his son, George Prater, only recovered Nunney from its interim owners after Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660. The castle declined and was sold by the Praters to William Whitchurch around 1700. During the 18th century the building was still <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> condition and in 1789 an order was received make it ready to receive French prisoners, although it is unlikely they ever arrived.|$|E
25|$|Whether the {{hierarchical}} Bayes method confers a substantial advantage in practice remains controversial, however.

25|$|Upon the {{creation}} of the government of the Town of Brunswick in April 1807, three commissioners of schools were appointed. Their tasks were to develop schools within the town and offer funding using the Common School Fund, which the New York Legislature had set up in 1805 to help cover the costs of public education. In 1812, the Legislature developed a school district system in which each district was self-governing.

25|$|Given {{the rules}} of any two-person game with {{a finite number of}} positions, one can always trivially {{construct}} a minimax algorithm that would exhaustively traverse the game tree. However, since for many non-trivial games such an algorithm would require an infeasible amount of time to generate a move in a given position, a game is not considered to be solved weakly or strongly unless the algorithm can be run by existing hardware <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> time. Many algorithms rely on a huge pre-generated database, and are effectively nothing more.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the initial}} {{analysis}} is correct, {{there is another}} effect that can happen, known as the overvoltage effect. Additional voltage is sometimes required, beyond the voltage predicted by the E°cell. This {{may be due to}} kinetic rather than thermodynamic considerations. In fact, it has been proven that the activation energy for the chloride ion is very low, hence favorable in kinetic terms. In other words, although the voltage applied is thermodynamically sufficient to drive electrolysis, the rate is so slow that to make the process proceed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> time frame, the voltage of the external source has to be increased (hence, overvoltage).|$|E

25|$|TEMED (N, N, N, N-tetramethylethylenediamine) (C6H16N2; mW: 116.21) stabilizes free {{radicals}} and improves polymerization. The rate of polymerisation and {{the properties of}} the resulting gel depend on the concentrations of {{free radicals}}. Increasing the amount of free radicals results in a decrease in the average polymer chain length, an increase in gel turbidity and a decrease in gel elasticity. Decreasing the amount shows the reverse effect. The lowest catalytic concentrations that allow polymerisation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> period of time should be used. APS and TEMED are typically used at approximately equimolar concentrations in the range of 1 to 10 mM.|$|E
25|$|Reasoning {{efficiency}}. This {{refers to}} the run time efficiency of the system. The ability {{of the knowledge base}} to be updated and the reasoner to develop new inferences <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> period of time. In some ways this is the flip side of expressive adequacy. In general the more powerful a representation, the more it has expressive adequacy, the less efficient its automated reasoning engine will be. Efficiency was often an issue, especially for early applications of knowledge representation technology. They were usually implemented in interpreted environments such as Lisp which were slow compared to more traditional platforms of the time.|$|E
25|$|Centipedes {{are mostly}} nocturnal. Studies on their {{activity}} rhythms confirm this, {{although a few}} observations of centipedes active during the day have been made, and one species, Strigamia chinophila, is diurnal. What centipedes actually eat is not well known because of their cryptic lifestyles and thorough mastication of food. Laboratory feeding trials support that they will feed as generalists, taking almost anything that is soft-bodied and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> size range. Earthworms may provide the bulk of diets for geophilomorphs, since they burrow through the soil and earthworm bodies would be easily pierced by their venom claws. Geophilomorphs probably cannot subdue earthworms larger than themselves, so smaller earthworms may be a substantial proportion of their diet.|$|E

25|$|Geometric group theory attacks these {{problems}} from a geometric viewpoint, either by viewing groups as geometric objects, or by finding suitable geometric objects a group acts on. The first idea is made precise {{by means of}} the Cayley graph, whose vertices correspond to group elements and edges correspond to right multiplication in the group. Given two elements, one constructs the word metric given by the length of the minimal path between the elements. A theorem of Milnor and Svarc then says that given a group G acting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> manner on a metric space X, for example a compact manifold, then G is quasi-isometric (i.e. looks similar from a distance) to the space X.|$|E
25|$|Juries {{are used}} in trials for all trials {{involving}} Category 4 offences such as treason, murder and manslaughter, although in exceptional circumstances a judge-alone trial may be ordered. At the option of the defendant, juries {{may be used in}} trials involving Category 3 offences, that is offences where the maximum penalty available is two years imprisonment or greater. In civil cases juries are usually only used in cases of defamation. Juries must initially try to reach a unanimous verdict, but if one cannot be reached <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> timeframe, the judge may accept a majority verdict of all-but-one (i.e. 11–1 or 10–1) in criminal cases and three-quarters (i.e. 9–3 or 9–2) in civil cases.|$|E
25|$|Scientifically, this {{is readily}} explained. Barbiturate overdoses {{typically}} cause death by {{depression of the}} respiratory center, but the effect is variable. Some patients may have complete cessation of respiratory drive, whereas others may only have depression of respiratory function. In addition, cardiac activity can last {{for a long time}} after cessation of respiration. Since death is pronounced after asystole and given that the expectation is for a rapid death in lethal injection, multiple drugs are required, specifically potassium chloride to stop the heart. In fact, in the case of Clarence Ray Allen, a second dose of potassium chloride was required to attain asystole. The position of most death-penalty supporters is that death should be attained <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> amount of time.|$|E
