In 118790 Adam de Dutton founded a priory on the site for Norbertine canons but this was short-lived and there is now {{no trace of the}} priory. It is likely that the building of the present church began {{in the middle of the}} 13th century. Towards the end of the 16th century, the chancel area was remodelled and a pulpit, altar rails and communion table were installed. In 1645 the church was extensively altered and extended. The south and west walls of the nave were rebuilt and the roof of the nave was lowered. A small chapel and vestry with a stone foundation and timber <b>framed</b> <b>wall</b> were added to the south side of the chancel, while a stone extension was added to the north side. In 1711 the east end of the chancel was rebuilt and a brick tower was added at the east end of the church. In 1722 a gallery was built. Wooden floors were installed in 1813, the vestry was incorporated into the church and a new vestry was built onto the south side of the tower. In 1857 the chancel floor was tiled, the walls were painted with medieval designs and the timber supports and the chancel ceiling were plastered. Stained glass was added to windows and the gallery was removed. By 1880 the church needed major repairs, and because of this the new church was built and the old church ceased to be the parish church. Repairs were undertaken in 1894 for dry rot, in 1927 for death watch beetle and in 1958, again for death watch beetle. In 1971 the church passed into the care of the Redundant Churches Fund, the predecessor of the Churches Conservation Trust.|$|E

40|$|Recently an {{innovative}} composite panel system was developed, where a thin insulation layer was used externally between two plasterboards {{to improve the}} fire performance of light gauge cold-formed steel <b>frame</b> <b>walls.</b> In this research, finite-element thermal models of both the traditional light gauge cold-formed steel <b>frame</b> <b>wall</b> panels with cavity insulation and the new light gauge cold-formed steel <b>frame</b> composite <b>wall</b> panels were developed to simulate their thermal behaviour under standard and realistic fire conditions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Studies {{have shown}} that {{convective}} air flow can significantly reduce the thermal resistance of <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> insulated with mineral fibre insulation (MFI).

40|$|Light {{gauge steel}} <b>frame</b> <b>wall</b> systems are {{commonly}} used in industrial and commercial buildings, {{and there is a}} need for simple fire design rules to predict their load capacities and fire resistance ratings. During fire events, the light gauge steel <b>frame</b> <b>wall</b> studs are subjected to non-uniform temperature distributions that cause thermal bowing, neutral axis shift and magnification effects and thus resulting in a combined axial compression and bending action on the studs. In this research, a series of full-scale fire tests was conducted first to evaluate the performance of light gauge steel <b>frame</b> <b>wall</b> systems with eight different wall configurations under standard fire conditions. Finite element models of light gauge steel <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> were then developed, analysed under transient and steady-state conditions and validated using full-scale fire tests. Using the results from fire tests and finite element analyses, a detailed investigation was undertaken into the prediction of axial compression strength and failure times of light gauge steel <b>frame</b> <b>wall</b> studs in standard fires using the available fire design rules based on Australian, American and European standards. The results from both fire tests and finite element analyses were used to investigate the ability of these fire design rules to include the complex effects of non-uniform temperature distributions and their accuracy in predicting the axial compression strength of wall studs and the failure times. Suitable modifications were then proposed to the fire design rules.

40|$|Wood <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> {{typically}} need a {{vapour barrier}} at the warm side to avoid interstitial condensation due to vapour diffusion and air leakages from the interior. A more vapour open material {{than the traditional}} vapour barriers, here called vapour retarder, could allow condensed moisture, built-in-moisture or moisture from minor leakages to dry to the interior {{in addition to the}} outward drying. The application of permeable vapour retarders in wood <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> have been investigated in this study by the use of a hygrothermal simulation tool. A traditional wood <b>frame</b> <b>wall</b> usually has good drying possibilities to the exterior. If a vapour retarder should {{have an effect on the}} total drying, it must not be too vapour tight. The purpose of this study was to find some threshold value for the maximum vapour resistance of a vapour retarder—when a requirement is that it should have a relatively large effect of the total drying of the wall. The increased risk for condensation as the vapour resistance decreases has however not been investigated in this study. In general it was found that permeable vapour barriers have relatively little effect on the total drying of ordinary wood <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> in a Nordic climate...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{historic}} buildings whose construction {{is based on}} timber <b>frame</b> <b>walls.</b> Most buildings built during the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries were based on timber <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> with vertical support elements. These timber frame elements are affected by their moisture content and by the passage of time. If the interaction of the timber <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> with hygrothermal fluctuations were known, the maintenance of these buildings could be improved significantly. To determine the moisture content of wood there are two types of meters on the market: on the one hand, capacitance meters which consist of two side ends and where the moisture content is measured locally between two peaks. On the other hand, there are meters based on the variation of electromagnetic transmittance of timber, which depends on the moisture of timber. The second ones are very expensive and difficult to handle. This work presents a new non-intrusive capacitive sensor that measures the global moisture content in a section of the timber <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> and therefore its accuracy is similar to the accuracy that can be obtained with electromagnetic transmittance meters. Additionally, as it is a capacitive sensor, it is low cost and easy to operate...|$|R
40|$|Traditional timber <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> are {{constructive}} elements {{representative of}} different timber frame buildings {{that are well}} {{known as one of}} the most efficient seismic resistant structures in the world. Timber <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> were also used in the reconstruction of buildings of the old town of Lisbon after the earthquake of 1755 aiming at improving their seismic global behaviour. As it is important to preserve these structures, a better knowledge about their behaviour under seismic actions is important and can give some indications about possible retrofitting techniques to be used to improve the seismic performance. Due to the great rehabilitation effort currently carried out in many countries, a better understanding of retrofitting techniques is also needed. Therefore, this paper aims at providing a study on possible retrofitting techniques adopting traditional solutions such as bolts and steel plates. Static cyclic tests have been performed on retrofitted traditional timber <b>frame</b> <b>walls</b> in order to study their seismic performance.

50|$|The {{purposes}} of the walls in buildings are to support roofs, floors and ceilings; to enclose a space {{as part of the}} building envelope along with a roof to give buildings form; and to provide shelter and security. In addition, the wall may house various types of utilities such as electrical wiring or plumbing. Wall construction falls into two basic categories: <b>framed</b> <b>walls</b> or mass-walls. In <b>framed</b> <b>walls</b> the load is transferred to the foundation through posts, columns or studs. <b>Framed</b> <b>walls</b> most often have three or more separate components: the structural elements (such as 2×4 studs in a house wall), insulation, and finish elements or surfaces (such as drywall or panelling). Mass-walls are of a solid material including masonry, concrete including slipform stonemasonry, log building, cordwood construction, adobe, rammed earth, cob, earthbag construction, bottles, tin cans, straw-bale construction, and ice.|$|R
