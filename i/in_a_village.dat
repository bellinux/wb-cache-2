5|$|Briarcliff Manor's fire company {{existed for}} more than a year before Briarcliff Manor's incorporation. Frederick C. Messinger (a fireman in Kingston for ten years) and {{thirteen}} local men founded the private fire company in 1901. Thirty-six men became the company's charter members on March 4, 1902, and dues were set at 25cents per month. On April 15 of that year, the company took the name Briarcliff Steamer Company No. 1. The company's first equipment was a 1901 hand-drawn chemical apparatus, with a tank containing a mixture of water and sodium bicarbonate. Sulfuric acid would be added to the tank, creating carbon dioxide, which would propel the solution through the hose and help extinguish the fire. That first apparatus was white, which Messinger thought more visible than the conventional red <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>village</b> without street lights, and the village's engines remain white.|$|E
