25|$|A {{study by}} Peter Kuppens (2008) showed that extraverts and introverts engage in {{different}} behaviors when feeling pleasant, {{which may explain}} underestimation of the frequency and intensity of happiness exhibited by introverts. Specifically, Kuppens (2008) found that arousal and pleasantness are positively correlated for extraverts, which means that pleasant feelings {{are more likely to}} be accompanied by high arousal for extraverts. On the other hand, arousal and pleasantness are negatively correlated for introverts, resulting in introverts exhibiting low arousal when feeling pleasant. In other words, if <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> well in an extravert's life, which is a source of pleasant feelings, extraverts see such situation as an opportunity to engage in active behavior and goal pursuit, which brings about an active, aroused pleasant state. When <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> well for introverts, they see it as an opportunity to let down their guard, resulting in them feeling relaxed and content.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{industries}} {{where it is}} critical to make a correct decision within a strict time limit, based on the decision-maker’s knowledge of the current situation: for example air traffic controllers or surgeons. In these situations it is common that the key decision maker is supported by other team members or by complex monitoring systems feeding them information, which can involve multiple sources and formats of information. Even in these time-critical situations, the importance of having situation awareness (SA) is not constant: i.e. it is more critical to the outcome to have better SA for non-standard situations, such as points of high information traffic, extraneous activity and unforeseeable events. These ‘points of fracture’ are likely to cause additional workload on the individuals and therefore affect their SA and the time to make the decision. At the critical point the perceived situational awareness utilized to make the decision is directly affected by the cognitive workload to gain, comprehend and process the SA that is coming in to the operator, both general background SA and the SA specifically related to the decision. (Smith, K. T. 2013) In other words, if <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> OK the level of SA you have is not as critical as it is when something unusual happens or something goes wrong.|$|E

500|$|... "Biko" [...] means [...] "Please" [...] (or more {{accurately}} [...] "I implore you") in Igbo—a language spoken in Nigeria, the homeland of Okereke's parents—and is used [...] "when you're beseeching {{someone to do}} something". Okereke denied that {{it is about the}} murdered South African anti-apartheid protester Steve Biko. The lyrics of [...] "One Month Off" [...] reference feelings of anger and are about being in love with someone younger and unfaithful, while [...] "Zephyrus" [...] concerns an apology following neglect. The lyrics in the chorus of [...] "Ion Square", the last track on the original download release, are based on E. E. Cummings' poem [...] "I Carry Your Heart with Me". Okereke considers the song a personal favourite because it evokes the initial exciting stages of a new relationship when <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> right.|$|E
500|$|Markus and McFeely {{wanted to}} adapt Ed Brubaker's Winter Soldier storyline from the comics, which they {{described}} as [...] "the tone of Cap’s modern franchise", {{but it took}} the duo six months to convince themselves {{that they could do}} it. In the meantime, while thinking how to progress from the war film tone of The First Avenger, the writers settled on the conspiracy genre for the screenplay, and cited Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, and Marathon Man as influences, feeling it better conveyed Captain America's trust issues and contrasting values in the new world he was living in, with Markus saying, [...] "If you put that 1940s man into present day geo-politics <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to seem like a conspiracy. It's just going to seem dirty and underhanded and shifty, and people won't be telling the truth." [...] Three Days of the Condor in particular was used as the main source of the script structure, following the idea that the protagonist is being chased by a threat they, along with the audience, only discover halfway through the film.|$|E

Production was entirely credited to Jimmy Page, while it also served as Led Zeppelin's first album to utilise the skills and recording techniques of engineer Eddie Kramer. [...] Led Zeppelin archivist Dave Lewis wrote of the album's production, stating [...] "That the album {{turned out to be}} such a triumph, in particular for a production quality that still sounds fresh today, was in no small way due to the successful alliance with Page and Kramer in the control room." [...] This partnership was particularly exhibited in the central section of the track [...] "Whole Lotta Love". Kramer later said, [...] "The famous Whole Lotta Love mix, where <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> bananas, is a combination of Jimmy and myself just flying around on a small console twiddling every knob known to man." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn and was produced by Danyi Deats-Barrett. It was shot for two days in April 2005 in Toronto at a Church and a sound stage while Clarkson was on tour. According to Kahn, Clarkson was sick during the production and could not speak. During Clarkson's wardrobe fitting, they communicated together using notes written by her. Though she is seen speaking and is interviewed in the behind the scenes footage. Access Hollywood reported that a single sprinkler was used to produce rain in the music video. The concept of the music video was conceived by Clarkson. She explained, [...] "The whole thing is a metaphor about a broken fairy tale [...] You think <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> well, and then reality kicks your butt. It's kind of a sad video, but it's {{going to be my}} best one. It's real, and that's why people like me." [...] Clarkson also added that after the production of the music video was completed, she had bruises and a green-and-yellow splotch on her left biceps.

500|$|Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) – Victor is {{the main}} protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself {{constantly}} battling against all that life throws {{at him as he}} becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name [...] "Victor" [...] was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser. From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after his infamous replacement by a [...] "box" [...] at his place of employment, but to no avail. He believes that <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite façade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. [...] "Victor-isms" [...] include [...] "I do not believe it!", [...] "I don't believe it!", [...] "Un-be-lievable!", [...] "What in the name of bloody hell?", [...] "In the name of sanity!". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassionin [...] "Hearts of Darkness" [...] he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in [...] "Descent Into The Maelstrom" [...] he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 38 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says [...] "You were always my first choice", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode [...] "The Wisdom of the Witch" [...] in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, {{out the window of the}} house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.|$|E
