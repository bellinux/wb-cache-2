5|$|The telethon's {{talent pool}} becomes {{so low that}} Leslie is forced to <b>flip</b> <b>a</b> coin {{in front of the}} camera and talk about her {{favorite}} episodes of Friends. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is allowed to play the piano, but everyone dismisses his skilled playing as a racket. Mark finally returns to propose and walks on the set with the ring, but Leslie stops him by mooning the camera. Detlef Schrempf and Tom finally arrive at the end of Leslie's programming block. Detlef presents a check for $5,000, allowing the telethon to bypass its $20,000 mark. Despite being awake for two days straight, Leslie goes to Ann's house so they could talk about Mark. She then promptly falls asleep on Ann's couch for 22 hours.|$|E
5|$|When the U.S. entered World War II {{at the end}} of 1941, Lombard {{traveled}} to her home state of Indiana for a war bond rally with her mother, Bess Peters, and Clark Gable's press agent, Otto Winkler. Lombard was able to raise over $2 million ($35 million in 2016) in defense bonds in a single evening. Her party had initially been scheduled to return to Los Angeles by train, but Lombard was anxious to reach home more quickly and wanted to fly by a scheduled airline. Her mother and Winkler were both afraid of flying and insisted they follow their original travel plans. Lombard suggested they <b>flip</b> <b>a</b> coin; they agreed and Lombard won the toss.|$|E
50|$|Events are collectively {{exhaustive}} if all {{the possibilities}} for outcomes are exhausted by those possible events, so {{at least one of}} those outcomes must occur. The probability {{that at least one of}} the events will occur is equal to one. For example, there are theoretically only two possibilities for <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> coin. <b>Flipping</b> <b>a</b> head and <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> tail are collectively exhaustive events, and there is a probability of one of <b>flipping</b> either <b>a</b> head or a tail. Events can be both mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. In the case of <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> coin, <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> head and <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> tail are also mutually exclusive events. Both outcomes cannot occur for a single trial (i.e., when <b>a</b> coin is <b>flipped</b> only once). The probability of <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> head and the probability of <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> tail can be added to yield a probability of 1: 1/2 + 1/2 =1.|$|R

5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is the Westernized {{release of}} the puzzle game Puyo Puyo and replaces all of its {{characters}} with those from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. The entirety of gameplay takes place across two grid-based boards: the left board {{is used by the}} player, while the right board is controlled by either artificial intelligence or a second player, depending on the game mode. The main objective of the game is to earn as many points as possible by grouping the same coloured beans together as they fall down on the board. The player must arrange beans into groups of at least four of the same colour; should they do this, the beans in the group will disappear and points will be accumulated. If the player drops a group of beans on an uneven surface, any bean left hanging will separate from the original group and will drop to the lowest point on the board. The player may also <b>flip</b> <b>a</b> group of falling beans horizontally or vertically.|$|E

25|$|Entropy {{is defined}} {{in the context of}} a {{probabilistic}} model. Independent fair coin flips have an entropy of 1 bit per <b>flip.</b> <b>A</b> source that always generates a long string of B's has an entropy of 0, since the next character will always be a 'B'.|$|E
5000|$|We can {{see from}} the above that, if one <b>flips</b> <b>a</b> fair coin 21 times, then the {{probability}} of 21 heads is 1 in 2,097,152. However, the probability of <b>flipping</b> <b>a</b> head after having already flipped 20 heads in a row is simply [...] This is an application of Bayes' theorem.|$|R

25|$|A second Blenheim, V6000, became {{available}} for additional testing. The team {{began to use}} this aircraft as a testbed for alternate scanning solutions, leaving the original N3522 with the spiral-scan system. One of the first tests was to use a manual scanning system {{in place of the}} spiral or helical systems, allowing the operator to scan the sky using controls on his receiver sets. Once a target was found, they could <b>flip</b> <b>a</b> switch and the system would track that target automatically from that point. After considerable effort, they decided this concept simply didn't work, and that the mechanical scanning systems were a better solution.|$|E
25|$|In March 2010, Kim competed at the 2010 World Championships in Turin, Italy. Kim {{said she}} had {{struggled}} with finding the motivation to compete at the World Championships after winning the {{gold medal at the}} Olympic Games. Kim placed seventh in the short program with 60.30 points. She opened with a triple lutz–triple toe loop combination, but had problems with her layback spin and spiral sequence after unseen problems with her boots. She rebounded in the free skate to win the program with 130.49 points completing a triple lutz–triple toe loop combination, a triple <b>flip,</b> <b>a</b> double axel–double toe loop–double loop combination, a double axel–triple toe loop combination and a triple lutz, but having trouble with her triple salchow and double axel. She won the silver medal totaling 190.79 points.|$|E
25|$|In January 2013 due to {{her lack}} of {{competition}} in the previous season, Kim had {{to compete in the}} 2013 South Korean Championships to pick herself a spot for the 2013 World Championships. She placed first in the short program with a score of 64.97 points despite having some problems in that segment of the competition. She also won the free skate totaling 145.80 after performing a clean program where she executed a triple lutz–triple toe loop combination, a triple <b>flip,</b> <b>a</b> triple salchow, a triple lutz, a double axel–double toe loop–double loop combination, a triple salchow–double toe loop combination and a double axel. Her total score of 210.77 points was 48.89 ahead of silver medalist Park So-youn. As a result, Kim won her fifth national title and thus qualified to compete in the World Championships.|$|E

25|$|On February 25, she won {{the free}} skate with a new record of 150.06 points. Kim landed a triple lutz–triple toe loop combination, a triple <b>flip,</b> <b>a</b> double axel–double toe loop–double loop combination, a double axel–triple toe loop combination, a triple salchow, a triple lutz and a double axel as well as {{receiving}} level fours for her spins and her spiral sequence. Both her technical score of 78.30 and her presentation of 71.76 were the highest of the night. She was the only competitor to earn nines in her program components scores. She set a new world record for the free skate under the ISU Judging System. Overall, Kim totaled 228.56 points, shattering her personal best and own old world record {{by a margin of}} 18 points and will have become the longest standing record performance in the current ISU Judging System. She won the gold medal, becoming the first South Korean skater to medal in any discipline of figure skating at the Olympic Games. She also set a new Olympic record. Kim's gold medal was South Korea's first medal at the Winter Olympics in a sport other than speed skating or short track.|$|E
25|$|The {{labelled}} {{product is}} generated via reverse transcription and sometimes with an optional PCR amplification. The RNA is reverse transcribed with either polyT primers (which amplify only mRNA) or random primers (which amplify all RNA, {{most of which}} is rRNA); miRNA microarrays ligate an oligonucleotide to the purified small RNA (isolated with a fractionator), which is then reverse transcribed and amplified. The label is added either during the reverse transcription step, or following amplification if it is performed. The sense labelling {{is dependent on the}} microarray; e.g. if the label is added with the RT mix, the cDNA is antisense and the microarray probe is sense, except in the case of negative controls. The label is typically fluorescent; only one machine uses radiolabels. The labelling can be direct (not used) or indirect (requires a coupling stage). For two-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs before hybridization, using aminoallyl uridine triphosphate (aminoallyl-UTP, or aaUTP) and NHS amino-reactive dyes (such as cyanine dyes); for single-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs after hybridization, using biotin and labelled streptavidin. The modified nucleotides (usually in a ratio of 1 aaUTP: 4 TTP (thymidine triphosphate)) are added enzymatically in a low ratio to normal nucleotides, typically resulting in 1 every 60 bases. The aaDNA is then purified with a column (using a phosphate buffer solution, as Tris contains amine groups). The aminoallyl group is an amine group on a long linker attached to the nucleobase, which reacts with a reactive dye. A form of replicate known as a dye flip can be performed to remove any dye effects in two-channel experiments; for a dye <b>flip,</b> <b>a</b> second slide is used, with the labels swapped (the sample that was labeled with Cy3 in the first slide is labeled with Cy5, and vice versa). In this example, aminoallyl-UTP is present in the reverse-transcribed mixture.|$|E

This was identified as an exaggerated misconception as early as 1966. Observational studies show that fishers will make repeated biting attacks on the face of a porcupine and kill it after about 25–30 minutes.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{priorities}} for Goldwyn was to shorten {{the length of the}} show to at least three hours or less.
