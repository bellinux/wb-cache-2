25|$|During World War I, President Woodrow Wilson {{asked the}} Intercontinental Rubber Company—owned by Bernard Baruch, J. P. Morgan and Kennedy—to grow <b>guayule.</b> <b>Guayule</b> is {{a plant that}} {{produces}} latex {{that can be used}} to make rubber. Many feared the German navy might blockade rubber shipments from Asia. As a result, Intercontinental established the Continental Farm and the little town of Continental in southeastern Arizona in 1916. The <b>guayule</b> growing operations didn't last and in 1922 the Continental Farm was sold to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, who rented the fields to cotton farmers for several years.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} from ethanol production is {{primarily in the}} fermentation of the feedstock and minor changes in distillation. The feedstocks {{are the same as}} for ethanol: energy crops such as sugar beets, sugar cane, corn grain, wheat and cassava, prospective non-food energy crops such as switchgrass and even <b>guayule</b> in North America, as well as agricultural byproducts such as bagasse, straw and corn stalks. According to DuPont, existing bioethanol plants can cost-effectively be retrofitted to biobutanol production.|$|E
40|$|The {{cytokinin}} benzylaminopurine strongly stimulated shoot growth, and {{the number}} of regenerated buds on the inoculum was proportional to its concentration. These buds produced shoots several centimeters in length which were caused to root on medium containing indolebutyric acid. Transferred to the septic condition of soil, the plantlets were gradually brought into full sunlight where they showed a brief vegetative growth with production of mature type leaves, and flowered. In contrast, seedlings of the same age remained vegetative. Chromosome studies of root smears from the tissue cultured plantlets showed that 2 n = 36, the normal number for sexually reproducing <b>guayules...</b>|$|R
25|$|Many {{other plants}} produce forms of latex rich in {{isoprene}} polymers, {{though not all}} produce usable forms of polymer as easily as the Pará. Some of them require more elaborate processing to produce anything like usable rubber, and most {{are more difficult to}} tap. Some produce other desirable materials, for example gutta-percha (Palaquium gutta) and chicle from Manilkara species. Others that have been commercially exploited, or at least showed promise as rubber sources, include the rubber fig (Ficus elastica), Panama rubber tree (Castilla elastica), various spurges (Euphorbia spp.), lettuce (Lactuca species), the related Scorzonera tau-saghyz, various Taraxacum species, including common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and Russian dandelion (Taraxacum kok-saghyz), and perhaps most importantly for its hypoallergenic properties, <b>guayule</b> (Parthenium argentatum). The term gum rubber is sometimes applied to the tree-obtained version of natural rubber in order to distinguish it from the synthetic version.|$|E
25|$|Madero {{was born}} in Parras de la Fuente, Coahuila, the first son of Francisco Ignacio Madero Hernández and Mercedes González Treviño, the first {{grandson}} of family patriarch, Evaristo Madero. He was sickly as a child, and was small in stature as an adult. It is widely believed that Madero's middle initial, I, stood for Indalecio, but according to his birth certificate it stood for Ygnacio. His family {{was one of the}} wealthiest families in Mexico: his grandfather, Evaristo Madero, had relatively humble origins as founder of a regional carting business, but he took advantage of economic opportunity and transported cotton from Texas during the U.S. Civil War and built a diversified fortune. He founded the Compañía Industrial de Parras, initially involved in vineyards, cotton, and textiles, and later also in mining, cotton mills, ranching, banking, coal, <b>guayule</b> rubber, and foundries in the later part of the nineteenth century. For many years, the family prospered during Porfirio Díaz's regime, and by 1910 the family was one of the ten richest in Mexico, worth 30 million pesos ($15 million U.S. dollars). His grandfather Evaristo served as governor of Coahuila from 1880-1884, during the four-year interregnum of Porfirio Díaz's rule, but was permanently sidelined from political office when Díaz returned to the presidency in 1884 and served until 1911. Evaristo married twice and had 14 children who lived to adulthood, including Francisco I. Madero, Sr., father of the future president. Thus, young Francisco {{was a member of a}} huge and powerful northern Mexican family with long-standing issues with the Díaz regime.|$|E
500|$|Manzanar {{also had}} a {{camouflage}} net factory, an experimental plantation for producing natural rubber from the <b>Guayule</b> plant, and an orphanage called Children's Village, which housed 101 Japanese American orphans. [...] The camp perimeter had eight watchtowers manned by armed Military Police, and it was enclosed by five-strand barbed wire. There were sentry posts at the main entrance.|$|E
500|$|SRI's first {{research}} project investigated whether the <b>guayule</b> plant {{could be used}} as a source of natural rubber. During World War II, rubber was imported into the U.S. and was subject to shortages and strict rationing. From 1942 to 1946, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) supported a project to create a domestic source of natural rubber. [...] Once the war ended, the United States Congress cut funding for the program; in response, the Office of Naval Research created a grant for the project to continue at SRI, and the USDA staff on the project worked through SRI until Congress reauthorized funding in 1947.|$|E
2500|$|The Porfirio Díaz era {{at the end}} of the 19th {{century and}} {{beginning}} of the 20th was initially thwarted by regional bosses called caciques, bolstered by a wave of Spanish and mestizo farmers who migrated to the state and added to the elite group of wealthy landowning families. There was some technological progress such as a highway from San Cristóbal to the Oaxaca border and the first telephone line in the 1880s, but Porfirian era economic reforms would not begin until 1891 with Governor Emilio Rabasa. This governor took on the local and regional caciques and centralized power into the state capital, which he moved from San Cristóbal de las Casas to Tuxtla in 1892. [...] He modernized public administration, transportation and promoted education. Rabasa also introduced telegraph, limited public schooling, sanitation and road construction, including a route from San Cristóbal to Tuxtla then Oaxaca, which signaled the beginning of favoritism of development in the central valley over the highlands. He also changed state policies to favor foreign investment, favored large land mass consolidation for the production of cash crops such as henequen, rubber, <b>guayule,</b> cochineal and coffee. Agricultural production boomed, especially coffee, which induced the construction of port facilities in Tonalá. The economic expansion and investment in roads also increased access to tropical commodities such as hardwoods, rubber and chicle.|$|E
50|$|Currently, PanAridus and Yulex are {{the only}} {{commercial}} producers of <b>guayule</b> natural rubber in the world. Yulex have partnered with Patagonia who are now making its Yulex wetsuit from <b>Guayule</b> derived plant stems in a 60/40 blend (60% <b>guayule,</b> 40% neoprene), reducing dependence on conventional neoprene.|$|E
50|$|Recently, the <b>guayule</b> {{plant has}} seen {{a small but growing}} {{resurgence}} in research and agriculture due to its hypoallergenic properties. While Hevea-derived rubber contains proteins that can cause severe allergic reactions in a few people, <b>guayule</b> does not. With the AIDS crisis of the 1980s, the surge in rubber glove usage revealed how many people were allergic to latex (about 10% of health care workers, according to OSHA), and thereby created a niche market for <b>guayule.</b> There are synthetic alternatives for medical device products, but they are not as stretchable as natural rubber. <b>Guayule</b> performs like Hevea but contains none of the proteins that cause latex allergies.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout World War II, {{the allied}} forces {{suffered}} from a shortage of latex rubber, due to Japan cutting off America's access to the Maylasian rubber plantations. Spence, along with other allied scientists, scrambled to secure another natural rubber resource. Latex derived from Parthenium argentatum, more commonly called <b>Guayule,</b> was an ideal candidate as a replacement rubber due to {{the properties of the}} vulcanized rubber produced from <b>Guayule,</b> which were similar to the rubber produced from Maylasian rubber plantations. [...] Latex from <b>Guayule</b> was first prepared in 1876, via a solvent extraction of the latex using acetone, and this extraction process was used commercially by the Diamond Rubber Company up until the 1930s. [...] However, the acetone extraction process was too expensive to meet the large rubber demand brought on by World War II, creating a push to develop more conventional mechanical processing methods to extract the latex. [...] A significant production challenge in the production of latex from <b>Guayule</b> was that both the mass of the latex extracted, and the tensile strength of latex, fell off due to the long storage time between the harvesting of the <b>Guayule</b> and its processing. [...] Spence was tasked by Intercontinental Rubber to solve this challenge.Spence patented methodologies to both improve the quality and yield of rubber produced from <b>Guayule</b> via conventional mechanical techniques in 1933. [...] Upon investigation, Spence determined that the drying of the <b>Guayule</b> was responsible for the high variability in both the yield and quality of the latex. [...] Spence's retting processes of handling the <b>Guayule</b> shrub increased both the uniformity of the yield and the quality of rubber extracted from the <b>Guayule</b> plant. The retting process included soaking a crushed <b>Guayule</b> plant in a 1% para-dimethylphenylamine solution, in order for natural occurring bacteria and enzymes to decompose unwanted plant material into water-soluble by-products, and to prevent the oxidative loss of the plant's natural rubber. These by-products could then be washed away during the milling process. [...] The retting process improved the milling extraction process of <b>Guayule</b> upwards of six percent, and improved the tensile strength from 1800-2000 psi upwards of 2800 psi, a tensile strength comparable to that of the rubber trees.|$|E
50|$|In October 2015, the Bridgestone Corporation {{announced}} {{the creation of}} the first tires made entirely of <b>guayule</b> rubber, having built an experimental farm and biorubber research center in Mesa, Arizona the previous year. The <b>guayule</b> is grown in Mesa and Eloy, Arizona.|$|E

5000|$|During World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army {{captured}} {{most of the}} world's rubber plantations in British Malaya, {{causing a}} natural rubber shortage shortage for the Allied armies.Natural rubber came from the rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis, a native of South America that was commercially grown in Southeast Asia. The United States government established a research program to develop synthetic rubber, and also encouraged research into botanical alternatives. <b>Guayule,</b> whose sap {{could be used to}} produce latex, was considered a possible substitute for rubber. [...] Galston was recommended to James F. Bonner by H. E. Carter, and spent a year working with Bonner at Caltech in Pasadena, California to develop rubber tires from <b>guayule.</b> By the end of 1944, the U.S. had achieved success with synthetic, petroleum-based rubber, and interest in <b>guayule</b> research lessened.|$|E

50|$|In the 1920s, {{the plant}} saw a brief and intense amount of {{agricultural}} research when the Intercontinental Rubber Company in California produced 1400 tons of rubber after leaf blight decimated the Brazilian rubber industry. <b>Guayule</b> would again become {{a replacement for}} Hevea tree-produced latex during World War II when Japan cut off America's Malaysian latex resources. The war ended before large-scale farming of the <b>guayule</b> plant began, and the project was scrapped, as it was cheaper to import tree-derived latex than to crush the shrubs for a smaller amount of latex.|$|E
50|$|Seeking {{alternative}} sources of natural rubber, the U.S. Government purchased the Intercontinental Rubber Company's holdings in California, and also began the commercial scale up of polybutadiene and styrene butadiene rubber. Over 32,000 acres of <b>guayule</b> were commercially farmed in California and Arizona. While the yields from those stands of plants were not sufficient to be commercially viable, the demands of war supported the concept of rubber production at any cost and demonstrated guayule's excellent performance characteristics in a broad variety of applications.The U.S. Government abandoned <b>guayule</b> production efforts following the war.|$|E

5000|$|Guayule's {{viability}} as {{a potential}} biofuel has been enhanced recently in light of commentary {{from a variety of}} experts, including Lester R. Brown of the Earth Policy Institute, stating that [...] "based biofuels pit the 800 million people with cars against the 800 million people with hunger problems," [...] meaning that biofuels derived from food crops (like maize) raise world food prices. <b>Guayule</b> can be an economically viable biofuel crop that does not increase the world's hunger problem. <b>Guayule</b> has another benefit over food crops as biofuel - it can be grown in areas where food crops would fail.|$|E
