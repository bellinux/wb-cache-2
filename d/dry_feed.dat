Primary cecal impactions usually consist of <b>dry</b> <b>feed</b> material, with the horse slowly developing clinical signs over several days. Secondary cecal impactions may occur post-surgery, orthopedic or otherwise, and the cecum does not function properly.

The cecum quickly distends due to fluid and gas accumulation, often leading to rupture within 24–48 hours if not corrected.

For these reasons, {{this study was conducted}} to evaluate the effects of feeding method in lactating sows. Methods A total of 30 mixed-parity (average 4. 13) lactating sows (Yorkshire[*]×[*]Landrace) with an initial BW of 218. 8 [*]±[*] 19. 5 kg was used in a 3 week trial. Sows were allotted to 1 of 2 treatments in a completely randomized design by their body weight, backfat thickness, parity and alive litter weight. One of treatments was <b>dry</b> <b>feeding</b> and the other was liquid feeding (water to feed ratio, 1 : 1). Experimental diets contained 3265 kcal ME/kg, 12. 6 % CP, 5. 76 % EE, 1. 09 % total lysine, 0. 25 % total methionine, as fed basis. Results <b>Dry</b> <b>feeding</b> treatment had high body weight loss rather than liquid feeding treatment (P[*]=[*] 0. 04). <b>Dry</b> <b>feeding</b> treatment had tendency to increase litter weight at 21 d of lactation (P[*]=[*] 0. 06) and litter weight gain (P[*]=[*] 0. 04) during lactation period (0 – 3 week). Sows fed <b>dry</b> <b>feeding</b> method made milk containing high content of casein and total solid rather than sows fed liquid feeding method (P[*]=[*] 0. 04). In addition, <b>dry</b> <b>feeding</b> treatment had tendency to higher content of milk fat, protein and solid not fat on 21 d of lactation (P[*]=[*] 0. 07). Sows fed <b>dry</b> <b>feeding</b> type also showed higher milk energy content in milk of 21 d lactation (P[*]=[*] 0. 05). Furthermore, liquid feeding treatment showed high occurrence in feed waste during lactation period (P[*]<[*] 0. 01).

The farm chilled its milk within two minutes of milking to , often limiting its bacteria counts to 200–400 per cc. A chemical analysis of the milk was performed every month; although regulations required a minimum of three percent butterfat, Briarcliff required its milk to have over five percent butterfat to be sold.

40|$|The goats {{raised in}} the barn are usually fed on fresh grass.

This review explains the physiological factors involved in suppressing dry forage intake and the cause of drinking following <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding.</b> Ruminants consume an enormous amount of dry forage in a short time. Eating rates of dry forage rapidly decreased in the first 40 min of feeding and subsequently declined gradually to low states in the remaining time of the feeding period. Saliva in large-type goats is secreted in large volume during the first hour after the commencement of <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding.</b> It was elucidated that the marked suppression of dry forage intake during the first hour was caused by a feeding-induced hypovolemia and the loss of NaHCO 3 due to excessive salivation during the initial stages of <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding.</b> On the other hand, it was indicated that the marked decrease in feed intake observed in the second hour of the 2 h feeding period was related to ruminal distension caused by the feed consumed and the copious amount of saliva secreted during <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding.</b> In addition, results indicate that the marked decreases in dry forage intake after 40 min of feeding are caused by increases in plasma osmolality and subsequent thirst sensations produced by <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding.</b> After 40 min of the 2 h <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding</b> period, the feed salt content is absorbed into the rumen and plasma osmolality increases. The combined effects of ruminal distension and increased plasma osmolality accounted for 77. 6 % of the suppression of dry forage intake 40 min after the start of <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding.</b> The results indicate that ruminal distension and increased plasma osmolality are the main physiological factors in suppression of dry forage intake in large-type goats. There was very little drinking behavior observed during the first hour of the 2 h feeding period most water consumption occurring in the second hour. The cause of this thirst sensation during the second hour of <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding</b> period was not hypovolemia brought about by excessive salivation, but rather increases in plasma osmolality due to the ruminal absorption of salt from the consumed feed.
