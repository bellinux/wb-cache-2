5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could be made that would <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> the {{statement is}} false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, it {{has been}} <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> Hsp 70 is {{released}} in the extracellular space under normal cell culture conditions, and this release is mediated through exosomes. We have <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> A 6 cells, a clone of mouse mesoangioblasts, produce and release in the extracellular space membrane vesicles, independently of culture growth conditions. These vesicles contains both structural proteins and biological active molecules, such as FGF- 2 and the metalloproteinases MMP 2 and 9. We have also <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> A 6 vesicles contain HspP 70 and its release is highly regulated. Some of the intracellular Hsp 70 is localized on lipid rafts and its concentration in insoluble fraction increases after heat shock. Vesicle shedding is influenced by lipid raft integrity, but not so Hsp 70 release. Recent experiments have <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> A 6 vesicles also contain urokinase and tissue-type plasminogen activators (uPA and tPA), both responsible of plasmin activation. These two proteins could be responsible for MMP activation, as reported in other cell lines. Recently {{it has been}} <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> MMP 9 expression depends on Hsp 70, through NF-kB and AP 1 activation. Our preliminary data <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> NM 3 cells, a clone with a 55...|$|R
