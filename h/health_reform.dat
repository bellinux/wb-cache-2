5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the {{psychiatric}} reform that had been implemented by Franco Basaglia in Italy became known and was publicly declared to be implemented in Russia, with the view of retrenchment of expenditures. But {{when it became clear that}} even more money was needed for the reform, it got bogged down in the same way the reform of the army and many other undertakings did. Russia is decades behind the countries of the European Union in mental <b>health</b> <b>reform,</b> which has already been implemented or is being implemented in them. Until Russian society, Gushansky says, is aware of the need for mental <b>health</b> <b>reform,</b> we will live in the atmosphere of animosity, mistrust and violence. Many experts believe that problems spread beyond psychiatry to society as a whole. As Robert van Voren supposes, the Russians want to have their compatriots with mental disorders locked up outside the city and do not want to have them in community. Despite the 1992 Russian Mental Health Law, coercive psychiatry in Russia remains generally unregulated and fashioned by the same trends toward hyperdiagnosis and overreliance on institutional care characteristic of the Soviet period. In the Soviet Union, there had been an increase of the bed numbers because psychiatric services had been used to treat dissidents.|$|E
5|$|Health care in Turkey {{used to be}} {{dominated}} by a centralised state system run by the Ministry of Health. In 2003, the government introduced a sweeping <b>health</b> <b>reform</b> programme aimed at increasing the ratio of private to state health provision and making healthcare available to a larger share of the population. Turkish Statistical Institute announced that 76.3 billion TL was spent for healthcare in 2012; 79.6 percent of which was covered by the Social Security Institution and 15.4 percent of which was paid directly by the patients. In 2012, there were 29,960 medical institutions in Turkey, and on average one doctor per 583 people and 2.65 beds per 1000 people.|$|E

25|$|Early in 1866, {{responding}} to the instruction given to White on Christmas Day in 1865 that Seventh-day Adventists should establish a health institute {{for the care of}} the sick and the imparting of health instruction, plans were laid for the Western <b>Health</b> <b>Reform</b> Institute, which opened in September, 1866.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the implementation of}} mental <b>health</b> <b>reforms</b> in Britain and Italy since the 1950 s from a geographical perspective. Both countries have experienced the policies of deinstitutionalisation and community care, yet the timing, methods and outcomes of implementation have varied considerably, both between the countries and within them. This situation suggests that underlying social, political, economic and cultural differences have been important influences on {{the implementation of the}} respective mental <b>health</b> <b>reforms,</b> and this is a theme that is considered throughout the thesis. The research was conducted at three levels of enquiry: firstly by comparing the implementation of mental <b>health</b> <b>reforms</b> at the national scale in Britain and Italy, looking in particular at the influence of politics and place; secondly by focusing upon the implementation of the reforms in two cities, for which Sheffield and Verona were selected; thirdly a case study approach was adopted in order to study in greater detail one community-based mental health service in each city. It was at this level of enquiry that the more intensive research was carried out, in the form of two local resident questionnaire surveys, one in each city, and semi-structured interviews with mental health professionals from the two case study services. This research illustrates that the implementation of mental <b>health</b> <b>reforms</b> in Britain and Italy has led to a geographical unevenness in the distribution of community-based services at all spatial scales. However, the social, cultural and political contexts in which the reforms have occurred in the two countries have been quite different and therefore when contemplating direct comparisons between mental <b>health</b> <b>reforms</b> in Britain and Italy, the argument that 'place matters' is highly pertinent...|$|R

25|$|The {{beginnings}} of this health ministry {{are found in}} a vision that White had in 1863. The vision {{was said to have}} occurred during a visit by James and Ellen White to Otsego, Michigan to encourage the evangelistic workers there. As the group bowed in prayer at the beginning of Sabbath, Ellen White reportedly had a vision of the relation of physical health to spirituality, of the importance of following right principles in diet and in the care of the body, and of the benefits of nature's remedies—clean air, sunshine, exercise and pure water. Previous to this vision, little thought or time had been given to health matters in the church, and several of the overtaxed ministers had been forced to become inactive because of sickness. This revelation on June 6, 1863 impressed upon the leaders in the newly organized church the importance of <b>health</b> <b>reform.</b> In the months that followed, as the health message was seen {{to be a part of}} the message of Seventh-day Adventists, a health educational program was inaugurated. An introductory step in this effort was the publishing of six pamphlets of 64 pages each, entitled, Health, or How to Live, compiled by James and Ellen White. An article from White was included in each of the pamphlets. The importance of <b>health</b> <b>reform</b> was greatly impressed upon the early leaders of the church through the untimely death of Henry White at the age of 16, the severe illness of Elder James White, which forced him to cease work for three years, and through the sufferings of several other ministers.|$|E
