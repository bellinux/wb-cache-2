5|$|Scandium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Sc and atomic number 21. A silvery-white metallic d-block element, it {{has historically been}} classified as a rare earth element, together with yttrium and the lanthanides. It was discovered in 1879 by spectral analysis of the minerals euxenite and <b>gadolinite</b> from Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Scandium is {{distributed}} sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals. Rare minerals from Scandinavia and Madagascar such as <b>gadolinite,</b> euxenite, and thortveitite {{are the only}} known concentrated sources of this element, the latter containing up to 45% of scandium {{in the form of}} scandium(III) oxide. Yttrium has the same trend in occurrence places; it is found in lunar rock samples collected during the American Apollo Project in a relatively high content as well.|$|E
5|$|In Earth's crust, {{scandium}} is not rare. Estimates {{vary from}} 18 to 25ppm, which {{is comparable to}} the abundance of cobalt (20–30ppm). Scandium is only the 50th most common element on Earth (35th most abundant in the crust), but it is the 23rd most common element in the Sun. However, scandium is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals. Rare minerals from Scandinavia and Madagascar such as thortveitite, euxenite, and <b>gadolinite</b> are the only known concentrated sources of this element. Thortveitite can contain up to 45% of scandium in the form of scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|While {{dysprosium}} {{is never}} encountered {{as a free}} element, it is found in many minerals, including xenotime, fergusonite, <b>gadolinite,</b> euxenite, polycrase, blomstrandine, monazite and bastnäsite; often with erbium and holmium or other rare earth elements. Currently, most dysprosium is being obtained from the ion-adsorption clay ores of southern China, and future sources will include the Halls Creek region in Western Australia. In the high-yttrium version of these, dysprosium {{happens to be the}} most abundant of the heavy lanthanides, comprising up to 7–8% of the concentrate (as compared to about 65% for yttrium). The concentration of Dy in the Earth's crust is about 5.2mg/kg and in sea water 0.9ng/L.|$|E
5|$|Samarium was {{discovered}} in 1879 by the French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran and named after the mineral samarskite from which it was isolated. The mineral itself was earlier named after a Russian mine official, Colonel Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets, who thereby became {{the first person to}} have a chemical element named after him, albeit indirectly. Although classified as a rare-earth element, samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and is more common than such metals as tin. Samarium occurs with concentration up to 2.8% in several minerals including cerite, <b>gadolinite,</b> samarskite, monazite and bastnäsite, the last two being the most common commercial sources of the element. These minerals are mostly found in China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia; China is by far the world leader in samarium mining and production.|$|E
5|$|The {{element is}} never {{found in nature}} in pure form, but it is found in small {{quantities}} in minerals with other rare earths. Thulium is often found with minerals containing yttrium and gadolinium. In particular, thulium occurs in the mineral <b>gadolinite.</b> However, thulium also occurs in the minerals monazite, xenotime, and euxenite. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is 0.5mg/kg by weight and 50 parts per billion by moles. Thulium makes up approximately 0.5 parts per million of soil, although this value can range from 0.4 to 0.8 parts per million. Thulium makes up 250 parts per quadrillion of seawater. In the solar system, thulium exists in concentrations of 200 parts per trillion by weight and 1part per trillion by moles. Thulium ore occurs most commonly in China. However, Australia, Brazil, Greenland, India, Tanzania, and the United States also have large reserves of thulium. Total reserves of thulium are approximately 100,000 tonnes. Thulium is the least abundant lanthanide on earth except for promethium.|$|E
5|$|Samarium is {{not found}} free in nature, but, like other rare earth elements, is {{contained}} in many minerals, including monazite, bastnäsite, cerite, <b>gadolinite</b> and samarskite; monazite (in which samarium occurs at concentrations of up to 2.8%) and bastnäsite are mostly used as commercial sources. World resources of samarium are estimated at two million tonnes; they are mostly located in China, US, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia, and the annual production is about 700 tonnes. Country production reports are usually given for all rare-earth metals combined. By far, China has the largest production with 120,000 tonnes mined per year; it {{is followed by the}} US (about 5,000tonnes) and India (2,700tonnes). Samarium is usually sold as oxide, which at the price of about 30USD/kg is one of the cheapest lanthanide oxides. Whereas mischmetal – a mixture of rare earth metals containing about 1% of samarium – has long been used, relatively pure samarium has been isolated only recently, through ion exchange processes, solvent extraction techniques, and electrochemical deposition. The metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of samarium(III) chloride with sodium chloride or calcium chloride. Samarium can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with lanthanum. The product is then distilled to separate samarium (boiling point 1794°C) and lanthanum (b.p.3464°C).|$|E
25|$|Holmium oxide {{occurs in}} trace amounts in the {{minerals}} <b>gadolinite,</b> monazite, {{and in other}} rare-earth minerals. Holmium metal readily oxidizes in air; therefore presence of holmium in nature is synonymous with that of holmia. With the abundance of 1.4mg/kg, holmium is the 56th most abundant element. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia with reserves of holmium oxide estimated as 400,000 tonnes.|$|E
25|$|For the {{elements}} up to 92 (uranium), naming elements after people was discouraged. The two exceptions are indirect, {{the elements}} being named after minerals that were themselves named after people. These were gadolinium (found in <b>gadolinite,</b> {{named after the}} Finnish chemist Johan Gadolin) and samarium (the mineral samarskite was named after a Russian mining engineer, Vasili Samarsky-Bykhovets). Among the transuranium elements, this restriction was relaxed, there followed curium (after the Curies), einsteinium, fermium (Enrico Fermi), mendelevium (Dmitri Mendeleev), nobelium, and lawrencium (after Ernest Lawrence).|$|E
25|$|Well-known {{minerals}} containing yttrium include <b>gadolinite,</b> xenotime, samarskite, euxenite, fergusonite, yttrotantalite, yttrotungstite, yttrofluorite (a {{variety of}} fluorite), thalenite, yttrialite. Small amounts occur in zircon, which derives its typical yellow fluorescence {{from some of}} the accompanying heavy lanthanides. The zirconium mineral eudialyte, such as is found in southern Greenland, contains small but potentially useful amounts of yttrium. Of the above yttrium minerals, most played a part in providing research quantities of lanthanides during the discovery days. Xenotime is occasionally recovered as a byproduct of heavy-sand processing, but is not as abundant as the similarly recovered monazite (which typically contains a few percent of yttrium). Uranium ores from Ontario have occasionally yielded yttrium as a byproduct.|$|E
25|$|Despite their name, rare-earth {{elements}} are – {{with the exception}} of the radioactive promethium – relatively plentiful in Earth's crust, with cerium being the 25th most abundant element at 68 parts per million, or as abundant as copper. They are not especially rare, but they tend to occur together in nature and are difficult to separate from one another. However, because of their geochemical properties, rare-earth {{elements are}} typically dispersed and not often found concentrated as rare-earth minerals in economically exploitable ore deposits. The first such mineral discovered was <b>gadolinite,</b> a mineral composed of cerium, yttrium, iron, silicon and other elements. This mineral was extracted from a mine in the village of Ytterby in Sweden; four of the rare-earth elements bear names derived from this single location.|$|E
500|$|Ytterbium was {{discovered}} by the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in the year 1878. While examining samples of <b>gadolinite,</b> Marignac found a new component in the earth then known as erbia, and he named it ytterbia, for Ytterby, the Swedish village near where he found the new component of erbium. Marignac suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called [...] "ytterbium".|$|E
500|$|Dmitri Mendeleev, who is {{referred}} to as the father of the periodic table, predicted the existence of an element ekaboron, with an atomic mass between 40 and 48 in 1869. Lars Fredrik Nilson and his team detected this element in the minerals euxenite and <b>gadolinite.</b> Nilson prepared 2grams of scandium oxide of high purity. He named the element scandium, from the Latin Scandia meaning [...] "Scandinavia". Nilson was apparently unaware of Mendeleev's prediction, but Per Teodor Cleve recognized the correspondence and notified Mendeleev.|$|E
500|$|In 1843, Carl Gustaf Mosander {{found that}} samples of yttria {{contained}} three oxides: white yttrium oxide (yttria), yellow terbium oxide (confusingly, this was called 'erbia' at the time) and rose-colored erbium oxide (called 'terbia' at the time). A fourth oxide, ytterbium oxide, was isolated in 1878 by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac. New elements were later isolated {{from each of}} those oxides, and each element was named, in some fashion, after Ytterby, the village near the quarry where they were found (see ytterbium, terbium, and erbium). In the following decades, seven other new metals were discovered in [...] "Gadolin's yttria". Since yttria {{was found to be}} a mineral and not an oxide, Martin Heinrich Klaproth renamed it <b>gadolinite</b> in honor of Gadolin.|$|E
500|$|In 1869, Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev {{published}} his periodic table, which had empty spaces for elements directly above and under yttrium. Mendeleev made several predictions {{on the upper}} neighbor of yttrium, which he called eka-boron. [...] Swedish chemist Lars Fredrik Nilson and his team discovered the missing element in the minerals euxenite and <b>gadolinite</b> and prepared 2grams of scandium(III) oxide of high purity. He named it scandium, from the Latin Scandia meaning [...] "Scandinavia". Chemical experiments on the element proved that Mendeleev's suggestions were correct; along with discovery and characterization of gallium and germanium this proved the correctness of the whole periodic table and periodic law. Nilson was apparently unaware of Mendeleev's prediction, but Per Teodor Cleve recognized the correspondence and notified Mendeleev. Metallic scandium was produced {{for the first time}} in 1937 by electrolysis of a eutectic mixture, at 700–800°C, of potassium, lithium, and scandium chlorides.|$|E
500|$|Rhenium ( [...] meaning: [...] "Rhine") was the last-discovered of the {{elements}} that have a stable isotope (other new elements discovered in nature since then, such as francium, are radioactive). The existence of a yet-undiscovered element at this position in the periodic table had been first predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev. Other calculated information was obtained by Henry Moseley in 1914. It is generally considered to have been discovered by Walter Noddack, Ida Tacke, and Otto Berg in Germany. In 1925 they {{reported that they had}} detected the element in platinum ore and in the mineral columbite. They also found rhenium in <b>gadolinite</b> and molybdenite. In 1928 they were able to extract 1 g of the element by processing 660kg of molybdenite. It was estimated in 1968 that 75% of the rhenium metal in the United States was used for research and the development of refractory metal alloys. It took several years from that point before the superalloys became widely used.|$|E
500|$|In 1815, the Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius {{analysed}} {{an unusual}} sample of <b>gadolinite</b> from a copper mine in Falun, central Sweden. He noted impregnated traces {{of a white}} mineral, which he cautiously assumed to be an earth (oxide in modern chemical nomenclature) of an unknown element. Berzelius had already discovered two elements, cerium and selenium, but {{he had made a}} public mistake once, announcing a new element, gahnium, {{that turned out to be}} zinc oxide. Berzelius privately named the putative element [...] "thorium" [...] in 1817 and its supposed oxide [...] "thorina" [...] after Thor, the Norse god of thunder. In 1824, after more deposits of the same mineral in Vest-Agder, Norway, were discovered, he retracted his findings, as the mineral proved to be mostly yttrium orthophosphate. As the yttrium in this mineral was initially mistaken for a new element, the mineral was named kenotime by the French mineralogist François Sulpice Beudant as a rebuke of Berzelius, from the Greek words κενός (kenos; [...] "empty") and τιμή (timē; [...] "honour"). This became [...] "xenotime" [...] as a misprint from the beginning, blunting the criticism. This misspelt form was later explained as being from ξένος (xenos; [...] "alien") and τιμή, supposedly in reference to the small, rare and easily overlooked crystals that xenotime occurs as.|$|E
2500|$|Rare-earth {{elements}} {{became known}} to {{the world with the}} discovery of the black mineral [...] "ytterbite" [...] (renamed to <b>gadolinite</b> in 1800) by Lieutenant Carl Axel Arrhenius in 1787, at a quarry in the village of Ytterby, Sweden.|$|E
2500|$|In 1839 {{the third}} source for rare earths became available. This is a mineral similar to <b>gadolinite,</b> uranotantalum (now called [...] "samarskite"). This mineral from Miass in the {{southern}} Ural Mountains was documented by Gustave Rose. The Russian chemist R. Harmann proposed that a new element he called [...] "ilmenium" [...] should be present in this mineral, but later, Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand, Galissard de Marignac, and Heinrich Rose found only tantalum and niobium (columbium) in it.|$|E
2500|$|Arrhenius's [...] "ytterbite" [...] reached Johan Gadolin, a Royal Academy of Turku professor, and his {{analysis}} yielded an unknown oxide (earth) {{that he called}} yttria. Anders Gustav Ekeberg isolated beryllium from the <b>gadolinite</b> but failed to recognize other elements that the ore contained. After this discovery in 1794 a mineral from Bastnäs near Riddarhyttan, Sweden, which {{was believed to be}} an iron–tungsten mineral, was re-examined by Jöns Jacob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger. In 1803 they obtained a white oxide and called it ceria. Martin Heinrich Klaproth independently discovered the same oxide and called it ochroia.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{elements}} which were discovered {{as a consequence}} of the lengthy analysis and breakdown of the ore <b>Gadolinite.</b> [...] As the ore was progressively analysed further, the residue was given the label thence ceria and thence lanthana and onwards to yttria, erbia, and terbia. [...] The list by date includes Cerium 58, Lanthanum 57, Erbium 68, Terbium 65, Yttrium 39, Ytterbium 70, Holmium 67, Thulium 69, Scandium 21, Praseodymium 59, Neodymium 60 and Dysprosium 66. [...] Several of these new elements were either discovered or isolated by Carl Gustaf Mosander in the 1830s and 1840s.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, {{among the}} {{anhydrous}} rare-earth phosphates, {{it is the}} tetragonal mineral xenotime that incorporates yttrium and the yttrium earths, whereas the monoclinic monazite phase incorporates cerium and the cerium earths preferentially. The smaller size of the yttrium group allows it a greater solid solubility in the rock-forming minerals that comprise Earth's mantle, and thus yttrium and the yttrium earths show less enrichment in Earth's crust relative to chondritic abundance than does cerium and the cerium earths. This has economic consequences: large ore bodies of the cerium earths are known {{around the world and}} are being exploited. Corresponding ore bodies for yttrium tend to be rarer, smaller, and less concentrated. Most of the current supply of yttrium originates in the [...] "ion-absorption clay" [...] ores of Southern China. Some versions provide concentrates containing about 65% yttrium oxide, with the heavy lanthanides being present in ratios reflecting the Oddo–Harkins rule: even-numbered heavy lanthanides at abundances of about 5% each, and odd-numbered lanthanides at abundances of about 1% each. Similar compositions are found in xenotime or <b>gadolinite.</b>|$|E

50|$|The mineral that Gadolin {{examined}} {{was named}} <b>gadolinite</b> in 1800. The element gadolinium and its oxide gadolinia were named after Gadolin by its discoverers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gadolinite</b> {{was named}} in 1800 for Johan Gadolin, the Finnish mineralogist-chemist who first {{isolated}} an oxide {{of the rare}} earth element yttrium from the mineral in 1792. The rare earth gadolinium was also named for him. However, <b>gadolinite</b> does not contain more than trace amounts of gadolinium. When Gadolin analyzed this mineral, he missed an opportunity to discover a second element: the element he thought was aluminium (alumina) was in fact beryllium (beryllia), an element that was not officially identified until 1798.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gadolinite</b> and {{euxenite}} {{are quite}} abundant and are future sources of yttrium sub group rare earths. At present, these elements are recovered from monazite concentrates (after recovery of ceria sub-group metals).|$|E

5000|$|Of the 47 {{minerals}} {{discovered at}} Barringer Hill, <b>gadolinite,</b> a radioactive form of yttria, triggered the most interest at the time. This greenish-black ore had previously only {{been found in}} small amounts in Russia and Norway. Because of its economic potential as a material for light filaments, both Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse attempted to obtain the hill, with the Piedmont Mining Company, which was owned by Edison, winning out in 1889. In 1903, German chemist Walther Nernst, who later became famous for discovering the Third Law of Thermodynamics, was working for Westinghouse when he developed a street light that used raw <b>gadolinite</b> as a filament. The mineral species rich in yttrium-erbium were more particularly sought after because thorium and uranium were not used in the [...] "glower" [...] of the Nernst lamp. The Nernst Lamp Company, a subsidy of Westinghouse, then bought Barringer Hill and began mining, extracting a few hundred pounds of ytrria minerals annually for a few years. Eventually, Nernst Lamp Company ceased operations as newer technologies surpassed the lamp. The seventy-three pound group of crystals (of <b>gadolinite),</b> found in March 1903, was the greatest [...] "find" [...] of record in this mineral; but just one year later, a mass of roughly crystallized <b>gadolinite</b> was found, partly imbedded in the bed-rock at {{the northeast corner of}} the hill, that measured thirty-six inches long, eleven inches (279 mm) thick at the widest part, and weighed a little over two hundred pounds. It was apparently free from alteration, had specific gravity of 4.28 (taken on a very pure fragment), had a bright green chatoyancy at certain angles, and was like glass in its broad obsidian-like conchoidal fracture.|$|E
50|$|It {{is found}} {{associated}} with <b>gadolinite.</b> It was first described in 1889 for an occurrence in the Rode Ranch pegmatite on Baringer Hill, Llano County, Texas. It {{has also been}} reported from the Suishouyama pegmatite on Honshū, Japan, and from occurrences in Norway and Sweden.|$|E

5000|$|Gadolinium {{is named}} from the mineral <b>gadolinite,</b> in turn named for Finnish chemist and {{geologist}} Johan Gadolin.In 1880, the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac observed the spectroscopic lines from gadolinium in samples of <b>gadolinite</b> (which actually contains relatively little gadolinium, {{but enough to}} show a spectrum), and in the separate mineral cerite. The latter mineral proved to contain far more of the element with the new spectral line. De Marignac eventually separated a mineral oxide from cerite which he realized was the oxide of this new element. He named the oxide [...] "gadolinia." [...] Because he realized that [...] "gadolinia" [...] was the oxide of a new element, he is credited with discovery of gadolinium. The French chemist Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran carried out the separation of gadolinium metal from gadolinia, in 1886.|$|E
5000|$|Erbium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Er and atomic number 68. A silvery-white solid metal when artificially isolated, natural erbium is always found in chemical {{combination with other}} elements.

50|$|Niven's {{first major}} {{contribution}} to mineralogy occurred in 1889 {{while he was}} on an expedition to Llano County, Texas, on behalf of Thomas Edison.
