5|$|Both of the mansion's {{two floors}} consist of four large rooms with high ceilings, {{and each of}} these rooms <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> size and shape. A grand {{stairway}} {{is located at the}} end of the mansion's central hall, extending from the first floor to the attic. The stairway's handrail is crafted of walnut, and it is connected to the stairway's shallow steps by a balustrade consisting of three small balusters per step.|$|E
5|$|Introduced as {{a direct}} {{challenge}} of corporate rival McDonald's, the Big King was Burger King's response to the Big Mac and had a similar style and taste. The sandwich was originally introduced in 1993 under the name Double Supreme during its testing stage. The name was switched to Big King when it was introduced nationally in 1997, and again to the King Supreme when reintroduced in 2002. The sandwich was discontinued in the North American market in the mid-2000s. In November 2013, Burger King brought the Big King back to the North American market as a permanent menu item. The Big King sandwich's recipe <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the original 1990s recipe, including a three-piece roll. The Big King sandwich is also sold {{in many of the}} company's international markets in several forms.|$|E

5|$|The {{graphics}} {{themselves were}} considered to be three-dimensional given the constraints of the technology at the time. All the players are Caucasian and each one's batting stance <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> The game view is always top down; when batting or pitching, it is centered above the catcher, behind the batter and with an overhead look of the pitcher. In the outfield, there is an aerial view of a portion of the field, with the team members represented by tiny sprites and an inset with red dots representing where the players are on base. Although the official colors are intact, the actual symbols on their uniforms are absent. The crowd is represented by a series of colored dots, while the dugouts are represented by plain white parallelograms.|$|E
5|$|Players who buy the Limited Collector's Edition get a {{polished}} Steelbook case, with the 2012 BMW M5 as the cover car. They receive a V.I.P. car pack, including the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport and Noble M600; a 10-car American Muscle Car Pack, including the Plymouth GTX 426 HEMI and Chevrolet Nova SS, (also available on Xbox Live on launch day); a pre-order exclusive Ship Bonus Car Pack, including the Koenigsegg Agera and Tesla Roadster Sport; a five-car BMW Designer Car Pack featuring five BMWs with unique exterior designs, including a BMW M6 designed by an entrant into an M6 design competition.

In addition to this, Collector's Edition owners are given a 96-page volume entitled 'Cars of Forza Motorsport 4 Presented By Top Gear, written by the editors from Top Gear magazine. This volume gives detailed information about many of the exotic cars found within the game, as well as photos (both in game and real life) of them.

25|$|Each NOR flash cell {{is larger}} than a NANDflash cell 10F2 vs 4F2 even when using exactly the same {{semiconductor}} device fabrication and so each transistor, contact, etc. <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> size because NORflash cells require a separate metal contact for each cell.|$|E
25|$|The alveoli {{are open}} (via the airways) to the atmosphere, {{with the result}} that {{alveolar}} air pressure <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the ambient air pressure at sea level, at altitude, or in any artificial atmosphere (e.g. a diving chamber, or decompression chamber) in which the individual is breathing freely. With expansion of the lungs (through lowering of the diaphragm and expansion of the thoracic cage) the alveolar air now occupies a larger volume, and its pressure falls proportionally, causing air to flow in from the surroundings, through the airways, till the pressure in the alveoli is once again at the ambient air pressure. The reverse obviously happens during exhalation. This process (of inhalation and exhalation) <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> at sea level, as on top of Mt. Everest, or in a diving chamber or decompression chamber.|$|E

25|$|Note {{that the}} {{resistor}} <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{in the time}} domain and the -domain. The sources are put in if there are initial conditions on the circuit elements. For example, if a capacitor has an initial voltage across it, or if the inductor has an initial current through it, the sources inserted in the -domain account for that.|$|E
25|$|Decryption <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as encryption, {{except that}} P1, P2, …, P18 {{are used in}} the reverse order. This is not so obvious because xor is {{commutative}} and associative. A common misconception is to use inverse order of encryption as decryption algorithm (i.e. first XORing P17 and P18 to the ciphertext block, then using the P-entries in reverse order).|$|E
25|$|This dialect {{has brought}} all {{borrowed}} words {{under its own}} laws of accidence; but its original vocabulary has been hopelessly impoverished and deprived of its finest elements. A Corfiote Jew visiting any part of Apulia would have found difficulty in understanding the spoken vernacular or the songs of the natives, although the grammatical structure <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as that of his own dialect.|$|E

25|$|In {{mathematics}} a fractal is {{an abstract}} object {{used to describe}} and simulate naturally occurring objects. Artificially created fractals commonly exhibit similar patterns at increasingly small scales. It {{is also known as}} expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry. If the replication <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> at every scale, it is called a self-similar pattern. An example of this is the Menger sponge. Fractals can also be nearly the same at different levels. This latter pattern is illustrated in small magnifications of the Mandelbrot set. Fractals also include the idea of a detailed pattern that repeats itself.|$|E
25|$|Some LCDs mimic needle tuners with {{a needle}} graphic that moves {{in the same way}} as a genuine needle tuner. Somewhat misleadingly, many LED {{displays}} have a 'strobe mode' that mimics strobe tuners by scrolling the flashing of the LEDs cyclically to simulate the display of a true strobe. However, these are all just display options. The way a regular tuner 'hears' and compares the input note to a desired pitch <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> with no change in accuracy. For more on how strobe tuners work see the dedicated section.|$|E
25|$|An unmoved pawn {{can move}} one step, {{up to the}} middle of the board (in the case of the 16×16 board, the eighth rank), or {{anything}} in between. Thus, 1.i8 is a legal opening move, and so are 1.i3, 1.i4, 1.i5, 1.i6, and 1.i7. Once it has moved for the first time, it can only make one step at a time. (In the case of an 8×8 board, this <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as in standard chess). Such a long initial pawn move allows the moving pawn to be captured en passant by an enemy pawn as if it had stopped on any one of the squares it had passed through.|$|E
