5|$|Edward Nicolls {{was born}} in 1779 in Coleraine, Ireland, the son of Jonathan Nicolls and Anna Cuppage. Jonathan Nicolls (died 1818) was for a time {{controller}} of excise for Coleraine. Anna Cuppage (1757?–1845) was a daughter of the Reverend Burke Cuppage, rector of Coleraine, a close kinsman and friend of <b>Edmund</b> <b>Burke.</b> Anna had an older brother William Cuppage (1756–1832), who had an appointment secured {{for him at the}} Royal Military Academy, Woolwich by <b>Edmund</b> <b>Burke.</b> William was later a lieutenant general of the Royal Artillery and a neighbour of Edward Nicolls in Woolwich.|$|E
5|$|<b>Edmund</b> <b>Burke</b> {{was elected}} as Whig Member of Parliament for Bristol in 1774 and campaigned for free trade, Catholic {{emancipation}} {{and the rights}} of the American colonists, but he angered his merchant sponsors with his detestation of the slave trade and lost the seat in 1780.|$|E
5|$|After having {{occupied}} {{their respective}} territories, the three partitioning powers demanded that King Stanisław August Poniatowski and the Sejm approve their action. The king {{appealed to the}} nations of Western Europe for help and tarried with the convocation of the Sejm. The European powers reacted to the partition with utmost indifference; only a few voices — like that of <b>Edmund</b> <b>Burke</b> — were raised in objection.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{prominent}} philosophers of the Enlightenment were John Locke, Thomas Paine, Samuel Johnson and Jeremy Bentham. More radical elements were later countered by <b>Edmund</b> <b>Burke</b> who is regarded as the founder of conservatism. The poet Alexander Pope with his satirical verse became well regarded. The English {{played a significant role in}} romanticism: Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, John Keats, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, William Blake and William Wordsworth were major figures.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, 1789, and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} {{it looked as if}} they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of revolution looming in Parliament, few were swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, {{one of the most effective}} and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley. In Parliament, William Pitt and <b>Edmund</b> <b>Burke</b> argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 he was {{appointed}} the marriage registrar at the sharia court in Haifa by the Waqf authorities in Jerusalem, a role {{that allowed him to}} tour the northern villages, whose inhabitants he encouraged to set up agricultural cooperatives. According to the American historian <b>Edmund</b> <b>Burke,</b> al-Qassam was:An individual deeply imbued with the Islamic social gospel and who was struck by the plight of Palestinian peasants and migrants. Al-Qassam's pastoral concern was linked to his moral outrage as a Muslim at {{the ways in which the}} old implicit social compact was being violated in the circumstances of British mandatory Palestine. This anger fueled a political radicalism that drove him eventually to take up arms and marks him off from the Palestinian notable politicians.|$|E

5|$|Several {{writers and}} {{politicians}} {{are associated with}} Fleet Street, either as residents or regulars to the various taverns, including Ben Jonson, John Milton, Izaak Walton, John Dryden, <b>Edmund</b> <b>Burke,</b> Oliver Goldsmith and Charles Lamb. The lexicographer Samuel Johnson lived at Gough Square off Fleet Street between 1748 and 1759; the building has survived into the 21st century. The cartographer John Senex owned a map store, The Sign of the Globe, on Fleet Street between 1725 and his death in 1736. Wynkyn de Worde was buried in St. Bride's Church in 1535, as was poet Richard Lovelace in 1657, while Samuel Pepys was baptised there in 1633.|$|E
5|$|Anne Crewe's great-grandson, John Crewe (1742–1829), {{was created}} the first Baron Crewe in 1806. A {{prominent}} Whig politician, he was a lifelong friend and supporter of Charles James Fox; his wife Frances Crewe (née Greville; 1748–1818) was a famous beauty and political hostess who gave lavish entertainments at the hall. The Crewes' social circle included many of the major figures of the day, and visitors to the hall during this period included politicians Fox and George Canning, philosopher <b>Edmund</b> <b>Burke,</b> playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan, poet William Spencer, musicologist Charles Burney, and artists Sir Joshua Reynolds and Sir Thomas Lawrence. John Crewe had the park landscaped and the hall extended, and also had the interior remodelled in the neo-Classical style then fashionable. Some forty years later, his grandson Hungerford Crewe (1812–94) went to considerable expense to have the interiors redecorated in a more sympathetic Jacobethan style.|$|E
5|$|In 1768, George Washington {{owned and}} raced a Narragansett Pacer, while in 1772, <b>Edmund</b> <b>Burke</b> asked an American friend for a pair. Paul Revere {{possibly}} rode a Pacer during his 1775 ride {{to warn the}} Americans of a British march. The extinction was due mainly to the breed being sold in such large numbers to sugarcane planters in the West Indies that breeding stock was severely diminished in the United States. The few horses that were left were crossbred to create and improve other breeds and the pure strain of the Narragansett soon became extinct. North Carolina was also a noted to have breeders of the Narragansett, with breeding stock having {{been brought to the}} area as early as 1790 by early pioneers. The last known Pacer, a mare, died around 1880.|$|E

5|$|The Analytical Review offered {{its readers}} {{access to a}} wide variety of works. In July 1789, when the Bastille fell, the Analytical {{reviewed}} The Rural Economy of Gloucestershire, Life of Thomas Chatterton, Transactions in Bengal, Military Operations on the Coromandel Coast, Poetry and Music of the Italian Opera, and Histoire Politique de la Revolution en France. The journal also laid provocative facts before the public to prompt them to think and, if necessary, to take action, although it claimed not to advocate one viewpoint over another. For example, when philosopher and statesman <b>Edmund</b> <b>Burke</b> issued his politically controversial Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), the Analytical Review reviewed it extensively, as well as the many responses to it, such as Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790), Vindiciae Gallicae (1791) by James Mackintosh, and Rights of Man (1791) by Thomas Paine. However, the majority of the excerpts that the reviewers chose to publish came from the rebuttals to Burke's work.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} a {{tradition}} of political activism. <b>Edmund</b> <b>Burke,</b> MP for the Bristol constituency for six years beginning in 1774, insisted that {{he was a member of}} parliament first and a representative of his constituents' interests second. Women's-rights advocate Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence (1867–1954) was born in Bristol, and left-wing politician Tony Benn was MP for Bristol South East in 1950–1960 and 1963–83. In 1963 the Bristol Bus Boycott, following the Bristol Omnibus Company's refusal to hire black drivers and conductors, drove the passage of the UK's 1965 Race Relations Act. The 1980 St. Pauls riot protested against racism and police harassment and showed mounting dissatisfaction with the social and economic circumstances of the city's Afro-Caribbean residents. Local support of fair trade was recognised in 2005, when Bristol became a Fairtrade zone.|$|E
5|$|In England {{he met the}} King {{on several}} {{occasions}} and dined {{with a number of}} influential British politicians, including William Pitt, Charles James Fox and <b>Edmund</b> <b>Burke.</b> Metternich was nominated the new Minister Plenipotentiary to the Austrian Netherlands and left England in September 1794. Unfortunately, he found an exiled and powerless government in headlong retreat from the latest French advance. In October a revitalised French army swept into Germany and annexed all of the Metternich estates except Königswart. Disappointed, and affected by strong criticism of his father's policies, he joined his parents in Vienna in November. On 27 September 1795 he married Countess Eleonore von Kaunitz, a granddaughter of former Austrian chancellor Wenzel Kaunitz. The marriage was arranged by Metternich's mother and introduced him to Viennese society. This was undoubtedly part of the motivation for Metternich, who demonstrated less affection for her than she for him. Two conditions were imposed by the father of the bride, Prince Kaunitz: first, the still youthful Eleonore was to continue to live at home; and second, Metternich was forbidden from serving as a diplomat as long as the Prince was still alive. Their daughter Maria was born in January 1797.|$|E
50|$|Dodsley {{carried on}} an {{extensive}} business, but had other interests; writing from Woodstock on 26 July 1789 Thomas King refers to his farming and haymaking. Eighteen thousand copies of <b>Edmund</b> <b>Burke's</b> Reflections on the Revolution in France were sold by him in 1790.|$|R
50|$|Rights of Man (1791), {{a book by}} Thomas Paine, {{including}} 31 articles, {{posits that}} popular political revolution is permissible when a government does not safeguard the natural rights of its people. Using these points as a base it defends the French Revolution against <b>Edmund</b> <b>Burke's</b> attack in Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790).|$|R
5000|$|Catharine Macaulay (1731-1791) was an English {{historian}} and writer. She attacked <b>Edmund</b> <b>Burke's</b> Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents, calling it [...] "a poison...". In her 1790 Letters on Education, she argued {{along the lines}} that Mary Wollstonecraft would do in 1792, that the apparent weakness of women was due to their mis-education.|$|R
5|$|The revolt {{formed the}} basis for the late 16th-century play, The Life and Death of Jack Straw, {{possibly}} written by George Peele and probably originally designed for production in the city's guild pageants. It portrays Jack Straw as a tragic figure, being led into wrongful rebellion by John Ball, making clear political links between the instability of late-Elizabethan England and the 14th century. The story of the revolt was used in pamphlets during the English Civil War of the 17th century, and formed part of John Cleveland's early history of the war. It was deployed as a cautionary account in political speeches during the 18th century, and a chapbook entitled The History of Wat Tyler and Jack Strawe proved popular during the Jacobite risings and American War of Independence. Thomas Paine and <b>Edmund</b> <b>Burke</b> argued over the lessons to be drawn from the revolt, Paine expressing sympathy for the rebels and Burke condemning the violence. The Romantic poet Robert Southey based his 1794 play Wat Tyler on the events, taking a radical and pro-rebel perspective.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Paine was a noted {{writer and}} {{political}} theorist whose work had influenced and helped drive the American Revolution. Having returned to England, {{he decided to}} write a book addressing the arguments of <b>Edmund</b> <b>Burke,</b> a prominent conservative strongly fearful of the French Revolution. This was simply titled Rights of Man. The first part was published in 1791, and attracted no attention from Pitt's administration. The second, published on 16 February 1792, advocated, amongst other things, {{the right of the people}} to replace their government if they thought it appropriate. The work was an immediate success, selling a million and a half copies, and generated public support for various reform movements. It also brought Paine to the attention of the government and made him a subject to its crackdown. While Paine was visiting an aunt in Kent, Pitt had a writ issued against J.S. Jordan, Paine's publisher, prosecuting him for seditious libel—a crime based on the concept that the executive was beyond reproach, that made it illegal to criticise the government. Paine returned to London and began to campaign for Jordan, finding him a lawyer and agreeing to pay his legal fees. Jordan, however, most likely frightened for his life, pleaded guilty and turned his files over to the court. With this additional evidence, a writ was issued for Paine on 21 May, charging him with the same crime. His trial date was set for 8 June, and later rescheduled for 18 December.|$|E
