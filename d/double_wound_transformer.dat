With no arc current, the transformer and capacitor resonate at line frequency and generate about twice the supply voltage across the tube, and a small electrode heating current. This tube voltage is too low to strike the arc with cold electrodes, but as the electrodes heat up to thermionic emission temperature, the tube striking voltage falls below that of the ringing voltage, and the arc strikes. As the electrodes heat, the lamp slowly, over three to five seconds, reaches full brightness. As the arc current increases and tube voltage drops, the circuit provides current limiting.|$|E

40|$|The present thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} numerical techniques and methods for the evaluation and minimization of <b>wound</b> core distribution <b>transformer</b> no load losses. The aforementioned numerical techniques are combined with deterministic and stochastic optimization algorithms for the minimization of the manufacturing and the total owing cost of <b>wound</b> core <b>transformers.</b> The no load loss evaluation is achieved by {{the application of a}} new technique that combines the computed peak flux density distribution with the experimentally determined local specific core losses. The computation of the peak flux density distribution is performed by a novel iterative procedure and nonlinear finite element magnetostatic analysis, avoiding in this manner the computationally expensive harmonic and transient analysis. The representation of the wound core material anisotropy is accomplished by a new elliptic anisotropy model specifically developed for wound cores, in contrast with conventional elliptic anisotropy models that have been developed so far which are suitable for stack core transformers. The advantages of the aforementioned technique, in contrast with conventional techniques appearing in the literature, are its accuracy and low computational cost which renders the proposed numerical technique ideal for industry application. Furthermore, a novel technique for the no load loss minimization has been developed. The specific technique is based on the wound core flux density non-uniformity and makes use of multiple grade lamination wound cores which are constructed of two different grades of grain oriented magnetic steel. By applying the multiple grade lamination wound core technique a further reduction of the total owing cost of <b>wound</b> core distribution <b>transformers</b> is achieved.
