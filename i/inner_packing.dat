Histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques confirmed {{the presence of}} elastic domains but the absence of collagen, which {{is known to be}} the main component in other molluscs. Ultrastructural analysis by TEM revealed the presence of at least two components within the thread, and an inner arrangement of straight, tightly packed longitudinal streaks.

40|$|Abstract. With the {{development}} of a humanized market, packaging of tea is not only to improve product value, but also to provide more chances for tea lovers to {{have a better understanding of}} tea and the origin of tea. The colors, patterns and fonts of the gift package is an indispensable design item which convey information of products to consumers. In recent years, the tea packaging has broken through the shackles of traditional norms, and is moving forwards to a variety of fashionable styles. The thesis has observed that packaging design is deeply influenced by the change of trend in tea market. Tea packaging is an important means of maintaining the quality of tea. Meanwhile, it can also add the value of goods. The ultimate purpose of using colors, patterns and fonts is to show characteristics of tea through each type of packaging. Packaging Design Packaging of goods refers to containers and wrappage which are used to hold and pack goods. It can be divided into three types: <b>inner</b> <b>packing,</b> neutral packing and outer packing(Michael and Elnora, 1997). With {{the development}} of market economy, the packaging of goods has become increasingly important.

40|$|The {{microwave}} radiative and backscatter {{characteristics of}} sea ice in an Arctic marginal ice zone {{have been studied}} using near-simultaneous passive and active synthetic aperture radar microwave data. Intermediate-resolution multichannel passive microwave data were registered and analyzed. Passive and active microwave data generally complement each other as the two sensors are especially sensitive to different physical properties of the sea ice. In the <b>inner</b> <b>pack,</b> undeformed first-year ice is observed to have low backscatter values but high brightness temperatures while multiyear ice has generally high backscatter values and low brightness temperatures. However, in the marginal ice zone, the signature and backscatter for multiyear ice are considerably different and closer to those of first-year ice.

40|$|The {{growth of}} the Weddell Sea ice cover in 1980 is examined, using Nimbus- 7 {{satellite}} Scanning Multi-channel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) data in combination with data (positional, air temperature and atmospheric pressure) from 4 Nimbus-tracked drifting buoys. Ice concentrations are retrieved from the SMMR data by applying a cluster analysis algorithm developed by J. Comiso of NASA. Analyses of computed differential kinematic parameters (DKP) s of the buoy array offer insight into the complex mesoscale behaviour of the underlying Weddell Gyre. High frequency divergence, convergence and deformation events isolated in the DKP results, and driven largely by the regular passage of cyclones, are related to changes in ice concentration observed in the SMMR data. The profound role of the Antarctic Peninsula in influencing both atmospheric and oceanic circulation (and thus ice formation, drift and eventual decay) {{in the region is}} evaluated. Possible relationships between buoy drift in the <b>inner</b> <b>pack</b> and ice edge advance are examined, yielding information on the relative importance of ice growth in open water within the pack and that at the ice edge. After an introductory chapter, Chapter 2 describes the physical setting of the Weddell Sea. Comparisons are drawn both with other sectors of the Southern Ocean and the Arctic, emphasizing the uniqueness of the region {{not only in terms of}} its climate and oceanography but also its sea ice cover. Chapter 3 traces the evolution of passive microwave remote sensing from space as a tool for monitoring Antarctic sea ice extent and concentration; the relative merits and disadvantages of these techniques are evaluated. Chapter 4 concentrates on the use of SMMR data. Detailed comparisons are made of algorithms available for the extraction of ice concentrations from the raw brightness temperature data. The choice of algorithm used is justified. Chapter 5 is largely concerned with the analysis of the buoy data, and the kinematic behaviour of the array as a unit. These results are combined with the SMMR data in Chapter 6 to identify distinct dynamic zones and meridional advective sectors, and to compare the behaviour of the <b>inner</b> <b>pack</b> with that of the unconstrained ice edge. The evolution of a high concentration core within the unique perennial sea ice zone hugging the east coast of the Peninsula, which persists throughout the period of study is unusual enough to merit a separate sub-section.

40|$|In recent decades, Antarctic sea ice has {{expanded}} slightly while Arctic sea ice has contracted dramatically. The anthropogenic contribution to these changes cannot be fully assessed unless climate models {{are able to}} reproduce them. Process-based evaluation is needed to provide {{a clear view of}} the capabilities and limitations of such models. In this study, ice concentration and drift derived from AMSR-E data during 2003 â€“ 10 are combined to derive a climatology of the ice concentration budget at both poles. This enables an observational decomposition of the seasonal dynamic and thermodynamic changes in ice cover. In both hemispheres, the results show spring ice loss dominated by ice melting. In other seasons ice divergence maintains freezing in the <b>inner</b> <b>pack</b> while advection causes melting at the ice edge, as ice is transported beyond the region where it is thermodynamically sustainable. Mechanical redistribution provides an important sink of ice concentration in the central Arctic and around the Antarctic coastline. This insight builds upon existing understanding of the sea ice cycle gained from ice and climate models, and the datasets may provide a valuable tool in validating such models in the future...|$|R

40|$|Background, aim, {{and scope}} Packaging uses nearly 40 % of all polymers, a {{substantial}} share {{of which is}} used for sensitive merchandise such as moisture-sensitive food. To find out if bio-based materials are environmentally advantageous for this demanding application, we compared laminated, printed film across the whole life cycle. Materials and methods We compared bio-based materials (paper, polylactic acid, bio-based polyethylene, and a bio-based polyester) as well as conventional ones (polypropylene, polyethylene). Data stemmed from 13 companies that produce raw materials, films and/or laminates and which co-operated with us in a project commissioned by a large food producer. The functional unit chosen for this study is 1 m 2 of packaging film. This is (mostly) laminated, printed film that is delivered on reels to the food industry, where the laminate is cut, sealed and filled. The impact assessment is presented for non-renewable energy use, total energy use, global warming potential, depletion of abiotic resources, photo-oxidant formation, acidification, eutrophication, water use, and land use. Results For <b>Inner</b> <b>Packs</b> that get {{in direct contact with}} food and therefore require certain barrier properties, the environmental performance of many laminates is not better than the reference, petrochemical material. However, our study shows that paper/polypropylene laminates perform equally well as the current material (polypropylene) if the material is landfilled, and better if incinerated with energy recovery. For Outer Packs, bio-based polyethylene film shows a particularly low environmental impact. Paper/bio-based polyester laminates also offer significant savings compared with the current material. For Inner as well as Outer Packs, laminates including polylactic acid offer environmental advantages when accounting for wind credits or when assuming a future technology level for polymer or film production. Discussion Increased technology maturity of PLA and cellulose in the film production stage offers significant environmental improvement with respect to global warming potential compared with todayâ€™s technology. Though large, the uncertainty regarding the degree of degradation of paper, cellulose, PLA and bio-based polyester, is not decisive for the conclusions. Conclusions and recommendations Generally, laminates and films (partly) consisting of bio-based polymers offer opportunities for significantly reducing environmental impacts of food packaging. Large variations in land-use are possible {{depending on the type of}} bio-based material that is used. The environmental advantages differ depending on the polymer and the final product (<b>Inner</b> vs. Outer <b>Pack).</b> Lack of experience and investment in converting bio-based polymers into final products and comparatively unfavourable material properties result in lower environmental advantages for some novel bio-based materials than one may expect. However, a) already today, the options with the lowest global warming potential are partly or fully bio-based and b) bio-based materials will benefit more from technological progress than conventional materials, potentially making certain bio-based laminates highly attractive options for the future. Overall, Outer Packs are more promising than <b>Inner</b> <b>Packs</b> when introducing bio-based wrappings to replace the current petrochemical material because a) the opportunities are clearer for this application and b) the product specifications (required barrier properties) are less demanding. Starting with the Outer Packs would also allow bio-based polymer producers and processors to invest and learn, thus offering the opportunity to reduce the environmental impact even further...|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{the rapid}} sea ice losses {{reported}} in the Arctic, satellite observations show an overall increase in Antarctic sea ice concentration over recent decades. However, observations of decadal trends in Antarctic ice thickness, and hence ice volume, do not currently exist. In this study {{a model of the}} Southern Ocean and its sea ice, forced by atmospheric reanalyses, is used to assess 1992 â€“ 2010 trends in ice thickness and volume. The model successfully reproduces observations of mean ice concentration, thickness, and drift, and decadal trends in ice concentration and drift, imparting some confidence in the hindcasted trends in ice thickness. The model suggests that overall Antarctic sea ice volume has increased by approximately 30 km 3 yrâˆ’ 1 (0. 4 % yrâˆ’ 1) as an equal result of areal expansion (20 Ã— 103 km 2 yrâˆ’ 1 or 0. 2 % yrâˆ’ 1) and thickening (1. 5 mm yrâˆ’ 1 or 0. 2 % yrâˆ’ 1). This ice volume increase is an order of magnitude smaller than the Arctic decrease, and about half the size of the increased freshwater supply from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Similarly to the observed ice concentration trends, the small overall increase in modeled ice volume is actually the residual of much larger opposing regional trends. Thickness changes near the ice edge follow observed concentration changes, with increasing concentration corresponding to increased thickness. Ice thickness increases are also found in the <b>inner</b> <b>pack</b> in the Amundsen and Weddell Seas, where the model suggests that observed ice-drift trends directed toward the coast have caused dynamical thickening in autumn and winter. Modeled changes are predominantly dynamic in origin in the Pacific sector and thermodynamic elsewhere...|$|R

Furthermore, by dividing vectors into blocks of length n, we can pack vectors of length m into âŒˆm/nâŒ‰ ciphertexts and compute the <b>inner</b> product over <b>packed</b> ciphertexts. In the case of n= 2048 and m= 10, 000, we need âŒˆm/nâŒ‰= 5 packed ciphertexts and it also takes about 5 Ã— 5.31 = 26.55 ms for a secure inner product between two binary vectors of length m= 10, 000. These performances are practical in real life, and hence we hope that the SHE scheme with our packing method would be used in various applications mainly including marketing analysis. However, our packing method can be used between only two parties, and hence our future work is to develop a new method which {{can be applied to the}} set intersection computation among more than three parties.|$|R

In addition, frequent cases of stable chaos are found in the proximity of the Hill limit.

Steady-state heat transfer experiments were carried out in a tube of 28 mm <b>inner</b> diameter <b>packed</b> with different open-cell foams using N 2 or He at a flow rate ranging from 15 to 35 Nl/min. The foam samples were made of either FeCrAlY or aluminum with porosities in the range of 89 â€“ 95 % and pore densities ranging from 10 to 40 PPI (nominal pores per linear inch). For this purpose, axial and radial temperature profiles along the tested foam samples and along the tube wall were collected in heating and cooling runs within a temperature range from 400 to 800 K. The effective radial and axial conductivity and the wall heat transfer coefficient were then estimated for each run by nonlinear regression, using a 2 D pseudo-homogeneous heat transfer model. The collected data allowed deriving a correlation for the wall heat transfer coefficient as a function of the process conditions and of the foam structural properties. Complementary to these experimental investigations, a numerical study in a 3 D geometry of a foam sample reconstructed from X-ray micro-computed tomography data was carried out in order to analyze the heat transfer process close to the wall. For this, the conjugated heat transfer in both the solid and the fluid phase was investigated by finite volume analysis for selected experimental conditions.

40|$|With {{thousands}} of exoplanets having been discovered {{over the past}} 20 years, the solar system is recognized as presenting just one example among a mind-boggling variety of system architectures: from circumbinary exoplanets (1), systems with tightly <b>packed</b> <b>inner</b> planets (2), water-worlds (3), potential Earth twins (4), super-Earths (5), sub- and super-Neptunes (6), evaporating comet-like planets (7), giant rings (8), and hazy hot Jupiters {{all the way to}} extremely long-period lonely massive objects looking more like failed stars than giant planets. So far, the vast majority of these planetary systems have been discovered indirectly by techniques looking at tiny variations in their host star's motion and/or brightness. These techniques have limited remote-sensing capabilities, yet have ushered in an entirely new branch of astrophysics called comparative exoplanetology, putting the solar system and its planets into a universal perspective. On page 64 of this issue, Macintosh et al. (9) present the discovery of a young giant exoplanet with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) and a technique called high-contrast imaging. Beyond taking striking pictures (see the figure), the technique promises to yield the most detailed measurements of whole distant planetary systems, including spectroscopy of planet atmospheres and time-resolved astrometry of their orbital motion...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Our {{primary goal}} is to {{investigate}} the effects of non-Newtonian blood properties on wall shear stress in microvessels. The secondary goal is to derive a correction factor for the Poiseuille-law-based indirect measurements of wall shear stress. Methods: The flow is assumed to exhibit two distinct, immiscible and homogeneous fluid layers: an <b>inner</b> region densely <b>packed</b> with RBCs, and an outer cell-free layer whose thickness depends on discharge hematocrit. The cell-free layer {{is assumed to be}} New-tonian, while rheology of the RBC-rich core is modeled using the Quemada constitutive law. Results: Our model provides a realistic description of experimen-tally observed blood velocity profiles, tube hematocrit, core hematocrit, and apparent viscosity over a wide range of vessel radii and discharge hematocrits. Conclusions: Our analysis reveals the importance of incorporat-ing this complex blood rheology into estimates of WSS in microvessels. The latter is accomplished by specifying a correction factor, which accounts for the deviation of blood flow from the Poiseuille law. KEY WORDS: blood rheology, hematocrit, shear thinning, plasma layer, apparent viscosity, shear stress Abbreviations used: CFL, cell-free layer; MRI, magnetic reso-nance imaging; NO, nitric oxide; PIV, particle image velocimetry; RBC, red blood cell; RMSE, root mean square error; WSS, wall shear stress...|$|R
40|$|Aims. Our {{new program}} with HARPS aims to detect mean motion {{resonant}} planetary systems around stars which were previously {{reported to have}} a single bona fide planet, often based only on sparse radial velocity data. Methods. Archival and new HARPS radial velocities for the K 2 V star HD 27894 were combined and fitted with a three-planet self-consistent dynamical model. The best-fit orbit was tested for long-term stability. Results. We find clear evidence that HD 27894 is hosting at least three massive planets. In addition to the already known Jovian planet with a period P_ b â‰ˆ 18 days we discover a Saturn-mass planet with P_ c â‰ˆ 36 days, likely in a 2 : 1 mean motion resonance with the first planet, and a cold massive planet (â‰ˆ 5. 3 M_Jup) with a period P_ d â‰ˆ 5170 days on a moderately eccentric orbit (e_ d = 0. 39). Conclusions. HD 27894 is hosting a massive, eccentric giant planet orbiting around a tightly <b>packed</b> <b>inner</b> pair of massive planets likely involved in an asymmetric 2 : 1 mean motion resonance. HD 27894 {{may be an important}} milestone for probing planetary formation and evolution scenarios. Comment: 4 pages, 2 tables, 3 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A Letters to the Edito...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} the rhodolith-bearing {{deposits in}} {{the largest and most}} rhodolith-rich outcrop of the Polish Outer Carpathian flysch, located in the Silesian Nappe, at the village of Melsztyn. The rhodoliths and sparse associated biota occur as resedimented components in a deep-marine succession of siliciclastic conglomerates and coarse-grained sandstones, deposited by high-density turbidity currents and debris flows. The sediment was derived from a fan-delta system located at the southern margin of the Silesian flysch basin. Stratigraphic data indicate that the succession represents the Upper Istebna Sandstone deposited during the Late Paleocene. The rhodoliths are composed mostly of coralline red algae with seven genera and eight species representing the family Sporolithaceae and the subfamilies Mastophoroideae and Melobesioideae. Rhodoliths show subspheroidal and sub-ellipsoidal shapes with encrusting, warty and lumpy growth forms. Lumpy growth forms show massive inner arrangements, whereas the encrusting growth forms are usually made of thin thalli and show more loosely <b>packed</b> <b>inner</b> arrangements. The rhodoliths grew on a moderately mobile siliciclastic substrate in a shallow-marine environment with a low net sedimentation rate. It is inferred that the growth of rhodoliths was favored during a relative sea-level rise. During the subsequent sea-level fall, the rhodoliths and associated siliciclastic deposits were resedimented by gravity flows into the deep-sea setting. The analyzed deposits, like other Paleoceneâ€“Eocene deposits of the Polish Outer Carpathians, provide no evidence of coeval widespread shallow-marine carbonate sedimentation along the margins of the Outer Carpathian flysch basins...|$|R
40|$|Rice flours with {{different}} particle sizes and degrees of damaged starch granules were produced by hammer milling and cryogenic milling of rice grains, where degradation of starch molecules {{was evident in}} the hammer-milled flours, but not in the cryogenically milled flours. The solubility and swelling properties of the resulting rice flours were determined in cold (30 Â°C) and hot water (90 Â°C). The cold- and hot-water starch solubility was strongly correlated with the degree of damaged starch granules, and weakly with the particle size of rice flour. No evident correlations were observed between starch solubility and the molecular structures, indicating that molecular degradation by milling process was not the only precondition of increased starch solubility. Possible mechanism for the observed correlations is that increasing surface area and/or exposure of loosely <b>packed</b> <b>inner</b> part of starch granules with increasing degree of damaged starch granules allowed more starch molecules to leach out in cold and hot water. Furthermore, the cold-water swelling of rice flour was strongly correlated with the degree of damaged starch granules, possibly due to the rapid hydration of damaged starch granules, whereas the hot-water swelling did not show any correlations with flour particle size and granular and molecular starch structures. The results have provided better insights in the relationship between starch structures and solubility and swelling properties of rice flour, which can be used to improve the manufacture and selection criteria of rice flour for better products...|$|R
40|$|Certain {{features}} of the fine structure of a marine achromobacter and a marine pseudomonad were dependent upon the conditions of growth. Cells of achromobacter grown at 10 C in a low peptone-seawater (SW) medium displayed the characteristic morphology of the achromobacter: a regularly undulant outer element of the cell wall and a planar <b>inner</b> element, tightly <b>packed</b> ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles in the cytoplasm, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) disposed in a lobate manner, and dense inclusion bodies. Few mesosomes, however, were seen. Cells of achromobacter grown at 10 C in a high peptone-SW medium had larger and more highly organized mesosomes. At 22 C, in a low peptone-SW medium, no mesosomes were seen, but the inclusions were more frequently seen and were larger in the achromobacter cells. At 22 C, in a high peptone-SW medium, these cells revealed the greatest variation in cellular morphology. They contained both small and large mesosomes, or no mesosomes, and both small and large inclusions, or no inclusions. Pseudomonad cells at 10 C in a low peptone-SW medium revealed a typical gram-negative morphology: double-layered, irregularly undulant cell wall; more nearly planar cytoplasmic membrane; densely stained, lightly packed RNP particles; finely fibrillar, axially disposed DNA; simple mesosomes. At 10 C, in a high peptone-SW medium, pseudomonad cells revealed associated strands of material and intracytoplasmic ringlike structures. At 22 C, in a low peptone-SW medium, pseudomonad cells had a more undulant cell-wall and a more nearly planar cytoplasmic membrane. At 22 C, in a high peptone-SW medium, these cells revealed prominent blebs of the cell wall...|$|R
