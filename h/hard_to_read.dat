25|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was probably}} copied in western France, perhaps at Fleury Abbey. The riddle was added {{after the completion}} of the main contents, fairly certainly at Fleury Abbey, in the tenth century, but the language of the text is older, of the eighth century. It was already <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> by the earlier nineteenth century, and was further damaged by the librarian, Willem George Pluygers, who in 1864 applied reagents to the text in an attempt to make it more legible.|$|E

25|$|It is {{produced}} in both hardcover and softcover versions. Since 2006, a larger format edition has been published on an experimental basis. This {{is said to be}} in response to requests from readers who find the print size of the standard edition <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> It is around twice the traditional size and was published in a limited edition of 5,000. It is not a large print book as such, as the print will still be of a size found in many standard books.|$|E
25|$|Appeal in {{a cartoon}} {{character}} corresponds {{to what would}} be called charisma in an actor. A character who is appealing is not necessarily sympathetic – villains or monsters can also be appealing – {{the important thing is}} that the viewer feels the character is real and interesting. There are several tricks for making a character connect better with the audience; for likable characters a symmetrical or particularly baby-like face tends to be effective. A complicated or <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> face will lack appeal, it may more accurately be described as 'captivation' in the composition of the pose, or the character design.|$|E
25|$|In Visual Studio 2012 RC, a {{major change}} to the {{interface}} {{is the use of}} all-caps menu bar, as part of the campaign to keep Visual Studio consistent with the direction of other Microsoft user interfaces, and to provide added structure to the top menu bar area. The redesign was criticized for being <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> and going against the trends started by developers to use CamelCase to make words stand out better. Some speculated that the root cause of the redesign was to incorporate the simplistic look and feel of Metro apps. However, there exists a Windows Registry option to allow users to disable the all-caps interface.|$|E
5000|$|On {{official}} forms, one {{is often}} asked to [...] "please print". This is because cursive handwriting is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> and the glyphs are joined {{so they do}} not fit neatly into separate boxes.|$|R
50|$|A {{more complex}} style is wildstyle, {{a form of}} {{graffiti}} usually involving interlocking letters and connecting points. These pieces are often <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> by non-graffiti artists as the letters merge into one another in an often-undecipherable manner.|$|R
5000|$|This however {{makes the}} {{procedure}} more complicated by mixing boundary checks with normal logic, {{and it becomes}} <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> Using the null object pattern, one can create a special version of the procedure but only for null nodes: ...|$|R
25|$|In the {{original}} paper, the algorithm is presented more formally using a substitution style instead {{of side effects}} in the method above. In the latter form, the side effect invisibly takes care of all places where a type variable is used. Explicitly using substitutions not only makes the algorithm <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> because the side effect occurs virtually everywhere, but also gives the false impression that the method might be costly. When implemented using purely functional means or {{for the purpose of}} proving the algorithm to be basically equivalent to the deduction system, full explicitness is of course needed and {{the original}} formulation a necessary refinement.|$|E
25|$|Vanir {{was one of}} the Devil King's generals who ends {{up taking}} over the {{management}} of Wiz's magic shop. He is the devil of foresight and one of the dukes of hell, with the ability to read everything about anybody, but he cannot read anything about people that are as powerful as he is (the Devil King's generals and other dukes), people stronger than him (Aqua and other gods), and people who are a little weaker than him; these people have their readings clouded and incomplete. An exception to this is Kazuma, whose cunning nature makes him <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> He also has very powerful combat skills that he refuses to use on humans.|$|E
25|$|Old Dutch {{naturally}} {{evolved into}} Middle Dutch. The year 1150 {{is often cited}} {{as the time of}} the discontinuity, but it actually marks a time of profuse Dutch writing and during this period a rich Medieval Dutch literature developed. There was at that time no overarching standard language; Middle Dutch is rather a collective name for a number of closely related mutually intelligible dialects whose ancestor was Old Dutch. Where Old Dutch fragments are very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> for untrained Modern Dutch speakers, the various literary works of Middle Dutch are somewhat more accessible. The most notable difference between Old and Middle Dutch is in a feature of speech known as vowel reduction. Round vowels in word-final syllables are rather frequent in Old Dutch; in Middle Dutch, such vowels are leveled to a schwa.|$|E
50|$|The relative-addressing {{aspects of}} the mill's machine code and {{assembly}} language may be <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and debug than the more conventional register name paradigm, but few large projects are written in such low-level programming languages. Eliminating registers avoids complex register renaming schemes.|$|R

500|$|Several reviewers {{criticized the}} artwork in Phantom Blood for the characters' anatomy and posing; Silverman {{described}} it as featuring impossible poses and characters appearing to have disproportionally small heads atop large, muscled bodies. She additionally criticized the art for being crowded and <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> ComicsAlliance disliked how the art felt derivative of Fist of the North Star. Takato at Manga-News thought that the anatomy and posing, while fitting {{the tone of the}} story, were unlikely and badly drawn. Luster thought that the art was not nearly as good as Araki's later works, but that it was charming and worked despite the [...] "twisted proportions" [...] due to its high intensity and stylization. Kory Cerjak at The Fandom Post enjoyed the artwork, however, calling it [...] "straight out of the 80s", giving the series a similar feeling to watching a good action film from the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|During season two, Perrineau stated [...] "'s nicer than I {{expected}} him to be. Or, he is nicer so far than I {{expected him}} to be ... I try to take characters that I think are challenging and a little complicated and hopefully really smart and thoughtful and compassionate. I think Michael is all those things. He seems {{to have a lot of}} bad luck." [...] He defends Michael's behavior in season two, saying [...] " [...] keeps stepping into more trouble than he actually asked for". Cynthia Littleton of Variety described Michael as [...] "one of the most interesting of the Oceanic 815-ers: flawed, tortured, <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> volatile, fighting his innate talents, his own worst enemy, at times, and at others, a totally stand-up guy." [...] IGN's Chris Carabott calls Michael a [...] "natural" [...] father. Michael is known for frequently shouting [...] "Walt!", [...] "Where's my son!" [...] and [...] "Have you seen my boy?".|$|E
5000|$|Robert Cecil Martin (against System Hungarian {{notation}} and {{all other}} forms of encoding): ... nowadays HN {{and other forms of}} type encoding are simply impediments. They make it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> change the name or type of a variable, function, member or class. They make it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the code. And they create the possibility that the encoding system will mislead the reader.|$|R
50|$|Every {{reference}} to a value set would then {{need to be changed}} to take account of the extra level of structure in the value set, which would make the description <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> For the sake of readability this extra level of structure has been omitted from the definition of value sets.|$|R
50|$|Another {{reason to}} use rich black for small areas of black {{is to avoid}} {{trapping}} issues. Rich black is often used for text printed over a picture or colored background, because otherwise any slight mis-registration between printing plates would produce a white or colored halo around the text, making it much <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b>|$|R
500|$|Although {{he wrote}} his second set of hymns, Hymns [...] for the Amusement of Children, for a younger audience, Smart cares more about {{emphasizing}} the need for children to be moral instead of [...] "innocent". These works {{have been seen as}} possibly too complicated for [...] "amusement" [...] because they employ ambiguities and complicated theological concepts. In particular, Mark Booth questions [...] "why, in this carefully polished writing.... are the lines sometimes relatively <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> for their paraphrasable sense?" [...] Arthur Sherbo disagreed with this sentiment strongly and claims the Hymns [...] "are more than mere hack work, tossed off with speed and indifference. They were written when Smart was in prison and despairing of rescue. Into these poems, some of them of a bare simplicity and naiveté that have few equals in literature of merit anywhere..." [...] However, he does admit some of the argument when he claims that [...] "Generosity", along with a handful other hymns, was [...] "not so simple and surely proved too much for the children for whom they were bought." ...|$|E
500|$|The Petworth House globe, {{now in the}} North Gallery, is {{the only}} Molyneux {{terrestrial}} globe preserved in its original 1592 state. One of Molyneux's [...] "great globes", measuring [...] in diameter, it was reported in 1952 to be in poor condition despite restoration by the British Museum the previous year. The northern hemisphere was darkened by dirt and badly rubbed in places, {{to the extent that}} it was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> Parts of it, and large sections of the southern hemisphere, are missing altogether. The restoration work revealed that the globe is weighted with sand and made from layers of small pieces of paper overlaid with a coat of plaster about 1⁄8 inch (3mm) thick. On top of this is another layer of paper over which the gores are pasted. The globe retains its wooden horizon circle and brass meridian ring, but its hour circle and index are missing. Further restoration took place between 1995 and 1997. The globe was exhibited at the Royal Geographical Society in 1951 and 1952.|$|E
500|$|In July 2007, German art {{historian}} Ulrich Merkl self-published a , 464-page volume called Dream of the Rarebit Fiend, reproducing 369 {{of the strip}}s in full size. [...] Previous reprintings of the strip reduced the strips to {{about a third of}} their originally published size, resulting in loss of detail and making the lettering <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> [...] The size of the book made automatic binding impossible, so it had to be bound by hand. [...] The book was limited to 1000 copies, and a DVD was included with scans of the 821 known installments of the strip, the complete text of the book, a catalogue raisonné of the strips, and a video of an example of McCay's animation. [...] The sources of the strips were from Merkl's personal collection, the Cartoon Research Library of the Ohio State University, and microfilms purchased from the New York Public Library containing the complete New York Evening Journal run of the strip. [...] Merkl has said that, on average, six hours were required per strip for scanning and restoration. [...] The book also featured two essays by Italian comics editor Alfredo Castelli and one by Jeremey Taylor, former president of the International Association for the Study of Dreams.|$|E
50|$|Self-modifying code is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and {{maintain}} because {{the instructions in}} the source program listing {{are not necessarily the}} instructions that will be executed. Self-modification that consists of substitution of function pointers might not be as cryptic, if {{it is clear that the}} names of functions to be called are placeholders for functions to be identified later.|$|R
5000|$|Writing {{in plain}} {{language}} also {{takes into account}} the presentation of the text. It is important to choose a font that is easy <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> and set it to an adequate size. [...] Sentences written in capital letters are <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> because the letters are less distinguishable from one another. [...] Simple design elements like leaving white spaces, using bullets, and choosing contrasting colours encourages a user <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the text and makes it easier <b>to</b> <b>read.</b>|$|R
50|$|SMILES {{does not}} require that ring numbers be used in any {{particular}} order, and permits ring number zero, although this is rarely used. Also, it is permitted to re-use ring numbers after the first ring has closed, although this usually makes formulae <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, {{but it may also}} be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relation between}} annual report readability and firm performance and earnings persistence. I measure the readability of public company annual reports using the Fog index from the computational linguistics literature {{and the length of}} the document.

Primarily, it is an order of magnitude <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> use and understand. It also necessitates the user to learn a whole new alphabet. Finally, 85 is not a “bit-boundary” number, base 85 therefore does not fully utilize all of the required 7 bits and as a result will produce over-length and discontiguous binary strings.|$|R
