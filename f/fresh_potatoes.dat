40|$|There {{is growing}} {{concern about the}} {{sustainability}} of food production and marketing systems when measured against a set of sometimes conflicting economic, environmental and social criteria. In this context, this research aims to develop and apply a framework to assess the sustainability of fresh produce supply chains, from farm to retail outlet, using British <b>fresh</b> <b>potato</b> production and marketing as a case study. Following a review of relevant literature, in-depth interviews were carried out with farmers, merchants and retailers to explore perceptions of the sustainability of the <b>fresh</b> <b>potato</b> supply chain over the last decade. After this, the research adopted quantitative and qualitative methods of investigation. An {{attempt was made to}} measure the changes in the performance of the <b>fresh</b> <b>potato</b> supply chain between 1990 and 2000 in an objective manner, using thirteen sustainability (economic, environmental and social) indicators. However, the d egree of the sustainability of the supply chain was measured only for 2000, because of a considerable lack of available data for 1990. Thus it was not feasible to draw conclusions on the changes of supply chain sustainability over the last decade. It was shown that the farm stage was responsible for most of the emissions to the environment and water consumption in 2000. Most of the energy was consumed at the farm and merchant stages, while the merchant stage was the most labour intensive in the supply chain. A questionnaire survey of 240 farmers, 17 merchants and 4 retailers was carried out to elicit their perceptions of the importance of selected sustainability factors influencing supply chain performance, the changes in business sustainability during the last decade, {{and the future of the}} <b>fresh</b> <b>potato</b> supply chain. The participants perceived that their business profitability has either been stable or decreased, while cost efficiency and environmental and social performance have improved. During the last 10 years, economic factors have been the key drivers for change in the supply chain, however environmental and social issues have increased in importance and are likely to do so in the future. The participants perceived that major retailers, driven by the fierce competition at the retail stage where the power base for the supply chain appears to lie, have promoted actions to improve aspects of the sustainability of the whole fresh produce supply chain, such as farm assurance schemes. This study confirmed that it is feasible to develop an approach to assess the sustainability of fresh produce supply chains over time. These sustainability indicators could be further developed and applied in the <b>fresh</b> <b>potato</b> supply chain on a regular basis in the future to provide an ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the changes in the supply chain performance in an objective manner. The developed approach could also be applied on other fresh vegetables supply chains. The study concludes that it is in the collective interest of all participants in the <b>fresh</b> <b>potato</b> supply chain to find ways to improve its economic, social and environmental performance...|$|R

50|$|Prior to the 1940s, only {{dry farming}} {{existed in the}} area. An {{irrigation}} project diverting water from the Deschutes River boosted farming output and the town began to grow again. http://www.madraschamber.com/metolius.cfm Through an extensive canal system, water from the Deschutes river reaches the area.

Four giant packing sheds stored fresh packed potatoes and delivered them onto railroad cars. A frozen French fry factory employed many workers year round. In 1968 a potato blight of nematodes ended large scale potato production in this area. In 1973 the railroad closed its depot in Metolius. By 1990 almost all mint production had ended due to root rot.

50|$|The {{situation}} {{was very different}} for the poor, who made up 75% {{of the population of}} around nine million by 1840. Potatoes form the basis for many Irish dishes and indeed were eaten both by the Anglo-Irish gentry and the mass of the people. Which was unusual as the potato was shunned in most of Europe for centuries after its introduction, particularly by the elites. The potato was first introduced into Ireland {{in the second half of}} the 16th century, initially as a garden crop. It eventually came to be the main food crop of the poor. As a food source, the potato is extremely valuable in terms of the amount of energy produced per unit area of crop.

5000|$|In Sweden, dill is {{a common}} spice or herb. The top of fully grown dill is called {{krondill}} (English: Crown dill); this is used when cooking crayfish. The krondill is put into the water after the crayfish is boiled, but still in hot and salt water. Then the entire dish is stored in refrigerator for at least 24 hours before eating (with toasted bread and butter). Krondill is also used for cucumber pickles. Small cucumbers, sliced or not, are put into a solution of hot water, mild acetic vinegar (not made from wine and without colour), sugar and krondill. After a month or two, the cucumber pickles are ready to eat, for instance, with pork, brown sauce and potatoes, as a [...] "sweetener". The thinner part of dill and young plants may be used with boiled <b>fresh</b> <b>potatoes</b> (as the first potatoes for the year, which usually are small and have a very thin skin). It is used together with, or instead of other green herbs, like parsley, chives and basil, in salads. It is also often paired up with chives when used in food.

In contrast to the various fish dishes flavoured with dill, there is also a traditional Swedish dish called dillkött, which is a meaty stew flavoured with dill. The dish commonly contains either pieces of veal or lamb that are boiled until tender and then served together with a vinegary dill sauce. Dill seeds may be used in breads or akvavit.
