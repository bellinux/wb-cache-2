5|$|Approximately {{one hour}} later, HiryÅ«'s second attack wave, {{consisting}} of ten B5Ns and six escorting A6Ms, arrived over Yorktown; the repair efforts <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> effective that the Japanese pilots assumed that Yorktown {{must be a}} different, undamaged carrier. They attacked, crippling Yorktown with two torpedoes; she lost all power and developed a 23-degree list to port. Five torpedo bombers and two fighters were shot down in this attack.|$|E

5|$|During this period, 1st Airborne Division was {{composed}} of only two parachute battalions, of which only one (1st Parachute Battalion), was fully trained. Browning, wishing to keep 1st Parachute Battalion intact for any larger operation the division might be selected for, ordered 2nd Parachute Battalion to provide a company for the operation.

In 1898 he suffered an attack of influenza, and had apparently recovered when he was again taken suddenly ill, and died on 17June 1898. Six days later, at the intervention of the Prince of Wales, a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey. It was the first time an artist <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> honoured.

5|$|Both Murphy and Universal gave serious {{considerations}} to {{a follow-up}} {{version of his}} post-war life. Murphy rejected the Richard J.

Spec McClure scripted a second unused version of The Way Back that incorporated Murphy's real-life friends into the storyline and ended with the star living happily ever after with Pamela and their two sons. A third version by an unknown writer focused on the Murphy-McClure friendship and {{was rejected by the}} threat of a lawsuit from McClure. Desi Arnaz offered to bankroll a 1965 project titled Helmets in the Dust. At Murphy's request McClure wrote a film treatment, but the project never came to fruition.|$|E

5|$|By 14 August, large {{forces from}} the NK 5th and 12th Divisions, as well was the 766th Independent Regiment were focused entirely on taking P'ohang-dong.

More importantly, the supply chain had completely broken down for the division, and more food, ammunition and supplies were not available.

5|$|Gilbert brought suit, {{and after}} The Gondoliers closed in 1891, he withdrew the {{performance}} rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy. Gilbert next wrote The Mountebanks with Alfred Cellier and the flop Haste to the Wedding with George Grossmith, and Sullivan wrote Haddon Hall with Sydney Grundy. Gilbert eventually won the lawsuit and felt vindicated, but his actions and statements had been hurtful to his partners. Nevertheless, the partnership <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> profitable that, after the financial {{failure of the}} Royal English Opera House, Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, as {{evolutionary}} theorists {{explored the}} possibility of multiple units of selection, ecologists turned to evolutionary approaches. In population ecology, debate over group selection was brief but vigorous; by 1970, most biologists agreed that natural selection was rarely effective above the level of individual organisms. The evolution of ecosystems, however, became a lasting research focus. Ecology expanded rapidly {{with the rise of}} the environmental movement; the International Biological Program attempted to apply the methods of big science (which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> successful in the physical sciences) to ecosystem ecology and pressing environmental issues, while smaller-scale independent efforts such as island biogeography and the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest helped redefine the scope of an increasingly diverse discipline.|$|E
