40|$|This brief {{examines}} {{an issue}} of current importance to the conduct of U. S. economic policy: how has the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) plan to purchase up to $ 600 billion of Treasury securities by June 30, 2011 affected the movement of inflation, GDP, and employment to more desirable medium-term and long-term levels? Following the FOMC’s announcement of the plan on November 3, 2010, other events that potentially influence Treasury yields have been at play. To estimate the effects that the FOMC Treasury purchases may have on the goal of achieving more desirable levels of inflation and employment, the authors make use of different models to gauge the likely effect upon interest rates, the interest rate effects on real spending (GDP), and how changes in GDP may be affecting the employment rate.

The goal is to make some difficult analysis manageable. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the groups that arose in this connection were the circle R/ 2 #Z, the line R, and finite abelian groups. Embedded in applications were decompositions of functions in terms of multiplicative characters, continuous homomorphisms of the group into the nonzero complex numbers. In the case of the circle, the decomposition is just the expansion of a function on (-#,#) into its Fourier series Anthony W.

In particular, we use the ART neural network as a building block, and name our architecture SMART (for Self-consistent Modular ART). We also show some experimental results for "proof-of-concept" using the ARTMAP network, that can be seen as an implementation of a two-level SMART network.

In particular, we will show that the anomalous situation that is claimed in [6] never to arise when (binary) input patterns have the same number of 1 's can in fact occur. We have constructed a class of counter-examples, and have given necessary conditions for the network parameters, for which a given sequence of the example patterns will drive the network into the error condition. A concrete example is also given to illustrate the result of the analysis of the problem. Results of some further experiments have supported our claims, and also suggested there might be some other, more general conditions for the match tracking problem.

40|$|In this paper, we {{emphasize}} that choice sets {{generated by a}} search process have two properties: first, they are limited; second, they are endogenous to preferences. Both factors lead to biased estimates in a static demand framework that takes choice sets as given. To correct for this bias, we estimate a structural model of search for differentiated products, using a unique dataset of consumer online search for hotels. Within a nested logit utility model, we show that the mean utility function and the search cost distribution of a representative consumer are non-parametrically identified, given our data. Using our model’s estimates, we quantify both sources of bias: they lead to overestimation of price elasticity {{by a factor of}} five and four, respectively. The median search cost is about 38 dollars per 15 hotels; we also present some evidence on multi-modality of search cost distribution.

40|$|In this expository {{paper we}} {{describe}} some recent {{work in the}} cohomology of finite groups. In particular, we discuss techniques for calculation and how they apply to key examples from group theory, namely, the sporadic simple groups. We also mention recent theoretical results arising from these calculations and interactions between algebra and topology which occur {{in the context of}} finite group cohomology. Definitions and Motivation Let G denote a finite group. One of the basic tools for understanding G is its expression as a group extension 1 → N → G → K → 1 where N is a normal subgroup in G and K is the quotient G/N. An obvious problem is to try to understand all extensions of this type and indeed determine what different groups can arise in this way. Assume that N is abelian; if we choose a section φ: K → G, k ↦ → gk, then the group structure on G implies that for k, l ∈ K there must exist nk,l ∈ N such that gkgl = nk,lgkl. This defines a function K × K → N satisfying certain “cocycle properties”.

40|$|Much recent {{commentary}} {{has centered}} {{on the importance of}} well-anchored inflation expectations as the foundation of a well-behaved inflation rate. But the difficulty in relying on this principle is that inflation expectations are not directly observable. Thus {{it is hard to know}} whether expectations play such an anchoring role in the evolution of inflation. In the current circumstances this question is of much more than academic interest, as widely used measures suggest the coincidence of a large unemployment gap and muted production costs with fairly stable long-run inflation expectations. While a high unemployment rate and muted production costs would tend to depress inflation, well-anchored inflation expectations may serve as a counterweight to downward pressure. Which effect will prevail? This brief examines the role of expectations and anchoring by employing expectations proxies derived from surveys of professional forecasters. The brief concludes that there is some evidence that stable long-run expectations have an indirect anchoring effect on inflation, but that the effect of resource slack to date remains considerable.

Although the effects of income disparity are well accepted, {{one of the reasons}} for the success of this type of analysis is that many policy-makers and analysts consider the results of a well-crafted analysis to be largely free of partisan or political bias. Here I propose that tradeoff between the benefits of various possible jobs or careers introduce a significant bias into values imputed based upon willingness to pay measures. In particular, I demonstrate why we might expect the values of various segments of society to be differentially appreciated by CBA. Empirical evidence is presented indicating that there is a significant negative correlation between the importance an individual places on income and the willingness of that individual to forgo consumption in favor of environmental improvement, as well as a correlation between the importance of income and actual income. These results suggest that CBA as a tool of welfare economics is likely to be biased against environmental protection because concerned individuals are likely to choose careers which do not maximize consumption, thus decreasing their ability to pay for both real and hypothetical environmental improvements. Moreover, the size of this bias appears to be large...|$|E

I believe that the absence of math literacy in urban and rural communities throughout this country is an issue as urgent as the lack of registered black voters in Mississippi was in 1961 …[M]ath literacy—and algebra in particular—is the key to the future of disenfranchised communities.

In Part II Moses describes the Algebra Project, which grew out of his efforts to improve the teaching of math in his own children’s middle school in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the early 1980 s. Alarmed that his oldest child would not be adequately prepared for the college-prep track in high school, Moses volunteered to teach beginning algebra to her and several of her more advanced classmates.

Analysts examining complex simulation models often conduct screening experiments to identify the most important factors. Controlled sequential bifurcation (CSB) is a screening procedure, developed specifically for simulation experiments, that uses a sequence of hypothesis tests to classify the factors as either important or unimportant. CSB controls the probability of Type I error for each factor, and the power at each bifurcation step, under heterogeneous variance conditions. CSB does, however, require the user to correctly state the directions of the effects prior to running the experiments. Experience indicates {{that this can be}} problematic with complex simulations. We propose a hybrid two-phase approach, FF-CSB, to relax this requirement. Phase 1 uses an efficient fractional factorial experiment to estimate the signs and magnitudes of the effects.
