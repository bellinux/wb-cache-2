40|$|ABSTRACT: One {{hundred and}} twenty-seven hips in 125 adults were treated for {{traumatic}} posterior dislo-cation {{during a period}} of two decades. Ninety-eight pa-tients (100 hips) were available for follow-up exami-nation at a minimum of five years (average, fourteen years) after injury. By both clinical and radiographic criteria eighty hips (80 per cent) <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> or good result. Forty-two per cent of the hips that were reduced more than six hours after the dislocation <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> or good result and 88 per cent of those that were reduced within six hours after dislocation <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> or good result.

The project carefully restored logging machinery, railroad equipment, historic buildings, and other museum artifacts. Interpretive displays, signs, and other materials were also updated. As a result, Collier Memorial State Park <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> museum with a world-class collection of logging equipment and artifacts.|$|E

25|$|It prefers heavy, gravelly {{soil with}} {{excellent}} drainage, {{in a sunny}} position. It is drought tolerant, and frost tolerant down to -7°C. Plants become straggly and untidy with age, so should be pruned when young. Propagation is by seed, as the hairy stems of this plant make it virtually impossible to strike stem cuttings, and heel cuttings have been met with limited success. Germination takes three to four weeks, and <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> success rate. Flowering usually begins at {{three to four years}} from seed.|$|E
25|$|Countries {{and local}} governments have taken {{political}} steps in reducing maternal deaths. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute studied maternal health systems in four apparently similar countries: Rwanda, Malawi, Niger, and Uganda. In comparison to the other three countries, Rwanda <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> recent record of improving maternal death rates. Based on their investigation of these varying country case studies, the researchers conclude that improving maternal health depends on three key factors: 1. reviewing all maternal health-related policies frequently {{to ensure that they}} are internally coherent; 2. enforcing standards on providers of maternal health services; 3. any local solutions to problems discovered should be promoted, not discouraged.|$|E

ONEA’s and the government’s mutual responsibilities are laid out in three-year performance contracts (contracts plans) with explicit operational targets.

It has the authority to appoint (and fire) the general manager and determine employees’ pay scales, while a general manager makes day-to-day operational decisions. The utility is allowed to cut off service for nonpayment of water bills, and its workers are subject to private sector (not civil service) rules.|$|E
25|$|Many {{sports are}} practised in São Vicente, {{and many have}} spread to the {{remaining}} islands. The island is suitable for windsurfing; the beach of São Pedro {{is considered one of}} the best for windsurfing, as shown by the many world-class champions of the sport. Cycling, walking trails and horseback riding are ways to explore the island. São Vicente <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> 18-hole golf course. For these reasons, tourism has excellent growth potential on São Vicente and in the rest of the Cape Verde archipelago. Travel between the diverse localities of the island is provided by a system of public transportation operated by five private companies: Transcor.SA, Morabeza Transport, Transport Joy, Friendship, Sotral and Automindelo. However, especially for places farthest from the city of the Mindelo, namely Baía das Gatas, Calhau, and São Pedro, van and bus leasing are the usual forms of transportation.|$|E
25|$|Port Colborne {{hosts the}} annual Canal Days festival in {{recognition}} of the important role played by the Welland Canal {{in the history of the}} city. Originating as a small fair held at the Port Colborne Historical and Marine Museum, it has grown to feature live music, an antique car show, fireworks, tall ships, a kite festival, and food from around the globe. The festival also highlights the presence of Lock 8, which at 420 m (1,380ft), is one of the world's longest canal locks. The lock is intended as a guard to keep the water level on the Welland Canal constant independent of weather on the lake. Hence the ships are only raised or lowered one to four feet depending on the current water level in Lake Erie. Much of the festival centres around West St., which runs along the side of the canal, and <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> view of the Clarence St. Bridge, built in 1929. one of very few remaining lift bridges on the canal.|$|E
