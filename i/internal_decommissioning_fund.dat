40|$|This paper {{explores the}} trends over 1997 - 2001 in my {{baseline}} simulation {{analysis of the}} sufficiency of electric utilities' <b>funds</b> to eventually <b>decommission</b> the nation's nuclear power plants. Further, for 2001, I describe the utilities' funding adequacy results obtained using scenario and sensitivity analyses, respectively. In this paper, I {{focus more on the}} wide variability observed in these adequacy measures among utilities than on the results for the ''average'' utility in the nuclear industry. Only individual utilities, not average utilities [...] often used by the nuclear industry to represent its funding adequacy [...] will decommission their nuclear plants. Industry-wide results tend to mask the varied results for individual utilities. This paper shows that over 1997 - 2001, the variability of my baseline <b>decommissioning</b> <b>funding</b> adequacy measures (in percentages) for both utility fund balances and current contributions has remained very large, reflected in the sizable ranges and frequency distributions of these percentages. The relevance of this variability for nuclear <b>decommissioning</b> <b>funding</b> adequacy is, of course, focused more on those utilities that show below ideal balances and contribution levels. Looking backward, 42 of 67 utility fund (available) balances, in 2001, were above (and 25 below) their ideal baseline levels; in 1997, 42 of 76 were above (and 34 below) ideal levels. Of these, many utility balances were far above, and many far below, such ideal levels. The problem of certain utilities continuing to show balances much below ideal persists even with increases in the adequacy of ''average'' utility balances...|$|R
