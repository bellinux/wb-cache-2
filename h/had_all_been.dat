5|$|Rebeccah Cradock, Matthew's second wife, {{remarried}} to Benjamin Whichcote, another senior {{figure of}} the Cambridge Platonists, Provost of King's College, Cambridge, a close colleague of Ralph Cudworth's. Both were closely associated with Mathew Cradock's nephew, Samuel Cradock (a pupil of Whichcote's), whose brother Zachary was Provost of Eton College. Cudworth, Whichcote and Samuel Cradock <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> students at Emmanuel College, Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russo-Japanese War the Imperial Russian Navy was in a {{state of}} confusion. Its leadership, tactics and ship designs <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> cast into disrepute by its {{repeated}} defeats by the Japanese at the Battle of Tsushima, Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of the Yellow Sea. The Navy took quite some time to absorb the design lessons from the war while the government reformed the Naval Ministry and forced many of its more conservative officers to retire. It conducted a design contest for a dreadnought in 1906, but the Duma refused to authorize it, preferring to spend the money on rebuilding the Army.|$|E

5|$|Allemand {{requested}} that Cotes come aboard Carmagnole, but Cotes responded {{that he was}} unable to do so as his ship's boats <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> destroyed. Allemand sent a boat from his own ship to Thames and brought Cotes to Carmagnole as a prisoner of war; Cotes used the delay to destroy his ship's documents. Allemand questioned Cotes intently about the nature of his recent combat and, on identifying Uranie as one of his own squadron, commented that Tartu should have defeated Thames in half the time the action had taken.|$|E
5|$|Although {{late and}} over-budget the {{decision}} to cancel the MRA4 was controversial as the remaining airframes <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> near completion. It {{has been reported that}} following the retirement of the Nimrod MR2 (in March 2010.), Russian submarines have been able to travel past the UK in international waters, but they could not be tracked {{because of the lack of}} suitable aircraft. In November and early December 2014 four maritime patrol aircraft operated by France, Canada and the United States were based at RAF Lossiemouth to attempt to locate a Russian submarine which had been spotted in British territorial waters off west Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Development for {{the film}} started in 1980, but did not {{progress}} until 1997, when the film rights to Abagnale's book were sold to Spielberg's DreamWorks. David Fincher, Gore Verbinski, Lasse Hallström, Miloš Forman, and Cameron Crowe <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> possible candidates for director before Spielberg decided to direct. Filming took place from February to May 2002. The film was a financial and critical success, and was received positively by Abagnale.|$|E
5|$|During the 14th century, {{however, the}} castle had {{declined}} and became abandoned. In 1398 Richard II had the lead {{taken from the}} castle roofs for reuse at Portchester Castle. In 1660, visitors' accounts imply that the stonework <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> dismantled, and 18th-century accounts suggest that this was reused for construction work in the town below, which had prospered from the wool and later linen trade.|$|E

The order to shoot was given by the patrol's apparent leader, James McDowell, to eliminate witnesses to the bogus checkpoint and subsequent bombing. Three of the musicians were killed: lead singer Fran O'Toole, trumpeter Brian McCoy, and guitarist Tony Geraghty.|$|E
5|$|Hansa {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Royal Dockyard in Danzig in 1868. She was the first ironclad warship {{to be built in}} a German shipyard; her {{predecessors}} <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> built in French and British shipyards. The ship was launched on 26 October 1872 and moved to the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin for fitting out work. The work proceeded very slowly, and Hansa was not commissioned into the German fleet until 19 May 1875, {{two and a half years}} after her launch. By comparison, all of the earlier foreign-built ironclads were completed in less than a year.|$|E
5|$|Keyser and de Houtman {{assigned}} {{twelve stars}} to the constellation. Bayer depicted Grus on his chart, {{but did not}} assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Phi in 1756 with some omissions. In 1879, American astronomer Benjamin Gould added Kappa, Nu, Omicron and Xi, which <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> catalogued by Lacaille but not given Bayer designations. Lacaille considered them too faint, while Gould thought otherwise. Xi Gruis had originally been placed in Microscopium. Conversely, Gould dropped Lacaille's Sigma as {{he thought it was}} too dim.|$|E

5|$|Mitcham Cricket Club {{was formed}} in 1685, the club playing on what is today known as Mitcham Cricket Green. The site has hosted cricket matches ever since. Mitcham is {{believed}} to be the world's oldest cricket club as there is no evidence of any club being founded before 1685. Croydon, Dartford and London <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> founded by the 1720s but their dates of origin have been lost, although there was an actual reference to a London Club in 1722.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{estimated}} 30,000 to 40,000 people who reached Dawson City during the gold rush, only around 15,000 to 20,000 finally became prospectors. Of these, {{no more than}} 4,000 struck gold {{and only a few}} hundred became rich. By the time most of the stampeders arrived in 1898, the best creeks <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> claimed, either by the long-term miners in the region, or by the first arrivals of the year before. The Bonanza, Eldorado, Hunker and Dominion Creeks were all taken, with almost 10,000 claims recorded by the authorities by July 1898; a new prospector would have to look further afield to find a claim of his own.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{this move}} to the Vanilla Studios {{rehearsal}} space, the Clash's songwriters Mick Jones and Joe Strummer had experienced a period of writer's block. They had not written a new song from scratch in over a year, with the material on their recently released Cost of Living EP, composed of a cover song and three songs that <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> written over twelve months earlier. The Clash arrived at Vanilla in May 1979 without a single new song prepared for their third album.|$|E

5|$|The company {{adapted the}} old {{gas station and}} café to act as the community's chamber of {{commerce}} and visitor center while preserving the building's architectural features and historical authenticity. Old photographs and interviews with residents were used to aid the company in uncovering the buildings original details. They peeled away decades of paint layers and fabric to find the original interior and exterior colors. One of the more difficult aspects was in restoring the neon accents. While historical photographs showed where neon existed, they <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> taken during the daytime when the neon lights were off, {{making it difficult to}} determine what color the lights originally were.|$|E
5|$|The leading figures <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> {{supporters}} of the reform, but {{they were no longer}} united. Relations between Archbishop Dunstan and Bishop Æthelwold may have been strained. Archbishop Oswald was at odds with Ealdorman Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia, while Ælfhere and his kin were rivals for power with the affinity of Æthelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia. Dunstan was said to have questioned Edgar's marriage to Queen Dowager Ælfthryth and the legitimacy of their son Æthelred.|$|E
5|$|U-10 was {{the first}} ship of the class {{launched}}, as the German UB-1 on 22 January 1915. The other four boats were launched by April. UB-1 and UB-15 were initially commissioned into the Kaiserliche Marine in January and April, respectively, each with German commanders and crew, but with an Austro-Hungarian Navy officer for piloting and training purposes, but both were commissioned into the K.u.K. Kriegsmarine with Austro-Hungarian crews by July. The other three ships were never manned by German crews and <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>been</b> commissioned by early October when each is listed in sources with a commanding officer.|$|E
