5|$|In January 2013, Jean-Claude Van Damme {{was rumored}} to be co-starring {{alongside}} Jaa; in reality, he was never available due to scheduling issues, and as a result, Lundgren was cast as an alternative. The film entered production in April 2013, but {{came to an abrupt}} halt after three months of filming. Sahamongkol Film International filed a $49–50 million lawsuit against Jaa, Universal Pictures, and United International Pictures, claiming Jaa was in breach of his contract by accepting a role in <b>Fast</b> <b>and</b> <b>Furious</b> 7. After two years of legal proceedings, Sahamongkol dropped the lawsuit in July 2015. Despite this, production of A Man Will Rise has not continued, and the film remains uncompleted.|$|E
5|$|Fast Five is {{the ninth}} highest-grossing 2011 film, the third highest-grossing {{film of the}} <b>Fast</b> <b>and</b> <b>Furious</b> {{franchise}} (behind Fast 6 and Furious 7) and the fifth highest-grossing Universal film. It was initially released in Australia on Wednesday, April 20, 2011– nine days before the release date in North America– followed by releases in the UK, South Korea and New Zealand. The earlier start in these countries was timed to coincide with their Easter holidays and avoided competition from forthcoming summer films, although this placed it in direct competition with Thor in some countries. By {{the end of its}} opening weekend, the film had accrued a total of $23.4 million from these countries. On its second weekend, Fast Five earned $46.3 million across 3,139 theaters in 14 countries, ranking first at the box office in each of its ten new markets.

5|$|In the United States and Canada Alice in Wonderland is the forty-fourth-highest-grossing film {{but out of}} the top 100 when {{adjusted}} for inflation. It is also the second-highest-grossing 2010 film, behind Toy Story 3, the second-highest-grossing film starring Johnny Depp and the highest-grossing film directed by Tim Burton.

25|$|The crags of Dove Crag are the fell's finest feature. The crag {{is about}} 75 metres high {{at its highest}} point and is a popular venue for rock climbers with classic routes such as Extol and <b>Fast</b> <b>and</b> <b>Furious.</b> Lately it has become used by boulderers with several top-class climbs such as Impailed and Pail Attitude on the {{boulders}} that have become detached from the main crag. Concealed within the crags is the “Priest's Hole”. This is a cave, roughly about five metres deep with extra protection provided by a wall built in front, which is often used by walkers and climbers as a rough overnight camp. It is well used and stocked (even having a visitors' book) {{but it is not}} easy to find in bad conditions. It is marked on the large-scale Ordnance Survey maps but this is only of limited use. It is not mentioned by Alfred Wainwright in his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, which suggests that he did not know of its existence.

500|$|Filming {{began in}} April 2013; Jaa was {{announced}} as co-director the same month. After {{three months of}} filming, production {{came to an abrupt}} halt with only 20% of the film complete. Sahamongkol Film International filed a $49–50 million lawsuit against Jaa, Universal Pictures, and United International Pictures in September 2013, claiming that Jaa was in breach of his contract by accepting the role of Kiet in <b>Fast</b> <b>and</b> <b>Furious</b> 7. Sahamongkol based their sum on the cost of launching Jaa's career and loss of future earnings, plus an additional 7.5% interest. They attempted to halt the release of <b>Fast</b> <b>and</b> <b>Furious</b> 7 in Thailand, and on March 27, 2015, a civil court approved, blocking release the film until a settlement had been reached by both parties. The court came to its decision after interviewing two employees of Sahamongkol: Akarapol Karasaranee, the son of the company's president, Somsak Techaratanaprasert; and Suwat Apaipak, a member of Sahamongkol's legal team. In response to the allegations, Jaa stated that his contract with Sahamongkol had ended. He claimed that it was terminated through his lawyer in 2013, describing it as [...] "business slavery" [...] due to its allegedly overrestrictive terms and conditions. Sahamongkol claimed that the contract had been renewed for another ten years, through 2023. In the suit, Sahamangkol also requested that Jaa pay back his salary for A Man Will Rise, reportedly ฿26 million ($722,000). The legal matters surrounding the lawsuit have prevented the completion of the film, and although the lawsuit was dropped in July 2015, the film remains unfinished. There are currently no plans to complete the film.|$|E
