50|$|Verbeke {{became a}} public figure in 1977 when, {{together}} with the later Vlaams Blok ideologist and senator Roeland Raes, he founded the Flemish denial magazine Haro. This magazine distributed tapes from various speeches made by Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Göring. During this period, {{he also was a}} member of the Vlaamse Militanten Orde (<b>Flemish</b> <b>Militants</b> <b>Order),</b> an organisation that became notorious for its attacks on immigrants, Walloons, and socialists. The government began dismantling the organisation in 1981 and it had ceased to exist by the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Around 1900 the anthem was {{in general}} use among <b>Flemish</b> <b>militants.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Order</b> of <b>Flemish</b> <b>Militants</b> (Vlaamse Militanten Orde or VMO) - {{originally}} the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Militants</b> Organisation (Vlaamse Militanten Organisatie) - was a Flemish nationalist activist group in Belgium defending far-right interests by propaganda and political action. Established in 1949, they {{helped found the}} People's Union (Volksunie or VU) in 1954, a Belgian political party. The links between the extremist VMO and the VU lessened as the party moved towards the centre. In later decades the VMO would become linked to neo-Nazism {{and a series of}} paramilitary attacks on immigrants and leftists before disappearing by the late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The party {{attempted}} to gain international contacts, {{and during the}} 1970s took part in annual international neo-Nazi rallies at Diksmuide in Belgium, alongside such groups as the <b>Order</b> of <b>Flemish</b> <b>militants</b> and the United Kingdom - based League of Saint George. Before that the party had been close to the British extremist leader John Tyndall and his Greater Britain Movement after Tyndall had failed in his attempts to forge links with George Lincoln Rockwell.|$|R
50|$|In 1965, a {{decorated}} war hero, he was dubbed Knight Commander of the <b>Militant</b> <b>Order</b> of Saint Bridget of Sweden.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{linguistic}} law is also regarded as dangerous by <b>Flemish</b> <b>militants</b> because according to them, {{it contributes to}} territorial nibbling in favour of the French language. The wallingants then put agreement with the flamingants. On 16 March 1929, wallingant Destrée and flamingant Camille Huysmans sign, with 26 other socialist deputies within the P.O.B, the [...] "Compromis des Belges" [...] (Compromise of the Belgians) for the linguistic and cultural homogeneity of the Flanders and Wallonia, leading to the linguistic law of 14 July 1932. It prescribes Dutch as the official language of the Flanders, and French as official language of Wallonia, consciously sacrificing the linguistic rights of the French-speaking people of Flanders.|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Elbers, who, in his songs, {{appears to}} be a bohemian and anti-bourgeois, {{became a member of the}} <b>Order</b> of <b>Flemish</b> <b>militants</b> (VMO), an activist group, in order to {{participate}} in a more structured way to the Flemish resistance. At the age of 19, he went to Canada to harvest tobacco. Upon his return, with his brother Wim he brought new life to the inactive department of the People's Union (Volksunie) in Schaarbeek. In 1969, an activist of the so-called Democratic Front of Francophones (FDF) with a not very good health suffers from a heart attack during an action of the VMO. After this incident, the VU seems to dissociate from its activists. Disappointed, Elbers then withdraws from active political life.|$|R
50|$|In the World of Greyhawk {{campaign}} {{setting for}} the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, the Knights of the Hart is a chivalric order in the Flanaess. They {{are one of the}} least <b>militant</b> <b>orders</b> in the Flanaess, although that reputation is changing {{since the end of the}} Greyhawk Wars.|$|R
50|$|On {{his return}} to the United States, Kaltenbach resumed {{teaching}} in Dubuque. In 1935 he started a club for boys based on the Hitler Youth movement, The <b>Militant</b> <b>Order</b> of Spartan Knights. It held secret initiation rituals and the boys wore brown military-style uniforms. Because of the concern of parents, Kaltenbach’s teaching contract was terminated in June 1936.|$|R
2500|$|In 1983, Tyndall {{sought to}} make an electoral impact by fielding 53 {{candidates}} in the 1983 general election, which guaranteed a free party broadcast. This broadcast featured Tyndall flanked by two British flags, and included footage of the Brixton riot, a violent clash between predominantly black local residents and the police. All of the BNP's candidates combined [...] including Tyndall and his wife Valerie [...] achieved only 14,621 votes {{and as a result}} they lost all of their deposits. It was revealed afterwards that the BNP Deputy Chairman Ray Hill had been working as a mole on behalf of the anti-fascist magazine Searchlight. During the mid-1980s, Tyndall's BNP absorbed numerous existing NF Flag Group branches including Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, and Glasgow. The party also began to develop friendly relations with the Federation of Conservative Students. The BNP also made contacts elsewhere on Europe, particularly with Flemish nationalists of the radical Odal Group, which succeeded the <b>Order</b> of <b>Flemish</b> <b>Militants.</b>|$|R
500|$|In late 1977, the {{rejection}} of the Egmont pact by the hardliner faction of the People's Union led to the establishment of two new (short-lived) parties; the radical nationalist Flemish National Party (VNP) and the national liberal Flemish People's Party (VVP), respectively led by Karel Dillen and Lode Claes. The parties contested the 1978 general elections in a coalition called [...] "Vlaams Blok", where they won 1.4% of the vote and one seat in the Chamber of Representatives (taken by Dillen). On 28 May 1979, the VNP and VVP finally merged to form a new party named Vlaams Blok, and Dillen was nominated to be the party's leader for life. The party initially recruited its members from Flemish nationalist organisations, such as the Taal Aktie Komitee, Voorpost, Were Di, and the <b>Order</b> of <b>Flemish</b> <b>Militants,</b> while some local groups also simply turned into local branches of the Vlaams Blok. In its inception, the party was widely regarded as a conservative separatist party, rather than an extreme right-wing party.|$|R
25|$|In 1994, {{the sons}} of Ahmad Salama Mabruk and Mohammed Sharaf were {{executed}} under al-Zawahiri's leadership for betraying Egyptian Islamic Jihad; the <b>militants</b> were <b>ordered</b> to leave the Sudan.|$|R
50|$|In {{preparation}} for their roles, all actors {{spent time with}} their real-life alter egos. Humayun Saeed, who {{plays the role of}} a militant, spent days with captured <b>militants</b> in <b>order</b> to prepare for his role.|$|R
5000|$|The First World War {{revived the}} patriotism in Belgium, {{especially}} after {{the application of the}} Flamenpolitik by German occupying forces during the war. Even though the majority of the wallingant and flamingant organizations ceased their activities, a minority of Walloon and <b>Flemish</b> <b>militants</b> collaborated with the Germans. Walloon activism is even more marginal than the Flemish side, but it seemed less handled by the German authorities than this last. At the end of the war, Walloon and Flemish activists will be severely judged but only Flemish activism will be used during the interbellum against Flemish revendications since Spring 1919, whereas Walloon activism sinks into oblivion, the French-speaking press and also Wallingant propaganda papers to buckle down to create an image of a [...] "Flandre embochée" [...] (German-friendly Flanders):It is true that French-speaking press won't cease to discredit on all flemish by amalgaming it with activists' actions led under the high patronage of the hatred Germany. Indeed, since Spring 1919, press articles begin to associate activism and Flemish Movement; that will create an image of a [...] "Flandre embochée" ... At the end of the war, walloon activists are judged with the same virulence that their flemish counterparts and for the same reasons. But, once condemned, they disappear from memories; whereas flemish activism is more and more used against flemish revendications.|$|R
50|$|In the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict, Israel {{claimed that}} over 30 {{underground}} attack tunnels were discovered under the Israel-Gaza Border {{which are used}} by <b>militants</b> in <b>order</b> to infiltrate Israel. It also claimed that over 600,000 tons of cement required to construct the tunnels was originally designated for humanitarian aid and diverted.|$|R
50|$|The {{head of the}} Elene Church is the Archprelate, who is {{equivalent}} to the Pope in the Roman Catholic Church. The Archprelate is elected by a congress of Patriarchs, who are analogus to cardinals in the Catholic Church. (In real Christendom, a Patriarch is the head of one of the Orthodox churches). A Patriarch is usually in charge of the religious administration of a city; e.g. Dolmant is the Patriarch of Demos, Bergsten is the Patriarch of Emsat). So a Patriarch also seems to undertake the duties of local diocesan Catholic bishops or archbishops; in fact, the archbishops of several cities are usually made cardinals). The four preceptors of the <b>Militant</b> <b>Orders</b> (the Church Knights) also hold the rank of Patriarch. Each Patriarch (minus the Preceptors) seems to have a squad of Church soldiers at their command to ensure their protection.|$|R
50|$|Fadrique was a twin to Henry of Trastámara. While {{his father}} lived, the {{children}} of Eleanor profited from appointments and royal grants. With this backing, in 1342, Fadrique rose to the leading role of Maestre of the <b>militant</b> monastic <b>Order</b> of Santiago. The prior Maestre had been Alonso Meléndez de Guzmán, his maternal uncle.|$|R
50|$|Pakistan has {{repeatedly}} accused India {{of supporting the}} Baloch <b>militant</b> groups in <b>order</b> to destabilize the country. India has categorically denied the allegation, stating that no concrete evidence has been provided.|$|R
50|$|In the Zeitoun incident, UNRWA {{ambulances}} {{were used}} as transport by healthy Palestinian fighters. In an interview with Haaretz, Israel's Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz also said that UNRWA's ambulances were used by Palestinian <b>militants</b> in <b>order</b> to smuggle some of the remains of IDF soldiers killed in Zaitoun neighbourhood in Gaza on May 11, 2004. UNRWA has described the May 11 incident as a hijacking.|$|R
2500|$|It {{was to be}} a short {{occupation}} of both palace and power. By 25 October 1917, the Provisional Government was failing and, realising the palace was a target for the more <b>militant</b> Bolsheviks, <b>ordered</b> its defence.

50|$|Hamas-aligned militants {{occupied}} the PGFTU's Gaza headquarters in July 2007, removed {{all of the}} existing slogans and flags, and raised a Hamas flag over the building. According to a statement issued by the PGFTU, the <b>militants</b> then <b>ordered</b> the union's staff to discuss how {{they were going to}} operate under Hamas rule. Saed called for Hamas to return the building to PGFTU control, and expressed concern that the conflict could prevent 200,000 workers from receiving health insurance benefits.|$|R
5000|$|Following the 1994 {{execution}} of the sons of Ahmad Salama Mabruk and Mohammed Sharaf for betraying Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the <b>militants</b> were <b>ordered</b> to leave the Sudan. Kherchtou disobeyed orders to relocate to Afghanistan, claiming {{he was concerned about}} the education his children would receive in such a country, although he is also believed to have still felt snubbed after being refused financial compensation for his wife's operation, and subsequently [...] "began to drift away" [...] from al-Qaeda.|$|R
5000|$|After [...] "hill top youth" [...] {{attacked}} an Israeli army base in 2011, Ariel protested Israeli {{officials who}} called the group [...] "terrorists", and condemned calls {{for the use of}} lethal force to repel such attacks in the future. In January 2012, Ariel admitted to giving IDF troop movement information to such <b>militants</b> in <b>order</b> to facilitate disruption of army activities, saying, [...] "If a person who transfers information about IDF movements is a spy, then I am a spy".|$|R
50|$|The Ecclesiarchy, though {{banned from}} keeping men under arms, also {{maintains}} its own military force. As a loophole to the ban, these {{are made up}} of Adepta Sororitas, more commonly known as the Sisters of Battle. They are a group of all-female, <b>militant</b> religious <b>orders</b> headed by an Abbess at the highest echelons and commanded on the field by Canonesses. They utilize weapons and power armor similar to that of space marines, though they are not genetically modified as their strict tenets forbid biological enhancements.|$|R

After dispatching Joram and Rhys to retrieve Cinhil, Camber and his daughter, Evaine, meet with the Michaelines, a <b>militant</b> religious <b>order</b> who has agreed to provide military support for the upcoming coup attempt. Soon thereafter, Imre's suspicions grow to include the entire MacRorie family, and he soon orders their arrest. However, the MacRories manage to escape capture, and the entire Michaeline order goes into hiding to elude Imre's wrath.|$|R
5000|$|Wierix {{worked on}} some of the {{important}} publications of the late 16th century. This includes a commission by the Jesuits and other <b>militant</b> Counter-Reformation <b>orders</b> on Catholic materials. His prints played an important propagandistic role in the Catholic Church's recovery of the southern Netherlands. [...] Another important publication he worked on was the set of 23 engraved portraits of artists from the Low Countries authored by Dominicus Lampsonius and published in 1572 under the title Pictorum aliquot celebrium Germaniae inferioris effigies (literal translation: Effigies of some celebrated painters of Lower Germany).|$|R
50|$|Gijsen {{was born}} in 1899 in Antwerp, Belgium. In his youth he {{received}} a strict Roman Catholic education, at the Jesuit college of Saint Ignacio in Antwerp, but in 1917 he was punished heavily (consilium abeundi, E: 'advice to leave') for his <b>militant</b> <b>Flemish</b> activism during World War I. In 1925 {{he went to the}} Catholic University of Leuven, where he obtained a PhD in history and moral sciences with a dissertation on Études sur les colonies marchandes méridionales (portugaises, espagnoles, italiennes) à Anvers de 1488 à 1567. He went on to study at the University of Freiburg, Paris (Sorbonne) and London (London School of Economics).|$|R
5000|$|The most <b>militant</b> <b>Flemish</b> {{regional}} {{party in}} Parliament in the 1950s and 1960s, the Volksunie (People's Union), once drew nearly one-quarter of Belgium's Dutch-speaking electorate.

However, in recent elections the party has suffered severe setbacks. In October 2001 the party disintegrated. The left-liberal wing founded Spirit, later called the Social Liberal Party, while the more traditional Flemish nationalist wing continued under the banner Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie (N-VA).

50|$|Festil's great-great-grandson, King Imre, {{ascended to}} the throne of Gwynedd in 900. Imre's arrogance and cruelty to his human {{subjects}} resulted in {{a great deal of}} antagonism toward the king, much of which had been slowly building since the last Haldane king was deposed. Ironically, it was a Deryni noble, Earl Camber MacRorie of Culdi, who eventually rose up to challenge Imre. After discovering the existence of a Haldane heir in 903, Camber gathered the support of the <b>militant</b> Michaeline <b>order</b> and launched a lightning attack on the royal palace. On December 2, 904, Imre was deposed, and Cinhil Haldane, the great-grandson of King Ifor Haldane, assumed the throne.|$|R
50|$|The Church pre-dates the {{founding}} of the Kingdom of Gwynedd, and the large role of the Church in Gwyneddan culture often results in the church's involvement in secular affairs.

In 820, the late King Bearand Haldane was formally canonized as a saint, and military support for the Haldane Restoration of 904 was provided by Michaeline knights, a <b>militant</b> religious <b>order.</b> A royal Haldane prince, Jashan Haldane, was even elected Archbishop of Valoret and Primate of All Gwynedd in 1044.|$|R
