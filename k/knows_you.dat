2500|$|... "Nobody <b>Knows</b> <b>You</b> When You're Down and Out" [...] is a blues {{standard}} {{written by}} Jimmy Cox in 1923. Its lyric, told {{from the point}} of view of a one-time millionaire during the Prohibition era, reflects on the fleeting nature of material wealth and the friendships that come and go with it. As a vaudeville-style blues, it was popularized by Bessie Smith, the preeminent female blues singer of the 1920s and 1930s. Since her 1929 recording, it has been interpreted by numerous musicians in a variety of styles.|$|E

Still in San Francisco in 1964, Joplin and future Jefferson Airplane guitarist Jorma Kaukonen recorded a number of blues standards, which incidentally featured Kaukonen's wife Margareta using a typewriter in the background.

2500|$|When {{he was an}} art {{student in}} the early 1960s, Eric Clapton was {{attracted}} to London's folk-music scene and the fingerpicking acoustic guitar-style of Big Bill Broonzy.

In 1970, he recorded a group version with his band, Derek and the Dominos, for their debut album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. The recording took place at the Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, with Jim Gordon (drums), Carl Radle (bass), Bobby Whitlock (organ), and Duane Allman (slide guitar). As Whitlock recalled, Sam Samudio, who was also recording at Criteria, suggested that they record the song.|$|E
