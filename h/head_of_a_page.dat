40|$|Signatures: a-z⁴, A-F⁴. Emblems {{engraved}} by Pierre Woeiriot. His mark (cross of Lorraine) {{has been}} removed from the plates, in some cases imperfectly, but his monogram remains on the first. Port. of the author appears on b 4 r, dated in the plate 1567. It is unsigned, but stylistically consonant with the emblems. Emblems appear on rectos, c 1 -D 4, and incorporate Latin mottoes on ornamental scrolls. Beneath them are four lines of explanatory Latin verse summarizing the eight lines of French verse that appear on facing versos. The 2 nd ed., following Jean Marcorelle's Lyon ed. of 1571. It is noted in VD 16 that the present ed. was printed for Froschauer by Marcorelle in Lyon. VD 16 Landwehr, J. German emblem books,Mode of access: Internet. Eleven of the other interpolated leaves bear inscriptions, all in the same hand, which differs from that of Johannes Pulmer. They consist of the date 1592 at the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the <b>page,</b> <b>a</b> brief saying or series of initials immediately below it, and a personal name at the foot. Most of the page is thus left blank, perhaps to allow for coats of arms to be added. Two modern sheets of paper are inserted in the Getty copy, on which the inscriptions have been transcribed in pencil; one of the sheets also has a brief note on 16 th-century French history, written in black ink. The arms facing no. 67, a blue fleur-de-lys on gold ground, are not identified by inscription. Siebmacher places a Stephen Mielich with these arms at Augsburg precisely in 1592 (Grosses und allgemeines Wappenbuch v. 5, pt. 1, p. 53). Stephen Mielich bore a slightly different crest, however (the blue fleur-de-lys with wings rather than with elephants' trunks, as here), and may have been another member of the family. Getty copy interleaved with a blank facing each emblem, apparently to serve as an album amicorum. Landwehr notes that the polyglot Frankfurt ed. of 1619 had blanks {{at the end of each}} emblem for this purpose (Landwehr, 445). The blank pages facing emblem nos. 67 and 100 are illuminated with coats of arms in color and gold (and the facing emblems are colored as well). The arms facing no. 100 are followed by a 7 -line inscription: "Joan. Pullamer Bibracensis, artium & Medicinae Doctor, Doctor pro tempore Medicus Bambergensis Aulicus [...] . ", dated 1592 on St. Andrew's day. The arms correspond to those of the Pulmer family in Siebmacher's Grosses und allgemeines Wappenbuch (v. 5, pt. 4, p. 33 and plate 39), where it is noted that the family was established in Biberach from the 16 th century.
