40|$|Recent ethnographic {{fieldwork}} in the Canadian Arctic has revealed {{differences in the}} patterns of <b>housekeeping</b> <b>practiced</b> by Inuit and Euro-Canadian families. These differences {{are reflected in the}} types of activities Inuit families carry out, and how these activities are distributed within houses. The majority of Inuit family activities occur in integrated spaces such as living rooms and kitchens, because daily activities provide an important context for social interaction among family members. The use of space syntax analysis to examine houses built over the past 50 years in the Canadian north indicates a trend towards floor plans with narrow view fields and a greater number of smaller rooms. This trend reflects the increasing importance of individualism and privacy in Euro-Canadian society, and is not compatible with the more collective forms of social interaction that characterize Inuit families. These results should be of importance to architects and planners interested in designing and building houses that better reflect the cultural values and lifestyles of Inuit families...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{food safety}} among {{consumers}} has various dimensions. Due {{to a number of}} food-related incidents and reported outbreaks worldwide, consumer confidence has begun to vacillate. The objective of this quantitative survey (n = 1030) was to determine Slovenian consumersć food safety knowledge and practices during purchase, transportation and storage of food, as well as foodhandling practices at home. The study highlighted gaps in food safety knowledge and some critical safety violations regarding food handling at home. Half of the respondents never thought of using a cooling bag for the transport of refrigerated or frozen foods. Approximately half of the respondents defrost meat on working surfaces and only one-third wash knives and cutting boards with hot water and detergent before re-use or use clean implements. Forty-four percent of respondents did not know the correct refrigerator temperature for the storage of perishable food. All other determinations concerning food safety knowledge and practices are presented and discussed. Consumer education should be the focus in order to reduce foodborne diseases.

50|$|On {{the night}} of 8-9 August 1942 the Japanese counterattacked near Guadalcanal in the Battle of Savo Island with a cruiser-destroyer force. In a {{controversial}} move, the US carrier task forces were withdrawn from the area on the 8th due to heavy fighter losses and low fuel. The Allied force included six heavy cruisers (two Australian), two light cruisers (one Australian), and eight US destroyers. Of the cruisers, only the Australian ships had torpedoes. The Japanese force included five heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and one destroyer. Numerous circumstances combined to reduce Allied readiness for the battle. The results of the battle were three American heavy cruisers sunk by torpedoes and gunfire, one Australian heavy cruiser disabled by gunfire and scuttled, one heavy cruiser damaged, and two US destroyers damaged. The Japanese had three cruisers lightly damaged. This was the most lopsided outcome of the surface actions in the Solomon Islands. Along with their superior torpedoes, the opening Japanese gunfire was accurate and very damaging. Subsequent analysis showed {{that some of the}} damage was due to poor <b>housekeeping</b> <b>practices</b> by US forces. Stowage of boats and aircraft in midships hangars with full gas tanks contributed to fires, along with full and unprotected ready-service ammunition lockers for the open-mount secondary armament. These practices were soon corrected, and US cruisers with similar damage sank less often thereafter. It should be noted that Savo was the first surface action of the war for almost all the US ships and personnel; few US cruisers and destroyers were targeted or hit at Coral Sea or Midway.|$|E

40|$|Background: Injuries {{resulting}} from manual handling tasks represent an on-going problem for many industries. In Australia, muscular stress due to manual handling {{is the most}} common cause of serious workers compensation claims (2010 - 11 data; Safe Work Australia, 2013). Organisations commonly use health and safety information and training to mitigate the risks posed by manual handling tasks in the workplace. However, the evidence indicates that such training is largely ineffective in reducing back pain and back injury (Clemes et al., 2009). Aims: This study applied a systems theory-based approach, Rasmussen’s Risk Management Framework, to investigate the factors infl uencing safety during manual handling activities in an air freight handling organisation. Methods: The study was conducted at an Australian air freight company. Observations of manual handling activities, cognitive decision method interviews with workers (n = 27) and interviews with managers (n = 35) were used to gather information about three manual handling activities. Hierarchical task analysis and thematic analysis were then used to identify potential risk factors and performance shaping factors across the levels of Rasmussen’s framework. Research findings: The analysis showed that there is complex system of factors impacting on safety during manual handling activities in this context, most of which are outside of the individual worker’s control. In particular, issues were identified with: staff levels, the workspace layout, the labelling of packaging, lack of rotation through tasks, <b>housekeeping,</b> traffic management <b>practices,</b> and time pressure due to manager’s KPIs. The findings demonstrate why manual handling training does not work: policy-orientated, rather than worker-orientated, changes are required to prevent future manual handling injuries...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: p. 92 - 95. Electricity tariffs are {{generally}} high in African countries, but a significant share {{of it is}} due to inefficiencies in power generation and supply. This work looked at {{a case study of}} the Sierra Leone national utility's power generation {{and its impact on the}} tariff system. Sierra Leone is a relatively small country along the west coast of Africa. It is one of the least developed countries in the world, but its electricity tariffs are one of highest in Africa. This is largely due to its inefficient power generation. A significant energy input is wasted and there are high energy output losses in the system. About 10 % of the energy input is lost because of poor <b>housekeeping</b> and operating <b>practices.</b> On the average 6 % of the power generated is consumed by the plant auxiliaries and the station due to old and inefficient equipment. The technical and non-technical losses of the system are alarmingly high averaging about 38 % in recent years. Normally, the level of electricity rates is based on revenue requirement, which depends on the operating cost. The average electricity price in Sierra Leone in 2002 was about US$ 0. 18. This high tariff is due to cost associated with the above inefficiencies, which increases the operating costs and the type and age of the generating plants. Besides, on the average there is a net decline on the generation output while operating expenses continue to increase. Using the rate-of-return methodology the tariffs were found to be well below the existing utility tariffs if the fuel is imported from the OECD countries...|$|R

40|$|Safety climate {{researchers}} {{include both}} general and contextualized {{items in the}}ir safety climate measures. However, the relative value of including contextualized items in the prediction of safety outcomes is an empirical question {{that has not been}} rigorously tested. Theories about language comprehension and ambiguity indicate that context facilitates meaning. Additionally, memory theories and corresponding empirical research indicates that context facilitates recall. By excluding contextual information, general safety climate measures might provide a comparatively deficient assessment of the underlying construct as indicated by weaker relationships with various safety-related constructs (e. g., safety knowledge, injuries, etc.). In the current study, 757 university laboratory personnel completed a contextualized safety climate measure (i. e., chemical, biological, animal, or human subjects/office research laboratory), a general safety climate measure, and measures of a number of other safety-related constructs. In addition, because some safety climate dimensions appear more conducive to specificity (e. g., safety equipment & <b>housekeeping,</b> co-worker safety <b>practices,</b> and safety training) than others (e. g., management commitment to safety), item level analyses were also conducted. Hypotheses were tested by contrasting the contextualized vs. the general safety climate correlations with various safety outcomes. Only the contextualized human subjects/office laboratory measure was consistently more strongly related to the predictors than the general safety climate measure. The results suggest that contextualized information might facilitate comprehension and recall for individuals who work in less (rather than more) safety-salient contexts. Item-level analyses indicate that contextualization for the rewards safety climate dimension is particularly helpful. The results of this study provide a rigorous test of contextualized measure effectiveness; however, further research is warranted to explicitly test the underlying theory and boundary conditions under which contextual information is beneficial...|$|R

40|$|Discussing Sweeping the German Nation: Domesticity and National Identity in Germany, 1870 – 1945 (Cambridge University Press, 2006) by Nancy Reagin, PhD, Professor of History, and Chair of the Department of Women’s and Gender StudiesI {{chose this}} topic so I could explore the gendered aspects of German {{nationalism}}. When I began my research, nationalism {{was seen as}} a largely masculine phenomenon, and women’s historians tended to ignore it. It was usually only discussed in terms of its more extreme or vivid manifestations: political organizations that seek independence for an ethnic group, or paramilitary groups. In such older narratives, the nation itself was presented as a work of men: its origin was told as a story of war, conquest, or revolution. But I felt that nationalism can also be expressed in the more everyday forms that help to create and sustain national identity: the shared rituals, values, symbols, and assumptions that bind people together as a nation. And that sort of banal, everyday nationalism was particularly important in Germany, which was a late-forming nation. Germany’s borders and forms of government have fluctuated regularly since its creation in 1871 : not all German speakers (then or now) live inside those boundaries. Germans struggled for decades about how to define or understand {{what it meant to be}} German, and who could or should be included in their national community; the fact that “Germanness” was still not a well-defined term left room for many nationalists and racists, like the Nazis, to try to define the national group in exclusionary terms. I wanted to examine the role that women played in creating and sustaining German national identity and nationalism. The domestic aspects of Germanness were what really fascinated me; I’d lived in Germany for years and had noticed that lifestyle and household were important in the popular understanding of what it meant to be German (this is reflected, for example, in many popular sayings). So, I looked at records of home economics courses, housewives’ groups, and women’s magazines and memoirs to trace how the ideal of the “German” housewife and domestic practices became interwoven with Germans’ national identity before World War I. I was also interested in the role that this ideal played in German imperialism, so I looked at the records of colonial German households in German Southwest Africa before 1914. After 1918, these understandings of German domesticity were increasingly incorporated into public policy, and I did research on various Weimar government agencies to see how they tried to support and enforce a certain style of housekeeping as being inherently “German. ” I also examined records of Nazi women’s groups and Nazi social welfare agencies to see how this domestic ideal of national identity was racialized after 1933. It underlay the <b>housekeeping</b> and consumption <b>practices</b> urged on German women (and implemented in occupied Poland) by Nazi women’s organizations. So in the end, this project took me much further than I’d originally planned (in a chronological sense). But it was fascinating to examine how household management and lifestyle became central to Germans’ sense of who they were, as a people. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) Program {{received}} {{a request from}} a mail order pharmacy. Employees were concerned about possible health effects from exposures to hazardous drugs and pharmaceutical dust, and communication and other workplace safety climate issues. Roughly 175 employees worked at the pharmacy; the majority of whom were contractors performing most production functions (e. g., filling, labeling, packaging, and housekeeping). On average, the mail order pharmacy filled approximately 74, 000 prescriptions per day using automated and manual distribution systems. HHE Program investigators evaluated the pharmacy in August 2012. We surveyed employees and talked with them about job stress, work-related health concerns, and perceptions of the job and social factors at work. We sampled air and work surfaces for lactose (inactive ingredient in pharmaceuticals) and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Overall, employees had a positive perception of safety climate. However, contractor employees were not comfortable taking time off work when ill and they reported more eye, nose, throat, and skin irritation and cough associated with work than company employees. Some employees were concerned about repetitive tasks and prolonged standing. No employees reported changes in their health consistent with exposures to hazardous drugs. However, air sampling results indicated that employees who clean or repair automatic dispensing machine cells, refill automatic dispensing machine canisters, clean manually-fed automated counters with canned air, and hand-fill hazardous drug prescriptions may be exposed to airborne dust from uncoated tablets. Inhalation exposures to active pharmaceutical ingredients were mostly below manufacturers' occupational exposure limits (if a limit was available). However, an employee who cleaned and repaired Baker machine cells was exposed to airborne Lisinopril, an antihypertension medication, above the exposure limit. Some employees were exposed to multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients, the effects of which are not well understood. The surface sampling results and our observations also indicate the potential for personal clothing contamination with active pharmaceutical ingredients {{and the potential for}} take home exposure. Employees were provided vinyl gloves but no other protective clothing. Employees demonstrated good <b>housekeeping</b> and hand-washing <b>practices.</b> To address areas of concern identified in the survey and employee interviews, HHE Program investigators recommended the employer (1) create a health and safety committee, (2) stop the punitive "point system" for discouraging absences, and (3) provide seats at workstations. To address the potential for exposures to pharmaceutical dust, HHE Program investigators recommended the employer (1) substitute uncoated tablets with coated tablets when that option is available, (2) create a list of pharmaceuticals that are dusty and use this information to determine how to handle these pharmaceuticals, (3) use local exhaust ventilation hoods that are ducted outdoors for filling hazardous drug prescriptions and other tasks that could create pharmaceutical dust, (4) require employees to wear nitrile gloves as these are better suited than vinyl gloves for pharmaceutical dust and the isopropyl alcohol used to clean surfaces and equipment, and (5) provide safety glasses and long-sleeve protective clothing to employees who hand fill hazardous drug prescriptions or create pharmaceutical dust.

40|$|Only a few {{longitudinal}} studies {{exist in the}} field of operations management (Kuula & Putkiranta, 2012) and only a few studies analyze the relationships between practices and performances (Davies & Kochlar, 2002). There are two main objectives in this master thesis. First, a scientific one: finding the practices or combinations of practices leading to a particular performance in the manufacturing industry. Data used in this master thesis come from the Made in Finland study, a subpart of the Made in Europe study. Those benchmarking studies gathered information about practices implemented and performances achieved in companies and looked at the links between them. Questions of the Made in Finland study were asked three times, in 1993, 2004 and 2010, in Finnish manufacturing companies, by members of the Helsinki School of Economics and IBM consultants. The Made in Finland study is then a longitudinal one. Second, a methodological one: utilizing the qualitative comparative analysis in order to satisfy the first objective. Results, presented as simple equations, are found with the fsQCA software. This analysis, suggested by C. Ragin in 1987, combines advantages of both qualitative and quantitative methods, uses the formal rules of Boolean algebra and allows systematic comparisons of cases. Before getting any results, it was important to read articles about benchmarking, practices and performances {{in order to understand the}} theory, to examine the context of the Made in Finland study in order to know its goals and to learn the methodology of the qualitative comparative analysis in order to use the fsQCA software. Results were the following: - In 1993, a combination of good levels of the <b>practices</b> equipment layout, <b>housekeeping,</b> manufacturing strategy and vision leads to a good level of the performance employee morale. - In 2004, three combinations of good levels of the practices automation and batch sizes or automation and manufacturing strategy or training and education, batch sizes and manufacturing strategy lead to a good level of the performance production cycle time. - In 2010, two combinations of good levels of the practices automation or quality vision and shared vision, mission and goals lead to good level of the performance customer delivery commitments met. - In 1993, a combination of good levels of the <b>practices</b> <b>housekeeping,</b> maintenance and vision leads to a good level of the performance customer satisfaction. - In 2010, three combinations of good levels of the practices batch sizes and design process or information systems, housekeeping and suppliers or information systems, batch sizes and suppliers lead to a good level of the performance customer satisfaction. - In 2010, three combinations of good levels of the practices kanban, business processes and design process or kanban, business processes, quality vision and batch sizes or business processes, quality vision, batch sizes and design process lead to a good level of the performance product reliability in service. - In 1993, two practices at a good level, customer orientation or training and education, lead to a good level of the performance market share. Those results are the best obtained results not necessarily the best results, because all possible combinations of practices were not tested and methods were used to facilitate that testing process. Indeed, similar coverage and consistency values could be found with other combinations of different practices while higher ones with, even slightly, different combinations of different practices. Those results, particularly the most recent ones from 2010, could be seen as propositions of improvement for companies. However, combinations of practices leading to a particular performance can change over time. This evolution can be seen with {{longitudinal studies}} as the Made in Finland study. Practices become obsolete, basic or irrelevant or they are combined differently to lead to the performance. And, even if practices from a combination are present, the performance can be absent. Indeed, relationships between practices, adoption order and levels of implementation matter and should be investigated. Components of practices should also be further studied in order to determine their exact importance in the link between practices and performances...|$|R

This study demonstrates how cleaner production {{can be applied to the}} lead-acid battery manufacturing industry, with focus on reduction/prevention of lead wastes. Various cleaner production options are discussed in relation to their technical and environmental feasibility. The effectiveness of good <b>housekeeping</b> <b>practices,</b> changing manufacturing processes, better process control and on-site recycling of waste generated are discussed. On-site recycling of scrap plates was found to provide 49 % reduction in the quantity of lead waste generated demonstrating that cleaner production does not necessarily need extensive changes in present practices.

At these facilities, paint stripping, solvent cleaning and metal plating are the industrial processes that produce most of DOD’S hazardous wastes. In poky directives issued in 1980, DOD directed the armed Services to {{significantly reduce the}} generation of hazardous wastes. CHZM HILL was contracted by the Defense Environmental Leadership Project and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers to evaluate 42 cases of industrial process modifications attempted by the three armed services to reduce their generation of hazardous wastes. Process modifications evaluated included resource recovery and recycling, source separation, raw material conservation, material substitution, improved <b>housekeeping</b> <b>practices</b> {{and the development of}} innovative manufacturing techniques...|$|E

40|$|First and foremost, {{the authors}} would like to {{acknowledge}} the invaluable assistance of members of the California Film Extruders and Converters Association, and the Society of the Plastics Industry, who collaborated with project personnel and drafted, on their joint letterhead, an introductory letter urging plastic industries selected by the project to cooperate with our sampling strategy. Without this support it is unlikely that 80 % of the businesses contacted on a surprise first time sample visit would have agreed to participate in our assessment of voluntary measures aimed at curbing discharges from their facilities. Not only were we given permission to enter private property and take samples and photographs, we were also permitted to interview production management personnel and determine their current <b>housekeeping</b> <b>practices,</b> and subsequently to deliver to them recommendations on improving these practices based on site walkthroughs and our baseline case study monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Industrial wastes {{consist of}} unused {{resources}} in the production process, which create costs and no added value. Measuring input-output material flows at a company level is therefore crucial for waste prevention, which is a key path towards higher resources productivity. Waste prevention strategies focus in particular on reducing or eliminating undesired waste streams, and managing by-products within the production process, rather than treatment and disposal approaches. In the long run, prevention strategies are more cost-effective and environmentally sound than conventional pollution control approaches. Waste prevention strategies apply to any manufacturing process and range from relatively easy operational changes and good <b>housekeeping</b> <b>practices</b> to more extensive changes such as replacing input materials, fine tuning or replacing equipment, or even making use of state-of-art technology. This paper provides insights on the development and testing of a toolbox for the inventory and management of waste flows looking forward to implementing a ‘zero waste ’ strategy. Twelve case studies selected within seven Portuguese industrial branches were explored. Th...|$|E
