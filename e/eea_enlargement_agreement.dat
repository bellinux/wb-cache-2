40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{attention}} is currently being paid to the discussion of the reform of global agricultural trade. In this paper, the effects of the revised Harbinson paper (March 2003) are analysed with an extensively extended GTAP model. With the help of a base run, projections are implemented in the form of economic developments as well as already enacted EU policy reforms and measures (Agenda 2000, Mid-Term Review, EU <b>enlargement,</b> EBA <b>agreement)</b> from 1997 to 2014. The base run is compared with a scenario simulating the Doha Round of the WTO based on the revised draft of the Harbinson proposal. The difference between the base run and the model scenario provides information on the effects on EU trade and budget. The revised Harbinson paper leads to a particularly negative development in the trade balances and production quantities for the agricultural and food sectors of the EU- 27, which are supported with high import duties, export subsidies and direct payments. Significant effects could be seen particularly in the cases processed food, beef, fruits and vegetables, other cereals and oils and fats. A decomposition of the total effects of the implementation of the Harbinson paper provides detailed insights in the effects resulting from the changes in the complex protection structure of the CAP. The implementation of the Doha Round of the WTO negotiations leads to a reduction in expenses for agricultural market policy of the CAP, caused especially by the production related reduction in direct payments and the complete dismantling of export subsidies.

This paper analysis the effects of different market access option {{on the basis of}} general equilibrium model. An extended version of the GTAP model is used to firstly project a base run including the Agenda 2000, the EU <b>enlargement,</b> the EBA <b>agreement</b> and the MTR.

In the third experiment, the tariff cuts are based on the Swiss Formula using a coefficient of 33 instead of the tiered approach of HARBINSON. Based on the experiments, it can be shown that world wide the high protected sectors experiences severe losses relative to the application of the HARBINSON 1 ½ approach. The comparison also shows that the highly protected beef and other processed food products sectors of the EU are particularly affected by the Swiss Formula. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} ductile plate {{perforation}} by sharp-nosed rigid projectiles is further {{examined in this}} work through 2 D numerical simulations. We highlight various features concerning the effective resisting stress (σr) which a finite thickness plate, with a flow stress of Yt, exerts on the projectile during perforation. In particular, we show that the normalized resisting stress (σr/Yt) can be represented as a unique function of the normalized thickness of the plate (H/D, where H is plate thickness and D is projectile diameter), for a large range of normalized thicknesses. Our simulations for very thin target plates show that the penetration process is achieved through the well-known dishing mechanism, where the target material is pushed forward by the projectile’s nose. An important observation, which emerges from our simulations, is that the transition between the dishing and the hole enlargement mechanisms takes place at a normalized thickness of about H/D= 1 / 3. We also find that the normalized resistive stress for intermediate plate thicknesses, 1 / 3 1) the σr/Yt ratio increases monotonically to values which represent the resistance to penetration of semi-infinite targets, where the stress state is characterized by plane strain conditions. Using a simple model, {{which is based on}} energy conservation, we can predict the values of the ballistic limit velocities for many projectile/target combinations, provided the perforation is done through the ductile hole <b>enlargement</b> mechanism. Good <b>agreement</b> is demonstrated between predictions from our model and experimental data from different sources, strongly enhancing the confidence in both the validity and usefulness of our model...|$|R
40|$|The WTO {{agricultural}} negotiations of the Doha round are a {{key issue}} in the public debate. This paper analyses the effects of different options to improve market-access {{on the basis of}} a GTAP model, comparing the impact of the Harbinson proposal and the Swiss formula on trade balances. An extended version of the GTAP model is used to first project a base run that includes factors arising from Agenda 2000, EU <b>enlargement,</b> the EBA <b>agreement</b> and the EU’s mid-term review. The policy simulation run additionally includes the WTO negotiations. Here, the model is differentiated between three experiments. While the first experiment simply implements the Harbinson proposal, the second one additionally takes into account an adoption of the EBA agreement by all industrialised countries. In the third experiment, the tariff cuts are based on the Swiss formula using a coefficient of 33 instead of the tiered approach of the Harbinson proposal. After comparing the results of the three experiments, the paper concludes that the results from the different options for improving market access show parallel developments, with more- or less-pronounced increases or decreases in trade balances. Implementation of the Harbinson approach results in negative changes in the EU’s trade balances for most agricultural products, except for the sugar, milk and other animal products sectors. The application of the Swiss formula to cut tariffs predictably results in severe losses to highly protected sectors worldwide in comparison to the Harbinson approach. In the EU, the highly protected sectors of beef and other processed food products would be particularly affected...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is the {{analysis}} of fishery products exchange between the EU and its Mediterranean partners. In order to delineate more clearly the framework of trade in fish products among the Mediterranean countries, EU and non-EU members, countries under analysis (only those with a Mediterranean shore) will be divided into 4 groups:  PMM, EU Mediterranean members (France, Greece, Italy, Spain, Cyprus, Malta and Slovenia);  PCM, candidate Mediterranean countries (Croatia and Turkey);  PPCM, potential candidate Mediterranean countries (Albania and Montenegro);  PTM, third Mediterranean countries (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Syria, Palestinian Authority and Tunisia). In addition to the more recent political <b>agreements</b> (<b>enlargement</b> processes and membership) the analysis will take into account the partnership processes involving the EU, on one hand, and some Mediterranean partners: the Euro - Mediterranean partnership (PEM) and the Stabilization and Association process (PSA) that the EU has launched with the countries of the Mediterranean south-east (from North Africa to the Middle-East) in the first case, and with the countries of south-eastern Europe (Balkans), in the second case. The study focuses on the fishery products exchange using, as sources, UN-Comtrade data (for the international trade) and Eurostat data (for the EU trade). The analysis will pay attention both on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of trade. From the analysis it is expected to identify the main trends of exchange, the effects of the liberalisation processes on the fish products exchange and any product specialisation.

40|$|In the {{relationship}} between the European Union and the EFTA States nearly all attention has recently been drawn to the enlargement negotiations of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria, which were recently successfully concluded. However, it should not be forgotten that the accession of the abovementioned EFTA States still depends on the outcome of their respective referenda relating to the <b>enlargement</b> issue. The <b>agreement</b> establishing the European Economic Area (EEA), which entered into force on 1 January 1994, is at present the zenith of cooperation between the European Union and the EFTA States and the EEA Agreement could remain of importance if the outcome of the referenda in {{one or more of the}} EFTA States is negative. It should be mentioned that, besides Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria, Iceland is also among the EFTA States which are party to the EEA Agreement. Liechtenstein has postponed its ratification due to its close relations with Switzerland which was unable to ratify following its referendum in 1992. The EEA Agreement deserves further attention due to the possibility that it may serve as a model for the European Union in later negotiations with other countries, especially with Eastern European countries which most likely will not be able to accede as full members for some years to come but may like to be associated with the Community within a multilateral and institutionalized framework.

40|$|Assessment of {{the left}} atrial (LA) size is crucial in cats with cardiomyopathies because LA dilation, which results from an {{increased}} diastolic filling pressure, predisposes towards the development {{of congestive heart failure}} and arterial thromboembolism. In addition, LA dilation {{has been shown to be}} a negative prognostic factor in cats affected by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the agreement between M-mode and two-dimensional (2 D) echocardiography in the assessment of LA size in cats. The study was retrospective and observational. Cats with and without heart diseases were included. The LA and aorta (AO) were measured in M-mode and 2 D using a standard right parasternal short axis view at the aortic valve level. A left atrium to aorta ratio (LA/AO) > 1. 5 was considered indicative of LA <b>enlargement.</b> Cohen’s kappa <b>agreement</b> was calculated and Bland- Altman plots were obtained. A total of 188 client-owned cats were included: 104 with heart disease and 84 without heart disease. LA and AO dimensions in M-mode were 13. 9 +/- 3. 7 mm and 8. 7 +/- 1. 5 mm, respectively, and in 2 D were 14. 1 +/- 3. 5 mm and 8. 8 +/- 1. 4 mm, respectively. Bland-Altman plots showed that the mean difference for the evaluation of AO dimensions between 2 D and M-mode was 0. 1 +/- 1. 0 mm and that of LA was 0. 1 +/- 1. 4 mm.

40|$|Agriculture {{is a vital}} element {{not only}} in the rural economy but also in the wider {{national}} economy of Greece. Greece's agriculture occupies the first place in terms of its share in GDP, population and balance of trade among the old member states of the European Union (EU- 15). Specifically, Greece's agriculture contributes in terms of GDP, the active population and its value exports 6, 16 and 23 percent respectively against 2, 4 and 8 percent at an average level in the EU. The accession of Greece into the European Community in 1981 resulted in the immediate implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the gradual (within 5 years) removal of tariffs on the trade of agricultural products with other member countries. Consequently, the institutional framework within which Greek agriculture had developed in the post-war period changed radically and the regulating ability of the Greek state was significantly limited (Maraveyias, 1994). The question which we will try to answer in this paper is, to what degree the change in the institutional framework of the development of Greek agriculture, due to the implementation of the CAP 1 and the freeing of trade in agricultural products within the Community, affected Greek agriculture. Specifically, after a short review of agricultural policy in Greece before accession and the changes made during the transition period, an attempt is made in this paper to assess quantitatively and qualitatively developments in key indicators of Greek agriculture. Moreover, the agricultural sector's prospects are examined after the 1992 CAP reform for important for our country products, the implementation of the Uruguay Agreement, the Berlin <b>Agreement,</b> <b>enlargement</b> of the EU, the Mid-Term CAP reform and the recent developments in the CAP and its prospects.

40|$|Introduction]. When the Belgian Presidency of the European Union {{set off on}} 1 July 2001, {{expectations}} ran high. The Belgian Presidency {{was expected}} to put the European train back on the rails, since the European integration process was clearly in a slump. Various factors have contributed to this general malaise about the way Europe was run. To begin with, the Nice summit had aroused mixed feelings. Although the Treaty of Nice prepared the Union for <b>enlargement</b> mathematically – <b>agreements</b> on vote weighting in the Council, the number {{of members of the}} European Parliament etc. – many people seriously doubted whether a Europe consisting of 27 or 28 member states would be able to operate effectively. More in general, some people wonder whether a larger Europe will not automatically become a ‘watered down’ Europe. Several other factors have contributed to this scepticism. The European elections of 1999 were far from a success in terms of turnout, whilst public opinion expressed its negative attitude towards the European project in two referendums {{during the first half of}} 2001 : the Danes said ‘nej’ to the euro and the Irish said ‘no’ to the Treaty of Nice. In addition, the Swedish Presidency ended in a minor key in June 2001 : in spite of the ambitions of the Göteborg summit, where sustainable development was to be placed high on the European agenda, only the violent street protest actions will be remembered. Once it had become clear that the negotiations in Nice were not going to cause a dramatic change in attitude, Belgium’s prime minister Guy Verhofstadt suggested that the Belgian Presidency should be concluded with a ‘Declaration of Laeken’ that was to give the debate on the future of Europe a new impetus. The Belgian Presidency therefore came at a crucial moment for the Union: on the one hand, Europe was generally held in low esteem, but on the other hand, a debate on Europe’s future might change this negative attitude and rekindle enthusiasm through an ambitious project. And the Belgian Presidency was ambitious. This appeared during the presentation of the Belgian ‘priority programme’: on 2 May, when the Swedish Presidency was still in full swing, the Belgian prime minister presented a programme containing sixteen priorities. The present paper examines the outcome of the Belgian presidency and how it (possibly) helped to shape the future of Europe. The first part briefly describes the general context of the presidency, covering the tasks of the presiding member state and the potential influence of the presidency on the European agenda. The second part assesses the performance of the Belgian Presidency and evaluates the extent to which the Belgian priorities were achieved in various areas. An evaluation of the achievements of the Union in a wide range of areas can identify future needs and challenges. Some of these issues were integrated into the Declaration of Laeken in one form or another. We will next examine the Declaration of Laeken and the debate on the future of Europe in greater detail. The final part of this paper describes the agenda after Laeken...|$|R
