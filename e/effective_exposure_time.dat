50|$|A {{focal-plane shutter}} is {{positioned}} {{just in front}} of the film, in the focal plane, and moves an aperture across the film until the full frame has been exposed.Focal-plane shutters are usually implemented as a pair of light-tight cloth, metal, or plastic curtains. For shutter speeds slower than a certain point (known as the X-sync speed of the shutter), which depends on the camera, one curtain of the shutter opens, and the other closes after the correct exposure time. At shutter speeds faster than the X-sync speed, the top curtain of the shutter travels across the focal plane, with the second curtain following behind, effectively moving a slit across the focal plane until each part of the film or sensor has been exposed for the correct time. The <b>effective</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>time</b> can be much shorter than for central shutters, at the cost of some distortion of fast-moving subjects.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, depth cameras gained {{increasing}} {{acceptance in}} the areas of robotics and autonomous systems. However, on mobile platforms depth measurements with continuous wave amplitude modula-tion Time-of-Flight cameras suffer from motion artifacts, since multiple acquisitions are required in order to compute one depth map (resulting in longer <b>effective</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>times).</b> Some lenses of different manufacturers include image stabilizers, but they are only able to compensate for small image shifts. Moreover, when performing a phase unwrapping based on the acquisition of multiple depth maps with different modulation frequen-cies, the motion artifacts are significantly more severe. In this paper, a method to compensate camera motions during the acquisition of a single depth map as well as for multiple depth maps is presented. Image shifts are estimated firstly and after normalization the individual phase images are shifted accordingly. The proposed approach is evaluated on different scenes and it is able to facilitate ToF imaging on mobile platforms...|$|R

The EUVE satellite spectrometers observed the prototype eclipsing binary Algol over nearly 1. 5 orbital periods. <b>Effective</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>times</b> were 100 ksec and 89 ksec in the short wave (70 - 180 A) and medium wave (140 - 370 A) channels. High temperature (up to 20 MK) Fe XVI-XXIV emission lines are clearly detected in the overall spectrum. In addition, a quiescent continuum is present which increases towards shorter wavelengths. Using synthesized spectra of optically thin line and continuum emission folded through the instrumental response, we have examined constraints on the (Fe/H) coronal abundance in Algol. We find that the coronal Fe is underabundant by factors that approximately equal 2 - 4 relative to solar photospheric values, unless an unreasonably large quantity of coronal plasma at T greater than 30 MK {{is present in the}} quiescent spectrum. The latter possibility is, however, inconsistent with available X-ray data. Lightcurves of the high temperature EUV lines compared to line emission at He II 304 A show considerable differences, with much deeper minima present in the He II line during both primary and secondary eclipses. Toward the end of the observation a moderate flare lasting approximately 6 hours was detected in the high temperature Fe emission lines.

We detect significant (〉 3. 7 σ) X-ray emission from massive galaxies at z ≈ 4. We also report the detection of massive galaxies at z ≈ 5 at a 99. 7 per cent confidence level (2. 7 σ), the highest significance ever obtained for X-ray emission from galaxies at such high redshifts. No significant signal is detected from galaxies at even higher redshifts. The stacking results place constraints on the BHAD associated with the known high-redshift galaxy samples, {{as well as on}} the SFRD at high redshift, assuming a range of prescriptions for X-ray emission due to X- ray binaries. We find that the X-ray emission from our sample is likely dominated by processes related to star formation. Our results show that low-rate mass accretion on to SMBHs in individually X-ray-undetected galaxies is negligible, compared with the BHAD measured for samples of X-ray detected AGN, for cosmic SMBH mass assembly at high redshift. We also place, for the first time, constraints on the faint-end of the AGN X-ray luminosity function (logLX ̃ 42) at z 〉 4, with evidence for fairly flat slopes. The implications of all of these findings are discussed in the context of the evolution of the AGN population at high redshift...|$|R
40|$|We {{present results}} from a 479. 7 ks Chandra {{exposure}} of the Hubble Deep Field North (HDF-N) and its immediate vicinity. In our X-ray image, the deepest ever reported with a 0. 5 - 2. 0 keV flux limit of about 4. 9 x 10 ^- 17 erg/cm^ 2 /s, we detect four new HDF-N X-ray sources bringing {{the total number of}} such sources to 12. The new sources include two optically bright (R= 18. 3 - 18. 8), low-redshift (z< 0. 15) galaxies, a Fanaroff-Riley I radio galaxy, and an edge-on spiral hosting either a powerful starburst or a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). Notably, we have now detected X-ray emission from all luminous galaxies (M_V<- 18) with z< 0. 15 known in the HDF-N. We have also detected the remarkable microJy radio source VLA J 123642. 09 + 621331. 4, which is located just outside the HDF-N and has a likely redshift of z= 4. 424. We have detected X-ray variability from two of the previously known HDF-N X-ray sources, and spectral fitting shows clear evidence for X-ray absorption in the brightest X-ray source in the HDF-N, a z= 0. 960 broad-line AGN with associated Mg II absorption. Stacking analyses of optically bright HDF-N galaxies not individually detected in X-rays have provided estimates of their average X-ray fluxes, and we find that the X-ray luminosities of `normal' spirals at z 0. 5 are not more than a factor of 2 ̃ larger (per unit B-band luminosity) than those of spirals in the local Universe (z< 0. 01). This constrains models for the evolution of low-mass X-ray binary populations in galaxies in response to the declining cosmic star-formation rate. Monte-Carlo simulations support the validity of the stacking analyses and show that the Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) performs source detection well even with <b>effective</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>times</b> of 8 Ms. (Abridged) Comment: 40 pages, AJ, in press, improved and expanded to address referee Comments, also available at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|We {{constrain}} the X-ray emission properties of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z ~ 3 - 6 using the 2 Ms Chandra Deep Field-North and 1 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South. Large samples of LBGs were discovered using HST {{as part of}} the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS). Deep optical and X-ray imaging over the GOODS fields have allowed us to place the most significant constraints on the X-ray properties of LBGs to date. Mean X-ray properties of 449, 1734, 629, and 247 LBGs with z ~ 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively, were determined using stacking techniques. When stacked, we detect X-ray emission from LBGs at z ~ 3 (7 sigma) and from an optically bright subset (brightest 25 %) of LBGs at z ~ 4 (3 sigma); the latter is the highest redshift detection yet for "normal" galaxies in the X-ray band. The <b>effective</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>times</b> for these stacked observations are 0. 7 and 0. 5 Gs, respectively. The derived average rest-frame 2. 0 - 8. 0 keV luminosities are 1. 5 and 1. 4 x 10 ^ 41 erg s^- 1, respectively. X-ray emission from these LBGs is likely due to high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and Type II supernovae; the corresponding star formation rates are 85 - 240 M_sol yr^- 1. The X-ray to B-band mean luminosity ratio (Lx/LB) at z~ 3 is somewhat elevated with respect to that measured for starburst galaxies in the local Universe. When stacking full samples of LBGs at z ~ 4, 5, and 6 we do not obtain significant detections and derive rest-frame 2. 0 - 8. 0 keV luminosity upper limits of 0. 9, 2. 8, and 7. 1 x 10 ^ 41 erg s^- 1, respectively. These upper limits constrain any widespread AGN activity in these objects to be modest at best. Furthermore, we find that ~ 0. 5 % of our LBGs from z ~ 3 - 6 are detected individually in the X-ray band. Continued [...] . Comment: 19 pages, 5 figures. AJ, in pres...|$|R
