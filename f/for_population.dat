5|$|Apart from {{originating}} {{theories on}} the entrepreneur and spatial economics, Cantillon {{also provided a}} dedicated theory on population growth. Unlike William Petty, who believed there always existed {{a considerable amount of}} unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows only {{as long as there are}} economic opportunities present. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables <b>for</b> <b>population</b> size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon's population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth, including the tendency <b>for</b> <b>population</b> growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.|$|E

30|$|Response to {{meningitis}} epidemics {{is based}} on weekly incidence thresholds at the district level (World Health Organization 2000): the alert threshold, defined as 5 cases per 100, 000 inhabitants per week <b>for</b> <b>populations</b> greater than 30, 000 inhabitants and 2 cases in one week <b>for</b> <b>populations</b> of less than 30, 000 inhabitants, is used to launch an investigation {{at the start of}} an epidemic, check epidemic preparedness, start a vaccination campaign if there is an epidemic in a neighbouring district and prioritize areas for vaccination campaigns in the course of an epidemic. The epidemic threshold, which is used to step up mass vaccination, is defined as 10 cases (or 15 cases depending on context) per 100, 000 inhabitants <b>for</b> <b>populations</b> greater than[*] 30, 000 inhabitants and 5 cases in one week <b>for</b> <b>populations</b> of less than[*] 30, 000 inhabitants. This strategy depends on timely surveillance, and rapid response, which are difficult to achieve in less-developed countries. The strategy can therefore benefit from improved surveillance and forecasting tools.|$|R
5|$|As of 2010, Canadians make up 0.5% of the world's total population, having {{relied upon}} {{immigration}} <b>for</b> <b>population</b> growth and social development.

In 1959, the London County Council negotiated 5000 new homes {{to be built in}} Ashford as overspill from London, which created most of what is now South Ashford and Kennington. The Buchanan Report, published in 1967, identified Ashford as a major town for growth. In 2001, Ashford was identified as one of four key areas for expansion in South East England. Subsequently, the Ashford's Future Company was set up to support a mix of publicly and privately funded projects in the town.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of Banksia species that has both lignotuberous and non-lignotuberous populations. In both cases, plants are adapted to release their aerial seed bank {{following}} a bushfire, ensuring seedlings are established on clear and relatively fertile ground; however the possession of a lignotuber makes plants much less reliant on fire regime <b>for</b> <b>population</b> maintenance and regeneration, as maternal plants are not killed by bushfire, but resprout from below ground level. Lignotuberous plants generally occur among the north-eastern populations, in the vicinity of Woodanilling. An investigation into the biogeography of these plants failed to find any vegetative, climatic or other environmental factors associated with the possession of a lignotuber.|$|E

5|$|Urbanization {{can result}} in the {{fragmentation}} of contiguous natural landscapes into patchy habitat within an urban area. Animals that live in these fragmented areas often have reduced movement between the habitat patches, {{which can lead to}} reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Animals such as the bobcat are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home ranges. A study in coastal Southern California has shown bobcat populations are affected by urbanization, creation of roads, and other developments. The populations may not be declining as much as predicted, but instead the connectivity of different populations is affected. This leads to a decrease in natural genetic diversity among bobcat populations. For bobcats, preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary <b>for</b> <b>population</b> viability. Educating local residents about the animals is critical, as well, for conservation in urban areas.|$|E
5|$|According to the Malaysian Department of Statistics, the country's {{population}} was 28,334,135 in 2010, {{making it the}} 42nd most populated country. According to a 2012 estimate, the population is increasing by 1.54 percent per year. Malaysia has an average population density of 96 people per km², ranking it 116th in the world <b>for</b> <b>population</b> density. People within the 15–64 age group constitute 69.5 {{percent of the total}} population; the 0–14 age group corresponds to 24.5 percent; while senior citizens aged 65 years or older make up 6.0 percent. In 1960, when the first official census was recorded in Malaysia, the {{population was}} 8.11 million. 91.8 per cent of the population are Malaysian citizens. Malaysian citizens are divided along ethnic lines, with 67.4 per cent considered bumiputera The largest group of bumiputera are Malays, who are defined in the constitution as Muslims who practice Malay customs and culture. They play a dominant role politically. Bumiputera status is also accorded to certain non-Malay indigenous peoples, including ethnic Thais, Khmers, Chams and the natives of Sabah and Sarawak. Non-Malay bumiputera make up more than half of Sarawak's population and over two thirds of Sabah's population. There also exist aboriginal groups in much smaller numbers on the peninsula, where they are collectively known as the Orang Asli. Laws over who gets bumiputera status vary between states.|$|E
5|$|Tigers once ranged widely across eastern Eurasia, {{from the}} Black Sea in the west, to the Indian Ocean in the south, and from Kolyma to Sumatra in the east. Over the past 100 years, {{they have lost}} 93% of their {{historic}} range, and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, and from large areas of Southeast, Southern, and Eastern Asia. Today, they range from the Siberian taiga to open grasslands and tropical mangrove swamps. The remaining six tiger subspecies have been classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The global population in the wild is estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 individuals, down from around 100,000 {{at the start of}} the 20th century, with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other, in which about 2,000 tigers live on the Indian subcontinent. A 2016 global census estimated the population of wild tigers at approximately 3,890 individuals. Major reasons <b>for</b> <b>population</b> decline include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. The extent of area occupied by tigers is estimated at less than , a 41% decline from the area estimated in the mid-1990s. In 2016, the WWF declared that the world's count of wild tigers has risen for the first time in a century.|$|E
