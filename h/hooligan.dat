5|$|Like many English {{football}} clubs, Aston Villa {{have had}} several <b>hooligan</b> firms associated with them: Villa Youth, Steamers, Villa Hardcore and the C-Crew, the last mentioned being very active during the 1970s and 1980s. As {{can be seen}} across the whole of English football, the <b>hooligan</b> groups have now been marginalised. In 2004, several Villa firms {{were involved in a}} fight with QPR fans outside Villa Park in which a steward died. The main groupings of supporters can now be found in a number of domestic and international supporters' clubs. This includes the Official Aston Villa Supporters Club which also has many smaller regional and international sections. There were several independent supporters clubs during the reign of Doug Ellis but most of these disbanded after his retirement. The supporter group My Old Man Said formed to stand up for Villa supporters' rights, {{as a direct result of}} Villa supporters' protest against the club's appointment of Alex McLeish. The club's supporters also publish fanzines such as Heroes and Villains and The Holy Trinity.|$|E
5|$|Rivalries {{with other}} clubs, {{as well as}} their fans' {{frustration}} at Cardiff's struggles in the 1980s, saw the emergence of a <b>hooligan</b> group within the club's fanbase that became known as the Soul Crew. The group became notorious for their violent clashes with rival supporters and have seen brawls between sets of supporters at football matches and other events.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several fanzines {{published}} by supporters. Made in Brum, first issued in 2000, {{was the only one}} regularly on sale in 2013.

The <b>hooligan</b> firm associated with the club, the Zulus, were unusual in that they had multi-racial membership {{at a time when many}} such firms had associations with racist or right-wing groups.|$|E
50|$|According to Colin Blaney in Hotshot: The Story of a Little Red Devil, many of Manchester United's {{football}} <b>hooligans</b> {{turned to}} serious crime during this period. He states that {{roughly half of}} the team's <b>hooligans</b> became involved in selling class A drugs, {{partly because of the}} wave of drugs that came with early 1990s rave culture, a scene that football <b>hooligans</b> were at the centre of.|$|R
40|$|This work ananlyzes {{behavior}} of football <b>hooligans</b> in Czech republic. We focus {{especially on the}} question why do the Czech <b>hooligans</b> involve in riots and fights more than their British counterparts. Not long ago, the British <b>hooligans</b> belonged to the most dangerous <b>hooligans</b> in Europe. We show what was behind the change of their behavior and thus caused that the stadium became {{a safe place to}} watch a football game. We try to determine whether these measures are generally applicable within the economic approach to behaviour. The practical part tries to find out how this problem is faced by the Czech Football Association and major league clubs and whether to fight this problem is for them feasible at all. In the final part. I suggest measures that could help to solve the problem with <b>hooligans...</b>|$|R
50|$|Since 2005 {{clashes between}} <b>hooligans</b> {{occurred}} mostly {{outside the city}} because of the excessive attention of police. During the Euro 2012 several leaders of football <b>hooligans</b> came under government pressure. During the Ukrainian revolution 2014 was announced about unification of all fans and imposed a ban on any provocation as burning attributes, fighting, offensive songs. During the war in eastern Ukraine many <b>hooligans</b> and ultras went {{to the defense of}} the state.|$|R

The now-disbanded group Jorvik Reds, who were primarily inspired by the continental ultras movement, were known for staging pre-match displays. The York Nomad Society is the <b>hooligan</b> firm associated with the club.|$|E
5|$|As with film, {{the rivalry}} between the clubs' <b>hooligan</b> firms has been covered in {{books such as}} Congratulations You Have Just Met the ICF by Cass Pennant, leader of the Inter City Firm. No One Likes Us, We Don't Care: True Stories from Millwall, Britain's Most Notorious Football Hooligans by Andrew Woods focuses on the fights between the two firms, from the {{perspective}} of Millwall's Bushwackers. Sunday Mirror columnist Michael Calvin spent the 2009–10 season covering Millwall, writing the book Family: Life, Death and Football. The beginning extensively features the rivalry and the stabbing of a Millwall supporter before the 2009 Upton Park riot game.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the day started early in the morning when skirmishes broke out in a bar, which led to an Arsenal fan being stabbed. Later in the day, Galatasaray fans {{occupied}} City Hall Square before heading towards Arsenal fans in bars nearby. The Galatasaray fans were later attacked from behind by members of British <b>hooligan</b> firms seeking revenge for the Istanbul stabbings. Despite deploying 2,000 officers to the area and having prior warning of potential trouble, the police were unable to control the riot until they fired tear gas at the rioters. This led to 19 injuries, including 4 stabbings, and 60 arrests with similar events occurring in England and Turkey {{in the aftermath of the}} riots.|$|E

But Mr. Picornie wanted to set an example for the young emerging <b>hooligans</b> at Ajax and attended the Battle in Beverwijk. During the fight, Picornie was separated from his group, along with H. Joos with both Ajax <b>hooligans</b> being surrounded by Feyenoord <b>Hooligans,</b> leading to their injuries and Carlo's death on the scene.|$|R
5|$|The {{match was}} marred {{by a series of}} <b>hooligan</b> {{incidents}} occurring near the stadium. It was being played the day before a Cardiff City game; a group of Cardiff City fans entered the Prince of Wales public house in the city to find it occupied by Manchester United fans staying in the city overnight. A series of running battles between fans of the two clubs followed, resulting in 22 arrests (including two boys aged just 11 and 13) as well as a man suffering stab wounds and a police officer suffering a broken arm. On the day of the game, an army of around 50 Cardiff and Liverpool hooligans were seen attacking United supporters in the Wood Street area.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} the teams is deeply {{embedded}} in British football hooliganism lore and culture, and has been depicted in films that focused specifically on the animosity between the clubs' two <b>hooligan</b> firms, the Inter City Firm and the Millwall Bushwackers. Violence has occurred sporadically between the fans, once resulting {{in the death of}} a Millwall supporter in 1976. Most recently in the 2009 Upton Park riot, widespread disorder between supporters in and around West Ham's Upton Park ground led to numerous injuries and a Millwall fan being stabbed before the match began. In the last two games between the sides in the 2011–12 season, the Metropolitan Police implemented London-wide operations to ensure the games were trouble-free.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{minutes into}} the game, a pass to the right wing by George Livingstone eluded Bolton's Archie Freebairn, and reached Meredith, who dribbled beyond Bob Struthers for a run on goal. He shot to goalkeeper Davies' left, scoring the opening goal. Reporters with Bolton sympathies, such as ex-Bolton {{secretary}} JJ Bentley, claimed the goal to be offside, though the Bolton players made no appeal to the referee. The goal led to one over-exuberant Manchester City supporter invading the pitch, and subsequently being escorted away by police, though {{in contrast to the}} modern image of the football <b>hooligan,</b> the Sporting Chronicle reported that the man was then allowed back onto the terraces, as the police had been impressed by the level of devotion that he had demonstrated.|$|E

5000|$|On 4 May 2010 Luton <b>hooligans</b> stormed {{onto the}} Kenilworth Road pitch after losing 2-0 on {{aggregate}} in the play-off semi-finals to York City. This caused the York players {{to be taken}} {{up to the top}} of the away stand for safety, and to prevent the Luton <b>hooligans</b> from being able to attack them. This did not work as the Luton <b>hooligans</b> started throwing coins, bottles and other missiles at the York players and fans. Richard Brodie, a York striker, told the police that he was hit on the head with a pound coin after he was ushered back into safety. The Luton <b>hooligans</b> did not stop in the stadium as they rioted for hours after the match through the streets of Luton.|$|R
5|$|Fixtures between Millwall and West Ham United are {{currently}} categorised by the Metropolitan Police as category C– games which carry {{a high risk}} of disorder amongst supporters. For the 2011–12 season, the Metropolitan Police implemented London-wide operations to ensure that the games passed by without any incident. In 2013 a member of West Ham's <b>hooligan</b> Inter City Firm was jailed for 12 months for organising violence between West Ham and Millwall fans during an FA Cup match between Dagenham & Redbridge and Millwall on 7 January 2012. He chose this game in the belief fewer police would be in attendance at a match in Dagenham, but who instead, turned out in force to prevent trouble. In November 2014 the two sides' development squads were drawn against each other in the U21 Premier League Cup. The Metropolitan Police took preventative measures against any trouble occurring, demanding the game at Rush Green kick-off at 12pm and be played behind closed doors.|$|E
5|$|Millwall's fiercest rival is West Ham United. It {{is one of}} {{the most}} passionately contested local derbies in football. The two clubs have rarely met in recent years due to them playing in {{different}} leagues; the majority of their meetings happened before the First World War, with some 60 meetings between 1899–1915. The clubs have played 99 times since the first contest in 1899. Millwall have won 38, drawn 27 and lost 34. Despite violence between the two sets of supporters and calls for future games between the clubs to be played behind closed doors, they last met in the Football League Championship in 2011–12 with no outright ban on either set of fans, and no repeat of crowd trouble. The rivalry between the sides, specifically the clubs' two <b>hooligan</b> firms has been depicted on the big screen several times, in films such as Green Street.|$|E
5|$|The late 1970s {{through to}} the '80s was a {{turbulent}} period for Chelsea. An ambitious redevelopment of Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club, star players were sold and the team were relegated. Further problems were caused by a notorious <b>hooligan</b> element among the support, which was to plague the club throughout the decade. In 1982, Chelsea were, at the nadir of their fortunes, acquired by Ken Bates for the nominal sum of £1, although by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers, meaning the club faced losing their home. On the pitch, the team had fared little better, coming close to relegation to the Third Division for the first time, but in 1983 manager John Neal put together an impressive new team for minimal outlay. Chelsea won the Second Division title in 1983–84 and established themselves in the top division, before being relegated again in 1988. The club bounced back immediately by winning the Second Division championship in 1988–89.|$|E
50|$|On 8 August 1986 rival {{gangs of}} Manchester United and West Ham United <b>hooligans</b> were {{involved}} in violence on a Sealink ferry bound for Amsterdam. Eight football <b>hooligans,</b> all either Manchester United or West Ham United supporters, received prison sentences totalling 51 years 16 months later. Another incident was soon forthcoming: on 20 September 1986 Leeds United <b>hooligans</b> overturned and immolated a fish and chip van at Odsal Stadium, the temporary home of Bradford City following the fire at Valley Parade the previous year.|$|R

5|$|Bremner was {{appointed}} as Leeds United manager in October 1985, having impressed the boardroom {{with his work}} at Doncaster, particularly his negotiation skills during the sale of Ian Snodin; Leeds paid Doncaster £45,000 in compensation. The club had declined during his absence; Leeds had dropped down into the Second Division, sold Elland Road to the council to raise money, and club supporters picked up a reputation for violence after regular <b>hooligan</b> riots in the stands. He quickly reinstated Don Revie's philosophy and his little traditions, for example he reinstated the sessions of carpet bowls on Friday evenings. Despite this he appointed Ian Snodin as club captain, and dropped former captain and teammate Peter Lorimer from the starting line eleven. He also moved on the young players signed by former manager and teammate Eddie Gray, choosing to sign experienced players in their place. Five key young players to leave the club were Scott Sellars (£20,000 to Blackburn Rovers), Terry Phelan (free transfer to Swansea City), Denis Irwin, Tommy Wright and Andy Linighan (all to Oldham Athletic for £60,000, £55,000 and £80,000 respectively). The money raised allowed him to buy central defender Brendan Ormsby (£65,000 from Aston Villa), and also sign David Rennie, Brian Caswell and Ronnie Robinson. Leeds struggled in the 1985–86 season, but managed to steer away from the relegation zone to finish in 14th place.|$|E
