When the {{distance}} between two opposite <b>excavation</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> too small, the explosive load of one <b>excavation</b> <b>face</b> may causes rock failure of the other <b>excavation</b> <b>face</b> and result in engineering accidents. In this paper, the dynamic response of rock pillar between two opposite <b>excavation</b> <b>faces</b> during one explosive excavation cycle is investigated. An aftereffect function is adopted to reflect the viscoelastic properties of deep rock mass, and the explicit difference scheme of stress field is derived and then implemented by Matlab programs. The transient stress field of rock pillar is computed by coupling the initial stress field and the explosive waves. The analogies between the minimal safe distance and those influence factors such as explosive excavation load, rock mechanical properties, in-situ stresses, are fulfilled by this method.

40|$|Pipe jacking {{is often}} used to install {{pipelines}} in congested urban areas or river crossings. The applied jacking force needs to be greater than the frictional resistance along the pipe and the face resistance. Lubricant slurries are usually employed to minimize the frictional resistance. Therefore, it is critical to estimate earth pressures acting on shield <b>excavation</b> <b>face</b> correctly. In this paper, the original Protodyakonov's arch model is modified to calculate the vertical pressure on deeply buried pipes. For shallow burial depth less than 5 m, the Terzaghi arching model is still applicable to estimate the vertical pressure.

In this study, the discontinuity of shield tunnel lining and {{the interaction between the}} tunnel segments, the grouting layer, and the surrounding rock are considered. Based on the 3 D nonlinear contact theory, a hybrid model of the shield tunnel is constructed. Considering the fluid-solid coupling effect of water and soil, the influences of different water head differences on the mechanical performance and deformation of segments and joints in the shield tunnel are studied. The water gushing from the <b>excavation</b> <b>face</b> leads to vertical convergence of the cross-sectional area of the shield tunnel, and joint opening and dislocation result in sharp decrease of the waterproof capacity of joints.

This paper describes the displacement monitoring results taken during tunnelling through heavily fragmented limestone varying from a block size > 10 cm down to sandy gravel and sandy silt or gouge. The primary lining displacements monitored by surveying methods appear to be directly related to the detailed geological subdivisions of the limestone observed at the tunnel face. Maximum values of settlement were recorded during tunnelling through the gouge and reached 80 mm, while horizontal movements up to 40 mm were recorded associated with outward deflection of the support frames. The development of settlement with time shows that settlement of the tunnel crown and sides increased sharply while the face of the tunnel was within a tunnel diameter of the station point under consideration and reached equilibrium when the <b>excavation</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> at least 3 to 4 tunnel diameters beyond it. Surface settlements above the axis of the tunnel were first observed when the face of the tunnel was directly beneath the station.

Geotechnical monitoring of the initial Macquarie Park Station excavation included inclinometers, extensometers, surface settlement points, endoscopes, convergence points, crown sag points and rock bolt load cells. The geology of the <b>excavation</b> <b>faces</b> <b>was</b> also carefully mapped. On the basis of the mapping, the geological model for this station was refined slightly. The monitoring results were reviewed and back-analysed. The rock mass moduli and the joint stiffness values of the various rock units were varied to “match ” the various monitored behaviour of the excavation. The back-analysis work generally indicated that the original models adopted for design were reasonable. Two “admissible ” combinations of slightly revised geotechnical parameters were identified. Models for subsequent design of the other stations were adjusted to reflect the calibrated parameters. The back-analysis work was also consistent with the relatively high in-situ stresses adopted for the project.

40|$|Abstract. The {{distinguishing}} {{characteristics of}} clay are high cohesion and low permeability. For slurry shield tunnelling in clayey soils, favorable aspects are that slurry cake with low permeability {{can be established}} more easily and effectively at the <b>excavation</b> <b>face</b> thanks to clay’s high cohesion, which is advantageous for stability of <b>excavation</b> <b>face,</b> and long stand-up time of clay offers enough time for backfilling of the tail void before collapse of surrounding soils, thus lessening ground volume loss. However, some typical problems are encountered due to clay’s high cohesion and low permeability. One primary problem is the clogging of slurry pipeline, once in case of which, slurry pressure will fluctuate severely, thus inducing unstable condition at the <b>excavation</b> <b>face.</b> In extreme cases, the pipeline bursts and soils at the <b>excavation</b> <b>face</b> collapse towards the cutterhead for immediate drop of slurry pressure. Another common problem is clay’s adhesion to the cutterhead, which weakens the excavation efficiency of cutterhead and limits advance rate of the shield machine. Tunnelling will inevitably disturb surrounding soils and excess pore water pressure occurs. In clayey soils, due to clay’s low permeability, it usually takes {{quite a long time}} for the excess pore water pressure to disperse completely.
