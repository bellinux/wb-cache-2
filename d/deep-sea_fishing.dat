40|$|We used DNA {{transfection}} {{and protein}} introduction techniques {{to investigate the}} pressure tolerance of cytoskeletal structures in pectoral fin cells derived from the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> Simenchelys parasiticus (habitat depth, 366 – 2, 630  m). The <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> cells have G 418 resistance. The cell number increased until day  6 of cultivation and all cells had died by day  35 when cultured in 35 -mm Petri dishes in medium containing G 418. Enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-tagged human β-actin (EYFP-actin) was stably expressed by 1 in 100, 000 <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> cells. Because almost none of the EYFP-actin was incorporated into actin filaments of the cells, we replaced the relatively large EYFP tag with a chemical fluorescent compound and succeeded in incorporating fluorescently labeled rabbit actins into the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> actin filaments. Most of the filament structure in the cells with rabbit actin inserted underwent depolymerization when subjected to pressure of 100  MPa for 20  min, in contrast to control cells. There were no differences in the tubulin filament structure between control cells and <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> cells with fluorescein-labeled bovine tubulin inserted after the application of pressure ranging from 40 to 100  MPa for 20  min...|$|R
40|$|The {{pressure}} {{tolerance of}} monomeric a-actin proteins from the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> Coryphaenoides armatus and C. yaquinae {{was compared to}} that of non-deep-sea fish C. acrolepis, carp, and rabbit/human/chicken actins using molecular dynamics simulations at 0. 1 and 60 MPa. The amino acid sequences of actins are highly conserved across a variety of species. The actins from C. armatus and C. yaquinae have the specific substitutions Q 137 K/V 54 A and Q 137 K/L 67 P, respectively, relative to C. acrolepis, and are pressure tolerant to depths of at least 6000 m. At high pressure, we observed significant changes in the salt bridge patterns in <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> actins, and these changes are expected to stabilize ATP binding and subdomain arrangement. Salt bridges between ATP and K 137, formed in <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> actins, are expected to stabilize ATP binding even at high pressure. At high pressure, <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> actins also formed a greater total number of salt bridges than non-deep-sea fish actins owing to the formation of inter-helix/strand and inter-subdomain salt bridges. Free energy analysis suggests that <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> actins are stabilized to a greater degree by the conformational energy decrease associated with pressure effect...|$|R

25|$|The {{conventional}} reel or trolling reel {{is similar}} to the baitcasting reel. There are two types of trolling reels, star drag reels and lever drag reels. Star drag reels are like baitcasters, but you move a little lever to put it into free spool. They have a star drag and you have to keep your thumb on them to keep off backlash. The lever drag reel uses the drag to put itself into free spool. It is very difficult to cast a conventional reel, most oven line is dropped behind a boat and left to drift. Conventional reels are for really big fish and are usually used offshore. They are designed for trolling but can also be used for butterfly jigging and <b>Deep-sea</b> <b>fishing</b> ("deep drop"). They are mounted on short rods.|$|E
500|$|Yogo City {{was briefly}} known as Hoover City, after Jake Hoover. Hoover {{was part of}} a {{partnership}} that had been placer mining for gold and is credited as the discoverer of Yogo Sapphires. For several years, he also owned a ranch in nearby Pig-Eye Basin. He later prospected for gold in Alaska and was a <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishing</b> guide in Seattle before eventually returning to the Judith Basin. [...] Western painter C.M. Russell arrived in the area in 1880 as a young cowhand and was hired by Hoover. Russell stated that he learned most of his frontier skills from Hoover, and the two men remained lifelong friends. Millie Ringold, a former slave born in 1845, settled in Fort Benton, Montana after having worked as a nurse and servant for an army general. When gold was discovered at Yogo Creek, Ringold sold her boarding house in Fort Benton and left for the Yogo gold fields, setting up a hotel, restaurant, and saloon in Yogo City where she sang and played music. Ringold later cooked for the English mine, but also worked her own gold claims, even after gold mining was on the decline. She was known as a superb cook and ultimately died in Yogo City in 1906, the last resident of the community. [...] The nearby town of Utica was featured in Russell's 1907 painting A Quiet Day In Utica, which was originally known as Tinning a Dog. Hoover, Ringold, store owner Charles Lehman, and Russell himself are all depicted in the painting, placed between the hitching post and door of the general store.|$|E

40|$|Many <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishes</b> have sensory adaptations {{for living}} at great depths with very limited light. While such adaptations are best {{known in the}} visual system, {{it is likely that}} there are also adaptations in the {{auditory}} system that enable <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishes</b> to use the "auditory scene. " However, there are few data on the inner ear of <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishes.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to add to those data. Since <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishes</b> are rarely taken alive, this study was done through comparative anatomical investigations. Three families were chosen from two major <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> fauna: benthopelagic and mesopelagic. In Antimora rostrata (family Moridae, deep-sea cods), the inner ear structure and its coupling to the swim bladder were analyzed and compared with similar systems found in shallow-water fishes. Part of the membrane labyrinth is thick and rigid. The elaborate structure of the saccular epithelium and the close contact between the ear and swim bladder suggests enhanced hearing sensitivity. In the family Melamphaidae (bigscales and ridgeheads), five species from three genera show broad interspecific variation in the saccular otolith shapes, including having a long otolithic "stalk" in two genera. The presence of this "stalk" corresponds with a gradual change in the saccular maculae. A special type of ciliary bundle on the saccule may have enhanced sensitivity to bundle displacements. Ears were compared between six species of Macrouridae (grenadiers and rattails) that live at different depths. The saccule/lagena size ratio seems to increase with depth, especially between a mesopelagic and a benthopelagic species in the genus Nezumia, in which the benthopelagic species has an enlarged saccule associated with sound production. These findings support the hypothesis that some <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishes</b> have evolved specializations for inner ear function. While it is not possible to test hearing in <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishes,</b> the various adaptations found suggest that at least some such species have evolved specialized structures to enable them to use sound in the deep-sea. Some features in the ears of <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishes</b> that have never been seen in the ears of other vertebrates, which further reveals the structural diversity of fish inner ears in general...|$|R

40|$|The main {{component}} of muscle fiber is α-actin, which plays many {{important roles in}} cellular functions. Monomeric actin protein can polymerize into filament with ATP hydrolysis. The amino acid sequences of actins {{are known to be}} highly conserved in many species. <b>Deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> actins have the specific substitutions, Q 137 K/V 54 A or Q 137 K/L 67 P. Since only Q 137 K substitution is located near the active site, this residue is expected to contribute to the pressure tolerance. Although some experiments showed the effects of substitutions at high pressure, the detailed mechanism of pressure tolerance induced by substitutions is still unclear, especially in molecular level. Using the molecular dynamics simulations of various actins, I analyzed high pressure effects on actin structures and dynamics. In <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> actins, the number of salt bridges increases and several salt bridges specific to <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> actins are observed. The salt bridge between Lys- 137 and ATP in <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> actins stabilizes ATP binding at the active site under high pressure.

The salt bridges which <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> have are suggested to be a key for the mechanism of the pressure tolerance. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2011 - 03 - 24; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(科学); 学位記番号: 修創域第 4071 号; 研究科・専攻: 新領域創成科学研究科情報生命科学専...|$|R
