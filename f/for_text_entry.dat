Sega hoped developers would use the Dreameye for future software, as some later did with Sony's similar EyeToy peripheral. In addition, Sega investigated systems that would have allowed users to make telephone calls with the Dreamcast, and discussed with Motorola the development of an Internet-enabled cell phone that would have used technology from the console to enable quick downloads of games and other data.|$|E

40|$|Modern <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> systems, {{especially}} <b>for</b> {{touch screen}} phones and novel devices, rely on complex underlying {{technologies such as}} error correction and word suggestion.

50|$|The {{layout of}} the PLUM {{keyboard}} is compact, using standard key sizes throughout, rather than the usual widened keytops for control keys. This has led to criticism, particularly over the positioning of the Shift keys. These are {{at each end of}} the home row. Although usable <b>for</b> <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> by a touch-typist experienced with the PLUM layout, they are unpopular with programmers who make extensive use of shift for non-letter characters. The extra Function keys F13, F14, and F15 map to Print Screen, Scroll Lock, and the Pause/Break key respectively, although no Scroll Lock light exists. There are also six blank keys surrounding the Arrow keys, which do nothing.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the form}} factor of the device being {{significantly}} different from the majority of Android devices, many of the default Android UI elements are unwieldy on the WIMM. To compensate for this a set of custom widgets and APIs are provided for developers. These include widgets <b>for</b> <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> and dialog boxes. Applications developed for the WIMM One can be uploaded to the Micro App Store provided by WIMM Labs. Instead of heavy management on the module's screen, users can manage their apps and standard module settings through a web-based console from their desktop or smartphone. Standard settings include calendar setup (Outlook and Google), global cities, sync intervals, and date/time formats. The WIMM One automatically installs applications that have been selected in the web console.|$|E
5000|$|One {{measure of}} {{performance}} <b>for</b> <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> systems is [...] "key strokes per character" [...] (kspc for short). Obviously, the full English PC keyboard has a kspc of 1, as you always need 1 key stroke per character you type. LetterWise has a kspc of 1.15 for English. This means that, on average {{you only need}} to hit an extra key (the key [...] "Next") once per 6-7 letters. In contrast, multi-tap has a kspc of around 2.03 (plus some waiting for two consecutive letters on the same key). Word-based predictive systems like WordWise or T9 have an even lower kspc, however they will only allow you to enter words in their dictionary - if they fail you have to fall back to multi-tap (or to LetterWise {{in the case of}} WordWise).|$|E

30|$|Three {{different}} methods <b>for</b> discrete-tilt-based <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> have been designed, including respective QWERTY-like keyboard layouts and appropriate strategies for character selection/input. Long discrete tilts, intended for shortcut activation, can be concurrently used with regular tilts {{in all of}} the proposed methods. Theoretical predictions <b>for</b> expert <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> rates are provided, according to the combination of movement and linguistic models. The movement model corresponds to both the time of discrete-tilt execution (which has been experimentally determined), and the minimal number of tilts required for target character input (which has been calculated for every particular method). The linguistic model, comprising digraph statistics, has been built basing on available English corpora. Obtained predictions revealed different upper-bound <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> speeds <b>for</b> proposed discrete-tilt-based input methods. The KB method showed to be the fastest one, with a more prominent difference when compared with the low-efficient SC method. According to the results, long tilts generally have no major effect on input efficiency. In conclusion, predictive modeling has been successfully applied to discrete-tilt-based <b>text</b> <b>entry,</b> resulting with upper-bound efficiency estimates that {{can be used as a}} baseline for similar designs relying on tilt interaction.|$|R
