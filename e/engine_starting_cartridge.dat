5000|$|The Mamba was {{a compact}} engine [...] with a 10-stage axial compressor, six {{combustion}} chambers and a two-stage power turbine.

The ASM.3 gave 1,475 ehp and the ASM.6 was rated at 1,770 ehp. A 500-hour test was undertaken in 1948 and the Mamba was the first turboprop engine to power the Douglas DC-3, when in 1949, a Dakota testbed was converted to take two Mambas.|$|R
50|$|The Bell Aerosystems Company XLR81 (Model 8096) was an American liquid-propellant rocket engine, {{which was}} used on the Agena upper stage. It burned UDMH and RFNA fed by a {{turbopump}} in a fuel rich gas generator cycle. The turbopump had a single turbine with a gearbox to transmit power to the oxidizer and fuel pumps. The thrust chamber was all-aluminum, and regeneratively cooled by oxidizer flowing through gun-drilled passages in the combustion chamber and throat walls. The nozzle was a titanium radiatively cooled extension. The engine was mounted on an hydraulic actuated gimbal which enabled it thrust vectoring to control pitch and yaw. Engine thrust and mixture ratio were controlled by cavitating flow venturis on the gas generator flow circuit. <b>Engine</b> <b>start</b> was achieved by solid propellant <b>start</b> <b>cartridge.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{automobile}} manufacturers aspire {{to improve the}} engine design and enhance its life apart from optimizing the energy usage in the actual engine operation. A major concern {{at the time of}} the initial start up at the low loads and speed conditions is the wear of an engine. A significant proportion of the engine life gets compromised due to the adhesive <b>engine</b> <b>start</b> up wear. The start up wear does not exist during the normal engine operation due to the fully established elastohydrodynamic lubricating (EHL) film between the interacting surfaces of the piston assembly and the cylinder liner at the high loads, speeds and the optimum piston-to-bore radial clearances. Such arrangements do not exist in a few initial <b>engine</b> <b>start</b> up cycles. Resultantly, the piston skirts and the 1 st compression ring establish a physical contact with the liner and adhesive wear occurs. This PhD research work numerically models the lubrication of the piston skirts and the 1 st compression ring in the initial <b>engine</b> <b>start</b> up. The 2 -D hydrodynamic and EHL models of the piston skirts are developed in the initial <b>engine</b> <b>start</b> up conditions. The initial <b>engine</b> <b>start</b> up conditions cover the secondary transverse piston displacements and the different start up speeds, radial clearances & viscosity-grades of an engine lubricant. The realistic aspects include the isothermal & adiabatic conditions, the steady-state and transient conditions, the Newtonian and non-Newtonian engine lubricant behavior, the surface roughness factors of the piston skirts and the liner. These aspects are modeled, studied and analyzed separately as part of the hydrodynamic and EHL models of the skirts. The 1 -D and the 2 -D steady-state isothermal Newtonian lubrication models of 1 st compression ring are developed as applicable to the initial <b>engine</b> <b>start</b> up conditions. The simulation analysis are studied to optimize the different realistic aspects/characteristics in an effort to reduce the <b>engine</b> <b>start</b> up wea...|$|R
