He later appeared in the television commercial for Gwalior Suiting on the insistence of a family friend, and was subsequently cast by director Anand Mahindroo. The project eventually got cancelled but [...] Khan relocated to Mumbai {{to pursue a career}} in film; he recalls, [...] "Finally I had some direction and focus. I remember [...] feeling so excited that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Mumbai, stay in my own place and enjoy the adventure of starting my own career." ...|$|E
500|$|Vesna Vulović {{was born}} in Belgrade on 3 January 1950. Her father was a {{businessman}} and {{her mother was a}} fitness instructor. Driven by her love of The Beatles, Vulović travelled to the United Kingdom after completing her first year of university, hoping to improve her English-language skills. Upon returning to Belgrade, she decided to become a flight attendant after seeing one of her friends in a flight attendant's uniform. [...] "She looked so nice and had just been to London for the day," [...] Vulović recalled. [...] "I thought, 'Why shouldn't I be an air hostess? <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> London once a month'." [...] She joined JAT Airways, Yugoslavia's national flag carrier and largest airline, in 1971.|$|E
500|$|During the two {{or three}} years that Mary Shelley spent writing the Spanish and Portuguese Lives from 1834 or 1835 to 1837, she also wrote a novel, Falkner (1837), {{experienced}} the death of her father, William Godwin, started a biography of him, and moved to London after her son, Percy Florence Shelley, entered Trinity College, Cambridge. She had more difficulty with these Lives than with the other volumes' biographies, writing to her friend Maria Gisborne: [...] "I am now about to write a Volume of Spanish & Portugeeze [...] Lives – This is an arduous task, from my own ignorance, & the difficulty of getting books & information". According to Lisa Vargo, a recent editor of the Spanish and Portuguese Lives, Spanish books were hard to come by in England and not much was known regarding Shelley's subjects. However, Shelly ended one plaintive letter to another friend: [...] "The best is that the very thing which occasions the difficulty makes it interesting – namely – the treading in unknown paths & dragging out unknown things – I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Spain." [...] While living in Harrow, she refused to go to the British Library in London, writing: [...] "I would not if I could – I do not like finding myself a stray bird among strange men in a character assimililating [...] to their own". At this time, the British Library had special tables for women in the reading room. While some scholars see her refusal to work there as a mark of [...] "feminist protest" [...] others see it as [...] "matter of comfort and practicality", since the reading rooms were [...] "noisy, badly lit, and poorly ventilated". Shelley's continual problems with finding sources mean that her biographies are based on relatively few works. However, Vargo writes that [...] "there is always a sense of an engaged and intelligent mind at work weighing what should be included, what seems accurate". Shelley tended to focus on obtaining accounts written by people who knew the authors, and when translations of the authors' works were unavailable or poor, she provided her own.|$|E

2500|$|In 1975 Barlow gave a lauded recital at New York City's Town Hall, {{performing}} a difficult program which included [...] "O Hoffnung! [...] O komm" [...] from Beethoven's Leonore (what {{would later become}} [...] "Komm, Hoffnung" [...] from the revised Fidelio), the final scene from Anna Bolena, and a fully staged interpretation of the opening monologue from Elektra. Andrew Porter of The New Yorker wrote that Barlow [...] "has a secure, powerful, and well-schooled soprano. She {{is the kind of}} honest, solidly reliable singer, definite in intention and definite about the actual notes, that is becoming increasingly rare." [...] After comparing her versatility to that of soprano Florence Easton, Porter noted that [...] "there is not much sensuous allure in Barlow's firm, strong tone, and no trace of dainty charm in her heroic manner. Yet I feel that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> hear her even in so apparently inappropriate a role as Verdi's Violetta or Puccini's Mimi with the assurance that nothing would be fudged or shirked. She drew long, clear lines. She plainly knew the meaning of everything she sang, and how to express it." ...|$|E
