A victory in extremis (2–3) at Georgetown, <b>Guyana</b> (with a penalty stopped by goalkeeper Dagoberto Portillo in additional time) allowed El Salvador to stay in the race for qualification to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Unfortunately the home defeat (0–1) against Costa Rica buried the hopes of qualifying for the national team.

5|$|The crisis deepened on 10 October 1970, when Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham {{announced}} that Sobers {{would not be}} allowed to enter <b>Guyana</b> until he apologised. This was a major issue for the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) as the team played at least one Test match a year in Georgetown, the Guyanese capital. The Jamaica Labour Party called for Sobers to resign as captain four days later; Indira Gandhi, the Indian Prime Minister, then {{announced that}} if Sobers were not removed from the West Indies team, India would cancel its upcoming tour of the West Indies, scheduled for early 1971. The WICB considered its options. Cancelling matches in <b>Guyana</b> might prompt Burnham to instruct Guyanese members of the West Indian team to boycott, and sacking Sobers might cause Barbados to withdraw in protest; either way, the unity of the West Indies team was threatened. Meanwhile, no sign of an apology emanated from Sobers.|$|E

40|$|Already one of {{the most}} impoverished {{countries}} in the world, <b>Guyana’s</b> economy is experiencing a downward spiral under IMF and World Bank structural adjustment programs (SAPs), which ironically, were designed to boost the economy. This claim is analyzed with respect to three of <b>Guyana’s</b> most important industries: logging, mining and sugar. However, while SAPs have been a major force in influencing <b>Guyana’s</b> recent development path, the nation’s colonial inheritance must also be considered. Specifically, this legacy set the conditions under which <b>Guyana’s</b> two major political parties, the People’s Progressive Party (PPP) and the People’s National Congress (PNC), both claiming to be adherents to socialism, came to power. Their policies and actions, influenced by the colonial inheritance, eventually led to <b>Guyana’s</b> adoption of austerity measures designed by the international financial institutions (IFIs). This analysis therefore begins with an examination of the rise of these two dominant political parties, the role of colonialism in their emergence and the impact their actions and policies have had in laying the foundations for SAPs. It then turns to examining specifically the effects of SAPs on three major areas of the economy, logging, mining and sugar. This study is significant because it draws attention to the problems associated with SAPs. While structural adjustment has become a widely accepted form of financial assistance over the past two decades, upon closer examination, its negative effects far outweigh the positive ones. Therefore, SAPs should be better tailored to the specifics of <b>Guyana’s</b> economy...|$|R
