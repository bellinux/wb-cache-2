25|$|Several {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that terrestrial eggs evolved from amphibian eggs laid on land to avoid predation on the eggs and competition from other labyrinthodonts. The amniote egg would necessarily have had to evolve from one with an anamniote structure, as those found in fish and modern amphibians. In order for such an egg to excrete CO2 on land without the specialized membranes to aid in respiration, it would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> small, 1cm in diameter or smaller. Such very small eggs with direct development would severely restrict the adult size, thus the amniotes would have evolved from very small animals. A number of small, fragmentary fossils of possibly diadectomorph affinity has been proposed as the first amniote, including Gephyrostegus, Solenodonsaurus, Westlothiana and Casineria. Fossilized footprints found in New Brunswick indicate the first reptiles were established by 315 million years ago.|$|E

500|$|Churchill {{first saw}} Chartwell in July 1921, {{shortly before the}} house and estate were to be auctioned. He {{returned}} the same month with his wife Clementine, who was initially attracted to the property, although her enthusiasm cooled during subsequent visits. In September 1922, when the house had failed to sell at auction, he was offered it for £5,500.

The seller was Captain Archibald John Campbell Colquhoun, who had inherited the house in June 1922 on the death of his brother. Campbell Colquhoun had been a contemporary of Churchill's at Harrow School in the 1880s. On completion of the sale in September 1922, Churchill wrote to him; [...] "I am very glad indeed to have become the possessor of [...] "Chartwell".

500|$|The {{production}} budget for Mr. Nobody was €33 million (US$47 million), ranking {{it the most}} expensive Belgian film to date. The budget was approved before casting was done, based on the prominence of the director's name {{and the strength of}} his script. Half of the budget was provided by the film's French producer Philippe Godeau through his production company Pan-Européenne, and the other half was financed by distributors Wild Bunch and Pathé. Production took place throughout 2007, lasting 120 days and filming in Belgium, Germany, and Canada. Scenes were filmed on location in Montreal, Canada and at Babelsberg Studios in Berlin, Germany. Van Dormael said, [...] "I think the film needed that for these multiple lives. Each time a new style of setting is required. And each life is filmed in a different style, with a different grammar for the camera, the colours, the decor. At the same time, if all the styles <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> contrasted, they knock together by fusing."

500|$|Unlike Music, Madonna had enlisted Ahmadzaï {{also as a}} {{songwriter}} on American Life hence what transpired was Madonna's wholesale adaptation of the producers style and sound. He explained {{that there are some}} influences from his work, but Madonna mostly wanted a minimalist structure for the album. This was beneficial for him since he did not like working with a lot of people, and hence it became a close collaboration. Since electronic music was already popular, Ahmadzaï felt that it was necessary to go back to its underground roots and focus on the songwriting, rather than the technical aspects of recording and mixing. Describing it as modified songwriting, he said that although the concept [...] "might sound simple at first, even rough. But when you pay attention, {{there is a lot of}} technology underneath". This approach was an imperative for American Life. Recorded at three different studios using Ahmadzaï's own gear along with the studio's SSL mixing consoles, the album's recording process was often laborious but was sparse in the musical arrangements of the songs. About the musical composition, Ahmadzaï told to Remix magazine that they [...] "tried to under-produce many tracks to make them sound rougher than the average international pop production. We wanted to do something totally modern and futuristic but not very apparent. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> minimalist and choose every sound very carefully.

If {{you want to play}} comedy then you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> intense about it [...] very, very serious." [...] Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as [...] "Ooh I say!", uttered when she is [...] "stuck for words". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: [...] "It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on." [...] Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, [...] "She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and I like that because it lightens it up a bit." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, Che was {{intended}} to be a much more traditional film based on Jon Lee Anderson's 1997 biography Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life. Actor Benicio del Toro and producer Laura Bickford optioned the film rights to Anderson's book. However, after two years they had not found a suitable writer and the rights expired. During this time, Del Toro and Bickford researched the events depicted in Guerrilla with the idea of exploring Guevara's attempts to start a revolution in Bolivia. Del Toro has said that he previously only thought of Guevara as a [...] "bad guy". For his role, Del Toro spent seven years [...] "obsessively researching" [...] Guevara's life, which made him feel like he [...] "earned his stripes" [...] to interpret the character. Preparation included looking at Guevara's photographs and reading his personal writings. Del Toro read Don Quixote, one of Guevara's favorites, and the first book published and given out free after the Cuban Revolution. Del Toro then personally met with people from different stages of Guevara's life, including Guevara's younger brother and childhood friends, traveling to Cuba where Del Toro met Guevara's widow, family, and [...] "tons of people that loved this man". The visit included a five-minute encounter at a book fair with Fidel Castro, who expressed that he was happy for the [...] "serious" [...] research being undertaken. Such research included collaborating with the three surviving guerrillas from Guevara's ill-fated Bolivian campaign, and with several guerrillas who fought alongside him in Cuba. While researching for both films, Soderbergh made a documentary of his interviews with {{many of the people who}} had fought alongside Guevara. In his encounters with people ranging from fellow guerrillas to Guevara's driver, Del Toro described the reaction as [...] "always the same", stating that he was [...] "blown away" [...] by the [...] "bucketful of love" [...] they still harbored for Guevara. In an interview, Del Toro described Guevara as [...] "a weird combination of an intellectual and an action figure, Gregory Peck and Steve McQueen, wrapped in one". After the film's production concluded, Del Toro professed that [...] "when you tell the story of Che, you're telling a story of the history of a country, so you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> careful".|$|E
