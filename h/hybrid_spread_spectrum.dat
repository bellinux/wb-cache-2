40|$|Abstractâ€”Based {{on direct}} {{sequence}} spread spectrum, M-ary spread spectrum, multicarrier code {{division multiple access}} (CDMA), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology, etc., a new wireless communication anti-interference system, i. e. multi-sub-channels spread spectrum (MSCSS) system, has been proposed here. Transmitting end of the system processes spread spectrum twice using channel pseudo-random code and sub-channel pseudo-random code. Each bit of digital baseband signal was transmitted, through time-division manner, with 16 spread spectrum sub-channel signals. Pseudorandom codes of each spreading sub-channel are orthogonal to each other, so is the center frequency. Meanwhile, receiving end processes every bit of information in manner of parallel accumulation and adaptive threshold decision, to achieve receiving and processing of relevant multi-sub-channel spread spectrum signals, thereby improving noise immunity of communication system. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that anti-interference capacity of the system is superior to traditional <b>hybrid</b> <b>spread</b> <b>spectrum</b> communication system.

It addresses the requirements and the specifications for a communication system providing an integrated solution for navies operating in closed-sea areas under intense enemy jamming activity. The concept of the proposed system is based on spread spectrum technology and on the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS). Spread spectrum technology has been an area of extensive research for many years. Satisfactory practical solutions have been provided through the implementation of several frequency hopping systems that give partial answer to the anti-jam (AJ) problem.

40|$|Nowadays most {{communication}} networks like GSM, WLan or WiMAX {{are based}} on pre-existing infrastructure. These infrastructures are complicated, costly and difficult to deploy in very short time. Whereas Wireless Ad Hoc Networks are infrastructure-free self organizing networks which consist of co-operating nodes. These networks are highly desirable for various emerging applications for military and to extend the range and capacity of infrastructure based wireless networks. One critical issue that we face in Ad Hoc Network {{is the problem of}} scheduling. Scheduling algorithms in an Ad Hoc Network allows the nodes to share the wireless channel efficiently. But on the other hand, the scheduling algorithm needs to be easily implementable in a distributed fashion with little, if any, coordination between nodes in the network. Spread spectrum technologies allow interference averaging and therefore are employed in Ad Hoc networks. There are two major types of spread spectrum physical layer, which are frequency hopping (FH) spread spectrum and direct sequence (DS) spread spectrum. FH-CDMA divides the bandwidth into M sub channels, the receiver only sees the interference from the transmitter side which is on the same sub channel whereas in DS-CDMA we increase the spreading code M to decrease the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) requirement. The purpose of research is to study a <b>hybrid</b> <b>spread</b> <b>spectrum</b> based on physical layer, in which the direct sequence signal is also frequency hoped. The DS will reduce the region of dominating interferes, while frequency hopping will be used within this region intelligently and allow the dominating interferes to transmit on different frequencies.

40|$|Interference is {{the most}} {{dominant}} cause of signal degradation in a wireless ad hoc network. Ad hoc networks must suppress or inhibit interferers around an active receiver to meet a minimum required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio threshold. If the required thresh old is not met, an outage occurs. For meeting this minimum signal-to-interference-plus noise threshold, interference must be mitigated. Current MAC protocols use techniques like carrier sensing, random back-o?s, spread spectrum, guard zone based inhibition, etc. to achieve this goal. The aforementioned techniques result in thinning of nodes in space, at a certain time. This results in a transmission capacity which might be much lesser than what's achievable with state-of the art technology. Transmission capacity is de?ned as the maximum intensity of nodes that can transmit successfully at the same time. The aim {{of this research is}} to develop a MAC protocol, named Intelligent <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Spread</b> <b>Spectrum</b> (IHSS), which works on the principle of not inhibiting any interferer near an active receiver. Intuitively, this will result in a higher intensity of active nodes. However,interference must also be managed in a way such that the maximum outage probability bounds are also met. By using a hybrid of Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) network-wide and intelligent Frequency Hopping (IFH) within a zone around each re ceiver, it is observed, both mathematically and through simulations, that the proposed MAC protocol shows superior performance over ALOHA based DSSS and FHSS net works. The performance is characterized in terms of transmission capacity normalized by the required bandwidth. For small spreading gains, the IHSS's performance falls below that of the optimal sizedguard zone based spatial thinning. The {{reason for this is that}} the spreading gain is not enough for mitigating the interference of the uninhibited nodes. However, IHSS shows much superior performance if the spreading gain increases. An interesting result shows that the achievable transmission capacity, normalized by the spreading gain, shows great improvement with the increase in spreading gain. The notorious near-far e?ect of the DSSS vanishes, and the normalized by spreading gain transmission capacity assumes an asymptotic behaviour, approaching very high values for high spreading gains. This dissertation determines the lower bound on achievable transmission capacity using IHSS, by placing an upper bound on the outage probability. The bound is developed after determining the size of the zone within which intelligent Frequency Hopping should be performed, with the aim to maximize the intensity of simultaneously transmitting successful nodes. The size of the zone in which frequency hopping should be performed is determined with considerations like feasibility of implementation in a distributed manner. Details of how IHSS can be implemented, in a simple manner, through a slight modi?ca tion of the existing, popular IEEE 802. 11 standard MAC (Carrier Sense Multiple Access CSMA) are chalked out. Simulations show the validity of mathematical analysis. E?ects of some network parameters on IHSS performance are also determined in this thesis...|$|E
