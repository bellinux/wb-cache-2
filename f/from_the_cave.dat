5|$|Armed {{with the}} {{knowledge}} gained from their prisoners, Alvarado sent 40 men to cover the exit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> and launched another assault along the ravine from the west, in single file owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with soldiers bearing muskets, each with a companion sheltering him from arrows and stones with a shield. This tactic allowed the Spanish {{to break through the}} pass and storm the entrance of the city. The Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city, and were hunted down by the victorious conquistadors and their Mesoamerican allies. Those who managed to retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block the exit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> the survivors were captured and brought back to the city. The siege had lasted more than a month and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned and moved the inhabitants to the new colonial village of Mixco.|$|E
5|$|At about 10:30, Rybka {{launched}} a frontal attack across the Unac supported {{by at least}} one MG42 machine gun firing into the mouth of the cave. The Germans reached the base of the hill, fifty metres <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> but suffered severe casualties in the assault. They were also running low on water. Prior to this attack, Tito and around 20 staff had taken refuge in the cave.|$|E
5|$|Bertram meets Raimbaut, who {{has arrived}} for an {{assignation}} with Alice. He {{gives him a}} bag of gold and advises him not to marry Alice as his new wealth will attract plenty of women (Ah! l’honnête homme). Raimbaut leaves and Bertram gloats at having corrupted him. Bertram reveals that Robert, to whom he is truly devoted, is his son; he then enters an adjoining cave to commune with the spirits of hell. Alice enters and expresses her love for Raimbaut (Quand je quittai la Normandie). She overhears strange chanting coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> and decides to listen; she learns that Bertram will lose Robert forever if he cannot persuade him to sign away his soul to the Devil by midnight. On emerging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> Bertram realizes that Alice has heard everything (Mais Alice, qu’as-tu donc?). He threatens her and she promises to keep silent. Robert arrives, mourning the loss of Isabelle, and Bertram tells him that to win her he should seize a magic branch from the tomb of Saint Rosalia in a nearby deserted cloister. Although to take it is sacrilege, the branch will give Robert magical powers. Robert declares {{that he will be}} bold and do as Bertram instructs. Bertram leads Robert to the cloister. The ghosts of nuns rise from their tombs, beckoned by Bertram, and dance, praising the pleasures of drinking, gambling and lust. Robert seizes the branch and fends off the demons who surround him.|$|E

As the wights close in, a black-clad rider appears and destroys some of the wights while pulling Meera and Bran onto his horse, allowing them to escape.|$|E
5|$|In 1525 Pedro de Alvarado sent a {{small company}} to conquer Mixco Viejo (Chinautla Viejo), {{the capital of the}} Poqomam. The Spanish {{attempted}} an approach through a narrow pass but were forced back with heavy losses. Alvarado himself launched the second assault with 200 Tlaxcalan allies but was also beaten back. The Poqomam then received reinforcements, and the two armies clashed on open ground outside of the city. The battle was chaotic and lasted for most of the day, but was finally decided by the Spanish cavalry. The leaders of the reinforcements surrendered to the Spanish three days after their retreat and revealed that the city had a secret entrance {{in the form of a}} cave. Alvarado sent 40 men to cover the exit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> and launched another assault along the ravine, in single file owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with musketmen, each with a companion sheltering him with a shield.

Remains of a large Macrotarsomys had previously been reported from other southern Madagascar sites, and {{at least some of}} these may be M.petteri. A karstic deposit near Lake Tsimanampetsotsa (dated to the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene on unclear grounds) contained three species of Macrotarsomys, including a very large one that may well be M.petteri. Remains identified as greater big-footed mouse have been reported from a cave at Ankazoabo in southern Madagascar; these may also be Petter's big-footed mouse.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, a {{team led}} by David Burney {{collected}} breccias containing remains of bats and other animals <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> of Anjohibe in northwestern Madagascar. The bats in the sample were described by Karen Samonds (previously Irwin) in her 2006 Ph.D. dissertation and a 2007 paper. She found several living species in addition to two extinct ones that she described as new, Triaenops goodmani and Hipposideros besaoka. At the time, the genus Triaenops was thought to include three species on Madagascar–Triaenops auritus, Triaenops furculus, and Triaenops rufus. Since then, Steven Goodman and Julie Ranivo have discovered that the name rufus is not in fact applicable to the Madagascar species and proposed the name Triaenops menamena for the Madagascan bats previously known as Triaenops rufus.|$|E
5|$|Lundomys molitor {{was first}} {{described}} in 1887 by Danish zoologist Herluf Winge, who reviewed the materials Peter Wilhelm Lund had {{collected in the}} caves of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Winge used four specimens for his description, including two skull fragments and an isolated maxilla (upper jaw) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> chamber Lapa da Escrivania Nr.5 and a mandible (lower jaw) from Lapa da Serra das Abelhas, but the latter later {{turned out to be}} from a different species, probably Gyldenstolpia fronto. Lund named the animal Hesperomys molitor and placed it in the same genus (Hesperomys) as what is now Pseudoryzomys simplex and two species of Calomys. Subsequently, it was rarely mentioned in the literature on South American rodents; those authors who did mention it placed it in either Oryzomys or Calomys.|$|E
5|$|Microgale macpheei {{is known}} only <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> of Andrahomana. Its past {{presence}} there, {{like that of}} the extinct rodent Hypogeomys australis, suggests formerly more mesic (wet) conditions around the cave, which is currently in a dry area. In addition to M.macpheei, three other tenrecs have been described from subfossil material, but none are currently recognized as valid species; thus, M.macpheei is at present the only known Recently extinct tenrec species. However, there is a remnant patch of mesic forest near Andrahomana, where a population of M.macpheei may survive. Although no radiocarbon dating has been carried out on M.macpheei remains, bones of the rodent Macrotarsomys petteri from layers in the same cave deposit bracketing those where M.macpheei was found yield dates of around 2480 and 1760 Before Present.|$|E

5|$|The {{turning point}} in the war came when Burnham and Bonar Armstrong, a Company native commissioner, found their way through the Matopos Hills to a sacred cave not many miles from the Mangwe district, to a {{sanctuary}} then known only to the Matabele where Mlimo had been hiding. Not far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> was a village (now gone) of about 100 huts filled with many warriors. The two men tethered their horses to a thicket and crawled on their bellies, screening their slow, cautious movements by means of branches held before them. Once inside the cave, they waited until Mlimo entered. Mlimo was said to be about 60 years old, with very dark skin, sharp-featured; American news reports of the time described him as having a cruel, crafty look. Burnham and Armstrong waited until Mlimo entered the cave and started his dance of immunity, at which point Burnham shot Mlimo just below the heart, killing him.|$|E
5|$|In December 1872, Colonel George Crook used Apache scouts {{to find a}} cave in Salt River Canyon {{that was}} being used by Guwevkabaya to mount attacks on White settlers. On December 28, {{accompanied}} by 100 Pima scouts, Captain William Brown led 120 of Crook's men to a siege of the cave. 110 Kwevkepaya were trapped in the cave, when Brown ordered the soldiers to fire at {{the roof of the}} cave, causing rock fragments and lead shrapnel to rain down on the Guwevkabaya. Having nowhere else to go, the besieged gathered around the mouth of the cave, where soldiers (accompanied by Crook) pushed boulders onto them from above, killing 76 of the group. The survivors were taken to Camp Grant as prisoners. The Yavapai were so demoralized by this and other actions by Crook that they surrendered at Camp Verde (renamed Fort McDowell), on April 6, 1873. In 1925, a group of Yavapai from the Fort McDowell Reservation, along with a Maricopa County Sheriff, collected the bones <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> and interred them at the Fort McDowell cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Presumably a {{few days}} later, Katy has since made friends with a monkey and uses her {{stiletto}} heel to form a spear. She uses it to shoot a banana, which she gives to the monkey. In another scene, she bathes in the lake, {{with the help of}} an elephant who sprays her with water from the lake using its trunk. Katy helps a crocodile by brushing its teeth using a toothbrush she has salvaged, and tries to reach her clothes which have been taken by the elephant. At night, she holds a torch and explores a cave. Inside, she watches an animated drawing on the wall in which humans try to kill a tiger with fire; attempting to burn it as it grows stronger and shooting spears which it sends firing back towards them with its roar. The next morning, Katy emerges <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> wearing a leopard-print bikini top, a grass skirt, laced up legs and bare feet, displaying a boost of confidence and holding the spear she made earlier. She stands on top of a waterfall, overlooking the jungle, and then swings across the sky on a vine.|$|E
