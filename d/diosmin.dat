40|$|<b>Diosmin</b> is a {{nutrient}} that {{is widely}} contained in citrus {{and that has}} been indicated to improve glucose metabolism in diabetic disorders. Recently, we demonstrated that <b>diosmin</b> induces β-endorphin to lower hyperglycemia in diabetic rats. However, the mechanisms of <b>diosmin</b> in opioid secretion were unclear. Therefore, we focused on the secretion of opioids from isolated adrenal glands induced by <b>diosmin.</b> The changes in the released β-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (BER) were determined using ELISA. <b>Diosmin</b> increased the BER level in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was markedly reduced in the absence of calcium ions. Activation of the imidazoline I- 2 receptor (I- 2 R) has been introduced to induce opioid secretion. Interestingly, we observed that <b>diosmin</b> activates CHO cells expressing I-R. Additionally, diosmin-increased BER was inhibited by the blockade of I- 2 R in isolated adrenal glands. Additionally, an antagonist of I- 2 R blocked diosmin-induced effects, including the reduction in hyperglycemia and the increase in plasma BER in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (STZ-diabetic rats). Repeated treatment of STZ-diabetic rats with <b>diosmin</b> for one week induced changes in hepatic glycogen, lipid levels, and the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Furthermore, an antagonist of I- 2 R blocked the diosmin-induced changes. Additionally, plasma lipids modified by <b>diosmin</b> were also reversed by the blockade of I- 2 R in STZ-diabetic rats. Taken together, we suggest that <b>diosmin</b> may activate I- 2 R to enhance the secretion of β-endorphin from adrenal glands and to influence metabolic homeostasis, resulting in alleviation of blood glucose and lipids in STZ-diabetic rats...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the in vitro cytotoxic potential of the <b>diosmin</b> in A 431 skin cancer cells.

40|$|AIM: To {{demonstrate}} {{the value of}} <b>Diosmin</b> (flavonidic fraction) {{in the management of}} post-haemorhoidectomic symptoms. METHODS: Eighty-six consecutive patients with grades III and IV acute mixed hemorrhoids admitted to the Anorectal Surgical Department of First Affiliated Hospital, Xinjiang Medical University from April 2009 to April 2010, were enrolled in this study. An observer-blinded, randomized trial was conducted to compare post-haemorhoidectomic symptoms with use of <b>Diosmin</b> flavonidic fraction vs placebo. Eighty-six patients were randomly allocated to receive <b>Diosmin</b> flavonidic fraction 500 mg for 1 wk (n = 43) or placebo (n = 43). The Milligan-Morgan open haemorrhoidectomy was performed by a standardized diathermy excision method. Pain, bleeding, heaviness, pruritus, wound edema and mucosal discharge were observed after surgery. The postoperative symptoms and hospitalization time were recorded. RESULTS: The mean age of the <b>Diosmin</b> group and controls was 53. 2 and 51. 3 years, respectively. In <b>Diosmin</b> group, haemorrhoid piles were of the third degree in 33 patients and the fourth degree in 10; and in the control group, 29 were of the third degree and 14 were of the fourth degree. There was no statistically significance in age, gender distribution, degree and number of excised haemorrhoid piles, and the mean duration of haemorrhoidal disease between the two groups. There was a statistically significant improvement in pain, heaviness, bleeding, pruritus from baseline to the 8 th week after operation (P < 0. 05). Patients taking <b>Diosmin</b> had a shorter hospitalization stay after surgery (P < 0. 05). There was also a significant improvement on the proctoscopic appearance (P < 0. 001). However, there was no statistical {{difference between the two groups}} in terms of wound mucosal discharge.

Next, we assessed cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and antioxidant enzyme activities. In order to examine the underlying molecular mechanisms, we meanwhile analyzed the expressions of Bax, Bcl- 2, total and phosphorylated JNK and p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). <b>Diosmin</b> dose dependently enhanced cell viability following high glucose treatment in ARPE- 19 cells. The activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, as well as the levels of reduced glutathione were decreased, while it was observed that levels of ROS in high glucose cultured ARPE- 19 cells increased.

40|$|BackgroundSaponosides (horse {{chestnut}} seed extract, escin) and flavonoids (<b>diosmin,</b> Daflon 500, Servier, France) exhibit venotonic {{properties that}} have been utilized in treatment of varicose veins. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying the venotonic properties of escin and <b>diosmin</b> are unclear. Because Ca 2 + is a major regulator of venous smooth muscle (VSM) function, we tested the hypothesis that escin and <b>diosmin</b> promote Ca 2 +−dependent venous contraction. MethodsRings of inferior vena cava (IVC) from male rats were suspended in a tissue bath for measurement of isometric contraction. Following control contraction to 96 mM KCl, the effects of escin and <b>diosmin</b> (10 − 10 to 10 − 4 M) on vein contraction were measured. To test the role of intracellular Ca 2 + release, the vein response to escin and <b>diosmin</b> was measured in Ca 2 +−free (2 mM EGTA) Krebs. To test for Ca 2 +−dependent effects, IVC segments were pretreated with escin or <b>diosmin</b> (10 − 4 M) in 0 Ca 2 + Krebs, then extracellular CaCl 2 (0. 1, 0. 3, 0. 6, 1, 2. 5 mM) was added and the [Ca 2 +]e−contraction relationship was constructed. To test for synergistic effects of <b>diosmin,</b> IVC segments were pretreated with <b>diosmin</b> (10 − 4 M), then stimulated with KCl (16 - 96 mM) or escin (10 − 10 to 10 − 4 M) and vein contraction was measured. Contraction data were presented as mg/mg tissue (means ± SEM). ResultsIn IVC segments incubated in normal Krebs (2. 5 mM Ca 2 +), escin caused concentration-dependent contraction (max 104. 3 ± 19. 6 at 10 − 4 M). Escin-induced contraction was not a rigor state, because after washing with Krebs, the veins returned to a relaxed state. In Ca 2 +−free Krebs, there was essentially no contraction to escin. In escin-treated veins incubated in 0 Ca 2 + Krebs, stepwise addition of extracellular CaCl 2 caused corresponding increases in contraction (max 80. 0 ± 11. 1 at 2. 5 mM). In the absence of escin, the α-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (PHE, 10 − 5 M), angiotensin II (AngII, 10 − 6 M), and membrane depolarization by KCl (96 mM) caused significant contraction (122. 5 ± 45. 1, 114. 2 ± 12. 2 and 221. 7 ± 35. 4, respectively). In IVC segments pretreated with escin (10 − 4 M), the contractile response to PHE (9. 7 ± 2. 6), AngII (36. 0 ± 9. 1), and KCl (82. 3 ± 10. 2) was significantly reduced. <b>Diosmin</b> (10 − 4 M) caused small contractions in normal Krebs (11. 7 ± 1. 9) and Ca 2 +−free Krebs (4. 2 ± 2. 2). In diosmin-treated veins incubated in 0 Ca 2 + Krebs, addition of extracellular CaCl 2 caused minimal contraction. <b>Diosmin</b> did not enhance the IVC contraction to PHE, AngII, or escin, but enhanced the contractile response to KCl (24 - 51 mM). ConclusionIn rat IVC, escin induces extracellular Ca 2 +−dependent contraction, but disrupts α-adrenergic and AT 1 R receptor-mediated pathways and depolarization-induced contraction. The initial venotonic benefits of escin may be offset by disruption of vein response to endogenous venoconstrictors, limiting its long-term therapeutic benefits in varicose veins. <b>Diosmin</b> does not cause venous contraction or potentiate the venotonic effects of endogenous venoconstrictors or escin ex vivo, and its use as venotonic {{may need to be}} further evaluated. Clinical RelevanceVenotonic agents are used in clinical practice for treatment of varicose veins. Saponosides such as escin (horse chestnut seed extract) and flavonoids such as disomin (active ingredient in Daflon 500, Servier, France) are commonly prescribed venotonic agents. Although escin is known to form pores in the plasma membrane, the mechanisms of its venotonic action are less clear. Also, while <b>diosmin</b> may affect the venous tissue inflammatory response and lymphatic drainage, its direct effects on vein function have not been fully examined. The present results suggest that escin has significant Ca 2 +−dependent venotonic effects but also reduces the effects of endogenous venoconstrictors, which could limit its long-term therapeutic benefits in varicose veins. Disomin has negligible direct venotonic effects and does not potentiate the effects of endogenous venoconstrictors or escin, and its use as a venotonic agent may need further evaluation...|$|E

Participation of different receptors was also investigated in the presence of haloperidol, bicuculline, and naloxone antagonists. Acute hesperidin administration significantly decreased mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in CCI rats. Antihyperalgesic response of hesperidin, improved by a combination with <b>diosmin</b> (DS 10 /HS 100) in both stimuli, was blockaded by haloperidol, bicuculline, and naloxone, but not WAY 100635, antagonists. Both flavonoids were detected in brain samples. In conclusion, hesperidin alone and combined with <b>diosmin</b> produces antihyperalgesic response in the CCI model in rats. Antihyperalgesic effect of DS 10 /HS 100 combination involves central activity partially modulated by D 2, GABAA, and opioids, but not by 5 -HT 1 A, receptors...|$|E
40|$|A method {{based on}} capilllary zone {{electrophoresis}} (CZE) with UV detection {{was developed for}} simultaneous separation and determination of bioflavonoids hesperidin and <b>diosmin.</b> The analysis was performed in a fused silica capillary with effective lenght 60 cm and 50 μm I. D. UV detection was used at 207 nm. The optimum separation conditions were found out in this work. Samples were loaded hydrodynamically at a pressure of 50 mbar for 20 s. The background electrolyte consisted of 10 mM phosphate, 40 mM borate buffer with 10 % MeOH, 15 mM -CD (pH* 8, 0) at 25 řC. The separation voltage was + 20 kV. Methylparaben was chosen as an internal standard. The calibration dependences were rectilinear {{in the range from}} 0, 025 to 0, 4 mg/ml for hesperidin (R= 0, 9973) and from 0, 05 to 0, 8 mg/ml for <b>diosmin</b> (R= 0, 9987). The single analysis took about 15 min. The method was suitable for determining the bioflavonoids in pharmaceutical preparation Detralex capsules with RSD values 2. 4 % (<b>diosmin)</b> and 3. 1 % (hesperidin), n= 6. The recoveries were from 93, 09 to 102, 30 % as found by the standard addition technique...|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitive}} and simple fluorimetric method {{was developed for}} the determination of <b>diosmin</b> and hesperidin. The proposed method involves the formation of ternary complex with Tb 3 + {{in the presence of}} Tris buffer. The fluorescence quenching of Tb 3 + at 549 and 494  nm (λex at 275 and 248  nm) due to the complex formation was quantitatively measured for <b>diosmin</b> and hesperidin, respectively. The reaction conditions and the fluorescence spectral properties of the complexes have been investigated. Under the described conditions, the proposed method was applicable over the concentration range (4. 93  ×  10 − 6 – 1. 81  ×  10 − 5  mol) and (3. 28  ×  10 − 6 – 1. 64  ×  10 − 5  mol) with mean percentage recoveries 100. 22  ±  0. 89 and 99. 13  ±  0. 72 for <b>diosmin</b> and hesperidin, respectively. The proposed method was applied successfully for the determination of studied drugs in bulk powder, dosage forms and plasma samples. The results obtained by applying the described method were statistically analyzed and compared with those obtained by applying a reported method. The method was validated according to ICH recommendations...|$|E
