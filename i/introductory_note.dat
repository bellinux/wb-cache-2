5|$|Bogdan-Pitești was by then an {{inspiration}} for the blooming Romanian Symbolist movement. In effect, {{he was the first}} Romanian expert on the work of Symbolist celebrities like Odilon Redon, Gustave Moreau, and (his favorite) Alexandre Séon. He soon became a contributor to Literatorul, a Symbolist magazine, and was close friends with its founder, Alexandru Macedonski. In 1897, he was chosen by the latter to edit and promote his book of French-language poems, Bronzes. In the end, Bogdan-Pitești provided the funds needed for Bronzes to be published in Paris. It came out with an <b>introductory</b> <b>note,</b> in which Bogdan-Pitești favorably compared Macedonski with arch-rival Mihai Eminescu. In more general terms, the preface showed Bogdan-Pitești as an unyielding Francophile, who reported with alarm that Romania risked being seduced and then engulfed by German culture. Himself a disciple of Macedonski, T. Vianu comments that Bogdan-Pitești was probably unsuited for the task of introducing Bronzes, and that, despite expectations, the volume failed to impress the French public. He notes the virtually complete lack of press reviews—with the notable exception of a May 1898 article in Mercure de France, written by the Symbolist-anarchist Pierre Quillard.|$|E

Published by Editura Librăriei Leon Alcaly, its original jacket carries an enthusiastic <b>introductory</b> <b>note,</b> by the modernist doyen, poet and journalist Tudor Arghezi.

25|$|With the {{tightening}} of the Ceaușescu regime's control on {{media and the}} literary environment, coupled with the ideological recuperation of national communism and isolationism (the July Theses), Ornea joined the intellectual faction attempting to circumvent censorship and promote a more nuanced take on cultural history. Ornea bowed down to the requirements {{in at least one}} instance: his Lovinescu edition was published without some portions of text that the regime found unpalatable, and the <b>introductory</b> <b>note</b> purported that Lovinescu had points in common with historical materialism. According to historian Lucian Boia, the method was objectionable, but also the only way in which the book could see print. Communist censorship also intervened in Ornea's work as anthologist: as researcher Victor Durnea notes, his Constantin Stere edition only covered the early portion of Stere's career, detailing his loose affiliation with the socialist movement.|$|E

500|$|The typical song {{used by the}} red-backed fairywren to {{advertise}} its territory {{is similar to that}} of other fairy wrens, namely a reel made up of an <b>introductory</b> <b>note</b> followed by repeated short segments of song, starting weak and soft and ending high and shrill with several syllables.

500|$|The precise {{manner in}} which the text was {{obtained}} for MindVox is unclear, although the initial custodian of the text, known only as [...] "Templar" [...] attached to it an <b>introductory</b> <b>note</b> in which he claimed credit. Begos claimed that a troupe of New York University students representing themselves as documentarians attended The Transmission and made a videotape recording of the screen as it displayed the text as an accompaniment of Jillette's reading. Kirschenbaum speculates that this group included the offline persona of Templar or one of his associates. According to this account, ostensibly endorsed by Templar in a post to Slashdot in February 2000, the students then transcribed the poem from the tape and within hours had uploaded it to MindVox. However, according to a dissenting account by hacktivist and MindVox co-founder Patrick K. Kroupa, subterfuge prior to The Transmission elicited a betrayal of trust which yielded the uploaders the text. Kirschenbaum declined to elaborate on the specifics of the Kroupa conjecture, which he declared himself [...] "not at liberty to disclose".|$|E
500|$|The {{first issue}} of If, dated March 1952, went on sale on 7 January of that year. The lead story was Howard Browne's [...] "Twelve Times Zero", a murder mystery with a science-fictional resolution; other stories were from Ray Palmer, Richard Shaver, and Rog Phillips, all writers {{associated}} with the Ziff-Davis magazines. Browne was the editor of Ziff-Davis's Amazing Science Fiction, a leading magazine of the time, and had given Fairman his start {{in the field in}} the late 1940s. Fairman was familiar with Ziff-Davis's stable of writers, and his preference for them was a reflection of his experience, though this did not necessarily serve the magazine well—he referred to the acquisition of Browne's story as [...] "the scoop of the century" [...] and spoke in glowing terms of him in an <b>introductory</b> <b>note</b> despite the fact that Browne was reputed to detest science fiction. In addition to the fiction and the editorial by Fairman, it had a letter column, a profile of Wilson Tucker, a selection of science news, a guest editorial by Ken Slater, a well-known British fan, and an approving review of the TV show Tales of Tomorrow.|$|E

500|$|Davies {{sought to}} {{continue}} the Doctor's long association with music in this special after he realised the Tenth Doctor had yet to show [...] "any aptitude for music". In his <b>introductory</b> <b>note,</b> Davies cites as examples of the Doctor's previous associations with music: the First Doctor disguising himself as Ancient Rome's most famous lyre-player in Emperor Nero's court in The Romans; the Second Doctor playing his recorder; the Third Doctor singing Aggedor to sleep with a Venusian lullaby in The Curse of Peladon; the Fourth Doctor shattering glass by singing {{in the style of}} Dame Nellie Melba in The Power of Kroll; the Fifth Doctor playing a harp on Gallifrey in The Five Doctors; the Sixth Doctor singing opera; the Seventh Doctor playing the spoons; the Eighth Doctor admiring composer Giacomo Puccini; and the Ninth Doctor dancing with Rose Tyler to [...] "In The Mood" [...] by Glenn Miller in [...] "The Doctor Dances". In writing the episode, Davies expressed hope that [...] "this mini-adventure [...] that music can take any shape or form, whether it’s singing, or playing the recorder, or even the spoons." [...] He states that [...] "music can go anywhere, reach anyone, and make better people of us all. Just like the Doctor." ...|$|E

2500|$|Graham {{collaborated with}} writer Don McGregor on the {{critically}} lauded [...] "Black Panther" [...] series {{that ran in}} Jungle Action #6–24 (Sept. 1973–Nov. 1976), becoming the series' regular penciler with issue #11 (Sept. 1974) and leaving after penciling the first five pages of issue #22 (July 1976). Bob Almond, inker {{for much of the}} run of The Black Panther vol. 3, dedicated his work in memoriam to Graham in an <b>introductory</b> <b>note</b> to issue #17 (April 2000). The pseudonymous Buzz Maverik wrote in Ain't It Cool News, [...] "I know the [...] artist, Billy Graham, was black. His cool Marvel Bullpen name was 'The Irreverent' Billy Graham. For me, even though I later learned that Jack Kirby created the Panther, Graham will always be the definitive Panther artist. His art, even more than McGregor's writing, made T'Challa one of what I call the 'grown men' of the Marvel Universe, the others being Daredevil and Iron Man. Those three seemed like the kind of adult I aspired to be, with cool jobs, cool hobbies (superheroing), and cool chicks." [...] In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked McGregor and Graham's run on Jungle Action third on its list of the [...] "Top 10 1970s Marvels".|$|E
2500|$|During the 1990s, critics {{continued}} {{to praise the}} poem with many critics placing emphasis on what the Preface adds to the poem. David Perkins, in 1990, argued that [...] "Coleridge's <b>introductory</b> <b>note</b> to [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] weaves together two myths with potent imaginative appeal. The myth of the lost poem tells how an inspired work was mysteriously given to the poet and dispelled irrecoverably." [...] Also in 1990, Thomas McFarland stated, [...] "Judging by the number and variety of critical effort to interpret their meaning, {{there may be no}} more palpably symbolic poems in all of English literature than [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] and The Ancient Mariner." [...] In 1996, Rosemary Ashton claimed that the poem was [...] "one of the most famous poems in the language" [...] and claimed the Preface as [...] "the most famous, but probably not the most accurate, preface in literary history." [...] Richard Holmes, in 1998, declared the importance of the poem's Preface while describing the reception of the 1816 volume of poems: [...] "However, no contemporary critic saw the larger possible significance of Coleridge's Preface to 'Kubla Khan', though it eventually {{became one of the most}} celebrated, and disputed, accounts of poetic composition ever written. Like the letter from the fictional 'friend' in the Biographia, it brilliantly suggests how a compressed fragment came to represent a much larger (and even more mysterious) act of creation." ...|$|E
