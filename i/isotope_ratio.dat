Usual hosts include species from the families Fagaceae (beeches and oaks) and Pinaceae. The ectomycorrhizae that P.niger forms with Norway spruce (Picea abies) has been comprehensively described. It is distinguished from the ectomycorrhizae of other Thelephorales species by the unique shape of its chlamydospores. Stable <b>isotope</b> <b>ratio</b> analysis of the abundance of the stable isotope carbon-13 shows that P.niger has a metabolic signature close to that of saprotrophic fungi, indicating that it may be able to obtain carbon from sources other than a tree host.|$|E
5|$|Paleoclimatologists {{measure the}} ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to {{determine}} the climate {{millions of years ago}} (see oxygen <b>isotope</b> <b>ratio</b> cycle). Seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope, oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12% heavier oxygen-18, and this disparity increases at lower temperatures. During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18. Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate. Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years.|$|E

Declining populations of all three species of pinnipeds prompted this study to determine if changes in diet, likely resulting from food limitation, contributed to the declines. Stable carbon and nitrogen <b>isotope</b> <b>ratios</b> were analyzed in the vibrissae (whiskers) and body tissues of pinnipeds from 1993 - 1998 and compared with muscle tissue from prey species {{during the same time}} period to determine pinniped trophic dynamics. Vibrissae growth rate studies revealed harbor seal vibrissae are only retained for one year and then replaced, while Steller sea lions maintain their vibrissae for several years. Isotopic data from all three species are consistent with diets composed of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) at various times and locations throughout the year. Steller sea lion and northern fur seal vibrissae revealed regular oscillations along their lengths in both carbon and nitrogen <b>isotope</b> <b>ratios</b> that likely corresponded to regional isotopic differences. As these animals moved or migrated from one region to another during the year, they metabolically incorporated the different regional <b>isotope</b> <b>ratios</b> through their prey. Because these animals return to their rookery to pup, breed and molt each year, the <b>isotope</b> <b>ratios</b> in the vibrissae showed a regular pattern of enrichment and deplection. Harbor seals, which tend to stay in one geographic location, have relatively static <b>isotope</b> <b>ratios</b> in their vibrissae, while seals that moved into offshore waters had fluctuating <b>isotope</b> <b>ratios</b> that corresponded to regional difference.
