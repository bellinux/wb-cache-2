50|$|The {{ultimate}} {{owners of}} the publication, Kerry Group's Robert Kuok and his family, are widely recognised to be inclined towards the central government of China, and {{questions have been raised}} over the paper's editorial independence and self-censorship. The paper's editors have nevertheless asserted their independence during Kuok's ownership. There have been concerns, denied by Kuok, over the forced departures, in rapid succession, of several staff and contributors who were considered critical of China's government or its supporters in Hong Kong. These included, in the mid-1990s, their popular cartoonist Larry Feign, humour columnist Nury Vittachi, and numerous China-desk staff, namely 2000-01 <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> <b>editor</b> Danny Gittings, Beijing correspondent Jasper Becker and China <b>pages</b> <b>editor</b> Willy Lam.|$|R

[...] For example, Robert Kuok, who has business interests all over Asia, has been criticized over the departures of several China desk staff in rapid succession since he acquired the South China Morning Post, namely the <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> <b>editor</b> Danny Gittings, Beijing correspondent Jasper Becker, and China <b>pages</b> <b>editor</b> Willy Lam.

In response to the controversy, an article was published the next day on the New York Times <b>Editorial</b> <b>Page</b> <b>Editor's</b> blog, summarizing the variety of opinions, pro and con, on this topic. [...] Patricia McGuire, the President of Trinity Washington University spoke in favor of diversifying philosophy: [...] "Let's face facts: there's a Muslim Mayor in London, signifying {{the fact that even}} those who revere All Things British need {{to catch up with the}} now-settled reality of great diversity in contemporary life. The canon of learning should reflect that, including Philosophy." [...] However, many readers expressed views similar to the following: [...] "Please preserve us from your political correctness. ...there's a reason that Europe leaped ahead of the rest of the world. I do not believe that we should sacrifice that merely because of an ooshy gooshy need to pretend that all cultures are equally advanced." ...|$|R

5000|$|Since Robert Kuok {{acquired}} the South China Morning Post in 1993, {{there have been}} concerns over the forced departures, in rapid succession, of several staff and contributors who were considered critical of China or its supporters in Hong Kong. Before the handover, their popular cartoonist Larry Feign, humour columnist Nury Vittachi were dismissed. Since 1997, {{there have been numerous}} departures of China-desk staff, namely 2000-01 <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> <b>editor</b> Danny Gittings, Beijing correspondent Jasper Becker; China <b>pages</b> <b>editor</b> Willy Lam departed after his reporting had been publicly criticised by Robert Kuok. Gittings complained that he [...] "repeatedly came under pressure to tone down coverage of politically sensitive issues". Editor-in-Chief Wang Xiangwei was criticised for his decision to reduce the paper's coverage of the death of Li Wangyang on 7 June 2012. Wang reportedly reversed the decision to run a full story, and instead published a two-paragraph report inside the paper; other news media reported it prominently. A senior staff member who sought to understand the decision circulated the resulting email exchanges, that indicate he received a stern rebuff from Wang. Wang is mainland-born, {{and is a member of}} the Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Jilin; the paper has since stepped up coverage of the death and aftermath as major news stories. Reporter Paul Mooney, whose contract with the paper was not renewed in May 2012, said that the Li Wangyang story was not an isolated incident.|$|R

2500|$|Perdue {{began working}} on human rights issues in 2000, when he {{traveled}} to Cuba {{to report on the}} condition of ordinary Cubans and dissidents, publishing an article on the subject in Investor’s Business Daily. In 2008, he wrote a series of articles that were published in the U.S. and Peru concerning a Peruvian general that had been falsely accused of collaborating with narcotraffickers in the VRAE region of Peru, a notorious trafficking area. The exposé aided in the general's subsequent exoneration by the Peruvian Supreme Court. In 2009, he traveled to Honduras as part of the Washington Senior Observer Group for the historic presidential election as an international election observer. In 2010, he served as an expert witness in a precedent-setting human rights trial in the Miami Circuit Court, which prevented the extradition of a U.S. citizen to Argentina, the defendant’s native country. In 2012, Perdue began writing articles highlighting the abrogation of free speech in Ecuador, after President Rafael Correa ostensibly [...] "used the courts, under what could be considered dictatorial powers, to jail journalists for calling him a dictator.” Correa had actually sued the <b>editorial</b> <b>page</b> <b>editor</b> of El Universo, an Ecuadorian newspaper, for saying, in an opinion piece, that he was acting like a dictator. The <b>editorial</b> <b>page</b> <b>editor,</b> Emilio Palacio, was subsequently forced to seek asylum in the U.S. In 2013, Perdue attended the Human Rights Foundation’s annual Oslo Freedom Forum in Oslo, Norway, to interview Cuban dissident and leader of the Ladies in White, Berta Soler, and wrote an article for the Miami Herald on Soler and the racial discrimination suffered by Afro-Cubans under the Castro dictatorship. He also interviewed Tutu Alicante, a human rights activist from Equatorial Guinea, and published an article for the UK Commentator in London.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Title: “Inifrån åsiktsfabriken” - en kvalitativ studie av ledarjournalisters uppfattningar om sin yrkesroll Authors: Noa Söderberg, Jonatan Andersson and Sebastian Lindström Subject: Undergraduate {{research}} paper in journalism studies, Department of journalism, media and communication (JMG), University of Gothenburg Term: Spring 2017 Supervisor: Britt Börjesson, JMG, University of Gothenburg Pages/words: 45 pages, 18 508 words (including abstract and appendix). Purpose: The {{main purpose of}} this study is to examine how the editorial boards of Swedish newspapers perceive their professional role, their organizational procedures and their professional goals and ideals. Method: Qualitative in-depth interviews with seven Swedish editorial journalists, representing four newspapers. Procedure: We have interviewed seven editorial journalists, representing the editorial boards of four different Swedish newspapers, and transcribed and analyzed them based on Jürgen Habermas democratic theories, Lars Nords theories about the future driving force of the <b>editorial</b> <b>pages,</b> and commercialization as Jesper Strömbäck and Anna Maria Jönsson have described it. Results: How the editorial boards choose their subjects, sources and angles are determined by a desire to be relevant and comment on issues within the news flow, to promote and be a certain ideological voice and to write in a fashion that leads to more online reading and more clicks. The <b>editorial</b> <b>page</b> <b>editors</b> are not interested in recruiting editorial writers that have become media personalities beforehand, but want to develop new writers into media personalities by themselves. The professional ideals of the editorial journalists are partly based in a desire to form a deliberative discussion (as the one advocated by Jürgen Habermas), and partly in a participatory democratic desire to influence the public debate and the political climate. Key words: Editorial journalism, editorial writers, deliberative democracy, Habermas, commercialization, Lars Nord, media personalit...|$|R
50|$|The job of {{the public}} editor is to {{supervise}} the implementation of proper journalism ethics at a newspaper, and to identify and examine critical errors or omissions, and {{to act as a}} liaison to the public. They do this primarily through a regular feature on a newspapers <b>editorial</b> <b>page.</b> Because public <b>editors</b> are generally employees of the very newspaper theyre criticizing, it may appear as though there is a possibility for bias. However, a newspaper with a high standard of ethics would not fire a public editor for a criticism of the paper; the act would contradict the purpose of the position and would itself be a very likely cause for public concern.|$|R
50|$|Stephen Samuel Rosenfeld (July 26, 1932 - May 2, 2010) was an American {{journalist}} {{who worked as}} an editor and columnist for The Washington Post for 40 years.

2500|$|In 1987, Charlie Whipple, {{a former}} Boston Globe <b>editorial</b> <b>page</b> <b>editor,</b> {{revealed}} {{a conversation that}} he had with Sergeant Edward J. Seibolt in 1937. According to Whipple, Seibolt said that [...] "we switched the murder weapon in that case", but indicated that he would deny this if Whipple ever printed it. However, {{at the time of}} the Sacco and Vanzetti trial, Seibolt was only a patrolman, and did not work in the Boston Police ballistics department; Seibolt died in 1961 without corroborating Whipple's story. In 1935, Captain Charles Van Amburgh, a key ballistics witness for the prosecution, wrote a six-part article on the case for a pulp detective magazine. Van Amburgh described a scene in which Thayer caught defense ballistics expert Hamilton trying to leave the courtroom with Sacco's gun. However, Thayer said nothing about such a move during the hearing on the gun barrel switch and refused to blame either side. [...] Following the private hearing on the gun barrel switch, Van Amburgh kept Sacco's gun in his house, where it remained until the Boston Globe did an expose in 1960.|$|E
2500|$|The {{condemnation}} of an Iranian Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani {{for the crime}} of adultery, with a sentence of execution by stoning led to calls for Lula da Silva's intervention on her behalf. On the issue, Lula commented that [...] "I need to respect the laws of a [...] country. If my friendship {{with the president of}} Iran and the respect that I have for him is worth something, if this woman has become a nuisance, we will receive her in Brazil." [...] The Iranian government, however, declined the offer. Lula da Silva's actions and comments sparked controversy. Mina Ahadi, an Iranian Communist politician, welcomed Lula da Silva's offer of asylum for Ashtiani, but also reiterated a call for an end to stoning altogether and requesting a cessation of recognition and support for the Iranian government. Jackson Diehl, Deputy <b>editorial</b> <b>page</b> <b>Editor</b> of The Washington Post, called Lula da Silva the [...] "best friend of tyrants in the democratic world" [...] and criticised his actions. Shirin Ebadi, Iranian human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner viewed Lula da Silva's intervention in a more positive light, calling it a [...] "powerful message to the Islamic Republic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Buchanan {{joined the}} St. Louis Globe-Democrat at age 23. During {{the first year}} of the United States embargo against Cuba in 1961, Canada–Cuba trade tripled. The Globe-Democrat {{published}} a rewrite of Buchanan's Columbia master's project under the eight-column banner [...] "Canada sells to Red Cuba — And Prospers" [...] eight weeks after Buchanan started at the paper. According to Buchanan's memoir Right from the Beginning, this article was a career milestone. Buchanan later said the embargo strengthened the communist regime and he turned against it. Buchanan was promoted to assistant <b>editorial</b> <b>page</b> <b>editor</b> in 1964 and supported Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign. The Globe-Democrat did not endorse Goldwater and Buchanan speculated there was a clandestine agreement between the paper and President Lyndon B. Johnson. Buchanan recalled: [...] "The conservative movement has always advanced from its defeats... I can't think of a single conservative who was sorry about the Goldwater campaign." [...] According to the foreword (written by Pat Buchanan) in the most recent edition of Conscience of a Conservative, Buchanan was a member of the Young Americans for Freedom and wrote press releases for that organization. He served as an executive assistant in the Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander, and Mitchell law offices in New York City in 1965.|$|E
