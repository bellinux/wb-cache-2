500|$|History {{views the}} results of the [...] "Tuskegee Airmen Experiment" [...] as a {{tremendous}} success, in which Parrish played a significant role, and proved that blacks could perform well in both leadership and combat roles. Parrish felt people should be judged by their capability, not their color. During its development Parrish would often return from Washington DC depressed because of the massive resistance to the Tuskegee program. Decades later at Tuskegee Airmen reunions, when Parrish's name was called everyone applauded with a standing ovation. The experience of the AAF during World War II necessitated that the military review its policies on the utilization of black servicemembers. Confrontation, discussion, and coordination with both black and white groups led AAF leaders to the conclusion that active commitment, leadership, and equal opportunity produced a more cost-effective, viable military force. In 1948, President Harry Truman signed an Executive Order on equality of treatment and opportunity in the military, due in no small part to the successes of the Tuskegee Airmen. Parrish was commander of Tuskegee Field from 1942 to 1946 and historians generally <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> improving morale, living conditions, relations between blacks and whites, and relations with local citizens.|$|E
500|$|Thierry Henry {{paid tribute}} to Larsson's {{contribution}} to Barcelona's win after the game, saying, [...] "People always talk about Ronaldinho, Eto'o, Giuly and everything, but I didn't see them today, I saw Henrik Larsson. He came on, he changed the game, that is what killed the game. Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o and people like that; {{you need to talk}} about the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight." [...] Henry also remarked, [...] "You have to remember that Barcelona is a team. It's not Eto'o, it's not Ronaldinho. On Wednesday, the man who made the difference was Henrik Larsson. You have to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> that because when he came on he made some amazing runs around the box and he showed he is a team player. You saw two times he fed the ball back to people and that's what I always talk about, he is a team player. He did that against us, even though the first goal was a close offside decision." [...] Larsson's addition giving Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by international press.|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, Uncut {{magazine}} {{found the}} album [...] "laudable, but overreaching." [...] Vibe felt that Timberlake and Timbaland's songwriting is [...] "frustratingly awkward". Alexis Petridis, writing for The Guardian, {{said that the}} album [...] "almost works: close, but no enema." [...] Ben Williams of New York magazine commented that Timberlake is [...] "better at being sappy than sexy" [...] and concluded, [...] "If he hasn't yet invented a persona intriguing enough {{to live up to}} his music, <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> being one of the few white men still brave enough to make black music." [...] Robert Christgau of Rolling Stone found Timberlake's [...] "best new" [...] songs [...] "thrilling", although [...] "some of the up-tempo stuff flirts with mechanical muscle-flexing" [...] and [...] "Losing My Way" [...] is a [...] "well-meaning" [...] but [...] "clueless embarrassment." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, he cited [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "SexyBack" [...] as highlights and gave the album a three-star honorable mention, indicating [...] "an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure." ...|$|E

500|$|Tierney in 2006 {{assembled}} {{a group of}} investors to form Philadelphia Media Holdings LLC, a group started with the purpose of buying The Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News. Chief executive of Philadelphia Media Holdings, Mr. Tierney also became the publisher of the Philadelphia Inquirer shortly after Philadelphia Media Holdings bought the paper. Initially, there were concerns about Tierney's neutrality because of earlier roles he held working in Republican politics and clashes he had with some reporters. But Mr. Tierney calmed those fears by hiring respected journalist and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner William K. Marimow as editor of The Inquirer and by signing a pledge not to interfere with the editorial content of the two newspapers. Under Mr. Marimow, the editorial quality of The Inquirer improved as the paper returned to its roots by doing more investigative stories. Initially, circulation increased in 2007 and advertising sales improved. Meanwhile, the Daily News won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for investigative journalism for a series of stories on corrupt Philadelphia cops. However, the 2008 financial crisis led to a steep drop in advertising revenue. At the same time, circulation dropped as more readers migrated to the Internet. Newspaper values across the country plummeted by 90 percent or more. Mr. Tierney's group bought the paper {{at the top of the}} market and was saddled with a heavy debt burden. As a result, Philadelphia Media Holdings was forced to file for bankruptcy protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On April 28, 2010, the Philadelphia Inquirer, Daily News and philly.com were sold at a bankruptcy auction to a group of the original lenders, hedge funds and vulture investors led by Angelo Gordon & Company for $139 million. Mr. Tierney stepped down from his position as CEO of the company on May 21, 2010 in order to allow for a smooth transition. Several news accounts of his tenure have called him an [...] "improbable savior" [...] and an [...] "unlikely warrior." [...] Other accounts have said, [...] "For Tierney...his tenure as CEO by many measures could be rated a success." [...] and [...] "As for Tierney, <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> trying." ...|$|E

[...] The Gazette praised the Surveyor General's intelligence and fairness while extending the thanks of the Salt River valley.

The three-hour meeting was arranged by Buster Soaries, the former New Jersey Secretary of State and Stringer's pastor. New Jersey governor Jon Corzine planned to attend the meeting but was injured {{in a car accident}} {{on the way to the}} meeting. Imus left without commenting, but Stringer said the meeting went well. She later commented that they had accepted Imus's apology, and [...] "It would sadden me for anyone to lose their job,... And he came [...] in spite of the fact that he lost his job. So let's <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> that."

2500|$|The early 1950s {{literature}} transformed blitzkrieg into {{a historical}} military doctrine, which carried {{the signature of}} Liddell Hart and Guderian. The main evidence of Liddell Hart's deceit and [...] "tendentious" [...] report of history {{can be found in}} his letters to Erich von Manstein, Heinz Guderian and the relatives and associates of Erwin Rommel. Liddell Hart, in letters to Guderian, [...] "imposed his own fabricated version of blitzkrieg on the latter and compelled him to proclaim it as original formula". Kenneth Macksey found Liddell Hart's original letters to Guderian in the General's papers, requesting that Guderian <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> [...] "impressing him" [...] with his ideas of armoured warfare. When Liddell Hart was questioned about this in 1968 and the discrepancy between the English and German editions of Guderian's memoirs, [...] "he gave a conveniently unhelpful though strictly truthful reply. ('There is nothing about the matter in my file of correspondence with Guderian himself except...that I thanked him...for what he said in that additional paragraph'.)".|$|E
2500|$|The 20th century {{historian}} of Paris René Héron de Villefosse {{shared the same}} view of Haussmann's renovation: [...] "in less than twenty years, Paris lost its ancestral appearance, its [...] character which passed from generation to generation... the picturesque and charming ambiance which our fathers had passed onto us was demolished, often without good reason." [...] Héron de Villefosse denounced Haussmann's central market, Les Halles, as [...] "a hideous eruption" [...] of cast iron. [...] Describing Haussmann's renovation of the Île de la Cité, he wrote: [...] "the old ship of Paris was torpedoed by Baron Haussmann and sunk during his reign. It was perhaps the greatest crime of the megalomaniac prefect and also his biggest mistake...His work caused more damage than a hundred bombings. It was in part necessary, and one should <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> his self-confidence, but he was certainly lacking culture and good taste...In the United States, it would be wonderful, but in our capital, which he covered with barriers, scaffolds, gravel, and dust for twenty years, he committed crimes, errors, and showed bad taste." ...|$|E

2500|$|Much as Dmitry disliked his tight upper-lipped, stone-faced dad, {{later he}} had to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> being {{the first one to}} have noticed and, in his emotionless way, {{appreciate}} his first poetic exercises. In July 1879, in Alupka, Crimea, Sergey Ivanovich introduced Dmitry to the legendary Princess Yekaterina [...] Vorontzova, once Pushkin's sweetheart. The grand dame admired the boy's verses: she (according to a biographer) [...] "spotted in them a must-have poetic quality: the metaphysical sensitivity of a young soul" [...] and encouraged him to soldier on. Somewhat different was young Merezhkovsky's encounter with another luminary, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, staged by his well-connected father again. As the boy started reciting his work, nervous to the point of stuttering, the famous novelist listened rather impatiently, then said: [...] "Poor, very poor. To write well, one has to suffer. Suffer!" [...] – [...] "Oh no, I'd rather he won't – either suffer, or write well!", the appalled father exclaimed. The boy left Dostoyevsky's house much frustrated by the great man's verdict. Merezhkovsky's debut publication followed the same year: Saint Petersburg magazine Zhivopisnoye Obozrenye published two of his poems, [...] "Little Cloud" [...] and [...] "The Autumn Melody". A year later another poem [...] "Narcissus" [...] was included in a charity compilation benefiting destitute students, edited by Pyotr Yakubovich.|$|E
