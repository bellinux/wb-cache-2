40|$|This paper {{provides}} evidence {{based on}} French macroeconomic data, that shocks {{on the cost}} of oil inputs are transmitted asymmetrically to the prices of fuel. We use an error correction model to estimate the dynamics of the transmission of the cost of crude oil expressed in French currency, to the production and before taxes retail prices of several kinds of fuel. We simulate the responses of the production and retail prices to positive as well as negative shocks affecting the cost of crude oil for three kinds of fuel: premium, diesel oil and <b>domestic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil.</b> We also test for the presence of asymmetries in the transmission of crude oil to retail prices for two kinds of unleaded premium. The results for all five products robustly point to the existence of an asymmetry in the overall transmission of positive and negative cost shocks to prices, in the sense that crude oil cost increases are added to retail fuel prices faster than decreases are substracted. In the case of diesel oil, the asymmetry turns out to be significant at the production as well as the distribution stages. For <b>domestic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil,</b> however, only firststage (production) asymmetries are significant, whereas for premium only secondstage (distribution) asymmetries may be robustly pointed out. Finally, measured asymmetry lengths range from one month to one quarter. prices, oil, asymmetry, error correction models, bootstrap...|$|E

40|$|In this work, the {{evaporation}} {{characteristics of}} different pure vegetable oils (cottonseed oil, jatropha oil, and rapeseed oil), <b>domestic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> (DFO) and blends of <b>domestic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> and cottonseed oil {{have been studied}} using the fibre-suspended droplet evaporation technique. The constants of evaporation of pure products were determined {{as well as the}} influence of the proportion of DFO fraction on the mechanisms of vaporization process of cottonseed oil in the temperature range of 578 Ke 917 K under atmospheric pressure. The results show that the DFO evaporates completely in the range of temperatures considered in contrast to vegetable oils that vaporize completely only for temperatures higher than or equal to 773 K. Above 873 K, the behaviour of vegetable oils becomes similar to a single component product and the d 2 law is respected. At a given temperatures range, constants of evaporation of the three vegetable oils are of the same order of magnitude. The results also show that blends of cottonseed oil and DFO vaporize following a sequential distillation mechanism: DFO is evaporating first, followed by a transient phase, and then cottonseed oil vaporizes following the same trends than observed for pure vegetable oils. For low percentages of cottonseed oil (_ 40 %) in the mixture, formation of bubbles can be observed {{at the end of the}} process at 684 K. When the concentration of vegetable oil in the droplet increases, the mechanism of pure diffusion becomes predominant. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|Our {{contribution}} {{demonstrates a}} new way of fuel desulfurization, namely selective oxidation of organic S-compounds present in fuels to water-soluble sulfur compounds followed by in situ extraction of the latter into an aqueous phase. Different from common oxidative desulfurization (ODS) processes, we demonstrate a technique that converts sulfur compounds in fuel to a large extent to sulfate (60 – 70 %) using oxygen as the oxidant and an aqueous H$_{ 8 }$P$_{ 5 }$VMo$_{ 7 }$O$_{ 40 }$ (HPA- 5) solution as the catalyst phase. Other water-soluble desulfurization products are sulfoacetic acid (SAA) with a share of 10 – 20 %, 2 -sulfobenzoic acid (2 -SBA), and 2 -(sulfooxy) benzoic acid (2 -SOBA), the latter two with a share of < 10 %. The new desulfurization method has been optimized for removing benzothiophene from isooctane, giving the best results with a degree of desulfurization of 99 % applying 120 °C, 20 bar oxygen pressure, and 1000 rpm of 6 h reaction time using a volume water/oil ration of 10 / 1.

40|$|A {{new concept}} of {{combustion}} control system, {{based on an}} optical information from the flame spectrum, is applied to a <b>domestic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> boiler. The objective is to achieve the maximum thermal efficiency of the boiler, while keeping a stable flame and the pollutant emissions as low as possible. CH radicals and soot continuum emissions, measured with a spectrometer just downstream of the burner exit, provide the information needed. Characterisation tests of the system’s dynamics in different operating conditions where made in order to optimise the controller performance and to verify the sensor response in face to external factors. For a given burner power, the control is performed by varying only the air damper position (the flame holder position was fixed). This solution led to minimal NO emission with an improved flame stability. On the other hand, the sensor follows well changes in fuel properties and ambient conditions (external disturbances). The control strategy was tested for two power conditions (high and low firing rates of the burner). Optimal values of air excess less than 6 % have been achieved for both conditions. The main limitation arise from large soot production at low firing rate where the soot emission level was found around five times greater than at high firing rate...|$|E

40|$|The paper reviews recent {{developments}} in the pass-through of international to domestic petroleum product prices, in the different fuel pricing regimes, and in fuel subsidies {{in a range of}} emerging market and developing economies. The main finding of the paper is the limited price pass-through in many countries and the consequent increase in fuel subsidies. The paper proposes that key elements of a successful strategy to contain subsidies should comprise: making subsidies explicit; making pricing mechanisms more robust; combining reductions in subsidies with measures to protect the poorest; using the resulting savings well, and transparency and consultation.

40|$|This thesis empirically evaluates {{three key}} {{financial}} and macroeconomic issues: Essay 1 examines {{the effectiveness of}} China <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> futures in hedging a <b>domestic</b> spot <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> position as well as hedging a spot position in the Singapore <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> market. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first study of this kind. Dynamic Bi-variate GARCH and constant volatility models are estimated to derive the optimal hedging ratios and hedging effectiveness of China <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> futures. That effectiveness is assessed by several criteria, for both in- and out-of-sample periods. Essay 2 aims to investigate the relationship between the oil, gold and US stock markets. By employing a Tri-variate GARCH(1, 1) model, this is the first study to explore how volatility is transmitted among those three markets. Additionally, this is the first study to compare Tri-variate GARCH and Bi-variate GARCH modelling strategies as vehicles for determining the volatility interrelations between these markets. Essay 3 explores the power of conventional macroeconomic factors to explain the currency fluctuations over recent years, including the 1997 crises, in six Asian countries. Two regimes Markov Switching TGARCH and constant volatility models are used to determine the causes of market pressures on exchange rates, and the probability of the timing of a currency attack. The Markov Switching models do not require an ex-ante definition of a threshold value to distinguish stable and volatile state like Logit models do, and they can capture the appreciating currency attacks as well as the depreciating ones. The Markov Switching models are also compared with Multinomial Logit models in their ability to detect crises. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} coal/fuel oil substitution potential in Kenya and to assess {{the implications of the}} potential both to the dependence on imported crude oil and to the capability of the economy to adjust orderly in response to a possible fuel oil supply deficit which may result from depending on heavy crude as well as from increasing demand for light crude oil products are assessed. This paper, which is based on the initial research proposal, presents the problem under study in a conceptual framework. Relevant concepts, facts, and theories as well as, relationships among them and their bearings on the problem have been identified and discussed. However, the levels of significance of the relationships and the bearings can only be addressed at later stages of this research. The nature of the information and date required are perceivable from the body of this paper. However, they are more explicitly presented in form of a questionnaire which is attached as appendix I. Briefly, they relate to the following (I) coal supply situation: (2) crude oil supply situation; and (3) substitution feasibility factors. Three observations may be, briefly, made regarding some important considerations underlying the problem under study. The first is that regarding coal/fuel oil substitution per se (as applies to other inter-fuel substitution) the issue, traditionally, originates from demand management requirements, on the supply side of energy system. Kenya may be subjected to coal/fuel oil substitution which is necessitated by changes in crude oil quality, the extent of which depends on factors relating to: future crude oil product demand as well as energy, demand pattern and trends; refinery technology; and rate at which the crude oil quality would change. Contrary to some people's beliefs, the current <b>domestic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> supply/demand situation may only be a necessary, but definitely not a sufficient, basis for evaluating {{the extent to which the}} country is likely to be subjected to this type of substitution. Neither would a partial dynamic, analysis of the supply/demand situation provide an adequate basis.
