5|$|Shishupala, {{the king}} of Chedi and Rukmi are the kings under emperor Jarasandha. All three <b>have</b> <b>deep</b> hatred towards Krishna. Jarasandha proposes that Rukmi should marry his sister, Rukmini, to Shishupala, unaware that she {{is in love with}} Krishna. Narada acts as the {{mediator}} between the love couple. After a brief courtship, Rukmini elopes with Krishna. Rukmi tries to stop Krishna and challenges him to a fight. Krishna easily defeats him, and grants his wife - Rukmini's wish by keeping him alive. He however shaves half of his hair to add insult to the injury.|$|E
5|$|Surgery (by craniotomy, open brain surgery) may {{be offered}} {{based on the}} risks of {{treatment}} {{as determined by the}} Spetzlerâ€“Martin scale (grade I-V); this score is higher in larger lesions that are close to important brain structures and <b>have</b> <b>deep</b> venous drainage. High grade lesions (IV and V) have an unacceptably high risk and surgery is not typically offered in those cases. Radiosurgery (using targeted radiation therapy such as by a gamma knife) may be used if the lesion is small but close to vital structures. Finally, embolization may be used on small lesions that have only a single feeding vessel.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{beliefs and}} uses for slow lorises vary, and many {{practices}} appear to <b>have</b> <b>deep</b> roots going {{back at least}} 300years. Oral traditions suggest these practices go back even further. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, {{it was reported that}} the people from the interior of the island of Borneo believed that slow lorises were the gatekeepers for the heavens and that each person had a personal slow loris waiting for them in the afterlife. More often, however, slow lorises are used in traditional medicine or to ward off evil.|$|E

Four of the state's universities, the Baylor Bears, Texas Longhorns, TCU Horned Frogs, and Texas Tech Red Raiders, compete in the Big 12 Conference. The Texas A Aggies left the Big 12 and joined the Southeastern Conference in 2012, which led the Big 12 to invite TCU to join; TCU was previously in the Mountain West Conference. The Houston Cougars and the SMU Mustangs compete in the American Athletic Conference. The Texas State Bobcats and the UT Arlington Mavericks compete in the Sun Belt Conference. Four of the state's schools claim at least one national championship in football: the Texas Longhorns, the Texas A Aggies, the TCU Horned Frogs, and the SMU Mustangs.|$|E
5|$|In fact, tadpoles {{developing}} in ponds and streams are typically herbivorous. Pond tadpoles tend to <b>have</b> <b>deep</b> bodies, large caudal fins and small mouths; they {{swim in the}} quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation. Stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths, shallow bodies and caudal fins; they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of algae and bacteria. They also feed on diatoms, filtered from the water through the gills, and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond, ingesting edible fragments. They have a relatively long, spiral-shaped gut {{to enable them to}} digest this diet. Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles and fish. Young of the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) can occasionally be cannibalistic, the younger tadpoles attacking a larger, more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people of}} the {{district}} follow the traditions, customs and rituals. The district has many temples of Hindu gods and goddesses, which are ancient and <b>have</b> <b>deep</b> spiritualism attached to them. The people of Dakshina Kannada worship the serpent god Subramanya. According to legend, the district was reclaimed by Parashurama from the sea. Nagaradhane or snake worship is practiced according to the popular belief of the Naga Devatha to go underground and guard the species on the top. Rituals such as Bhuta Kola are performed to satisfy the spirits. Kambala, a form of buffalo race on muddy track in the paddy field, is organised in the 16 sites across the district. Cock fight (Kori Katta in Tulu) is another past time of the rural agrarian people.|$|E

5|$|Plants {{and animals}} {{living in the}} desert need special adaptations {{to survive in the}} harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, {{water-resistant}} cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die {{in the course of a}} few weeks after rainfall while other long-lived plants survive for years and <b>have</b> <b>deep</b> root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again when the rare rains fall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.|$|E

An indicator of a better functioning environment is newly sprouting diversity of plants and a return or increase of wildlife.|$|E

When calling, a tinamou extends its neck vertically, tilts its head at an angle, and opens its bill wide. A bird, when flushed, will utter a sharp trill.|$|E
