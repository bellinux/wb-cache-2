40|$|In this paper, {{time-varying}} {{volatility of}} some of the leading <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>funds</b> are studied. The ARMA mean equation with GARCH errors is used to model the series correlations and the conditional heteroscadesticity in the asset returns. The conditional distributions of the standardized residuals are assumed to be skew-generalized error distribution. The high kurtosis and fat tail of the returns, were captured in all the data by fitting an ARMA-GARCH model with the conditional distribution of, skew-generalized error distribution. Furthermore, the sample cross-correlations of these significant <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>funds</b> and the corresponding financial indices they mimic were computed. The empirical conclusion was that, the <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>funds</b> have statistical behavior {{similar to that of the}} corresponding financial indices that they mimic. ^ Keywords: <b>Exchange-Traded</b> <b>Funds,</b> GARCH, Generalized Error Distribution...|$|R

25|$|Hedge {{funds are}} {{structured}} to avoid most direct regulation (although their managers may be regulated) {{and are not}} required to publicly disclose their investment activities, except to the extent that investors generally are subject to disclosure requirements. This is in contrast to a regulated mutual fund or <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>fund,</b> which will typically have to meet regulatory requirements for disclosure. An investor in a hedge fund usually has direct access to the investment adviser of the fund, and may enjoy more personalized reporting than investors in retail investment funds. This may include detailed discussions of risks assumed and significant positions. However, this high level of disclosure is not available to non-investors, contributing to hedge funds' reputation for secrecy, while some hedge funds have very limited transparency even to investors.|$|E

2500|$|An <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>fund</b> (ETF) is an {{investment}} fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. An ETF holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and generally operates with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep it trading close to its net asset value, although deviations can occasionally occur. Most ETFs track an index, such as a stock index or bond index. ETFs may be attractive as investments because of their low costs, tax efficiency, and stock-like features. By 2013, ETFs had become the most popular type of exchange-traded product.|$|E

40|$|PurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the factors that impact the <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>funds</b> net fund flow changes on a daily basis. Design/methodology/approachA total of 1, 212 different <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>funds</b> with a proprietary daily net fund flow data and logistic regressions were studied because the majority of the 1, 212 <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>funds</b> have mostly zero daily net fund flow changes. FindingsIt was documented that in the period December 22, 2005 to July 28, 2010 autocorrelation at the daily frequency is not universally present for the 1, 212 <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>funds</b> that we study, despite the fact that this is the case in the monthly data documented in prior studies. No support was found for the feedback trading hypothesis but some support was found for the contrarian investor hypothesis on daily basis, even though the opposite is ascertained for both in the prior literature monthly data. Also, it cannot be concluded that tracking error prompts net fund flow changes and thus arbitrage activity. Originality/valueThe paper contributes to the ongoing analysis of the factors influencing investment companies fund flow changes, which has mostly focused on open-end funds and monthly data so far. Considering the increased scope and relevance of <b>exchange-traded</b> <b>funds</b> in today’s financial markets, this study fills a void in the fund flow changes literature...|$|R
