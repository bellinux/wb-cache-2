40|$|Deep Reinforcement Learning {{methods have}} {{achieved}} {{state of the}} art performance in learning control policies for the games in the Atari 2600 domain. One of the important parameters in the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) is the <b>frame</b> <b>skip</b> rate. It decides the granularity at which agents can control game play. A <b>frame</b> <b>skip</b> value of $k$ allows the agent to repeat a selected action $k$ number of times. The current {{state of the art}} architectures like Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Dueling Network Architectures (DuDQN) consist of a framework with a static <b>frame</b> <b>skip</b> rate, where the action output from the network is repeated for a fixed number of frames regardless of the current state. In this paper, we propose a new architecture, Dynamic <b>Frame</b> <b>skip</b> Deep Q-Network (DFDQN) which makes the <b>frame</b> <b>skip</b> rate a dynamic learnable parameter. This allows us to choose the number of times an action is to be repeated based on the current state. We show empirically that such a setting improves the performance on relatively harder games like Seaquest.

40|$|Abstract. Frame rate up-conversion (FRUC) is {{a useful}} {{technique}} {{for a lot of}} practical applications, such as display format conversion, low bitrate video coding and slow motion playback. Unlike traditional approaches, such as frame repetition or linear frame interpolation, motion-compensated frame interpolation (MCFI) technique which takes block motion into account is regarded as a more efficient scheme. By considering the deficiencies in previous works, new criteria and coding schemes for improving motion derivation and interpolation processes are suggested. We then integrate the proposed MCFI scheme into the decoding process of the latest coding standard, H. 264 /AVC. In addition, adaptive <b>frame</b> <b>skip</b> is fulfilled at the encoder side to maximize the power of MCFI in video coding applications. As a result, the encoder can adopt the MCFI dynamically and can decide whether the input frame should be coded or dropped then interpolated.

40|$|A {{deterministic}} service model {{assisted by}} a sufficiently large playback buffer space can provide bounded delay guarantees for video packets and simplify network resource management. However, many popular mobile terminals {{do not have}} sufficient memory capacity for deterministic video services since the embedded memory is limited {{and needs to be}} shared by numerous software programs and masses of personal data. This paper improves the traditional deterministic modeling approach for delivering pre-stored videos to mobile clients with QoS guarantees. The limitation of playback buffer space, the network delay jitter, the processing load of resource management, and the QoS guarantee are considered in the proposed mechanism. Some traffic smoothing operations are integrated into the proposed mechanism for reducing the playback buffer demand and data rate variation. This paper further proposes a smart video <b>frame</b> <b>skip</b> algorithm, originating at the sender for preventing possible overflow problems due to insufficient playback buffer space. The algorithm can determine the most suitable temporal range for skipping frames and prevent arbitrary discarding from inappropriate video frames such as I-frames on the client side.

30|$|To improve {{flexibility}} in bit allocation, some rate control algorithms adjust frame rate or spatial resolution. When the frame rate decreases, additional bits can be allocated to each frame and frame image quality can be improved. However, frame skipping {{should be done}} very carefully because motion artifacts such as flickering or motion jerkiness may degrade subjective video quality. In [21, 22], the decision for the <b>frame</b> <b>skip</b> is based on buffer fullness and the spatial and temporal quality of the video. In [23], the similarity between successive frames measured by the PSNR is used to skip frames adaptively. To optimize coding performance, frames to be skipped are determined based on an R-D model [24, 25], but these works cannot be used in real-time applications. In [26 – 28], motion artifacts are reduced by adjusting the frame rate gradually based on the motion activity of the previous sub-GOP which is expressed by the histogram of difference image, thereby preserving motion smoothness. Even though a number of previous works have contributed to frame rate controls, the effect of providing bitrate control through frame rate adjustment is somewhat limited because, to avoid motion artifacts, the frame rate cannot be reduced below a certain value. In addition, temporal scalability may not be very effective for increasing subjective quality by temporal to spatial bitrate exchange. This is because the quality degradation due to dropping a frame is easily perceived, especially in low frame rate communications such as that used in two-way multimedia communication for mobile devices [29].|$|E

Qualities of Services (QoS) approaches, such as video <b>frame</b> <b>skipping</b> techniques, are thus attractive to address the problem. Many conventional video frame-skipping techniques focus on the system-centric quality attributes to adjust the quality of video delivery. They normally ignore the user-centric quality attributes. A usercentric approach, amongst others, is to take human perception in consideration and adapt the video quality expressed in patterns of Group of Pictures (GoP). In a post-processing step of an encoding stage, it filters and re-titles the qualitymatching patterns from the rest. It then reconstructs the filtered GoP according to the H. 264 format.

Methods: RET analysis was performed in constitutive and/or somatic DNA by direct sequencing. TA cloning was performed to characterize new mutations and deletions. Site-directed mutagenesis, focus formation and soft agar assays were performed to test in vitro the activity of new mutations. The Align GVGD program was employed for the in silico analysis. Results: we identified 3 new RET alterations. The first was a 7 bp “somatic” in frame deletion in exon 11 encompassing codon 629 - 631. The second showed the simultaneous presence of a “somatic” E 616 Q mutation in exon 10 and a “somatic” C 630 G mutation in exon 11 on different alleles. Moreover, in the same patient, we found an alternative splicing causing the in <b>frame</b> <b>skip</b> of exon 10 in the allele carrying the C 630 G mutation. The third alteration was a new “germline” mutation (E 632 K, exon 11) and was found in an apparently sporadic MTC. According to the in vitro and in silico tests, both E 616 Q and E 632 K RET mutations were not transforming while the C 630 G RET mutation showed a high transforming activity. Conclusions: 1) RET genetic screening should be performed by sequencing analysis in all MTC patients to detect also new RET mutations that would be missed when looking only at the “hot spot” mutations; 2) all new mutations must be evaluated by in silico and/or in vitro analysis to define their transforming ability since {{in some cases they}} may be inactive mutations...|$|E

In the proposed scheme, the access point (AP) basically allocates transmission opportunity (TXOP) for each station in a service interval (SI) like the reference scheduler of the IEEE 802. 11 e standard, which {{is referred to}} as the TGe scheme in this paper. In the proposed scheme, however, the AP calculates the number of MAC service data units (MSDUs) arrived in an SI, considering the inter-arrival time of audio samples and that of video frames, which are referred to as media units (MUs), at the application layer. The AP then gives additional TXOP duration in the SI to stations which had audio or video MAC protocol data units (MPDUs) in their source buffers at the end of the previous TXOP. In addition, utilizing video frame information from the application layer, we propose video <b>frame</b> <b>skipping</b> at the MAC-level of a source station.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new frame-skipping transcoding approach for video combiners in multipoint video conferencing. Transcoding {{is regarded as}} a process of converting a previously compressed video bitstream into a lower bitrate bitstream. A high transcoding ratio may result in an unacceptable picture quality when the incoming video bitstream is transcoded with the full <b>frame</b> rate. <b>Frame</b> <b>skipping</b> is often used as an efficient scheme to allocate more bits to representative frames, so that an acceptable quality for each frame can be maintained. However, the <b>skipped</b> <b>frame</b> must be decompressed completely, and should act as the reference frame to the nonskipped frame for reconstruction. The newly quantized DCT coefficients of prediction error need to be recomputed for the nonskipped frame with reference to the previous nonskipped frame; this can create an undesirable complexity in the real time application as well as introduce re-encoding error. A new frame-skipping transcoding architecture for improved picture quality and reduced complexity is proposed. The proposed architecture is mainly performed on the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain to achieve a low complexity transcoder. It is observed that the re-encoding error is avoided at the frame-skipping transcoder when the strategy of direct summation of DCT coefficients is employed. By using the proposed frame-skipping transcoder and dynamically allocating more frames to the active participants in video combining, we are able to make more uniform peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) performance of the subsequences and the video qualities of the active subsequences can be improved significantly.
