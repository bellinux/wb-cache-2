5|$|The NWA World Tag Team Championship was {{defended by}} AMW, who were {{accompanied}} by Gail Kim, against The Naturals in the sixth bout on the card. The duration of the contest was 10 minutes and 37 seconds. Douglas' head was busted open during the match, causing him to bleed from the forehead throughout. The Naturals got a two-count on Harris after they performed AMW's signature <b>Death</b> <b>Sentence</b> maneuver on him by slamming him back-first into the mat while jumping on his throat. Kim interfered in the bout by distracting The Naturals, which allowed Storm to bash Douglas over the head and then handcuff him to the ring-barrier. AMW followed by performing the <b>Death</b> <b>Sentence</b> on Stevens and pinning him to remain champions.|$|E
5|$|Because Andrew Wilson {{was given}} a <b>death</b> <b>sentence,</b> his case was not {{reviewable}} on the same grounds by the Appellate Court, and it {{went directly to the}} Illinois Supreme Court. In April 1987, the Supreme Court overturned Andrew's conviction with a ruling that his confession had been coerced involuntarily from him while under duress. It ordered a new trial.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} 2010 the {{government}} reports that 46 people were under <b>sentence</b> of <b>death</b> and six new <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> were imposed during the year. Amnesty International reports nine new <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> in 2010.|$|R

50|$|Since being <b>sentenced</b> to <b>death</b> in 1997, Wallace {{has been}} {{appealing}} to the courts to overturn the <b>death</b> <b>sentences,</b> stating that his confessions were coerced and his constitutional rights were violated in the process. The North Carolina Supreme Court upheld the <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> in 2000. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2001 denied his appeal. In 2005, Superior Court Judge Charles Lamm rejected Wallace's latest appeal to overturn his convictions and nine <b>death</b> <b>sentences.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{a series}} of appeals, defense {{attorneys}} presented mitigating evidence of the troubled upbringing of Gardner, who had spent nearly his entire adult life in incarceration.

Gardner's legal team took the case {{all the way to}} the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to intervene.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, several groups are {{demanding}} that Jamila be given the <b>death</b> <b>sentence.</b> One male guard, (Surya Saputra), takes pity on Jamila and tries to help her.

25|$|Coleman had {{received}} two <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> from Ohio, and one apiece from Illinois and Indiana. At {{the time of}} his execution, he was the only condemned person in the United States to have <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> in three states.|$|R
50|$|Before 1973, the District of Columbia was {{exclusively}} {{governed by}} the United States Congress, which included establishing all local laws. Until 1962, D.C. was the last jurisdiction in the United States with mandatory <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> for first-degree murder (the last state with mandatory <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> for first degree murder was Vermont). Mandatory <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> were abolished by the HR5143 (PL87-423), {{signed into law by}} President John F. Kennedy on March 22, 1962. Rape was also a capital offense.|$|R
50|$|In response, General Lucius Clay {{commuted}} {{six more}} <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> to life imprisonment. But {{he refused to}} commute the six remaining <b>death</b> <b>sentences,</b> including Peiper's, though the executions were postponed.

5|$|On November 8, 2010, {{the jury}} {{returned}} with a recommendation that Hayes be executed. The jury recommended a <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> {{on each of the}} six capital felony counts for which Hayes was convicted.

5|$|A <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> had to {{be passed}} unanimously, and {{confirmed}} in writing by various officers as the verdict passed up the chain of command. A man's battalion and brigade commander tended to comment on his own record, but senior generals {{tended to be more}} concerned with the type of offence and the state of discipline in that unit. The Judge Advocate General at GHQ also checked the records for irregularities, before final confirmation (or otherwise) by the Commander-in-Chief of the relevant theatre.|$|E
5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) {{defended the}} NWA World Tag Team Championship against Team Canada (Eric Young and Petey Williams), who were {{accompanied}} by A-1, in a Six Sides of Steel Strap match next. It lasted 14 minutes even. In a strap match, wrestlers are attached by a strap {{for the duration of}} the match, but they mainly used it as a weapon. AMW retained the titles after forcing Williams into the mat by performing their signature maneuver, the <b>Death</b> <b>Sentence.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} years after WWII, <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> were passed in large numbers daily on collaborationists and war criminals, {{but also on the}} „enemies of the people“, i.e. all those who opposed the new {{communist}} regime. There are no reliable data, but it seems likely that in Yugoslavia until 1951 there were as many as 10,000 <b>death</b> <b>sentences,</b> a majority of which were executed. In the same period, there must have been several thousands of <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> and executions in Serbia. In addition to political offenses, capital crimes included the theft of the government property, as well as aggravated murder and robbery. Until 1959, executions were either by shooting or by hanging, as determined by the sentence of the court in each individual case, although hangings were considered as an aggravated form and were used less frequently. In the first post-war years, executions of major war criminals were often public. After 1950, the number of <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> fell sharply. According to the official statistics, from 1950 to 1958 there were 229 <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> in Yugoslavia (ca. 29 p.a.) and 122 in Serbia (ca. 15 p.a.). No official data were published on executions, but it is safe to assume that about two thirds of all <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> were executed.|$|R

5|$|In 1584 Báthory allowed Zamoyski {{to execute}} Samuel Zborowski, whose <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> for treason and murder had been pending for roughly a decade. This {{political}} conflict between Báthory and the Zborowski family, framed as {{the clash between}} the monarch and the nobility, {{would be a major}} recurring controversy in internal Polish politics for many years. In external politics, Báthory was considering another war with Russia, but his plans were delayed to the lack of support from the Sejm, which refused to pass requested tax raises.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, U.S. {{federal judge}} Tena Campbell {{rejected}} Gardner's appeal that his attorneys were inadequate {{because they were}} unable to prove that he did not mean to kill his victim. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected motions for appeal by his defense on March 8, 2010. Gardner attempted to give up the process at least three times, but his attorneys convinced him to continue appealing each time. State court Judge Robin Reese signed an execution warrant on April 23 ordering the state to carry out the <b>death</b> <b>sentence.</b>|$|E
5|$|In June 1583 Zamoyski {{took his}} third wife, Gryzelda Bathory, a {{relative}} of king Bathory himself. In May 1584 Zamoyski's men captured Samuel Zborowski, a noble whose <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> for treason and murder had been pending for roughly a decade, shortly afterwards with Bathory's consent Zborowski was executed. This political conflict between Báthory, Zamoyski and the Zborowski family, framed as the clash between the monarch and the nobility, {{would be a major}} recurring controversy in internal Polish politics for many years, beginning with a major dispute at the Sejm of 1585.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> rose sharply under Freisler's rule. Approximately 90% of all {{proceedings}} that came before him received <b>sentences</b> of <b>death</b> or life imprisonment, the sentences frequently having been determined before the trial. Between 1942 and 1945, more than 5,000 <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> were decreed by him, 2,600 of these through the court's First Senate, which Freisler controlled. He was responsible in his {{three years on}} the court for as many <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> as all other senate sessions of the court combined in the court's existence between 1934 and 1945.|$|R
