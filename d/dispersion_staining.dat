40|$|Interferon- (IFN-) λ 1 is {{regarded}} as a potent bio-active molecule in innate immunity. However, little is known about its role in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). We therefore investigated expression of IFN-λ 1 in CSU, its cellular location, and its influence on inflammatory cell accumulation by using flow cytometry analysis, skin tissue <b>dispersion,</b> immunohistochemical <b>stain,</b> and a mouse peritoneal inflammation model. The results showed that level of IFN-λ 1 was 2. 0 -fold higher in plasma of the patients with CSU than the level in healthy control (HC) subjects. Among leukocytes examined, only CD 8 + T cells expressed more IFN-λ 1 in CSU blood. Double labeling immunohistochemical staining revealed that IFN-λ 1 + inflammatory cells such as mast cells, eosinophils, B cells, neutrophils, and macrophages were mainly located in dermis, whereas epidermis tissue highly expressed IFN-λ 1. IFN-λ 1 induced a dose-dependent increase in number of eosinophils, lymphocytes, mast cells, macrophages, and neutrophils in the peritoneum of mice at 6 [*]h following injection, which was inhibited by pretreatment of the animals with anti-intercellular adhesion molecule- (ICAM-) 1 and/or anti-L-selectin antibodies. In conclusion, IFN-λ 1 is likely {{to play a role in}} the pathogenesis of CSU. Blocking IFN-λ 1 production may help to reduce the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the involved CSU skin...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Thyrotroph {{embryonic}} factor (TEF), {{a member}} of the PAR bZIP family of transcriptional regulators, has been involved in neurotransmitter homeostasis, amino acid metabolism, and regulation of apoptotic proteins. In spite of its relevance, nothing is known about the regulation of TEF. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: p 53 -dependent genotoxic agents {{have been shown to be}} much more harmful for PAR bZIP-deficient mice as compared to wild type animals. Here we demonstrate that TEF expression is controlled by p 53 through upregulation of microRNA- 125 b, as determined by both regulating the activity of p 53 and transfecting cells with microRNA- 125 b precursors. We also describe a novel role for TEF in controlling actin distribution and cell shape in mouse fibroblasts. Lack of TEF is accompanied by dramatic increase of cell area and decrease of elongation (bipolarity) and <b>dispersion</b> (multipolarity). <b>Staining</b> of actin cytoskeleton also showed that TEF (-/-) cells are characterized by appearance of circumferential actin bundles and disappearance of straight fibers. Interestingly, transfection of TEF (-/-) fibroblasts with TEF induced a wild type-like phenotype. Consistent with our previous findings, transfection of wild type fibroblasts with miR- 125 b promoted a TEF (-/-) -like phenotype, and a similar but weaker effect was observed following exogenous expression of p 53. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings provide the first evidence of TEF regulation, through a miR- 125 b-mediated pathway, and describes a novel role of TEF in the maintenance of cell shape in fibroblasts...|$|R
30|$|We first {{generated}} HTC 75 cells stably expressing wildtype PLIN 3 and phosphorylation mutants of PLIN 3 (S/T to A or D) (Fig. S 7 A). S/T to A mutations disrupt AMPK phosphorylation of PLIN 3 {{and led to}} LD clustering {{rather than}} dispersion in > 85 % of the cells (Figs.  2 C and S 7 B), whereas S/T to D mutations mimic AMPK phosphorylation and resulted in increased LD dispersion with ~ 62.5 % of the cells expressing the double mutant (PLIN 3 S 31 D/T 216 D) displaying LD <b>dispersion.</b> When we <b>stained</b> glucose-depleted cells expressing wildtype PLIN 3 vs. double phosphorylation site mutants, LD dispersion could be observed in both control and WT PLIN 3 -expressing cells (Figs.  2 D and S 8). Notably, LD dispersion was completely abolished in S 31 A/T 216 A expressing cells, while increased LD dispersion was evident in S 31 D/T 216 D expressing cells. These observations suggest that PLIN 3 -mediated regulation of LD dynamics is modulated by AMPK phosphorylation at residues S 31 and T 216.|$|R

40|$|Suspensions of microswimmers are a {{rich source}} of {{fascinating}} new fluid mechanics. Recently we predicted the active pipe flow dispersion of gyrotactic microalgae, whose orientation is biased by gravity and flow shear. Analytical theory predicts that these active swimmers disperse in a markedly distinct manner from passive tracers (Taylor dispersion). Dispersing swimmers display nonzero drift and effective diffusivity that is non-monotonic with Péclet number. Such predictions agree with numerical simulations, but hitherto have not been tested experimentally. Here, to facilitate comparison, we obtain new solutions of the axial dispersion theory accounting both for swimmer negative buoyancy and a local nonlinear response of swimmers to shear, provided by two alternative microscopic stochastic descriptions. We obtain new predictions for suspensions of the model swimming alga Dunaliella salina, whose motility and buoyant mass we parametrise using tracking video microscopy. We then present a new experimental method to measure gyrotactic <b>dispersion</b> using fluorescently <b>stained</b> D. salina and provide a preliminary comparison with predictions of a nonzero drift above the mean flow for each microscopic stochastic description. Finally, we propose further experiments for a full experimental characterisation of gyrotactic dispersion measures and discuss implications of our results for algal dispersion in industrial photobioreactors.

40|$|The ATP-induced Ca 2 + {{accumulation}} {{efficiency and}} rates of Ca 2 + uptake of the reconstituted sarcoplasmic reticulum (RSR) model membrane system were measured over an extended range of lipid-to-protein (L/P) molar ratios and were compared to those of isolated light sarcoplasmic reticulum (LSR). Highly purified sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), dissociated {{in the presence of}} deoxycholate, was reconstituted for several L/P ratios, according to the same procedure, forming closed membranes vesicles composed of greater than 95 % Ca 2 + pump protein and SR lipids which were capable of ATP-induced Ca 2 + accumulation in the absence of oxalate or other Ca 2 + precipitating agents. This suggests that dissociation of SR and reconstitution to form RSR does not significantly affect the ability of the Ca 2 + pump protein incorporated into the SR lipid bilayer to establish Ca 2 + gradients. Electron micrographs of fixed and <b>stained</b> <b>dispersions</b> of RSR revealed a structural organization of the membrane that was dependent upon the L/P molar ratio. RSR with L/P greater than 88 were composed of closed vesicles whose membranes stained asymmetrically, similar to that observed for LSR. Closed vesicles of RSR with L/P less than 88 were composed of membrane that stained symmetrically. In addition, reconstituted SR preparations with well-defined L/P molar ratios greater than 88 possess a functional behavior similar to that of LSR (in the absence of oxalate, energy efficiencies are 60 - 70 % and apparent initial uptake rates are 80 % that of isolated LSR controls); RSR preparations with L/P less than 88 are characterized by significantly depressed values of the energy efficiencies and apparent initial uptake rates especially at low L/P ratios. Thus, we are the first to report a reconstituted SR model membrane system capable of attaining rates of Ca 2 + uptake comparable to isolated LSR controls at comparable L/P ratios in the absence of oxalate or other Ca 2 + precipitating agents...|$|R

5000|$|Phase {{contrast}} <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> {{requires that}} a phase contrast objective {{with the appropriate}} phase annulus in the substage condenser be used to see the effect. It {{takes advantage of the}} fact that the rays of light that are not shifted in phase by the presence of the object are separated from the phase shifted rays at the back focal plane of the objective. [...] These unaffected rays are then significantly decreased in intensity. With “Positive Phase Contrast”, the particle appears colored from the contributing wavelengths for which the mounting medium has the higher refractive index. Because of the physical size of the phase plate and its image onto the back focal plane of the objective where it is modified, a halo is formed around the particle. This halo takes on the color of the combined wavelengths for which the particle has the higher refractive index. The colors seen with this type of <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> are about the same as those with the Becke` Line method shown in Chart 1. Examples of this type of <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> and the colors shown for different λo’s can be seen at the microlabgallery.com site for Phase Contrast <b>Dispersion</b> <b>Staining.</b> The presence of two colors helps to bracket the wavelength at which the refractive index matches for the two materials.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technical}} literature {{had little}} additional discussion of dispersion effects until 1948. That year S. C. Crossmon, N. B. Dodge, and co-authors R. C. Emmons and R. N. Gates all wrote {{papers on the}} use of dispersion effects through the microscope to characterize particles. [...] Crossmon seems to have coined the term “Dispersion Staining” as any optical technique that used the “Christiansen Effect” to produce color in the image of colorless particles. [...] He demonstrated the use of Becke` Line, Oblique Illumination, Darkfield, and Phase Contrast <b>Dispersion</b> <b>Staining</b> methods. S. C. Crossmon and W. C. McCrone have published numerous papers {{on the use of}} objective back focal plane stop <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> techniques since that time. Yu. A. Cherkasov published an excellent paper on this topic in 1958 and it was translated into English in 1960. [...] Well over 100 papers have been written on the various methods of <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> and their application since about 1950 and most of these since 1960.|$|E

50|$|Objective stop <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> takes {{advantage}} of the fact that all light unaltered by the presence of particles in the field of view is focused at the back focal plane of the objective. If the substage condenser iris is closed down then all of the direct light is focused into a small image of the opening in the substage condenser iris at the back focal plane of the objective. If an opaque stop is place at that position then all of the direct light is blocked and the image of the particle is made up by the wavelengths at which the particles and the mounting liquid do not match. These colors are basically the same as the colors seen when using darkfield <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining.</b> The double aperturing of this method enhances the color effect but also sacrifices resolution of the particles. In fields of view where particles may be stacked or in very close proximity {{it may be difficult to}} be sure which small particle is actually producing the color. Examples of this type of <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> and the colors shown for different λo’s can be seen at the microlabgallery.com site for Objective Stop <b>Dispersion</b> <b>Staining.</b> This method is more difficult to interpret due to the single color rather than two bracketing colors but is relatively accurate near the center of the visible range.|$|E

50|$|Darkfield {{illumination}} <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> is {{the result}} of the image of the particle being formed only by the light that is refracted while all the direct light impinging on the specimen is oriented at such an angle that it misses the front lens of the objective. The result is that the background is black. All of the features of objects in the field of view that don’t match the refractive index of the mounting medium appear as bright white. When a particle is mounted in a liquid that matches its refractive index somewhere in the visible wavelengths then those wavelengths are not refracted by the particle and are not collected by the objective. The image of the object is formed by all of the wavelengths that remain. These wavelengths combine to produce a single color that can be used to indicate which band of wavelengths are missing (see Chart 2). Examples of this type of <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> and the colors shown for different λo’s can be seen at the microlabgallery.com site for Darkfield <b>Dispersion</b> <b>Staining.</b> This method is more difficult to interpret due to the single color rather than two bracketing colors but is relatively accurate near the center of the visible range.|$|E
50|$|Oblique {{illumination}} <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> is {{the result}} of refraction and the convex shape of most particles. With oblique illumination the beam of light illuminating the sample is directed at an oblique angle through the sample. This enhances the resolution of structural details in the particle that are oriented at right angles to the incident beam of light while sacrificing some of the resolution of features parallel to the direction of the beam. Because of this orientation of the beam the relative refractive index of the particle and the mounting liquid becomes apparent. The wavelengths for which the liquid has the higher refractive index are refracted into the front lens of the objective {{from the side of the}} particle nearest the side from which the light is coming. If the particle has a higher refractive index for all visible wavelengths then this side of the particle is dark. The side farthest from the source of the light shows all the wavelengths for which the particle has the higher refractive index. These effects are seen with the particle in sharp focus. This is a significant advantage over the Becke` line method because the particle doesn’t have to be defocus to see the colors and generally the colors are more distinct than are the Becke` line dispersion colors. The colors seen with this type of <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> are about the same as those with the Becke` Line method shown in Chart 1. Examples of this type of <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> and the colors shown for different λo’s can be seen at microlabgallery.com site for Becke` Line <b>Dispersion</b> <b>Staining.</b> The presence of two colors helps to bracket the wavelength at which the refractive index matches for the two materials.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> is an {{analytical}} technique used in light microscopy that {{takes advantage of}} the differences in the dispersion curve of the refractive index of an unknown material relative to a standard material with a known dispersion curve to identify or characterize that unknown material. These differences become manifest as a color when the two dispersion curves intersect for some visible wavelength. This is an optical staining technique and requires no stains or dyes to produce the color. Its primary use today is in the confirmation of the presence of asbestos in construction materials but it has many other applications.|$|E
50|$|The Becke' Line {{method of}} <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> is {{primarily}} {{used as an}} exploratory technique. As a particle field is scanned and the fine focus is constantly adjusted and flash of color around or in a particle is noted {{and one of the}} other methods can be used to sharpen the sensitivity in determining the matching wavelength. For large particles (greater than 25 micrometers in diameter) the colored Becke` Lines may be sufficiently distinct to determine the lo with the required accuracy. For very large particles (greater than 100 micrometers) this may be the best method because it is least sensitive to other types of optical interferences.|$|E
50|$|When the {{conditions}} for <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> are met (the particle is mounted in a liquid with a matching refractive index in the visible range of wavelengths but with a very different refractive index) then the particle has a high refractive index in the red part of the spectrum and a lower refractive index in the blue. This is because liquids {{tend to have a}} steeper dispersion curve than colorless solids. As a result, when the particle is dropped out of focus the red wavelengths are focused inward. For the blue wavelengths the particle behaves like a concave lens and the blue Becke` Line moves out into the liquid.|$|E
50|$|The {{dispersion}} of the refractive index {{is a fundamental}} property of matter. It may {{be thought of as}} the result of the relative proximity of the harmonic frequencies of the outer shell electrons in a compound to the frequencies of visible light. The harmonic frequency of the bonding electron is the result of the energy of that bond. If the bond is very strong the frequency will be very high. The higher the frequency the less effect the difference in frequencies from blue to red will have on the refractive index. For the relatively high energy bonds in most inorganic solids this means their refractive indices change very little over the visible range of frequencies. The refractive indices of organic compounds on the other hand, with their lower bonding energies, change significantly over the visible range. This difference in dispersion is the basis of the Christiansen effect and the <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> methods.|$|E
50|$|The {{color of}} these two bands of light will vary {{depending}} on where the particle and liquid match in refractive index, the location of λo. If the match is near the blue {{end of the spectrum}} then the Becke' Line moving into the particle will contain nearly all of the visible wavelengths except blue and will appear as a pale yellow. The Becke` Line moving out will appear a very dark blue. If the match is near the red end of the spectrum then the Becke` Line moving into the particle will appear dark red and the Becke` Line moving out will appear pale blue. If the λo is near the middle of the visible wavelengths then the Becke` Line moving into the particle will be orange and the Becke` Line moving out will be sky blue. The colors seen (see Chart 1) can be used to very precisely determine the refractive index of the unknown or confirm the identity of the unknown, {{as in the case of}} asbestos identification. Examples of this type of <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> and the colors shown for different λo’s can be seen at http://microlabgallery.com/gallery-dsbecke.aspx. The presence of two colors helps to bracket the wavelength at which the refractive index matches for the two materials.|$|E

Wavelengths or indices of refraction may be determined at right angles to and parallel to fiber axes. This method is rapid and sensitive for identification purposes. There is a great need for a dependable, sensitive and rapid method for the detection and identification of asbestos. Microscopical <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> satisfies all of these requirements. It is dependable because {{it is based on the}} measurement of three refractive indices as well as the dispersion of those indices. Refractive indices are among the most valuable identifying characteristics for small particles. The method is sensitive because the refractive indices are "read " as bright <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> colors against a black background. These colors can be observed on particles well below 1 Am in diameter. It is rapid because any particle in the microscopical preparation showing the optical properties of asbestos signals its presence by a unique color combination with polarized light. One particle of asbestos in a field of view containing many thousands of other particles will be immediately apparent on scanning the eye across the field of view. Besides optical crystallographic methods like <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining,</b> only differential thermal analysis (DTA) and X-ray diffraction have this ability to tag a particular crystalline phase in a mixture. X-ray diffraction, however, is several orders of magnitude less sensitive than <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> and requires much more time. *McCrone Associate...|$|E

40|$|Although {{there have}} been a number of studies on the {{ingestion}} of asbestos, few studies exist on how the chrysotile asbestos itself is altered by the exposure to the acid stomach environment. This study has found that there are changes in the physical, chemical and surface properties of chrysotile asbestos as a result of exposure to water, strong acids, and simulated gastric juices. It was observed that the charge on the surface (the zeta potential) is changed from positive to negative; the surface becomes silicalike; and the magnesium is lost from the fibers of asbestos upon exposure to water and acid. It was also noted that the smaller the fiber diameter, the faster the loss of the magnesium. Notable among the changes in physical properties is a change in the refractive index. This means that asbestos exposed to acids or water may not be detectable using the <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining</b> techniques that identify asbestos based on the refractive index. Other physical property changes include the destruction of the gross crystallinity of the fibers. The x-ray diffraction signal disappears when fibers are exposed to acid. However, this study shows that the fibers may still be detected by electron diffraction. It appears that upon acid exposure, the magnesium ions are leached out, leaving a magnesium-free silica network. A positive ion, possibly the proton (H +) or the hydronium ion (H 30 +), replaces the lost magnesium ion...|$|E
40|$|Polarized light {{microscopy}} (PLM) {{is a technique}} which employs the use of polarizing filters to obtain substantial optical property information about the material which is being observed. This information can be combined with other microscopy techniques to confirm or elucidate the identity of an unknown material, determine whether a particular contaminant is present (as with asbestos analysis), or to provide important {{information that can be}} used to refine a manufacturing or chemical process. PLM was the major microscopy technique in use for identification of materials for nearly a century since its introduction in 1834 by William Fox Talbot, as other techniques such as SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy), XPD (X-ray Powder Diffraction), and TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) had not yet been developed. Today, it is still the only technique approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for asbestos analysis, and is often the technique first applied for identification of unknown materials. PLM uses different configurations in order to determine different material properties. With each configuration additional clues can be gathered, leading to a conclusion of material identity. With no polarizing filter, the microscope can be used just as a stereo optical microscope, and view qualities such as morphology, size, and number of phases. With a single polarizing filter (single polars), additional properties can be established, such as pleochroism, individual refractive indices, and <b>dispersion</b> <b>staining.</b> With two polarizing filters (crossed polars), even more can be deduced: isotropy vs. anisotropy, extinction angle, birefringence/degree of birefringence, sign of elongation, and anomalous polarization colors, among others. With the use of PLM many of these properties can be determined in a matter of seconds, even for those who are not highly trained. McCrone, a leader in the field of polarized {{light microscopy}}, often advised, If you cant determine a specific optical property of a particle after two minutes, move onto another configuration. Since optical properties can be seen so very quickly and easily under polarized light, it is only necessary to spend a maximum of two minutes on a technique to determine a particular property, though often only a few seconds are required...|$|E
