500|$|There was {{discussion}} among {{the producers of}} the series regarding whether Bertram {{should be included in}} the storyline, as he had not appeared in any episodes for several years. An un-used scene was intended for broadcasting which showed Stewie, while trying to find Waldo in an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog, saying to Brian [...] "Oh, turn to the next page. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>they</b> put him in someone's utility pocket", but it was never used as it was not deemed funny enough for the episode. Originally, Peter singing [...] "Milkshake" [...] to inmates at a prison was going to be naked and push his nipples from underneath, but broadcasting standards objected; as a result, the show broadcast Peter wearing underpants and pushing his nipples from the side. When Peter and Lois are in the restaurant and Peter leaves to [...] "warn the chef of Lois' arrival", Lois was intended to say [...] "If he won't put something in me, I will", but the gag was never broadcast.|$|E

5000|$|O'Grady made a {{deal with}} ITV to present a new Friday night chat show, Paul O'Grady Live. The first series aired for ten episodes from September to November 2010. In October, O'Grady {{attracted}} media attention after using Paul O'Grady Live to criticise the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government for their implementation of mass cuts to social services. He called them [...] "bastards" [...] and proclaimed [...] "Do you know what got my back up? Those Tories hooping and hollering when they heard about the cuts. Gonna scrap the pensions - yeah! - no more wheelchairs - yeah! ... <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> when <b>they</b> were children they laughed in Bambi when his mother got shot." [...] Ofcom received several complaints over the incident, though his Bambi quote was soon after quoted by Peter Taffe at the Socialism 2010 conference. O'Grady also voiced his support for student protesters who had occupied and vandalised the headquarters of the Conservative Party at Millbank Tower on 10 November 2010.|$|R

[...] As the fight continues, Ollie seems to be holding his own until Venom unexpectedly bites off Ollie's left arm and eats it. Ollie is later shown being incarcerated in Prison 42 in the Negative Zone.|$|E
3000|$|... “I’m {{working with}} a {{colleague}} and we’re interested in how the leaf area of a tree scales {{with the amount of}} nitrogen that the tree has. We had data on arctic systems but didn’t have data on tropical systems. I knew that a colleague had measured the amount of leaves basically in a forest down to the tropics. <b>I</b> said ‘I <b>bet</b> <b>they</b> also measured nitrogen,’ so I emailed them and they said ‘yeah, but we never looked at the data before.’ So I took the data and plotted it on the same graph as the arctic data and found a very clear global relationship that we were looking for. That tropical data was already almost 10  years old, it’s pretty much dead, kind of old data. So we were able to look at it in a slightly different way and found something neat. [So what triggers this discovery is] a desire to develop a global level analysis, so you play around your own data, your own site, and then wonder how this scales, you find colleagues who collected in a totally different ecosystem and location, you like ‘hey, do you have this kind of data? You can be a co-author etc.’” [...]...|$|R

60|$|WE went a-fooling {{along for}} a day or two, and then just as the full moon was {{touching}} the ground {{on the other side of}} the desert, we see a string of little black figgers moving across its big silver face. You could see them as plain as if they was painted on the moon with ink. It was another caravan. We cooled down our speed and tagged along after it, just to have company, though it warn't going our way. It was a rattler, that caravan, and a most bully sight to look at next morning when the sun come a-streaming across the desert and flung the long shadders of the camels on the gold sand like a thousand grand-daddy-long-legses marching in procession. We never went very near it, because we knowed better now than to act like that and scare people's camels and break up their caravans. It was the gayest outfit you ever see, for rich clothes and nobby style. Some of the chiefs rode on dromedaries, the first we ever see, and very tall, and they go plunging along like they was on stilts, and they rock the man that is on them pretty violent and churn up his dinner considerable, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you, but <b>they</b> make noble good time, and a camel ain't nowheres with them for speed.|$|R
5000|$|Colbie told Billboard {{she wrote}} this song [...] "thinking, {{what do they}} listen to over here Hawaii at Christmas time? <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>they</b> don't always want to hear songs about white Christmases and {{bundling}} up 'cause it's cold outside.

[...] Caillat teamed up with writing partners Kara DioGuardi and Jason Reeves to craft the bubbly and admittedly silly track, [...] "Kara started coming up with all these funny lyrics about Santa falling off his surf board and Rudolph playing reindeer games on me," [...] she says. [...] "It's such a fun song and really shows a silly side of my personality that most people don't see besides my friends and family." ...|$|E

5000|$|Additionally, Fletcher was {{critical}} of the format change to bootcamp, saying [...] "The show can be cruel for those taking part, brutal for those who don't make the grade, and its fickleness {{is nothing compared to}} the harsh realities of the music industry. However, the argument that 'the music industry is meaner' fell apart this week. ... I refuse to believe that anyone in the music industry has even been given a contract, told they're brilliant and then forced to watch 15 other people sing and have that contract ripped up in front of their faces. And even if they have, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>they</b> didn't have an audience of 4,000 people chanting at them to be on their way. This was reality TV at its most cruel." [...] He wondered if the change was a [...] "desperate attempt to create interest in a series that has performed solidly in the ratings, but without creating any real talking points or memorable moments", and said that [...] "watching Karen Harding, Lydia Lucy and Sheena McHugh get put into the Top 6 and then have the dream of a spot at Judges' Houses snatched away from them felt needlessly mean. Whether the trio deserved to make Judges' Houses or not felt irrelevant. The audience finger-pointing and the chanting of 'Swap! Swap! Swap!' made the whole process terribly ugly." [...] He questioned the show's producers' [...] "need to make it even more vicious", opined that the new twist [...] "definitely undermines the credibility of the show's judges", and said, [...] "The whole twist felt contrived and unpleasant, and I hope it won't be returning in 2014." ...|$|E

40|$|Jack {{was sitting}} at his kitchen table, eating a bowl of Cheerio’s, and reading {{the latest issue of}} [1] Science News when Diane came down for breakfast. Pouring herself a cup of coffee Diane asked “What’s so {{interesting}} that I don’t even get a “good morning ”?” “It’s this Science News article about M&M’s. ” Jack replied, “These guys at Princeton, Cornell, and North Carolina showed how M&M’s packed randomly actually pack together as well as ordered spheres. ” “M&M’s! ” exclaimed Diane., “Sounds like a good candidate for a Golden Fleece award. I bet these guy’s were using taxpayer money to buy those M&M’s! Boy, that’s right up there with that tequila fish study!” “Hold on a minute Diane. It also says here that this study has implications for materials science and other important things. ” “I’ll bet. ” said Diane. “Well anyway ” muttered Jack, “I think it’s kind of neat. Actually, look at this, it says here that they not only used real M&M’s, but also did computer simulations of M&M packing. ” “Huh, I wonder how they did that. ” said Diane, “I remember reading that Shrek used a lot of computer graphics and a lot of math. I wonder if that’s related. ” “Could be. ” said Jack, “In my Calc class we’ve been drawing these neat pictures with this thing called Maple. I’ll bet I could use that to draw an M&M. ” “Yea, that’s neat. ” replied Diane, “But, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>they</b> had to do more than that. I mean, how did they get the size right? How would you make your picture the same as a real M&M?” “Good question. They give some other references here [2, 3], I bet I could use the information in these articles to make my picture accurate. ” “Maybe. ” said Diane, “But I think you’d still need to measure a real M&M. But, if you got it right, that would be cool! You could figure out the volume of an M&M and then use that info to figure out how many M&M’s this jar could hold. ” “Hey, then we could win one of those bean-guessing contests! ” said Jack. “There’s a question for you, I wonder if jelly-beans pack better?” “Or Reese’s Pieces. ” said Diane. “Aren’t they the same shape as M&M’s? ” asked Jack. “Oh yeah. ” replied Diane. “Here’s another crazy idea. In my Calc class we looked at the curve you get when you intersect a cylinder and a sphere. It looked like the stitches on a baseball. I wonder what you’d get if you intersected an M&M with a cylinder?...|$|E
