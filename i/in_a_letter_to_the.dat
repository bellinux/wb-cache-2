Wollstonecraft's was the first response in a pamphlet war sparked by the publication of Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), a defense of constitutional monarchy, aristocracy, and the Church of England.|$|E
5|$|A merchant, José Ignacio Rezábal, {{attended}} the open cabildo but, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> priest Julián S. de Agüero, {{said that he}} had some doubts which were shared by other people close to him. He feared that, no matter which party prevailed in the open cabildo, it would take revenge against the other, the Mutiny of Álzaga being a recent precedent. He felt that the open cabildo would lack legitimacy if too many criollos were allowed to take part in it {{as a result of the}} aforementioned manipulation of the guest list.|$|E
5|$|After two weeks, {{when the}} {{dealership}} had sold every print it had, Ortiz removed the display. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> editor of The New York Times, he accused Comstock of causing the controversy to earn greater publicity for himself, {{and stated that}} he wearied of crowds outside his shop, who blocked paying customers from entering it. Ultimately, Comstock did not pursue legal action. The historian Walter M. Kendrick attributes this apparent leniency to September Morn status {{as a work of}} art, whereas Gerald Carson, writing in American Heritage, attributes it to a knowledge that no action could be taken against the work.|$|E

5|$|Some contemporaries {{alleged that}} Bonaparte was put {{under house arrest}} at Nice for his {{association}} with the Robespierres following their fall in the Thermidorian Reaction in July 1794, but Napoleon's secretary Bourrienne disputed the allegation in his memoirs. According to Bourrienne, jealousy was responsible, between the Army of the Alps and the Army of Italy (with whom Napoleon was seconded at the time). Bonaparte dispatched an impassioned defense <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> commissar Saliceti, and he was subsequently acquitted of any wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|Two further Carry On films {{followed}} for Jacques in 1972: Carry On Matron, {{for which she}} was engaged in the title role, and Carry On Abroad, as Floella, the fiery Spanish cook at a half-finished hotel. As well as the film being Charles Hawtrey's last, it also marked a reduction in Jacques's screen time; she spent only one week filming her scenes. During post-production, the film's insurers became concerned about Jacques's deteriorating health. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> series producer Peter Rogers, they expressed their reluctance to insure her on set in any future film.|$|E
5|$|When the Second World War {{began in}} September 1939, Lang saw his main duty as the {{preservation}} of spiritual values during what he deemed to be an honourable conflict. He opposed strategies such as indiscriminate bombing, and on 21 December 1940, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Times signed jointly with Temple and Cardinal Hinsley, Lang expressed support for the pope's Five Peace Points initiative. Lang was sympathetic to the Sword of the Spirit campaign, founded by Cardinal Hinsley in 1940 to combat anti-democratic tendencies among Catholics. In May 1941 Lambeth Palace, Lang's London home, was hit by bombs and made uninhabitable.|$|E

5|$|Balzac {{had written}} more than seventy novels {{when he began}} La Cousine Bette, and {{populated}} them with recurring characters. Many {{of the characters in}} the novel, therefore, appear with extensive back-stories and biographical depth. For example, Célestin Crevel first appeared in Balzac's 1837 novel César Birotteau, working for the title character. Having accumulated a considerable fortune in that book, Crevel spends his time in La Cousine Bette enjoying the spoils of his labor. Another important recurring character is Marshal Hulot, who first appeared as a colonel in Les Chouans. In the years between that story and La Cousine Bette, he became the Count of Forzheim; <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Constitutionnel, Balzac described how Marshal Hulot gained this title. The presence of Crevel and Marshal Hulot– among others– in La Cousine Bette allows a continuation of each character's life story, adding emphasis or complexity to earlier events.|$|E
5|$|By 1922, {{the display}} of unity by white farmers against {{chartered}} rule at the 1920 elections fell apart. The majority of them, mostly ranchers and tobacco planters, who relied on the southern market, voted for Union. On the other hand, Mashonaland maize growers, wanting to retain full share of the local produce markets, wanted responsible government. The 1922 referendum results were 8,774 for responsible government and 5,989 for joining South Africa. The {{role of women in}} the defeat of the Unionists was substantial, with approximately 75% of them voting for responsible government, even when their husbands voted for Union. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts, the Company Administrator Sir Francis Drummond Chaplin cited anti-Afrikaner sentiments, particularly amongst women, as {{a major factor in the}} result.|$|E

5|$|Even though Champollion {{was appalled}} by the rampant looting of ancient {{artefacts}} and destruction of monuments, the expedition {{also contributed to the}} destruction. Most notably, while studying the Valley of the Kings, he damaged KV17, the tomb of Seti I, by removing a wall panel of 2.26 x 1.05m in a corridor. English explorers attempted to dissuade the destruction of the tomb, but Champollion persisted, stating that he had the permission of the Muhammad Ali Pasha. Champollion also carved his name into a pillar at Karnak. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pasha recommended that tourism, excavation and trafficking of artefacts be strictly controlled. Champollion's suggestions may have led to Muhammad Ali's 1835 ordinance prohibiting all exports of antiquities and ordering the construction of a museum in which to house the ancient artifacts.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{editor in}} Aftenposten on 17 June, {{submitted}} by Robert M. Steen, {{it was suggested}} that reaching the ledge would be a suitable challenge for the mountaineering association Norsk Tindeklub. The newspaper contacted the club, and offered to cover all expenses. The club sent Boye Schlytter and Henning Tønsberg to Bergen, where they joined forces with police officer Hermann Heggenes and photographer and firefighter Alf Adriansen. The expedition was led by Balchen, arriving with the BSD vessel Vulcanus. Arne Næss, Jr. had just used bolts to climb the Dolomites, and these had been lent to Tønsberg. As such, {{it was the first time}} bolts were used for climbing in Norway.|$|E
5|$|James had a {{controversial}} religious policy; {{his attempt to}} grant freedom of religion to non-Anglicans by suspending acts of Parliament by royal decree was not well received. Mary considered such action illegal, and her chaplain expressed this view <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Archbishop of Canterbury, William Sancroft, on her behalf. She was further dismayed when James refused to help when the Catholic King of France, Louis XIV, invaded Orange and persecuted Huguenot refugees there. In an attempt to damage William, James encouraged his daughter's staff to inform her that William {{was having an affair}} with Elizabeth Villiers. Acting on the information, Mary waited outside Villiers's room and caught her husband leaving it late at night. William denied adultery, and Mary apparently believed and forgave him. Possibly, Villiers and William were not meeting as lovers but to exchange diplomatic intelligence. Mary's staff was dismissed and sent back to Britain.|$|E
