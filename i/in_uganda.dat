5|$|Although {{he enjoyed}} the posting as drugs adviser, Penfold was keen {{to go back to}} Africa. He applied for a post as high {{commissioner}} in Namibia, but the post was downgraded and the application fell through. Penfold was then offered a posting to Sierra Leone. Although it was a lower-ranking post than the British Virgin Islands, Penfold was assured that taking the position would not adversely affect his career, so he accepted and, in March 1997, was appointed High Commissioner to Sierra Leone. He later stated that he believed his previous experience in Africa, particularly <b>in</b> <b>Uganda,</b> stood him in good stead for the events of his posting to Sierra Leone. The country {{was in the middle of}} a bloody civil war in 1997, and on 25 May—six weeks into Penfold's tenure—President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's government was overthrown in a military coup. Although the coup itself did not come as a surprise, the timing caught the international community off-guard. As <b>in</b> <b>Uganda</b> a decade earlier, Penfold gathered all the high commission staff and their families under one roof.|$|E

5|$|Female hippos reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{five to six}} years and have a gestation period of eight months. A study of endocrine systems revealed that female hippopotamuses may begin puberty as early as three or four years. Males reach maturity at around 7.5 yr. A study of hippopotamus reproductive behaviour <b>in</b> <b>Uganda</b> showed that peak conceptions occurred during {{the end of the}} wet season in the summer, and peak births occurred toward the beginning of the wet season in late winter. This is because of the female's oestrous cycle; as with most large mammals, male hippopotamus spermatozoa is active year-round. Studies of hippos in Zambia and South Africa also showed evidence of births occurring {{at the start of the}} wet season. After becoming pregnant, a female hippopotamus will typically not begin ovulation again for 17 months.|$|E
