5|$|A {{botanical garden}} is a {{controlled}} and staffed institution {{for the maintenance}} of a living collection of plants under scientific management for purposes of education and research, together with such libraries, herbaria, laboratories, and museums as are essential to its particular undertakings. Each botanical garden naturally develops its own special fields of interests depending on its personnel, location, extent, available funds, and the terms of its charter. It may include greenhouses, test grounds, an herbarium, an arboretum, and other departments. It maintains a scientific as well as a plant-growing staff, and publication <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> major modes of expression.|$|E

5|$|Seaborg {{remained}} at the University of California, Berkeley, for post-doctoral research. He followed Frederick Soddy's work investigating isotopes {{and contributed to the}} discovery of more than 100 isotopes of elements. Using one of Lawrence's advanced cyclotrons, John Livingood, Fred Fairbrother, and Seaborg created a new isotope of iron, iron-59 (Fe-59) in 1937. Iron-59 was useful in the studies of the hemoglobin in human blood. In 1938, Livingood and Seaborg collaborated (as they did for five years) to create an important isotope of iodine, iodine-131 (I-131), which is still used to treat thyroid disease. (Many years later, it was credited with prolonging the life of Seaborg's mother.) As a result of these and other contributions, Seaborg is regarded as a pioneer in nuclear medicine and <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> most prolific discoverers of isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Strombid {{gastropods}} {{were widely}} accepted as carnivores by several authors in the 19th century, {{a concept that}} persisted until {{the first half of}} the 20th century. This erroneous idea originated in the writings of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who classified strombids with other supposedly carnivorous snails. This idea was subsequently repeated by other authors, but were not supported by observation. Subsequent studies have refuted the concept, proving beyond doubt that strombid gastropods are herbivorous animals. In common with other Strombidae, Lobatus gigas is a specialized herbivore, that feeds on macroalgae (including red algae, such as species of Gracilaria and Hypnea), seagrass and unicellular algae, intermittently also feeding on algal detritus. The green macroalgae Batophora oerstedii <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> preferred foods.|$|E
