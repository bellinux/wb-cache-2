5|$|The main {{theme of}} Minority Report {{is the classic}} {{philosophical}} <b>debate</b> <b>of</b> free will versus determinism. Other themes explored by the film include involuntary commitment, the nature of political and legal systems in a high technology-advanced society, the rights of privacy in a media-dominated world, {{and the nature of}} self-perception.

5|$|When General Andrew Jackson {{tried and}} {{executed}} two British agents during the First Seminole War in Spanish-held Florida, it precipitated the Great Seminole <b>Debate</b> <b>of</b> 1818–1819 in Congress, with some claiming he exceeded his orders from President James Monroe and demanding his censure.

5|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to convince his fellow Hominidae to follow him, Pitar manages to persuade the patriarchal leader of the clan, Costello, who has taken command from the recently deceased Thorn. The band builds windbreaks to help them descend more often from the trees, thus exposing them to a higher risk of being attacked by predators on the ground. A rivalry emerges between Costello and another band member, Re, who not only questions the leading abilities of the present alpha but also desires Costello's females. To alleviate the escalating <b>debate</b> <b>of</b> authority, Pitar tries to implement a parliament to settle disputes peacefully. Costello, however, considers the parliament to be a forum in which he can consolidate his power, citing famous speeches by Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln; the other members ruin this noble idea with their lack of discipline and ostentatious indifference.|$|E

5|$|Although often {{assumed to}} be a <b>debate</b> <b>of</b> recent origins, local Washington, D.C. {{newspapers}} have published news items on the controversy many times since at least 1971, all in response to Native American individuals or organizations asking for the name to be changed. National protests began in 1988, after the team's Super Bowl XXII victory, prompting numerous Native Americans to write letters to Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke; others boycotted Redskins products and protested, but Cooke rejected the possibility of change. There was a protest of about 2,000 people at the 1992 Super Bowl between the Redskins and the Buffalo Bills; the American Indian Movement's (AIM) Vernon Bellecourt {{was one of the main}} organizers of the protest.|$|E
5|$|Following the Annexation of Texas to the United States, Sam Houston {{shuttled}} {{back and}} forth to Washington, D.C. as the state's U.S. senator for 13 years, while Margaret remained in Texas raising their children. When he was elected the state's governor, Margaret became First Lady of the state of Texas and was pregnant with their last child. Her brief tenure came on the cusp of the Civil War, {{at a time when the}} state was torn apart over the <b>debate</b> <b>of</b> whether or not to secede from the United States, while her husband worked in vain to defeat the Texas Ordinance of Secession. There had been an attempt on his life, and angry mobs gathered in the streets near the governor's mansion. With children to protect, and no government security forces in place, she lived in fear for her family's safety.|$|E
5|$|Howe's {{impatience with}} the {{necessity}} for parliamentary <b>debate</b> <b>of</b> his proposals won him few friends, and he was often accused of dictatorial conduct by the Opposition. As the Liberal government entered its third decade, it and Howe {{came to be seen}} as arrogant. The Government's attempt to impose closure in the 1956 Pipeline Debate led to major controversy in the House of Commons. In the 1957 election, Howe's actions and policies were made an issue by Opposition leader John Diefenbaker. Howe faced a serious challenge in his riding, but was expected to make speeches elsewhere as a major Liberal leader. Howe lost his seat in the election, and Diefenbaker became Prime Minister, ending almost 22years of Liberal rule. Howe returned to the private sector, accepting a number of corporate directorships. The former minister died suddenly {{of a heart attack in}} December 1960.|$|E

5|$|In 1743 the Cameronians {{established}} {{themselves as}} the Reformed Presbyterian Church, remaining largely separate from religious and political <b>debate.</b> <b>Of</b> independent churches from England that were established {{in the seventeenth century}} only the Quakers managed to endure in to the eighteenth century. Baptist chapels were re-established {{in the middle of the}} century and, although Scotland initially appeared fertile ground for Methodism, it failed to expand as quickly as elsewhere in the Great Britain and Ireland. A number of minor Scottish sects developed, such as the Bereans, Buchanites, Daleites and Glassites.|$|E
5|$|In 1768 Johnson {{went into}} {{partnership}} with John Payne (Johnson {{was probably the}} senior partner); the following year they published 50 titles. Under Johnson and Payne, the firm published a wider array of works than under Johnson and Davenport. Although Johnson looked to his business interests, he did not publish works only to enrich himself. Projects that encouraged free discussion appealed to Johnson; for example, he helped Priestley publish the Theological Repository, a financial failure that nevertheless fostered open <b>debate</b> <b>of</b> theological questions. Although the journal lost Johnson money in the 1770s, {{he was willing to}} begin publishing it again in 1785 because he endorsed its values.|$|E
5|$|The King and {{parliament}} {{met again}} in February 1310, {{and the proposed}} discussions of Scottish policy were replaced by <b>debate</b> <b>of</b> domestic problems. Edward was petitioned to abandon Gaveston as his counsellor and instead adopt the advice of 21 elected barons, termed Ordainers, who would carry out a widespread reform of both {{the government and the}} royal household. Under huge pressure, Edward agreed to the proposal and the Ordainers were elected, broadly evenly split between reformers and conservatives. While the Ordainers began their plans for reform, Edward and Gaveston took a new army of around 4,700 men to Scotland, where the military situation had continued to deteriorate. Robert the Bruce declined to give battle and the campaign progressed ineffectually over the winter until supplies and money ran out in 1311, forcing Edward to return south.|$|E

5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt was captured on video by several cameras, including those {{belonging to the}} Big Three television networks; ABC began airing footage at 2:42p.m. All three networks erroneously reported that Brady had died. While the Cable News Network (CNN) {{did not have a}} camera of its own at the shooting it was able to use NBC's pool feed, and by staying on the story for 48 hours, the network, less than a year old, built a reputation for thoroughness. Shocked Americans gathered around television sets in homes and shopping centers. Some cited the alleged Curse of Tippecanoe, and others recalled the assassinations of Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. Newspapers printed extra editions and used gigantic headlines; the United States Senate adjourned, interrupting <b>debate</b> <b>of</b> Reagan's economic proposals; and churches held prayer services.|$|E
5|$|The first {{broadcast}} <b>debate</b> <b>of</b> {{the campaign}} {{took place on}} 28 September 2011, the day that nominations closed, on RTÉ Radio 1's News at One programme.

A second debate was held on The Late Late Show on 30 September; David Norris was not interviewed alone as the other six candidates were as he had been interviewed the previous week on the programme, but was included in the later panel debate.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{debate for}} an {{official}} Canadian flag intensified {{and became a}} subject of controversy, culminating in the Great Flag <b>Debate</b> <b>of</b> 1964. In 1963, the minority Liberal government of Lester B. Pearson gained power and decided to adopt an official Canadian flag through parliamentary debate. The principal political proponent of the change was Pearson. He had been a significant broker during the Suez Crisis of 1956, {{for which he was}} awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. During the crisis, Pearson was disturbed when the Egyptian government objected to Canadian peacekeeping forces {{on the grounds that the}} Canadian flag (the Red Ensign) contained the same symbol (the Union Flag) also used as a flag by the United Kingdom, one of the belligerents. Pearson's goal was for the Canadian flag to be distinctive and unmistakably Canadian. The main opponent to changing the flag was the leader of the opposition and former prime minister, John Diefenbaker, who eventually made the subject a personal crusade.|$|E

5|$|Finney {{disagreed}} with the accidental voyaging portion of Sharp's hypothesis. To investigate the problem, he founded the Polynesian Voyaging Society with Herb Kane and Tommy Holmes in 1973, intent on building a voyaging canoe to sail from Hawaii to Tahiti to test whether intentional two-way voyaging throughout Oceania could be replicated. With the help of Mau's navigational knowledge guiding Hōkūle‘a, the Polynesian Voyaging Society demonstrated that intentional voyaging was not only possible, but also the ancestors of the Polynesians could have settled the Pacific on similar voyages using non-instrument wayfinding techniques such as Mau's. Finally, linguistic and archaeological {{evidence suggests that the}} history of the Polynesian people does not originate in the East Pacific but in the West. Recent developments in the field of DNA analysis have unequivocally settled the <b>debate</b> <b>of</b> Polynesian origin. They prove Polynesians share common ancestry with indigenous Taiwanese and East Asians.|$|E
5|$|Privy Counsellors {{have the}} right to sit {{on the steps of the}} Sovereign's Throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords during debates, a {{privilege}} which was shared with heirs apparent of those hereditary peers who were to become members of the House of Lords before Labour's partial Reform of the Lords in 1999, diocesan bishops of the Church of England yet to be Lords Spiritual, retired bishops who formerly sat in the House of Lords, the Dean of Westminster, Peers of Ireland, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. While Privy Counsellors {{have the right}} to sit on the steps of the Sovereign's Throne they do so only as observers and are not allowed to participate in any of the workings of the House of Lords. Nowadays this privilege is rarely exercised. A notable recent instance of the exercising of this privilege was used by the Prime Minister, Theresa May, who watched the opening of the <b>debate</b> <b>of</b> the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2017 in the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|Riel {{made his}} way to Montreal and, fearing arrest or assassination, vacillated as to whether he should attempt to take up his seat in the House of Commons—Edward Blake, the Premier of Ontario, had {{announced}} a bounty of $5,000 for his arrest. Famously, Riel was the only Member of Parliament who was not present for the great Pacific Scandal <b>debate</b> <b>of</b> 1873 that led to the resignation of the Macdonald government in November. Liberal leader Alexander Mackenzie became the interim prime minister, and a general election was held in January 1874. Although the Liberals under Mackenzie formed the new government, Riel easily retained his seat. Formally, Riel had to sign a register book at least once upon being elected, and he did so under disguise in late January. He was nevertheless stricken from the rolls following a motion supported by Schultz, who had become the member for the electoral district of Lisgar.|$|E
