5|$|In 1991, Sid Meier {{released}} Civilization and popularized {{the level}} of detail {{that has become a}} staple of the genre. Sid Meier's Civilization was influenced by board games such as Risk and the Avalon Hill board game also called Civilization. A notable similarity between the Civilization computer game and board game <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of diplomacy and technological advancement. Sid Meier's Civilization was also influenced by personal computer games such as the city management game SimCity and the wargame Empire. Civilization became widely successful and influenced many 4X games to come.|$|E

25|$|According to {{cognitive}} linguist George Lakoff, liberal philosophy {{is based on}} five basic categories of morality. The first, the promotion of fairness, is generally described as an emphasis on empathy as a desirable trait. With this social contract based on the Golden Rule comes the rationale for many liberal positions. The second category is assistance to those who cannot assist themselves. A nurturing, philanthropic spirit {{is one that is}} considered good in liberal philosophy. This leads to the third category, the desire to protect those who cannot defend themselves. The fourth category <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of fulfilling one's life; allowing a person to experience all that they can. The fifth and final category <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of caring for oneself, since only thus can one act to help others.|$|E

25|$|Pharaoh {{is set in}} the Egypt of 108785 BCE as {{that country}} {{experiences}} internal stresses and external threats that will culminate in the fall of its Twentieth Dynasty and New Kingdom. The young protagonist Ramses learns that those who would challenge the powers that be are vulnerable to co-option, seduction, subornation, defamation, intimidation and assassination. Perhaps the chief lesson, belatedly absorbed by Ramses as pharaoh, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance,</b> to power, of knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Another {{consideration}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> {{of leadership}} {{being able to}} communicate with the invasion force. In ancient times, this often meant that a king needed to lead his armies in person to be certain his commands were timely and followed, {{as in the case of}} Alexander the Great (356-323 BCE). At that time, the skills needed to lead troops in battle were as important as the skills needed to run a country during peacetime. When it was necessary for the king to be elsewhere, messengers would relay updates back to the rear, often on horseback or, in cases such as the Battle of Marathon (490 BCE), with swift runners.|$|E
25|$|The book {{refers to}} the book of learning, however, for a {{university}} that sought to implement the Oxbridge traditions of teaching excellence, {{it is important to}} note that the La Trobe book, unlike Oxford, Cambridge, Sydney or Monash, does not contain clasps, which signifies that the book cannot be opened with ease. Its absence does not suggest that the La Trobian approach to learning is any less rigorous, rather, it represents a different approach towards knowledge that can only be seen in conjunction with the other heraldic symbols. That is, that learning and the pursuit of enlightenment is attained through the journey that one undertakes to achieve their desired outcome. Even then, the outcome at which one has reached, may not have been the outcome initially sought. Thus, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> placed on the journey of learning, and what is derived from it, that forms the heart of the university philosophy.|$|E

500|$|There is no {{doctrine}} {{laid out}} in 3 John, which is strictly a personal letter, but the overall theme <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of hospitality, {{especially when it comes}} to men who were working to spread the gospel. [...] Third John is the shortest book of the Bible by word count, though 2 John has fewer verses. It is the only New Testament book which does not contain the names [...] "Jesus" [...] or [...] "Christ".|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of the modern, organic society <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance,</b> sacredness even, given to the concept – social fact – of the individual. The individual, rather than the collective, becomes the focus of rights and responsibilities, the center {{of public and private}} rituals holding the society together – a function once performed by the religion. To stress the importance of this concept, Durkheim talked of the [...] "cult of the individual": ...|$|E
500|$|A 2003 {{interview}} in Newsweek quotes Stephenson's belief that [...] "science fiction... is fiction in which ideas {{play an important}} part." [...] Central to Quicksilver [...] <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of the Enlightenment. By placing the reader among a world of ideas that {{change the course of}} science, Stephenson explores the development of the scientific method. One theme Stephenson explores in Quicksilver is the advancement of mathematical sciences which in turn led to important applications: Leibniz's theory of binary mathematics became the foundation upon which to develop computers. [...] As he did in Cryptonomicon, Stephenson highlights the importance of networks and codes, which in Quicksilver [...] occur against a [...] "backdrop of staggering diversity and detail", writes Mark Sanderson in his review of the book for the Daily Telegraph. Also, returning to his cyberpunk roots, Stephenson emphasizes the manner in which information and ideas are dispersed in complex societies. Quicksilver uses the [...] "interactions of philosophy, court intrigue, economics, wars, plagues and natural disasters" [...] of the late 17th and early 18th century to create a historical backdrop. From one perspective, the characters are most useful in their roles as [...] "carriers of information". Although the characters use various techniques to disseminate information, the most prominent is cryptography. Elizabeth Weisse writes in USA Today that the use of cryptography is [...] "Stephenson's literary calling card", as she compares Quicksilver to [...] Cryptonomicon.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{argument}} {{these scholars}} bring up <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> that Muhammad {{attached to the}} Quran.

2500|$|But Pharaoh is par {{excellence}} a political novel. Its young protagonist, Prince Ramses (who is 22 {{years old at}} the novel's opening), learns that those who would oppose the priesthood are vulnerable to cooptation, seduction, subornation, defamation, intimidation or assassination. Perhaps the chief lesson, belatedly absorbed by Ramses as pharaoh, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance,</b> to power, of knowledge — of [...] science.|$|E
2500|$|Another [...] of {{the story}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of {{situational}} awareness. Christian media consultant Phil Cooke tells the story, conceding that it's fictional, and uses it to demonstrate {{the importance of the}} research he reads, and knowing one's audience in particular. [...] "We're blind unless we know who we're talking to." [...] "hile it is s ship, it's most definitely not his ocean" [...] writes Russ Linden, a columnist at Governing, of the lesson offered.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{aspect of}} the {{language}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of using poetry in conversations. Modifying or rephrasing a classic poem according to the current situation was expected behavior in Heian court life, and often served to communicate thinly veiled allusions. The poems in the Genji are often in the classic Japanese tanka form. Many of the poems were well known to the intended audience, so usually only the first few lines are given and the reader is supposed to complete the thought themselves, much like today we could say [...] "when in Rome..." [...] and leave {{the rest of the}} saying ("...do as the Romans do") unspoken.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{difficult}} to categorise Hume's political affiliations. His writings contain elements that are, in modern terms, both conservative and liberal, although these terms are anachronistic. Thomas Jefferson banned the History from University of Virginia, feeling that it had [...] "spread universal toryism over the land". By comparison, Samuel Johnson thought Hume [...] "a Tory by chance... for he has no principle. If he is anything, he is a Hobbist", a follower of Thomas Hobbes. A major concern of Hume's political philosophy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> {{of the rule of}} law. He also stresses throughout his political essays the importance of moderation in politics: public spirit and regard to the community.|$|E

This market is more standardised than the others with convertible structures being relatively uniform (e.g. Standard Make-Whole take over features, Contingent Conversion @ 130%). Regarding the trading, the American convertible market is [...] "centralised" [...] around TRACE which helps in terms of price transparency. One other particularity of this market <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of the Mandatory Convertibles and Preferred especially for Financials (about 10-20% of the issuances in the US regional benchmarks).
