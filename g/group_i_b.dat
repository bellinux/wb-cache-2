The proteins could be subdivided into two groups: <b>group</b> <b>I</b> (<b>B.</b> megaterium A and C proteins, B. cereus A protein, and B. subtilis alpha and beta proteins) and group II (B. cereus and B. megaterium B proteins and B. subtilis gamma protein).

Mg decreases with depth from 50 mM at the seafloor to 21 mM at 900 mbsf. Mn in the sulfate reduction zone (1. 0 to 2. 8 ppm) is more highly concentrated than in the methane fermentation zone (0. 23 to 0. 50 ppm), except for Section 116 - 718 - 1 H- 1. A similar behavior is also observed for V and Pb. Ni, B, and K decrease non-uniformly with depth. Ca and Sr increase with depth at the same rates, indicating the dissolution of inorganic calcium carbonate by anaerobic oxidation of organic matter (Sayles, 1981, doi: 10. 1016 / 0016 - 7037 (81) 90132 - 0). The distribution of Ba with depth {{is very similar to}} those of Ca and Sr. Cu and Ti profiles trend to increase non-uniformly with depth. Fe is constant with depth. The sharp decrease in total silicate concentration at the seafloor probably indicates a decrease in the decomposition of siliceous biological matter (e. g., diatoms) and production of opal.

This indicates that Pd preferentially stays at the first layer of the LFO surface than the bulk position to some extent. One VO in the surface appears at the subsurface (LaO layer) when ΔμO is lower than - 1.17 eV. The surface containing Pd 2 VO is predicted to be stable between points A and B, indicating conditions with standard pressure at temperatures between 1, 000 and 1, 500 K. Two Pd atoms attract each other in such a surface by sharing one VO in the first LaO layer (Figure  2 group II (b)). The Pd 1 VO 1 -containing surface (Figure  2 group II (n)) becomes dominant at ΔμO below - 1.67 eV (point B) under standard pressure at temperatures over 1, 500 K.

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} the role of interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) gene polymorphism and its serum level in predicting response to treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus. Patients and methodsThis study was carried out on 35 Egyptian patients with chronic HCV (Hepatitis C Virus) and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects as control. They were divided as follows: Group I: 35 chronic HCV patients. They were subdivided according to their response to combination therapy of pegylated interferon alpha 2 b and ribavirin into: Group I (a) : 21 responder patients. <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> (<b>b)</b> : 14 non responder patients. Group II: 15 healthy subjects as a control group. IL- 10 serum level was assessed by ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) before, during and after treatment. IL- 10 gene polymorphism and genotype were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). ResultsA significant higher level of serum IL- 10 was detected in HCV patients compared to the control group. A significant reduction was detected during treatment and a persistent decrease was found in patients with SVR. Low serum level of IL- 10 pretreatment was associated with high treatment response. High pretreatment of the serum level of IL- 10 was associated with the severity of chronic necroinflammation and non response to treatment. A positive correlation was found between IL- 10 and serum ALT. The frequency of IL- 10 592 genotype polymorphism was higher in HCV patients compared to control. A significant higher frequency of the IL- 10 592 C/C polymorphism was found in the responder group compared to non responder. No correlation was observed between IL- 10 polymorphism and liver histopathology. ConclusionSerum IL- 10 level pretreatment is useful for predicting treatment response in HCV patients. IL- 10 may be a useful marker to assess necroinflammation and to monitor the evolution of liver damage. IL- 10 gene polymorphism has no relation to liver histopathology. IL- 10 592 C/C genotype was more frequent in responder patients...|$|E
40|$|Genetic typing {{of small}} round {{structured}} viruses (SRSVs) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing has {{been confined to}} analysis of the RNA polymerase because of the considerable genome variability outside of this region. To provide capsid sequence data for epidemiological studies and outbreak investigations, a broadly reactive capsid PCR was developed using two sets of degenerate, inosine-containing primers. Primer pairs Capla/Caplb and Caplla/Capllb specifically amplify a 223 -bp region of the SRSV capsid open reading frame from SRSV genetic groups I and II, respectively. The capsid PCR was used to investigate SRSVs from nine UK outbreaks of gastroenteritis occurring between 1992 and 1995. Differential amplification by the primer pairs suggested that three strains belonged to genetic group I and six to genetic group II. The capsid amino acid sequences of the group I strains were 75. 9 % to 79. 3 % identical with Sot/ 91 /UK (group I), while those of the group II strains were 75. 9 % to 98. 3 % identical with Bri/ 93 /UK (group II). Phylogenetic comparison of the capsid region from the outbreak strains and 13 previously characterised SRSVs revealed clusters of strains closely related to Bri/ 93 /UK and Tor/ 77 /C within genetic group II. With the exception of some Bri/ 93 /UK-like strains, there was no correlation between capsid sequence and the geographical origin of SRSVs. UK strains were found with greater than 90 % capsid sequence identity to SRSVs from various locations worldwide including Australia (Cam/ 94 /A), Canada (Tor/ 77 /C), Hawaii (Haw/ 71 /US), and Saudi Arabia (DSV 395 / 90 /SA) together with <b>group</b> <b>I</b> (<b>B</b> 447 / 92 /UK) and group II (Yat/ 94 /UK) strains that were genetically distinct from known SRSV capsids.

In {{an attempt to}} phylogenetically analyze these pathogen-related oral spirochetes, we used immunomagnetic separation, combined with comparative sequence analysis of 16 S rRNA genes amplified in vitro by the PCR. The bacteria were immunomagnetically enriched from subgingival plaque samples of patients with rapidly progressive periodontitis by using MAb H 9 - 2 specific for the 37 -kDa endoflagellum sheath protein of T. pallidum. After PCR amplification with universal eubacterial primers 16 S rRNA gene fragments were cloned into Escherichia coli. A total of 20 randomly selected recombinants were analyzed by sequencing about 200 to 300 bases of the 500 -bp inserts. All the spirochetal 16 S rRNA sequences clustered to previously described, as yet uncultivable cluster 7 treponemes of <b>group</b> <b>I</b> (<b>B.</b> K. Choi, B. J. Paster, F. E. Dewhirst, and U.

With a sequence similarity of 96. 4 % the most closely related cultivable treponeme was Treponema vincentii, which also belongs to the group I treponemes. Subsequent immunological analysis of cultured treponemes with MAb H 9 - 2 revealed that only T. vincentii strains showed specific immunofluorescence or a characteristic 37 -kDa band in immunoblots. We therefore conclude that pathogen-related oral spirochetes constitute a heterogeneous population of treponemes comprising T. vincentii and T. vincentii-related organisms that have common epitopes cross-reacting with MAb H 9 - 2...|$|E

In three groups of four GnRH-deficient men, the frequency of GnRH stimulation was decreased at weekly intervals from (a) every 2 - 3 - 4 h (<b>group</b> <b>I),</b> (<b>b)</b> every 2 - 8 h without testosterone replacement (group II), or (c) every 2 - 8 h with testosterone replacement (group III). In three groups of three columns of perifused dispersed pituitary cells, pulses of GnRH were administered every 2, 4, or 8 h. In groups I and II, mean area under the luteinizing hormone (LH) curve increased (P less than 0. 025) and serum testosterone levels fell (P less than 0. 035) as the frequency of GnRH stimulation was decreased. In group III, the area under the LH curve also increased (P less than 0. 01) although serum testosterone levels were constant, thereby demonstrating that the increase in pituitary responsiveness to slow frequencies of GnRH stimulation occurs independently of changes in the sex steroid hormonal milieu. The area under the LH curve also increased in the perifused dispersed rat pituitary cells when the frequency of GnRH administration was decreased to every 8 h (P less than 0. 05), thus demonstrating that the enhanced pituitary responsiveness to slow frequencies of GnRH stimulation is maintained even in the complete absence of gonadal steroids. Nadir LH levels fell in all three groups (P less than 0. 01) as the frequency of GnRH stimulation was decreased. In contrast, mean peak LH levels, the rate of LH rise, and the rate of endogenous LH decay were constant as the frequency of GnRH stimulation was decreased. Finally, as the GnRH interpulse interval increased, mean LH levels fell, and mean follicle-stimulating hormone levels were stable or fell. These results indicate that (a) pituitary responsiveness to GnRH increases at slower frequencies of GnRH stimulation in models both in vivo and in vitro, (b) these changes in pituitary responsiveness occur independently of changes in gonadal steroid secretion, and (c) the increases in LH pulse amplitude and area under the curve at slow frequencies of GnRH stimulation are due to decreases in nadir, but not peak, LH levels. Slowing of the frequency of GnRH secretion may be an important independent variable in the control of pituitary gonadotropin secretion...|$|E
