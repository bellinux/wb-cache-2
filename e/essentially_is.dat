The baileys, which were separated by rock-cut ditches, housed the castle's stables, workshops, and storage facilities. It is common for extant castles {{to be the result}} of several phases of construction, and were adapted and added to over the period of their use; however Château Gaillard <b>essentially</b> <b>is</b> the result of one period of building. The division into three wards bears similarities with the design of Château de Chinon, built by HenryII in the mid-12thcentury on a promontory overlooking a town.|$|E

25|$|Cubist {{sculpture}} {{developed in}} parallel with Cubist painting, beginning in Paris around 1909 with its proto-Cubist phase, and evolving through the early 1920s. Just as Cubist painting, Cubist sculpture is rooted in Paul Cézanne's reduction of painted objects into component planes and geometric solids; cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones. Presenting fragments and facets of objects that could be visually interpreted in different ways {{had the effect of}} 'revealing the structure' of the object. Cubist sculpture <b>essentially</b> <b>is</b> the dynamic rendering of three-dimensional objects in the language of non-Euclidean geometry by shifting viewpoints of volume or mass in terms of spherical, flat and hyperbolic surfaces.|$|E

The book includes entire chapters devoted to key figures such as Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, Sam Simon and Conan O'Brien. The book's foreword was written by Canadian author Douglas Coupland.

500|$|What Aflaq saw in Islam was {{a revolutionary}} movement. In {{contrast}} to other nationalities, the Arab awakening and expansion {{was attributed to}} a religious message. Because of this, Aflaq believed that the Arab's spirituality was directly linked to Islam, therefore, one could never take Islam {{out of the equation}} of what is essentially, and <b>essentially</b> <b>is</b> not, Arab. Arab nationalism, just as Islam had been during the lifetime of Muhammad, was a spiritual revolutionary movement, [...] leading the Arabs towards a new renaissance: Arab nationalism was the second revolution to appear in the Arab world. All Arab religious communities should, according to Aflaq, respect and worship the spirituality of Islam, even if they did not worship Islam in a religious sense – Aflaq was a Christian who worshipped Islam. Aflaq did not believe it was necessary to worship Muhammad, but believed that all Arabs should strive to emulate Muhammad. In the words of Aflaq himself, Arabs [...] "belong to the nation that gave birth to a Muhammad; or rather, because this Arab individual {{is a member of the}} community which Muhammad put all his efforts into creating [...] Muhammad was all the Arabs; let us today make all the Arabs Muhammad." [...] The Muslim of Muhammad's days were, according to Aflaq, synonymous with Arabs – the Arabs were the only ones to preach the message of Islam during Muhammad's lifetime. In contrast to Jesus, who was a religious leader, but not a political leader, Muhammad was both – the first leader of Islam and of the Arab world. Therefore, secularisation could not take the same shape in the Arab world as it did in the West.|$|E

The wash is pumped into a column still where it is heated to over 200°F, causing the alcohol to turn to a vapor. As the vapor cools and falls it turns to a liquid called [...] "low wine", which measures 125 proof or 62.5% alcohol.

2500|$|According to many {{commentators}} {{the success}} of the [...] "Great Shakubuku Campaign" [...] launched by Toda at his 1951 inauguration was the result of zealous and over-aggressive techniques. [...] Toda adopted an aggressive and controversial method of proselytizing, based on Nichiren teachings on shakubuku (折伏), often translated character for character as [...] "break and subdue", sometimes as [...] "forced conversion," [...] or as [...] "to criticize and to convince". Shakubuku, <b>essentially,</b> <b>is</b> the more assertive of two different methods of proselytizing traditionally employed by Nichiren adherents, in which the proselytizer aggressively confronts a non-adherent about the falsity of their beliefs. According to some, Toda's brand of shakubuku was of an unusually aggressive nature and would come to give Soka Gakkai a reputation of militancy. It also resulted in widespread criticism in the popular press and also by other Buddhist sects. An alternative belief is that some overenthusiastic members were responsible for excessive activities despite the cautions of Toda.|$|E
2500|$|Roanoke has a weak mayor-{{city manager}} form of government.

The mayor has little, if any, executive authority and <b>essentially</b> <b>is</b> the [...] "first among equals" [...] on the city council.

Cowell. The city council has six members, not counting the mayor, all of whom are elected on an at-large basis. A proposal for a ward-based council, in which the mayor and vice mayor would continue to be elected at-large, was rejected by Roanoke voters in 1997, but ward system advocates still contend that the at-large system results in a disproportionate number of council members coming from affluent neighborhoods and that electing some or all council members on a ward basis would result in a more equal representation of all areas of the city. The four year terms of city council members are staggered, so there are biannual elections. The candidate who receives the most votes is designated the vice mayor for the following two years.|$|E

2500|$|As Mu Soeng indicates, {{one of the}} key tenets to {{practice}} is what Seungsahn often called [...] "together action." [...] Many members actually live in the zen centers, and one of the rules is that personal biases must be set aside {{for the good of the}} community. Also, chanting and prostrations, in addition to zazen, are very important forms of meditation for the school—aimed at clearing the mind of students. The school website says, [...] "Prostrations could be likened to the 'emergency measure' for clearing the mind. They are a very powerful technique for seeing the karma of a situation because both the mind and the body are involved. Something that might take days of sitting to digest may be digested in a much shorter time with prostrations. The usual practice here is to do 1000 bows a day (actually 1080). This can be done all at once or as is usually the case, spread out through the day." [...] The number of prostrations students often perform varies in part on their physical ability, though at least 108 and up to 1080 per day is usual. [...] Also unique in the KUSZ is the fact that celibacy is not required of those who are ordained. Rather, Seungsahn created the idea of a [...] "Bodhisattva Monk," [...] which <b>essentially</b> <b>is</b> an individual who can be married and hold a job but also be a monk in the order. [...] This status has now been superseded in the KUSZ by [...] "Bodhisattva Teacher", who takes the 48 precepts but is not considered an ordained monk.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the early-to-mid-17th century [...] "continental rationalism" [...] John Locke (1632–1704) proposed in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689) a very influential view wherein the only knowledge humans can have is a posteriori, i.e., based upon experience. Locke is famously attributed with holding {{the proposition that the}} human mind is a tabula rasa, a [...] "blank tablet", in Locke's words [...] "white paper", on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would not be what it is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the arrangement of its atomic structure. If an apple was structured differently, it would cease to be an apple. Secondary qualities are the sensory information we can perceive from its primary qualities. For example, an apple can be perceived in various colours, sizes, and textures but it is still identified as an apple. Therefore, its primary qualities dictate what the object <b>essentially</b> <b>is,</b> while its secondary qualities define its attributes. Complex ideas combine simple ones, and divide into substances, modes, and relations. According to Locke, our knowledge of things is a perception of ideas that are in accordance or discordance with each other, which {{is very different from the}} quest for certainty of Descartes.|$|E
