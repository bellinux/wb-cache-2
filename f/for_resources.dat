5|$|According to a {{mitochondrial}} DNA analysis, {{the black}} wildebeest {{seem to have}} diverged from the main lineage during the Middle Pleistocene and became a distinct species around a million years ago. A divergence rate of approximately 2% has been calculated. The split {{does not seem to}} have been driven by competition <b>for</b> <b>resources</b> but instead by the fact that each species adopted a different ecological niche and occupied a different trophic level.|$|E
5|$|Although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, {{gold and}} other {{minerals}} have been found, {{they have not}} been in large enough quantities to exploit. The 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty also restricts a struggle <b>for</b> <b>resources.</b> In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000–01 reported landing 112,934tonnes.|$|E

5|$|By {{agreement}} among the Allied nations, in March 1942 the Pacific theatre was divided into two separate commands, {{each with its own}} commander-in-chief. The South West Pacific Area, which included Australia, Indonesia, and the Philippines came under General Douglas MacArthur as supreme commander. Most of the remainder, known as the Pacific Ocean Areas, came under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. There was no overall commander, and no authority capable of resolving competing claims <b>for</b> <b>resources,</b> setting priorities, or shifting resources from one command to the other.

5|$|Free-roaming horses could once {{be found}} {{throughout}} much of the American frontier west of the Mississippi River, and may have numbered as many as two million around 1850. However, no comprehensive estimate of free-roaming horse numbers was done until 1971, and thus early estimates are speculative. Horse numbers were in decline as domestic cattle and sheep competed with them <b>for</b> <b>resources.</b> Ranchers shot horses to leave more grazing land for other livestock, other horses were captured off the range for human use, and some were rounded up for slaughter.|$|E

5|$|Native Americans {{also used}} {{the area around the}} Cascades for their agriculture, leading them to often congregate in the region. As a result, gold miners {{eventually}} reached the area in the 1870s-1890s, searching <b>for</b> <b>resources</b> and rich land.

5|$|Occasionally, {{groups may}} split {{up when they}} become so large that {{competition}} <b>for</b> <b>resources</b> is problematic, but even then, members of matrilines tend to stick together. Dominant females procure more food, matings, and supporters. Among olive baboons in Tanzania, high-ranking females give birth at shorter intervals to infants with a higher survival rate, and their daughters tend to mature faster than low-ranking females. However, these high-ranking females also {{appear to have a}} higher probability of miscarriages and some high-ranking matrilines have inexplicably low fertility. One theory suggests this occurs due to stress on the high-ranking females, although this theory is controversial.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{depend on}} certain edaphic (soil) and climatic factors in their {{environment}} but can modify these factors too. For example, they can change their environment's albedo, increase runoff interception, stabilise mineral soils and develop their organic content, and affect local temperature. Plants compete with other organisms in their ecosystem <b>for</b> <b>resources.</b> They interact with their neighbours {{at a variety of}} spatial scales in groups, populations and communities that collectively constitute vegetation. Regions with characteristic vegetation types and dominant plants as well as similar abiotic and biotic factors, climate, and geography make up biomes like tundra or tropical rainforest.|$|E

5|$|River otters often {{reside in}} beaver ponds. Encounters between otters and beavers are not {{necessarily}} hostile. In Idaho, otters and beavers were recorded in the same beaver lodge simultaneously on three separate occasions. The otters may compete with the American mink (Mustela vison) <b>for</b> <b>resources.</b> In Alaska, the two species living in marine environments indicate niche separation through resource partitioning, probably related to the swimming abilities of these mustelids.|$|E
5|$|The California Gold Rush in {{the mid-19th}} century {{dramatically}} increased travel by European-Americans in the area, causing competition <b>for</b> <b>resources</b> between the regional Paiute and Miwok and the miners and hangers on. In 1851 {{as part of the}} Mariposa Wars intended to suppress Native American resistance, United States Army Major Jim Savage led the Mariposa Battalion into the west end of Yosemite Valley. He was pursuing forces of around 200 Ahwahneechee led by Chief Tenaya.|$|E
5|$|The great {{rivalry between}} these two cities may {{have been based on}} more than {{competition}} <b>for</b> <b>resources.</b> Their dynastic histories reveal different origins and the intense competition between the two powers may have had an ideological grounding. Calakmul's dynasty seems ultimately derived from the great Preclassic city of El Mirador while the dynasty of Tikal was profoundly affected by the intervention of the distant central Mexican metropolis of Teotihuacan. With few exceptions, Tikal's monuments and those of its allies place great emphasis upon single male rulers while the monuments of Calakmul and its allies gave greater prominence to the female line and often the joint rule of king and queen.|$|E

The Town Center can fire arrows at enemy units within range if villagers or archers are garrisoned while under attack. Other economic buildings available include storage buildings <b>for</b> <b>resources,</b> farms, docks (the dock may also produce several military ships), and houses to support a higher population.|$|E
5|$|While some {{birds are}} {{essentially}} territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large flocks. The principal benefits of flocking are safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency. Defence against predators {{is particularly important}} in closed habitats like forests, where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system. This {{has led to the}} development of many mixed-species feeding flocks, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition <b>for</b> <b>resources.</b> Costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases.|$|E
5|$|Yagan {{would have}} been about 35 years old in 1829 when British {{settlers}} landed {{in the area and}} established the Swan River Colony. For {{the first two years of}} the colony, relations between settlers and Noongar were generally amicable, as there was little competition <b>for</b> <b>resources.</b> The Noongar welcomed the white settlers as Djanga, the returned spirits of their dead. Historical reports noted the two groups shared fish. As time passed, conflicts between the two cultures gradually became more frequent. The settlers incorrectly thought that the Noongar were nomads who had no claim to the land over which they roamed. Colonists fenced off land for grazing and farming according to their traditional practices of land use.|$|E

5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the kakapo's {{breeding}} system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition <b>for</b> <b>resources</b> (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely {{be able to produce}} eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.|$|E
5|$|British {{encroachment}} {{into areas}} of South Africa already settled by the Afrikaner Boers {{and the competition}} <b>for</b> <b>resources</b> and land that developed between them as a result, led to the Second Boer War in 1899. Pre-empting the deployment of British forces, the Afrikaner Republics of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal Republic under President Paul Kruger declared war on 11 October 1899, striking deep into the British territories of Natal and the Cape Colony. After the outbreak of war, plans for the dispatch of a combined Australian force were subsequently set aside by the British War Office {{and each of the}} six colonial governments sent separate contingents to serve with British formations, with two squadrons each of 125 men from New South Wales and Victoria, and one each from the other colonies. The first troops arrived three weeks later, with the New South Wales Lancers—who had been training in England before the war, hurriedly diverted to South Africa. On 22 November, the Lancers came under fire for the first time near Belmont, and they subsequently forced their attackers to withdraw after inflicting significant casualties on them.|$|E
5|$|C.maenas is a predator, {{feeding on}} many organisms, {{particularly}} bivalve molluscs (such as clams, oysters, and mussels), polychaetes and small crustaceans. They are primarily nocturnal, although activity {{also depends on}} the tide, and crabs can be active {{at any time of}} day. In California, preferential predation of C.maenas on native clams (Nutricola spp.) resulted in the decline of the native clams and an increase of a previously introduced clam (the amethyst gem clam, Gemma gemma). C.maenas has been implicated in the destruction of the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) fisheries on the east coast of the United States and Canada, and the reduction of populations of other commercially important bivalves (such as scallops, Argopecten irradians, and northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria). The prey of C.maenas includes the young of bivalves and fish, although the effect of its predation on winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus is minimal. C.maenas can, however, have substantial negative impacts on local commercial and recreational fisheries, by preying on the young of species, such as oysters and the Dungeness crab, or competing with them <b>for</b> <b>resources.</b>|$|E
