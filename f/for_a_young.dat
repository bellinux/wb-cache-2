5|$|The film {{includes}} numerous cameo {{appearances of}} younger versions of characters {{from the previous}} films, including Jason Stryker (William Stryker's lobotomized telepathic son whom he keeps in cryogenic suspension).

5|$|Bart and Milhouse {{are thrilled}} {{to hear that}} a film version of their {{favorite}} comic book series, Radioactive Man, is in production. Rainier Wolfcastle, {{the star of the}} McBain films, is chosen to play Radioactive Man, and even more excitingly for the Springfield Elementary School children, the production moves to their town. A search is launched <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> actor to play Radioactive Man's sidekick, Fallout Boy, and Bart auditions. Bart does well, but is rejected for being an inch too short, and Milhouse gets the part, albeit reluctantly, under pressure from his greedy parents.|$|E

5|$|Prolific and versatile, Ruisdael {{depicted}} {{a wide variety}} of landscape subjects. From 1646 he painted Dutch countryside scenes of remarkable quality <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> man. After a trip to Germany in 1650, his landscapes took on a more heroic character. In his late work, conducted when he lived and worked in Amsterdam, he added city panoramas and seascapes to his regular repertoire. In these, the sky often took up two-thirds of the canvas. In total he produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after birth, Bertram {{declares}} {{war with}} Stewie for {{control over the}} playground. They confront {{each other in the}} playground with F-117 Nighthawks and AH-1 Cobras, firing numerous bullets at each other. After the air battle ends with no winners, Bertram resorts to biological warfare, and infects Stewie with chickenpox. After recovering, an enraged Stewie confronts Bertram, and they engage in a sword fight in the play area. Stewie eventually wins by disarming Bertram, and later that night, is seen suspiciously digging a hole with Christopher Moltisanti, but the hole is actually <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> tree. Stewie explains to Christopher that Bertram admitted defeat to Stewie and ran away.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the war Solti's luck changed dramatically. He was {{appointed}} musical director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1946. In normal circumstances this prestigious post would have been an unthinkable appointment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> and inexperienced conductor, but the leading German conductors such as Wilhelm Furtwängler, Clemens Krauss and Herbert von Karajan were prohibited from conducting pending the conclusion of denazification proceedings against them. Under Solti's direction, the company rebuilt its repertoire and began to recover its pre-war eminence. He benefited from the encouragement of the elderly Richard Strauss, in whose presence he conducted Der Rosenkavalier. Strauss was reluctant to discuss his own music with Solti, but gave him advice about conducting.|$|E

5|$|After an {{examination}} in May 1723, Murray was accepted into Christ Church, Oxford, having scored {{higher in the}} examination than any other King's Scholar that year. He was admitted as a commoner on 15 June 1723, and matriculated on 18 June; the records say that he came from Bath rather than Perth, because the person recording {{the names of the}} new students was unable to understand his Scottish accent. His older brother James was a barrister in Scotland, and his family decided that a career as a barrister was best for Murray. The Scottish Bar at the time was overcrowded, which made it difficult <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> barrister to build a reputation, yet qualifying for the English Bar was extremely expensive. Thanks to the patronage of Thomas Foley, 1st Baron Foley, who gave Murray £200 a year to live on, Murray could afford to study at the bar, and became a member of Lincoln's Inn on 23 April 1724.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1850, Honório Hermeto {{was back}} in Rio de Janeiro. He had found the months in Pernambuco excruciating. Being named provincial {{president}} {{would have been considered}} a great achievement <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> politician, but it added no luster to the reputation of a seasoned politician and a founding member of his party. Instead of being at the center of power, he was put in the humiliating position of having to submit to a cabinet composed of men with less political experience, such as Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Paulino Soares de Sousa (Honório Hermeto's colleague along with Rodrigues Torres in Coimbra) and Eusébio de Queirós. It was particularly grating being subordinated to Paulino Soares and Eusébio de Queirós, protégés whom Honório Hermeto had advanced during the 1830s. While in Pernambuco, Honório Hermeto's actions were frequently reviewed and overturned by the cabinet, often with Eusébio de Queirós leading the criticism.|$|E
5|$|Grace {{acquired}} an agent {{within a week}} of relocating to Los Angeles and enrolled in acting classes. She landed her first role in Rachel's Room, a 2001 web-based video series about the affairs inside a teenage girl's bedroom that was created by Dawson's Creek executive producer Paul Stupin. Her next role was on the 2002 television series Septuplets, which was cancelled before the first episode had aired. Her breakout role was on 2002's television movie Murder in Greenwich, based on the true story of 15-year-old Martha Moxley's murder. She was nominated <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Young</b> Artist Award for her portrayal of Moxley in the Best Performance in a TV Movie, Miniseries or Special – Leading Young Actress category, but lost to Clara Bryant for Tru Confessions. She went on to feature in minor roles on the television series , The Lyon's Den, Miracles, Like Family, Cold Case and , and the films Twelve Mile Road and Creature Unknown.|$|E

5|$|Here the key {{difference}} to notice {{is that there}} is no surface tension between the solid and the vapor for the second surface tension component. This is because of the assumption that the surface of air that is exposed is under the droplet and is the only other substrate in the system. Subsequently, the equation is then expressed as (1 – f). Therefore, the Cassie equation can be easily derived from the Cassie–Baxter equation. Experimental results regarding the surface properties of Wenzel versus Cassie–Baxter systems showed the effect of pinning <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Young</b> angle of 180 to 90°, a region classified under the Cassie–Baxter model. This liquid/air composite system is largely hydrophobic. After that point, a sharp transition to the Wenzel regime was found where the drop wets the surface, but no further than edges of the drop.|$|E
5|$|Higginbotham's {{desire to}} play regular first-team {{football}} led to him joining Derby County for a £2million fee – {{a large sum}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> player with just four top-flight appearances to his name. His decision to leave Manchester United was praised by the player he failed to displace, Denis Irwin. Higginbotham made his debut in a 2–2 draw with Southampton, and had a good start to his Derby career until he was substituted at half-time during his third appearance after struggling to contain Everton's Niclas Alexandersson. Manager Jim Smith soon switched to a new system without any full-backs but Higginbotham adapted well to playing on the left-side of a three-man defence. Derby avoid relegation out of the Premier League on the penultimate day of 2000–01 with a 1–0 victory over former his club Manchester United at Old Trafford.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Schumacher {{signed with}} Willi Weber's WTS Formula Three team. Funded by Weber, he {{competed in the}} German Formula 3 series, winning the title in 1990. He also won the Macau Grand Prix. At the end of 1990, along with his Formula 3 rivals Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Karl Wendlinger, he joined the Mercedes junior racing {{programme}} in the World Sports-Prototype Championship. This was unusual <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> driver: most of Schumacher's contemporaries would compete in Formula 3000 {{on the way to}} Formula One. However, Weber advised Schumacher that being exposed to professional press conferences and driving powerful cars in long distance races would help his career. In the 1990 World Sportscar Championship season, Schumacher won the season finale at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in a Sauber–Mercedes C11, and finished fifth in the drivers' championship despite only driving in three of the nine races. He continued with the team in the 1991 World Sportscar Championship season, winning again at the final race of the season at Autopolis in Japan with a Sauber–Mercedes-Benz C291, leading to a ninth-place finish in the drivers' championship. He also competed at Le Mans during that season, finishing 5th in a car shared with Karl Wendlinger and Fritz Kreutzpointner. In 1991, he competed in one race in the Japanese Formula 3000 Championship, finishing second.|$|E

5|$|In London, he {{had been}} {{introduced}} in 1881 to Constance Lloyd, daughter of Horace Lloyd, a wealthy Queen's Counsel. She happened to be visiting Dublin in 1884, when Wilde was lecturing at the Gaiety Theatre. He proposed to her, and they married on 29 May 1884 at the Anglican St James's Church, Paddington in London. Constance's annual allowance of £250 was generous <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> woman (equivalent to about £ in current value), but the Wildes had relatively luxurious tastes, and they had preached to others for so long {{on the subject of}} design that people expected their home to set new standards. No. 16, Tite Street was duly renovated in seven months at considerable expense. The couple had two sons, Cyril (1885) and Vyvyan (1886). Wilde became the sole literary signatory of George Bernard Shaw's petition for a pardon of the anarchists arrested (and later executed) after the Haymarket massacre in Chicago in 1886.|$|E
5|$|Julian offers Theo {{money to}} acquire transit papers <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> refugee named Kee, which Theo obtains from his cousin Nigel, a {{government}} minister {{who runs a}} state-sponsored collection of salvaged art from around the world. The transit papers require that the bearer must be accompanied, so Theo agrees to escort Kee {{in exchange for a}} large sum. Luke, a Fishes member, drives them and former midwife Miriam towards the coast to a boat. They are ambushed by an armed gang, and Julian is killed. Luke kills two police officers who stop their car, and they bury Julian in the forest as Theo breaks down crying over her death. The group ditches their car for another to escape to a Fishes safe house.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the care}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> bat comes from the mother. However, in monogamous species, the father plays a role. In addition, allo-suckling, where a female suckles young that is not hers, occurs in several species. This may serve to {{increase}} colony size in species where females return to their natal colony to breed. A young bat's ability to fly coincides {{with the development of}} an adult body and forelimb length. For the little brown bat, this occurs about eighteen days after birth. Weaning of young for most species takes place in under eighty days. The common vampire bat nurses its offspring beyond that and young vampire bats achieve independence later in life than other species. This is likely due to the species' blood-based diet which is difficult to obtain on a nightly basis.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Hitler {{had come}} into power, he had started to make plans to rebuild the chancellery. At the end of 1933 he {{contracted}} Paul Troost to renovate the entire building. Hitler appointed Speer, whose work for Goebbels had impressed him, to manage the building site for Troost. As Chancellor, Hitler had a residence in the building and came by every day to be briefed by Speer and the building supervisor {{on the progress of}} the renovations. After one of these briefings, Hitler invited Speer to lunch, to the architect's great excitement. Hitler evinced considerable interest in Speer during the luncheon, and later told Speer that he had been looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> architect capable of carrying out his architectural dreams for the new Germany. Speer quickly became part of Hitler's inner circle; he was expected to call on Hitler in the morning for a walk or chat, to provide consultation on architectural matters, and to discuss Hitler's ideas. Most days he was invited to dinner.|$|E
5|$|Susan was {{diagnosed}} with Multiple sclerosis in 2007. Two years prior, MS Australia pitched a storyline to the Neighbours team asking for a character to be diagnosed with MS and for them to then show the impact MS can have on a community. The society contacted a producer and discussed a possible storyline <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> character in her twenties who had a promising career and family ahead of her. In 2006, the society {{received a phone call}} from one of the writers who revealed that they had chosen to write an MS story into the show and they had selected Susan Kennedy to be the character that was going to be diagnosed. The society was initially disappointed, as Susan was older than the typical person diagnosed with the condition. However, they were pleased that a permanent character and not an extra was chosen. MS Australia attended a meeting with the Neighbours writers to help develop a realistic and true portrayal of the diagnosis, symptoms and treatments. On-screen Susan was seen displaying unusual symptoms, including black outs and loss of sight and sensation in her hands. She was then seen undergoing an MRI scan, before she {{was diagnosed}} with multiple sclerosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} of the story takes place {{primarily}} at Hikarizaka Private High School, a fictional school located in Japan.

The remaining half of the story takes place in the same city, after the conclusion of the first half. While the town's name was never directly mentioned, one can infer that the town's name is Hikarizaka based on the many companies and establishments that share this name.|$|E
