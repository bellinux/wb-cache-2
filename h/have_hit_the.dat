5|$|The Federal Emergency Management Agency and IEMA began doing {{preliminary}} damage assessments on March 5, 2012 {{in order}} to determine the need for public assistance. The storm damage in Harrisburg dominated national airwaves for several days, with both Anderson Cooper and Diane Sawyer doing special reports. Both the New York Times and Chicago Tribune published articles about the resilient history and nature of Harrisburg to rebound from the tornado and floods that <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> city since its founding in 1889.|$|E
5|$|A New Jersey {{hurricane}} is {{a tropical}} cyclone {{originating in the}} Atlantic Ocean that affects the state of New Jersey. Due to its location, few hurricanes <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> state directly, though numerous hurricanes have passed near or through New Jersey in its history. About every 10years, hurricanes approach the coastline close enough to send waves over barrier islands' dunes and into back bays. According to an estimate by meteorologist George Prouflis, the chances for a direct hit by a hurricane on the Jersey shore each year is 1 in 200.|$|E
5|$|Chappell's {{aggressive}} approach suited limited-overs cricket: {{he scored}} his runs at a strike-rate of 77 runs per hundred balls. The timing {{of his career}} limited him to 16 ODI matches, but he appeared {{in a number of}} historic fixtures such as the first ODI (at the MCG in 1971), the first World Cup final (at Lord's in 1975) and the first day/night match (during WSC, at VFL Park in 1978). He passed fifty in half of his innings with a top score of 86 at Christchurch in 1973–74. In his final season of international cricket, he scored 63 not out (from 65 balls) against the West Indies at the SCG to win the player of the match award; five days later he hit an unbeaten 60 from 50 balls in his penultimate ODI appearance, against England. As captain, he recorded six wins and five losses from 11 matches. He is also credited to <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> first ever six in an ODI match (which is in fact the first ODI match ever played).|$|E

5|$|Further {{discussion}} on altering the law {{took place in}} 1899, when several prominent cricketers supported an amendment similar to the 1888 proposal: the batsman would be out if the ball would <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> wicket, where it pitched was irrelevant. At a Special General Meeting of the MCC in 1902, Alfred Lyttelton formally proposed this amendment; the motion was supported by 259 votes to 188, but failed to secure the two-thirds majority required to change the laws. A. G. Steel was the principal opponent of the change, as he believed {{it would make the}} task of the umpires too difficult, but he later regretted his stance. Lyttelton's brother, Robert, supported the alteration and campaigned {{for the rest of his}} life to have the lbw law altered. As evidence that pad-play was increasing and needed to be curtailed, he cited the growing number of wickets which were falling lbw: the proportion rose from 2% of dismissals in 1870 to 6% in 1890, and 12% in 1923. In 1902, the proposed new law was tried in the Minor Counties Championship, but deemed a failure. An increase in the size of the stumps was one of several other rejected proposals at this time to reduce the dominance of batsmen over bowlers.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kiko {{was one of}} {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclones to <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> eastern coast of Mexico's Baja California peninsula during recorded history. The eleventh named storm of the 1989 Pacific hurricane season, Kiko formed out of a large mesoscale convective system on August25. Slowly tracking northwestward, the storm rapidly intensified into a hurricane early the next day. Strengthening continued until early August27, when Kiko reached its peak intensity with winds of 120mph (195km/h). The storm turned west at this time, and at around 0600UTC, the storm made landfall near Punta Arena at the southern tip of Baja California Sur. The hurricane rapidly weakened into a tropical storm later that day and further into a tropical depression by August28, shortly after entering the Pacific Ocean. The depression persisted for another day while tracking southward, before being absorbed by nearby Tropical Storm Lorena. Though Kiko made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane, its impact was relatively minor. Press reports indicated that 20 homes were destroyed and numerous highways were flooded by torrential rains.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of leg before wicket (lbw) is currently Law 36 in the Laws of Cricket, {{written by the}} Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Before a batsman can be dismissed lbw, the fielding team must appeal to the umpire. If the bowler delivers a no ball — an illegal delivery — the batsman cannot be out lbw under any circumstances. Otherwise, for the batsman to be adjudged lbw, the ball, if it bounces, must pitch in line with or on the off side of the wickets. Then the ball must strike part of the batsman's body without first touching his bat, {{in line with the}} wickets and have been going on to hit the stumps. The batsman may also be out lbw if, having made no attempt to hit the ball with his bat, he is struck outside the line of off stump by a ball that would <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> wickets. The umpire must assume that the ball would have continued on the same trajectory after striking the batsman, even if it would have bounced before hitting the stumps.|$|E

25|$|Whilst lbw {{is a valid}} form of {{dismissal}} in indoor cricket, it is a far rarer {{occurrence in}} indoor {{than it is in}} outdoor cricket.

25|$|If {{the ball}} strikes {{any part of}} the batsman's person (not {{necessarily}} the leg), and, in the umpire's judgement, the ball would <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> batsman's stumps but for this interception, then the batsman is out. The point of impact must be within line with the batsman's stumps and the bowler's stumps if the batsman is playing a stroke. The batsman can be given out if the ball strikes him outside the off stump, if the ball would <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> stumps and if the batsman is playing no stroke. The ball must not pitch outside the line of leg stump. Also, the ball cannot have made contact with the bat or glove that is touching the bat before hitting the batsman. If the ball hits the batsman either on the full or immediately after bouncing, the umpire is required to assume that the ball is travelling straight on, ignoring any spin, swing or other hard to predict movement that may have changed the direction of the ball if it had not hit the batsman.|$|E

25|$|In {{the evening}} session, England's bowlers, {{especially}} Matthew Hoggard, {{managed to find}} much more swing than the Australian bowlers had done, and ripped through the Australian top order.

25|$|On 23rd June 2017, in a Twenty20 {{match against}} South Africa, Jason Roy of England was given out obstructing the field, for {{changing}} {{the side of the}} pitch he was running on when returning from backing up. This caused the returned ball to hit him when he was out of his crease, when it could conceivably <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> stumps. The South African fielders immediately appealed for a dismissal. Responding to this, the on-field umpires called the ball dead and referred the decision to the third umpire, who gave Roy out.|$|E
25|$|The Iraqi {{military}} blamed ISIL for {{the attack}} despite reports suggesting that its artillery may also <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> neighborhood, saying that 61 bodies had been recovered {{at the site of}} a booby-trapped house which it described as “completely destroyed.” The statement added that “there is no hole or indication that was subjected to an air strike.” That account strongly contradicted much field reporting and the accounts of other officials. A provincial health official, for instance, told Reuters that wide swaths of the neighborhood were destroyed in fighting, “civil defense has extracted and buried 160 bodies up to this moment.” The Iraqi Civil Defense Department reported at least 137 bodies were recovered, but by 27 March, that number had risen to 531.|$|E
