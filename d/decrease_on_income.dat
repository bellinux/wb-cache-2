The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the economics effects that the Prestige oil spill over (2003) had on the Basque coastal fishing industry by means of a two-stage stochastic production frontier approach. The first stage is based on the econometric specification of a parametric production frontier based on pooled microeconomic data for vessels operating during the years 1999, 2003, 2004 and 2006. In the second a technical efficiency (TE) model is developed in order to explain the factors influencing on it, including the characteristics of fishing vessels and captains and fishing business itself. Finally, we are comparing the results obtained by the onestage (Coelli, 1992) and the two-stage (Battese and Coelli, 1995) estimation methods.

In this essay we will explain firstly a compilation of the most important literature about this topic. Then, we will explain the type of model estimated and the results of the estimation. After that, we will comment the impact of remittances on the different countries. At the end, our conclusion will be that it is not possible to obtain a single empirical result, because depending on different factors, remittances will affect significantly or not significantly <b>on</b> <b>income</b> distribution in a country.

One of our findings is that access to land has ceased {{to be the most}} important determinant of household income position, as farming and landless households have increasingly derived their incomes from non-farm economic activities. The association between land distribution and income distribution has weakened.

40|$|Likely {{policy changes}} leading towards further {{liberalisation}} of the Common Agricultural Policy would certainly influence farmers’ income and revenue risks. Thus, a question arises both for farmers and for policy makers about possible effects and necessary adjustments {{that should be}} made to face such changes. The paper examines long-term impacts of changes of key policy factors <b>on</b> <b>income</b> risk in Polish dairy farms. Deterministic linear programming farm model was used to estimate farm incomes and likely changes in production pattern, while stochastic simulation farm model was applied for examining income risk. The main results of this model chain are optimal production structures for farm types modelled in a set of assumed policy conditions as well as farm income and its volatility. Comparison of model results across scenarios allows to state that increase of milk quota and reduction of direct payments significantly <b>decrease</b> farm <b>incomes</b> <b>on</b> dairy farms in Poland. Full liberalisation of the Common Agricultural Policy and withdrawal of direct payments results with even more radical negative income effects especially in the cluster of smaller milk producers. Simulation indicates significantly increased risk of achieving low farm incomes.

40|$|China's {{widening}} regional {{income inequality}} coupled with its pronounced regional disparity in {{foreign direct investment}} stock since 1990 has claimed the attention of many scholars. While some researchers confirm regional disparity in China's foreign direct investment, others attribute the widening regional income inequality to this regional disparity. This paper thus assesses the impacts of China's stock of foreign direct investment <b>on</b> its regional <b>income</b> inequality using simultaneous equation model and the Shapley value regression-based decomposition approach. Our results suggest that China's stock of foreign direct investment has accounted for merely 2 % of its regional income inequality. Furthermore, the contribution ratio of per capita foreign direct investment stock to China's regional income inequality has relatively been on a steady decline since 2002. The decomposition results also reveal that provincial per capita physical assets account for over 50 % of the nation's income inequality and 65 % of the increases in income inequality since 1990. The other two important determinants of regional income inequality are province location and educational level. However, educational level is {{found to have a}} <b>decreasing</b> effect <b>on</b> regional <b>income</b> inequality. Foreign direct investment Income inequality Region...|$|R

40|$|Background: There {{has been}} {{considerable}} debate on whether productivity costs should be {{captured in the}} numerator or the denominator of the cost-effectiveness ratio. That debate cannot be resolved {{on the basis of}} theoretical arguments alone because the final choice also depends on what is incorporated in health-state valuations by respondents and how this influences outcomes. At the moment, little is known about whether the effects of ill health <b>on</b> <b>income</b> are included in health-state valuations, and how instructions on including or excluding the effects <b>on</b> <b>income</b> influence health-state valuations. Aim: To conduct an empirical study of health-state valuations to test: (i) whether or not respondents spontaneously include the effect of ill health <b>on</b> <b>income</b> and leisure time; (ii) the impact on the valuation of inclusion (or exclusion) of such effects; and (iii) the influence of explicit instructions on this matter. Methods: Three questionnaires were developed and administered to the general public. Health-state valuations were conducted by visual analogue scale scoring of three health states of differing severity taken from the EQ- 5 D. Version 1 had no directions regarding inclusion/exclusion of effects of ill health <b>on</b> <b>income.</b> Those respondents who spontaneously included effects <b>on</b> <b>income</b> were subsequently asked to value the same three health states again, excluding these effects. Version 2 had explicit instructions to incorporate the effects <b>on</b> <b>income.</b> Version 3 stated that income was assumed to not change as a result of ill health. Respondents for versions 2 and 3 were also questioned about inclusion of effects on leisure time. Results: Giving explicit instructions on the incorporation or exclusion of effects of ill health <b>on</b> <b>income</b> did not lead to significant differences in subsequent health-state valuations. In the absence of instruction, 36 % of respondents included and 64 % excluded effects <b>on</b> <b>income,</b> but the health-state valuations of the two groups were not significantly different. Eighty-four percent of respondents included the effects of ill health on leisure activities, and again this had no significant impact on the resulting health-state valuations. Conclusions: It appears that neither spontaneous differences in incorporation of effects <b>on</b> <b>income,</b> nor explicit instructions will yield significantly different health-state valuations. This may suggest that QALY measures are insensitive to concerns regarding effects <b>on</b> <b>income</b> even when these are (explicitly) incorporated, and these effects may therefore be best placed on the cost side of the cost-effectiveness ratio.

Current taxes <b>on</b> <b>income</b> are made up of: taxes <b>on</b> <b>income</b> and other current taxes.
