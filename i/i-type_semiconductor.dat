50|$|An {{intrinsic}} semiconductor, {{also called}} an undoped semiconductor or <b>i-type</b> <b>semiconductor,</b> {{is a pure}} semiconductor without any significant dopant species present. The number of charge carriers is therefore determined by {{the properties of the}} material itself instead of the amount of impurities. In intrinsic semiconductors the number of excited electrons and the number of holes are equal: n = p. This may even be the case after doping the semiconductor, though only if it is doped with both donors and acceptors equally. In this case, n = p still holds, and the semiconductor remains intrinsic, though doped.|$|E
