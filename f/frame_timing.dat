40|$|The {{evolution}} of digital technology has placed cartography {{in a dialog}} on questions concerning the new abilities, its form and prospective. The cartographic presentation in three dimensions has as a basic feature: the simulation with the "natural" ability of understanding the space. One {{of the problems that}} arose in virtual environments refers to the use of scale in relation to the analysis and the study of space. This relation of geographic analysis and cartographic tools is strictly defined in traditional cartography, but in the virtual cartographic environment the rules of optical understanding and measurement of space are defined by an arbitrary free moving of the sight, that prescribes the natural vision and therefore the perception of the specific space. In close relation with the cartographic motion is the cartographic visualization of the time and the relevant techniques: splitting of time, creation of motion <b>frames,</b> <b>timing,</b> rapidity, motion pattern, etc. The specific work describes, through specific examples that focus mainly on urban areas, methodological and technical approaches concerning the concept of time and scale problems in virtual cartography, but mainly contributes in the ongoing scientific dialogue concerning the theoretical documentation of Virtual Cartography.

In addition, the correct choice parameter values for the ptychographic reconstruction might be inherent to the data itself and can thus carry from experiment to experiment. To make Nanosurveyor more robust for such cases, it is desirable to expose configuration parameters as a runtime or heuristic feature rather than determined them at execution time, and take a more data-based approach where options are set based on feature detection.|$|R

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{absolute}} <b>frame</b> <b>timing</b> of BS is unknown to each RSS since the propagation delay is unknown to each RSS (refer Figure 1). Therefore, each RSS only estimates its relative downlink <b>frame</b> <b>timing</b> position at first. Next, each RSS transmits its own initial ranging sequence, which is locked on the estimated <b>frame</b> <b>timing,</b> to the BS with the network access request. Once BS receives the sequences from multiple RSSs, the BS should identify multiple RSSs and estimate every RSS’s timing offset and residual frequency offset independently. Finally, from the given estimate, the BS provides {{the timing and}} frequency feedback info to the identified RSSs with the network grant message. Consequently, it is crucial on the initial ranging process for BS to identify as many as RSSs and to estimate their timing and frequency offsets as accurate as possible.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{identify}} and authenticate entities in cyberspace such as users, computers, cell phones, smart cards, and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags is usually accomplished by having the entity demonstrate knowledge of a secret key. When the entity is portable and physically accessible, like an RFID tag, {{it can be difficult}} to secure given the memory, processing, and economic constraints. This work proposes to use unique patterns in the transmitted signals caused by manufacturing differences to identify and authenticate a wireless device such as an RFID tag. Both manufacturer identification and tag identification are performed on a population of 300 tags from three different manufacturers. A methodology to select features for identifying signals with high accuracy is developed and applied to passive RFID tags. The classifier algorithms K-Nearest Neighbors, Parzen Windows, and Support Vector Machines are investigated. The tag 2 ̆ 7 s manufacturer can be identified with 99. 93 % true positive rate. An individual tag is identified with 99. 8 % accuracy, which is better than previously published work. Using a Hidden Markov Model with <b>framed</b> <b>timing</b> and power data, the tag manufacturer can be identified with 97. 37 % accuracy and has a compact representation. An authentication system based on unique features of the signals is proposed assuming that the readers that interrogate the tags may be compromised by a malicious adversary. For RFID tags, a set of timing-only features can provide an accuracy of 97. 22 %, which is better than previously published work, is easier to measure, and appears to be more stable than power features...|$|R

The system {{was developed by}} Ampex {{at the request of}} the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) for a variety of sports broadcast uses. It was first demonstrated on the air on March 18, 1967, when “ABC’s Wide World of Sports” televised the “World Series of Skiing” from Vail, Colorado.http://www.digitrakcom.com/literature/HS-100%20Press.pdf The video was recorded on analog magnetic disc. The disc weighed 5 pounds/2.3 kg and rotated at 60rps, 3600rpm (50rps in Pal). One NTSC unit could record 30 seconds of video, PAL units 36 seconds. The video could then be played back in slow motion, stop action to freeze frame.http://www.vtoldboys.com/slomo_3.htm A more deluxe version, the HS-200, was introduced around 1971, and provided a large control console with variable speed playback. This made it ideal for instant replay for sports events and precise timing control in post production service. CBS-TV was the first to use the technique during live sportscasts, though it was quickly adopted by all American TV networks. The HS-200, which was an HS-100 connected to a control console when combined called the HS-200, had greater precise <b>frame</b> and <b>timing</b> control capability, lending itself to post-production applications like special effects and titles. The HS-200 had a <b>frame</b> accurate <b>timing</b> computer that enabled frame-accurate cuts and dissolve transitions by way of a two-input video switcher. Slow-motion sequences could likewise be programmed and could be [...] "triggered" [...] to begin via an external control pulse such as might come from an external VTR editor like the Ampex VR-2000 VTR with Editec. The HS-200 was the first system capable of single-frame video animation recording, using magnetic discs as opposed to videotape. The HS-200 also provided a readout with specific frame numbers showing from the 900 frames available (NTSC version.) Sequences could be triggered to start from any of these 900 frames with frame-accurate repeatability for creative fine tuning of sequence start and end points.|$|R

This paper describes an illumination-based synchronization method derived from the phase-locked loop (PLL) algorithm. Incident light to a vision sensor from an intensity-modulated illumination source serves as the reference signal for synchronization. Analog and digital computation within the vision sensor forms a PLL to regulate the output signal, which corresponds to the vision <b>frame</b> <b>timing,</b> to be synchronized with the reference.

50|$|Vertical {{synchronization}} eliminates this by <b>timing</b> <b>frame</b> buffer fills {{to coincide}} with the vertical blanking interval, thus ensuring that only whole frames are seen on-screen. Software such as video games and computer aided design (CAD) packages often allow vertical synchronization as an option, because it delays the image update until the vertical blanking interval. This produces a small penalty in latency, because the program has to wait until the video controller has finished transmitting the image to the display before continuing. Triple buffering reduces this latency significantly.|$|R
30|$|The long {{preamble}} {{used in the}} OFDM systems, on {{the other}} hand, is not applicable to the FBMC systems. The presence of cyclic prefix in OFDM isolates successive symbol frames and also allows some tolerance with respect to timing phase offset. In the FBMC systems, the extended length of the subcarrier filters (equivalently, the prototype filter) results in significant overlap of successive symbol frames. Moreover, because {{of the absence of}} any guard interval between successive symbol <b>frames,</b> the <b>timing</b> phase in FBMC system cannot tolerate any significant offset. To deal with these issues, we propose to use a long preamble which is isolated from the short preamble and also from the payload of the packet. This is done by adding sufficient guard time/null space after the short preamble and before the payload. More detail of the proposed packet format is presented in Section 3.|$|R
