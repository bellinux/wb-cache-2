The {{frame synchronization}} process is explained, and test data {{on the performance of}} <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizers</b> and <b>frame</b> synchronization codes are presented. The application of frame synchronization methods in specific cases is considered in the light of code selection, frame length, and data recovery...|$|R
5000|$|A {{variant of}} the time base {{corrector}} is the <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizer</b> which allows devices that cannot be [...] "steered" [...] by an advanced sync signal to also be time base corrected and/or timed into a system. Satellites, microwave transmitters and other broadcast signals as well as consumer VTRs cannot be sent an advance sync signal. A <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizer</b> stores at least a full frame of video. If the buffer over or under fills, the Frame Sync will hold the last good frame of video until another full frame's worth of video is received. Usually this is undetectable to viewers.|$|E
50|$|Differential coding is not {{the only}} way to deal with a phase ambiguity. The other popular {{technique}} is to use syncwords for this purpose. That is, if a <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizer</b> detects repeated inverted sync-words, it inverts the whole stream. This method is used in DVB-S.|$|E
50|$|A method {{illustrated}} above {{can deal}} with a data stream inversion (it is called 180° ambiguity). Sometimes it is enough (e.g. if BPSK is used or if other ambiguities are detected by other circuits, such as a Viterbi decoder or a <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizer)</b> and sometimes it isn't.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{personal}} computers, being multi-application devices, a {{video server}} {{is designed for}} one purpose; provisioning video, often for broadcasters. A professional-grade video server performs recording, storage, and playout of multiple video streams without any degradation of the video signal. Broadcast quality video servers often store {{hundreds of hours of}} compressed audio and video (in different codecs), play out multiple and synchronised simultaneous streams of video by, and offer quality interfaces such as SDI for digital video and XLR for balanced analog audio, AES/EBU digital audio and also Time Code. A genlock input is usually provided to provide a means of synchronizing with the house reference clock, thereby avoiding the need for timebase correction or <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizers.</b>|$|R

This will include how to configure tests that will determine system performance under “real time” conditions such as multipath fading and Doppler shifting. The paper will analyze a telemetry receiving system and define tests for each part of the system. This will include tests for verification of the antenna system. Also included, will be tests for verification of the receiver/combiner system. The paper will further discuss how adding PCM simulation capabilities to the signal simulator will allow testing of <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizers</b> and decomutation equipment...|$|R
50|$|The frame {{synchronization}} pattern is a known binary pattern which repeats at a regular interval within the PCM stream. The <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizer</b> recognizes this pattern and aligns the data into minor frames or sub-frames. Typically the frame sync pattern {{is followed by}} a counter (sub-frame ID) which dictates which minor or sub-frame in the series is being transmitted. This becomes increasingly important in the decommutation stage where all data is deciphered as to what attribute was sampled. Different commutations require a constant awareness of which section of the major frame is being decoded.|$|E
5000|$|Since vision mixers combine various video signals such as VTRs and {{professional}} video cameras, {{it is very}} important that all these sources are in proper synchronization with one another. In professional analog facilities all the equipment is [...] "genlocked" [...] with black and burst or tri-level sync from a video-signal generator. The signals which cannot be synchronized (either because they originate outside the facility or because the particular equipment doesn’t accept external sync) must go through a <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizer.</b> Some vision mixers have internal “frame-syncs” or they can be a separate piece of equipment, such as a [...] "time base corrector". If the mixer is used for video editing, the editing console (which usually controls the vision mixer remotely) must also be synched. Most larger vision mixers divide the control panel from the actual hardware that performs the mixer functions because of noise, temperature and cable length considerations. With such mixers, the control panel is located in the production control room, while the main unit, to which all cables are connected, is often located in a machine room alongside the other hardware.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>Frame</b> <b>Synchronizer</b> {{is used in}} television/video {{production}} to synchronize the timing of a video source signal to coincide with a central timing reference (usually a color black signal aka [...] "black burst" [...] that is distributed throughout a facility). The synchronizer accomplishes this by (first digitizing in an analog scenario and) writing the incoming digital video into a frame buffer memory using {{the timing of the}} sync information contained in that video signal. Simultaneously the digital video is being read back out of the buffer by an independent timing system that is [...] "genlocked" [...] to the house timing reference. As a result, the timing or alignment of the video frame can be adjusted so that the start of the upper left corner scan line of the image occurs simultaneously on all video equipment in the work flow. This is an absolute requirement for both analog and digital systems in order to perform video effects or glitch-free source switching. Note that frame synchronization can only be performed within a given television line standard. A synchronizer will not convert an NTSC signal to a PAL signal or vice versa; it takes a Video Standards Converter to do that.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method to}} synchronize codeword frames without making use of attached synchronization markers (ASMs). Instead, the synchronizer identifies the code structure present in the received symbols, by operating the decoder {{for a handful of}} iterations at each possible symbol offset and forming an appropriate metric. This method is computationally more complex and doesn't perform as well as <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizers</b> that utilize an ASM; nevertheless, the new <b>synchronizer</b> acquires <b>frame</b> synchronization in about two seconds when using a 600 kbps software decoder, and would take about 15 milliseconds on prototype hardware. It also eliminates the need for the ASMs, which is an attractive feature for short uplink codes whose coding gain would be diminished by the overheard of ASM bits. The lack of ASMs also would simplify clock distribution for the AR 4 JA low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and adds a small amount to the coding gain as well (up to 0. 2 dB) ...|$|R
40|$|Pilot symbol {{assisted}} modulation (PSAM) is {{a method}} to reduce the effects of fading in mobile communications by periodically inserting known symbols in the data stream. The receiver uses the pilot symbols to estimate channel state information. In order to do this, the pilot symbols must first {{be located in the}} noisy received sequence. This paper investigates the performance of a class of PSAM <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizers</b> which have the form of a quadratic correlation filter and threshold test. Computer simulations are used to show that these synchronizers can be designed to have a robust performance over a large range of Doppler spreads and SNR, to achieve an arbitrarily high probability of correct acquisition, and to maintain low computational complexity.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 16, 1986 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaDue to the {{increasing}} complexity of systems on which telemetry is used, the method of embedding a data stream within the main PCM data stream is becoming a popular means of acquiring subsystem data. However, this technique increases {{the complexity of the}} decommutating requirement in that the embedded stream must first be extracted from the main stream and then decommutated. One obvious solution would be to re-serialize the extracted data stream to be decommutated by a second set of <b>frame</b> and subframe <b>synchronizers.</b> This method suffers from increased system cost due to the additional hardware needed solely to support the embedded data stream. This paper will address an alternate method developed by Loral Instrumentation and an actual application at General Dynamics, Convair Division.

40|$|This thesis has two parts: (1) Optimum Fume Synchronization and (2) Reduced-Complexity Demodulation of CPM. ^ The {{problem of}} frame {{synchronization}} is {{to locate the}} boundaries between frames at the receiver. Such information is necessary, for example, in communication systems with block-based error-control coding and pilot-symbol assisted modulation (PSAM). In our study, the optimum decoder-assisted <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizer</b> is proposed for Markov modulations in AWGN channels. The proposed <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizer</b> can be applied for time-varying channels with slow-fading or phase/frequency instabilities, when combined with per-survivor-processing. The time-varying channel is jointly estimated by per-survivor-processing as frame synchronization proceeds. The proposed <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizer</b> is robust to channel variation and shows performance improvement due to coding gain. ^ Continuous phase modulation (CPM) allows the transmission of many bits per symbol while providing both good bit error probability (BER) and bandwidth performance. We develop a class of suboptimal symbol-by-symbol demodulators for continuous phase modulated (CPM) signals. The proposed demodulators provide soft-outputs to the outer code and offer a reduced-complexity symbol-by-symbol detection in which the numbers of matched filters and states are appreciably reduced. We also apply the proposed demodulation scheme to iterative decoding of serially concatenated CPM. ...|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 16, 1986 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaThe Boeing Commercial Airplane Company {{presently}} uses an Airborne Data Analysis and Monitor System (ADAMS) {{to support}} extensive qualification testing on new and modified commercial aircraft. The ADAMS system consists of subsystems controlled by independent processors which preprocess serial PCM data, perform application-specific processing, provide graphic display of data, and manage mass storage resources. Setup and control information is passed between processors using the Ethernet protocol on a fiber optic network. Tagged data is passed between processors using a data bus with networking characteristics. During qualification tests, data are dynamically selected, analyses performed, and results recorded. Decisions to proceed or repeat tests {{are made in}} real time on the aircraft. Instrumentation in present aircraft includes up to 3700 sensors, with projections for 5750 sensors in the next generation. Concurrently, data throughput rates are increasing, and data preprocessing requirements are becoming more complex. Fairchild Weston Systems, Inc., under contract to Boeing, has developed an Acquisition Interface Assembly (AIA) which accepts multiple streams of PCM data, controls recording and playback on analog tape, performs high speed data preprocessing, and distributes the data to the other ADAMS subsystems. The AIA processes one to three streams {{in any of the}} standard IRIG PCM formats using programmable bit, <b>frame</b> and subframe <b>synchronizers.</b> Data from ARINC buses with embedded measurement labels, bus ID’s, and time tags may also be processed by the AIA. Preprocessing is accomplished by two high-performance Distributed Processing Units (DPU) operating in either pipeline or parallel environments. The DPU’s perform concatenation functions, number system conversions, engineering unit conversions, and data tagging for distribution to the ADAMS system. Time information, from either a time code generator or tape playback, may be merged with data with a 0. 1 msec resolution. Control and status functions are coordinated by an embedded processor, and are accessible to other ADAMS processors via both the Ethernet interface and a local operator’s terminal. Because the AIA assembly is used in aircraft, the entire functional capability has been packaged in a 14 -inch high, rack-mountable chassis with EMI shielding. The unit has been designed for high temperature, high altitude, vibrating environments. The AIA will be a key element in aircraft qualification testing at Boeing well into the next generation of airframes, and specification, design, development, and implementation of the AIA has been carried out with the significance of that fact in mind...|$|R
40|$|Communications systems which {{transfer}} blocks ("frames") of data {{must use}} a marker ("frame synchronization pattern") for identifying where a block begins. A technique ("frame synchronization strategy") {{is used to}} locate {{the start of each}} frame and maintain synchronization as additional blocks are processed. A device which strips out the frame synchronization pattern [FSP] and provides an "end of frame" pulse is called a <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizer.</b> As clock and data errors are introduced into the system, the start-of-block marker becomes displaced and/or corrupted. The capability of the <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizer</b> to stay locked to the pattern under these conditions is a figure of merit for the frame synchronization strategy. It is important to select a strategy which will stay locked nearly all the time at bit error rates where the data is usable. ("Bit error rate" [BER] is the fraction of binary bits which are inverted by passage through a communication system.) The fraction of frames that are discarded because the <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizer</b> is not locked is called "Percent Data Loss" or "Packet Data Loss rate" [PDL]. A general approach for accurately predicting PDL given BER was developed in Theoretical Percent Data Loss Calculation and Measurement Accuracy, T. P. Kelly, LESC- 30554, December 1992. Kelly gave a solution in terms of matrix equations, and only addressed "level" channel encoding. This paper goes on to give a closed-form polynomial solution for the most common class of <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizer</b> strategies, and will also address "mark" and "space" (differential) channel encoding, and burst error environments. The paper is divided into four sections and follows a logically ordered presentation, with results developed before they are evaluated. However, most readers will derive the greatest benefit from this paper by treating the results as reference material. The result developed for differential encoding can be extended to other applications (like block codes) where the probability is needed that a block contains only a certain number of errors...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{orthogonal}} frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), most papers define OFDM symbol synchronization as frame synchronization. In this paper, a frame {{is defined as a}} block of several OFDM symbols in the time dimension. The main contribution of this work is to propose a novel, lowcomplexity, frame synchronization method for multi-carrier systems that does not require any transmission overhead; this increases the channel capacity, power and bandwidth efficiency. Also, it enables a flexible multiple-access scheme to be implemented in OFDM, whereby each user can have different frame size. The proposed frame synchronization method is compared with a conventional method using a preamble. Power compensation and frame averaging techniques are proposed to improve the performance of the <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizer.</b> The performance of the proposed <b>frame</b> <b>synchronizer</b> is evaluated over a Rayleigh fading channel for orthogonal frequency division multiple-access (OFDMA) and multi-carrier codedivision multiple-access (MC-CDMA) systems...|$|E

Functions performed by this third generation device include true and inverted 64 bit marker correlation with programmable error tolerances, programmable frame length and marker patterns, programmable search-check-lock-flywheel acquisition strategy, slip detection, and CRC error detection.
