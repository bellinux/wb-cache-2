Wellington's orders left Beresford full discretion to fight Soult or to retreat and he was personally inclined to the latter course of action. However, when Beresford met with Blake and Castaños, the two most senior Spanish generals, at Valverde on 14 May, <b>he</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>himself</b> to be persuaded that the numerical superiority the Allied army had over Soult justified risking a battle. The Allied leaders consequently agreed to concentrate at Albuera, which was the location chosen by Wellington as best suited for an attempt to resist any French advance to relieve Badajoz.|$|E

At Bonin's apartment, Wells was bound, raped, beaten about the face and torso by both men, then informed he was to be murdered before he was strangled to death with his own T-shirt.

25|$|It {{was during}} this period of recuperation, however, that Goddard began to produce some of his most {{important}} work. As his symptoms subsided, <b>he</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>himself</b> to work an hour per day with his notes made at Princeton. In the technological and manufacturing atmosphere of Worcester, patents were considered essential, not only to protect original work, but as documentation of first discovery. He began to see the importance of his ideas as intellectual property, and thus began to secure those ideas before someone else did—and he would have to pay to use them. In May 1913, he wrote concerning his first rocket patent applications. His father brought them to a patent firm in Worcester, who helped him to refine his ideas for consideration. Goddard's first patent application was submitted in October 1913.|$|E
25|$|In April 1712 he left Harwich for Rotterdam to {{lead the}} British troops {{taking part in the}} war.

In July 1712 Ormonde advised Prince Eugene that he could no longer support the siege of Quesnoy and that he was withdrawing the British troops from the action and instead intended to take possession of Dunkirk. The Dutch were so exasperated at the withdrawal of the British troops that they closed the towns of Bouchain on Douai to British access {{despite the fact that they}} had plenty of stores and medical facilities available. Ormonde took possession of Ghent and Bruges as well as Dunkirk in order to ensure his troops were adequately provided for. On 15 April 1713 he became Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk.|$|E

25|$|At an Anglo-French {{conference at}} Calais (6 July) Joffre and Kitchener, who {{was opposed to}} “too vigorous” offensives, reached a {{compromise}} on “local offensives on a vigorous scale”, and Kitchener agreed to deploy New Army divisions to France. An inter-Allied conference at Chantilly (7 July, including Russian, Belgian, Serb and Italian delegates) agreed on coordinated offensives. However, Kitchener now came to support the upcoming Loos offensive. He travelled to France for talks with Joffre and Millerand (16 August). The French leaders believed Russia might sue for peace (Warsaw had fallen on 4 August). Kitchener (19 August) ordered the Loos offensive to proceed, despite the attack being on ground not favoured by French or Haig (then commanding First Army). The Official History later admitted that Kitchener hoped to be appointed Supreme Allied Commander. Liddell Hart speculated that this was why <b>he</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>himself</b> to be persuaded by Joffre. New Army divisions first saw action at Loos in September 1915.|$|E

However, Porus turned indignant on the very sight of his nemesis and tossed a spear at him in furor without listening to his proposal forcing him to take flight on his steed. In such manner many other messengers, dispatched by the determined Alexander were spurned, till at last Meroes, a personal friend of Porus convinced him to listen to the message of Alexander. Overpowered by thirst, the weary Porus finally dismounted his War-Elephant and demanded water. After being refreshed, <b>he</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>himself</b> to be taken to Alexander.

25|$|In {{the first}} Test, played at Edgbaston, Hobbs opened the batting with MacLaren but was dismissed, {{from the first}} ball he received, by Charlie Macartney for a duck. However, the match was a low-scoring one on a pitch which made batting difficult, and Australia left England needing 105 to win. The task was not easy in the conditions, but Hobbs, this time opening the batting with C. B. Fry, hit 62 not out. He scored quickly off all the bowlers and England passed the target without losing a wicket. This innings meant that he had scored 919 runs {{before the end of}} May, but he failed to emulate W. G. Grace's {{achievement}} of scoring 1,000 runs in May when Nottinghamshire batted throughout the day when Surrey played them on 31 May. England lost the second Test by nine wickets, their team much changed to the bafflement of critics and spectators, and Hobbs scored just 19 and 9. The home side also lost the third Test. Hobbs scored 12 and 30, the latter the highest score of the innings, but was involved in controversy in the first innings when he appeared to change his mind when about to walk off after apparently hitting his own wicket. The umpire ruled him not out, to the fury of the Australians who loudly protested for some time. Hobbs was out to a very straightforward delivery almost immediately after; some critics, including the Australian captain, believed <b>he</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>himself</b> to be dismissed because he thought the umpire was wrong, but Hobbs later wrote that the incident unsettled him and he lost concentration.|$|E

The talisman that Mina gave Soma is able to slow the transformation, {{enabling}} Arikado to arrive in time to inform Soma that the [...] "Mina" [...] that Celia killed was a doppelgänger. This aborts the transformation, but a soul exits Soma and enters the doppelgänger, which takes on the appearance of Dmitrii. Dmitrii states that when Soma defeated him <b>he</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>himself</b> to be absorbed, wishing to use his powers to copy Soma's ability of dominance over the souls of Dracula's minions. [...] He then leaves with Celia to absorb the souls of many powerful demons and monsters {{in an attempt to}} increase his power. Soma and Arikado chase after the two, and find them in the castle's basement. Dmitrii, using Celia as a sacrifice, seals Arikado's powers, and engages Soma. However, his soul is unable to bear the strain of controlling the demons he has absorbed, and they erupt out of him, combining into one gargantuan creature called Menace. Soma manages to defeat it, but the souls that composed the demon begin to fall under Soma's dominance. He becomes overwhelmed and rejects them, fleeing from the castle with Arikado. Soma is conflicted over the present situation, as he believes that it was his responsibility to become the dark lord and that the events of the game were a result of him not accepting this responsibility, but Arikado convinces him that his fate is not fixed. Soma then shares a tender moment with Mina, much to the amusement of his onlooking friends.|$|E
500|$|Elgar {{was devastated}} {{by the loss of}} his wife. With no public demand for new works, and {{deprived}} of Alice's constant support and inspiration, <b>he</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>himself</b> to be deflected from composition. His daughter later wrote that Elgar inherited from his father a reluctance to [...] "settle down to work on hand but could cheerfully spend hours over some perfectly unnecessary and entirely unremunerative undertaking", a trait that became stronger after Alice's death. For {{much of the rest of}} his life, Elgar indulged himself in his several hobbies. Throughout his life he was a keen amateur chemist, sometimes using a laboratory in his back garden. He even patented the [...] "Elgar Sulphuretted Hydrogen Apparatus" [...] in 1908. He enjoyed football, supporting Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C., for whom he composed an anthem, [...] "He Banged the Leather for Goal", and in his later years he frequently attended horseraces. His protégés, the conductor Malcolm Sargent and violinist Yehudi Menuhin, both recalled rehearsals with Elgar at which he swiftly satisfied himself that all was well and then went off to the races. In his younger days, Elgar had been an enthusiastic cyclist, buying Royal Sunbeam bicycles for himself and his wife in 1903 (he named his [...] "Mr. Phoebus"). As an elderly widower, he enjoyed being driven about the countryside by his chauffeur. In November and December 1923, he took a voyage to Brazil, journeying up the Amazon to Manaus, where he was impressed by its opera house, the Teatro Amazonas. Almost nothing is recorded about Elgar's activities or the events that he encountered during the trip, which gave the novelist James Hamilton-Paterson considerable latitude when writing Gerontius, a fictional account of the journey.|$|E
