Detailed positions of maximum and minimum temperature varied between cabinet types. In <b>chest</b> <b>freezers</b> 95 % of the maximum temperature positions were located in the top layer and 95 % of the minimum temperature positions were located in the middle layer of the cabinets. In full door frozen cabinets the maximum temperature position was in the majority of cases on the top shelf (64 %) with most maximum packs being {{at the front of the}} top shelf (53 %). In the chilled full door cabinets 94 % of the maximum temperature packs were situated at the front of the cabinet. In open fronted cabinets the majority of maximum temperature packs (97 %) were located at the front of the cabinet, the largest number (60 %) being at the front of the base of the cabinet. In well cabinets the majority of maximum temperature packs (81 %) were located in the top layer of the cabinet and the majority (91 %) of minimum temperature packs were located in the bottom of the cabinet. Large differences in energy consumed by cabinets of similar size and temperature performance were found indicating that large reductions in energy and CO 2 emissions could be achieved by selection of the most efficient cabinets. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd and IIR...|$|R

A newer method is to add liquid nitrogen to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by Heston Blumenthal as ideal for home cooks, is to add dry ice to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes. Some ice cream recipes call for making a custard, folding in whipped cream, and immediately freezing the mixture.

One such method {{is by the}} use of a <b>chest</b> <b>freezer</b> for the storage of frozen food. This investigation considers different loads and design parameters {{for the development of a}} <b>chest</b> <b>freezer</b> using R 134 a as the working fluid. Experimental designs of an evaporator coil, condenser coil and capillary tube are investigated through the development of storage periods in terms of steady state and cyclic performance, by optimising the quantity of refrigerant charge, with strict adherence to the standards and requirement for maintaining an internal temperature of - 23 °C at 43 °C ambient. Cyclic load performance tests optimise the performance of individual components selected for the design of a <b>chest</b> <b>freezer.</b> The system selection has a highly balanced performance with R 134 a and showed 118 kJ/kg cooling capacity with 8. 42 coefficient of performance (COP). By the replacement of R 134 a, temperatures of - 23 °C are maintained inside the freezer cabinet with low power consumption and an increase in the net refrigerating effect, which in turn increases the COP.

40|$|The {{effects of}} cold storage in a {{household}} refrigeration at 4 ºC for up to 7 days on lipid oxidation of raw and cooked leg and shoulder meat cuts from beef, camel, Najdi lamb and Merino lamb as well as thigh and breast chicken were studied by TBA test and by Gas Chromatography for aldehydes compounds.

Lipid oxidation proceeded at a moderate speed during storage up to 7 days in refrigerated raw beef and lamb meat cuts and chicken thigh. Cooking of all samples before cold storage caused the highest increase in lipid oxidation in all meat cuts studied specially lamb meat and chicken thigh.

50|$|While the United States usually {{finances}} wars using {{a combination}} of direct contemporaneous taxes, debt, and money creation, with taxation comprising a relatively small fraction of expenses, the Korean War was financed mainly via taxation. This focus on taxation was significant change in economic policy, as President Harry S. Truman focused on maintaining a balanced budget. He favored pay-as-you-go taxation and Congress supported this; in 1950, the House of Representatives, in an overwhelming majority, voted 328 to 7 to raise personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, and excise taxes. Also, capital taxation reached their highest levels {{in the history of the}} US during the Korean War, rising to an average of about 62 percent. Sin and luxury taxes, such as those on furs, jewelry, and coin-operated gambling machines were increased as well and new taxes on television and <b>household</b> <b>freezers,</b> which represented goods that used materials and manufacturing facilities that were maybe important for the war effort. Taxes were again increased under the Revenue Act of 1951. Although the Revenue Acts during the Korean War were unable to prevent a deficit in the federal budget, the deficits produced were manageable, averaging about 6.5 percent of revenues on a monthly basis during the war. Through such measures, President Truman depended mostly on taxation and a decrease in non-military expenses, rather than from borrowing from the public or money creation policies.|$|R

40|$|Freezing of herring (Clupea harengus) {{for human}} {{consumption}} is increasing in the Nordic herring industry, either onboard the fishing vessels or right after landing. The quality of frozen herring as a raw material does not only depend on the frozen storage conditions applied, but also on compositional features, something which in turn can vary with season and catching ground. To unravel the link between biological variations, basic muscle composition, and sensory properties of frozen herring, a unique herring raw material was caught by commercial fishing vessels at three locations: around Iceland, outside the Norwegian coast, and in Kattegat/Skagerrak. The samplings were done according to a specific scheme and conducted over several seasons and 2 years. The herring was converted into butterfly fillets, packed in cardboard boxes, frozen, and then stored at 20 degrees C or 80 degrees C for up to 18 mo. The sensory quality was characterized by objective sensory profiling. It was shown that two generalized sensory variables could be defined from a principal component analysis of the sensory data. Except for the expected pronounced effect from storage time, the most distinct variation followed the lipid content, which in turn varied with season. An unexpected conclusion was that catching location only had a minor affect on the changes in sensory quality of herring during frozen storage. Knowledge about how season and catching location affect herring during frozen storage will be useful for optimizing the utilization of herring for frozen storage {{for human consumption}}. Practical Application: The {{results of this study}} constitute important information for the herring processing industry when handling raw materials with different geographical and seasonal history. The reported information on a highly equal sensory quality of geographically diverse raw materials will give consumers and retailers valuable knowledge on the changes in eating quality to expect after long-term frozen storage under conditions similar to <b>household</b> <b>freezers</b> or refrigerated counters in supermarkets...|$|R
