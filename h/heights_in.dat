40|$|The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} order to {{investigate}} the effects of alpha and beta adrenoceptors agonists on the neuromuscular blockade induced by certain drugs; namely, pancuronium, enflurane, magnesium and dantrolene in the dog fast and slow muscles. The degree of neuromuscular blockade was monitored by the twitch height of both muscles elicited by indirectly electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve, once every 10 sec. The results were as follows: 1) Twitch <b>height</b> <b>in</b> fast (anterior tibial) and slow (superficial digital flexor) muscle partially blocked by pancuronium drip infusion was increased by the administration of epinephrine. In the presence of phentolamine, epinephrine did not increase the twitch <b>height</b> <b>in</b> both muscles. The results demonstrated that stimulation of alpha adrenoceptor has a facilitatory effect on neuromuscular transmission. 2) Epinephrine increased the twitch <b>height</b> <b>in</b> fast muscle and decreased it in slow muscle partially blocked by magnesium drip infusion or during enflurane inhalation. The epinephrine-induced increase <b>in</b> the twitch <b>height</b> <b>in</b> fast muscle was completely suppressed by pretreatment with phentolamine. The epinephrine-induced decrease <b>in</b> the twitch <b>height</b> <b>in</b> slow muscle was completely suppressed by pretreatment with propranolol. 3) During enflurane inhalation, epinephrine increased the twitch <b>height</b> <b>in</b> both muscles partially blocked by pancuronium drip infusion. The epinephrine-induced increase <b>in</b> the twitch <b>height</b> <b>in</b> both muscles was completely suppressed by pretreatment with phentolamine. 4) After the stable dantrolene-induced partial neuromuscular blockade, epinephrine decreased the twitch <b>height</b> <b>in</b> slow muscle but did not alter it in fast muscle. The epinephrine-induced decrease <b>in</b> twitch <b>height</b> <b>in</b> slow muscle was completely suppressed by pretreatment with propranolol. 5) It was clarified that the epinephrine-induced increase <b>in</b> the twitch <b>height</b> <b>in</b> fast muscle partially blocked is mainly due to the stimulation of α 1 and α 2 adrenoceptors. On the other hand, the appearance of epinephrine-induced decrease in slow muscle partially blocked is mainly caused by the stimulation of β 2 adrenoceptors...|$|R
30|$|There {{was not a}} {{consistent}} effect of tidal height on birds. Specifically, tidal height {{was not a significant}} factor on its own, but there was sometimes a significant interaction with month, indicating that the effect of tide, when it occurred, was inconsistent from season to season (see all Tables). Tidal height did not appear to affect bird richness. Shorebird abundance (Table 3) increased with tidal <b>height</b> <b>in</b> October, but decreased with tidal <b>height</b> <b>in</b> May. Gull abundance (Table 8) also increased with tidal <b>height</b> <b>in</b> October, but had a negative association with tidal <b>height</b> <b>in</b> August.

He concluded that poor people die younger. This extended into his study in 1829 that reasoned the cause for shorter <b>heights</b> <b>in</b> poorer people was the result of inadequate money to provide proper nutrition. Villermé's work on height is considered the first study in auxological epidemiology.|$|E

5|$|The empire's legacy {{includes}} many monuments spread over South India, {{the best known}} of which is the group at Hampi. Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in Hindu temples construction. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new <b>heights</b> <b>in</b> Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form. The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian history that transcended regionalism by promoting Hinduism as a unifying factor.|$|E

5|$|A route {{popular with}} {{experienced}} hillwalkers starts at Torlundy, {{a few miles}} north-east of Fort William on the A82 road, and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ("CMD Arête") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a head for <b>heights.</b> <b>In</b> common with other approaches {{on this side of}} the mountain, it has the advantage of giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face, which are hidden from the Pony Track.|$|E
5|$|Identical to its {{predecessor}} however, {{the core of}} the gameplay is centred on the player's ability to make Robbit jump and shoot projectiles at enemies. Robbit can jump up to three times (as indicated by the new interface), allowing him to reach extreme <b>heights</b> <b>in</b> the game. As with the first instalment, Jumping Flash! 2 introduced new in-game power ups and weapons such as a powerful laser beam, missiles and trip mines. In addition to the new weapons, the player can find and use the older weapons in form of fireworks to deal massive damage to enemies. Other weapons include cherry bombs, rockets and Roman candles.

5|$|Deserts {{present a}} very {{challenging}} environment for animals. Not {{only do they}} require food and water but {{they also need to}} keep their body temperature at a tolerable level. In many ways birds are the most able to do this of the higher animals. They can move to areas of greater food availability as the desert blooms after local rainfall and can fly to faraway waterholes. In hot deserts, gliding birds can remove themselves from the over-heated desert floor by using thermals to soar in the cooler air at great <b>heights.</b> <b>In</b> order to conserve energy, other desert birds run rather than fly. The cream-colored courser flits gracefully across the ground on its long legs, stopping periodically to snatch up insects. Like other desert birds it is well-camouflaged by its coloring and can merge into the landscape when stationary. The sandgrouse is an expert at this and nests on the open desert floor dozens of kilometers (miles) away from the waterhole it needs to visit daily. Some small diurnal birds are found in very restricted localities where their plumage matches the color of the underlying surface. The desert lark takes frequent dust baths which ensures that it matches its environment.|$|E
5|$|For {{the spring}} 1797 campaign, Bonaparte {{organized}} his army into eight divisions {{of which the}} 3rd Division under Sérurier counted 6,543 soldiers. In the Battle of Valvasone on 16 March, Bonaparte drove back the rear guard of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen. During the operation Sérurier's division was in reserve, but in the subsequent advance {{it was on the}} right flank while Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's division was in the center and Guieu's division was on the left flank. On 19 March Bernadotte attacked Gradisca d'Isonzo and was repulsed. After Sérurier's division swung around the south side of Gradisca and gained the <b>heights</b> <b>in</b> the rear of the town, the garrison surrendered. The French captured four battalions of Austrian infantry totaling 2,500 soldiers, 10 guns and eight colors. While Bernadotte continued advancing to the east, Guieu's division followed by Sérurier turned north in pursuit of a column under Adam Bajalics von Bajahaza. At this time Sérurier fell ill and command of his division passed to Louis François Jean Chabot. Trapped between Massena and Guieu, Bajalics was forced to surrender with 4,000 men in the Battle of Tarvis. After recovering, Sérurier resumed command of his division at Graz on 20 April and after the Treaty of Leoben the unit withdrew from Austria and took position at Sacile.|$|E
5|$|From Ozone Park, {{he moved}} to Manhattan, where a counter-cultural {{community}} had built up around the Greenwich Village and the Lower East Side that contained an array of gay people, hippies, occultists and others adopting bohemian lifestyles. Without money, he resorted to working as a rent boy, and made use of both marijuana and LSD. Although he briefly returned to Catholicism, in 1971 he read a copy of Witchcraft Today (1954), a book authored by Englishman Gerald Gardner, the founder of Gardnerian Wicca, and it reignited his interest in Pagan religion. In the autumn, he tracked down Leo Martello (1931–2000), a prominent gay rights activist and Pagan Witch who practiced his own Italian-focused form of the Craft known as the Strega tradition. Although he felt that Buczynski was too inexperienced in magic to begin practicing Strega Craft, Martello befriended and shared his contacts with the young man, and took him {{with him on a}} visit to Herman Slater (1935–1992), a fellow New Yorker who was of Jewish heritage. Like Buczynski and Martello, Slater was gay, and a romantic relationship soon developed between Buczynski – who was attracted to bears – and the older man. Buczynski moved in with Slater to an apartment in the Brooklyn <b>Heights</b> <b>in</b> June 1972.|$|E
