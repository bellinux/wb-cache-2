Furthermore, recent advances in gene transfer technologies in transgenic mice have enabled the functional dissection of <b>gene</b> <b>effects</b> mapping to complex, repeated parts of the genome, such as the Lgn 1 locus, causing susceptibility to Legionella pneumophila in macrophages.

However, {{little is known about}} their pattern of inheritance due to lack of advanced statistical genetic model-fitting techniques despite the existence of advanced statistical packages. Objectives: The aim of the present study is to determine the mode of inheritance of dermatoglyphic traits through complex segregation analysis. Subjects and Methods: Finger and palmar prints of 325 individuals belonging to 104 families from the Chuvashian popu-lation of Russia were used for principal component analysis, familial correlation, and segregation analysis (package MAN- 5). Results: The results suggest a common internal structure of three factors when compared with other populations.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that genetic factors control blood pressure level at all ages. However, the evidence is limited because of the composite nature of blood pressure and the heterogeneity of the studied samples. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to test for genetic influences on systolic blood pressure (SBP) level in a community-based Israeli family study. Segregation analysis was performed on 622 adults from 208 pedigrees. Age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) were significant covariates of SBP. Segregation analysis rejected the environmental transmission model but not the mixed Mendelian transmission model. The bestfitting genetic model was the mixed codominant model, with a heritability of 0. 32 and an allele frequency of 0. 18 for high SBP level. We further tested whether SBP and BMI shared a common major <b>gene</b> <b>effect.</b> Using bivariate segregation analysis involving two traits and a single locus, we found evidence for a single-locus pleiotropic effect on SBP and BMI. The allele frequency of this major locus was 0. 24.

In the following year, parents and their progenies were grown in a randomized complete block design with three replications, and 10 traits were measured. The analysis of variance showed significant differences (p≤ 0. 01) between cultivars. Furthermore, general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) for parents and hybrids were significant. Therefore, additive and non-additive <b>gene</b> <b>effects</b> on controlling traits were demonstrated. According to the analysis based on the second and fourth Griffing methods, additive <b>gene</b> <b>effects</b> were more than non-additive <b>gene</b> <b>effects</b> on controlling growth period, plant height, panicle length, number of panicles/plant and brown rice length, while other studied traits were more controlled by non-additive <b>gene</b> <b>effects.</b> Comparison of the second and fourth Griffing methods showed that the proportions of additive and non-additive variances in two methods were different. Moreover, GCA and SCA resulting from the two methods for several traits such as vegetative and productive growth period, plant height, number of filled grains/panicle and grain yield were significant. Therefore, it could be concluded that using parental generations in the second Griffing method may cause biased estimate of the GCA and SCA variances.

(F 1 xP 2)) were raised and subjected to generation mean analysis for detecting the nature of <b>gene</b> <b>effects</b> responsible for inheritance of the number of grains, grainweight and single grain weight per spike of the longest culm. Results: Digenic epistatic model was adequate to explain variation in generationmeans for single grain weight in Divana/Srpanjka and for grain weight per spike of the longest culm in Soissons/Žitarka crossing combinations. Additive <b>gene</b> <b>effects</b> were more important for grain weight per spike of the longest culm in Soissons/Žitarka cross, while dominance and epistatic <b>gene</b> <b>effects</b> were predominant in controlling inheritance of single grain weight in Divana/Srpanjka cross. For the number of grains in both crosses, single grain weight in Soissons/Žitarka and grain weight per spike in Divana/Srpanjka crossing combinations, digenic epistatic model failed to explain variation in generation means. Conclusions: These data suggest that in crosses where digenic epistatic model was adequate with predominant positive influence of additive <b>gene</b> <b>effects</b> accompanied with high narrow-sense heritability, it is possible to expect advance for traits studied in further segregation generations. Crosses where digenic epistatic model were insufficient to explain all variation in generation means along with low heritability imply more complex nature of inheritance and/or influence of the environment on the expression of these traits...|$|R
