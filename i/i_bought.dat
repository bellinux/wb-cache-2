25|$|According {{to early}} Muslim historians, towns that {{surrendered}} without resistance and made treaties with the Muslims {{were allowed to}} retain their churches and the towns captured by Muslims had many of their churches converted to mosques.

In 1978, {{in an effort}} to produce Monty Python's Life of Brian, they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films.
