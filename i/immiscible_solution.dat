When driven at triple phase boundary electrode systems, electron and ion transfer {{occur in the}} same interfacial reaction zone. In this report, preliminary work with a novel electrode system based on two coupled triple phase boundary reaction zones is described. An inter-digitated gold band array with 7 μm gold bands separated by 13 μm gaps is employed immersed in aqueous electrolyte with a water <b>immiscible</b> <b>solution</b> of the redox system N,N-diethyl-N’N’-didodecyl-phenylenediamne (DDPD) in 4 -(3 -phenylpropyl) -pyridine (PPP) immobilised on the surface.

In practice, this means that a selective extraction process is required to remove all the unwanted cellular material {{in a manner that}} minimizes degradation of the RNA by hydrolysis or ribonuclease activity. The method described here relies on cell homogenization in an aqueous medium containing a strong detergent (sodium tri-isopropylnaphthalene sulfonate) and a chelating agent (sodium 4 -aminosalicylate) to solubilize the cell components. An <b>immiscible</b> <b>solution</b> of phenol is then added to selectively extract hydophobic components and to denature protein. Following phase separation, the RNA is recovered by precipitation from the aqueous phase by the addition of absolute alcohol, thereby separating the RNA from small molecular weight contaminants such as carbohydrates, amino acids, and nucleotides...|$|E

The combinations provide the exact colors of various plants {{at different stages}} of development. The Robinsons found that, at different ratios of anthocyanins to copigments, the copigments had different effects and they postulated that this was due to the copigments breaking up the anthocyanin complexes, which they observed when they were in solution together. They studied these pigments by comparing color distributions in <b>immiscible</b> <b>solutions</b> after reactions with alkalis or ferric chloride.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe spinodal {{decomposition}} and {{the nucleation process}} were in-situ {{observed in}} two <b>immiscible</b> <b>solutions,</b> H 2 O- 7 wt%PVME and H 2 O- 3 wt%PVME, {{and the influence of}} their different kinetics effects on the phase separation was examined. It was found that to form the same size minority phase droplets, the time in the nucleation process was 3 ∼ 4 times longer than that in spinodal decomposition. Moreover, since the phase separation was controlled by spinodal decomposition near the critical composition and there was the largest immiscible temperature interval, the phase migration of the minority phase had enough time. In addition, the Marangoni migration velocity was measured in H 2 O- 3 wt%PVME solution, which agrees well with the theoretical values, suggesting that the Marangoni convection plays a key role during phase separation...|$|R

Asbestos was precoated with a well-adhered film of nylon 6, 6, a polymer especially compatible with the epoxy phase. The proposed pretreatment procedure involves serial application to the asbestos of two <b>immiscible</b> <b>solutions</b> of hexamethylenediamine and adipoyl chloride, or impregnation in nylon 6, 6 solution.

Previous work conducted in our laboratory on chrysotile/epoxy composites coated with Nylon 6, 6 provided interesting results when the tensile performance was evaluated.

In this study emphasis is given to the coating of long carbon fibres such as are used for the preparation of unidirectional carbon/epoxy composites.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{in the past few years}} that the {{interface}} formed between two <b>immiscible</b> <b>solutions</b> of electrolytes can be treated, from an electrochemical point of view, in the same manner as the Solution/electrode interface, and essen-tially the same techniques of electrochemical investigation can be used. A review of the methods pertaining to biologi-cally important materials is given. Specifically, the following groups of experiments are treated: direct transport mea, surement of certain ionic species (choline, acetylcholine, and dodecylsulfate), transport of probe ions across the adsorbed material (lecithin and several proteins), impedance measurements in the presence of adsorbed bovine serum albumin, and transport across the interface facilitated by antibiotics (valinomycin and monensin). Investigations of the electrochemical properties of in-terfaces between two immiscible so]utions containing dis-solved electrolytes have attracted an increasing number of scientists in the past years.

50|$|Standard column {{chromatography}} {{consists of a}} solid stationary phase and a liquid mobile phase, while gas chromatography (GC) uses a solid or liquid stationary phase on a solid support and a gaseous mobile phase. By contrast, in liquid-liquid chromatography, both the mobile and stationary phases are liquid. The contrast is, however not as stark as it first appears. In reversed-phase chromatography, for example, the stationary phase {{can be regarded as}} a liquid which is immobilized by chemical bonding to a micro-porous silica solid support. In countercurrent chromatography centrifugal or gravitational forces immobilize the stationary liquid layer. By eliminating solid supports, permanent adsorption of the analyte onto the column is avoided, and a high recovery of the analyte can be achieved. The countercurrent chromatography instrument is easily switched between normal phase chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography simply by changing the mobile and stationary phases. With {{column chromatography}}, the separation potential is limited by the commercially available stationary phase media and its particular characteristics. Nearly any pair of <b>immiscible</b> <b>solutions</b> can be used in countercurrent chromatography provided that the stationary phase can be successfully retained.|$|R

40|$|A {{microencapsulation}} and electrostatic processing (MEP) {{device is}} provided for forming microcapsules. In one embodiment, the device comprises a chamber having a filter which separates a first {{region in the}} chamber from a second region in the chamber. An aqueous solution is introduced into the first region through an inlet port, and a hydrocarbon/ polymer solution is introduced into the second region through another inlet port. The filter acts to stabilize the interface and suppress mixing between the two <b>immiscible</b> <b>solutions</b> as they are being introduced into their respective regions. After the solutions have been introduced and have become quiescent, the interface is gently separated from the filter. At this point, spontaneous formation of microcapsules at the interface may begin to occur, or some fluid motion may be provided to induce microcapsule formation. In any case, the fluid shear force at the interface is limited to less than 100 dynes/sq cm. This low-shear approach to microcapsule formation yields microcapsules with good sphericity and desirable size distribution. The MEP device is also capable of downstream processing of microcapsules, including rinsing, re-suspension in tertiary fluids, electrostatic deposition of ancillary coatings, and free-fluid electrophoretic separation of charged microcapsules...|$|R
30|$|<b>Immiscible</b> <b>solutions</b> {{are often}} used to form the fluid {{interface}} since such an interface can provide a defect-free junction that has an importance for the products with high purity[6]. Many one-dimensional (1 D) nanowires and nanotubes and 2 D nanosheets and nanocombs of metals, metal oxide, metal sulfide, and complexes have been designed and constructed in the past decades[7 – 9]. Our previous work has revealed that the specific features of the metal ions (such as the geometry) and coordination numbers of the anionic ions or ligands take {{an important role in}} governing the crystal structure of the products[10 – 12], though a complex interplay of van der Waals, electrostatic, magnetic, molecular, and entropic effects needs to be considered. Besides the inorganic compounds, polymer crystalline nanomaterials could also be constructed at the liquid/liquid interfaces. For instance, Matsui and coworkers synthesized single crystalline conducting polymer, poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene), with the fast conductance switching property[13]. They further prepared single crystalline nanoneedles of polyaniline and polypyrrole via an interfacial polymerization induced by FeCl 3 [14]; the products have a fast conductance switching time between the insulating and conducting states in the order of milliseconds.|$|R

40|$|Petroleum {{activities}} have been frequently associated to environmental damage due to occurrence of {{oil spill in}} worldwide sea waters. In addition to this problem it must be considered that many non-petrol companies process oil derivatives and discharge their rejection in rivers, accidentally or purposely. The monitoring of water contamination is usually carried out by government agencies, {{as well as by}} private committees. Therefore, population rarely becomes totally aware of the facts concerning oil contamination in rivers and seas, unless these committees and agencies publish accurate data about it. Social participation is an important demand as to promoting politically correct environmental management, however it is necessary to provide instrumental support to achieve this aim. In this work it is proposed a “do it yourself” viscometer designed to estimate oil rate in bodies of water contaminated by ship spill or industry discharge.
