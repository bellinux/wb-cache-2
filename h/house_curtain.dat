50|$|The {{auditorium}} has {{a traditional}} Italian horseshoe shape and can seat 1,979. The stage {{is the largest}} in Europe and can accommodate as many as 450 artists. The canvas <b>house</b> <b>curtain</b> was painted to represent a draped curtain, complete with tassels and braid.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>house</b> <b>curtains,</b> which vary in construction, operation, and cost. Depending on a curtain's type, its fabric may be flat or pleated, and it may drape, hang, or do both. Some types open by rising into the fly space above the stage; other types travel horizontally, or travel {{vertically}} but gather near the proscenium top and thus do not require a fly space. Some require mechanical power to operate whereas others may be operated by a person, by pulling an operating line (a rope) or directly pulling the curtains.|$|R

50|$|The apron {{is an area}} {{of stage}} that extends beyond the <b>house</b> <b>curtain</b> and is visible to the audience. The apron at Grimsby Auditorium {{measures}} 22 metres in width and 2.5 metres in depth. Extensions can also be constructed to extend the stage further into the Auditorium, a technique employed to create a thrust style stage or a catwalk for fashion shows.|$|E
50|$|The {{stage is}} the actual {{performance}} area of a theatre. Including the apron, the Grimsby Auditorium stage measures a total depth of 11m, with a measurement of 8.5 metres from {{the line of the}} <b>house</b> <b>curtain</b> to the cyclorama or back wall. The width of the stage depends {{on the size of the}} production being staged as the curtains which form the proscenium and wings are flexible, meaning the stage can be made to appear wider or narrower.|$|E

The passage that follows practically brims with enchanting musings as to what might actually be going on behind the <b>house’s</b> <b>curtains,</b> deep in the shadows beyond its latticework, a narrative technique that is largely unused up until this point in the novel—one that’s tapped only when the readers are finally given the opportunity to glance briefly into Kaname’s world of fantasy.|$|R

5000|$|In the U.S., {{the musical}} previewed {{beginning}} in Los Angeles with Edwin Lester's L.A (and San Francisco) Civic Light Opera Association, as a 1962 national tour. The Sean Kenny sets were duplicated. The sets built in London were shipped by sea and {{delivered to the}} Port of San Pedro, with the actual stage brick wall London mural painted as a scenic backing. Sean Kenny's design concept eliminated a <b>house</b> <b>curtain,</b> exposing the turntable stage set, the open lighting pipes rigged with lamp fixtures, electric cables, and an open loft to the arriving audience. The turntable, scenic set and elements duplicated the original garish stylistic [...] "wood grained" [...] painted finish. With lighting, the set was intended to take on each specific color mood and change atmosphere. Edwin Lester hated the set's paint job, [...] ordering his scenic shop manager Phil Raiguel to send scenic artists to glaze down the red, green, blue, yellow, orange grain finish. During the companies rehearsal prior to that evenings' 8 pm premiere audience, the two scenic artists (Wally Reid and Hub Braden) glazed over the scenery while the cast rehearsed on the turntable stair platform and bridge units. [...] The scenic artists continued painting/glazing while the cast took their meal break prior to the overture. As the audience was seated, the open-to-view stage set painting continued, with the two scenic artists still painting and glazing as the musical was performed; continuing during the intermission, through the second act performance, and taking curtain calls with the company. [...] Remaining on stage afterwards, the two continued their glazing throughout the night, finishing the set's repainting the following day at noon. [...] Reviews noted that the stage direction included [...] "two London house painters" [...] atmosphere performance, later questioning where and why the house painters had been eliminated after the show's opening night [...]|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate mortality and performance, darkling beetle population (Alphitobius diaperinus), light intensity, electrical energy consumption and economic efficiency of broilers reared under two lighting programs (nearly continuous or intermittent) and two curtain colors (yellow or blue). The experiment was conducted between June, 2004 and May, 2005. Six flocks were sequentially housed in four 12 &# 215; 10 m broiler houses divided into 4 pens with 200 birds each. Litter was reused six times or until flock 6. Body weight and feed conversion were determined on days 21, 35, and 42 of each flock. Mortality was recorded daily. Electrical energy consumption was recorded at the end of the grow-out of each flock (every 42 days). A completely randomized design in a 6 &# 215; 2 &# 215; 2 factorial arrangement (flocks, lighting programs, curtains) with four replicates per treatment was applied. Broilers reared in <b>houses</b> with yellow <b>curtains</b> and under nearly continuous lighting programs presented the best feed conversion ratio and the highest body weight. Nearly continuous lighting programs resulted in 1. 48 times more sudden deaths and 1. 34 times higher general mortality when compared with intermittent lighting programs. Electrical energy consumption was 2. 12 times higher in nearly continuous lighting programs in relation to intermittent lighting programs. The presence of darkling beetles was higher in broiler <b>houses</b> with blue <b>curtains</b> and intermittent lighting program. The economic analysis showed the feasibility of using a mixed system, with intermittent light program in winter and spring and nearly continuous lighting program in the summer and autumn, both in broiler <b>houses</b> with yellow <b>curtains...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{determined}} {{the efficacy of}} the use of permethrin-impregnated uniforms for prevention of malaria and leishmaniasis in a double-blind, randomized study of Colombian soldiers on patrol. In the study of malaria, soldiers were issued impregnated uniforms (i. e., a shirt, an undershirt, pants, socks, and a hat) or uniforms washed in water; the soldiers wore the uniforms day and night for a mean of 4. 2 weeks and were observed for an additional 4 weeks. Three (3 %) of 86 soldiers wearing impregnated uniforms contracted malaria, whereas 12 (14 %) of 86 soldiers wearing control uniforms contracted malaria (P =. 015). In the study of leishmaniasis (soldiers were in the area of endemicity for 6. 6 weeks and were observed for 12 weeks thereafter), 4 (3 %) of 143 soldiers wearing impregnated uniforms and 18 (12 %) of 143 soldiers wearing control uniforms acquired disease (P =. 002). In the leishmaniasis study, and presumably in the malaria study, breakthrough infections in the treated group were primarily due to bites in unclothed regions of the body (face and hands). Permethrin-treated uniforms were virtually nontoxic (there were only two cases of mild skin irritation among 229 subjects), and impregnation is quick and inexpensive. Impregnation of clothing with permethrin is suggested for nonimmune populations who are likely to be exposed to malaria or leishmaniasis over a period of 1 - 2 months. Protection against arthropod-borne diseases such as malaria and leishmaniasis theoretically could be accomplished by elim-ination ofthe arthropod vector or by administering immunopro-phylaxis or chemoprophylaxis to the host, but these fundamen-tal approaches presently lack efficacy and are associated with side effects and high cost. An alternative approach is creation of a barrier between the insect vector and the host. For sedentary populations, treatment of <b>house</b> <b>curtains</b> or bed nets with the insecticide permethrin has been effective against malaria i...|$|R

50|$|During the 1960s and 70s, Abraham's {{interest}} in the typology of the house inspired masterful, visually compelling, imaginative architectural drawings, accompanied by evocative titles and texts, such as Earth-Cloud House, project (1970), The <b>House</b> with <b>Curtains</b> Project, Perspective (1972), The House Without Rooms, project, elevation and plan (1974), and The Cosmology of The House (1974), to explore human dwellings, the ritual of habitation, and the subjectivity of spatial conditions, especially interiority. Abraham's shadowy visions, such as Radar Cities, Terza Mostra d' Architettura, (1985), and Metropolitan Core (2010) propose thoughtful architectural prototypes. Glacier City (1964) is an invisible city, between walls, {{on either side of}} a wide valley.
