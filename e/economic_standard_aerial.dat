40|$|A {{software}} solution is presented that {{allows users to}} automatically or semi-automatically register their aerial video imagery to controlled reference imagery and generate geographically accurate, orthorectified video mosaics. Video provides a cost-efficient data source for many remote-sensing applications where <b>standard</b> <b>aerial</b> photography is cost prohibitive. Video provides an inexpensive, easily obtained, compact sensor that can be carried aloft easily, controlled by novice users and even carried on small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Exploitation of video imagery has been hampered by the small Field of View (FOV) of video cameras and the generally manual processes required for using video {{as if it were}} <b>standard</b> <b>aerial</b> imagery. The Rigorous Aerial Video Exploitation eNvironment (RAVEN) is a software tool for accurately geolocating and geo-rectifying aerial video. RAVEN was developed to allow a user to photogrammetrically tie an aerial video sequence to a reference image using automated processing. RAVEN was developed by Observera, Inc., a leader in the application of advanced imagery exploitation techniques, in conjunction with ImageLinks, Inc., the premier provider of quick response geometrically corrected imagery products. RAVEN provides the ability to very accurately register a sequence of video frames to a controlle...|$|R
40|$|In {{region with}} rapid growing {{economic}} and population, such as Klaten Regency, Central Java, Indonesia, availability of cadastral infrastructure plays {{important role in}} land management. It is also useful to anticipate conflict due to parcel ownership and parcel usage in future. Commonly, in Indonesia, production of cadastral and parcel data utilizes terrestrial mapping or <b>standard</b> <b>aerial</b> photogrammetric mapping. Terrestrial mapping using Total Station has exellent accuracy, but it is expensive and time consuming. <b>Standard</b> <b>aerial</b> photogrammetric mapping is suitable for moderate area and has good accuracy, but it needs expensive equipment, for instance: aerial metric camera. For limited area coverage, about 1. 000 hectare, Small Format Aerial Photogrammetry (SFAPm) has advantage in low cost equipment and its operational, efficient, and rapid photo acquisition. This technology is efficient since it utilizes amateur digital camera or non metric digital camera equipped on ultra light aeroplane. This non metric digital camera is widely available on market. This paper elaborates utilization of low cost SFAPm for cadastral mapping in Klaten Regency, Central Java, Indonesia. The study {{was carried out in}} 7 stages, i. e. developing Ground Control Points (GCP), aerial photography survey, interior orientation for each photo...|$|R
40|$|Measuring {{differences}} in the <b>economic</b> <b>standard</b> of living of between natives and other ethnic groups can inform us about the relative disadvantages and inequalities within Italian society. Despite {{the importance of this}} question, the measurement of this gap is not an easy task because, when using the usual design-based approach to survey sampling inference, the available micro-data lack sufficient sample size for the majority of immi- grant communities needed to obtain reliable estimates. In this paper, we show that small area estimation (SAE) techniques can be applied in a fruitful way to avoid this issue. In particular, we use an approach based on M-quantile regression for estimating the <b>economic</b> <b>standard</b> of living in each community in Italy. Our findings highlight economic disparities between natives and other ethnic groups and suggest the need to adopt specific policies that target the most vulnerable immigrant communities and are designed to improve their <b>economic</b> <b>standard</b> of living...|$|R

40|$|The direct {{geo-referencing}} {{of sensors}} {{based on a}} combination of relative kinematic GPS-positioning and inertial measurement units (IMU) has reached a high accuracy level and growing application. It includes the advantage of a very flexible use, independent upon control points which are only required for the system calibration and independent upon block or strip configurations. It is in use in areas with difficult access, as well as for standard applications. The direct georeferencing is a prerequisite for the economic use of small format digital images instead of <b>standard</b> <b>aerial</b> photos. Projects with standard accuracy requirements can be handled without problems. Only some limitations may appear for the model setup; disturbing y-parallaxes cannot be avoided with the today dominating application of <b>standard</b> photographic <b>aerial</b> cameras. But an improvement of individual models or a whole block by a combined adjustment together with image coordinates of tie points can solve this problem. For large scale projects with higher accuracy requirements an integrated sensor orientation by a bundle block adjustment with the orientations as observations and a minimal number of control points is proposed. An overview of the status of direct and integrated sensor orientation will be given. 1...|$|R
