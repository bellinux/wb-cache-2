Part II will trace {{the historical development of}} the assignment of income doctrine and will analyze the doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s underlying rationale. The importance of distinguishing between gratuitous and nongratuitous assignments of income will be developed in this Part. Part III will present a number of hypothetical situations drawn from actual cases and rulings that involve the {{application of the}} doctrine to personal service income. This will both show the pervasiveness of the doctrine and lay the basis for further analysis. Part IV will demonstrate that the tests currently used by the Internal Revenue Service and the courts in these situations—the “similarity” test and the “agency” test—fail to provide either a rational or workable basis for solving these problems. Instead, they have resulted in a welter of unintelligible and <b>irreconcilable</b> <b>decisions.</b> Finally, Part V will show how reference to the doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s underlying purpose, and particularly to the basic distinction between gratuitous and nongratuitous assignments of income, solves many of the puzzles besetting the application of the doctrine...|$|E
40|$|Statelessness clearly implicates issues {{concerning}} basic human rights. The United Nations has addressed {{some of these}} issues by taking steps to reduce statelessness and to minimize its results, most notably with the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and the Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons. Although mitigating the effects of statelessness is noble and quite worthwhile, these efforts may fail to reach certain stateless persons, and, more specifically, certain stateless entities. Enter Matimak Trading Company (2 ̆ 2 Matimak 2 ̆ 2), a corporation formed under the laws of, and with its principal place of business in, Hong Kong. Recently, the U. S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals deemed Matimak to be 2 ̆ 2 stateless 2 ̆ 2 due to Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s status as a dependent territory and Great Britain 2 ̆ 7 s nationality law. The court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction since Matimak failed to meet one of the criteria set out in the Alienage Diversity statute, being a citizen of a foreign state. Matimak Trading Co. v. Khalily deviates from the opinions reached by other circuits when confronted with the citizenship issue of corporations formed under the laws of British Dependent Territories. Wilson v. Humphreys (Cayman) Ltd. best illustrates this departure In Wilson, the Seventh Circuit held that a Cayman Islands corporation, although incorporated under the laws of a British Dependent Territory, was a citizen of a 2 ̆ 2 foreign state 2 ̆ 2 under the Alien Diversity statute. It therefore could access United States federal courts. These <b>irreconcilable</b> <b>decisions</b> leave similarly situated corporations in a jurisdictional twilight zone where their ability to enter a federal courthouse is questionable. This inconsistent treatment of foreign corporations by the courts of appeals could have international ramifications. A remedy imposing certainty is crucial. This article investigates methods to alleviate this intercircuit conflict...|$|E
40|$|The Brussels I Regulation ((EU) No 1215 / 2010) {{governs the}} {{division}} of jurisdiction between the Member States of the European Union and provides for the circulation of judgments within the Member States in civil and commercial matters. Arbitration is excluded from {{the scope of the}} Regulation, and the Regulation should not affect the application of the New York Convention in the Member States. The arbitration exclusion reflects a traditional understanding that the systems of international civil procedure and international arbitration are expected to function autonomously. Despite this, the two systems occasionally collide as parties to a dispute attempt to initiate parallel court and arbitral proceedings. Further, if parallel court and arbitral proceedings on the same matter and between the same parties cannot be prevented, they may result in two at least partially overlapping and conflicting decisions. This study concerns first whether parallel court and arbitral proceedings can be prevented in ways that are compatible with the Regulation and the New York Convention. The second research question concerns on which grounds a Member State court is able to refuse recognition and enforcement of a Brussels I regime judgment that conflicts with an arbitral award. The study is based on doctrinal research, and the objectives of the study are twofold. First, the study examines the prevailing interpretation of the Regulation’s interface with arbitration and secondly, the study aims at presenting a recommendation regarding the application of the Regulation in case a Member State court is requested to enforce a judgment conflicting with an arbitral award. Regarding the first research question, the study examines the availability of measures restricting or discouraging parallel court and arbitral proceedings. The prohibition of court-ordered anti-suit injunctions established in the case-law of the CJEU under the old Brussels I Regulation ((EC) No 44 / 2001) remains applicable under the recast Regulation. Further, the assessment of whether Member State courts are permitted to order damages for breach of arbitration agreement appears to give a negative answer as such damages are argued to be contrary to the principle of mutual trust between Member State courts. On the contrary, the recognition and enforcement of anti-suit injunctions ordered by arbitrators and arbitral awards ordering damages for breach of arbitration agreement appear to be outside the scope of the Regulation but national laws of the Member States strongly limit the availability and enforceability of such measures. This leads to a conclusion that parallel court and arbitral proceedings cannot be effectively prevented under the Regulation. As a main rule, the decision which is rendered first is to be recognised and enforced in other Member States on the application of a party regardless of any pending parallel proceedings. The Regulation particularly prescribes that it shall not affect the application of the New York Convention, which has led to a discussion concerning the possibility of anti-enforcement injunctions directed against the enforcement of a judgment that has been rendered prior to an arbitral award on the same matter and between the same parties. Such injunctions appear, however, both incompatible with the Regulation and unnecessary with regard to the unaffected application of the New York Convention. If a Brussels I regime judgment has been given first, it can be enforced in accordance with the Regulation. The same applies to an arbitral award under the New York Convention if the recognition and enforcement of the award is sought first. The Regulation does not address on which grounds a Member State court may refuse the enforcement of a Brussels I regime judgment in case the enforcement is requested only after a conflicting arbitral award is recognised and enforced in the Member State addressed. It appears clear that the enforcement must be refused in such situation but, on the other hand, the grounds for refusal of recognition and enforcement of a Brussels I regime judgment are exhaustively listed in the Regulation. The study discusses four alternative grounds for refusing the enforcement. It is concluded that the enforcement of a conflicting Brussels I regime judgment should be refused on the grounds of being contrary to the public policy in the Member State addressed since the national public policy cannot accommodate recognition and enforcement of two <b>irreconcilable</b> <b>decisions...</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{historical}} indications concerning {{each chapter}} are often {{far from being}} exact, even since they were corrected in the Roman edition of 1582. It may be regretted that St. Raymond did not have recourse to the original documents themselves, of which a large number must have been at his disposal. The summaries (summaria) that precede the chapters are {{the work of the}} canonists, and may assist in the elucidation of the text. The partes decisae are sometimes of like use, but never when these parts were designedly omitted from a desire to extinguish their legal force or because they contain <b>decisions</b> <b>irreconcilable</b> with the actual text of the law.|$|R
40|$|The Supreme Court {{decision}} in Maher v. Roe, denying an equal protection claim to Medicaid payments for elective abortions, illustrates the Court 2 ̆ 7 s inconsistent application of minimal rationality standards to socioeconomic legislation. This comment analyzes Maher {{in light of}} recent <b>irreconcilable</b> Supreme Court <b>decisions</b> involving similar equal protection claims to welfare payments. It shows that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s standard of review vacillates between deferential abdication to the legislature and unexplained judicial interventionism, and concludes that until the Court adheres to a consistent and principled approach to minimal rationality review, equal protection will remain an area for unrestrained imposition of judicial, rather than constitutional, values. The alternative offered is an articulated rationality test that would limit the Court to reviewing state-articulated, rather than Court-hypothesized, objectives...|$|R
