5|$|There was {{speculation}} during September {{and early}} October 2007 about whether Brown {{would call a}} snap general election. Indeed, the party launched the Not Flash, Just Gordon advertising campaign, which was seen largely as pre-election promotion of Brown as Prime Minister. However, Brown announced on 6 October {{that there would be}} no election any time soon – despite opinion polls showing that he was capable of winning an election should <b>he</b> <b>call</b> one. This proved to be a costly mistake, as during 2008 his party slid behind the Conservatives (led by David Cameron) in the polls. Disputes over political donations, a string of losses in local elections, and by-election losses in Crewe and Glasgow did himself and the government no favours either.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 17, while {{going through}} {{insurance}} papers in his parents' home, Rose learned of his biological father's existence, and he unofficially readopted his birth name. However, he referred to himself only as W. Rose, {{because he did not}} want to share a first name with his biological father. Following the discovery of his true family origins, Rose became the local juvenile delinquent in Lafayette; he was arrested more than 20 times on charges such as public intoxication and battery, and served jail terms up to three months. After Lafayette authorities threatened to charge him as a habitual criminal, Rose moved to Los Angeles, California, in December 1982. After moving to Los Angeles, he became so engrossed in his band AXL that his friends suggested <b>he</b> <b>call</b> himself Axl Rose; he legally changed his name to W. Axl Rose prior to signing his contract with Geffen Records in March 1986.|$|E

Bayliss donated his damages to UCL for use in research; according to Mason, Bayliss ignored the Daily Mails suggestion that <b>he</b> <b>call</b> it the [...] "Stephen Coleridge Vivisection Fund". Gratzer wrote in 2004 that the fund may still have been in use then to buy animals.|$|E
500|$|The paratroopers {{headed down}} the main {{thoroughfare}} of Saigon towards Independence Palace. At first, the forces encircled the compound without attacking, believing that Diệm would comply with their demands. Đông attempted to call on US ambassador Elbridge Durbrow {{to put pressure on}} Diệm. Durbrow, although a persistent critic of Diệm, maintained his government's position of supporting Diệm, stating [...] "We support this government until it fails". Durbrow later recalled receiving a telephone call from an aide to Diệm who insisted that <b>he</b> <b>call</b> Diệm and tell him to surrender or face a howitzer attack on the palace. [...] Durbrow refused and no attack took place. [...] He consequently learned that the aide was forced to make the call.|$|E
500|$|A {{monument}} in the composer's memory featuring a weeping Muse was erected in the Victoria Embankment Gardens in London and is inscribed with Gilbert's words from The Yeomen of the Guard: [...] "Is life a boon? If so, it must befall that Death, whene'er <b>he</b> <b>call,</b> must call too soon". Sullivan {{wished to be}} buried in Brompton Cemetery with his parents and brother, but by order of the Queen he was buried in St. Paul's Cathedral. In addition to his knighthood, honours awarded to Sullivan in his lifetime included Doctor in Music, honoris causa, by the universities of Cambridge (1876) and Oxford (1879); Chevalier, Légion d'honneur, France (1878); The Order of the Medjidieh conferred by the Sultan of Turkey (1888); and appointment as a Member of the Fourth Class of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) in 1897.|$|E

500|$|By 1956, the Zappa {{family had}} moved to Lancaster, a small {{aerospace}} and farming town in the Antelope Valley of the Mojave Desert close to Edwards Air Force Base; he would later refer to Lancaster in the 1973 track [...] "Village of the Sun". Zappa's mother encouraged him in his musical interests. Although she disliked Varèse's music, she was indulgent enough to give her son a long distance call to the composer as a 15th birthday present. Unfortunately, Varèse was in Europe at the time, so Zappa spoke to the composer's wife and she suggested <b>he</b> <b>call</b> back later. In a letter Varèse thanked him for his interest, and told him about a composition {{he was working on}} called [...] "Déserts". Living in the desert town of Lancaster, Zappa found this very exciting. Varèse invited him to visit if he ever came to New York. The meeting never took place (Varèse died in 1965), but Zappa framed the letter and kept it on display {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, Faldo's {{partnership}} with David Leadbetter {{came to an}} acrimonious end when Faldo dispensed with his services by post in a letter. The two men have reportedly not spoken since. In 2003, Leadbetter said of Faldo: [...] "He wasn't the most popular guy with all the players, that's for sure. He didn't go out to win friends and influence people. Very seldom does <b>he</b> <b>call</b> people by name. He {{was very difficult to}} get close to. But I don't think it hurt his performance. You don't have to be 'Mr Popular' to win golf tournaments." ...|$|E

In March 1965, DeShannon recorded Burt Bacharach and Hal David's [...] "What the World Needs Now Is Love", which led to club tours and regular appearances on television and went to No. 7 on the US charts and No. 1 in Canada. (DeShannon's recording of the song was subsequently used in the 1969 film Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice.) She appeared in the 1967 film C'mon, Let's Live a Little, with Bobby Vee, as a folk singer.|$|E
