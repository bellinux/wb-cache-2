Hardie, {{who was in a}} bookmakers {{at the time of the}} call, suggests that Bulloch and Paul Savage continue mixing the song, and says he will try to contact Braithwaite.

5|$|In 2005, Rovers ran an April Fools' <b>joke</b> <b>on</b> their {{official}} website, {{stating that the}} team's new away strip would be all pink. Although this {{was intended to be}} a joke, a number of fans petitioned the club to get the kit made for real, and also suggested that funds raised through the sale of the pink shirts should be donated to a breast cancer charity. Although the pink shirts were never used in a competitive fixture, they were worn for a pre-season friendly against Plymouth Argyle in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Eiland-Hall, a 34-year-old {{computer}} science student in Panama City, Florida, saw the discussion on Fark using the Gottfried <b>joke</b> <b>on</b> Beck {{and created a}} website, GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com, intending it as a parody of Beck's style of political commentary. He chose not {{to identify with the}} WHOIS service and decided to remain anonymous. Eiland-Hall used the domain name registrar Namecheap for his site. It was launched on September 1, 2009, and received over 120,000 page views during its first 24 hours. The website asserted that it did not believe the charges were true. Eiland-Hall wrote on the site that those furthering the meme were asserting Beck used a similar strategy to promote his opinions and increase his viewership.|$|E

5|$|He was {{a friend}} of Queen guitarist and {{astrophysicist}} Brian May, who was an occasional guest on The Sky at Night. May bought Moore's Selsey home in 2008, leasing it back to him for a peppercorn rent the same day to provide financial security. May, Moore and Chris Lintott co-wrote a book Bang! The Complete History of the Universe. In February 2011, Moore completed (with Robin Rees and Iain Nicolson) his comprehensive Patrick Moore's Data Book of Astronomy for Cambridge University Press. In 1986 he was identified as the co-author of a book published in 1954 called Flying Saucer from Mars, attributed to Cedric Allingham, which was intended as a money-making venture and practical <b>joke</b> <b>on</b> UFO believers; Moore never admitted his involvement. He once joined the Flat Earth Society as an ironic joke.|$|E

25|$|In 1961, Kindelán was ennobled as a Marqués, {{although}} the gesture was {{interpreted as an}} ironic <b>joke</b> <b>on</b> the part of Franco, mocking the fact that, despite all his efforts, Kindelán was still not living in the monarchy that he so desired. He died the following year with Spain still under Franco.|$|E
25|$|Awdry also {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} illustrations, usually as a <b>joke</b> <b>on</b> the part of the illustrator. In one illustration by John T.

25|$|At {{one point}} in the episode, Leela is crying and takes a tissue to dry her eye. However, when she does this, she tears the tissue in half. While this {{can be seen as a}} <b>joke</b> <b>on</b> Leela being a cyclops, the audio {{commentary}} reveals that this was actually an in-joke among the writers. Around the time of production, Cohen became sick, but still came to work anyway. To save tissues, he ripped a tissue in half.|$|E
25|$|Someone {{has played}} a reprehensible <b>joke</b> <b>on</b> a grieving mother. The photo in {{question}} {{is not one of}} her son but of three boys in Tampa, Florida about 1979–80, challenging each other to an escape contest. There was an investigation concerning that picture, made by the Hillsborough County (FL) Sheriff's Office. No charges were filed, and no wrongdoing was established. The lead detective on the case was named Zalva. This allegation should be easy enough to check out.|$|E
25|$|Beebe was {{a staunch}} {{supporter}} of the Revolution. One night he organized a public meeting at his house {{to talk about the}} Revolution. While he was addressing the people, gunfire was heard and fires were seen in the distance as if the British were coming. Beebe suspected this was a trick. So, he sent a small party by a back road to check it out and to cut off the retreat of this scouting party. They captured the culprits, {{who turned out to be}} young men from the town who had burned some cornstalks and were playing a <b>joke</b> <b>on</b> the people at the meeting to test their patriotism.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} 1951 it was {{generally}} accepted at King's that the B form of DNA was a helix, but after she had recorded an asymmetrical image in May 1952, Franklin became unconvinced that the A form of DNA was a helix. In July 1952, as a practical <b>joke</b> <b>on</b> Wilkins (who frequently expressed his view that both forms of DNA were helical), Franklin and Gosling produced a funeral notice regretting the 'death' of helical crystalline DNA (A-DNA). During 1952, they worked at applying the Patterson function to the X-ray pictures of DNA they had produced. This was a long and labour-intensive approach but would yield significant insight into {{the structure of the}} molecule.|$|E

25|$|The Rangers and Angels rivalry {{has been}} said to develop over a {{domination}} in the division between the two teams, and also in recent years more animosity between the two teams due {{to the amount of}} former players from each team playing for the division rival. Players such as Mike Napoli, Darren Oliver, Vladimir Guerrero, C. J. Wilson, and Josh Hamilton have all been acquisitions the two division rivals have made from one another. In 2012, Wilson played a <b>joke</b> <b>on</b> Napoli, his former teammate, by tweeting his phone number, causing Napoli to exchange words with Wilson. The feuds go back to two incidents between Angels second baseman Adam Kennedy and Rangers catcher Gerald Laird which led to punches being thrown.|$|E
