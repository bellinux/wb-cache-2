To this end, a methodology has been developed, which initially defines the number of spectral thresholds (which determines the number of frequency sub-bands that are created) from 0 to 12, with 0 meaning that the overall frequency spectrum of the EEG is considered as a single <b>frequency</b> <b>sub-band</b> and all other values (1 – 12) defining the number of frequency sub-bands (i.e. for five spectral thresholds, six frequency sub-bands are created). Then, all possible combinations of these sub-bands are created, subject to simple limitations (i.e. the range of each sub-band is forced to be ≥[*] 2 [*]Hz). From each combination, a set of features is extracted, which are used in a classifier. The Bonn EEG database has been employed and results are obtained in terms of classification accuracy, indicating the importance of this study. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first systematic analysis of the impact of different <b>frequency</b> <b>sub-band</b> number and range, presented in the literature.

In the pen-position, high <b>frequency</b> <b>sub-band</b> signals are considered as individual features {{to enhance the}} difference between a genuine signature and its forgery. On the other hand, low <b>frequency</b> <b>sub-band</b> signals are utilized as features for suppressing the intra-class variation in the pen-movement angle. Verification is achieved by the adaptive signal processing using the extracted features.
