5|$|By {{the age of}} 22, Evans {{moved out}} of wheel-making and became a {{specialist}} in forming the <b>fine</b> <b>wire</b> used in textile cards, which were used to comb fibers {{in preparation for the}} spinning process to make thread or yarn. A desire to increase the efficiency of this process led him to his first invention—a machine which would bend wire into teeth and cut them off rapidly to aid the assembly of cards. George Latimer, then a justice of the peace in Newport, saw its potential and tasked a blacksmith with creating the machine, which became one of Evans's early successes when it was introduced in 1778. Evans wished to go further in mechanizing the production of textile cards by developing a machine which could puncture the leather into which the wire teeth were inserted. His invention greatly speeded the card manufacturing process, producing around 1,500 teeth every minute, though Evans himself was unable to find financial backing to commercialize his invention. Nevertheless, {{over the next two decades}} card manufacturing innovations inspired by Evans's led to the development of automated textile card production, then in great demand due to the growth of the Southern cotton industry. Early pioneers of mechanized textile-card production, including Giles Richards and Amos Whittemore, are thought to have borrowed heavily from his original designs.|$|E
25|$|The classic {{experiment}} {{to measure the}} strength of a gravitational source (i.e. its active mass) was first conducted in 1797 by Henry Cavendish (Fig.5‑9a). Two small but dense balls are suspended on a <b>fine</b> <b>wire,</b> making a torsion balance. Bringing two large test masses close to the balls introduces a detectable torque. Given the dimensions of the apparatus and the measurable spring constant of the torsion wire, the gravitational constant G can be determined.|$|E

25|$|Drawing dies are {{typically}} made of tool steel, tungsten carbide, or diamond, with tungsten carbide and manufactured diamond {{being the most}} common. For drawing very <b>fine</b> <b>wire</b> a single crystal diamond die is used. For hot drawing, cast-steel dies are used. For steel wire drawing, a tungsten carbide die is used. The dies are placed in a steel casing, which backs the die and allow for easy die changes. Die angles usually range from 6–15°, and each die has at least 2 different angles: the entering angle and approach angle.|$|E
25|$|Increasing gauge numbers denote {{decreasing}} wire diameters, {{which is}} similar to many other non-metric gauging systems such as British Standard Wire Gauge (SWG), but unlike IEC 60228, the metric wire-size standard used {{in most parts of the}} world. This gauge system originated in the number of drawing operations used to produce a given gauge of wire. Very <b>fine</b> <b>wire</b> (for example, 30gauge) required more passes through the drawing dies than 0gauge wire did. Manufacturers of wire formerly had proprietary wire gauge systems; the development of standardized wire gauges rationalized selection of wire for a particular purpose.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} the hook shank can vary widely from merely {{straight}} {{to all sorts of}} curves, kinks, bends and offsets. These different shapes contribute in some cases to better hook penetration, fly imitations or bait holding ability. Many hooks intended to hold dead or artificial baits have sliced shanks which create barbs for better baiting holding ability. Jig hooks are designed to have lead weight molded onto the hook shank. Hook descriptions may also include shank length as standard, extra long, 2XL, short, etc. and wire size such as <b>fine</b> <b>wire,</b> extra heavy, 2X heavy, etc.|$|E

25|$|To avoid {{electrical}} interference with her sensitive hydrographic surveying equipment, Explorer′s deck machinery and major auxiliary equipment all {{was driven by}} high-pressure steam. When commissioned, Explorer was considered to have the finest and most extensive hydrographic surveying equipment {{in the history of}} the Coast and Geodetic Survey′s fleet, all entirely electrically powered. The equipment included a fathometer, a Dorsey sonic depth finder, a Hughes automatic depth recorder system, a special taut-wire measuring gear with 120 nautical miles (138 statute miles; 222km) of <b>fine</b> <b>wire</b> and several tons of iron balls, and hydrophones. Electrolysis eliminators mounted to her hull ensured that she would be grounded so as to avoid interference with her electrical surveying equipment.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, {{pioneering}} accelerator physicists Merle Tuve and Gregory Breit built a 5 million volt Tesla coil as {{a linear}} particle accelerator. The bipolar coil {{consisted of a}} pyrex tube a meter long wound with 8000 turns of <b>fine</b> <b>wire,</b> with round corona caps on each end, and a 5 turn spiral primary coil surrounding it at the center. It was operated in a tank of insulating oil pressurized to 500 psi which allowed it to reach a potential of 5.2 megavolts. Although it was used {{for a short period}} in 1929-30 it was not a success because the particles' acceleration had to be completed within the brief period of a half cycle of the RF voltage.|$|E
25|$|This {{primitive}} telephone {{was rapidly}} improved. The double electromagnet {{was replaced by}} a single permanently magnetized bar magnet having a small coil or bobbin of <b>fine</b> <b>wire</b> surrounding one pole, in front of which a thin disc of iron was fixed in a circular mouthpiece. The disc served as a combined diaphragm and armature. On speaking into the mouthpiece, the iron diaphragm vibrated with the voice in the magnetic field of the bar-magnet pole, and thereby caused undulatory currents in the coil. These currents, after traveling through the wire to the distant receiver, were received in an identical apparatus. This design was patented by Bell on January 30, 1877. The sounds were weak and could only be heard when the ear was close to the earphone/mouthpiece, but they were distinct.|$|E
40|$|Tensile {{experiments}} on cold-drawn Ni microwires with diameters from similar to 115 to 50 gm revealed high strengths, with significant strength variability for <b>finer</b> <b>wires</b> with diameters less than similar to 50 gm. The wires showed pronounced necking at fracture. The coarser wires with diameters > 50 mu m exhibited conventional ductile cup-cone fracture, with dimples {{in the central}} zone and peripheral shear lips, whereas <b>finer</b> <b>wires</b> failed by shear with knife or chisel-edge fractures. Shear bands were observed in all samples. Further, through- section microscopy of selected fractured samples revealed that the shear bands did not go across the enitre specimen for the coarser wires. The shear bands led to grain fragmention, with a reduction in grain aspect ratio as well as rotations away from the initial orientations. The strength data were analysed based on a Weibull approach. The data could be rationalized in terms of failure from volume defects in coarser wires, with a high Weibull modulus, and from surface defects in <b>finer</b> <b>wires,</b> with a low Weibull modulus and greater variability.

5000|$|One {{apocryphal}} {{story about}} the HCF instruction in an actual early CPU {{goes back to the}} late 1960s, when computers used magnetic core memory. The story goes that in order to speed up the core memory on their next model the engineers increased the read/write currents in the very <b>fine</b> <b>wires</b> that were threaded through the cores. This worked fine when the computer was executing normal programs, since memory accesses were spread throughout memory. However, the HALT instruction was implemented as a [...] "Jump to self". This meant that the same core memory location was repeatedly accessed, and the very <b>fine</b> <b>wires</b> became so hot that they started to smoke—hence the instruction was labeled [...] "Halt and Catch Fire".|$|R
25|$|Soap pellets are {{combined}} with fragrances {{and other materials}} and blended to homogeneity in an amalgamator (mixer). The mass is then discharged from the mixer into a refiner, which, {{by means of an}} auger, forces the soap through a <b>fine</b> <b>wire</b> screen. From the refiner, the soap passes over a roller mill (French milling or hard milling) {{in a manner similar to}} calendering paper or plastic or to making chocolate liquor. The soap is then passed through one or more additional refiners to further plasticize the soap mass. Immediately before extrusion, the mass is passed through a vacuum chamber to remove any trapped air. It is then extruded into a long log or blank, cut to convenient lengths, passed through a metal detector, and then stamped into shape in refrigerated tools. The pressed bars are packaged in many ways.|$|E
25|$|The {{specialized}} transformer {{used in the}} Tesla coil circuit, {{called a}} resonant transformer, oscillation transformer or radio-frequency (RF) transformer, functions differently from an ordinary transformer used in AC power circuits. While an ordinary transformer is designed to transfer energy efficiently from primary to secondary winding, the resonant transformer is also designed to temporarily store electrical energy. Each winding has a capacitance across it and functions as an LC circuit (resonant circuit, tuned circuit), storing oscillating electrical energy, analogously to a tuning fork. The primary coil (L1) consisting of a relatively few turns of heavy copper wire or tubing, is connected to a capacitor (C1) through the spark gap (SG). The secondary coil (L2) consists of many turns (hundreds to thousands) of <b>fine</b> <b>wire</b> on a hollow cylindrical form inside the primary. The secondary is not connected to an actual capacitor, but it also functions as an LC circuit, the inductance of (L2) resonates with stray capacitance (C2), {{the sum of the}} stray parasitic capacitance between the windings of the coil, and the capacitance of the toroidal metal electrode attached to the high voltage terminal. The primary and secondary circuits are tuned so they resonate at the same frequency, they have the same resonant frequency. This allows them to exchange energy, so the oscillating current alternates {{back and forth between the}} primary and secondary coils.|$|E
500|$|Briarcliff Farms {{intended}} {{to prove that}} optimal farming practices could be profitable. Law believed that kind treatment would produce better cattle, and was intolerant of animal abuse: [...] "Cruelty to a cow {{is the same as}} cruelty to me, and shall never be permitted on this farm." [...] He knew everyone who lived at the farms, and the farm workers knew the name of each cow (which was on a brass plate {{at the front of the}} cow's stall). The cows were sponged several times a day, and workers wore white cotton suits which were sterilized daily by boiling. Law treated his workers as intelligent co-workers, rather than laborers. Each cow was groomed before milking, and a pail of warm water and a brush would then be used on her sides, flanks and udders. The flank and udder were washed again with a one-percent creolin solution, rinsed and dried. Workers would milk into a <b>fine</b> <b>wire</b> strainer placed over a pail; during milking no talking, laughing, smoking or spitting was permitted, since such behavior was claimed to have a [...] "perceptible effect upon their milk". The workers were required to wash their hands thoroughly after cleaning the udders and before milking each cow. Each worker had a set of towels and washed, cared for and milked 15 or 16 cows. The cattle grazed from early spring until late autumn, and were in the barns only for milking. In 1901, The Trained Nurse and Hospital Review said it doubted that any other large New York-area dairy did this.|$|E

The coiled-coil filament evaporates more slowly than a straight filament of the same surface area and light-emitting power. As a result, the filament can then run hotter, which results in a more efficient light source, while reducing the evaporation so that the filament will last longer than a straight filament at the same temperature.|$|E
