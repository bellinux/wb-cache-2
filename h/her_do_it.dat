500|$|Following the character's {{diagnosis}} with bipolar disorder, her switching Summer's {{paternity test}} was heavily criticized by critics, {{who felt that}} the character still had not been repaired. About.com listed the paternity twist {{as one of the}} worst storylines of 2013 on the soap opera. Mental health advocate Arthur Gallant of The Huffington Post commended the show's initial portrayal of Sharon's bipolar disorder, writing: [...] "I praise the writers for their diligence in how mental illness has been depicted and feel the show has done their part in helping to eliminate mental health stigma." [...] Sara Bibel of Xfinity slammed Josh Griffith's writing, stating that he [...] "undid all his great work rehabilitating the character of Sharon" [...] in a [...] "character-destroying" [...] storyline. Garrett (writing for Highlight Hollywood this time) was livid with then-executive producer Jill Farren Phelps, who he labeled as a female misogynist, and strongly opposed to Sharon being turned into a villain [...] "with no good reason". Soap Opera Digest named the character of Sharon as the [...] "Most Ruined" [...] soap opera character in both 2012 and 2013, while in turn praising the performance of Case. In December 2014, Daytime Confidential described Sharon {{as one of the most}} [...] "drastically damaged" [...] characters in the history of the soap opera genre, and wrote, [...] "You name it, one head writer or another has had <b>her</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Kleptomania. Three baby daddies. Bipolar disorder. It was almost like a reward was passed out in the Y writing room anytime anyone came up with something more awful to have Sharon do." [...] Giddens criticized Charles Pratt Jr. in 2015 for enjoying writing Sharon as [...] "crazy", [...] "despite legions of fans demanding the bipolar character be given back her dignity". Writing for TV Insider, Michael Logan said in 2016 that fans of the character were tired of seeing her written as [...] "the liar, the villain, the nutcase, the doormat".|$|E
2500|$|Satana then starred as [...] "Varla" [...] in the 1965 film Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!â€”a very {{aggressive}} and sexual female character {{for which she}} did all of her own stunts and fight scenes. Renowned film critic Richard Corliss called her performance [...] "the most honest, maybe the one honest portrayal in the Meyer canon and certainly the scariest". Originally titled The Leather Girls, the film is an ode to female violence, based on a concept created by Russ Meyer and screenwriter Jack Moran. Both felt at her first audition that Satana was [...] "definitely Varla." [...] The film was shot on location in the desert outside Los Angeles during days when the weather was more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit and freezing nights, with Satana clashing regularly with teenage co-star Susan Bernard due to Bernard's mother's reportedly disruptive behavior on the set. Meyer said Satana was [...] "extremely capable. She knew how to handle herself. Don't fuck with her! And {{if you have to}} fuck <b>her,</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> well! She might turn on you!" ...|$|E

50|$|Lusty {{was talking}} to {{herself in the mirror}} when the other girls were fighting. Promo caught <b>her</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> and was creeped out.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am er man,' said Mr Dolls, {{trying to}} smite {{himself on the}} breast, but {{bringing}} his hand to bear upon the vicinity of his eye, <b>'er</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> I am er man er do it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] I judged after all, [...] "that {{only makes}} <b>her</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> the more honourable. She'll {{go through with}} it, {{whatever}} it costs, rather than disappoint him after he has waited so long. It's true," [...] I continued, [...] "that when a woman acts {{from a sense of}} honour--!" ...|$|R
60|$|According to Helen's {{judgment}} Bo {{might have}} been a Western girl all her days. But Dale shook his head and made <b>her</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> over.|$|E
6000|$|... "You wouldn't {{believe about}} Aggie, John. Perhaps you will now!" [...] said Miss Elizabeth. [...] "I saw <b>her</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and she's cut her throat too!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} that I saw <b>her</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> She stabbed him twice with a knife. She first helped me to rob him, and then she murdered him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{you have}} to <b>do</b> is think <b>it</b> over. <b>Do</b> {{you think you can}} make those greyhounds extend {{themselves}} with the promise of a bite of meat? It's the whip that makes them extend.--Look over there at Billy Green. There ain't another way to teach that dog that trick. You can't love <b>her</b> into <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> You can't pay <b>her</b> to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> There's only one way, and that's make her." ...|$|R
60|$|I hesitated, perplexed whether I should pursue <b>her.</b> What <b>did</b> <b>it</b> all mean? Then I {{heard some}} one upstairs.|$|R
60|$|LEVINS. Your Worship, I'd {{no chance}} to stop <b>'er,</b> she <b>did</b> <b>it</b> when I was out lookin' for work.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{a shameful}} thing to do," [...] Tommy agreed, shaking his head. [...] "But she did it!" [...] he added triumphantly; [...] "you saw <b>her</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> Elspeth!" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} {{contradictory}} for one in mademoiselle's state of agreeable jocularity to foam at the mouth, otherwise a tigerish expansion thereabouts might {{look as if}} a very little more would make <b>her</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I forgot!" [...] she moaned. [...] "Tommy, you are angry!" [...] She hugged him, {{and he let}} <b>her</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> but all {{the time}} he was looking over her head fixedly, with his mouth open.|$|E
50|$|Also, she was {{supposed}} to go to Miss Universe 2003 pageant, but her Miss Europe title didn't allow <b>her</b> to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|Here was {{a family}} of strangers {{stranded}} in a dull season in London, {{and there was no}} manner of obligation upon her to exert herself to show them attention. Her state of health would have been an all-sufficient reason why she should not <b>do</b> it; and <b>her</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> was simply a specimen of that unselfish care for others, even down to the least detail, of which her life was full.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{waste your}} pity, Miss Florence. Ruth reads a {{newspaper}} {{better than any}} woman I ever knew. I've heard <b>her</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> to the old man, getting through shipping news, money-market, and politics in fine style. I wouldn't offer her money if I were you, {{though it is a}} kind thought. These people have an honest pride in earning things for themselves, and I respect them for it," [...] added Mr. Wallace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Romancing! Why, she cannot conceal her venom. She taunted me {{this morning}} in the summer-house because Marmaduke has never made me a formal proposal. It was the letter that made <b>her</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Ask Marian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis {{wonderful}} {{that she should}} ask ye," [...] observed the magisterial coachman, presently. [...] "I have never known <b>her</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> before, for as a rule she takes {{no interest in the}} village folk at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{know what}} she thinks of me yet, but I do know very well what she's got to think of me. She's got to think all the world of me--if I break every limb of my body making <b>her</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|Judith {{would not}} speak to her at breakfast, and this almost broke Salome's heart; but she dared not yield. After breakfast, she limped painfully into her room, and still more painfully dressed herself. When she was ready, she took a little old worn Bible out of her box. It had been her mother's, and Salome read a chapter in it every night, {{although}} she never dared to let Judith see <b>her</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
50|$|In truth, she battled {{the phantom}} because Tara's ghost asked <b>her</b> to <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> {{even though it}} would lower her status in the coven. Willow seeks infallible magic.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I {{thought you}} meant {{they must have}} told <b>her</b> they'd <b>do</b> <b>it</b> off their own bat, without getting her into a row with Philip. Was I right?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{advice to}} you is this. If you mean to marry <b>her,</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> at once. If you and she {{together}} can't manage the old man, you can't be worth your salt. If you can do that, then you can throw Jones overboard." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Locker put {{his hands}} in his pockets. [...] "Do you know," [...] said he, [...] "as this thing had to be done, I prefer to have you do it than to have <b>her</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Well, it is done now! And so am I!" ...|$|E
60|$|Yes, but she needn't marry them. If {{she wants}} to {{encourage}} Basil let <b>her</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> from a discreet distance. Genius always thrives best on bread and water and platonic attachments. If Hilda marries him he'll only become fat and ugly and bald-headed and stupid.|$|E
6000|$|... "It doesn't {{matter at}} all what one says, Baas, because she reads {{thoughts}} before they pass the lips. I felt <b>her</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> there in that room. And do you be careful, Baas, or she will eat up your spirit and make {{you fall in love}} with her, who, I expect, is very ugly indeed, since otherwise she would not wear a veil. Whoever saw a pretty woman tie up her head in a sack, Baas?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take what {{we could}} find here!" [...] It was so unlike him--he who had always been so strong in {{preserving}} their little domestic refinements in their rude surroundings, that their poverty had never seemed mean, nor their seclusion ignoble. She turned away to conceal her indignant color. She could share the household work with a squaw and Chinaman, she could fetch wood and water. Catlin had patronizingly seen <b>her</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it,</b> but to dance to his vulgar piping--never! ...|$|R
25|$|Miss Elizabeth {{disappeared}} from WWF television until WrestleMania VII, when Savage lost a retirement match to The Ultimate Warrior. Upon his loss, Sherri began beating and kicking the defeated Savage until Elizabeth, {{who was sitting}} at ringside, entered the ring and defended Savage. Elizabeth grabbed Sherri by the hair and threw {{her out of the}} ring, reuniting Savage and Elizabeth. Macho Man punctuated the reunion by holding down the ropes for Elizabeth after years of <b>her</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> for him.|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} in the attitude of her whole figure as he supported it, and she hung her head, which besought him to be merciful and not force her to disclose her heart. He was not merciful with her, and he made <b>her</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{went into}} the wrong shop, fust, last Thursday,' said Riderhood. 'Found myself among the young ladies, by George! Over the young ladies, I see a Missis. That Missis is sweet enough upon you, Master, to sell herself up, slap, {{to get you out}} of trouble. Make <b>her</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> then.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can nothing {{be done to}} get her back?" [...] {{cried the}} father. [...] "There must be some way to save <b>her.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>it</b> von Horn, and not only is my {{daughter}} yours but my wealth as well--every thing that I possess shall be yours if you will but save her from those frightful creatures." ...|$|E
60|$|And yet {{all this}} seemed so {{difficult}} to believe--and besides, if the girl came in <b>her</b> sleep, <b>did</b> <b>it</b> not prove <b>her</b> love quite as conclusively? It might be unconscious, but it was there.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear boy, I know it, but I can't give it. I {{thirst for}} information. What do I mean? If my taking {{so much trouble}} to recover <b>her</b> <b>does</b> not mean that I care for <b>her,</b> what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> mean? [...] "If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled pepper, where's the peck," [...] &c.?' ...|$|R
60|$|Alma {{would have}} given much if she could only have induced Anna to answer Gilbert's letter, but coaxing Anna to do {{anything}} was a very sure and effective way of preventing <b>her</b> from <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
