But it was such an amazing thing for me to come in to make this broken-down picture, and to find my director was the great Roscoe Arbuckle.

It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.|$|E

25|$|A {{great effort}} {{would have been}} needed by the England batsmen {{to put them in}} a {{position}} beyond defeat, and Milton and Bailey went to the wicket with a load on their shoulders. Benaud at once set a very aggressive field, especially to Bailey, where he fielded only three yards from the bat to Meckiff's bowling, a little deeper for Davidson. Bailey had a word with Benaud, no doubt asking him not to move when the bowler was running up to bowl. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was so close that if Bailey had put his bat out to swing at a ball he would have hit him.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the young}} Kashgari women were most {{attractive}} in appearance, {{and some of the}} little girls quite lovely, their plaits of long hair falling from under a jaunty little embroidered cap, their big dark eyes, flashing teeth and piquant olive faces reminding me of Italian or Spanish children. One most beautiful boy stands out in my memory. He was clad in a new shirt and trousers of flowered pink, his crimson velvet cap embroidered with gold, and as he smiled and salaamed to us <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> looked like a fairy prince. The women wear their hair in two or five plaits much thickened and lengthened by the addition of yak's hair, but the children in several tiny plaits.|$|E

25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

[...] As a senior, Larkins played against Gordon Bell, Archie Griffin, and Ricky Bell of USC. [...] Larkins said: [...] "Gordon Bell was the best of the three. [...] He was a super tough runner and a tough guy to make a solid tackle on. [...] Gordon has a lot more speed and more moves than Archie does, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was a better all around player." ...|$|E

500|$|Carter said of {{the casting}} of Nick Chinlund as Pfaster, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} wonderfully creepy villain. The casting of that show was very difficult. We saw many actors, but there was a quality I was looking for and I couldn't put a name on that quality. I finally figured out what it was when Nick came in and he had a kind of {{androgynous}} quality that worked. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> looked like Joe College, but he could scare the hell out of you." [...] Producer Glen Morgan said Chinlund's performance was outstanding. Nutter stated [...] "Nick Chinlund was wonderful to work with. The guy was like putty in my hands. He was great. If you're looking for someone to underline the weirdness and strangeness of the character, he did that." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{is based}} on a 19th-century Russian folktale, which Joe Ranft {{introduced}} to Burton while they were finishing The Nightmare Before Christmas. The film began production in November 2003, while Burton was completing Big Fish. He continued with production on his next live-action feature, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which was produced simultaneously with the film. Co-director Mike Johnson spoke about how they took a more organic approach to directing the film, saying: [...] "In a co-directing situation, one director usually handles one sequence while the other handles another. Our approach was more organic. Tim knew where he wanted the film to go as far as the emotional tone and story points to hit. My job was to work with the crew on a daily basis and get the footage {{as close as possible to}} how <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> wanted it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{screenplay}} {{was written}} by Alun Owen, who was chosen because the Beatles were familiar with his play No Trams to Lime Street, and he had shown an aptitude for Liverpudlian dialogue. McCartney commented, [...] "Alun hung around with us and was careful to try and put words in our mouths that he might've heard us speak, so <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> {{did a very good}} script." [...] Owen spent several days with the group, who told him their lives were like [...] "a train and a room and a car and a room and a room and a room"; the character of Paul's grandfather refers to this in the dialogue. Owen wrote the script from the viewpoint that the Beatles had become prisoners of their own fame, their schedule of performances and studio work having become punishing.|$|E

500|$|While {{working at}} Rádio Nacional in 1939, he met Brazilian vocalist Adelaide Tostes, who {{is better known}} by her stage name Stella Maris, and the two married in 1940. Tostes responded to a 1994 press query about Caymmi's habit of frequenting bars with a short story: [...] "One night I went to look for him in a bar ... He was {{surrounded}} by women. I went in and slammed a table. A glass broke. The bouncer came, and I punched Caymmi's face. Then I left cussing. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was involved with drugs, but it wasn't the case. He was with the tramps." [...] Despite such incidents, however, they remained together for 68 years, {{until his death in}} 2008. The couple had three children, Nana, Danilo, and Dori, all of whom followed their father into musical careers.|$|E

[...] Morrison recorded the song [...] "Brown Eyed Girl" [...] in New York with Berns, as well as the album Astral Weeks. He became much more popular with the album Moondance, and Rolling Stone commented he had [...] "the striking imagination of a consciousness that is visionary in the strongest sense of the word". Morrison's image appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone a year after releasing Moondance.|$|E
