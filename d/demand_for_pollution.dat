40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of uncertainty, {{in the form of}} {{measurement}} error, in pollution regulation under a tradable permit system. In particular, we showed the neutrality between the penalty and the audit frequency does not hold when agents (firms) are risk averse. Firms respond to the weight change between penalty and monitoring effort by adjusting their <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>pollution</b> permits, as well as their production/pollution decisions. We studied two forms of the measurement error when observing the emissions: additive and multiplicative. While there are some analytical results for a model with additive error, the same cannot be said when the error is multiplicative to the real emission. We then used numerical methods to simulate firms behavior and the industry equilibrium with multiplicative error, and to identify the best policy for the government...|$|E
40|$|Firms {{are often}} {{protected}} by limited liability, which holds them financially liable for an environmental damage only upon their net value. Limited liability {{may explain the}} under-investment in prevention by firms and the small <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>pollution</b> insurance. To counterbalance this tendency, the American Congress adopted a harsh environmental legislation in 1980 which extends the (financial) liability to any operator of the pollutant firm, and especially to banks. In the Directive on environmental liability proposed by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, financial guarantees rather than extended liability are the important point. In this article, we study both liability systems {{in the light of}} the results of the economic theory on the impact of extended liability on the behaviors of firms, banks and insurers.

40|$|It {{is often}} claimed that {{pollution}} reductions {{can be achieved}} at lower cost in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, because more possibilities exist to update production processes and reduce waste. To date, however, {{there has been little}} or no systematic evaluation of what the costs actually are in these countries. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to partially fill this research gap using firm-level data from Lithuania. Abatement cost estimates for key air pollutants are presented based on investments made in Lithuania during 1993 - 94. The paper also attempts to estimate the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>pollution</b> directly using data on pollution charges from 1994. Lithuania offers a relatively unique opportunity to conduct such an analysis, because the system of pollution charges sets different rates for different polluters emitting the same pollutant. Using both methods it is shown that for at least some key pollutants marginal and average abatement costs are probably substantially lower in Lithuania than in western countries...|$|E
40|$|Air {{quality has}} {{deteriorated}} in Hong Kong {{over more than}} 15 yr. As part of a program of public accountability, photographs on Poor and Better visibility days were used as representations of the relationships among visibility, air pollution, adverse health effects, and community costs for health care and lost productivity. Coefficients from time-series models and gazetted costs were used to estimate the health and economic impacts of different levels of pollution. In this population of 6. 9 million, air quality improvement from the annual average to the lowest pollutant levels of Better visibility days, comparable to the World Health Organization air quality guidelines, would avoid 1335 deaths, 60, 587 hospital bed days, and 6. 7 million doctor visits for respiratory complaints each year. Direct costs and productivity losses avoided would be over US 240 million a year. The dissemination of these findings led to increased <b>demands</b> <b>for</b> <b>pollution</b> controls from the public and legislators, but denials {{of the need for}} urgent action arose from the government. The outcome demonstrates the need for more effective translation of the scientific evidence base into risk communication and public policy...|$|R
40|$|Firms that {{generate}} negative externalities may consider {{the effects of}} their location on the surrounding environment because {{of the right of}} their prospective neighbors to <b>demand</b> compensation <b>for</b> <b>pollution</b> and raise the transaction costs of location. Since communities vary both in the value individuals place on the environment and in the ability of residents to organize politically, locations {{that generate}} the least political opposition may not be the locations that result in the lowest externalities. This article tests whether the degree to which firms internalize their externalities depends on the ability of affected communities to engage in collective action. The results indicate that firms processing hazardous waste, when deciding where to expand capacity, do take into account variations in the potential for collective action to raise their costs. ...|$|R

Some large energy corporations which are among the greatest generators of fossil-fuel-related pollution may purchase carbon credits, which can encourage farmers to engage in conservation tillage.

40|$|Environmental {{pollution}} {{liability insurance}} was officially introduced in China only in 2006, {{as part of}} new market-based approaches for managing environmental risks. By 2012, trial applications of pollution insurance had been launched in 14 provinces and cities. More than ten insurance companies have entered the pollution insurance market with their own products and contracts. Companies in environmentally sensitive sectors and high-risk industries bought pollution insurance, and a few successful compensation cases have been reported. Still, pollution insurance faces a number of challenges in China. The absence of a national law weakens the legal basis of pollution insurance, and poor technical support stagnates further implementation. Moreover, current pollution insurance products have limited risk coverage, high premium rates, and low loss ratios, which make them fairly unattractive to polluters. Meanwhile, low awareness of environmental and social liabilities leads to limited <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>pollution</b> insurance products by industrial companies. Hence, the pollution insurance market is not yet flourishing in China. To improve this situation, this economic instrument needs stronger backing by the Chinese state...|$|E

40|$|The <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> air <b>pollution</b> {{abatement}} {{used the}} median voter model as its theoretical basis. A utility function for the median voter was devised with air pollution abatement {{as one of}} the goods. This utility function also incorporated transpolitical boundary costs and benefits. Implicit prices were derived from the expenditure identity: price times quantity equals expenditures. Data on air pollution abatement and expenditures <b>for</b> air <b>pollution</b> abatement by state governments and two-digit SIC manufacturing industries were used. Only point source manufacturing air pollutants were considered. The utility function was maximized subject to a budget constraint, and ordinary demand functions were derived;Air pollution abatement was hypothesized to be a public good produced by a figurative joint firm of the state governments and private emitting industries. This figurative joint firm was assumed to minimize the cost of abatement. A marginal cost function for abatement was derived by minimizing costs subject to an output constraint. Competitive behavior was assumed for the figurative joint firm with price set equal to marginal cost;The exogenous variables on the demand side included gross personal income, attitudes about environmental quality in the previous year, stock of air pollution in the previous year and a measure of the skewness of the distribution of income. The exogenous variables in the marginal cost equation include wages of state government workers enforcing air pollution regulations, wages of private industry air pollution abatement workers, the user cost of capital and the stock of air pollution in the previous year;Econometric estimates of the demand and marginal cost equations were derived using two-stage least squares. The data were pooled time-series and cross-section observations of the fifty states of the United States for the period 1974 - 1978;Significant findings include low elasticity of <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> air <b>pollution</b> abatement with respect to price (- 0. 17) and with respect to income (0. 44). Also of note is the elasticity of demand with respect to income distribution skewness (1. 56) leading to the inference that those who are decisive in determining the level of air pollution abatement benefit through cost shifting from skewed income distributions...|$|R

40|$|Policy In {{the last}} 30 to 40 years, an {{increasing}} {{awareness of the}} link between urban air pollutant levels and negative health effects have led to numerous studies and policies that are targeted towards both understanding the linkage and mitigating its effects. In 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) created the Clean Air Act directed at reducing harmful emissions that cause high pollution levels in urban areas. Ever since then, environmental economists and policy makers have attempted to better understand the economic impacts of these regulations through cost and benefit analysis. Towards that end, we have developed a methodology for fully integrating the health effects from exposure to air pollution into a computable general equilibrium economic model. This model represents the first attempt at fully incorporating the economic valuation of air pollution in an integrated economic model that has endogenously built-in consumer demand and preference curves to accurately represent the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> air <b>pollution</b> health. This framework provides a way to consistently valu...|$|R

50|$|The biggest {{obstacle}} to the widespread adoption of WQT markets is lack of supply and demand. In fact, studies of current water quality trading programs indicate that the typical problems associated with inhibition of water quality trading, such as high transaction costs, poor institutional infrastructure, and uncertain criteria, are being overcome. The main problem is that, under existing regulatory conditions, there are simply not enough willing buyers and sellers. Currently, most nonpoint sources of water pollution are unregulated or, assuming detection occurs, have relatively small consequences for violations. Consequently, nonpoint sources do not have incentive to participate in WQT. For WQT markets to be successful, greater <b>demand</b> is needed <b>for</b> <b>pollution</b> credits. <b>For</b> this to happen, water quality standards need to be clear and enforceable.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{increase}} in environmental concern {{has led to a}} <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> more effective <b>pollution</b> control strategies that would satisfy the new EPA standards regarding automotive emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx). In particular, the removal of NOx from lean-burn and diesel engines operating under an oxygen-rich atmosphere presents a significant challenge as conventional three-way catalysts are ineffective in this environment. Moreover, the presence of water vapor and sulfur oxides (SOx) in the exhaust stream both inhibits catalyst activity and results in long-term catalyst instability. Thus, it is necessary to develop novel technologies for the removal of NOx from the exhaust of lean-bum engines. This thesis examined three metal oxide nanocomposite systems to serve as (i) catalysts for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx by propene, (ii) sorbents for SO 2 storage, and (iii) catalysts for NOx storage-reduction (NSR). In 203 -Ga 203 /A 1203 nanocomposite catalysts have been synthesized using th...|$|R

40|$|More than 2 {{billion people}} rely on solid fuels and {{traditional}} stoves or open fires for cooking, lighting, and/or heating. Exposure to emissions caused by burning these fuels {{is believed to}} be responsible for a significant share of the global burden of disease. To achieve widespread health improvements, interventions that reduce exposures to indoor air pollution will need to be adopted and consistently used by large numbers of households in the developing world. Given that such interventions remain to be adopted by large numbers of these households, much remains to be learned about household <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> interventions designed (in part at least) to reduce indoor air pollution. A general household framework is developed that identifies in detail the determinants of household <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> indoor air <b>pollution</b> interventions, where <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> an intervention is expressed in terms of willingness to pay. Household demand is shown to be a combination of three terms: (1) the direct consumption effect; (2) the child health effect; and (3) the adult health effect. While micro-level data are not available to estimate directly this model, existing data and information are used to estimate just the health effects component of household demand. Based on such existing information, it might be concluded that household demand should seemingly be strong given that willingness to pay, based on existing information, is seemingly large compared to costs for common interventions like improved stoves. Given that household demand is not strong for existing interventions, this analysis shows that more clearly focused research on household <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> interventions is needed if such interventions are going to be demanded (i. e. adopted and used) by large numbers of households throughout the developing world. Four priority areas for future research are: (1) improving information on dose-response relationships between indoor air pollution and various health effects (e. g. increased mortality and morbidity risks); (2) improving information on impacts from interventions in terms of air pollution reductions and also cooking times, fuel use, and heat intensities; (3) improving information on household shadow values for improved health, with separate information for adult and child health; and (4) considering more directly household information, and its adequacy, for their ability to evaluate the relationships between fuel use and health.
