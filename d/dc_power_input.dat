40|$|The DC-AC converter, {{also known}} as inverter, {{converts}} DC power to AC power at desired output voltage and frequency.

40|$|A simple {{model of}} the efficiency-power {{relationship}} for a microwave transmitter permits comparison of M-ary amplitude and phase shift keyed (MAPSK) signal array performance {{on the basis of}} average <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> in, rather than average RF signal power out. This is of interest in comparing MAPSK arrays with comparable polyphase, since the polyphase transmitter is operated at a single power level, while MAPSK varies over a range of power levels, each of differing efficiency. A constant efficiency-power curve permits comparison of signal arrays in terms of array average power, while a linear curve requires comparison on the basis of array peak power. Since typical efficiency curves will lie between these extremes, the array peak and average power levels provide bounds on array requirements for average <b>DC</b> <b>input</b> <b>power.</b> Examination of the performance of several MAPSK sets reveals a distinct power advantage of quadrature amplitude shift keying (QASK) over most viable signal sets...|$|R

Technical performance and costs for both ends of the links are included. Spacecraft antenna or telescope efficiencies, pointing losses, ground-based or Earth-orbiting relay terminals efficiencies, noise temperatures, recurring and nonrecurring engineering, and maintenance and operations costs are modeled. Weather effects, dc-to-RF or laser power conversion efficiencies, gravity and other environment distortions gain reductions, and the cost of pointing and tracking are analyzed. The effort is focused primarily on the microwave frequency links. There are large uncertainties in the cost results, but conclusions indicate that for a mid- 1990 's launch, the Ka-band system is as cost effective as X-band. The Ka-band system has a data rate advantage as compared to the X-band system for the same <b>dc</b> <b>power</b> <b>input</b> to the spacecraft.

40|$|This {{invention}} is an electronically commutated {{brushless motor}} controller that incorporates Hall-array sensing in a small, 42 -gram package that provides 4096 absolute counts per motor revolution position sensing. The unit {{is the size}} of a miniature hockey puck, and is a 44 -pin male connector that provides many I/O channels, including CANbus, RS- 232 communications, general-purpose analog and digital I/O (GPIO), analog and digital Hall inputs, <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> <b>input</b> (18 - 90 VDC, 0 -l 0 A), three-phase motor outputs, and a strain gauge amplifier. This controller replaces air cooling with conduction cooling via a high-thermal-conductivity epoxy casting. A secondary advantage of the relatively good heat conductivity that comes with ultra-small size is that temperature differences within the controller become smaller, so that it is easier to measure the hottest temperature in the controller with fewer temperature sensors, or even one temperature sensor. Another size-sensitive design feature is in the approach to electrical noise immunity. At a very small size, where conduction paths are much shorter than in conventional designs, the ground becomes essentially isopotential, and so certain (space-consuming) electrical noise control components become unnecessary, which helps make small size possible. One winding-current sensor, applied to all of the windings in fast sequence, is smaller and wastes less power than the two or more sensors conventionally used to sense and control winding currents. An unexpected benefit of using only one current sensor is that it actually improves the precision of current control by using the "same" sensors to read each of the three phases. Folding the encoder directly into the controller electronics eliminates a great deal of redundant electronics, packaging, connectors, and hook-up wiring. The reduction of wires and connectors subtracts substantial bulk and eliminates their role in behaving as EMI (electro-magnetic interference) antennas. A shared knowledge by each motor controller of the state of all the motors in the system at 500 Hz also allows parallel processing of higher-level kinematic matrix calculations...|$|E
