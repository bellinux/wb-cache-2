5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} find wide use {{in liquid}} crystal displays, which {{rely on the}} optical properties of certain liquid crystalline substances in {{the presence or absence}} of an electric field. In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 μm thick) sits between two polarizers that are crossed (oriented at 90° to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see Twisted nematic <b>field</b> <b>effect).</b> This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels. Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles can be used to make other liquid crystal based optical devices.|$|E

In this paper, we present a computational camera solution coupled with real-time GPU processing to produce runtime dynamic Depth of <b>Field</b> <b>effects.</b> We first construct a hybrid-resolution stereo camera with a high-res/low-res camera pair. We recover a low-res disparity map of the scene using GPU-based Belief Propagation and subsequently upsample it via fast Cross/Joint Bilateral Upsampling. With the recovered high-resolution disparity map, we warp the high-resolution video stream to nearby viewpoints to synthesize a light field towards the scene. We exploit parallel processing and atomic operations on the GPU to resolve visibility when multiple pixels warp to the same image location. Finally, we generate dynamic Depth of <b>Field</b> <b>effects</b> from the synthesized light field rendering. All processing stages are mapped onto NVIDIA’s CUDA architecture.

A NOT gate, on the other hand, is fundamentally different from the majority gate, as shown in Figure 6.

VTVMs were used before the introduction of electronic high-impedance analog transistor and <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> transistor voltmeters (FETVOMs). Modern digital meters (DVMs) and some modern analog meters also use electronic input circuitry to achieve high input impedance—their voltage ranges are functionally equivalent to VTVMs. The input impedance of some poorly-designed DVMs (especially some early designs) would vary {{over the course of}} a sample-and-hold internal measurement cycle, causing disturbances to some sensitive circuits under test.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, under {{different}} titles, inventors conceived electro optical effects as alternatives to twisted nematic <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> LCDs (TN- and STN- LCDs). One approach {{was to use}} interdigital electrodes on one glass substrate only to produce an electric field essentially parallel to the glass substrates. To {{take full advantage of}} the properties of this In Plane Switching (IPS) technology further work was needed. After thorough analysis, details of advantageous embodiments are filed in Germany by Guenter Baur et al. and patented in various countries. which is not 0 or 90 degrees, filed Jan 9, 1990. The Fraunhofer Institute in Freiburg, where the inventors worked, assigns these patents to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, a supplier of LC substances. In 1992, shortly thereafter, engineers at Hitachi work out various practical details of the IPS technology to interconnect the thin-film transistor array as a matrix and to avoid undesirable stray fields in between pixels. Hitachi also improves the viewing angle dependence further by optimizing the shape of the electrodes (Super IPS). NEC and Hitachi become early manufacturers of active-matrix addressed LCDs based on the IPS technology. This is a milestone for implementing large-screen LCDs having acceptable visual performance for flat-panel computer monitors and television screens. In 1996, Samsung developed the optical patterning technique that enables multi-domain LCD. Multi-domain and In Plane Switching subsequently remain the dominant LCD designs through 2006. In 2007 the image quality of LCD televisions surpassed the image quality of cathode-ray-tube-based (CRT) TVs. In the fourth quarter of 2007, LCD televisions surpassed CRT TVs in worldwide sales for the first time. LCD TVs were projected to account 50% of the 200million TVs to be shipped globally in 2006, according to Displaybank. In October 2011, Toshiba announced 2560×1600 pixels on a 6.1-inch (155mm) LCD panel, suitable for use in a tablet computer, especially for Chinese character display.|$|E
