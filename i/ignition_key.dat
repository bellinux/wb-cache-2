5|$|On 6 August {{the police}} removed the McCanns' hired car. Keela and Eddie {{were taken to}} an {{underground}} car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 11 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car and inside the boot (trunk). Keela alerted to the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat, Kate's clothes and the Bible. The McCanns' lawyer said that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, {{it could have been}} caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.|$|E
25|$|Dual zone {{climate control}} was a {{standard}} feature across the WH range, as was 12-mode trip computer {{integrated into the}} instrument cluster. Caprice including rear roof mounted climate control and stereo controls for rear passengers- rear passengers were also provided with two headphone jacks in the rear parcel shelf and could listen to a different audio source to the front occupants. A rear flip down table was incorporated into the rear armrest, complete with storage pocket and cup holders. The exclusive-to-Caprice options included standard Howe leather seats, 260-watt 12-speaker DSP audio system, individual <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> memory (not available in Statesman- stereo settings, seating position) for three drivers, upright Holden crest logo on the bonnet, chrome exterior door handles, as well as heated side view mirrors and auto dipping passenger side view mirror to avoid alloy wheel damage when reversing. Headlights could be set to automatically sense low light levels and turn on without driver input. Caprice featured a fine chrome vertical bar grille, while Statesman used a chrome matrix style front grille design, and lacked chrome exterior door handles.|$|E
500|$|A Full Scale arcade {{version was}} {{released}} alongside the standard arcade version in 1993. This version {{was designed to}} give the player a more realistic driving experience. Players (a passenger could sit in the car next to the driver) sat inside an adapted red Eunos Roadster, the Japanese right-hand-drive version of the Mazda MX-5 Miata, and controlled the same car on-screen. The game was played {{in front of a}} [...] wide, front-projected triple screen (which benefited from dimmed ambient lighting), with the wheel, gear stick and pedals functioning as the controls. The <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> was used to start, the speed and RPM gauges were functional, and fans blew wind on the player from inside the air vents. Speakers concealed inside the car provided realistic engine and tyre sounds; overhead speakers provided surround music. The P.C.B. was located under the bonnet of the car.|$|E

2500|$|The 1949 {{model was}} {{equipped}} with an <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> and a starter push-button to engage the starter. Pushing the starter button would engage the starter, but if the <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> was not inserted, unlocking the ignition, the car would not start. The car {{was equipped with}} an oil bath air cleaner. At the bottom edge of the front fender directly behind the front wheel was a badge that said [...] "Futuramic" [...] which identified an Oldsmobile approach to simplified driving, {{and the presence of}} an automatic transmission. [...] Styling changes for the 1950 model include the replacement of a two-piece windshield with a one-piece unit and the addition of the Holiday hardtop coupe to the line. Also a three-speed manual transmission with column shift became available as a [...] "delete for credit" [...] option to the Hydra-Matic automatic transmission. The 88 now outsold the six-cylinder 76 lineup, which was dropped entirely after the 1950 model year. It had a 40ft. turning circle. [...] The 1950 model won the 1950 Carrera Panamericana.|$|E

2500|$|The 1969 model {{eliminated}} {{the front door}} vent windows, had a slight grille and taillight revision, moved the <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> from the dashboard to the steering column (which locked the steering wheel when the key was removed, a federal requirement installed one year ahead of schedule), and the gauge faces changed from steel blue to black. In addition, the rear quarter-panel mounted side marker lamps changed from a red lens shaped like the Pontiac [...] "arrowhead" [...] emblem to one shaped like the broad GTO badge. Front outboard headrests were made standard equipment on all GTOs built after January 1, 1969.|$|E

2500|$|The Olympic Torch {{is based}} on {{traditional}} scrolls and uses a traditional Chinese design known as [...] "Lucky Cloud". It is made from aluminum. It is 72 centimetres high and weighs 985grams. The torch is designed to remain lit in 65 kilometre per hour (37mile per hour) winds, and in rain of up to 50 millimetres (2inches) per hour. An <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> is used to ignite and extinguish the flame. The torch is fueled by cans of propane. Each can will light the torch for 15 minutes.

50|$|The {{dashboard}} is lit using electroluminescent {{panels in}} the gauge pods {{and on a}} call-out strip across the dash. This system did not use bulbs; instead, an inverter and transformer raised the battery voltage to over 100 volts AC and passed that high voltage through special plastic layers, causing the gauges to glow with a blue-green light. Instead of a water temperature gauge, the Chrysler Turbine has a Turbine Inlet temperature gauge with numbers 500, 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. All 55 turbine cars used identical <b>ignition</b> <b>keys.</b>|$|R
50|$|These are {{codes that}} require a chart or {{computer}} program to translate the blind code to a bitting code, {{which is used to}} create the actual key. Most key codes are blind codes, and publication of code books or software are restricted to licensed locksmiths in most jurisdictions for security reasons. Some locksmiths also create their own blind coding systems for identifying key systems they installed, or for customer identification and authorization in high security systems. Example: 23N7 (General Motors) or X2100 (Nissan) are examples of blind codes used for automotive <b>ignition</b> <b>keys.</b>|$|R

Its success prompted a revised Australian only model line up to be introduced in 1965, beginning with the Morris Mini Deluxe, the first to use Hydrolastic suspension,to have wind-up windows, <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> operated starter and an improved level of trim and options. Australian Minis were fitted with wind-up windows years ahead of their UK counterparts. Morris Mini Coopers and Cooper S were also made and supplied to the Australian and New Zealand Police forces as high speed pursuit vehicles.

2500|$|In 1999, {{the same}} way then 1996, there were two {{different}} phases: In the first one, the Beetle kept being sold {{the same way}} as in previous years (Volkswagen Sedán City and Volkswagen Sedán Clásico), while in the second one, both versions were replaced by a new [...] "unique" [...] version, mostly referred to as the Volkswagen Sedán Unificado, which takes the City's upholstery, and the improvements and the metallic colors from the Sedán Clásico. This new Volkswagen Beetle was the last regular version which remained unchanged until 2003. This year appeared, in addition to the anti-theft alarm and with the intention of lowering the high index of thefts and therefore, the extraordinarily expensive premiums of insurance policies, the Transponder, a device with an entry located in the dashboard, which allows the ignition and operation of the car. When it was offline, the car cannot even be started when using the <b>ignition</b> <b>key.</b>|$|E
2500|$|There {{was also}} an export version {{introduced}} in January 1969, the Suzuki Fronte 500 with the engine enlarged to 475cc. This was only built in De Luxe trim. The 500 produces [...] at 6000rpm, four more than does the original 360 export version. In May 1969 the Fronte received its first real facelift. The dashboard was modernized by two square gauges instead of a large oval one, the <b>ignition</b> <b>key</b> was moved from the dashboard to the steering column and the two-tone interior was changed to simply black. Externally, the decorative trim pieces in the front grille and on the air inlets at the rear were replaced by real grilles. First gear was also synchronized, unlike on earlier cars. In July 1969 the Fronte S appeared, which offered the SS equipment but with the more economical 25PS engine. Another facelift took place in April 1970, when the grille became more ornate and the sporting version was rebaptized [...] "SSS". Marketing materials referred to this version as the [...] "New Fronte". Two new engines of [...] were installed, while the original 25PS version was discontinued. The more powerful version was installed in the Hi-Super DX and S versions. Production ended in October 1970, {{in advance of the}} succeeding [...] "Stingray" [...] Fronte.|$|E
40|$|For my masters thesis I {{have pursued}} the {{cultural}} values that accompany vintage cars (cars manufactured between 1918 and 1931) across the English countryside.

Cars first became classified as “vintage ” with the establishment of the Vintage Sports-Car Club (VSCC) in the UK in 1934. In the following years “vintage ” came to adopt a variety of attributes and a number of historical narratives became associated with it. As my project involves looking into the culture of the time when these cars were manufactured I found myself in various specialist libraries and archives delving through historical documents, especially relating to the founding of the VSCC.

50|$|The {{need for}} the {{emission}} of signals at two different frequencies was eliminated {{by the development of}} uniwave methods. In one uniwave method, called the <b>ignition</b> method, <b>keying</b> would start and stop the arc. The arc chamber would have a striker rod that shorted out the two electrodes through a resistor and extinguished the arc. The key would energize an electromagnet that would move the striker and reignite the arc. For this method to work, the arc chamber had to be hot. The method was feasible for arc converters up to about 5 kW.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{our success}} in defeating {{the security of}} an RFID device known as a Digital Signature Transponder (DST). Manufactured by Texas Instruments, DST (and variant) devices help secure millions of SpeedPass TM payment transponders and automobile <b>ignition</b> <b>keys.</b> Our analysis of the DST involved three phases: 1. Reverse engineering: Starting from a rough published schematic, we determined the complete functional details of the cipher underpinning the challenge-response protocol in the DST. We accomplished this with only “oracle ” or “black-box ” access to an ordinary DST, that is, by experimental observation of responses output by the device. 2. Key cracking: The key length for the DST is only 40 bits. With an array of of sixteen FPGAs operating in parallel, we can recover a DST key in under an hour using two responses to arbitrary challenges. 3. Simulation: Given the key (and serial number) of a DST, {{we are able to}} simulate its RF output so as to spoof a reader. As validation of our results, we purchased gasoline at a service station and started an automobile using simulated DST devices. We accomplished all of these steps using inexpensive off-the-shelf equipment, and with minimal RF expertise. This suggests that an attacker with modest resources can emulate a target DST after brief short-range scanning or long-range eavesdropping across several authentication sessions. We conclude that the cryptographic protection afforded by the DST device is relatively weak...|$|R
