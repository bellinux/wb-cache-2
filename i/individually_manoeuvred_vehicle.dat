40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the ego-localization problem for an outdoor vehicle {{equipped}} with proprioceptive sensors. In a current way, the ego-localisation consists in two stages (prediction and updating of the vehicle state) {{in order to provide}} a new vehicle state with its associated uncertainty. Previous works have proved the efficiency of several type of algorithms. Among them, we can quote the IMM (Interacting Multiple Model) approach. IMM is based on the discretization of the vehicle motion space modeled by simple manoeuvres, such as Constant Velocity (CT) or Constant Turn (CT) models. This yields a very adapted approach for heavily <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Unfortunately, without GPS data, this approach becomes difficult to use. The idea is to combine different kind of proprioceptive information by using the IMM (Interacting Multiple Model) approach in a credibilistic way for the likelihood model updating in the prediction stage. In our case, data are coming from dead reckoning sensors. This kind of sensors complement the GPS for updating the vehicle state as well as the model likelihood...|$|R

40|$|Deceleration {{characteristics}} of vehicles {{are important for}} intersection design, deceleration lane design, traffic simulation modeling, vehicular emission and fuel consumption modeling, etc. Heterogeneous traffic stream consists of vehicles with wide variation in their physical dimensions, weight to power ratio and dynamic characteristics, which affect their deceleration behaviour. Majority of past studies are restricted to deceleration behaviour study of cars and trucks in homogenous traffic. Present study aims to analyze the deceleration behaviour of different vehicles types (like truck, car, motorized two and three-wheeler) on Nagpur-Mumbai Express Highway at Wardha, India. Drivers were asked to decelerate their vehicles from their maximum speed to zero speed in shortest time and their speed profiles are collected using Global Positioning System. Deceleration behaviour of different vehicle types is significantly different. Vehicles with higher maximum speed have higher deceleration time, deceleration distance, maximum and mean deceleration rates during their deceleration manoeuvre. In deceleration <b>manoeuvre,</b> <b>vehicle’s</b> deceleration rate initially increases, attains the maximum deceleration and decreases afterwards. A dual regime model is developed to describe deceleration behaviour over entire speed range of all vehicle types except car. For car, a second order polynomial is proposed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} guiding a mobile robot towards a target using only range sensors. The bearing information is not available. The target can be stationary or moving. It can {{be the source of}} some gas leakage or nuclear radiation or it can be some landmark or beacon or any <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The mobile robot can be a ground vehicle or an aerial vehicle flying at a fixed altitude. In literature, many different strategies are proposed which use the range only measurement but they involve estimation of different parameters or have switching control strategy which make them difficult to implement. We propose two sets of conditions, one for stationary target and another for both stationary and moving target. Any control strategy, that will satisfy these conditions, can bring the robot arbitrarily close to the target. There are no restrictions on the initial conditions. Estimation of any parameter is not required. Some candidate controllers are presented that included continuous controllers and switching controllers. Simulations are carried out with these controllers to validate our result with and without measurement noise. Experimental results with ground mobile robot are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The multi-criteria {{trajectory}} {{planning for}} Space <b>Manoeuvre</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (SMV) is recognised as a challenging problem. Because of the nonlinearity and {{uncertainty in the}} dynamic model and even the objectives, {{it is hard for}} decision makers to balance all of the preference indices without violating strict path and box constraints. In this paper, to provide the designer an effective method and solve the trajectory hopping problem, an Interactive Fuzzy Physical Programming (IFPP) algorithm is introduced. A new multi-objective SMV optimal control problem is formulated and parameterized using an adaptive technique. By using the density function, the oscillations of the trajectory can be captured effectively. In addition, an interactive decision-making strategy is applied to modify the current designer’s preferences during optimization process. Two realistic decision-making scenarios are conducted by using the proposed algorithm; Simulation results indicated that without driving objective functions out of the tolerable region, the proposed approach can have better performance in terms of the satisfactory degree compared with other approaches like traditional weighted-sum method, Goal Programming (GP) and fuzzy goal programming (FGP). Also, the results can satisfy the current preferences given by the decision makers. Therefore, The method is potentially feasible for solving multi-criteria SMV trajectory planning problems...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{constrained}} trajectory optimization for Space <b>Manoeuvre</b> <b>Vehicles</b> (SMV) is {{a challenging}} problem. In practice, this problem becomes more difficult when multiple mission requirements {{are taken into}} account. Because of the nonlinearity in the dynamic model and even the objectives, it is usually hard for designers to generate a compromised trajectory without violating strict path and box constraints. In this paper, a new multi-objective SMV optimal control model is formulated and parameterized using combined shooting-collocation technique. A modified game theory approach, coupled with an adaptive differential evolution algorithm, is designed in order to generate the pareto front of the multi-objective trajectory optimization problem. In addition, {{to improve the quality}} of obtained solutions, a control logic is embedded in the framework of the proposed approach. Several existing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are studied and compared with the proposed method. Simulation results indicate that without driving the solution out of the feasible region, the proposed method can perform better in terms of convergence ability and convergence speed than its counterparts. Moreover, the quality of the pareto set generated using the proposed method is higher than other multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, which means the newly proposed algorithm is more attractive for solving multi-criteria SMV trajectory planning problem...|$|R

Furthermore, using an exclusive heavy vehicle lane changing decision model can increase the accuracy of the microscopic traffic simulation software in estimating the macroscopic traffic flow measurements...|$|R
