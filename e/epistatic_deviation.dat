(1965) and Irimescu and ªtefanic (1998) proved. In this way, phos-phate ions are adsorbed by aluminium hydroxide phys-ico-chemically and the real saccharase potential of soil can be obtained correctly.

40|$|Three single hybrids were crossed with 12 {{early and}} late (flint and dent) inbred lines. The {{three-way}} and single crosses were compared for the influence of epistasis on grain yield. The inbred lines with the same growing sea-son used as female and male parents were involved in significant epistatic effects. Depiste {{the fact that both}} flint and dent types of inbreds were included in the pre-sent study, the obtained epistatic deviations were com-parable in frequency with other studies with only dent inbred lines. The use of single crosses as parents for three-way crosses was found to cause under estimation of the positive and overestimation of the negative epistatic deviations. The group of three-way hybrids with late parental lines recorded the lowest number of three-way crosses with epistatic deviations from the predicted performances.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of multilocus systems under weak selection is investigated. Generations are discrete and nonoverlapping; the monoecious population mates at random. The number of multiallelic loci, the linkage map, dominance, and epistasis are arbitrary. The genotypic fitnesses {{may depend on}} the gametic frequencies and time. The results hold for s 0], and then the population evolves approximately {{as if it were}} in linkage equilibrium, the error in the gametic frequencies being O(s). Suppose the explicit time dependence (if any) of the genotypic fitnesses is O(s(2)). Then after a time t(2) ~ 2 t(1), the linkage disequilibria are nearly constant, their rate of change being O(s(2)). Furthermore, with an error of O(s(2)), each linkage disequilibrium is proportional to the corresponding <b>epistatic</b> <b>deviation</b> for the interaction of additive effects on fitness. If the genotypic fitnesses change no faster than at the rate O(s(3)), then the single-generation change in the mean fitness is ΔW = W(- 1) V(g) + O(s(3)), where V(g) designates the genic (or additive genetic) variance in fitness. The mean of a character with genotypic values whose single-generation change does not exceed O(s(2)) evolves at the rate ΔZ = W(- 1) C(g) + O(s(2)), where C(g) represents the genic covariance of the character and fitness (i. e., the covariance of the average effect on the character and the average excess for fitness of every allele that affects the character). Thus, after a short time t(2), the absolute error in the fundamental and secondary theorems of natural selection is small, though the relative error may be large...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Understanding {{interactions}} between mutations {{and how they}} affect fitness is a central problem in evolutionary biology that bears on such fundamental issues as the structure of fitness landscapes {{and the evolution of}} sex. To date, analyses of fitness landscapes have focused either on the overall directional curvature of the fitness landscape or on the distribution of pairwise interactions. In this paper, we propose and employ a new mathematical approach that allows a more complete description of multi-way interactions and provides new insights into the structure of fitness landscapes. Results We apply the mathematical theory of gene interactions developed by Beerenwinkel et al. to a fitness landscape for Escherichia coli obtained by Elena and Lenski. The genotypes were constructed by introducing nine mutations into a wild-type strain and constructing a restricted set of 27 double mutants. Despite the absence of mutants higher than second order, our analysis of this genotypic space points to previously unappreciated gene interactions, in addition to the standard pairwise epistasis. Our analysis confirms Elena and Lenski's inference that the fitness landscape is complex, so that an overall measure of curvature obscures a diversity of interaction types. We also demonstrate that some mutations contribute disproportionately to this complexity. In particular, some mutations are systematically better than others at mixing with other mutations. We also find a strong correlation between epistasis and the average fitness loss caused by deleterious mutations. In particular, the <b>epistatic</b> <b>deviations</b> from multiplicative expectations tend toward more positive values in the context of more deleterious mutations, emphasizing that pairwise epistasis is a local property of the fitness landscape. Finally, we determine the geometry of the fitness landscape, which reflects many of these biologically interesting features. Conclusion A full description of complex fitness landscapes requires more information than the average curvature or the distribution of independent pairwise interactions. We have proposed a mathematical approach that, in principle, allows a complete description and, in practice, can suggest new insights into the structure of real fitness landscapes. Our analysis emphasizes the value of non-independent genotypes for these inferences. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background A major QTL for fatness and growth, denoted FAT 1, has {{previously}} been detected on pig chromosome 4 q (SSC 4 q) using a Large White – wild boar intercross. Progeny that carried the wild boar allele at this locus had higher fat deposition, shorter length of carcass, and reduced growth. The position and the estimated effects of the FAT 1 QTL for growth and fatness have been confirmed in a previous study. In order to narrow down the QTL interval we have traced the inheritance of the wild boar allele associated with high fat deposition through six additional backcross generations. Results Progeny-testing {{was used to determine}} the QTL genotype for 10 backcross sires being heterozygous for different parts of the broad FAT 1 region. The statistical analysis revealed that five of the sires were segregating at the QTL, two were negative while the data for three sires were inconclusive. We could confirm the QTL effects on fatness/meat content traits but not for the growth traits implying that growth and fatness are controlled by distinct QTLs on chromosome 4. Two of the segregating sires showed highly significant QTL effects that were as large as previously observed in the F 2 generation. The estimates for the remaining three sires, which were all heterozygous for smaller fragments of the actual region, were markedly smaller. With the sample sizes {{used in the present study}} we cannot with great confidence determine whether these smaller effects in some sires are due to chance <b>deviations,</b> <b>epistatic</b> interactions or whether FAT 1 is composed of two or more QTLs, each one with a smaller phenotypic effect. Under the assumption of a single locus, the critical region for FAT 1 has been reduced to a 3. 3 cM interval between the RXRG and SDHC loci. Conclusion We have further characterized the FAT 1 QTL on pig chromosome 4 and refined its map position considerably, from a QTL interval of 70 cM to a maximum region of 20 cM and a probable region as small as 3. 3 cM. The flanking markers for the small region are RXRG and SDHC and the orthologous region of FAT 1 in the human genome is located on HSA 1 q 23. 3 and harbors approximately 20 genes. Our strategy to further refine the map position of this major QTL will be i) to type new markers in our pigs that are recombinant in the QTL interval and ii) to perform Identity-By-Descent (IBD) mapping across breeds that have been strongly selected for lean growth. </p...|$|R
40|$|Maize (Zea mays L.) breeders have {{successfully}} exploited heterosis by crossing inbred lines to develop hybrid cultivars. Epistatic effects can {{contribute significantly to}} the expression of heterosis for specific hybrids. The hybrid B 73 x Mo 17 was a widely grown hybrid with exceptional performance in the central U. S. Corn Belt during the late 19702 ̆ 7 s and early 19802 ̆ 7 s. It is possible that favorable epistatic effects contributed {{to the performance of}} B 73 x Mo 17. The objectives of this study were to use the triple testcross design to determine if epistatic effects contribute significantly to the performance of B 73 x Mo 17, estimate additive and dominance genetic variances and the average level of dominance for the F[subscript] 2 population derived from B 73 x Mo 17, and use weighted least squares to determine the importance of digenic epistatic variances relative to additive and dominance variances;The analyses of variance suggested that epistatic effects were important for several traits. Comparison of testcross mean determined that epistatic deviations were different from zero for all traits. The deviation for grain yield was 7. 0 g plant[superscript]- 1. The B 73 testcrosses contributed significantly to the <b>epistatic</b> <b>deviation</b> for grain yield. Expression of epistasis was significantly affected by environments;Genetic variances were estimated using Design III and weighted least squares analyses. Both analyses determined that dominance variance was more important than additive variance for grain yield. For other traits additive genetic variance was more important than dominance variance. The average level of dominance suggests overdominant gene effects were present for grain yield;Epistatic variances were generally not significantly different from zero and, therefore, were relatively less important than additive and dominance variances. For several traits additive by additive epistatic variance decreased estimates of additive genetic variance. In general, the decrease in additive genetic variance was not significant...|$|E
