Maxwell next guesses that Kath <b>has</b> <b>jumped</b> {{in front of the}} train, and Les repeatedly hits him with a pillow as Jorg defecates into Kath's shoebox, which is held by Hugo. Shona sees that the train has hit a deer, and Kath re-enters.|$|E
5|$|The second {{aspect of}} the {{compensation}} system involves the start gate position. If the gate is changed at any point during a round after at least one athlete <b>has</b> <b>jumped,</b> then all subsequent athletes are individually penalised with a points deduction based on how many positions the gate was moved up, or awarded additional points for the gate being lowered. In variable wind conditions requiring either a higher or lower inrun speed than originally anticipated, {{it is not uncommon}} for many gate changes to be made as a round wears on. In the era prior to gate compensation, athletes who had jumped before a gate adjustment had to quickly make their way back up the hill to jump again, which was always logistically difficult to arrange due to time constraints.|$|E

One such text attacked the poet laureate Octavian Goga, accusing him and other Transylvanian refugees of hoarding bureaucratic positions in the Kingdom of Romania. In a 1913 piece, Arghezi targeted scholar Ioan Bianu for allegedly mismanaging the Romanian Academy Library: [...] "From his longjohns and his cleated boots, Mr. Bianu <b>has</b> <b>jumped</b> straight into the aristocracy and [...] turned our library [...] into his own, Transylvanian, empire. [...] An impertinent voice submits one to a detailed interrogation. It is Mr. Bianu, a jaundiced liver with a moustache, with the evil gaze {{of a man who}} collects many salaries but is aware of his own voidness and dullness".|$|E
500|$|The stress {{fracture}} theory {{was supported by}} the testimony of former crewmen. Former Second Mate Richard Orgel, who served on Fitzgerald in 1972 and 1973, testified that [...] "the ship had a tendency to bend and spring during storms 'like a diving board after somebody <b>has</b> <b>jumped</b> off. Orgel was quoted as saying that the loss of Fitzgerald was caused by hull failure, [...] "pure and simple. I detected undue stress in the side tunnels by examining the white enamel paint, which will crack and splinter when submitted to severe stress." [...] George H. [...] "Red" [...] Burgner, Fitzgeralds steward for ten seasons and winter ship-keeper for seven years, testified in a deposition that a [...] "loose keel" [...] contributed to the vessel's loss. Burgner further testified that [...] "the keel and sister kelsons were only 'tack welded'" [...] and that he had personally observed that many of the welds were broken. Burgner was not asked to testify before the Marine Board of Inquiry.|$|E

Seeing {{the reflection of the}} moon in the water {{at the bottom of the}} well, the wolf believes there to be cheese down there and lowers the fox down to pick it up. When he complains that it is too heavy for him to lift alone, the wolf jumps into the other bucket and descends to help. However, this pulls up the other bucket, into which the fox <b>has</b> <b>jumped,</b> and so the two swap places; the wolf at the bottom of the well and the fox safely escaped. The narrator professes that he does not know who helped the wolf out of the well, but that the tale is at an end.|$|E
500|$|On July 11, 2008, Shinoda's second {{public art}} show [...] "Glorious Excess (BORN)" [...] premiered at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. The show {{included}} nine new pieces, with an exclusive signing on opening night. The show served as part {{one of the}} two-part [...] "Glorious Excess" [...] series, with the second installment [...] "Glorious Excess (DIES)" [...] due at JANM on August 22, 2009. Shinoda commented on the inspiration behind the Glorious Excess series, stating, [...] "It Got {{to a point where}} the pervasiveness of 'celebrity news' concerned me. It seemed like it <b>has</b> <b>jumped</b> out of its niche into places where it doesn't belong. I would be watching the news, and thinking, 'of all the things {{going on in the world}} right now, why are they covering so-and-so's breakup?' It didn't make sense to me. Add to that the fact that I'm supposed to somehow 'belong' to that celebrity group—and I really don't feel like I do in a lot of ways—and you can see how the topic started to become really interesting to me. The Glorious Excess (BORN) show was my way of diving into those topics, trying to find answers. It follows a central 'celebrity' character, who is filthy rich, slightly violent, and famous without any particular skill or talent." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Count and Countess return. The Countess, {{thinking}} herself trapped, desperately {{admits that}} Cherubino is {{hidden in the}} closet. The enraged Count draws his sword, promising to kill Cherubino on the spot, but when the door is opened, they both find to their astonishment only Susanna (Finale: Esci omai, garzon malnato – [...] "Come out of there, you ill-born boy!"). The Count demands an explanation; the Countess tells him it is a practical joke, to test his trust in her. Shamed by his jealousy, the Count begs for forgiveness. When the Count presses about the anonymous letter, Susanna and the Countess reveal that {{the letter was written}} by Figaro, and then delivered by Basilio. Figaro then arrives and tries to start the wedding festivities, but the Count berates him with questions about the anonymous note. Just as the Count is starting to run out of questions, Antonio the gardener arrives, complaining that a man <b>has</b> <b>jumped</b> out of the window and broken his flowerpots. The Count immediately realizes that the jumping fugitive was Cherubino, but Figaro claims it was he himself who jumped out of the window, and claims to have injured his foot while landing. Figaro, Susanna, and the Countess attempt to discredit Antonio as a chronic drunkard whose constant inebriation makes him unreliable and prone to fantasy, but Antonio brings forward a paper which, he says, was dropped by the escaping man. The Count orders Figaro to prove he was the jumper by identifying the paper (which is, in fact, Cherubino's appointment to the army). Figaro is at a loss, but Susanna and the Countess manage to signal the correct answers, and Figaro identifies the document. His victory is, however, short-lived: Marcellina, Bartolo, and Basilio enter, bringing charges against Figaro and demanding that he honor his contract to marry Marcellina. The Count happily postpones the wedding in order to investigate the charge.|$|E
