40|$|The {{biodegradability}} of {{oxidized starch}} and inulin {{has been studied}} {{in relation to the}} degree of periodate oxidation to dialdehyde derivatives, by measuring oxygen consumption and mineralization to carbon dioxide. A higher degree of oxidation of <b>dialdehyde</b> <b>starch</b> and dialdchyde inulin results in a lower rate at which the polymers are biodegraded. It is demonstrated that the biodegradation rate of dialdehyde inulin derivatives decreases more than that of equivalent starch derivatives. The differences in biodegradation behavior between <b>dialdehyde</b> <b>starch</b> and dialdehyde inulin, resulting from comparable modifications, are discussed in terms of conformational structure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the difference in}} relative reactivity of the aldehyde groups present in <b>dialdehyde</b> <b>starch</b> towards different oxidising agents. The oxidation of <b>dialdehyde</b> <b>starch</b> with peracetic acid and sodium bromide leads to only partial oxidation to give mono-aldehyde-carboxy starch, while oxidation with sodium chlorite results in dicarboxy derivatives. In order to obtain a more in depth insight into this phenomenon, the products obtained after partial oxidation via both routes were isolated and characterised. The results showed a pronounced difference in preferences between the two carbonyl groups towards the different oxidising agents. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA...|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} effort worldwide {{is being}} directed toward development of novel biocides against drug-resistant bacterial and viruses {{because of the}} significant potential human infection risks in the general population. We report here {{the discovery of a}} strong antiviral biocide, dialdheyde starch (DAS). Antiviral tests were carried out against three non-envelop viruses, including two bacterial viruses MS 2 and PRD 1, and one human virus Poliovirus. <b>Dialdehyde</b> <b>starch</b> aqueous suspensions were effective biocides against these three test viruses in a 1 hr exposure test. The antiviral activity was significantly enhanced in a four-hour exposure test, with maximum seven orders of magnitude reductions against MS 2 and PRD 1, and four-order reduction against Poliovirus. The antiviral activity of <b>dialdehyde</b> <b>starch</b> was found to be pH dependent, being more active in alkaline and acidic conditions than in neutral conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterial}} inactivation kinetics of <b>dialdehyde</b> <b>starch</b> (DAS) aqueous suspension was studied by {{the relationship between}} the minimal lethal concentration (MLC) and the inactivation time at four different temperatures. The relationship between MLC and exposure time was found to follow the first-order Chick-Watson law. This first-order inactivation kinetics was modeled by pseudo-first order chemical reaction.

40|$|Hydrophobic <b>dialdehyde</b> <b>starch</b> (HDAS) was {{synthesized}} by <b>dialdehyde</b> <b>starch</b> (DAS) and eighteen-alkyl primary amine as the {{raw material}} in DMSO. The effect of the reaction conditions on the yield of HDAS was investigated such as catalyst content, reaction temperature, reaction time, and the in-feed molar ratio of -CHO/-NH 2. Moreover, the optimized test parameters were obtained by conducting orthogonal experiment. The molecular structure and the morphology of HDAS were characterized via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). And the thermal stability and the hydrophobic properties of HDAS were investigated by thermal gravimetric analyzer (TG) and the hydrophobic testing. The {{results indicate that the}} yield of HDAS is the highest up to 44. 21 %, with feed composition 1 [*]:[*] 0. 9, reaction temperature 40 °C, reaction time 8 [*]h, and acetic acid content 3 %. And the introduction of the long-chain alkyl groups into the DAS backbones will ameliorate efficaciously the thermal stability and the hydrophobic properties of DAS, which almost has no effect on the DAS particle size...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dialdehyde</b> <b>starch</b> {{obtained}} by periodate oxidation from potato starch was converted into its disemicarbazone (DSC), dithiosemicarbazone (DTSC), dihydrazone (DHZ) and dioxime (DOX). The Cu(II) complexes of these compounds were prepared and characterized by Raman and EPR spectra, {{as well as}} by the measurements of magnetic susceptibility. EPR investigations showed that two types of complexes with different surroundings of copper centres existed in each starch derivative. Besides nitrogen atoms of the C=N moiety and sulphur atoms of the C=S moiety, also oxygen atoms from starch hydroxyl groups and/or water molecule were proposed as the coordination sites for the central copper ions...|$|E

40|$|Human {{umbilical}} veins {{were prepared}} as vascular grafts by tanning with <b>dialdehyde</b> <b>starch</b> or gluteraldehyde and by structural re-inforcement with an outer polyester fiber mesh. These grafts were implanted in baboons in the aortoiliac position for periods of 3 days to 9 months. There was no aneurysm formation {{and there was}} an excellent maintenance of patency as well as function. Histologic evaluation of the graft materials showed a dense collagen layer within the encircling polyester fiber mesh. A multicellular subintimal layer formed a discrete inner capsule. The inflammatory response with the umbilical component was insignificant. There was no evidence of rejection. This study suggests that the modified umbilical vein can serve as a satisfactory blood conduit. Experience with three short-term clinical implants supports the applicability and potential for this new vascular graft...|$|E

40|$|<b>Dialdehyde</b> <b>starch</b> (DAS) {{was added}} to pork ham batter. The effects of DAS on the meat protein gel during heating were {{investigated}} using thermal and rheological analyses. In this study, the degree of DAS oxidation was controlled by the reaction time. The DSC thermogram showed that increasing the degree of oxidation resulted in DAS having a higher gelatinization temperature and lower heat absorption. In dialdehyde starch/meat (DAS/M) composites, meat protein reduced the availability of water to starch and raised the gelatinization temperature and heat absorbed by the composites. The G(max) of the composites was greater than the linear combination of their components. The rheological properties of DAS were a major factor affecting the properties of its composites. Scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy {{with the aid of}} histologic technique revealed the network and distribution of DAS and DAS/M composites.

40|$|Feather keratin (FK) {{extracted}} from feathers represents a valuable source of biodegradable and biocompatible polymer. The {{aim of this}} study was the development and characterization of blended films based on FK and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) cross-linked by <b>dialdehyde</b> <b>starch</b> (DAS) for a potential drug release application. The compatibility of FK/PVA was improved when cross-linked by DAS: the relative crystallinity of the PVA/FK film slightly decreased, and the enthalpy value for the melting peak decreased by about 50 % for the cross-linked films. The total soluble mass of all blend films in water was below 35 % at 37 °C, indicating a good stability of the films in water. The results of the Rhodamine B dye (as a model drug) release tests showed that the release rates decreased with increasing DAS content. DAS-induced cross-linking improves several important properties of the FK/PVA films, such as the compactness, the compatibility, and the stability in water. These improvements offer the potential to expand the application of FK films in the biomaterial field...|$|E
40|$|Segments of rat {{inferior}} vena cava were {{modified by}} proteolytic digestion and <b>dialdehyde</b> <b>starch</b> tanning {{in an attempt}} to alter their antigenic nature and increase their tensile strength. These tissues were found to retain their ability to sensitize allogeneic recipients in both the intradermal and intra-aortic positions in all 50 experimental animals. Furthermore, these grafts had a very high aneurysm formation (100 %), and aneurysm rupture (54 %) rate even in isogeneic recipients, suggesting that the modification procedure so damages the structural integrity of venous tissue that its use in clinical situations may have disastrous consequences. Histologic evidence of intimal thickening, elastic disruption, and often severe acute and chronic inflammation supported the gross evidence of mechanical and immunologic damage and suggests that a mild brief course of immunosuppression may be indicated in clinical trials in situation in which autogenous saphenous vein in unavailable. Although the use of prosthetic mesh support for the graft may help to avoid structural changes, the introduction of synthetic materials may offset the theoretical advantages of the venous tissue...|$|E
30|$|Erythritol is a four-carbon sugar alcohol, {{which is}} applied as flavour enhancer, {{formulation}} aid, humectants, stabilizer, thickener, and as low-calorie sweetener, {{of which the}} latter is the main utilization. It has a natural occurrence in several foods including beer, sake, wine, soy sauce, water melon, pear and grape (O’Donnell and Kearsley [2012]; Sreenath and Venkatesh [2008]) and is well tolerated by the human body (Munro et al. [1998]). Erythritol can be chemically synthesized from <b>dialdehyde</b> <b>starch</b> with a nickel catalyst at high temperatures, but this process is not stereospecific and low in yield, and therefore, not industrialized (Moon et al. [2010]). Instead erythritol is produced in biotechnological processes using osmophilic yeasts obtained by random mutagenesis as Aureobasidium sp. (Ishizuka et al. [1989]; Sasaki et al. [1990]), Trichosporonoides sp. (Suh et al. [1999]), (Torula sp. Oh et al. [2001]), and Candida magnoliae (Koh et al. [2003]; Ryu et al. [2000]). As substrate a highly concentrated glucose solution (typically 40 % (w/v)) is applied, which is gained from chemically and enzymatically hydrolyzed wheat- and cornstarch. It serves as carbon source and causes high osmotic pressure, which pushes the yeast to produce the osmolyte erythritol (reviewed by (Moon et al. [2010])).|$|E

A material is to be developed so that it fulfils {{the requirements of the}} industry regarding to mechanical and electrical characteristics. As a comparison material, a polymer based on fossil raw materials is manufactured and stabilized with glass-fibre layers. Commercial wheat adhesive, corn adhesive native potatoes starch and <b>dialdehyde</b> <b>starch</b> are used as raw materials. The methods for the functionality of proteins are used for the well soluble preparations. Correlation between the solubility and the emulsifying ability exist. With the investigation of the interaction of the protein components with water, the reorientations of the tertiary structure of the proteins are clarified according to the formation of new structures. The moisture distribution and sorption behaviour of the biomaterials are examined. The influence of the composition, the manufacturing processes preheating conditions; structuring conditions and the portion of water in the mixtures on the material properties are studied.

40|$|A {{new class}} of injectable, {{biocompatible}} and biodegradable hydrogel is reported. This hydrogel is derived from N-succinyl chitosan (SCS) mixed with water-soluble <b>dialdehyde</b> <b>starch</b> (DAS) without using a conventional chemical crosslinker. The hybrid hydrogel is formed owing to the Schiff’s base reaction between amine groups of SCS and dialdehyde groups of DAS to form CHN group. SCS, DAS, and SCS–DAS hybrid hydrogels were synthesized and then characterized by FTIR analysis spectroscopy. The influence of SCS:DAS ratio in hybrid polymers solution on physicochemical properties of resultant hydrogels (e. g. gelation time, gel fraction (%) and equilibrium swelling ratio), surface morphology, in vitro weight loss (%), and mechanical stability was examined. The results demonstrated that SCS content has a profound role for forming tighter crosslinked hybrid hydrogels, where the increase of SCS content reduces the time for hydrogel forming. Also, the water uptake and hydrolytic weight loss decrease. Meanwhile, the DAS content increases, and mechanical properties of SCS–DAS hybrid hydrogels decrease. Curcumin release profile and adhered HGF cells on hydrogel surface sharply influenced the SCS portion in hybrid hydrogel composition. The SCS–DAS hybrid hydrogel properties afforded a possible opportunity {{to be used as}} a covalent in situ forming hybrid hydrogels in biomedical applications such as, tissue engineering and cartilage repair...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} employing starch-protein hydrolysate of amaranth flour to produce protective edible coatings on butter. Tests were run on 3 types of coating solutions. The first {{was made in}} such manner that to hydrolysate of 40 -% dry matter content, 30 -% (w/w) plasticiser (glycerol) was added and also 3 -% (w/w) emulsifying agent (lecithin). The second and third contained an extra 2 -% (w/w) antioxidant (ascorbic acid) and the third an extra 2 -% (w/w) cross-linking agent (<b>dialdehyde</b> <b>starch).</b> Protective layers on butter were produced by coating with coat solutions. Butters were stored {{for a total of}} 96 days in refrigerator at a temperature of 7 ± 1. 5 °C and relative humidity of 36 ± 3 %. The objective was to investigate the oxidation course of butter with protective coatings, butter wrapped in original wrapping and butter without wrapping/coat. Determined values were peroxide value, acid value and anisidine value. Results of butters with protective and edible polymer coatings displayed a similar oxidation course to that of butter in standard wrapping. Butter with a coat containing antioxidant exhibited slightly lower levels of peroxide value during storage than butter in original wrapping, which confirms good barrier properties to oxygen of the coating thus prepared...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{solubility}} (PS) {{values of}} different soy protein isolate (SPI) films were determined in water, 0. 01 N HCl, 0. 01 N NaOH, 4 M urea, and 0. 2 M 2 -mercaptoethanol. Tensile and color (L, a, and b values) properties of films also were determined. Control films were cast from heated (70 degrees C for 20 min), alkaline (pH 10) aqueous solutions of SPI (5 g/ 100 mL of water) and glycerin (50 % w/w of SPI). Additional films were cast after incorporation of <b>dialdehyde</b> <b>starch</b> (DAS) at 10 % w/w of SPI or {{small amounts of}} formaldehyde in the film-forming solutions. Also, control film samples were subjected to heat curing (90 degrees C for 24 h), UV radiation (51. 8 J/m(2)), or adsorption of formaldehyde vapors. PS of control films was highest (P < 0. 05) in 2 -mercaptoethanol, confirming the importance of disulfide bonds in SPI film formation. All treatments were effective in reducing (P < 0. 05) film PS in all solvents. Both DAS and adsorbed formaldehyde rendered the protein in films practically insoluble in all solvents. Adsorption of formaldehyde vapors and heat curing also substantially increased (P < 0. 05) film tensile strength from 8. 2 to 15. 8 or 14. 7 MPa, respectively. However, heat curing decreased (P < 0. 05) film elongation at break from 30 to 6 %. Most treatments had small but significant (P < 0. 05) effects on b color values, with DAS-containing films having the greatest (P < 0. 05) mean b value (most yellowish). Also, DAS-containing, heat-cured, and UV-irradiated films were darker, as evidenced by their lower (P < 0. 05) L values, than control films. It was demonstrated that PS of SPI films can be notably modified through chemical or physical treatments prior to or after casting...|$|E
