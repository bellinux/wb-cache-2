"Who {{better to}} say those things don't matter than {{somebody}} who's experienced them? , 'How {{can you say}} they don't matter? <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> money won't bring you happiness if you don't {{have a lot of}} money? <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> fame and fortune are not a guarantee for happiness and joy and fulfillment in your life?' You have to have that experience to know. 'Cause you have all those things, I've had all those things, and I've had nothing but chaos around me. So I'm just sharing what I know with the world. 'Cause I do think that we've become completely consumed with being rich and famous, our society has. And I just want to tell people, take it from me, I have all those things and none of them ever brought me one minute of happiness." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Julian Tudor Hart, {{before the}} mid-1960s poor {{conditions}} and low expectations existed as GPs were taught entirely by specialists in hospitals; back then GPs were {{men who had}} failed to become specialists and were unable {{to work in a}} hospital. Or as Lord Moran wrote in 1966: [...] "I was dean of St. Mary’s Hospital [...] for 25 years.[...] all the people of outstanding merit, with few exceptions, aimed to get on the staff. There was no other aim, and it was a ladder off which some of them fell. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the people who get {{to the top of the}} ladder are the same as the people who fall off it? It seems to me so ludicrous." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{presidents have}} also {{commented on the}} {{reputational}} survey. [...] Former president of Scripps College, Nancy Y. Bekavac also stated in a press release on the college website that Scripps will also no longer submit the Reputational Survey to U.S. News as [...] "for years we have known of flaws in the methodology; {{many of us have}} spoken with editors at U.S. News in an attempt to improve its approach [...] but nothing can really improve a system that seeks to reduce 3,300 educational programs in American higher education to one set of numbers, and then rank them. College presidents, academic deans and deans of admission do not know enough about other institutions to make meaningful comparisons. This gives a false sense of reliability to what is a ranking system without any real validity." [...] Sweet Briar College president, Elizabeth S. Muhlenfeld stated that, [...] "one of our colleagues likened it to trying to rank composers. It's a great analogy. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Beethoven and Brahms are better than Mahler or Mozart?" [...] Trinity Washington University president Patricia McGuire argued that, [...] "the survey asks me to 'rate the academic quality of undergraduate programs,' assigning each school a single score using a 1-to-5 scale from 'marginal' to 'distinguished.' That I have little real information about these 181 institutions does not seem to matter to the U.S. News editors [...] Some of the actual best colleges in this nation do not fare well in the U.S. News survey because {{they do not have the}} wealth, big-time sports notoriety or public relations clout to influence the peer voting system." [...] Finally, DePauw University president, Robert G. Bottoms, argued that, [...] "I, in fact, did not fill out the reputational survey for this past year. [...] I came to the conclusion that I am not in a position to make judgments on other schools, many of which I have little or no familiarity with. The fact that one quarter of a college's ranking is based upon what is, in essence, its popularity, is very disturbing and we choose not to be a part of the process." ...|$|E
