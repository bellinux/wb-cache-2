5|$|Simple filters. The {{frequency}} dependence of electrical response {{was known for}} capacitors and inductors from very early on. The resonance phenomenon was also familiar from an early date and {{it was possible to}} produce simple, single-branch filters with these components. Although attempts were made in the 1880s to apply them to telegraphy, these designs proved inadequate for successful frequency-division multiplexing. Network analysis was not yet powerful enough to provide the theory for more complex filters and progress was further hampered by a general failure to understand the <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> nature of signals.|$|E
5|$|Carson and Zobel in 1923 had {{conclusively}} {{shown that}} filtering cannot remove noise {{to the same}} degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random noise in the <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of Fourier analysis to describe random noise and hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call band-limited white noise. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white noise and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.|$|E

25|$|Thus, using just {{truncation}} in {{the time}} domain, or equivalently low-pass filters in the <b>frequency</b> <b>domain,</b> one can cut out any convex set in time–frequency space; just using time domain or <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> methods without fractional Fourier transforms only allow cutting out rectangles parallel to the axes.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{interpretation}} of the Fourier transform is as a transformation of a time domain signal into a <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> signal. On the other hand, the {{interpretation of}} the inverse Fourier transform is as a transformation of a <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> signal into a time domain signal. Apparently, fractional Fourier transforms can transform a signal (either in the time domain or <b>frequency</b> <b>domain)</b> into the domain between time and frequency: it is a rotation in the time-frequency domain. This perspective is generalized by the linear canonical transformation, which generalizes the fractional Fourier transform and allows linear transforms of the time-frequency domain other than rotation.|$|E

25|$|The Fourier {{transform}} (FT) decomposes {{a function}} of time (a signal) into the frequencies that make it up, in a way similar to how a musical chord can be expressed as the frequencies (or pitches) of its constituent notes. The Fourier transform of {{a function of}} time itself is a complex-valued function of frequency, whose absolute value represents the amount of that frequency present in the original function, and whose complex argument is the phase offset of the basic sinusoid in that frequency. The Fourier transform is called the <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> representation of the original signal. The term Fourier transform refers to both the <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> representation and the mathematical operation that associates the <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> representation to a function of time. The Fourier transform {{is not limited to}} functions of time, but {{in order to have a}} unified language, the domain of the original function is commonly referred to as the time domain. For many functions of practical interest, one can define an operation that reverses this: the inverse Fourier transformation, also called Fourier synthesis, of a <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> representation combines the contributions of all the different frequencies to recover the original function of time.|$|E

The aim of our study was the comparative analysis of the parameters of cardiac remodeling and neurohumoral mechanisms of heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with essential arterial hypertension. 100 patients with essential arterial hypertension were included in the study. All patients went through heart rate variability parameters and left ventricle characteristics evaluation. Time and <b>frequency</b> <b>domains</b> were decreased in patients with arterial hypertension. Excess sympathetic activation takes place, parasympathetic system is depressed and it shows pathogenetic basis of disadaptation. Left ventricle hypertrophy is associated with progressive decrease of HRV and its circadian fluctuations.

40|$|Hanle {{scattering}} is {{an important}} diagnostic tool to study weak solar magnetic fields. Partial frequency redistribution (PRD) is necessary to interpret the linear polarization observed in strong resonance lines. Usually angle-averaged PRD functions are used to analyze linear polarization. However it is established that angle-dependent PRD functions are often necessary to interpret polarization profiles formed {{in the presence of}} weak magnetic fields. Our aim is to present an efficient decomposition technique, and the numerical method to solve the concerned angle-dependent line transfer problem. Together with the standard Stokes decomposition technique we employ Fourier expansion over the outgoing azimuth angle to express in a more convenient form, the angle-dependent PRD function for the Hanle effect. It allows the use of angle-dependent <b>frequency</b> <b>domains</b> of Bommier to solve the Hanle transfer problem. Such an approach is self-consistent and accurate compared to a recent approach where angle-averaged <b>frequency</b> <b>domains</b> were used to solve the same problem. We show {{that it is necessary to}} incorporate angle-dependent <b>frequency</b> <b>domains</b> instead of angle-averaged <b>frequency</b> <b>domains</b> to solve the Hanle transfer problem accurately, especially for the Stokes U parameter. The importance of using angle-dependent domains has been highlighted by taking the example of Hanle effect in the case of line transfer with vertical magnetic fields in a slab atmosphere. We have also studied the case of polarized line formation when micro-turbulent magnetic fields are present. The difference between angle-averaged and angle-dependent solutions is enhanced by the presence of micro-turbulent fields. Comment: 18 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
