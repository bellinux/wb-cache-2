Despite her injury, {{she was one of}} three Portland players in the program's history, including Tiffeny Milbrett and Shannon MacMillan, to score 25 goals and 15 assists in 2 seasons. In 2007, Rapinoe suffered her second season-ending ACL injury two games <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b> She was granted a medical hardship waiver by the NCAA, but did not use it.|$|E
5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert William M.

Prior to and during the 2005 season, Gray issued four forecasts, each time increasing the predicted level of activity. The NOAA issued two forecasts, one shortly before the season and one two months <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> drastically increasing the predicted level of activity in the second release. Nonetheless, all forecasts fell {{far short of the}} actual activity of the season.|$|E

Despite holding a significant advantage in time of possession, they lost 17–13, for their third loss in four games. To compound New York's problems, Phil Simms went down with an injury that would sideline him {{for the rest of}} the year. His replacement, Jeff Hostetler, was an unproven career backup, who had thrown a mere 68 passes coming <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Alabama Crimson Tide {{entered the}} 1998 college {{football}} season after a 1997 season {{that included a}} 47 and no bowl game.

Most voters expected Alabama to show little improvement over its performance in the previous year.|$|E
5|$|The Giants rallied {{and won the}} {{following}} week against the Minnesota Vikings before facing the Buffalo Bills in their regular season home finale. Despite holding the Bills' powerful offense to 17 points, the Giants lost 17–13, for their third loss in four games.

5|$|A {{couple of}} months <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the condition was initially treated with injections, but surgery was eventually required as a lasting solution, though it would keep him out for an extended period. However, his recovery took longer than expected {{and it was not}} until the end of the season that Johnson was able to start running again, delaying any comeback until at least the start of the 2006–07 season. That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the advice of his doctors, with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of Martin Foyle's second {{start to}} a season as York manager, six signings were {{made before the}} summer {{transfer}} window closed. With York 15th in the table 10 matches <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> Foyle resigned, and was succeeded by Tamworth's Gary Mills in October 2010. Under his guidance, York enjoyed an unbeaten run {{at home in the}} league that lasted until April 2011, when they were beaten by Mills' former team. York's push for a play-off place was ended late in the season and they finished eighth in the table. They reached the third round of the 2010–11 FA Cup, being beaten 2–0 away by Bolton Wanderers, and were knocked out {{in the first round of}} the 2010–11 FA Trophy after losing 1–0 at home to Boston United.|$|E
5|$|Although his new club {{began the}} 2001–02 season strongly, topping the First Division table and looking well placed for regaining the Premier League place that the club had last {{held in the}} 1997–98 season, Bruce {{tendered}} his resignation {{less than three months}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> in order to return to Birmingham City as manager. Although he was initially prevented from doing so by an injunction taken out by Crystal Palace, he was eventually allowed to join the Midlands-based club after a compensation package was agreed. By now he had acquired a reputation as a manager who rarely held down a job for a significant length of time.|$|E
5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> favored to win the {{national}} title. This was due in large part to Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting line up during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E

All the same, three months <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> he was the team's top scorer with six. As in the previous season, Hartlepools played Halifax Town in the FA Cup, and again, they won after a replay; Bonass was involved in three of their four goals, two of which were scored when his shot was parried to another player. He finished the season with 13 goals, second only to Wigham, as Hartlepools finished eighth in the Third Division.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Alabama came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> ranked No.2 in both preseason polls. The Crimson Tide {{won eight}} {{consecutive}} games {{to open the}} season before they lost to then No.1-ranked LSU 9–6 in overtime. Alabama then won its remaining games and finished the regular season with eleven wins and one loss (11–1) and secured their fourth consecutive ten-win season. The Crimson Tide then finished No.2 in the final BCS rankings over both Oklahoma State and Stanford {{to set up a}} rematch against LSU in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game. In the game, Alabama defeated LSU 21–0, allowed only 92 yards of total offense, and became the first team in BCS bowl history to shut out their opponent. The victory gave Alabama their 9th consensus national championship and Nick Saban became the only coach in college football to win three BCS Championships.|$|E

However, the next week, Alabama was upset by Johnny Manziel and the Texas A Aggies and dropped to the No.4 position.

The Crimson Tide then defeated the Bulldogs and captured the SEC Championship. The next day, Alabama finished No.2 in the final BCS rankings and would play Notre Dame in the 2013 BCS National Championship Game.
