5|$|Barr {{reflected}} on the campaign {{in an interview with}} Reason shortly after the election. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> his campaign's inability to gain access to donor lists hindered the campaign's fundraising capacity. In April 2009, he commented that his exclusion from the presidential debates prevented his campaign from gaining significant traction. Barr has stated that he will not run for public office in the future.|$|E
5|$|Following the Capitol shooting, Weston was {{transferred}} to a psychiatric center at Butner Federal Correctional Institution in Butner, North Carolina. In {{an interview with a}} court-appointed psychiatrist <b>he</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> he stormed the Capitol to prevent the United States from being annihilated by disease and legions of cannibals.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap, Chambers revealed he would depart the serial {{at the conclusion of}} his contract in late 2017 due to a prior commitment. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> he would be touring with a musical, which disappointed show bosses, but would return to the show {{at the conclusion of the}} tour.|$|E

25|$|Lycidas recites how sad he {{is without}} Phyllis, and how happy {{he will be}} if she returns to him. <b>He</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is {{superior}} to Mopsus in musical skill, looks and wealth. <b>He</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> cannot work without Phyllis. <b>He</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that,</b> if Phyllis is afraid that he might beat her, he shall have his hands bound (and reminds her {{of a time when}} Mopsus' own hands were bound, after he was caught thieving). He tells of the gifts of flowers he used to bring to Phyllis, and further mocks Mopsus. He threatens to hang himself if Phyllis does not return to him, and that a poem will be inscribed upon the tree from which he is hanged, telling of the affair.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, when the Hayden Planetarium was {{undergoing}} a $100 million renovation, Tyson refused {{to refer to}} Pluto as the ninth planet at the planetarium. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> he would rather group planets according to their commonalities rather than counting them. This decision resulted in Tyson receiving large amounts of hate mail, primarily from children. In 2009, Tyson wrote a book detailing the demotion of Pluto.|$|E
5|$|Tristano {{declined}} {{offers to}} perform in the 1970s; <b>he</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> {{he did not like}} to travel, and that the requirement for a career-minded musician to play concerts was not something that he wanted to follow. He continued teaching, and helped to organize concerts for some of his students. Another album, Descent into the Maelstrom, was released in the 1970s; it consisted of recordings made between 1951 and 1966.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{was asked}} to write an essay for the layman {{describing}} what mathematics is, and produced a beautiful analysis. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> mathematics straddles the world between the empirical and logical, arguing that geometry was originally empirical, but Euclid constructed a logical, deductive theory. However, he argued, that {{there is always the}} danger of straying too far from the real world and becoming irrelevant sophistry.|$|E
50|$|To {{prove his}} point <b>he</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has {{translated}} a debate {{between the two}} best Attic orators, Aeschines and Demosthenes.|$|R
5000|$|First, <b>he</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> {{such power}} vested {{in a single}} man would make him sway to {{personal}} inclinations and attachments. [...] Thus, {{this was not the}} best option. [...] Second, <b>he</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> power vested in an assembly would make the group prone to compromise, where one's personal inclination for one appointment would lead him to compromise on another in the hope that others will do the same for his. [...] Again, this would not work very well.|$|R
50|$|However, {{it becomes}} {{apparent}} that the boulder they are under is actually the ship, the Heart of Gold, and Zaphod Beeblebrox comes out of it, rather the worse for wear. <b>He</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has been put in the Total Perspective Vortex, and survived. After this, he celebrated and is hungover from a week's celebration. <b>He</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> the towel had been fossilised, and when the Earth was blown up two million years later, the Improbability Drive picked it up.|$|R
5|$|Bose {{commented that}} Ganguly's {{greatest}} legacy {{lay in his}} influence on the younger and budding generation of cricketers. Ganguly felt that every young player should play two years of domestic cricket before being selected for international assignments. He also said that every newcomer should be given at least five games to prove himself. Later <b>he</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> being at {{the receiving end of}} an unfair decision against him, that threatened to ruin his international cricket career, it enabled him to understand the insecurities of other newcomers in the team better than his predecessors. Ganguly had always backed the influence and contribution of younger players of the team.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{circumstances}} of the separation, Holopainen's appreciation of Turunen as an artist remained. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> he did not search for a similarly trained singer as a successor for Turunen because he considers her to be extraordinarily good in her genre and therefore irreplaceable. Turunen {{said in an interview that}} she is very proud of her career with Nightwish. She considers the remaining band members extremely talented and wishes all the best for them and their subsequent lead singer Anette Olzon.|$|E
5|$|In February 1998, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ricardo Torres {{dismissed}} Coppola's claim. Although Torres {{agreed that}} Sagan violated some {{terms of the}} contract, <b>he</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> Coppola waited too long to file his lawsuit, and that the contract might not be enforceable as it was written. Coppola then appealed his suit, {{taking it to the}} California Courts of Appeal (CCA). In April 2000, the CCA dismissed his suit, finding that Coppola’s claims were barred because they were brought too late. The court noted that it was not until 1994 that the filmmaker thought about suing over Contact.|$|E
50|$|Completing his story, Hanshirō <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> his sole {{desire is}} to join Motome, Miho, and Kingo {{in the next}} world. <b>He</b> <b>explains,</b> however, <b>that</b> they {{have every right to}} ask whether justice has been exacted for their deaths. Therefore, Hanshiro asks Saito if he has any {{statement}} of regret to convey to Motome, Miho, and Kingo. <b>He</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that,</b> if Saito does so, he will die without saying another word.|$|R

5|$|In a 1979 {{interview}} in The Videophile newsletter, Muntz revealed {{the biggest problem}} for the Stereo-Pak business was returned merchandise. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> when reproducing the work of major artists like The Beatles, the Stereo-Pak plant had to make {{hundreds of thousands of}} cartridges. But once a popular album became less popular, retailers would return the unsold cartridges, expecting credit towards new titles. Muntz was unprepared for the returns and said the huge cost of unsold merchandise eventually made his Stereo-Pak business unprofitable.|$|E
5|$|Kojima {{commented that}} the outside {{environment}} {{was very difficult to}} create. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> the reason previous games were primarily set indoors is because the current consoles were not powerful enough to portray a true jungle environment. In contrast with urban environments, the jungle does not have a flat surface. The protagonist in Snake Eater has to cross uneven terrain, including rocks, dirt mounds, and treestumps. As a result, the collision engine used in previous installments could not be used, and a new one had to be built from scratch. Setting up the motion capture technology so players could walk over these mounds was a problem during development.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2009, Randazza {{was interviewed}} {{about the case}} on the WPRR radio program, Declaring Independence. He {{explained}} why Beck did not file a libel lawsuit in the United States. He pointed out that because Beck was a public figure he had to prove a legal standard referred to as actual malice, and show that Eiland-Hall knew his assertions were inaccurate. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> this {{did not apply to}} Eiland-Hall's website even if it was knowingly inaccurate, because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell that no proof is needed for an absurd statement made in the context of satire.|$|E

5|$|Periyar {{claimed that}} Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada {{came from the}} same mother {{language}} of Old Tamil. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> the Tamil language is called by four different names since it is spoken in four different Dravidian states. Nevertheless, current understanding of Dravidian languages contains statements contradicting such claims. For example, the currently known classification of Dravidian languages provides the following distinct classes: Southern (including Tamil–Kannada (Malayalam) and Tulu); Central (including Telugu–Kui and Kolami–Parji); and, Northern (including Kurukh–Malto and Brahui). Additionally, statements on the presence of evidence for linking Dravidian languages and Indo-European languages are available.|$|E
5|$|Periyar viewed Christianity {{similar to}} the monotheistic faith of Islam. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> their faith says {{that there can be}} only one God which has no name or shape. Periyar took an {{interest}} in Rev. Martin Luther, where both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer. Thus, Christian views such as that of Ram Mohan Roy's The Precepts of Jesus has had at least an indirect influence on Periyar.|$|E
5|$|Smith gave an {{interview}} to the Columbia newspaper The State about his book and his interest in researching {{the history of the}} Central Intelligence Agency. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> he was long interested in researching military history, and was initially asked by the American Society of Journalists and Authors to put together a monograph on the 1944 Invasion of Normandy by Western Allied forces during Operation Overlord in World War II. His literary representative later telephoned him to ask if he would instead be interested in writing an encyclopedia detailing the history of the CIA. Smith agreed as he felt the CIA was highly relevant to military history.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) reluctantly {{responds}} to Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) call on Christmas Eve {{to investigate a}} haunted house in Maryland. <b>He</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> during Christmas of 1917, a young couple {{living in the house}} agreed to a lovers' pact, one killing the other and the remaining one committing suicide. <b>He</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> they could not stand the thought of being alone after the other died and during the afterlife; they wanted to spend all eternity together. Now, Mulder claims, they haunt the house every Christmas Eve.|$|R

5|$|The {{day after}} being fired, Savage apologized {{on his radio}} program and on his website. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> he {{believed}} that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller {{and that he was}} off the air {{at the time of the}} offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, on 17 November 2009, Näslund {{announced he}} {{was coming out of}} retirement to join Forsberg with Modo {{for the remainder of the}} 2009–10 Elitserien season. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> while he did not miss playing, both he and Forsberg desired to help their former club out of financial troubles and a last-place standing in the league, facing potential relegation. The announcement crashed the Modo web server as a result of the heavy volume of people visiting the site. As a board member of the club, Näslund said he and Forsberg would play without salary.|$|E
5|$|Alan Pattillo, a {{longtime}} scriptwriter and director for APF, was appointed the company's first official script editor in late 1964. This move was aimed {{to reduce the}} burden on Gerry Anderson who, while reserving his producer's right to overall creative control, had grown weary of revising scripts himself. Direction of episodes was assigned in pairs: veterans Pattillo and David Elliott alternated with the less-experienced Desmond Saunders and newcomer David Lane for each month's filming. Due to the difficulties of setting up takes, progress was slow: even on a productive day, it was rare for the crew to complete more than two minutes of puppet footage. In a contemporary interview, Hill noted that Thunderbirds contained several times as many shots as a typical live-action series. <b>He</b> <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> rapid editing was necessary {{on account of the}} characters' lack of facial expression, which made it difficult to sustain the viewer's interest {{for more than a few}} seconds per shot.|$|E

5000|$|Grab is {{not overly}} {{concerned}} with the impermanence of his work. He considers his work to have [...] "quite a bit of Zen or Buddhist overtones." [...] Beyond the balancing involved, Grab has aesthetic criteria as well. He is critical {{of some of his}} own output. <b>He</b> may <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> a piece feels too clumsy. Or <b>he</b> may <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "balance points" [...] are too large or the components themselves lack inherent interest. <b>He</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> a recent theme is [...] "to make it look as impossible as possible." [...] The time involved varies considerably from piece to piece, with some formations taking up to five hours to complete.|$|R
50|$|The {{powerful}} being {{known as}} the Watcher appears inside Reed's laboratory. <b>He</b> <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{is responsible for the}} atmospheric disturbances, for he has been attempting to conceal Earth's existence from the attention of the Silver Surfer. <b>He</b> further <b>explains</b> <b>that</b> the Surfer is the advance scout of Galactus, a powerful cosmic being that consumes the elemental energies of entire worlds, leaving them as little more than dried, lifeless husks.|$|R
