40|$|This study {{utilizes}} aircraft measurements obtained off the California {{coast to}} analyze the geometric, thermodynamic, and micro physical characteristics of convective updrafts and <b>down</b> <b>drafts</b> in the stratocumulus- topped boundary layer (BL). The vertical structure of thermodynamic and micro physical properties is consistent. The difference in peak droplet concentration between updrafts, <b>down</b> <b>drafts,</b> and the defined environment increases near the cloud top. We observe larger mean droplet diameters in <b>down</b> <b>drafts</b> near the cloud top, {{as the number of}} small droplets in cloud top <b>down</b> <b>drafts</b> appears to decrease. The horizontal variability seen in the cloud droplet spectra and micro physics properties is likely due to aerosol activation and growth in updrafts, cloud top entrainment, and penetrating cumulus. We compute the mass flux, using a mass flux parameterization. Several measured variables produce consistent results and agree with mass flux calculations from other stratocumulus datasets. U. S.

40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Electrical Engineering for the Degree of Master of Engineering in Energy TechnologyThe temperature variations of a biomass <b>down</b> <b>draft</b> batch feeding stove is analyzed. <b>Down</b> <b>draft</b> stoves are becoming more popular due to its low emission and high thermal efficiency. The principle of operation of the stove, in contrast to conventional designs is that the flow of air {{is in the same}} direction as the volatiles and fuel. Temperature distribution of the stove is important, because it has a direct relation with batch feeding. To explore the capability of using <b>down</b> <b>draft</b> stoves for other than cooking is very important and for that the temperature variation inside the stove has to be analyzed. A 150 mm X 150 mm grate size biomass stove is used and the chimney height is 1. 5 m. Diameter of the chimney is 88 mm and the average of 750 g of wood can be feed for a batch. Heat exchanger is used to extract heat form the chimney and the used air flow rate through the heat exchanger is 45 cm 7 S. The thermocouples are placed under the grate in-between grate and under the chimney inlet and on top of chimney outlet. And the temperature readings were plotted against time. Maximum temperature of 800 C is recorded in-between chimney and grate. And the all the temperatures shows an oscillation behavior, showing maximum Temperature during the middle of the feeding cycle and decreasing gradually...|$|R

Right {{from the start}} of production in 1971 for the Series 3 E-Type, the V12 engine had Lucas OPUS electronic ignition. This system was used until 1982 when the Lucas CEI system was introduced. Initially the OPUS ignition amplifier unit was secured directly to the engine between the cylinder heads and had problems due to overheating. Later cars had the ignition amplifier moved away from the engine where it could get air flow for cooling. Originally the V12 was supposed to get an advanced fuel injection system under development by AE Brico but this plan was cancelled at a late stage, possibly due to concerns that the design was too similar to Bosch products. The V12 as used in the Series 3 E-Types, Series 1 XJ12 and early Series 2 XJ12s (1973-April 1975) had four Zenith-Stromberg side <b>draft</b> <b>carburettors.</b> After April 1975, the V12 engine used in the S2 XJ12 and the new XJS had a Lucas fuel injection system which was based around the Bosch D-Jetronic system.|$|R

40|$|AbstractNow a day Briquetting {{of biomass}} {{material}} is significantly used in bio mass gasifier. It over come various {{problems in the}} production of producer gas in <b>down</b> <b>draft</b> gasifier in terms of quality, smoke reduction, higher thermal efficiency and less tar content. An experimental study reveals that, briquetting of bio mass materials saw dust and cow dung having a ratio of 75 : 25 have significant heating value and performance in the <b>down</b> <b>draft</b> bio mass gasifier. Generally the <b>down</b> <b>draft</b> gasifier is being used in villages for power generation and rural electrification, where in different sizes of rural bio mass material being used. Even though the briquetting of saw dust and cow dung is best suitable for <b>down</b> <b>draft</b> gasifier the size of briquette plays vital role on its effectiveness in gasification process. This paper deals the performance analysis about the briquetting bio mass material, ie. Saw dust and cow dung with 75 : 25 ratio for optimum gasification performance and deals with optimum size of briquette which yield higher heating value in gasification. This experiment was carried out with briquetting of Binder bio mass material ie. Cow dung with saw dust is experimentally investigated at 800 °C using gasification technique in a downdraft gasifier with different cylindrical type briquette sizes with internal dia. 10 mm and external dia. 40 mm and height varies from 40 mm, 50 mm and 60 mm. The air flow rate and pressure drop across the gasifier is calculated. The percentage of combustible gases like H 2, CO, CH 4, CO 2, and N 2 formed during gasification are found. The thermal efficiency and calorific value of the producer gas for different sizes of briquetting biomass material was calculated. Experimental results indicate that briquetting at 75 : 25 ratio of sawdust and cow dung with size (40 mm x 60 mm) is the best suitable biomass Briquette for gasifier compared to the other two sizes considered. The result shows that the gas composition of methane is comparably high in this size (i. e. 40 mm x 60 mm) than other two sizes i. e. (40 mm x 50 mm) and (40 mm x 40 mm). Also found that, thermal efficiency and calorific value is comparatively high at 40 mm x 60 mm size of briquette than other two sizes and it increases with air flow rate...|$|R

50|$|Virga {{can cause}} varying weather effects, because as rain is changed from liquid to vapor form, it removes {{heat from the}} air due to the high heat of {{vaporization}} of water. Precipitation falling into these cooling <b>down</b> <b>drafts</b> may eventually reach the ground. In some instances, these pockets of colder air can descend rapidly, creating a wet or dry microburst which can be extremely hazardous to aviation. Conversely, precipitation evaporating at high altitude can compressionally heat as it falls, and result in a gusty downburst which may substantially and rapidly warm the surface temperature. This fairly rare phenomenon, a heat burst, also tends to be of exceedingly dry air.|$|R

The nose pitched up so high that the pilot reacted by using full nose-down trim on the horizontal stabilizer (HS), while simultaneously pushing the elevators to the full down position. Then, an equally powerful <b>down</b> <b>draft</b> hit the plane and it went straight down in a matter of seconds. The pilot then pulled back on the yoke, moving the elevators to the full up position.

5000|$|Typically, {{residential}} and industrial evaporative coolers use direct evaporation, {{and can be}} described as an enclosed metal or plastic box with vented sides. Air is moved by a centrifugal fan or blower, (usually driven by an electric motor with pulleys known as [...] "sheaves" [...] in HVAC terminology, or a direct-driven axial fan), and a water pump is used to wet the evaporative cooling pads. The cooling units can be mounted on the roof (<b>down</b> <b>draft,</b> or downflow), or exterior walls or windows (side draft, or horizontal flow) of buildings. To cool, the fan draws ambient air through vents on the unit's sides and through the damp pads. Heat in the air evaporates water from the pads which are constantly re-dampened to continue the cooling process. Then cooled, moist air is delivered into the building via a vent in the roof or wall.|$|R
