5|$|This kid was a {{conservative}} {{when he was}} 17 years old. An archconservative Catholic. He {{could have been a}} member of the Curia. He was the top student in the class. He was brilliant, way above <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
5|$|I hemmed and hawed {{about it}} for a while because just for that reason though. Everybody wants to do the theme song of a James Bond movie, and I never liked to do what <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> likes to do. It's just some perverse thing in me, right? So, but then I thought about it and I said, you know what? James Bond needs to get – needs to get techno so...|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{arrangement of}} the amphitheatre represented the order of Roman society: the emperor presiding in his opulent box; senators and equestrians watching from the advantageous seats reserved for them; women seated at a remove from the action; slaves given the worst places, and <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> packed in-between. The crowd could call for an outcome by booing or cheering, but the emperor had the final say. Spectacles could quickly become sites {{of social and political}} protest, and emperors sometimes had to deploy force to put down crowd unrest, most notoriously at the Nika riots in the year 532, when troops under Justinian slaughtered thousands.|$|E
5000|$|In Coupland's 1995 novel Microserfs, {{the narrator}} says about his girlfriend: [...] "All she'll say {{is they are}} psychotic, as if <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> family isn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I tell you--a {{little thing}} like this--it remains tied tight round {{something}} inside me, reminding me for hours--well, what <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> opinion of me is.' ...|$|R
60|$|On the contrary, by some {{peculiar}} {{course of}} reasoning, he had convinced himself that whenever {{he lost a}} thing it was <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> fault in the house but his own.|$|R
5|$|Ale can be {{defeated}} by zmajeviti men, {{who have a}} human mother, but a dragon father. They look like ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits; such men are always born at night after a twelve-month term. Much like a zduhać, a zmajeviti man lives like <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> {{when the weather is}} nice, but when an ala leads threatening clouds into sight, he falls into a trance and his spirit comes out of his body and flies up to the clouds to fight with the ala, just like a dragon would do. A story from Banat, which was held as true until the 1950s, says that before World War I, an exhausted ala {{in the form of a}} giant snake fell from the clouds onto a road. The explanation of the event was that the ala was defeated in her fight with a zmajeviti man; people gave her milk to help her recover.|$|E
5|$|Andy (Ed Helms) {{still has}} not learned about fiancee Angela's (Angela Kinsey) affair with Dwight (Rainn Wilson), {{seventeen}} days after Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) revealed it to {{everyone else in the}} Dunder Mifflin office. Michael (Steve Carell) suggests he should inform Andy, but the entire office argues that Angela should be the one to break the news. Jim (John Krasinski) is particularly concerned that Andy's past anger management issues may lead to violence. Dwight tries convincing Angela to tell Andy, but she continues to put it off. This leaves Michael to tell Andy before he leaves for a meeting with David Wallace (Andy Buckley). Michael reveals the affair to Andy while driving out of the parking lot, leaving Andy shocked and dismayed. Angela reluctantly confirms the affair occurred, and Andy realizes <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> in the office already knew about it.|$|E
5|$|On 18 September 1961 Hammarskjöld flew to Ndola, {{just across}} the border in Northern Rhodesia, to attempt to broker a {{cease-fire}} between UN and Katangese forces. His aircraft crashed before landing at Ndola Airport, killing him and <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> on board. In stark contrast to Hammarskjöld's attempts to pursue a moderate policy in the Congo, his successor U Thant supported a more radical policy of direct involvement in the conflict. Katanga released the captured Irish soldiers in mid-October as part of a cease-fire deal in which ONUC agreed to pull its troops back—a propaganda coup for Tshombe. Restated American support for the UN mission, and the murder of ten Italian UN pilots in Port-Émpain in November 1961, strengthened international demands to resolve the situation. In December 1961, South Kasai was finally overrun by ANC troops and Kalonji was arrested, ending the South Kasai secession.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And I,' said Gerald grimly, 'shouldn't {{like to be}} in a {{world of}} people who acted {{individually}} and spontaneously, as you call it. We should have <b>everybody</b> cutting <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> throat in five minutes.' ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{talking about}} [...] "Animal Farm", Ray Davies said, [...] "This {{was just me}} {{thinking}} <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> mad {{and we are all}} animals anyway - which is really the idea of the whole album." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's our way here," [...] said Mr. Narrowpath {{with a wave}} of his hand. [...] "Every man's business, as we see it, is <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> business. Come along, you'll be {{surprised}} how quickly your business will be done." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{elements}} of the episode involving Kyle's loneliness as a Jew during Christmas were inspired by Parker and Stone's perceptions of Jews growing up in Colorado during their childhood. Although the two went to different schools, they both witnessed Jewish children get beat up and bullied because both of their schools had very few Jewish students to begin with; although Stone himself is Jewish, he was not raised as a practicing Jew {{and so he did}} not experience much of the bullying himself firsthand. The unsuccessful efforts by the South Park Elementary School in the episode to include people of non-Christian denomination were inspired by similarly failed attempts Parker and Stone witnessed growing up. Parker cited as an example a chorus concert in which the single Jewish student was asked to sing her own Hanukkah song while <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> sang Christmas songs; although the idea was to make the student feel special, Parker said it only made her feel more lonely and isolated.|$|E
5|$|Marge, Reverend Lovejoy and Ned attempt {{without success}} to bring Homer {{back to the}} congregation. One Sunday morning, while <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> is at church, Homer falls {{asleep on the couch}} smoking a cigar, which ignites some {{magazines}} and ultimately sets the whole house ablaze. Homer wakes up but quickly succumbs to the thick smoke and faints. Apu, chief of Springfield's volunteer fire department, rushes to the Simpson house with other firefighters including Krusty the Clown, Chief Wiggum, and Barney. Meanwhile, Ned runs into the burning house to rescue Homer and pulls him out just as the firefighters arrive. After the fire is out, Homer declares that God was delivering vengeance. Reverend Lovejoy counters that God was working through the hearts of Homer's friends, despite their different faiths. Homer agrees to give church another try and the next Sunday is there, albeit snoring loudly through the service. Appearing in his dreams again, God consoles Homer on the failure of his religion. He starts to tell Homer the meaning of life, but is cut off by the ending credits.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} promote inclusion, diversity, equality, respect and {{tolerance}} in a respectful work environment PwC the Netherlands launched GLEE: Gay Lesbian and <b>Everybody</b> <b>Else</b> network.|$|E
6000|$|... 'All in two months!' said Mr. Bumble, {{filled with}} dismal thoughts. 'Two months! No {{more than two}} months ago, I was not only my own master, but <b>everybody</b> <b>else's,</b> so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned, and now!--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Something {{that will}} rather {{surprise}} you, Basil: I {{have to tell}} you to leave London at once! Leave it for your own interests and for <b>everybody</b> <b>else's.</b> My father has found out that Clara has been to see you." ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{political}} views originated from {{his belief in}} the supreme importance of moral character. He rejected socio-political activism and sentimentalism as no substitute for individual conscience and character. He put stress on individual responsibility and opposed [...] "everybody's interference in <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> business." ...|$|R
25|$|There are {{two ways}} to do great mathematics. The first is to be smarter than <b>{{everybody}}</b> <b>else.</b> The second way is to be stupider than everybody else—but persistent.|$|E
25|$|Mary Millward, Eliza's elder sister, is a plain, quiet, {{sensible}} girl, housekeeper {{and family}} drudge. She is trusted and valued by her father, loved and courted by children and poor people, dogs and cats, and slighted and neglected by <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some severe driving {{offences}} will incur {{a strike}} on one's licence. This is logged {{in a central}} police database, and if one exceeds {{the maximum number of}} strikes, the licence is lost, but can ultimately be reacquired. The maximum number of strikes are two for those who've held their licence for fewer than three years, and three for <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tut, tut, Martha,' {{rejoined the}} locksmith; 'don't take offence at nothing. I mean, how strange {{it is of}} you to run down volunteering, when it's done to defend you {{and all the other}} women, and our own fireside and <b>everybody</b> <b>else's,</b> in case of need.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, quite {{disregarding}} Mrs. Hatherly, [...] "I am {{not going}} to give you any advice or instructions now you belong to me. After managing <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> affairs successfully for ever so long I made a deplorable mess of my own, you see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To make a {{necklace}} for playing Indian Chief," [...] explained Davy, climbing upon Anne's lap. [...] "He's got fifteen already, and <b>everybody's</b> <b>else's</b> promised, so there's no {{use in the}} rest of us starting to collect, too. I tell you the Boulters are great business people." ...|$|R
25|$|The British {{government}} {{was able to}} summon {{a large amount of}} public support, including the nationalist press, for the excesses committed on such communities. This is because the Criminal Tribes Act was posed widely as a social reform measure which reformed criminals through work. However, when they tried to make a living like <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> they did not find work outside the settlement because of public prejudice and ostracisation. The situation has continued to this day.|$|E
25|$|Growing up in {{southern}} California, Hill was asthmatic {{as a child}} and, as a result, missed several years of school.Despite the discomfort, it made you comfortable being alone with yourself. You weren't as surrounded by your peers as <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> your age was... In my case it meant tremendous amount of reading at an early age... I read, listened to radio... I became utterly besotted with daytime serials... it enabled me {{to live in an}} imaginary world where one is comfortable with abstract ideas, dominated by stories, narrative, and characters.|$|E
25|$|Molly Miles: Molly is the preteen {{daughter}} of Mr. and Mrs. Miles. Like <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> in her family, she has red or auburn hair and freckles. She {{is a big}} fan of Star Wars, Clint Eastwood, and movies in general. She has a best friend, Tyler, on whom she develops a crush as she got older, though he is unaware of her feelings. Molly is the one who has probably warmed the most towards Zoey, aside from her mom, and is trying to be the best big sister to her.|$|E
60|$|Rosa {{could only}} look apologetically {{sensible}} of being {{very much in}} her own way and in <b>everybody</b> <b>else’s.</b> Some passing idea of living, fireproof, up a good many stairs in Furnival’s Inn {{for the rest of her}} life, was the only thing in the nature of a plan that occurred to her.|$|R
60|$|Cecilia {{turned and}} saw a woman of middle height, with her hair done in the early Italian fashion, and very small, dark, lively eyes, which looked as though her love of living would keep her busy each minute of her day and all the minutes that she could occupy of <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> days.|$|R
5000|$|Dobbyn {{has noted}} the {{adoption}} of [...] "Loyal" [...] into the wider New Zealand psyche: [...] It's now got {{a life of its}} own. I never knew what that meant - New Zealand musician Neil Finnis always on about songs becoming <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> - and I never really felt that until that song. Dave Dobbyn ...|$|R
25|$|Bronx native Nancy Savoca's 1989 comedy, True Love, explores two Italian-American Bronx sweethearts in {{the days}} before their wedding. The film, which debuted Annabella Sciorra and Ron Eldard as the betrothed couple, won the Grand Jury Prize at that year's Sundance Film Festival. The CBS {{television}} sitcom Becker, 1998–2004, was more ambiguous. The show starred Ted Danson as Dr. John Becker, a doctor who operated a small practice and was constantly annoyed by his patients, co-workers, friends, and practically everything and <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> in his world. It showed his everyday life as a doctor working in a small clinic in the Bronx.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} stage, {{the rest of}} the cyclists (only 25 were still in race) took revenge on the Pélissier brothers. When they had to change bicycles, <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> sped away from them. Henri Pélissier chased the rest, but was then ordered by Desgrange to stop working {{together}} with other cyclists in his pursuit. In the end, Henri Pélissier had lost more than 35 minutes, and his brother Francis over three hours. The Pélissier brothers were angry at the organisation and left the race. Jean Alavoine won the stage, and Eugène Christophe became the new leader in the general classification.|$|E
25|$|Madame Patti has {{practically}} {{opened the}} Severn Tunnel… It {{is true that}} very few people knew it, and perhaps Madame Patti herself did not know it, but everybody {{will be talking about}} it to <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> The facts are these. On Sunday Madame Patti and party—a large one—wanted to get from London to Neath with comfort and speed. A special train was arranged for, and the great songstress paid for it out of her own pocket, or wherever she keeps the great piles of money she has made. Many people will be interested to know that the special train ran along the new route through the Severn Tunnel, and that the whole distance from Paddington to Neath was comfortably traversed in four hours and twelve minutes. This was the first through train from London to South Wales via Bristol and the Severn Tunnel, and Madame Patti chartered it, rode in it, and paid for it, and therefore she has the honour of having opened the Severn Tunnel route to London.|$|E
60|$|Farther. The {{power of}} choice is also a {{relative}} one. It depends not merely on our own estimate of the thing, but on <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> estimate; therefore on the number and force of {{the will of the}} concurrent buyers, and on the existing quantity of the thing in proportion to that number and force.|$|R
30|$|Apart {{from the}} {{advantage}} of visualizing the ideal process of PTA and stent placement, the interdisciplinary meeting assisted in stratifying common misconceptions and eradicating misunderstandings and miscommunications concerning steps carried out, especially by other staff involved in the process: By better understanding <b>everybody</b> <b>else’s</b> responsibilities in the process {{we were able to}} organize the process itself more efficiently.|$|R
50|$|Two {{nights before}} the festival gig, Talisman played in Stockholm. Because of a {{miscommunication}} between Jamie, Pontus, Marcel {{and the guys}} doing the mobile recording stuff, Marcel's entire gear (bass included!) was left at the venue in Stockholm instead of travelling with <b>everybody</b> <b>else’s</b> gear down to Sölvesborg, south of Sweden, where the Sweden Rock Festival takes place.|$|R
