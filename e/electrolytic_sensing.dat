The {{objective of this}} work {{is to create a}} new sensor for monitoring the concentration of exhaled CO 2 gas in human breath. Limitations such as high power, large size, lack of portability and undesirable use of sampling tubes are experienced currently during respiratory CO 2 monitoring. CO 2 being a very important biomarker, it is desirable to extend the scope of CO 2 monitoring beyond clinical use to home and ambulatory monitoring. Due to the vast amount of prior research effort put into currently used non-dispersive infra red (NDIR) CO 2 sensors, it was deemed unnecessary to further investigate this technique. The sensor development approach in this thesis has been creation of a solid-state CO 2 sensor through merging of state-of-the-art research in different disciplines - namely materials science, nanotechnology, chemistry, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. Early promise for development of such a sensor is shown by use of functionalized carbon nanotube (CNT) materials. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) functionalized with polyethylene imine (PEI) is used as the CO 2 sensitive material. A conductivity measurement technique using surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors enables measurement of SWNT conductivity with very high resolution. While sensitive to CO 2, this embodiment is several times more sensitive to humidity in the environment. Since humidity variation happens simultaneously with CO 2 variation in exhaled breath, this is found not to be a viable technique for respiratory CO 2 measurement. This early failure suggested a need for a sensor that was equally or more sensitive to CO 2 than to other environmental analytes. In looking for such an alternative sensor, a CO 2 sensor based on stiffness measurement of bare SWNTs was reported to be sensitive and selective to CO 2. However, current techniques used for film-stiffness measurement are too bulky, unreliable or expensive. Hence, a new stiffness sensing transducer is developed using an electret microphone. This stiffness measurement technique is based on the extreme sensitivity of an electret microphone's capacitance to the stiffness of its membrane. A CO 2 sensor is obtained by coating such a microphone with SWNTs. This embodiment shows good sensitivity to CO 2 but unpredictable response to humidity changes. While some microphones show excellent humidity resistance, others show large response to humidity. This behavior is traced to the fabrication of the microphones. Since commercial microphones are used in this work, {{it is not possible to}} control manufacturing specifications. Thus, practical difficulties with obtaining a reliable microphone are a major impediment. It was also judged that the sensitivity of stiffness changes to CO 2 might be insufficient for respiratory monitoring. The above two sensor embodiments suggest the difficulty in obtaining a selective yet sensitive solid-state CO 2 sensor using carbon nanotubes. Hence, an alternative approach is tested using sensitive, selective but slow commercial CO 2 sensors. CO 2 sensors made using an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>sensing</b> technique are commercially sold for indoor air-quality monitoring. While reliable, such sensors are too slow for respiratory monitoring. But, development of a (second order) mathematical model for the sensor's slow response enables detection of fast CO 2 changes during breathing. This is achieved by inverting the mathematical model to predict the fast CO 2 input based on the sensor's slow output. The resulting embodiment is the first reliable respiratory CO 2 sensor developed in this work. Though better than NDIR sensors, the power requirements and size of electrolytic CO 2 sensors are still unacceptable for portable and wireless respiratory CO 2 monitoring. Finally, based on research into CNTs and electrolytic CO 2 sensors, a new nanocomposite-material based CO 2 sensor is fabricated. This sensor combines advantages of high sensitivity and fast response of CNTs with the selectivity of metal carbonates to CO 2. The nanocomposite material is fabricated by attaching nanoparticles of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) to SWNTs. CO 2 sensing is achieved by measuring the resistance of the SWNT film which changes due to the reaction between CaCO 3 and CO 2. Cross-sensitivity to humidity, while present, is small enough to be removed using a reference CNT sensor that does not respond to CO 2 but responds to humidity. While reliable in operation, this sensor however suffers from slow response due to chemisorption of CO 2 on some of the CNTs. Since resistance of the entire nanocomposite can be controlled by a few CNTs, such slow-responding CNTs cause very poor overall response times (> 100 s). Model inversion techniques developed earlier are not effective with such response times to predict breath-by-breath CO 2 changes. In order to enhance the response time, a capacitance based sensor is developed using a similar nanocomposite (SWNT-BaCO 3). This sensor's speed of response is found to be much better compared to the previous embodiment which results in the development of a low-power, small, fast and inexpensive CO 2 sensor. However, the sensor's capacitance is still found to be sensitive to environmental humidity. Further, the developed nanocomposites are also found to require humidity in the environment for sensing CO 2. Thus, the sensor needs constant humidity to respond to CO 2 reliably during breath sensing. This is achieved by completely removing humidity from the exhaled breath (using a molecular sieve) before it reaches the sensor. Simultaneously, humid air sampled away from the face is supplied using a low-power pump to humidify the sensing chamber. Using these designs, a reliable respiratory CO 2 sensor is fabricated that is compared with a NDIR CO 2 analyzer. Results show that the sensor reliably monitors CO 2 concentration in the breath. The developed embodiment could potentially be improved with drift-correcting techniques (hardware and software); but is currently unique in its ability to perform low-power, portable and low-cost respiratory CO 2 sensing...|$|E

Copper oxides [...] both cuprous oxide, Cu 2 O, and cupric oxide, CuO [...] are abundant, environmentally friendly, and highly versatile. An attractive feature unique to both copper oxides is the ease of synthesis through a one-step thermal oxidation of copper foil in ambient environment, yielding various oxide compositions and morphologies according to the oxidation temperature and time. There are many possible applications for the copper oxide materials, including pigments in ceramics, catalysts, sensors, solar cells, and batteries, to name a few. This work presents applications in electrochemical cells, more specifically photocatalytic water splitting and CO 2 reduction, and gas sensors. The synthesis processes of copper oxides are characterized in terms of processing parameters and inspected with X-ray diffraction measurements and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Three kinds of copper oxides were investigated for photocatalytic testing: 1 micrometer-thick, and 5 micrometer-thick Cu 2 O films via 0. 5 hr and 10 hr oxidation at 300 °C, respectively, and a 10 micrometer-thick Cu 2 O film with 8 micrometer tall vertically-aligned CuO nanowire array on top via a 2 hr oxidation at 500 °C. Under AM 1. 5 illumination, photocurrents of 0. 8, 1. 3, and 1. 7 mA/cm 2, respectively, were recorded for these samples, exceeding the performance of previously reported as-synthesized, co-catalyst-free copper oxide photocathodes. Possible explanations for the observed performance based on increased minority carrier diffusion length and enhanced surface electric field are discussed. Future prospects of highly photoactive and stable copper oxide-based photocathodes are also explored. The effectiveness of surface passivation for the copper oxide photocathodes using pristine and hydrogenated TiO 2 thin films are quantified through prolonged photoelectrochemical testing. Photocathodes protected with TiO 2 films of 50 nm thickness deposited by atomic layer deposition exhibited excellent stability, but the photocurrent dropped to ~ 0. 06 mA/cm 2. The results of CO 2 reduction using electrochemically reduced Cu sites from copper oxide electrodes as precursors for CO 2 reduction is also demonstrated. The proportion of reaction products H 2, CO, HCOOH, and CH 3 COOH is shown to be tunable according to the surface morphology and composition of the original oxide electrode. Therefore, these electrodes exhibit the potential for highly selective liquid fuel production, including a measured H 2 /CO product ratio of ~ 2. 6 for maximized production of liquid fuels using the Fischer-Tropsch process. A simple gas sensing architecture taking advantage of the vertically-aligned growth of CuO nanowires is demonstrated. Complete devices are formed instantly following CuO nanowire synthesis by affixing a pair of electrode pads of a second substrate on top of the nanowire array to form a complete electrical circuit. This device architecture offers simple and facile integration of nanowires into a working device. A resistance change R/R 0 of ~ 6 was observed for 8. 1 % H 2 concentration increasing to ~ 26 for 25. 5 % H 2 concentration. Recovery time is excellent at ~ 0. 5 min or less. A description for the formation of facile microheater-integrated devices is outlined as a promising next step. A process flow to fabricate this device along with heat transfer analysis to predict the temperature distribution in the device is provided and the power consumption may be further minimized with a proposed pulsed heating strategy...|$|R
