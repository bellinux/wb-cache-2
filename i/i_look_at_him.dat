500|$|Steven Aoun of PopMatters {{applauded the}} way the episode [...] "focuses on two popular {{supporting}} characters, and foregrounds the relation between memory and identity." [...] Furthermore, the site noted that [...] "the sound that takes you by surprise may be your own crying." [...] Novelist Lev Grossman, {{in an interview with}} NPR, praised the backstory of the Ice King and the exploration of his condition, noting that his origin is [...] "psychologically plausible." [...] Grossman praised {{the way the}} series was able to tackle the issues of mental illness, saying: [...] "It's very affecting. My dad has been going through having Alzheimer's, and he's forgotten so much about who he used to be. And <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and think this cartoon is about my father dying." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 2016 MLS Cup Final against Seattle, held at BMO Field on 10 December, Giovinco's {{performance}} was largely stifled by Seattle's heavy and aggressive defending, despite initially creating an early goalscoring chance for Altidore; throughout the match, he was fouled {{a total of}} six times and had several shots blocked. A scoring opportunity came in the 48th minute, but his shot was skewed wide of the near post. He was eventually substituted for Tosaint Ricketts in the 103rd minute, due to an apparent injury, and consequently, despite being the club's main penalty kick taker, was not used in the resulting shoot-out, which Toronto lost 5–4, following a 0–0 draw after extra-time. Regarding Giovinco's surprising substitution, Toronto's coach, Greg Vanney, stated in the post-match press conference: [...] "He couldn't move. He looked at me. It's not like I take him off because I want to. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and he gives me the sign that he can’t go any more and when he feels like he can’t go, he feels like he’s more of a liability to the group than anything. That’s the decision. It's not one that I generally want to make, but we had to." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} that the punch was thrown {{by a member of}} Raekwon's entourage named Hanz. Hanz stated that he [...] "did not appreciate Budden speaking disrespectfully about Inspectah Deck and Method Man in interviews over the summer." [...] He further commented [...] "I punched him in the face because he was outta line. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> like, not the school yard bully, but the motherfucker that's always picking on a motherfucker that don't fuck with nobody. To say something about a nigga like Meth is crazy, Meth don't fuck with nobody. I'm not gonna sit here and say Rae made me do it, that was a spontaneous decision on my own. I'm glad I did it, 'cause he got a big mouth...It wasn't actually planned, he could have actually changed that whole situation as it unfolded, as it went on".|$|E

2500|$|The diaries {{have become}} famous {{mostly because of}} the {{frequent}} remarks on and criticisms of Churchill. Although the diaries contain passages expressing admiration of Churchill, they {{also served as a}} vent for Brooke's frustration with working with the Prime Minister. The diaries also give sharp opinions on several of the top Allied leaders. The American generals Eisenhower and Marshall, for example, are described as poor strategists and Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander as unintelligent. Among the few individuals of whom Brooke seems to have kept consistently positive opinions, from a military standpoint, were General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, Field Marshal Sir John Dill, and Joseph Stalin. Brooke admired Stalin for his quick brain and grasp of military strategy. Otherwise he had no illusions about the man, describing Stalin thus: [...] "He has got an unpleasantly cold, crafty, dead face, and whenever <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> I can imagine his sending off people to their doom without ever turning a hair." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1996, {{the long-running}} Somalia inquiry claimed a {{prominent}} victim when General Jean Boyle {{was forced to}} resign as Chief of the Defence Staff allowing allegations that he attempted to stymie the work of the inquiry and he had committed perjury when he testified before the inquiry about his role in the alleged Somalia cover-up of 1993. That same month, David Collenette, whose position was widely seen as untenable after Boyle's resignation given that he had personally selected Boyle, resigned as Defence Minister, ostensibly because of a minor violation of the ethics rules, to be replaced with Doug Young. Young frankly admitted in an interview in late 1996 he [...] "certainly wouldn't want to be in an election campaign with the inquiry still going on". In early 1997, Young ordered the inquiry to be shut down despite the complaints from the commissioners that their work was far from done. This marked the effective end of the Somalia Affair. Speaking about the shut-down of the inquiry, one of the commissioner Peter Desbarats said: [...] "The fact that Chrétien was willing to tamper with something like an independent inquiry for the sake of what appeared to be minuscule political advantage, I just thought, Wow, if he'll do that, he'll do anything." [...] Desbarats stated that he once been a fan of Chrétien, but the shut-down of the Somalia inquiry [...] "changed the way <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> totally".|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> blankly. <b>I</b> had {{forgotten}} all about Lord Porthoning.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in surprise. He {{repeated}} the movement--a grotesque one.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> curiously. A {{man does}} not often confess himself entirely friendless.|$|R
6000|$|... "Compeyson, {{he looks}} at me very noticing, and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He has a watch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a {{handsome}} suit of clothes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! He's {{a curious}} animal and seems remarkably small, now that <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> No {{one would think}} of biting such a little thing, except a coward like me," [...] {{continued}} the Lion sadly.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{a man of}} {{that kind}} ever came to be Laura Waynefleet's father is more than I can figure out!" [...] he said. [...] "It's a {{question}} that worries me every time <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Guess she owes everything to her mother; and Mrs. Waynefleet {{must have been a}} mighty patient woman." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> curiously. <b>I</b> {{had never}} {{understood}} his insistence on that point.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{singular}} question. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> quickly. His face was sphinxlike.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> again. Good is so overpoweringly frivolous. 'What is it?' I said.|$|R
6000|$|Tyrrel {{paused a}} moment again. His face was like marble. Then he added, {{in a tone of}} the profoundest anguish, [...] "Till this minute, Eustace, I've never told anybody. And if it hadn't been forced out of me by that poor man's {{tortured}} and broken-hearted face, I wouldn't have told you now. But could <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> to-day and not break down before him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I have {{no doubt}} of it, and he {{expected}} to play the same game with me. The fellow reminds me, whenever <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> of a sort of incarnate familiar demon. When I asked my uncle whether he could guess {{what had become of}} her, he held up his hands with a hideous French grimace. I could have taken him by the throat.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; and that, no doubt, is his {{argument}} {{when he sees}} me. He is delighted to have me down at Tretton, and, to tell the truth, I do not feel the slightest animosity toward him. But as <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> I think {{him to be the}} most remarkable old gentleman that the world has ever produced. He is quite unconscious that I have any ground of complaint against him." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> sideways. He {{was really}} a dear. Niceness fairly exhaled from him.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> In {{the popular}} phrase, I {{could hardly believe}} my own ears.|$|R
60|$|I {{dropped my}} glance, browbeaten for an instant. Then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> again, and smiled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes;--but {{they tell}} me the poor little dear will have forty {{thousand}} a year when he's of age; and when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in his little bed, and press him in my arms, and think of all that money, I almost wish {{that his father had}} been a poor plain gentleman." [...] Then the handkerchief was put to her eyes, and Lord Fawn had a moment in which to collect himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "The crows {{are very}} interesting. They flap past {{all the time}} we're out in the yard. The {{railways}} and the crows make the charm {{of my life in}} Brayford. The other day I saw no end of pairs of crows. Do you remember what they say at home?—'One for sorrow.' Very often one solitary creature sits on the telegraph wires. I almost hate him when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> I think my badge for life ought to be—one crow——." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{challenged}} her, and she {{quoted the}} Brabants, about whom {{there had been}} an ancient scandal. She'd heard of it from Altiora, and it was also Altiora who'd given her a horror of Lord Carnaby, who was also with us. [...] "You know his reputation," [...] said Margaret. [...] "That Normandy girl. Every one knows about it. I shiver when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He seems--oh! like something not of OUR civilisation. He WILL come and say little things to me." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{a little}} puzzled. His words {{had seemed to}} possess some special significance.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in surprise. He {{was waiting}} for my answer {{with an air of}} anxiety.|$|R
60|$|For {{the moment}} I forgot this man's {{kindness}} to me. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a shudder.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd never dare to," [...] {{said the}} dogman, awed at the bold proposition. [...] "He sleeps in the bed, I sleep on a lounge. He runs howling to Marcella if <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Some night, Jim, I'm {{going to get}} even with that dog. I've {{made up my mind}} to do it. I'm going to creep over with a knife and cut a hole in his {{mosquito}} bar so they can get in to him. See if I don't do it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|MARMADUKE [...] These drowsy shiverings, [...] This mortal stupor {{which is}} {{creeping}} over me, [...] What do they mean? were this my single body [...] Opposed to armies, not a nerve would tremble: [...] Why do I tremble now?--Is not the depth [...] Of this Man's crimes {{beyond the reach}} of thought?

6000|$|... 'Now, {{this is a}} very artful dog,' said Mr Boffin, with a deep look. 'This is a longer-headed schemer than I thought him. See how patiently and methodically he goes to work. He gets to {{know about}} me and my property, and about this young lady, and her share in poor young John's story, and he puts this and that together, and he says to himself, [...] "I'll get in with Boffin, and I'll get in with this young lady, and I'll work 'em both at the same time, and I'll bring my pigs to market somewhere." [...] I hear him say it, bless you! <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> now, and I see him say it!' ...|$|E
60|$|He sat, {{with that}} carved {{grin on his}} face, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the fire, as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|A man's figure {{suddenly}} {{appeared on the}} left. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> puzzled, wondering whence he had come.|$|R
