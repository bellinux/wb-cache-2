2500|$|In {{intensive}} broiler sheds, the air {{can become}} highly polluted with ammonia from the droppings. In {{this case a}} farmer must run more fans {{to bring in more}} clean fresh air. If not this can damage the chickens' eyes and respiratory systems and can cause painful burns on their legs (called hock burns) and blisters on their feet. Broilers bred for fast growth have a high rate of leg deformities because the large breast muscles causes distortions of the developing legs and pelvis, and the birds cannot support their increased body weight. In cases where the chickens become crippled and can't walk farmers have to go in and pull them out. Because they cannot move easily, the chickens are not able to adjust their environment to avoid heat, cold or dirt as they would in natural conditions. [...] The added weight and overcrowding also puts a strain on their hearts and lungs and Ascites can develop. In the UK, up to 19 million broilers die in their sheds from heart failure each year. In the case of no ventilation due to power failure during a heat wave 20,000 chicken can die {{in a short period of}} time. In a good grow out a farmer should sell between 92 and 96 percent of their flock.

30|$|These {{results are}} in {{accordance}} with the findings of Kim and Kang that reported the reduced growth rate of rockfish (Sebartes schlegeli) due to Cu stress and there was an inverse relationship between growth and Cu exposure (Kim and Kang 2004). Ali et al. (2003) observed reduced growth of Oreochromis niloticus under different (0, 0.5, 0.3, & 0.5  ppm) water-borne Cu levels (Ali et al. 2003). Also these {{results are in}} accordance with the findings of Mohanty et al. (2009) that determined the effect of copper on survival, growth and feed intake of Indian major carp, C mrigala for 60  days. They observed that feed intake in fish reduced significantly (P[*]<[*] 0.001) at all the Cu treatments. Significant difference was recorded in <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> of treated (0.65) and control (0.55) fish. The control fish exhibited significantly better (0.26) <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> than the treated fish (0.50) (Mohanty et al. 2009). Javed observed low <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> in major carps (C. catla, L. rohita & C. mrigala) due to exposure of these fish to water-borne zinc (Javed 2005).|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} research, {{laboratory}} studies {{were conducted with}} nine life stages of three fish species viz. Catla catla, Labeo rohita and Cirrhina mrigala to determine their feed intake, weight gains and <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> under sub-lethal chronic exposure of zinc toxicity. Zinc bioaccumulations in fish organs viz., gills, kidney, liver, skin, muscle and scales during chronic toxicity exposures, have also been determined. All the three fish species showed uniformity in their response towards feed intake, weight increment and <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> under sub-lethal zinc chronic exposures. Feed intake by all the three fish species increased significantly with metal exposure time. However, this significant increase in feed intake {{did not result in}} fish weight escalation and hence resulted in low <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios.</b> Sensitivity of the fish to zinc decreased with fish age also. Different fish age groups showed statistical differences for the accumulation of zinc in their bodies. However, the patterns of these accumulations varied significantly among fish organs. Fish liver and kidney exhibited significantly higher tendency for the accumulation of metals...|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} aspect of energy use of livestock production is the energy consumption that the animals contribute. <b>Feed</b> <b>Conversion</b> <b>Ratio</b> is an animal’s ability to covert feed into meat. The <b>Feed</b> <b>Conversion</b> <b>Ratio</b> (FCR) is calculated by the taking the energy, protein or mass input of the feed divided by the output of meat provided by the animal. A lower FCR corresponds with a smaller requirement of feed per meat out-put, therefore the animal contributes less GHG emissions. Chickens and pigs usually have a lower FCR compared to ruminants.|$|E

50|$|In farmed animals, {{gut health}} has an {{additional}} dimension, as a healthy gut enables more {{efficient use of}} feed, called the <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratio.</b> Over many decades antibiotic drugs {{have been added to}} the diet of farmed animals at non-therapeutic levels in the absence of disease, in order to enhance the <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratio,</b> accelerate growth and protect the animal's health, therefore increasing profitability for producers. Today, however, there is a global push to reduce the use of medically important antibiotics as feed additives for farm animals, due to concerns about this practice promoting the emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms. This trend has fueled interest in natural nutritional concepts. Based on a large body of research MOS has established itself as one of the more important natural additives in farm animal production. The effect of MOS on animal performance was analysed in several meta-analyses (statistical analyses of final reports from trials that essentially contain the same experimental treatments) for poultry, pigs, and calves. These analyses reported improvements in performance with MOS.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the ecological impact of crickets as a source of dietary protein is less than conventional forms of livestock due to their comparatively efficient feed conver-sion and ability to consume organic side-streams. This study measured the biomass output and <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> of house crickets (Acheta domesticus) reared on diets that var-ied in quality, ranging from grain-based to highly cellulosic diets. The measurements were made at a much greater population scale and density than any previously reported in the scientific literature. The biomass accumulation was strongly influenced by the quality of the diet (p< 0. 001), with the nitrogen (N) content, the ratio of N to acid detergent fiber (ADF) con-tent, and the crude fat (CF) content (y=N/ADF+CF) explaining most of the variability be-tween feed treatments (p = 0. 02; R 2 = 0. 96). In addition, for populations of crickets that were able to survive to a harvestable size, the <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> measured were higher (less efficient) than those reported from studies conducted at smaller scales and lower pop-ulation densities.

40|$|Bacterial {{disease can}} have {{significant}} impacts {{in the culture}} of yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi. Immunostimulants induce an immune response to better effectively fight off disease and have many advantages over the use of antibiotics. There are few commercially available immunostimulants for fish, with Actigen and Aquagard being two products which have shown potential. Recent studies on these two products have suggested they have the ability to increase survival and growth rates, and improve <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios,</b> as well as stimulate the immune system-shown by increased lysozyme activity, blood parameters and villus and mucous cell counts, which is what this study hypothesised. These immunostimulants, however, have never been tested in yellowtail kingfish. In this 16 -week study, these parameters were measured in yellowtail kingfish fed a commercial diet coated with Actigen or Aquaguard and compared against the same diet without any immunostimulants. Survival of fish in the Aquagard treated group was significantly higher than those fed the control diet and the Actigen diet following a natural infection of Photobacterium damselae and Vibrio harveryi. The growth rates, <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios,</b> blood parameters, lysozyme activity, villus height and mucous cell count did not significantly differ among the treatment groups.

A total number of 400 67 -day-old Japanese quails in lay, previously submitted to 14 days of forced molting, was distributed in a completely randomized experimental design into five treatments (T 1 = not submitted to forced molting, T 2 = 03 days of fasting + fed ad libitum, T 3 = 01 days of fasting + 13 days of feed restriction, T 4 = 02 days of fasting + 12 days of feed restriction, and T 5 = 03 days of fasting + 11 days of feed restriction. Feeds were contained equal nutrient levels, and were formulated according to NRC (1994) recommendations. There were significant differences among the studied treatments. Although the treatment of 3 days of fasting followed by ad libitum feeding resulted in lower egg weight, it promoted better lay percentage, egg mass, and <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> (FCR/dz and FCR/kg). on the other hand, 3 days of fasting followed by restricted feeding resulted in higher feed intake and worse <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>ratios</b> (FCR/dz and FCR/kg).
