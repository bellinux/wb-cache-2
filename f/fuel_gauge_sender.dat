50|$|There {{are four}} {{distinct}} electrical systems {{that may be}} used in autogas systems - <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>sender,</b> fuel shut-off, closed loop feedback mixture control and injection control.|$|E
50|$|In some installations, the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>sender</b> {{fitted to}} the autogas tank is matched to the {{original}} fuel gauge in the vehicle. In others, an additional gauge is added to display the level of fuel in the autogas tank separately from the existing petrol gauge.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gauge</b> <b>sender</b> {{is usually}} a magnetically coupled arrangement, with a float arm inside the tank {{rotating}} a magnet, which rotates an external gauge. The external gauge is usually readable directly, and most also incorporate an electronic sender to operate a <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> on the dashboard.|$|R

40|$|Chaotic {{system may}} lead to instability, extreme {{sensitivity}} and performance reduction in control systems. It is therefore {{important to understand the}} causes of such undesirable characteristics in control system especially in the automobile <b>fuel</b> <b>gauges.</b> This is because without accurate <b>fuel</b> <b>gauges</b> in automobile systems, it will be difficult if not impossible to embark on a journey whether during odd hours of the day or where fuel is difficult to obtain. To this end, this work studied the impacts of fuel tank rust and faulty component of <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> system (voltage stabilizer) on the chaotic characteristics of <b>fuel</b> <b>gauges.</b> The results obtained were analyzed using Graph iSOFT package. Over the range of experiments conducted, the results obtained showed that rust effect of the fuel tank would alter the flow density, consequently the fluid pressure and ultimately the flow velocity of the fuel. The responses of the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> pointer to the faulty voltage stabilizer were erratic causing noticeable instability of gauge measurands indicated. The experiment also showed that the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> performed optimally by indicating the highest degree of accuracy when combined the effect of rust free tank and non-faulty voltage stabilizer conditions (± 6. 75 % measurand error) as compared to only the rust free tank situation (± 15 % measurand error) and only the non-faulty voltage stabilizer condition (± 40 % measurand error). The study concludes that both the fuel tank rust and the faulty voltage stabilizer gauge component {{have a significant effect on}} the sensitivity of <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> and its accuracy ultimately. Also, by the reason of literature, our findings can also be said to be valid for all other fluid meters and gauges applicable in plant machineries and most hydraulic systems...|$|R

50|$|While the {{aircraft}} was {{being prepared for}} its return to Edmonton, a maintenance worker decided to investigate {{the problem with the}} faulty FQIS. To test the system he re-enabled the second channel, at which point the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauges</b> in the cockpit went blank. He was called away to perform a floatstick measurement of fuel remaining in the tanks. Distracted, he failed to disable the second channel, leaving the circuit breaker tagged (which masked {{the fact that it was}} no longer pulled). The FQIS was now completely unserviceable and the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauges</b> were blank.|$|R
5000|$|The Yamaha Libero G5 is a 106 cc, single-cylinder {{four-stroke}} motorcycle from India Yamaha Motor. Its predecessor {{was known}} as just Yamaha Libero. Unlike Libero G5, Libero had tachometer and round headlights but lacked <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge.</b> However, Libero G5 came with a sporty headlight and <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge,</b> but lacked the tachometer. A new set of air scoops with a honeycomb grille do dual duty; directing airflow over the engine block and also neatly covering {{the gap between the}} engine and the fuel tank. The Libero G5’s frame continues to be the tubular dual-cradle type.|$|R

The B2 instrument panel feature {{the speedometer and}} tachometer but the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> {{and most of the}} warning indicators were replaced with an LCD. The design change also changed the wiring harness and a number of electrical connectors {{in the front of the}} motorcycle changed. The speedometer on the B1 is electronic while the B2 is cable driven. The transducer appears to generate a pulse train that is converted to a voltage to feed the speedo meter.|$|R
