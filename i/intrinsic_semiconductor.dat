25|$|It is {{the most}} {{thermally}} stable binary silicon compound, only decomposing through loss of silicon starting from around 2700°C. It is resistant to most aqueous acids, phosphoric acid being an exception. It forms a protective layer of silicon dioxide {{on the surface and}} hence only oxidises appreciably in air above 1000°C; removal of this layer by molten hydroxides or carbonates leads to quick oxidation. Silicon carbide is rapidly attacked by chlorine gas, which forms SiCl4 and carbon at 100°C and SiCl4 and CCl4 at 1000°C. It is mostly used as an abrasive and a refractory materia, as it is chemically stable and very strong, and it fractures to form a very sharp cutting edge. It is also useful as an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>semiconductor,</b> as well as an extrinsic semiconductor upon being doped. In its diamond-like behaviour it serves as an illustration of the chemical similarity between carbon and silicon.|$|E
25|$|Pure monocrystalline silicon is used {{to produce}} silicon wafers used in the {{semiconductor}} industry, in electronics, and in some high-cost and high-efficiency photovoltaic applications. Pure silicon is an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>semiconductor,</b> which means that unlike metals, it conducts electron holes and electrons released from atoms by heat; silicon's electrical conductivity increases with higher temperatures. Pure silicon has too low a conductivity (i.e., too high a resistivity) {{to be used as}} a circuit element in electronics. In practice, pure silicon is doped with small concentrations of certain other elements, which greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by controlling the number and charge (positive or negative) of activated carriers. Such control is necessary for transistors, solar cells, semiconductor detectors, and other semiconductor devices used in the computer industry and other technical applications. In silicon photonics, silicon can be used as a continuous wave Raman laser medium to produce coherent light, though it is ineffective as an everyday light source.|$|E

50|$|Semiconductor doping is {{the process}} that changes an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>semiconductor</b> to an {{extrinsic}} semiconductor. During doping, impurity atoms are introduced to an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>semiconductor.</b> Impurity atoms are atoms of a different element than the atoms of the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>semiconductor.</b> Impurity atoms act as either donors or acceptors to the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>semiconductor,</b> changing the electron and hole concentrations of the semiconductor.

50|$|Extrinsic (doped) {{semiconductors}} have a {{far more}} complicated temperature profile. As temperature increases starting from absolute zero they first decrease steeply in resistance as the carriers leave the donors or acceptors. After most of the donors or acceptors have lost their carriers, the resistance starts to increase again slightly due to the reducing mobility of carriers (much as in a metal). At higher temperatures, they behave like <b>intrinsic</b> <b>semiconductors</b> as the carriers from the donors/acceptors become insignificant compared to the thermally generated carriers.|$|R
