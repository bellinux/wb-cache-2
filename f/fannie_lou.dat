5|$|After meeting <b>Fannie</b> <b>Lou</b> Hamer in {{the summer}} of 1964 and hearing her {{experiences}} in the civil rights movement, Blackwell decided to join the SNCC. As a project director for the SNCC, she organized voter registration drives across Mississippi. Later that year, she became a member on the executive committee of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), which provided a party for voters that SNCC had been registering to vote. In late August she and 67 other activists left Mississippi to represent the MFDP at the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in an attempt to get the MFDP seated as delegates. They were unsuccessful in getting seats, but the move brought the party and the Mississippi civil rights movement into the public eye.|$|E
25|$|Her {{husband died}} of throat cancer on August 19, 1977, and her brother, her only sibling, {{died of cancer}} that November. Her {{personal}} ordeals caused her to become removed from the civil rights movement. She learned from a newspaper {{of the death of}} <b>Fannie</b> <b>Lou</b> Hamer, once a close friend. Parks suffered two broken bones in a fall on an icy sidewalk, an injury which caused considerable and recurring pain. She decided to move with her mother into an apartment for senior citizens. There she nursed her mother Leona through the final stages of cancer and geriatric dementia until she died in 1979 at the age of 92.|$|E
25|$|At the 1964 Democratic National Convention, which {{followed}} Freedom Summer in Mississippi, Rustin became {{an adviser to}} the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP); they were trying to gain recognition as the legitimate, non-Jim Crow delegation from their state, where blacks had been officially disenfranchised {{since the turn of the}} century (as they were generally throughout the South) and excluded from the official political system. DNC leaders Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey offered only two non-voting seats to the MFDP, with the official seating going to the regular segregationist Mississippi delegation. Rustin, following a line set by Shachtman and AFL-CIO leaders, urged the MFDP to take the offer. MFDP leaders, including <b>Fannie</b> <b>Lou</b> Hamer and Bob Moses, angrily rejected the arrangement; many of their supporters became highly suspicious of Rustin. Rustin's attempt to compromise appealed to the Democratic Party leadership.|$|E
500|$|In 1963, Sunflower County {{resident}} and sharecropper <b>Fannie</b> <b>Lou</b> Hamer was jailed and beaten {{for attempting to}} register to vote. The next year, she led a massive voter registration drive in the Delta region, and volunteers worked on Freedom Summer throughout the state. Before 1954, 265 black people were registered to vote in three Delta counties, where they were {{a majority of the}} population. At this time, blacks [...] made up 41% of the total state population. The summer Emmett Till was killed, the number of registered voters in those three counties dropped to 90. By the end of 1955, fourteen Mississippi counties had no registered black voters. The Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964 registered 63,000 black voters in a simplified process administered by the project; they formed their own political party because they were closed out of the Democratic Regulars in Mississippi.|$|E
500|$|Mahalia Jackson's 1947 version {{received}} significant radio airplay, and as her popularity grew {{throughout the}} 1950s and 1960s, she often sang it at public {{events such as}} concerts at Carnegie Hall. Author James Basker states that the song has been employed by African Americans as the [...] "paradigmatic Negro spiritual" [...] because it expresses the joy felt at being delivered from slavery and worldly miseries. Anthony Heilbut, author of The Gospel Sound, states that the [...] "dangers, toils, and snares" [...] of Newton's words are a [...] "universal testimony" [...] of the African American experience. During the Civil Rights Movement and opposition to the Vietnam War, the song took on a political tone. Mahalia Jackson employed [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] for Civil Rights marchers, writing that she used it [...] "to give magical protection a charm to ward off danger, an incantation to the angels of heaven to descend... I was not sure the magic worked outside the church walls... {{in the open air}} of Mississippi. But I wasn't taking any chances." [...] Folk singer Judy Collins, who knew the song before she could remember learning it, witnessed <b>Fannie</b> <b>Lou</b> Hamer leading marchers in Mississippi in 1964, singing [...] "Amazing Grace". Collins also considered it a [...] of sorts, and saw its equal emotional impact on the marchers, witnesses, and law enforcement who opposed the civil rights demonstrators. According to fellow folk singer Joan Baez, {{it was one of the}} most requested songs from her audiences, but she never realized its origin as a hymn; by the time she was singing it in the 1960s she said it had [...] "developed a life of its own". It even made an appearance at the Woodstock Music Festival in 1969 during Arlo Guthrie's performance.|$|E

2500|$|On May 2, 2006, Representative Sensenbrenner {{introduced}} the <b>Fannie</b> <b>Lou</b> Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. The bill proposed {{to extend the}} special provisions by 25 years and keep the coverage formula unchanged. The bill also proposed to amend the Act to overturn two recent Supreme Court cases: Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board (2000), which interpreted Section 5 to prohibit voting changes that were enacted or maintained for a [...] "retrogressive" [...] purpose instead of any discriminatory purpose, and Georgia v. Ashcroft (2003), which established a broader test for determining whether a redistricting plan had an impermissible effect under Section 5 than assessing only whether a minority group could elect its preferred candidates. While passage of the bill was virtually certain, a few Republican lawmakers attempted to amend the bill on the House floor. One group of legislators, led by Congressman Lynn Westmoreland (R–GA), argued that the reauthorization unfairly targeted certain jurisdictions for long-past discrimination. Another group of 80 legislators signed a letter originated by Congressman Steve King (R–IA) arguing that the Act's bilingual election requirements constituted costly unfunded mandates. All proposed amendments to the bill failed, though three received {{the support of a}} majority of the Republican caucus. Following the defeat of these amendments, the House passed the bill on July 13, 2006 by a 390-33 vote. Notably, this tally included many Republicans who had previously voted in favor of the failed amendments.|$|E
