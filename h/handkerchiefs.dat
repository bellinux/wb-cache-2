5|$|Shedding one's clothes, Kutzer observes, is {{a symbol}} of {{shedding}} the social self and its constraints to then embrace the freedom of the animal self, but Lucie, who sets off for an adventure after shedding her pinafore and <b>handkerchiefs,</b> fails to embrace her animal self and learns nothing new about herself. True, she learns something about the animal world – hens shed their stockings and robins their red vests – but Lucie began her adventure as a well-behaved, proper young Victorian child and remains so at tale's end, taking delight in the goffered pinafore and the laundered <b>handkerchiefs</b> that confine and define such a child. Having not learned something new about herself, Lucie's success as a literary heroine is moot.|$|E
5|$|That night Halverson, his copilot, and his {{engineer}} pooled their candy rations for {{the next}} day's drop. The accumulated candy was heavy, {{so in order to}} ensure the children were not hurt by the falling candy, Halvorsen made three parachutes out of <b>handkerchiefs</b> and tied them to the rations. In the morning when Halverson and his crew made regular supply drops, they also dropped three boxes of candy attached to <b>handkerchiefs.</b> They made these drops once a week for three weeks. Each week, the group of children waiting at the Tempelhof airport fence grew significantly.|$|E

5|$|Another common {{trick was}} to swallow 30 to 50 unshelled {{hazelnuts}} (although {{one of his}} posters advertised 40 pecans), followed by another nut of a different variety, such as an almond.

In another trick, Ali swallowed three to six <b>handkerchiefs</b> of different hues and then produced them in a color order requested by audience members.|$|E
5|$|In another {{patrol in}} July, U-14 sailed {{on the north}} side of the island of Corfu while headed for Santi Quaranta, Albania. Because the harbor at Corfu was {{occupied}} by the French fleet at the time, U-14 conducted a ruse de guerre by flying the submarine's former national flag, the French tricolor, in order to pass unmolested. Even though U-14s new conning tower made her look unlike any other Brumaire-class boat, one French patrol plane was successfully fooled by the ruse. When U-14s crew first spotted the aircraft, flying towards them from the direction of the sun, there was not enough time to submerge. As the aircraft drew near, its French markings—and its cargo of bombs—became apparent to the crew. With no other course of action possible, U-14s crew waved their hats and <b>handkerchiefs</b> at the plane. As the French pilot passed overhead, he returned the waves, apparently unaware of the U-boat's true nationality. The only success by U-14 on this cruise was the sinking of Marionga Goulandris, a Greek steamer, near Cape Matapan.|$|E

60|$|Raymond said nothing, {{but he took}} a <b>handkerchief</b> out of {{his jacket}} pocket, and spread it out upon the ground, and put his birch bark box upon it. He then laid the {{squirrel}} gently in upon the <b>handkerchief,</b> which thus served for a bottom. Next he drew {{the corners of the}} <b>handkerchief</b> up over the top, and tied the opposite pairs of ends together. Thus the <b>handkerchief</b> served for top, bottom, and handle.|$|R
5|$|The McClintock {{expedition}} {{also found}} a human skeleton on the southern coast of King William Island. Still clothed, it was searched, and some papers were found, including a seaman's certificate for Chief Petty Officer Henry Peglar (b. 1808), Captain of the Foretop, HMS Terror. However, since the uniform {{was that of a}} ship's steward, {{it is more likely that}} the body was that of Thomas Armitage, gun-room steward on Terror and a shipmate of Peglar, whose papers he carried. At another site on the western extreme of the island, Hobson discovered a lifeboat containing two skeletons and relics from the Franklin expedition. In the boat was a large amount of abandoned equipment, including boots, silk <b>handkerchiefs,</b> scented soap, sponges, slippers, hair combs, and many books, among them a copy of The Vicar of Wakefield. McClintock also took testimony from the Inuit about the expedition's disastrous end.|$|E
5|$|Club {{competition}} {{paused in}} the last week of March, resuming over the first weekend of April. Benfica's first game was a visit to nearby Estádio da Reboleira to meet Estrela da Amadora. Referee Hugo Miguel called three penalties in the first half-hour: two for Benfica and one for Estrela. Cardozo converted both (in the fifth and 16th minutes), and Silvestre Varela scored for Estrela in a 2–1 final result. Sánchez Flores said that although Benfica played poorly, winning was what mattered. On 11 April, Benfica hosted Académica in another home loss; a 23rd-minute goal by William Tiero secured Académica's second consecutive away win against Benfica. The loss ended any hope of winning the title, since Porto had an eight-point lead. The race for second place (and a UEFA Champions League spot) also experienced a setback, since Sporting now had a four-point lead. The fans turned on Sánchez Flores, waving white <b>handkerchiefs</b> in the traditional request for resignation. The Spaniard realised that winning the Primeira Liga was nearly impossible, and Benfica should focus on qualifying for the Champions League. The club rebounded with an away win against Vitória de Setúbal. They started strong, scoring three goals in the first half for a final score of 4–0. Cardozo and Nuno Gomes scored two goals apiece. A week after Setúbal, Benfica hosted Marítimo for April's final match. By the 38th minute, the club was winning 3–0. Marítimo reacted, cutting Benfica's lead to 3–2 in the 60th minute, but the club defended their lead. Although Sánchez Flores was happy with the three points, he said that Benfica should have better controlled the game.|$|E

Lescure led his men in {{a courageous}} charge under enemy fire, {{shouting}} 'Long live the king!' and braving cannonfire, which left him unharmed. Likewise La Rochejacquelein wore his distinctive three red <b>handkerchiefs</b> on his head, waist and neck even though the gunners in the Republican forces were aiming for them.

The fork is initially held unseen by the magician, who introduces the trick and produces a <b>handkerchief.</b> The <b>handkerchief</b> is folded in half to form a rectangle and laid {{on the table with}} the long axis pointed towards the magician. Using sleight of hand, the fork is placed on the table under the <b>handkerchief</b> at the same time, with the tines facing upward {{near the edge of the}} table nearest the magician. The magician then produces a spoon, which is inserted into the <b>handkerchief</b> so it lies between the folds of the <b>handkerchief,</b> positioned so it is over the fork. Performing a flourish with both hands over the <b>handkerchief,</b> the magician presses down on the tines of the fork with his thumb, causing the handle to lever and force the spoon upward.|$|R
