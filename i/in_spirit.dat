5|$|Born <b>in</b> <b>Spirit</b> Lake, Iowa, Bedell {{was educated}} <b>in</b> <b>Spirit</b> Lake public schools. He {{graduated}} from Spirit Lake High School in 1939, where he earned spending money {{with a business}} {{in the midst of}} the Great Depression. His business involved braiding dog hairs around fishhooks, the result of which could be sold as fish flies. He began tying the fly-fishing lures in his bedroom, then he moved the business into his parents' basement. In time, he got space above a grocery store to continue the business full-time.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{who could}} leave their body <b>in</b> <b>spirit</b> during sleep were called burkudzäutä among the Ossetians of the Caucasus, {{and they were}} called mazzeri in parts of Corsica. The burkudzäutä, mounted on animals or {{household}} objects, flew on a night between Christmas and New Year to burku, {{the land of the}} dead described as a great meadow. There they collected the seeds of agricultural plants and took them to their village, thus ensuring a rich harvest. The dead pursued and shot arrows at them as they flew back home. The wounded burkudzäutä would fall sick after the return, and some of them would die. The mazzeri of neighbouring villages fought each other <b>in</b> <b>spirit</b> on the night between 31July and 1August. The village of the defeated mazzeri would suffer more deaths during the next year.|$|E
5|$|The armier {{were men}} from Ariège in the Pyrenees who {{could see and}} talk to the souls of the dead. The mesultane were women and girls in Georgia who plunged into a {{lethargy}} and travelled <b>in</b> <b>spirit</b> {{to the land of the}} dead, to communicate with them.|$|E
60|$|In museums a {{vast amount}} of {{difference}} is seen in the colours of this species, caused by the method of preparation: if dried without having been <b>in</b> <b>spirits,</b> and subsequently kept dry, the orange tint round the orifice is preserved; if kept long <b>in</b> <b>spirits,</b> this is quite lost; but sometimes <b>in</b> specimens <b>in</b> <b>spirits</b> the colour of the membrane of peduncle is preserved and rendered pinker. The colours of the sack and animal are either quite discharged or rendered extremely dark. The valves themselves also often become more opaque. In some specimens well preserved <b>in</b> <b>spirits,</b> the sack and cirri were purplish-brown or lead-colour, tinted with dirty green, or orange, or bright yellow, or brick-red.|$|R

5|$|Czech {{national}} opera {{until this}} {{time had been}} represented only by minor, rarely performed works. This opera, Smetana's second, {{was part of his}} quest to create a truly Czech operatic genre. Smetana's musical treatment made considerable use of traditional Bohemian dance forms such as the polka and furiant, and although he largely avoided the direct quotation of folksong he neverthess created music considered by Czechs to be quintessentially Czech <b>in</b> <b>spirit.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{rituals of}} Cherry’s flock {{incorporated}} many Jewish practices and prohibitions alongside some Christian traditions. For example, during prayer the men wore skullcaps and congregants faced east. In addition, {{members of the}} Church were not permitted to eat pork. Prayers were accompanied by musical instruments and gospel singing. After Cherry's death, {{members of the church}} believed that he had left temporarily and would soon reappear <b>in</b> <b>spirit</b> in order to lead the church through his son.|$|E

5|$|Caligula's first acts {{were said}} to be generous <b>in</b> <b>spirit,</b> though many were {{political}} in nature. To gain support, he granted bonuses to the military, including the Praetorian Guard, city troops and the army outside Italy. He destroyed Tiberius's treason papers, declared that treason trials were a thing of the past, and recalled those who had been sent into exile. He helped those who had been harmed by the imperial tax system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish spectacles for the public, including gladiatorial games. Caligula collected and brought back the bones of his mother and of his brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.|$|E
5|$|It was {{believed}} in southern Poland that clouds and hail were produced by creatures named płanetnik, chmurnik, or obłocznik: they compressed fog into clouds, and fragmented ice with iron flails into hailstones. They {{were considered to}} be the spirits of infants who had died without baptism, or the spirits of drowned and hanged people. Such spirits were seen in Serbia as bringers of hail clouds; they were addressed in folk spells, with which they were made to lead the clouds away from the village. According to other notions, płanetniks were persons who flew into the sky during storms. They could fly <b>in</b> <b>spirit,</b> while they were in deep sleep, or they could fly in body and soul. The płanetniks were friendly toward humans, often warning them about the approach of a storm or hail. They could direct the movement of clouds.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the films}} noir of the classic period were {{similarly}} low- and modestly budgeted features without major stars—B movies either literally or <b>in</b> <b>spirit.</b> In this production context, writers, directors, cinematographers, and other craftsmen were relatively free from typical big-picture constraints. There was more visual experimentation than in Hollywood filmmaking as a whole: the Expressionism now closely associated with noir and the semi-documentary style that later emerged represent two very different tendencies. Narrative structures sometimes involved convoluted flashbacks uncommon in non-noir commercial productions. In terms of content, enforcement of the Production Code ensured that no film character could literally {{get away with murder}} or be seen sharing a bed with anyone but a spouse; within those bounds, however, many films now identified as noir feature plot elements and dialogue that were very risqué for the time.|$|E

5|$|There are 19 {{surviving}} hoopoe starling specimens {{in museums}} {{around the world}} (including one skeleton and two specimens preserved <b>in</b> <b>spirit),</b> two in the Paris museum and four in Troyes. Additional skins in Turin, Livorno, and Caen were destroyed during World War II, and four skins have disappeared from Réunion and Mauritius (which now have one each). Specimens were sent to Europe beginning {{in the second half}} of the 18th century, with most collected during the first half of the 19th century. It is unclear when each specimen was acquired, and specimens were frequently moved between collections. It is also unclear which specimens were the basis for which descriptions and illustrations. The only known subfossil hoopoe starling specimen is a femur, discovered in 1993 in a Réunion grotto.|$|E
5|$|A krsnik or kresnik {{was a man}} {{born with}} a caul, who could leave his body <b>in</b> <b>spirit</b> {{transformed}} into an animal. He fought demonic men called vukodlak (werewolves) and other evil agents. His victory meant that his village would have the abundance {{of all sorts of}} agricultural products. The krsnik was recorded in Istria, Gorski Kotar, the Kvarner Gulf, and parts of Slovenia. The benandanti were men born with a caul recorded in the region of Friuli in north-eastern Italy. They periodically fought for the fertility of the fields against male and female witches. The táltos, recorded in Hungary, were men and women born with teeth or some other physical peculiarity. They periodically fought each other in the shape of animals or flames. Their battles were often accompanied by storms. The winner would ensure abundant harvest for his village. The benandanti and the táltos were initiated at a certain age into their vocation by an older member of the same group, who visited them in a vision.|$|E
5|$|Choosing {{to support}} a Reason {{will result in a}} {{different}} ending depending on who is chosen, but in each the world is reborn {{in the image of the}} chosen Reason after the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi to prove his resolve. Chiaki and Isamu die before the Demi-fiend begins and give him their blessing <b>in</b> <b>spirit</b> form, while Hikawa accompanies the Demi-fiend into their new world. If Takao's wishes are followed, the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi and the world is returned to its pre-Conception state, resurrecting and restoring all the main characters. If the Demi-fiend rejects Takao's wishes, Kagutsuchi curses him for allowing the world to die and departs, leaving the Demi-fiend as the only survivor in a barren world of demons, trapped as it is until another Conception can happen. If the Demi-fiend fulfills Lucifer's request of collecting the Candelabra from the Fiends, Kagutsuchi attacks him and is destroyed, breaking the Great Will's control over the worlds. After this, Lucifer fights the Demi-fiend to test his strength, then declares him to be the ultimate weapon in the upcoming war against the Great Will.|$|E

5|$|Although Kratos killed Poseidon, he was {{abandoned}} by Gaia when his {{first encounter with}} Zeus went poorly. Stranded in the Underworld and now betrayed by both the Olympians and Titans, Kratos learned from the spirit of Athena, who also provided the Blades of Exile, {{that he needed to}} find the Flame of Olympus, which is the key to defeating Zeus. Kratos murdered both Titans and gods, ignoring the warnings of his victims as he sought the Flame. Realizing the key to pacifying the Flame and reaching Pandora's Box (engulfed by the Flame) is Pandora herself, Kratos came to care for Pandora, who reminded him of his lost daughter Calliope. Kratos showed humanity when he attempted to stop Pandora from sacrificing herself to quench the Flame, but reluctantly allowed the act when she said there was no other option. Finding the box empty, and driven berserk by Zeus' mockery, Kratos attacked his father. Although Gaia interrupted and tried to kill Kratos and Zeus, she was destroyed by Kratos, who then apparently defeated Zeus. Zeus returned <b>in</b> <b>spirit</b> form and attacked Kratos, who retreated into his psyche. Kratos forgave himself for his past sins with the help of Lysandra. Pandora later appeared and told Kratos that hope would save him. Kratos was revived and easily destroyed Zeus. Athena confronted Kratos and demanded that he return the power of hope; the contents of Pandora's Box. In a selfless act, Kratos refused, stated his need for vengeance was gone and impaled himself with the Blade of Olympus, which dispersed the power across the world for mankind's use. Athena, disappointed with Kratos, removed the Blade and departed as Kratos collapsed next to the Blade of Olympus. The post-credits scene showed a trail of blood leading away from the Blade with Kratos' whereabouts unknown.|$|E
5|$|Compton {{was joined}} by his skipper Yardley and after playing defensively for a period, the pair rebuilt the innings, scoring 87 runs in 100 minutes. After the loss of four quick wickets, the Compton and Yardley elected to not play at any balls that {{were not on the}} line of the stumps, and Lindwall and Johnston were taken off to recuperate ahead of the second new ball. Australia had the option of taking the new ball just before the tea break, but Bradman decided to wait so his two pacemen could have an extra 20 minutes to {{replenish}} their energy levels. Meanwhile, Johnson and Toshack operated, and the English duo played them cautiously and comfortably. At tea, England had recovered to be 129/4, with Compton on 51 and Yardley 42. The English captain had been particularly successful against Johnson, capitalising on a series of overpitched balls and driving them away for runs. After tea, Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball, but the former appeared to be tired and lacking <b>in</b> <b>spirit</b> in his first over. Compton edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller took a low catch, ending his innings for 53. One run later, Lindwall clipped Yardley's off stump with the first ball of the next over to leave England at 134/6; the home skipper had made 44 before an outswinger had evaded his bat as he attempted to play a back foot defensive shot. Evans came to the crease and tried to counter-attack, hitting Lindwall for a boundary past square leg. Johnston then removed Evans for nine, caught by a diving Miller from a swing of the bat wide outside off stump, leaving the hosts at 145/7.|$|E

40|$|The Bachelor thesis "The {{methanol}} <b>in</b> <b>spirits</b> {{and possibilities}} its detection" describes the basis alcohols, their occurence and properties. The {{detailed description of}} methanol, its chemical and physical properties, use, manufacture and physiological effects are described. The work was also focused on ethanol, its production, properties, metabolism and its wide range of applications. The work refers to a danger of methanol and ethanol {{and what they can}} cause when they are eaten. Part of Bachelor thesis is devoted to the possibilities of methanol detection, where the methods of methanol detection <b>in</b> <b>spirits</b> with a focus on the determination of methanol by gas and liquid chromatography are described and the description of the lesser known methods as well. The work also describes the methods, which are used for detection of the presence of methanol <b>in</b> <b>spirits</b> that exist on the Internet and where their functionality is not proven and these are dangerous due to the possibility of subsequent methanol poisoning. Conclusion of the literary part is dedicated to the legislation about spirit drinks. The new law about mandatory labeling of <b>spirits,</b> which arose <b>in</b> connection with the methanol affair is mentioned as well. The practical part was focused on the applicability of the method for methanol detection <b>in</b> <b>spirits,</b> which is described in the literature. It has ben proven that the certified method is not suitable to detect the presence of methanol <b>in</b> <b>spirits...</b>|$|R
