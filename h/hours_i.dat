Turn to, to ‘shoot away’, pick up and store the catch and clean up. We worked bloody long <b>hours.</b> <b>I</b> think there were six deckies, four firemen, one engineer, one wireless operator and the master and mate. The galley was right aft with the mess room beneath. You would get your feed, climb down the hatchway to the mess room below. We would get {{a bucket of water}} from the galley to take to the forecastle where we bunked. By the time we got forward we would have only half a bucket of hot water to wash in but after a couple of days you didn’t worry about washing. You were wet through most of the time so it didn’t matter.|$|E

500|$|Drake was obsessive about practising {{his guitar}} technique, and would often stay {{up through the}} night experimenting with tunings and working on songs. His mother remembered hearing him [...] "bumping around at all <b>hours.</b> <b>I</b> think he wrote his nicest melodies in the early-morning hours." [...] Self-taught, he {{achieved}} his guitar style {{through the use of}} alternative tunings to create cluster chords. These are difficult to achieve on a guitar using standard tuning; Drake used tunings which made cluster chords available using more conventional chord shapes. In many songs he accents the dissonant effect of such non-standard tunings through his vocal melodies.|$|E
500|$|Britten, like Elgar and Walton before him, {{was signed}} up {{by a major}} British {{recording}} company, and performed a considerable proportion of his output on disc. For the Decca Record Company he made some monaural records in the 1940s and 1950s, followed, with the enthusiastic support of the Decca producer John Culshaw, by numerous stereophonic versions of his works. Culshaw wrote, [...] "The happiest <b>hours</b> <b>I</b> have spent in any studio were with Ben, for the basic reason {{that it did not}} seem that we were trying to make records or video tapes; we were just trying to make music." ...|$|E
500|$|Firmly contesting Carr's argument, {{journalist}} John Battelle {{praised the}} virtues of the web: [...] "hen I am deep in search for knowledge on the web, jumping from link to link, reading deeply in one moment, skimming hundreds of links the next, when I am pulling back to formulate and reformulate queries and devouring new connections as quickly as Google and the Web can serve them up, when I am performing bricolage in real time over the course of <b>hours,</b> <b>I</b> am 'feeling' my brain light up, I and [...] 'feeling' like I'm getting smarter". Web journalist Scott Rosenberg reported that his reading habits are the same as they were when he [...] "was a teenager plowing [...] way through a shelf of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky". In book critic Scott Esposito's view, [...] "responsible adults" [...] have always had to deal with distractions, and, in his own case, he claimed to remain [...] "fully able to turn down the noise" [...] and read deeply.|$|E

[...] As an Immortal, MacLeod is also sterile and Tessa resigns herself to having no children. [...] "" [...] deals with Tessa's choice and its impact upon her life.

But, she's not... I have my own life and it's more than enough." [...] Panzer commented that [...] "The Sea Witch" [...] "...brings forth in a very powerful way what exactly 's giving up to be with MacLeod." ...|$|E
500|$|Nelson's {{body was}} placed in a cask of brandy mixed with camphor and myrrh, which was then lashed to the Victory's {{mainmast}} and placed under guard. Victory was towed to Gibraltar after the battle, and on arrival the body was transferred to a lead-lined coffin filled with spirits of wine. Collingwood's dispatches about the battle were carried to England aboard , and when the news arrived in London, a messenger was sent to Merton Place to bring the news of Nelson's death to Emma Hamilton. She later recalled, They brought me word, Mr Whitby from the Admiralty. [...] "Show him in directly", I said. He came in, and with a pale countenance and faint voice, said, [...] "We have gained a great Victory." [...] – [...] "Never mind your Victory", I said. [...] "My letters – give me my letters" [...] – Captain Whitby was unable to speak – tears in his eyes and a deathly paleness over his face made me comprehend him. I believe I gave a scream and fell back, and for ten <b>hours</b> <b>I</b> could neither speak nor shed a tear.|$|E
500|$|Drummer Butch Vig {{stated that}} the album is a [...] "much simpler record than Version 2.0": [...] "All of the songs sort of came from us playing live downstairs [...] with guitar, bass and drums ... That was the only {{conscious}} decision we made – to make the songs simpler. Some of the songs are still layered in spots; compared to the last record, there're about half as many tracks. As far as sounds go, it's basically drums, bass, some heavy guitars and Shirley singing." [...] Erikson agreed that a more organic sound and simplistic approach with respect to production is embodied by the final mix of the album. [...] "A lot of songs took shape {{in just a few}} hours as opposed to a few months with the last record.Some of the songs obviously took a long time, or we wouldn't have been in the studio for a full year. But a lot of them happened very quickly. 'Silence Is Golden' we recorded basically in three days and it was done. 'So Like a Rose,' for the most part, was recorded in three <b>hours.</b> <b>I</b> think we spent a lot of time just trying to resist adding stuff to [...] Because that was our tendency on the other two records.” On the lyrical content of the songs, Vig remarked that [...] " [...] aren't specifically responses to the industry, but they could be read that way. Shirley has said that, for example, 'Shut Your Mouth' is about all the bullshit that's out there, but it's also a sort of note to self to keep your mouth shut, because she says she's the biggest, most opinionated loudmouth of anyone around. So they work on multiple levels." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sikorsky began {{studying}} at the Saint Petersburg Maritime Cadet Corps, in 1903, {{at the age}} of 14. In 1906, he determined that his future lay in engineering, so he resigned from the academy, despite his satisfactory standing, and left the Russian Empire to study in Paris. He returned to the Russian Empire in 1907, enrolling at the Mechanical College of the Kiev Polytechnic Institute. After the academic year, Sikorsky again accompanied his father to Germany in the summer of 1908, where he learned of the accomplishments of the Wright brothers' Flyer and Ferdinand von Zeppelin's dirigible. Sikorsky later said about this event: [...] "Within twenty-four <b>hours,</b> <b>I</b> decided to change my life's work. I would study aviation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of {{his early}} days, Capote related, [...] "I began writing {{really sort of}} seriously when I was about eleven.

[...] In 1935, he attended the Trinity School in New York City. He then attended St. Joseph Military Academy. In 1939, the Capote family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, and Truman attended Greenwich High School, where he wrote for both the school's literary journal, The Green Witch, and the school newspaper. When they returned to New York City in 1942, he attended the Franklin School, an Upper West Side private school now known as the Dwight School, and graduated in 1943. That was the end of his formal education.|$|E

In December 2004, the Washington Post summarized Goeglein's job as [...] "to make sure conservatives are happy, in the loop and getting their best ideas before the president and turned into laws." [...] Writing in the New York Times, reporter David D. Kirkpatrick described him as [...] "Mr. Rove's legman on the right". Edwin Feulner, president of The Heritage Foundation, said in June 2004 that he and Goeglein saw each other {{two or three times}} a week, and [...] "If I have a message I want to get to Rove or the administration, I will scribble out a note to Tim, and within 24 <b>hours</b> <b>I</b> will get a response back.

2500|$|Reflecting on {{the early}} result, which had left him [...] "submerged into {{complete}} happiness", and on the new vote, which he believed was a mere technicality introduced on purpose by Justice Minister Constantin Dissescu, he recalled: [...] "for 24 <b>hours</b> <b>I</b> was politically [...] within the Romanian nationhood!" [...] He recalled having been received by King Carol, who reportedly agreed with his belief that the action was abusive. By then, Șăineanu also lost the support of Hasdeu, who, like Take Ionescu, gave his approval to a restructuring of the University, which stripped the Jewish scholar of his honorary position. He sought instead backing from Petre P. Carp, the Conservative doyen, who reportedly answered his request with the ambiguous Latin adage Gutta cavat lapidem ("The water drop will drill through stone"). On {{the other side of}} the divide, the attacks on Șăineanu had come to be led by the antisemitic paper Apărarea Națională, whose articles, the scholar argued, [...] "reached the summit of stupidity and ridiculousness".|$|E
2500|$|Sain {{considered}} Atrocious Virgin to {{be among}} his best work, referring to it on the Trance to the Sun Bandcamp website as their [...] "gothic-psychedelia magnum opus".

To do that kind of studio work by yourself, you have to take careful notes.

[...] "Map of The Lost" [...] {{is one of the greatest}} pieces I've ever come up with.
