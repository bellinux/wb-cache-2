50|$|In the West Country Courtenay hounded Bonville without mercy, {{and pursued}} him to Taunton Castle and laid siege to it. York arrived {{to lift the}} siege, and imprisoned Bonville, who was {{nevertheless}} quickly released. This exploit ended with the disgrace of all three 'Yorkists' and their submission to royal mercy in March. The King had issued an arrest warrant on 24 September 1451, drafted by Somerset, to be enforced by Butler and Bonville. The Yorkist rebellions prompted royal commissions for Buckingham and Bonville on 14 February 1452. A <b>direct</b> <b>summons</b> without delay was ordered by Royal Proclamation on 17 February to bring Courtenay and Lord Cobham to London.|$|R
50|$|The {{player can}} {{increase}} Ash's health and melee damage. While the power-ups: super boomstick, the wrong book, arrow volley, magic words, catapult volley and deathcoaster provide services such <b>direct</b> damage, <b>summoning</b> random health amounts to Ash or his army, summoning random soldiers, creating mass damage, and pushing back hordes.|$|R
50|$|The {{justice of}} the peace can issue a <b>summons</b> <b>directing</b> the {{offender}} to attend court or can issue a warrant for his or her arrest.|$|R
5000|$|Free Magic Elementals: These are free-willed beings wholly {{composed}} of Free Magic. The most common elementals belong to specific [...] "breeds" [...] (such as Stilken, Magrue, Jerreq, or Hish), while {{the most powerful}} are unique, or [...] "of a singular nature". Though [...] "many thousands" [...] of Free Magic Elementals escaped {{the creation of the}} Charter, most were later imprisoned or enslaved by it. Of the remainder, [...] "no truly dangerous creature of Free Magic has woken in a thousand years, save to the sound of Mosrael and Saraneth, or by a <b>direct</b> <b>summons</b> using their secret names". Some cannot be destroyed except by a Free Magic sorcerer more powerful than they, or by immersion in running water (though Free Magic creatures of the Third Kindred, or those infused with the essence of the Nine, are exempt from this rule). Charter Magic is typically ineffective.|$|R
5000|$|The King fixated {{the basis}} of his Brazilian policy in two main points: the {{research}} of precious metals and stones and the expansion of the borders of the colony to the banks of the Río de la Plata. He sent the Viscount of Barbacena to Brazil with instructions to encourage the mining explorations. The reputation of the Paulistas was such that, urged by Barbacena, Peter wrote to twelve frontiersmen Piratinganos, and provided them with the [...] "incomparable honor" [...] of a <b>direct</b> interpellation, <b>summoning</b> them to place their employment at the royal service.|$|R
60|$|Wilder {{did as he}} was <b>directed.</b> His first <b>summons</b> {{was either}} unheard or disregarded. On repeating it, he was bid to enter. The young seaman opened the door, with a crowd of sensations, that will find their {{solution}} in the succeeding parts of our narrative and instantly stood, under the light of a powerful lamp, {{in the presence of the}} stranger in green.|$|R
50|$|Later, {{the king}} started {{to create new}} baronies {{in one of two}} ways: by a writ of <b>summons</b> <b>directing</b> a chosen man to attend Parliament, and in an even later {{development}} by letters patent. Writs of summons became the normal method in medieval times, displacing the method of feudal barony, but creation of baronies by letters patent is the sole method adopted in modern times.|$|R
50|$|There {{were also}} five basic villain archetypes. Brutes dealt {{increasing}} damage as they attacked or were themselves attacked. Corruptors could cause damage at range, with high chance for critical hits against wounded targets. Dominators assailed enemies with status effects and <b>direct</b> damage. Masterminds <b>summoned,</b> upgraded, and controlled combat pets. Stalkers were stealthy fighters, dealing critical hits when hidden or when {{accompanied by a}} team.|$|R
60|$|A glance of Miss Peyton's eye {{recalled}} Colonel Wellmere to a {{sense of}} his duty, and springing from his chair, he assured the surgeon that in no way could he confer a greater obligation on himself than by sending for that very ring. The operator bowed a little haughtily, and withdrew to fulfill his promise, by dispatching a messenger on the errand. The aunt suffered him to retire; but unwillingness to admit a stranger into the privacy of their domestic arrangements induced her to follow and tender the services of Caesar, instead of those of Sitgreaves' man, who had volunteered for this duty. Katy Haynes was accordingly <b>directed</b> to <b>summon</b> the black to the vacant parlor, and thither Miss Peyton and the surgeon repaired, to give their several instructions.|$|R
50|$|Failure {{to appear}} {{is the legal}} term {{for the failure of}} a {{defendant}} or respondent to appear at (or within) the stated time before a tribunal as <b>directed</b> in a <b>summons.</b> Where the conduct alleged in the summons or complaint is an infraction or summary offence, failure to appear is a crime for which a bench-warrant can be issued if the defendant promised to appear. If the conduct alleged is a tort or other cause for civil action, failure to appear generally results in a default judgment by the court in favor of the plaintiff/petitioner.|$|R
50|$|Punja was not {{encouraged}} {{by the idea of}} conquest but agreed to the idea of marriage. He advised that his proposal would be entertained only if he defeat the Rao of Cutch. Rao heard about the incoming army and <b>directed</b> Jivan to <b>summon</b> the Abdasa and Vagad Girasias to defend the country. The whole Bhayat, except the Mothala chief who was friendly to Punja, readily answered the summons, and took the field under the minister. Godji remained in command at Bhuj which he garrisoned with 1000 men from Navanagar and a body of Radhanpur troops.|$|R
60|$|When Hiram Doolittle had {{obtained}} his search-warrant, his first business was to procure a proper officer {{to see it}} executed. The sheriff was absent, summoning in person the grand inquest for the county; the deputy who resided in the village was riding on the same errand, in {{a different part of}} the settlement; and the regular constable of the township had been selected for his station from motives of charity, being lame of a leg. Hiram intended to accompany the officer as a spectator, but he felt no very strong desire to bear the brunt of the battle. It was, however, Saturday, and the sun was already turning the shadows of the pines toward the east; on the morrow the conscientious magistrate could not engage in such an expedition at the peril of his soul and long before Monday, the venison, and all vestiges of the death of the deer, might be secreted or destroyed. Happily, the lounging form of Billy Kirby met his eye, and Hiram, at all time fruitful in similar expedients, saw his way clear at once. Jotham, who was associated in the whole business, and who had left the mountain in consequence of a summons from his coadjutor, but who failed, equally with Hiram, in the unfortunate particular of nerve, was <b>directed</b> to <b>summon</b> the wood-chopper to the dwelling of the magistrate.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{the filing}} of the application, the Court may either make an order immediately, or <b>direct</b> that a <b>summons</b> for the order for review of {{detention}} be issued to enable all the parties involved to present arguments to the Court. If the latter course is taken, the ex parte originating summons, supporting affidavit, order of court and summons must be served on the person against whom the order is sought. Unless the Court directs otherwise, {{it is not necessary}} for the person under restraint to be brought before the Court for the hearing of the application. In addition, the Court may order that the person be released while the application is being heard. Once the Court decides to make an order for review of detention, it will direct when the person under restraint is to be brought before the court.|$|R
50|$|What {{is meant}} by {{the title of this}} work is by no means clear. Haubold (de Edictis Monitoriis ac Brevibus, Leipzig, 1804) thinks that monitory edicts are not special writs of notice or <b>summons</b> <b>directed</b> to the parties {{in the course of a}} cause, but those general clauses of the edictum perpetuum which relate to the law of procedure, giving actions and other {{remedies}} on certain conditions, and therefore, tacitly at least, containing warnings as to the consequences of irregularity or nonfulfilment of the prescribed conditions. The fragments of Callistratus certainly afford much support to this view. Haubold distinguishes the edictum monitorium from the edictum breve, upon which Paulus wrote a treatise. The latter he supposes to consist of those new clauses, which, in process of time, were added as an appendage to the edictum perpetuum, after the main body of it had acquired a constant form.|$|R
40|$|CD 4 + T {{cells are}} {{essential}} to pathogenesis of ocular surface disease in dry eye. Two subtypes of CD 4 + T cells, Th 1 and Th 17 cells, function concurrently in dry eye to mediate disease. This occurs {{in spite of the}} cross-regulation of IFN-c and IL- 17 A, the prototypical cytokines Th 1 and Th 17 cells, respectively. Essential to an effective immune response are chemokines that <b>direct</b> and <b>summon</b> lymphocytes to specific tissues. T cell trafficking has been extensively studied in other models, {{but this is the first}} study to examine the role of chemokine receptors in ocular immune responses. Here, we demonstrate that the chemokine receptors, CCR 6 and CXCR 3, which are expressed on Th 17 and Th 1 cells, respectively, are required for the pathogenesis of dry eye disease, as CCR 6 KO and CXCR 3 KO mice do not develop disease under desiccating stress. CD 4 + T cells from CCR 6 KO and CXCR 3 KO mice exposed to desiccating stress (DS) do not migrate to the ocular surface, but remain in the superficial cervical lymph nodes. In agreement with this, CD 4 + T cells from CCR 6 and CXCR 3 deficient donors exposed to DS, when adoptively transferred to T cell deficient recipients manifest minimal signs of dry eye disease, including significantly less T cell infiltration, goblet cell loss, and expression of inflammatory cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase expression compared to wild-type donors. These findings highlight the important interaction of chemokine receptors on T cells and chemokine ligand expression on epithelial cells of the cornea and conjunctiva in dry eye pathogenesis and revea...|$|R

5000|$|A hermit lived alone. One day, a box floated {{down the}} river to him. It {{contained}} a beautiful boy child, Făt-Frumos, and a letter saying {{that his mother was}} a king's daughter who had erred and done this out of fear of her parents. A grape vine sprung up in his hut, and with its fruit, he was able to feed the child. When he was grown, the hermit died, telling him that a lion would come to dig his grave, and that he should take the horse reins in the attic, which, if he shook, would bring him a horse. He did as his foster father said. The horse gave him clothing, and he rode off. At the horse's direction, he took service with three fairies. The horse told him that every seven years, their bathroom had a flow of gold that would turn anyone's hair gold; it also had a chest with three magnificent suits of clothing. One day, the fairies went to a party but <b>directed</b> him to <b>summon</b> them back if the gold started to flow. It did. The horse directed him to bathe in it himself and take the clothes. He did, and they escaped the fairies.|$|R
