40|$|Schema {{validation}} {{and view}} updating are database engineering problems {{which seem to}} differ significantly. Hence, for solving them, significantly different approaches are taken, usually. However, one of the contributions of this paper is: We show that any sound method <b>for</b> <b>view</b> updating can effectively be used also for validating schema specifications. We consider typical schema validation tasks such as checking schema satisfiability, liveliness of a predicate, reachability of partially specified states and redundancy of integrity constraint specifications, and we show how, with any sound method <b>for</b> <b>view</b> updating, these tasks can be tackled in a uniform way. For illustrating our point, we shortly recapitulate a concrete method <b>for</b> <b>view</b> updating {{and apply it to}} tackle these tasks. We emphasize that our general approach is independent of any particular method <b>for</b> <b>view</b> updating. Other contributions consists in refined concepts of schema satisfiability and integrity redundance. Both can be e [...] ...|$|R
