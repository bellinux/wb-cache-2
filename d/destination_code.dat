2500|$|A {{telephone}} number {{serves as an}} address for switching telephone calls using a system of <b>destination</b> <b>code</b> routing. [...] Telephone numbers are entered or dialed by a calling party on the originating telephone set, which transmits the sequence of digits {{in the process of}} signaling to a telephone exchange. The exchange completes the call either to another locally connected subscriber or via the PSTN to the called party. Telephone numbers are assigned within the framework of a national or regional {{telephone number}}ing plan to subscribers by telephone service operators, which may be commercial entities, state-controlled administrations, or other telecommunication industry associations.|$|E

50|$|Swiss {{telephone}} numbers are ten digits long, and usually written 0AA BBB BB BB where 0AA {{is the national}} <b>destination</b> <b>code</b> and BBB BB BB is the subscriber number. The entire number must always be dialed, including the leading 0, even if calling within a local area, therefore the national <b>destination</b> <b>code</b> is not separated from the subscriber number. According to international convention, numbers are sometimes written +41 AA BBB BB BB to include the country calling code. Certain nationwide destination codes, such as for toll-free or premium-rate {{telephone numbers}}, are written 0800 BBB BBB or 0900 BBB BBB. Short numbers are used for emergency services such as 112 that are written 1CC or 1CCC.|$|E

50|$|The Swiss {{telephone}} {{numbering plan}} implements the ITU-T recommendation E.164 and is designated E.164/2002, {{based on its}} last major revision in 2002. It is a closed numbering plan, which means that all telephone numbers, including the area code, have a fixed number of digits. Swiss area codes are officially termed national <b>destination</b> <b>codes</b> (NDC). A complete telephone number consists of ten digits: 0xx xxx xx xx. Two formats are distinguished: three digits for the NDC and seven digits for the subscriber number, and four digits for the NDC and six digits for the subscriber number. However, a few exceptions exist.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{telephone numbers}} in Kenya are <b>destination</b> <b>codes</b> for international calls terminating in Kenya {{as well as}} the procedures for dialling internationally from within Kenya. Until 1999, Kenya shared its telephone numbering plan with Tanzania and Uganda, meaning that to make calls between the three countries, subscribers needed only dial the area code and number, a legacy of the East African Post and Telecommunications Corporation (EAPTC) which was dissolved in 1977. As a result of the reorganisation of Tanzania's numbering plan in that year, direct dialling was discontinued, although calls between the three countries do not require international dialling, only a special three-digit code.|$|R

40|$|Cooperative {{diversity}} {{allows a}} collection of radio terminals that relay signals for each other to emulate an antenna array and exploit spatial diversity in wireless fading channels. Analysis of performance in terms of information-theoretic outage probability leads to two key parameters for these systems, namely, network diversity order and network coding gain, corresponding to the slope and intercept, respectively, in a plot of log-outage versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in decibels (dB). This paper examines the network coding gains of various cooperative diversity protocols, studying the impact of transmission rate and network geometry on this important parameter. In particular, we observe that amplify-and-forward generally outperforms repetition decode-and-forward except when all the relays are {{much closer to the}} source than to the <b>destination.</b> <b>Coding</b> gains for amplify-and-forward relative to repetition decode-and-forward are determined and shown to match simulation results...|$|R

The software translation services take source and <b>destination</b> <b>code</b> pages as inputs.|$|E
50|$|A {{telephone}} {{numbering plan}} {{is a type of}} numbering scheme used in telecommunication to assign telephone numbers to subscriber telephones or other telephony endpoints. Telephone numbers are the addresses of participants in a telephone network, reachable by a system of <b>destination</b> <b>code</b> routing. Telephone numbering plans are defined in each of administrative regions of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and they are also present in private telephone networks. For public number systems, geographic location plays a role in the sequence of numbers assigned to each telephone subscriber.|$|E
50|$|Greek {{telephone}} numbers are ten digits long, and usually written AAB BBBBBBB or AAAB BBBBBB where AAB or AAAB is the 2- or 3-digit national area code plus the first digit of the subscriber number, and BBBBBBB or BBBBBB are the remaining digits of the subscriber number. The entire number {{must always be}} dialed, even if calling within the same local area, therefore the national <b>destination</b> <b>code</b> is not separated from the subscriber number. According to international convention, numbers are sometimes written +30 AAB BBBBBBB or +30 AAAB BBBBBB to include the country calling code.|$|E
