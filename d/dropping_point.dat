50|$|Lithium-based greases are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used; sodium and lithium-based greases have higher melting point (<b>dropping</b> <b>point)</b> than calcium-based greases but are not resistant to the action of water. Lithium-based grease has a <b>dropping</b> <b>point</b> at 190 to 220 °C (350 to 400 °F). However the maximum usable temperature for lithium-based grease is 120 °C.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dropping</b> <b>point</b> {{is used in}} {{combination}} with other testable properties to determine the suitability of greases for specific applications. It is applicable only to greases that contain soap thickeners. Greases with other thickeners, such as many synthetic greases, do not change state. Instead, they separate oil, and the <b>dropping</b> <b>point</b> as a phase transition does not apply.|$|E
50|$|A Helicopter <b>drop</b> <b>point,</b> or <b>drop</b> <b>point</b> {{is similar}} to a helispot, but used for depositing, often via longline, and caching supplies. Helicopters and supply {{vehicles}} use the <b>drop</b> <b>point</b> to off-load supplies at the edge of an incident for the ground teams to come by and pick up. <b>Drop</b> <b>points</b> may be located all around the fire. Wildland firefighters will usually pick up sharpened tools, pumps and hoses, water, food, radio batteries, etc. at the <b>drop</b> <b>points.</b> On an incident map, the symbol for a <b>drop</b> <b>point</b> is a filled dot with the letters D-# next to them with the # designating which number is it.|$|R

5000|$|To {{execute a}} test, the oil/block is heated, while being stirred, {{at a rate}} of [...] to [...] per minute until the {{temperature}} is approximately [...] below the expected <b>dropping</b> <b>point.</b> The heat is reduced until the test tube temperature is at most [...] less than the oil/block temperature. Once the temperature has stabilized the sample is inserted. The <b>dropping</b> <b>point</b> is the temperature recorded on the test tube thermometer, plus a correction factor for the oil/block temperature, when a drop of grease falls {{through the hole in the}} grease cup. If the drop trails a thread, the dropping temperature is the temperature at which the thread breaks.D-2265 explains that the <b>dropping</b> <b>point</b> is useful to assist in identifying the type of grease, and for establishing and maintaining benchmarks for quality control. It adds that the results are not sufficient to assess service performance because <b>dropping</b> <b>point</b> is a static test.|$|E

5000|$|The clip point style {{allows a}} quicker, and thus deeper, {{puncture}} upon insertion (clip point knives being thinner at the spine). The <b>drop</b> <b>point</b> {{has a slightly}} slower insertion due to its thicker spine near the tip. The <b>drop</b> <b>point</b> knife allows for more control when cutting, has a slower withdrawal time, and better negotiates [...] "drawn out" [...] (carving like) operations. The clip point lends itself to a quicker [...] "stabbing" [...] advantage with less drag during insertion and faster withdrawal. Compared to the <b>drop</b> <b>point</b> design, the clip point has a narrower and comparatively weaker tip. [...] The clip point is also weaker than the spear point, {{and for this reason}} the latter is favored for most thrusting knives, such as the dagger.|$|R

This station was equipped with the bomb's range value calculated earlier, and had used this to calculate the distance between their station and the bomber {{at the point where the}} bombs needed to be dropped. When this mouse station saw the bomber approaching the <b>drop</b> <b>point,</b> it sent a series of Morse code signals to inform the pilot that the <b>drop</b> <b>point</b> was approaching. At the precise instant, it would send another morse signal that would drop the bombs automatically.|$|R

5000|$|Lithium 12-hydroxystearate {{exhibits}} high {{oxidation stability}} and a <b>dropping</b> <b>point</b> up to around 200 °C. Most greases used today in motor vehicles, aircraft, and heavy machinery contain lithium stearates, mainly lithium 12-hydroxystearate. [...] Greases {{can be made}} with the addition of several different metallic soaps. Some greases are prepared from sodium, barium, lithium, and calcium soaps. Lithium soap greases are preferred for their water resistance, and their oxidative and mechanical stability. Depending on the grease, they also have good performance at high or low temperatures, but not both.|$|E
50|$|In 1946 a French officer, Captain Henri Debrus (later {{promoted}} Colonel and President of the Conseil International du Sport Militaire (CISM)) {{conceived the}} idea of organising a sports competition reserved exclusively for the army. It was during discussions held at Frankfurt am Main {{which led to the}} setting up of the Allied Forces Sports Council, that his attention was drawn to an original military physical training technique used, at that time, by the Netherlands airborne units. After being dropped over a given zone, parachutists had to travel a distance of twenty kilometres from the <b>dropping</b> <b>point,</b> crossing over a number of obstacles and performing combat operations (small arms fire and grenade throwing).|$|E

5000|$|The <b>dropping</b> <b>point</b> test {{procedures}} {{are given in}} ASTM standards D-566 and D-2265. [...] The test apparatus consists of a grease cup with a small hole in the bottom, test tube, two thermometers, a container, stirring device if required and an electric heater. The inside surfaces of the grease cup are coated with the grease to be tested. A thermometer is inserted into the cup and held in place so that the thermometer does not touch the grease. This assembly is placed inside a test tube. The test tube is lowered into the container which is filled with oil in D-566 and has an aluminum block in D-2265. Another thermometer is inserted into the oil/block.|$|E

50|$|For the Speed Bump, Ana Paula and Renata had to {{convince}} two people on the beach to be buried on the sand. Once both personswere buried, they could continue. In this Leg's Roadblock, one team member had to balance on a wakeboard for one minute, while dragged by a motorboat. When the team member completed one minute riding the wakeboard, the instructor would hand them their next clue. The Detour was a choice between Resistência (Resistance) and Ação (Action). In both options, teams had to wear a BOPE uniform. In Resistência, both team members had to undergo a BOPE resistance training, which included Abdominal exercises, Push-ups, Weight training, etc. In Ação, teams had to push a truck wheel and then carry a large bag to the <b>dropping</b> <b>point.</b> After finishing both options, teams had to climb a wall and ring a bell {{in order to receive}} their next clue from the hands of a BOPE member.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} was cancelled {{before it could}} begin, however, when Allied forces captured Dreux, the town which had been the planned <b>dropping</b> <b>point</b> for the airborne forces; General Eisenhower's fears that such an airborne operation would create a heavy burden on the limited ground transport available to the Allied forces {{also contributed to the}} decision to cancel the operation. Several more airborne operations were planned for First Allied Airborne Army in late August and early September, after the cancellation of Transfigure. Operation Boxer was concerned with the capture of Boulogne by the same forces as Transfigure was to have used, and Operation Linnet was to have used the Transfigure forces, with the addition of the 82nd Airborne Division, on 3 September to capture Tournai and create a bridgehead over the River Escaut, which would cut off a large number of retreating German formations in a similar manner to Transfigure. Both operations were cancelled, however, due to the rapid movement of Allied ground forces as they advanced through France and towards Belgium, as such a rapid advance did not allow First Allied Airborne Army enough time to plan an operation and deploy its forces before its objectives were overrun by ground forces. This situation changed, however, by the middle of September, as Allied forces came into contact with the German frontier and the Siegfried Line and encountered considerable German resistance, with German forces beginning to set up organized defensive positions and the Allied advance slowing.|$|E
40|$|Vegetable oils have {{significant}} {{potential as a}} base fluid and a substitute for mineral oil for grease formulation. The objective {{of this research is}} to produce grease from waste cooking oil via saponification of a stearic acid with a lithium hydroxide monohydrate, LiOH. In this research, preparation and formulation of bio-based grease and determination of optimum operating condition were studied. The produced bio-based grease is expected to have better performance, and apply in variety industry such as agriculture/farming, forestry applications and food processing. The stearic acid, lithium hydroxide monohydrate and waste cooking oil compositions were manipulated in this research. The operating temperature and mixing period were also studied. The characteristics of produced grease were analyzed in order to evaluate the performance of the grease. Among parameters analyzed were depth penetration test, <b>dropping</b> <b>point</b> and oxidation stability. While grease hardness was determined using depth penetration test, and their oxidative stabilities was determined using copper corrosion test. The <b>dropping</b> <b>point</b> temperature was tested using <b>dropping</b> <b>point</b> apparatus. Results indicate that the lithium hydroxide monohydrate, stearic acid and waste cooking oil content significantly affect grease hardness, oxidative stability and <b>dropping</b> <b>point</b> temperature. NLGI 2 (common grease) grease was formulated in this study with optimum condition...|$|E
