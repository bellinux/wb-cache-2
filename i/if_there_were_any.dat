5|$|Häyhänen, Fisher's former assistant, {{testified against}} {{him at the}} trial. The {{prosecution}} failed to find any other alleged members of Fisher's spy network, <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>any.</b> The jury retired {{for three and a}} half hours and returned on the afternoon of October 25, 1957, finding Fisher guilty on all three counts. On November 15, 1957, Judge Mortimer W. Byers imposed on Fisher a total sentence of thirty years and fines of three thousand dollars.|$|E
5|$|Reynolds did {{not believe}} there was time to make changes because, <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>any</b> delays in publication, the {{newspaper}} would not be published {{before the end of}} the school year. After consulting with his supervisors, he opted to publish a four-page newspaper instead of a six-page one, omitting the pages containing the two stories in question. Cutting two pages removed a total of seven articles from the paper. Reynolds did not tell the students about the decision, and they did not find out about it until the paper was delivered to the school.|$|E
5|$|Urobuchi {{stated that}} Sayaka was his {{favorite}} character overall, and remarked that her plotline was the most enjoyable to write. Due to her grim fate {{by the end of}} the series, a destiny that Shinbo believed was slightly unfair, he asked Urobuchi if it was possible to change the plot so that Sayaka could be spared. Urobuchi declined, asserting that her death was too integral to the overarching story. Shinbo then inquired <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>any</b> way that she could be brought back to life, admitting he had become very attached to the character. However, Urobuchi again refused, explaining that this would be impossible with regard to the already-established rules governing the story. Shinbo finally acquiesced to this, but remarked that he believed there may have been too large of a burden placed on the characters who were in essence young middle school girls.|$|E

25|$|In early August 2003, {{allegations}} arose concerning Dennehy's {{ability to}} remain with the Baylor basketball team during the 2002–2003 academic year without an athletic scholarship. Allegations of impropriety within the athletic department surfaced and university president Robert B. Sloan appointed an investigative panel to determine <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>any</b> potential NCAA violations at the school.|$|E
25|$|As before, {{with one}} exception, {{the goal was}} to {{identify}} seven tunes in thirty seconds to win the grand prize. The champion stopped the clock by hitting a buzzer, which was a cue for the band to stop playing, and could either give an answer or pass if he/she was not sure. Once all seven tunes were played, the champion went back to play the passed tunes <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>any.</b>|$|E

25|$|The interrogations were {{repeated}} every two weeks, but the interrogators compared notes to see <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>any</b> discrepancies. Refusing to answer questions, lying, disrespect to the interrogators, {{and a number}} of other infractions were punished by a beating with wooden clubs. Guards often beat prisoners or slapped them in the face for the slightest infraction, or at times at random. Officers typically faced harsher treatment than enlisted ranks. Inmates also claimed that Ōfuna guards were often sadistic, enjoying the beating and clubbing of inmates.|$|E
25|$|Bagri {{would later}} state before his later trial {{that he knew}} was {{probably}} a suspect by October 1985 but insisted he would have faced charges <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>any</b> evidence he {{had anything to do}} with the bombing. It was established by November that it was a man with a Sikh name who probably checked the bag in Vancouver that caused the crash. Parmar was not seen in Canada sometime after late 1986, as authorities believed him to be living in Pakistan where he continued operations against India.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>any</b> Frisii left in Frisia, {{they fell}} victim {{to the whims of}} nature, civil strife and piracy. After several hundred years of {{favorable}} conditions, the natural environment in the low-lying coastal regions of northwestern Europe began to deteriorate c. 250 AD and gradually worsened over the next 200 years. Rising sea levels and storm surges combined to flood some areas. Many deserted village sites were silted over. The situation was probably aggravated by a shift to a cooler, wetter climate in the region {{as well as by the}} introduction of malaria and other epidemic diseases.|$|E

25|$|As {{a pitcher}} in baseball's amateur era, Creighton changed the sport with his {{pitching}} style, from {{a game that}} showcased fielding into a confrontation between the pitcher and batter. During his era, a pitcher was required to deliver the ball in an underhand motion with a stiff arm/stiff wrist movement. The speed with which Creighton was able to pitch the ball had previously been thought of as impossible without movement of his elbow or wrist. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>any</b> movements in his elbow or wrist, they were imperceptible, but he was accused by some opponents and spectators of using an illegal delivery. However, the competitive advantage of this delivery, and his success as a pitcher, eventually led others to emulate his technique.|$|E
25|$|In this assessment, {{a person}} is asked to select a card from a deck with {{different}} mandalas (designs enclosed in a geometric shape) and then must choose a color from a set of colored cards. The person is then asked to draw the mandala from the card they choose with an oil pastel {{of the color of}} their choice. The artist is then asked to explain <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>any</b> meanings, experiences, or related information related to the mandala they drew. This test is based on the beliefs of Joan Kellogg, who sees a recurring correlation between the images, pattern and shapes in the mandalas that people draw and the personalities of the artists. This test assesses and gives clues to a person's psychological progressions and their current psychological condition (Malchiodi 1998).|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{thereafter}} {{the local}} sheriff and local residents {{arrived at the}} scene of the crash. The thrust from the still-idling jet engine allowed the aircraft to slowly drift on its belly along a field. The sheriff, having contacted the air base, was informed that he should simply allow the jet to run out of fuel, which occurred an hour and forty-five minutes later without further incident. A recovery crew from McClellan Air Force Base arrived on the scene and began to dismantle the aircraft, removing its wings for transport aboard a railroad flat car. The damage to the aircraft was minimal; indeed, one officer on the recovery crew is reported to have stated that <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>any</b> less damage he would have simply flown the aircraft out of the field.|$|E

25|$|From the navy's {{inception}} in 1941, there were concerns about sailors' pay and conditions. By {{the end of}} World War II, naval pay was well behind equivalent ranks in the New Zealand Army and the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and much lower than wages for equivalent jobs in the civilian sector. Sailors were forced to accept this instead of seeking work elsewhere, as they had enlisted for set periods during the war; some were required to complete twelve years service. Following the war's end, a review of pay was initiated. During his 1943 re-election campaign, Prime Minister Peter Fraser promised that new pay scales would be established by 1 April 1946; <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>any</b> delays, the pay rates would be backdated, and the sailors would receive the difference as a lump sum.|$|E
25|$|Battle Action Tanks: This {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular rides at Motorworld, and it was {{featured}} prominently in the television ads. In a chainlink fence-enclosed area, small tanks could be driven around, for a fee, for five minutes at a time, with tennis ball cannons that enabled riders to shoot at a sensor prominently mounted on each tank. If hit, the tank stopped operating for 15 seconds, while other tankers often took advantage of the delay to pepper the stricken vehicle with more fire. Visitors on the outside could also join in the fun through less costly cannons mounted on the inside of the fence. When workers had to enter the cage to attend to a stuck or crashed tank, which usually happened several times a day, they were often pelted with tennis balls from every direction despite prohibitions against such behavior that could result in expulsion from the park. This gave the tank ride a reputation for being more dangerous for the employees than the patrons, making it the least popular place to work in the park. It is not known <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>any</b> serious injuries from the tank ride. As of 2012, the area has not been redeveloped and only a vacant lot remains.|$|E

500|$|Wiesenthal {{spent time}} {{at his office}} at the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime in Vienna even as he {{approached}} his ninetieth birthday. The last Nazi he had a hand in bringing to trial was Untersturmführer Julius Viel, who was convicted in 2001 of shooting seven Jewish prisoners. Cyla died on 10 November 2003, at age 95. Wiesenthal retired shortly afterward. [...] "I have survived them all. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>any</b> left, they'd be too old and weak to stand trial today.

500|$|Dylan's {{performances}} in China in April 2011 generated controversy. Some criticised {{him for not}} making any explicit comment on the political situation in China, and for, allegedly, allowing the Chinese authorities to censor his set list. Others defended Dylan's performances, arguing that such criticism represented a misunderstanding of Dylan's art, and that no evidence for the censorship of Dylan's set list existed. In response to these allegations, Dylan posted a statement on his website: [...] "As far as censorship goes, the Chinese government had asked for {{the names of the}} songs that I would be playing. There's no logical answer to that, so we sent them the set lists from the previous 3 months. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>any</b> songs, verses or lines censored, nobody ever told me about it and we played all the songs that we intended to play." ...|$|E
