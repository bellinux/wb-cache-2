50|$|Fine {{pulverized}} coal exits the outlet section through multiple discharge coal pipes {{leading to the}} burners, while oversized coal particles are rejected {{and returned to the}} grinding zone for further grinding.Pyrites and extraneous dense impurity material fall through the nozzle ring and are plowed, by scraper blades attached to the grinding table, into the pyrites chamber to be removed.Mechanically, the vertical roller mill is categorized as an applied force mill. There are three grinding roller wheel assemblies in the mill grinding section, which are mounted on a loading frame via pivot point.The fixed-axis roller in each roller wheel assembly rotates on a segmentally-lined grinding table that is supported and driven by a planetary <b>gear</b> <b>reducer</b> direct-coupled to a motor. The grinding force for coal pulverization is applied by a loading frame. This frame is connected by vertical tension rods to three hydraulic cylinders secured to the mill foundation. All forces used in the pulverizing process are transmitted to the foundation via the <b>gear</b> <b>reducer</b> and loading elements. The pendulum movement of the roller wheels provides a freedom for wheels to move in a radial direction, which results in no radial loading against the mill housing during the pulverizing process.|$|E

50|$|What is {{commonly}} referred to as microstepping is often sine-cosine microstepping in which the winding current approximates a sinusoidal AC waveform. Sine-cosine microstepping is the most common form, but other waveforms can be used. Regardless of the waveform used, as the microsteps become smaller, motor operation becomes more smooth, thereby greatly reducing resonance in any parts the motor may be connected to, as well as the motor itself.

Majority of drive elements like <b>gear</b> <b>reducers,</b> lead screws {{and host of}} other components are driven by shaft that is supported by multiple bearings. Due to rigidity of coupling, slight misalignments will be there between a driving and driven shaft.
