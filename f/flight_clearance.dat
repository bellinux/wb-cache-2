This {{is a violation of}} the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations (CASR). The airport briefing office should sign the <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> and therefore supervise the process. In Pioneer Flight operations, the local government requires the operator to hire local businesses/human resources in the operation, such as for the ticket agents, suppliers, etc. Dirgantara Air Service Area Manager in Samarinda mentioned that in many cases, the local personnel are not qualified or do {{not have the right to}} work in airline operation, but have to be hired anyway. This might influence the safety level of the operation. The {{investigation found}} that there were two load manifests. The original manifest, obtained by the police at Tenggarong District and was suspected to be from Datah Dawai, listed seven adults, one child, and one infant with several items of baggage. The second manifest, numbered 012905, is suspected to have been made in Samarinda. The number on the top right of the document is pasted over, obviously to cover the document's real number. The manifest stated that there were eight adults, two children, and two infants aboard the aircraft and no baggage. This is a gross violation of aviation safety procedures that can be classified as willful misconduct if not considered as criminal act.|$|E

50|$|The {{distance}} {{by which}} an aircraft avoids obstacles or other aircraft is termed separation. The most important concept of IFR flying is that separation is maintained regardless of weather conditions. In controlled airspace, {{air traffic control}} (ATC) separates IFR aircraft from obstacles and other aircraft using a <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> based on route, time, distance, speed, and altitude. ATC monitors IFR flights on radar, or through aircraft position reports in areas where radar coverage is not available. Aircraft position reports are sent as voice radio transmissions. In the United States, a flight operating under IFR is required to provide position reports unless ATC advises a pilot that the plane is in radar contact. The pilot must resume position reports after ATC advises that radar contact has been lost, or that radar services are terminated.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, the F-14 Tomcat didn't have {{clearance}} to drop bombs {{even though all}} Tomcats were built with a Stores Management System (SMS) that included air-to-ground options as well as rudimentary software in the AWG-9. Early <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> work to clear the aircraft for air-to-ground were suspended due to development delays with the F-14 and it being shifted away from the air to ground mission. At the time, the Tomcat was so expensive (and lacked proper defensive electronic countermeasures (DECM) and radar homing and warning (RHAW) for overland operations) that the Navy {{did not want to}} risk it in the air-to-ground role. However, the TARPS mission had proven the Tomcat was survivable overland and upgrades to the Tomcat's DECM, expendables and RHAW gear were developed to increase its survivability. With the end of the Cold War and de-emphasis on the Fleet Air Defense mission, NAVAIR had renewed <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> work before Desert Storm so the F-14 could carry gravity bombs as well as laser-guided bombs if the target was lased by another jet (first Tomcat LGB drop in combat was made by VF-41 in 1995 during operations over Bosnia with an A-6 Intruder providing the requisite target illumination). Meanwhile, the decision had been made by OPNAV to retire the A-6 altogether and allow the F-14 Block 1 Strike variant to take over as the precision strike platform for the air wing. However, the $1.6B Block 1 Strike program was canceled in budgetary cuts by 1994 with only enough funding to integrate the JDAM, which was years away. In late 1994, an unsolicited proposal from Martin Marietta was initiated to demonstrate how a USAF LANTIRN targeting pod could be rapidly integrated onto the Tomcat. This effort was done under the auspices of COMNAVAIRLANT using a fleet aircraft to integrate the digital 1553-based pod on an analog F-14B. In March 1995 a VF-103 fleet aircraft successfully dropped the first laser-guided training rounds (LGTR) and quickly laser-guided bombs (LGB). Due to the early success and interest from Fleet Commanders, NAVAIR began to procure pods and control units for deployment, resulting in VF-103 receiving the first LANTIRN pod June 14, 1996 in time for its upcoming deployment.|$|E

An abandoned World War II runway at a village near Kolar played host to the first ever flight of this indigenous rotary engine-powered UAV. The flight took off on early Sunday morning and climbed to an altitude of 1.8 km before cruising for a duration of 35 minutes. The air vehicle was recovered safely at the intended place at a dried-up lake, after a total flight duration of 40 min. The engine, a Wankel rotary type, was the developmental project of the DRDO and was jointly designed and developed by NAL, a CSIR laboratory, VRDE, Ahmednagar and ADE, Bangalore. The provisional <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> for the first indigenous prototype engine was given by the certifying agency, the Regional Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification. The engine was cleared for flight after rigorous ground endurance test runs. The Wankel engine weighs about 30 kg (70 lb), and this engine type is known for its high power-to-weight ratio in a single rotor category.|$|E

40|$|Before a new {{flight control}} system is {{released}} for flight, {{a huge number of}} simulations are evaluated to find weaknesses of the system. This process is called <b>flight</b> <b>clearance.</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>clearance</b> is a very important but time consuming process. There is a need of better <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> methods {{and one of the most}} promising methods is the use of optimization. In this thesis the <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> of a simulation model of JAS 39 Gripen is examined. Two <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> algorithms using two different optimization methods are evaluated and compared to each other and to a traditional <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> method. In this thesis the <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> process is separated into three cases: search for the worst flight condition, search for the worst manoeuvre and search for the worst flight condition including parameter uncertainties. For all cases the optimization algorithms find a more dangerous case than the traditional method. In the search for worst flight condition, both with and without uncertainties, the optimization algorithms are to prefer to the traditional method with respect to the clearance results and the number of objective function calls. The search for the worst manoeuvre is a much more complex problem. Even as the algorithms find more dangerous manoeuvres than the traditional method, it is not certain that they find the worst manoeuvres. If not other methods should be used the problem has to be rephrased. For example other optimization variables or a few linearizations of the optimization problem could reduce the complexity. The overall impression is that the need of information and problem characteristics define which method that is most suitable to use. The information required must be weighed against the cost of objective function calls. Compared to the traditional method, the optimization methods used in this thesis give extended information about the problems examined and are better to locate the worst case...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{main goal}} of <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> {{is to use}} the {{structured}} singular value (μ) analysis of the flight control system when some parameters in the system vary in a certain range.

In this paper, based on the introduction of basic theory of LFT andμ-analysis, an X-fighter is chosen as an example to utilize the proposed methods. In order to realize the <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> process automatically, a novel software package based on MATLAB programming language is developed.

The analysis employs a typical nonlinear clearance criterion used by the European aerospace industry together with a detailed simulation model of a high performance aircraft with a full authority control law. The deterministic optimisation algorithm used in the study is Dividing RECTangles (DIRECT), while the evolutionary algorithm is Differential Evolution. Both algorithms are hybridised with local gradient- based optimisation methods to improve convergence rates near the global solution. The reliability, computational complexity and efficiency of the two approaches are compared for this realistic engineering example, and the prospects for application of optimisation-based methods in the industrial <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> process are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to identify and evaluate promising mathematical techniques for re-entry <b>flight</b> <b>clearance.</b> To fulfil this objective, two mathematical methods were investigated and developed: μ analysis for linear models and interval analysis for both linear and non-linear models. The stability of re-entry vehicles {{in the presence of}} model uncertainties was chosen as the clearance criterion, which is represented by two mathematical criteria: worst-case eigenvalues (linear) and the Lyapunov stability (non-linear). Two vehicle models including flight control systems were developed and used as case studies for the evaluation of the clearance techniques. These models are based on the DART (Delft Aerospace Re-entry Test Demonstrator) and SPHYNX (Subscale Precursor Hypersonic X) re-entry vehicle models. The suitability of the two mathematical techniques for re-entry <b>flight</b> <b>clearance</b> was evaluated {{based on the results of}} the clearance application on these models. Non-linear simulations were also performed to verify the clearance results generated by the two techniques. Non-linear interval analysis has been found to be the most reliable method of all other methods investigated in this research, because it could perform the clearance for the non-linear dynamic models of the re-entry vehicles with uncertainties, and the results were confirmed by the non-linear simulations.

40|$|The limited {{capacity}} available at airports regularly {{leads to an}} imbalance between supply and demand at busier airports. It is the runway systems at such airports which often set limitations {{on the number of}} possible <b>flight</b> <b>clearances.</b> In addition, existing systems of regulation sometimes use strategic resource allocation as a condition for access to specific infrastructure, as for instance the airport slot allocation in accordance with EU Regulation 95 / 93 and its amendments in Europe. These regulation systems do indeed restrict the number of demanded slots to a level which the capacity can, on average, handle, but this alone cannot prevent unnecessary waiting times before customers are served. One reason for this can be temporary fluctuations in the capacity on offer (e. g. due to weather influences) and another is deviations from the forecast demand (e. g. due to delayed departures or short-notice changes to flight routes of an aircraft). Today’s system applies a first-in-first-out system in allocating runway capacity to demand in the form of planned flights. In order to treat all flights equally, deficits in utilization of the available slots are accepted. The concept presented in this Paper allows user-driven priorities to be set and true-to-schedule user behaviour to be promoted. It furthermore enables prioritization of high-profitability <b>flights</b> during <b>clearance</b> in cases where there are capacity deficits. We show which runway system prioritization is suitable in aviation to increase efficiency in resource utilization. We present KPIs which would be required by an airport to make this effect appropriately measurable...|$|R
