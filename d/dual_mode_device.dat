50|$|This {{technology}} {{is of interest}} to users {{as an example of}} the benefits that are achievable through Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC). Since most WiFi and WiMAX access points will use fixed backhaul technologies, seamlessly moving between for example WiFi and GSM domains allows the best quality and most cost efficient radio to be used at any given point in time, irrespective of the transport technology used for the media. Similarly, service providers are interested in VCC in order to offer FMC products towards specific market segments, such as enterprise users. Cellular operators in particular can offer bundled services that consist of for example, a broadband connection with a WiFi router and a set of <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> <b>devices.</b> This supports a Fixed Mobile Substitution (FMS) business case where calls from the office can be carried as VoIP over WiFi and a broadband connection, while VCC technology allows these calls to be seamlessly handed over to cellular networks as the device moves to areas of poor WiFi coverage.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — One of {{the main}} issues for a {{wireless}} mesh network is concerned of how to increase its capacity. Many research groups have focused on utilizing multi-channel multi-interface technologies on this purpose. In general, each interface in a mesh device is configured {{as one of the}} two modes: backbone mode for supporting a backbone connectivity and access point (AP) mode for supporting client connectivity. However, these two modes cannot be activated on the same interface simultaneously, restricting the capacity of the mesh network and degrading the overall network performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose the novel mesh architecture based on IEEE 802. 11 s and evaluate its performance via implementing a <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> mesh <b>device</b> on actual testbeds...|$|R

With controlling the gain saturation condition, different oscillating states can be observed. The nonlinear dynamics characteristics including bifurcation of the laser under optical injection with two different start-up sequences are analyzed with numerical simulations. Furthermore, we investigate the lasing wavelength bistability of the laser combined with its tuning characteristics theoretically.

40|$|Abstract—With the multi-fold {{development}} in communication technology, {{there has been}} a rapid growth in consumption of multimedia services using mobile devices. In particular, lots of research has been done to provide multimedia services using a 3 G/WLAN <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> to mobile <b>device</b> users. All users download contents from content providers through cellular networks and can share their contents with their neighbors. However, we believe that selfish users (or users with limited resources) are not willing to cooperate or share their contents with other users. In this paper, we propose an incentive scheme that gives the benefit of contents sharing to users in a 3 G/WLAN <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> supporting network. There are two types of users: premium users and ordinary users. Premium users can get high quality contents at the expense of spending their own money and resources of power and bandwidth, while ordinary users receive plain quality contents freely or with paying little amount of money. Our incentive mechanism designs the content provider to offer each premium user a discounted price for downloading high quality contents. Through our approach, each premium user will receive some incentive of a discounted price for receiving high quality contents in proportion to the contribution to the content provider. By doing so, the content provider can increase its total utility too. Our simulation results confirm that our proposed incentive scheme performs well. I...|$|R
40|$|SentreHEART, an {{innovator}} in catheter {{technology for}} tissue closure, {{has built a}} device to ligate the left atrial appendage. This device is a noninvasive instrument that utilizes a balloon catheter-based system that only requires a small needle access instead of open heart surgery. The left atrial appendage {{has been known to}} cause be a location of thrombus formation in patients with atrial fibrillation, {{the most common form of}} heart arrhythmia. Fifteen percent of those who have had strokes have also had atrial fibrillation Needle access is made in the patient and the catheter is fed through the vein with a guide wire. A balloon filled with fluorescent contrast is fed along the guide wire, positioned at the appendage, and then inflated to signify the location of the catheter. On the outside of the left atrial appendage, a separate guide wire with the LARIAT Suture Delivery Device, which is comparative to a lasso, is fed through another needle access site until it meets the existing guidewire within the appendage. Both guidewires are then connected using the FindrWIRZ Magnetic Guide Wire System. The connection is accomplished magnetically with magnets that are located at the end of both guidewires. The balloon is then inflated once more and then the surgeon wraps the suture around the left atrial appendage and inflated balloon, which then successfully ligates the left atrial appendage. The balloon is then deflated and the device can be removed from the body. With this procedure, patients are typically discharged the next day. Our senior design project focuses on the problem of delivering the contrast to the balloon during surgery preparation. The balloon is repeatedly inflated and then deflated with contrast until all of the air has been evacuated from the system. If all bubbles are not removed during preparation, the bubbles inside of the device create a potential risk of stroke if the balloon bursts and the air bubbles escape the device and then travel into the bloodstream. The contrast preparation for the current device, the EndoCATH Large Occlusion Balloon, is long and tedious when compared to existing balloon catheters. The preparation of the device is currently the largest complaint among nurses. Currently, the balloon catheter is prepared by repeatedly inflating and then deflating the balloon with contrast until all of the air bubbles are eliminated from the dual-lumen device. One lumen was used for the guidewire, and the second lumen was used for contrast. For our senior design project we proposed a <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> tri-lumen <b>device.</b> Through a y-arm modification we have enabled the device to work in both a preparation mode and an inflation/deflation mode. The preparation mode provides continuous flow of the contrast to the balloon to prohibit the formation of bubbles, which significantly decreased the time required for preparation. The inflation/deflation mode allows for both lumens to be used simultaneously for inflation and deflation. This essentially reverts the device back to how it functioned as the dual-lumen <b>device.</b> With both <b>modes,</b> the <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> tri-lumen <b>device</b> has significantly decreased preparation time while maintaining existing inflation/deflation times...|$|R

40|$|This interpretive {{qualitative}} study investigated why open and distance learning (ODL) within some <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> universities seemingly {{failed to achieve}} high participation rates, compared to the face-to-face mode of delivery in the same institution. Its scope was the Botswana higher education sector. The University of Botswana (UB), the only public <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> university in Botswana, was closely studied. The main question explored why some <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> universities in southern Africa enrolled lower figures through ODL than the face-to-face mode of delivery, though ODL had more potential to increase access substantially than the face-to-face mode. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Purposive selection drew participants from UB, the Tertiary Education Council (TEC) and the Ministry of Education and Skills Development (MOESD), based on their experience in education planning, policy formulation and ODL delivery. Data were analysed through qualitative content analysis. The study confirmed internal and external attitudes that create equivalency challenges and impede ODL growth in <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> universities, resulting in its limited contribution to participation. It established that <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> institutions need relevant policies, structures and enhanced resources for ODL, in order to significantly increase participation. The study consequently advocates thorough planning for a <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> setup, commitment of resources, monitored implementation and appropriately trained staff. gv 201...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAIM: To compare muscle {{activity}} of lower limb muscles between <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> whole-body vibration (WBV) and the commonly used side-alternating mode. METHODS: Thirty physically active volunteers performed static squats at a knee angle of 60 ° (0 °: knee fully extended) on the WBV platform while surface electromyography (sEMG) was measured of the vastus lateralis (VL), the biceps femoris (BF), and the soleus (SOL). The side-alternating WBV trial was induced at a frequency of 6 Hz and an amplitude (displacement from baseline to peak) of 2. 5 mm. <b>Dual</b> <b>mode</b> WBV consisted of side-alternating vibration with additional circular vibration in the horizontal plane with frequencies of 14 Hz and 43 Hz. Root mean {{square of the}} sEMG signals (sEMGRMS) was calculated after withdrawal of the excessive spikes in the sEMG spectrum via linear interpolation. Then, sEMGRMS was normalized to the sEMGRMS during maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs). Finally, sEMGRMS during a control trial without vibration was subtracted from the trials with WBV in order to isolate the increase in muscle activity due to the vibration. RESULTS: Increase in sEMGRMS of the VL and BF was significantly greater during <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> compared to side-alternating WBV when the <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> trial consisted of the high circular frequency (43 Hz, P < 0. 01, Figure 1). In the SOL, the <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> enhanced muscle activity significantly compared to the side-alternating mode for both circular vibration frequencies (14 Hz, 43 Hz, P < 0. 01, Figure 1). CONCLUSION: <b>Dual</b> <b>mode</b> WBV resulted in significantly higher muscle activity in select lower limb muscles than the commonly used side-alternating mode. Therefore, {{it is recommended that}} <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> platforms be considered for future WBV protocols in order to optimize the training stimulus in the lower limbs...|$|R
