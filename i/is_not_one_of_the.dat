25|$|Immunization {{against the}} {{pathogens}} that cause diarrheal {{disease is a}} viable prevention strategy, however it does require targeting certain pathogens for vaccination. In the case of Rotavirus, which was responsible for around 6% of diarrheal episodes and 20% of diarrheal disease deaths in the children of developing countries, use of a Rotavirus vaccine in trials in 1985 yielded a slight (2-3%) decrease in total diarrheal disease incidence, while reducing overall mortality by 6-10%. Similarly, a Cholera vaccine showed a strong reduction in morbidity and mortality, though the overall impact of vaccination was minimal as Cholera <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major causative pathogens of diarrheal disease. Since this time, more effective vaccines have been developed that {{have the potential to}} save many thousands of lives in developing nations, while reducing the overall cost of treatment, and the costs to society.|$|E

25|$|Mark Tauber, senior {{vice-president}} of HarperOne, {{has stated that}} the Green Bible was developed {{with the intention of}} being “the first ever specialty bible that takes the issues of sustainability, stewardship of the earth, what many in the religious community call ‘creation care’ very seriously”. He went further, exposing on the Green Bible’s purpose: “That the Bible has a profound message of sustainability—some might argue, the original message—is not all that surprising. What is surprising is that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first things that comes to mind when most folks think about the Bible and its message... this Bible seeks to change that fact. We believe that the unique and specially added features by some of today's most important thinkers, writers and leaders, across the ecumenical spectrum make it a must-have for those who already find motivation, comfort and inspiration in it and for the many more who might see it freshly as a critical resource in their journey to sustain our planet”.|$|E
25|$|The present Eritrean Jewish {{community}} {{is believed to}} be started by Yemenite Jews from Yemen attracted by new commercial opportunities driven by Italian colonial expansion in the late 19th Century. The Jewish population then later increased from European refugees coming to Eritrea to escape the anti-Semitic regimes in Europe at the time. Many returned to Israel in 1948. During British administration, Eritrea was often used as a location of exile for Irgun and Lehi guerrillas. Among those imprisoned was future Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Shamir and Haim Corfu, a founder of Beitar Jerusalem. In 1961 the Eritrean War of Independence began after Eritrea was annexed by Ethiopia. It was then that Jews began to leave Eritrea. In the early 1970s, Jewish emigration increased because of ensuing violence between Eritrea and Ethiopia (up to and beyond Eritrea's official declaration of independence in 1993). Judaism <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four religions recognized by the Eritrean government and indeed, as of 2006 there was only one last native Jew left in Eritrea - Sami Cohen, who attends to the Asmara Synagogue and cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Rugby League {{is a minor}} {{sport in}} Scotland, with the country never having had a {{professional}} club. Participation in rugby league has increased though, with a Scottish division in the Rugby League Conference with seven teams, including four in the Glasgow/West Scotland area having formed in 2006. But, unlike in England, rugby league <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ten most played sports in Scotland amongst adults. Junior development has been much more rapid, with several Conference teams having junior squads {{as well as other}} clubs who don't run an open-age squad having various junior squads. An estimated 2,500 children play rugby league in Scotland, with that figure growing to 12,500 when you add the amount of children who play the sport in various school programmes. In terms of media coverage, apart from Challenge Cup matches rugby league is not shown on Scottish terrestrial television and no matches are usually broadcast on radio. However, Scotland international matches usually get reported in national newspapers like The Scotsman and sometimes in Scottish editions of London-based newspapers.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the further}} {{explanations}} of Xiong's student Mou Zongsan, Heaven {{is not merely}} sky, and just like the God of the Judaic and Hellenistic-Christian tradition <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beings in the world. However, unlike the God of these religions, the God of Confucianism is not outside the world either, but is within humans, which is the primary concern of Confucianism, and other beings in the world. Tian is the ontological substance of reality, is immanent in every human being as the human nature (ren), but the human being on the phenomenal level is not identical with its metaphysical essence. Mencius stated that «the one who can fully realize one's heart/mind can understand one's nature, {{and the one who}} can understand one's own nature can know Tian»; Tian is within us, but before we fulfill our heart/mind and know our nature, Heaven still appears transcendent to us. Mou cites Max Muller that «a human being itself is potentially a God, a God one presently ought to become» to reflect th idea of the relationship of God and humanity in Confucianism and other Eastern religions. What is crucial is to transcend the phenomenon to reach Tian.|$|E

[...] Compared to its Palladian contemporaries, such as Holkham Hall, Woburn Abbey and Ragley Hall, it is quite small, yet it is architecturally important as it encapsulates a period of 18th-century English social history, when young men, known as dilettanti, returning from the nearly obligatory Grand Tour with newly purchased acquisitions of art, often built a country house to accommodate their collections and display in stone the learning and culture they had acquired on their travels.|$|E

500|$|Several writers {{felt that}} the novel left much to be desired {{following}} Fitzgerald's previous works and promptly criticized him.

[...] John McClure of The Times-Picayune said that the book was unconvincing, writing, [...] "Even in conception and construction, The Great Gatsby seems a little raw." [...] Ralph Coghlan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch felt the book lacked what made Fitzgerald's earlier novels endearing and called the book [...] "a minor performance... At the moment, its author seems a bit bored and tired and cynical." [...] Ruth Snyder of New York Evening World called the book's style [...] "painfully forced", noting that the editors of the paper were [...] "quite convinced after reading The Great Gatsby that Mr. Fitzgerald <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great American writers of to-day." [...] The reviews struck Fitzgerald as completely missing the point: [...] "All the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about." ...|$|E
