5|$|A federal {{government}} is only sensible, for Russell, when it has limited but well-defined powers. Russell advocates {{the creation of a}} world government made up of sovereign nation-states (Russell 1938:197, 230–31). On his view, the function of a world government should only be to ensure the avoidance of war and the pursuit of peace (Russell 1938:230-31). On the world stage, democracy would be impossible, because of the negligible power any particular individual could <b>have</b> <b>in</b> comparison with the entire human race.|$|E
5|$|Although Athenian {{women were}} not legally {{permitted}} to dispose of large sums of money, they frequently had large dowries which supported them throughout their lives. Income from a dowry could be significant. The larger a woman's dowry relative to her husband's wealth, the more influence she was likely to <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the household since she retained the dowry if the couple divorced. Athenian women could also acquire property by inheritance {{if they were the}} closest surviving relative, but could not contractually acquire or dispose of property.|$|E
5|$|Although in most cacti, {{the stem}} {{acts as the}} main organ for storing water, some cacti <b>have</b> <b>in</b> {{addition}} large taproots. These may be several times {{the length of the}} above-ground body in the case of species such as Copiapoa atacamensis, which grows in one of the driest places in the world, the Atacama Desert in northern Chile.|$|E

5000|$|One of Heroldrebe's {{drawbacks}} is {{its relatively}} late ripening; it is harvested {{at about the}} same time as Pinot noir. Heroldrebe was grown on a total of 155 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> Germany in 2008, with a decreasing trend. There were 99 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> Palatinate, 32 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> Rheinhessen, and 23 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> Württemberg. In Palatinate it is typically used to produce light, almost pinkish, colored wines.|$|R
5|$|But the WFM's {{success at}} Cripple Creek {{also created a}} {{significant}} backlash. The WFM was forever tarred as a dangerous and violent organization {{in the eyes of}} employers. Never again would the WFM <b>have</b> <b>in</b> a local strike the level of public support it enjoyed at Cripple Creek in 1894. Indeed, when the union struck the Cripple Creek mines again in 1898, its public support ended after violence broke out. During another strike in 1903–4, whose violent significance earned it the name Colorado Labor Wars, the union went up against the power of the employers and the state combined.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun {{is often}} held in high regard by the Southern Lost Cause historians, who hold a romanticized {{view of the}} old Southern {{way of life and}} its cause during the Civil War. Historians such as Charles M. Wiltse, Margaret Coit, and Clyde N. Wilson <b>have,</b> <b>in</b> their writings, portrayed Calhoun as a {{sympathetic}} or heroic figure.|$|E
5|$|Culturally, Black Sabbath have exerted a huge {{influence}} in both television and literature and <b>have</b> <b>in</b> many cases {{become synonymous with}} heavy metal. In the film Almost Famous, Lester Bangs gives the protagonist an assignment to cover the band (plot point one) with the immortal line: 'Give me 500 words on Black Sabbath'. Contemporary music and arts publication Trebuchet Magazine has put this to practice by asking all new writers to write a short piece (500 words) on Black Sabbath {{as a means of}} proving their creativity and voice on a well documented subject.|$|E

50|$|Freshwater {{carp farming}} {{is the major}} {{aquaculture}} activity in Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

5|$|Due to {{successive}} remodelings and enlargements {{the architecture}} at Ashton Court {{is complex and}} seldom what it seems. The core of the house, a 15th-century manor, has been obliterated by later wings, which <b>have</b> <b>in</b> turn been remodelled and altered, most substantially around 1635. Therefore, the plan of the house has evolved as irregular with many juxtapositions and little cohesion; {{while the majority of}} the house was built in the 17th century, a time of classical architecture, remodelling and alteration to the fenestration has created an overall Gothic appearance.|$|E
5|$|Dyrwood is cursed by the Hollowborn Plague: {{children}} are being born without souls, leaving them totally unresponsive in a way similar to a permanent vegetative state. Many people blame animancers, the scientists who study and manipulate souls. Investigating the curse, the Watcher discovers that the Hollowborns' souls <b>have</b> <b>in</b> fact been stolen by a cult known as the Leaden Key, led by a priest named Thaos, and that Thaos is framing animancers for the Plague. This eventually leads to a riot {{in the capital city}} where animancers are lynched and their college is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Finds from sites outside England, {{especially}} in France, <b>have</b> <b>in</b> {{the nineteenth and}} twentieth century been referred to M. bucklandii. In 2010 Benson considered these as either clearly different or too fragmentary to establish an identity. In 2014, fossils from the Philippines were identified as dinosaurian in nature, and American palaeontologist John J. Flynn suspected that they belonged to Megalosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Finkelstein's {{books are}} {{an attempt to}} examine the works of {{mainstream}} scholarship. The authors whose work he has thus targeted, including Daniel Jonah Goldhagen and Dershowitz, along with others such as Benny Morris whose work Finkelstein has also cited in his scholarship, <b>have</b> <b>in</b> turn accused Finkelstein of grossly misrepresenting their work, and selectively quoting from their books.|$|E
5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana is {{the type}} species of {{subgenus}} Caroliniana of genus Gyromitra. This grouping comprises species that <b>have,</b> <b>in</b> maturity, coarsely reticulate ascospores (i.e., with a network of ridges on the surface) with multiple blunt spines that originate from the reticulum on the spores. Other species in this subgenus include G.fastigiata and the central European species G.parma. In 1969, Erich Heinz Benedix believed that the spore reticulation was sufficiently unique to be worthy of designation as a separate genus, and he described Fastigiella to contain G.caroliniana. Harri Harmaja disagreed, later placing Fastigiella in synonymy with Gyromitra.|$|E

50|$|In Romania rice {{production}} {{began in}} the 1970s when the president Nicolae Ceauşescu, after visits to China and North Korea, forced peasants and convicts to cultivate and work rice fields located in South-Eastern Romania in Vlădeni commune.

Total cultivated land reached 49000 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> 1989 but dropped dramatically between 2000 and 2003 to 500 <b>ha.</b> <b>In</b> 2003 several companies realized the potential growth of this crop in Romania and the cultivated surface started to rise from year to year to 1200 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> 2004 to 5600 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> 2006 and to 12900 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> 2009.|$|R

5|$|Many {{risk factors}} and {{protective}} factors have been proposed, sometimes in relation to theories concerning possible mechanisms of the disease, however, none have been conclusively related to PD by empirical evidence. When epidemiological studies {{have been carried out}} in order to test the relationship between a given factor and PD, they have often been flawed and their results <b>have</b> <b>in</b> some cases been contradictory. The most frequently replicated relationships are an increased risk of PD in those exposed to pesticides, and a reduced risk in smokers.|$|E
