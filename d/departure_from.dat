40|$|Viability {{selection}} {{influences the}} genotypic contexts of alleles {{and leads to}} quantifiable <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> Hardy-Weinberg proportions. One measure of these departures is Wright's inbreeding coefficient (F), where observed heterozygosity is compared with expected heterozygosity. Here, I extend population genetics theory to describe post-selection genotype frequencies in terms of post-selection allele frequencies and fitness dominance. The resulting equations correspond to non-equilibrium populations, allowing the following questions to be addressed: When selection is present, how large a sample size is needed to detect significant <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> Hardy-Weinberg? How do selection-induced <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> Hardy-Weinberg vary with allele frequencies and levels of fitness dominance? For realistic selection coefficients, large sample sizes are required and <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> Hardy-Weinberg proportions are small...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> multiple-locus Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is presented {{for a set}} of four tribal Indian groups (the Yanomama, Makiritare, Wapishana and Ticuna) from the lowlands of South America. These tribes span a range of agglomeration and acculturation from the most traditional, swidden horticulturalists to frontier townspeople. The small-group social organization typical of traditional horticulturalists leads to substantial <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> tribal panmixia, as manifested by the distribution of multiple-locus genotypes both within and between villages. Within villages, the <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> single-locus Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are small and nonsignificant, but the <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> gametic equilibrium (independence of loci) are substantial, even for the unlinked loci we have used to characterize these populations. The <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> single-locus homogeneity across villages are also substantial. One of the normal concomitants of increasing acculturation in this setting is an increase in agglomeration. As agglomeration increases, the <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> multiple-locus panmixia decrease, a process that can be very rapid. We discuss both the shifting balance theory of evolution and punctuated evolutionary rates in light of the small group social organization that must have obtained throughout most of human evolution...|$|R
50|$|Bartlett's test is {{sensitive}} to <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> normality. That is, if the samples come from non-normal distributions, then Bartlett's test may simply be testing for non-normality. Levene's test and the Brown-Forsythe test are alternatives to the Bartlett test that are less sensitive to <b>departures</b> <b>from</b> normality.|$|R
