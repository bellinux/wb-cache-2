5|$|Mr. Steinitz stands {{high as a}} {{theoretician}} and as a writer; he has {{a powerful}} pen, and when he chooses can use expressive English. He evidently strives {{to be fair to}} friends and foes alike, but appears sometimes to fail to see that after all he <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> many others in this respect. Possessed of a fine intellect, and extremely fond of the game, he is apt to lose sight of all other considerations, people and business alike. Chess is his very life and soul, the one thing for which he lives.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{brown creeper}} {{has never been}} {{recorded}} in Europe, but an autumn vagrant {{would be difficult to}} identify, since it would not be singing, and the American species' call <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> that of Eurasian treecreeper. In appearance, brown creeper is more like short-toed than Eurasian, but a vagrant might still not be possible to identify with certainty given the similarities between the three species.|$|E

5|$|The {{morphology}} of Proto-Central-Semitic shows {{significant changes}} compared with Proto-Semitic, especially in its verbs, and <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> in Classical Arabic. Nouns in the singular were usually declined in three cases: /-u/ (nominative), /-a/ (accusative) or /-i/ (genitive). In some circumstances (but {{never in the}} construct state), nouns also took a final nasal after the case ending: nunation (final /-n/) occurred in some languages, mimation (final /-m/) in others. The original meaning of this marker is uncertain. In Classical Arabic, final /-n/ on nouns indicates indefiniteness and disappears when the noun is preceded by a definite article or otherwise becomes definite in meaning. In other languages, final /-n/ may be present whenever a noun {{is not in the}} construct state. Old Canaanite had mimation, of uncertain meaning, in an occurrence of the word urušalemim (Jerusalem) as given in an Egyptian transcription.|$|E

25|$|The city's climate <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> that of {{its large}} {{neighboring}} city, Chicago. The city experiences hot summers and cold winters, with temperatures slightly more extreme than those of closer suburbs, because rural land still surrounds the city.

High temperatures are usually comparable to those in Chicago, with only a few degrees difference on most days.|$|E

All underlying goals are consistent across the organization. Its American segment retains formality and authority amongst members and the organization.

25|$|In other Lutheran churches, {{the process}} <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> the Post-Vatican II revised rite of the Roman Catholic Church.

The people process to the front in lines and receive the Eucharist standing. Following this, the people make {{the sign of the}} cross (if they choose to) and return to their places in the congregation.|$|E
25|$|The Winchester Model 1907 is a blowback-operated, {{semi-automatic}} rifle {{produced by the}} Winchester Repeating Arms Company beginning in 1906 with production ending in 1958. It fired a cartridge of intermediate power (roughly equivalent in energy to the 7.62x39), cycled through a semi-automatic operating mechanism, fed by a detachable magazine. It was fed from a 5, 10, or 15 round detachable box magazine located immediately forward of the trigger guard. In size and handling, it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> an M1 carbine, though the 1907 is heavier and fires a much harder hitting round.|$|E
