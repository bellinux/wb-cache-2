5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{developed into}} Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 3, 115mi (185km/h) east of Dominica. The depression rapidly intensified into a tropical storm, and {{was classified as}} Tropical Storm Klaus only six hours later. Because Klaus was {{in an area of}} weak steering current, it was drifting west-northwestward. On October 5, Klaus briefly intensified into a hurricane, and passed only 12mi (19km) east of Barbuda later that <b>day.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> following day, Klaus had weakened back into a tropical storm. After weakening to a tropical storm, Klaus began to accelerate, while turning westward. Klaus became significantly affected by wind shear, as it weakened to a tropical depression to the north of Puerto Rico on October 8. Later that day, deep convection began to re-developed near the low-level circulation of Klaus, and it had re-intensified into a tropical storm. As Klaus tracked northwestward near the Bahamas on October 9, it was absorbed by an area of low pressure, which would eventually develop into Tropical Storm Marco.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this growth, on 9 April 2006 the OCC began to include {{download}} sales alongside physical sales when compiling the UK Albums Chart. That same day, the OCC also launched a dedicated weekly chart based solely on sales of album downloads in the UK. Approximately 64,000 albums were downloaded during the week of the chart's launch, of which just under 2,000 were of This New <b>Day</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British band Embrace, the chart's first number one. By the end of 2006 nearly 2.8million album downloads had been purchased, which comprised 1.8% of the total album sales.

By the end of decade over 25million albums had been downloaded and the market comprised 12.5% of total album sales. Following Embrace, a further 99 artists topped the chart; fifteen did so with two albums. Including original soundtracks and compilations, a total of 121 albums reached number one during the 2000s. , the UK Album Download Chart continues to be published each week by the OCC.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 3 June, she {{launched}} nine B5Ns, escorted by six Zeros, to attack Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. One B5N crashed on takeoff and only {{six of the}} B5Ns {{and all of the}} Zeros were able {{to make it through the}} bad weather, destroying two PBYs and inflicting significant damage on the oil storage tanks and barracks. A second airstrike was launched later in the day to attack a group of destroyers discovered by aircraft from the first attack, but they failed to find the targets. One Zero from Ryūjō from the second strike was damaged by a Curtiss P-40 and crash landed on the island of Akutan. The aircraft, later dubbed the Akutan Zero, remained largely intact and was later salvaged and test-flown. Another airstrike was launched on the following <b>day</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> two carriers that consisted of 15 Zeros, 11 D3As, and 6 B5Ns and successfully bombed Dutch Harbor. Shortly after the aircraft were launched, the Americans attacked the carriers, but failed to inflict any damage.

5|$|By {{the morning}} of 16 January, the seas were still rough, whilst hunger and panic had taken over on the wreck. When a large raft {{carrying}} the wounded, two women and six children was launched during a lull in the weather, over 120 unwounded men scrambled to board it. This severely overloaded the craft and within minutes a large wave struck the heavy raft and capsized it, drowning all aboard. By the evening, the remaining survivors, without food or fresh water, began to succumb to exposure, {{and at least one}} officer drowned {{in a desperate attempt to}} swim to shore. Throughout the night, the survivors gathered on the less exposed parts of the hull, and, in the hope of staving off death by dehydration, drank sea water, urine, or vinegar from a small barrel that had floated up from the hold. The morning of 17January finally saw a reduction in the storm and the arrival of a small French naval brig, the Arrogante. This ship could not come close without the risk of grounding but sent her boats to the wreck in the hope of rescuing survivors. The brig was joined later in the <b>day</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cutter Aiguille.|$|E
5|$|Gielgud {{continued}} to try, without much success, {{to find new}} plays that suited him as an actor, but his direction of Peter Shaffer's first play, Five Finger Exercise (1958), received acclaim. While in the US for the Shaffer play, Gielgud revived Much Ado About Nothing, this time with Margaret Leighton as his Beatrice. Most of the New York critics praised the production, and they all praised the co-stars. He gave his first performances on television during 1959, in Rattigan's The Browning Version for CBS and N C Hunter's A <b>Day</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Sea for ITV.

5|$|Hurricane Carlos was {{an unusually}} small {{tropical}} cyclone which affected the western coast of Mexico in June2015. Forming {{as the third}} named storm and hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Carlos developed from a trough first noted by the National Hurricane Center on June7. The disturbance gradually organized and was designated as a tropical depression three days later while south of the Mexican Pacific coast. Drifting slowly northwestward, the depression was upgraded further to a tropical storm. Although persistent wind shear and dry air hampered intensification early on, Carlos strengthened into a hurricane on June13 after moving into a more favorable environment. However, the return of dry air and upwelling of cooler waters caused the system to deteriorate into a tropical storm. Paralleling the Mexican coast, Carlos later regained hurricane intensity on June15 and attained peak winds of 90mph (150km/h) a day later. The reprieve was brief, however, as the onset of wind shear, land interaction, and dry air afterward led to rapid weakening. On June17, Carlos degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure, having made landfall in Jalisco earlier that <b>day.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> morning of June18, Carlos was declared to have completely dissipated.|$|E
