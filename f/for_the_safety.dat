The initiative, however, did not gain ground when the RSK refused to negotiate.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Rodney was escorting a {{fleet of}} supply ships to relieve the Spanish siege of Gibraltar with {{a fleet of}} about twenty ships of the line when he {{encountered}} Lángara's squadron south of Cape St. Vincent.

Two other ships were also captured, but their final disposition is unclear; some Spanish sources indicate they were retaken by their Spanish crews, while Rodney's report indicates the ships were grounded and destroyed.|$|E
5|$|After David II's death, Robert II, {{the first}} of the Stewart kings, came to the throne in 1371. He was {{followed}} in 1390 by his ailing son John, who took the regnal name Robert III. During Robert III's reign (1390–1406), actual power rested largely in the hands of his brother, Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany. After the suspicious death (possibly on the orders of the Duke of Albany) of his elder son, David, Duke of Rothesay in 1402, Robert, fearful <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> of his younger son, the future James I, sent him to France in 1406. However, the English captured him en route and he spent the next 18 years as a prisoner held for ransom. As a result, after the death of Robert III, regents ruled Scotland: first, the Duke of Albany; and later his son Murdoch.|$|E

5|$|Although a cable haulage {{system had}} {{initially}} been considered, Ramsgate Olympia decided {{early in the}} line's planning to electrify the line.

The wire ran along the wall of the old tunnel, on brackets in the roof of the new tunnel, and was supported by poles at the open-air stations. The electricity was supplied by an electrical substation built by English Electric, inside the tunnel near the lower end.|$|E

The Junta appointed new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution.

The turn was poorly conducted, and the ships fell out of formation, blocking each other's fields of fire. Barbaros Hayreddin, Turgut Reis, and Mesudiye took several hits during the battle, though only Barbaros Hayreddin was significantly damaged. By 10:17, both sides had ceased firing and the Ottoman fleet withdrew into the Dardanelles. When they approached the straits, Mesudiye and Âsâr-ı Tevfik took up positions to cover {{the withdrawal of the}} damaged pre-dreadnoughts. The ships reached port by 13:00 and transferred their casualties to the hospital ship Resit Paşa.|$|E
