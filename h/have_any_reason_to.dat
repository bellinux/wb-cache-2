2500|$|In his {{lifetime}} Boulton was likely better noted for his {{membership in the}} eclectic Metaphysical Society, a short-lived association (1869–1880) of some of Britain's most gifted philosophers, theologians, academics and political leaders, although [...] "o member of the Metaphysical Society knew less renown than M.P.W. Boulton". He {{was elected to the}} society in 1874. Nevertheless, the former and future British Prime Minister and society member William Gladstone, who chaired its 9 April 1878 meeting at the Grosvenor Hotel, read Boulton's philosophical treatise Has a Metaphysical Society Any Raison d'être? (Does a metaphysical society <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> exist?) to the assembled membership that evening. It included, in part: ...|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "no reason" [...] {{argument}} {{tries to}} show that an omnipotent and omniscient being would not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> act in any way, specifically by creating the universe, {{because it would have}} no needs, wants, or desires since these very concepts are subjectively human. Since the universe exists, there is a contradiction, and therefore, an omnipotent god cannot exist. This argument is expounded upon by Scott Adams in the book God's Debris, which puts forward a form of Pandeism as its fundamental theological model. A similar argument is put forward in Ludwig von Mises's [...] "Human Action". He referred to it as the [...] "praxeological argument" [...] and claimed that a perfect being would have long ago satisfied all its wants and desires and would {{no longer be able to}} take action in the present without proving that it had been unable to achieve its wants faster—showing it imperfect.|$|E
2500|$|After {{her divorce}} from Nick and his {{marriage}} to Phyllis, Sharon moved on by marrying a rival to the Newman family, Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman). Bergman {{said that it was}} [...] "only appropriate" [...] that the couple found each other, explaining: [...] "Wherever Sharon goes, she is embarrassed. Will Phyllis come walking around the corner? But Sharon doesn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> be embarrassed with Jack." [...] However, Bergman also noted that Jack's intamicy with her [...] "all happens so quickly" [...] which could indicate he was up to something manipulative. Case praised the marriage as being a good representation of modern-day marriages. Additionally, she felt that Sharon had [...] "lost her identity" [...] after divorcing Nick and Cassie's death, and found a new one in her marriage to Jack. Nick and Sharon remained close despite their separate marriages. In 2007, Nick ended up in a plane crash, losing his memory. When he returned, he thought it was 2005, believing he was married to Sharon and Cassie was alive. He even kissed Sharon; but regained his memory and returned to Phyllis and their infant daughter, Summer. Phyllis became jealous of Sharon's place in Nick's life, prompting her to write an article in their magazine Restless Style, in which she described Sharon as a [...] "needy" [...] "gum-chewing twit" [...] who twirls her hair. Nick was angry at Phyllis for berating the mother of his children, although it was evident that he still loved Sharon and was protective of her. Stafford said: [...] "He [...] Freaks. She wrote this scathing thing. But Nick says it's not appropriate for her to go after the mother of his son like that," ...|$|E
2500|$|Francis Jeffrey, a Whig {{lawyer and}} editor of the Edinburgh Review, {{originally}} favoured Wordsworth's poetry following the publication of Lyrical Ballads in 1798 but turned against the poet from 1802 onward. In response to Wordsworth's 1807 collection of poetry, Jeffrey contributed an anonymous review to the October 1807 Edinburgh Review that condemned Wordsworth's poetry again. In particular, he declared the ode [...] "beyond all doubt, the most illegible and unintelligible part of the publication. We can pretend to give no analysis or explanation of it;-- our readers must make what they can of the following extracts." [...] After quoting the passage, he argues that he has provided enough information for people to judge if Wordsworth's new school of poetry should be replace the previous system of poetry: [...] "If we were to stop here, we do not think that Mr Wordsworth, or his admirers, would <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> complain; for what we have now quoted is undeniably the most peculiar and characteristic part of his publication, and must be defended and applauded if the merit or originality of his system is to be seriously maintained. In putting forth his own opinion, Jeffrey explains, [...] "In our own opinion, however, the demerit of that system cannot be fairly appretiated, until it be shown, that the author of the bad verses which we have already extracted, can write good verses when he pleases". Jeffrey later wrote a semi-positive review of the ode, for the 12 April 1808 Edinburgh Review, that praised Wordsworth when he was least Romantic in his poetry. He believed that Wordsworth's greatest weakness was portraying the low aspects of life in a lofty tone.|$|E
