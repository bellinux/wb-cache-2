40|$|Extensive {{analysis}} of flat-plate radiative panels operation using average hourly weather data for a maritime climate region was performed. The panels are integrated {{in the space}} ventilation system with air-cooling {{by means of a}} cold-water coil. Their primary function is to prepare sufficient quantity of cold water, integrating radiative and convective cooling, that is collected in the cold-water tank during the nighttime operation. That cold water is used for cooling of the air during daytime. By small modification during daytime, solar panels could be turned into collectors and used to produce the hot water that is collected in a separate tank. A simulation model for the parametric {{analysis of}} the system in summer operating conditions and influence of its components on the system 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>operation</b> was developed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze and improve the {{transient}} stability of an industrial {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) system in a high-tech science park in Taiwan. The CHP system installed two 161 [*]kV/ 161 [*]kV high-impendence transformers to connect with Taipower System (TPS) for both decreasing the short-circuit fault current and increasing the fault critical clearing time. The transient stabilities of three types of operation modes in CHP units, 3 G 1 S, 2 G 1 S, and 1 G 1 S, are analyzed. Under the 3 G 1 <b>S</b> <b>operation</b> mode, the system frequency is immediately restored to 60 [*]Hz after tie line tripping with the TPS. Under the 1 G 1 S and 2 G 1 <b>S</b> <b>operation</b> modes, the system frequencies will continuously decrease and eventually become unstable. A novel transient stability improvement approach using load shedding technique based on the change in frequency is proposed to improve the transient stability...|$|R
