40|$|AbstractEnlimomab, an anti-interleukin- 2 {{receptor}} (anti-IL- 2 R) monoclonal antibody, may {{be useful}} in the treatment of steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) by inhibiting 1 of its putative immunopathogenic pathways. We retrospectively analyzed 40 consecutive patients who received <b>enlimomab</b> as salvage treatment for steroid refractory aGVHD at a single institution between June 1999 and December 2004. <b>Enlimomab</b> was given intravenously at a dose of 11 mg/d for 3 consecutive days, followed by 5. 5 mg/d for 7 consecutive days and then 5. 5 mg every other day for 5 doses. No infusion-related side effects were noted. Twenty-three patients (58 %) responded, including 15 (38 %) complete and 8 (20 %) partial responses. Median overall survival was 294 days (58 - 996 days) for responders versus 14 days for nonresponders (P <. 001), with a 1 year probability of 59 % vs 0 % for overall survival (P <. 0001). Patients without gastrointestinal (GI) involvement showed a higher response rate (100 % versus 50 % for those without versus with GI involvement, P =. 03) In addition, patients who showed some response by day 15 had a higher overall survival (73 ± 12 % vs 24 ± 12 %, respectively, P =. 02). The {{results of this study suggest}} that <b>enlimomab</b> may be an effective salvage therapy for patients with steroid-refractory aGVHD, particularly for those without GI disease, and supports further studies with this agent in prospective controlled trials...|$|E
