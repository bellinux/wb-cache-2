Different drying technologies, such as <b>directly</b> <b>heated</b> rotary <b>dryers,</b> flash dryers, and steam dryers, are available to solve this problem. The energy requirements of and off-gas generated from different dryer types are compared. The performance of the steam dryer {{was found to be}} superior to that of the others. In particular, the rotary steam dryer and its benefits are discussed. Structural properties confer an advantage on the rotary steam dryer, for wear on tube elements is eliminated, and drying efficiency is improved.

This document is published by the European Commission pursuant to Article 13 (6) of the Directive. This BREF for the production of wood-based panels covers the activities specified in Section 6. 1 (c) of Annex I to Directive 2010 / 75 /EU. In particular, this document addresses the following processes and activities: • the manufacture of wood-based panels by dry or wet processes; including the production of: • particleboard (PB); • oriented strand board (OSB); • medium density fibreboard (MDF), including low density fibreboard (LDF) and high density fibreboard (HDF), produced in a dry process; • fibreboard, including rigidboard (RB) and flexboard (FB), produced in a dry process; • fibreboard, including softboard (SB) and hardboard (HB), produced in a wet process. This document covers all activities from the storage of raw materials to the finished raw board ready for storage. This document additionally addresses the following activities which are considered activities directly associated to the main Annex I, Section 6. 1 (c) activity, even if the directly associated activity is not necessarily an Annex I activity itself: • on-site combustion plants (including engines) generating hot gases for <b>directly</b> <b>heated</b> <b>dryers</b> without restriction of capacity; • the manufacture of impregnated paper with resins.

The cool, dry air is then heated and re-circulated back into the drum. Depending on the model, the manufacturers claim that <b>heat</b> pump <b>dryers</b> use 25 – 70 % less energy than the average electric dryer. Consumer Reports (2015) tested a <b>heat</b> pump clothes <b>dryer</b> {{and found that the}} <b>heat</b> pump clothes <b>dryer</b> used about 40 % less electricity, but took 112  min to dry a 12 -pound load, 38  min longer than the time used in a regular clothes <b>dryer.</b> <b>Heat</b> pump clothes <b>dryers</b> are not popular among US consumers, with a market share of almost zero (Evergreen Economics 2016). Meyers et al.

Another study, conducted by Martin et al.

50|$|The {{rotary dryer}} {{is a type}} of {{industrial}} dryer employed to reduce or minimize the liquid moisture content of the material it is handling by bringing it into direct contact with a <b>heated</b> gas. The <b>dryer</b> is made up of a large, rotating cylindrical tube, usually supported by concrete columns or steel beams. The dryer slopes slightly so that the discharge end is lower than the material feed end in order to convey the material through the dryer under gravity. Material to be dried enters the dryer, and as the dryer rotates, the material is lifted up by a series of internal fins lining the inner wall of the dryer. When the material gets high enough to roll back off the fins, it falls back {{down to the bottom of}} the dryer, passing through the hot gas stream as it falls. This gas stream can either be moving toward the discharge end from the feed end (known as co-current flow), or toward the feed end from the discharge end (known as counter-current flow). The gas stream can be made up of a mixture of air and combustion gases from a burner, in which case the dryer is called a direct <b>heated</b> <b>dryer.</b> Alternatively, the gas stream may consist of air or another (sometimes inert) gas that is preheated. When the gas stream is preheated by some means where burner combustion gases do not enter the dryer, the dryer known as an indirect-heated type. Often, indirect <b>heated</b> <b>dryers</b> are used when product contamination is a concern. In some cases, a combination of direct-indirect <b>heated</b> rotary <b>dryers</b> are also available to improve the overall efficiency.|$|R

50|$|A closed-cycle <b>heat</b> pump clothes <b>dryer</b> uses a <b>heat</b> pump to {{dehumidify}} {{the processing}} air. Such dryers typically use {{less than half}} the energy per load of a condenser dryer.Whereas condensation dryers use a passive heat exchanger cooled by ambient air, these <b>dryers</b> use a <b>heat</b> pump. The hot, humid air from the tumbler is passed through a heat pump where the cold side condenses the water vapor into either a drain pipe or a collection tank and the hot side reheats the air afterwards for re-use. In this way not only does the dryer avoid the need for ducting, but it also conserves much of its <b>heat</b> within the <b>dryer</b> instead of exhausting it into the surroundings. <b>Heat</b> pump <b>dryers</b> can therefore use up to 50% less energy required by either condensation or traditional <b>dryers.</b> Domestic <b>heat</b> pump <b>dryers</b> are designed to work in typical ambient temperatures from 5 to 30 °C.Below 5 °C, drying times significantly increase.|$|R

50|$|In-storage drying methods {{refers to}} those grain is dried {{and stored in}} the same container. Low-temperature drying, also known as near-ambient drying, is one of in-storage drying methods. There are four major factors which {{influence}} low temperature drying: the variability of weather, the harvest moisture content, the air flow in the storage bin {{and the amount of}} heated air. Most low-temperature dryers are built to dry grain as slowly as possible, while in the same time less spoilage on the grain. It is suggested that low temperature drying system is better operated when the average daily temperature is between 30 °C and 50 °C. Rather than control the drying air temperature, the low-temperature drying focuses on the relative humidity in order to achieve equilibrium moisture content (EMC) in all grain layers. Low-temperature drying process usually takes 5 days to several months depends on several important variables: weather, airflow, initial moisture content and amount of heat used. Among which, airflow is the key factor. Without appropriate airflow rate, spoilage will occur before drying is completed. By using heated air (LP heat, electric heat and solar heat), the relative humidity of the drying air is better controlled to achieve the desired moisture content. Usually, <b>heated</b> air <b>dryer</b> is used when the relative humidity larger than 70%. In electric <b>heat</b> <b>dryers,</b> an electrical resistant heater is usually placed before the fan to heat the airstream. In some case, a humidistat is employed to control the heater. In solar <b>heat</b> <b>dryers,</b> the drying air passes through the solar collector first to be heated (usually 10 to 12 °F rise), then enters the bin through the fan and motor. The advantages of in-storage low temperature drying are quick filling, high quality product, less equipment requirement; while the disadvantages are long drying time, electrical demand if using electric heat, high management skills and uncertain harvest moisture content.|$|R
