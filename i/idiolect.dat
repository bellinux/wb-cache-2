Richard Polenberg, in his study of that jurist, stated, [...] "Cardozo had a genius for making it seem that the results he reached were logical, inevitable, and legally unassailable". Prosser stated, [...] "with due respect to the superlative style in which both [...] are written, neither of them wears well on long acquaintance. Both of them beg the question shamelessly, stating dogmatic propositions without reason or explanation."

50|$|Ontologically, an <b>idiolect</b> is {{construed}} as a (possibly infinite) set of abstract sentences: form-meaning pairs consisting, {{in the case of}} a spoken rather than a written or signed <b>idiolect,</b> of a structured phonetic sound sequence and a meaning of this sequence. For each <b>idiolect</b> in a language, there is a system (<b>idiolect</b> system) that specifies which form-meaning pairs are elements of the <b>idiolect.</b> Every <b>idiolect</b> system consists of (technically: is an n-tuple whose components are) a phonetic, phonological, morphological, syntactic, lexico-semantic, and sentence-semantic part; and each part determines a different type of properties that the form-meaning pairs must have in order to belong to the <b>idiolect.</b> In written <b>idiolect</b> systems, the phonetic and phonological parts are replaced by a graphetic and a graphematic part, in signed <b>idiolect</b> systems by a cheremic and a cherematic part. (There may be other components in addition to the ones listed above; the precise structure of <b>idiolect</b> systems is a matter of ongoing research.) The parts of an <b>idiolect</b> system are grouped into the sound system (script system, chereme system), the morpho-syntactic (or grammatical) subsystem, and the semantic subsystem of the <b>idiolect</b> system. (There is no pragmatic part or subsystem - 'pragmatic' properties of form-meaning pairs, as far as they are determined by the <b>idiolect</b> system itself, are covered by the semantic subsystem, or else indirectly by the idiolect's place in the variety structure.) Finally, a system for a language (or language variety) is a construct of properties shared by every system of every <b>idiolect</b> in the language (or language variety). Idiolects, varieties, languages, and their systems are all {{construed as}} extramental and abstract.|$|E

50|$|Given the {{distinction}} between syntactic units (including syntactic word forms) and lexical words, two main types of syntactic categories are postulated for the syntactic part of any <b>idiolect</b> system. Type 1 syntactic categories (also called 'syntactic unit categories') are sets of syntactic units of the <b>idiolect</b> system, and include the syntactic constituent categories as well as word form categories like cases, numbers, tenses, and definiteness categories. The type 1 syntactic categories of an <b>idiolect</b> system are given through a classification system (a system of cross- and sub-classifications) {{on the set of}} all syntactic units of the <b>idiolect</b> system, called the 'Syntactic Unit Ordering.' Type 2 syntactic categories (also called 'word categories') are sets of lexical words. They include the 'parts of speech' of the <b>idiolect</b> system and their subcategories. The type 2 categories are given by the 'Lexical Word Ordering', a classification system on the set of all lexical words of the <b>idiolect</b> system. Both the Syntactic Unit Ordering and the Lexical Word Ordering are components of the syntactic part of an <b>idiolect</b> system.|$|E
50|$|Systems of idiolects (<b>idiolect</b> systems) {{and systems}} for {{languages}} differ {{from each other}} both ontologically and in their relation to speakers' minds. <b>Idiolect</b> systems are n-tuples (as specified above) whereas language systems are sets of properties of such n-tuples. Moreover, for every <b>idiolect</b> that {{is a means of}} communication for a given speaker, there must be a (psychological and physiological) internal basis in the speaker that corresponds to a system of this <b>idiolect,</b> but there is no such internal basis for entire language systems. From an IL point of view, distinguishing between language systems, <b>idiolect</b> systems, idiolects (themselves no systems), and speaker-internal bases for idiolects is a cornerstone for a realistic theory of natural languages and language use.|$|E
50|$|Most importantly, a {{distinction}} is {{made between the}} definition of a term and the identification of corresponding linguistic entities in given <b>idiolect</b> systems. For example, terms such as 'phoneme,' 'suffix,' 'verb,' 'singular,' 'accusative,' etc. are construed not as categorial terms (denoting sets of linguistic entities) but as names of two-place relations ('is-a-phoneme-of,' 'is-a-suffix-of,' etc.) between linguistic entities and <b>idiolect</b> systems S (e.g., SLEEP is-a-verb-of SE, SCHLAFEN is-a-verb-of SG, where SE and SG are, respectively, an English and a German <b>idiolect</b> system: one and the same relation is-a-verb-of holds between SLEEP and SE, SCHLAFEN and SG, etc.). Names for categories of a given <b>idiolect</b> system are then derived from such relational terms: the expression 'verb of SE' denotes the set of all verbs of SE (a category), i.e., denotes the set of all linguistic entities that are related to <b>idiolect</b> system SE by the relation a verbof. While the relational term 'verb' is defined in the Integrational Theory of Language Systems so as to allow for arbitrary <b>idiolect</b> systems, the corresponding categories (verb in SE, verb in SG, etc.) must be identified in a grammar for individual <b>idiolect</b> systems, and the identifying properties may vary greatly among the systems of idiolects in different languages or even within a single language. It is a task not of a general theory of language but of theories of individual languages or language varieties - e.g., of individual grammars - to formulate identifying properties for the entities (categories, etc.) postulated for the <b>idiolect</b> systems of a given language (or variety). (Consider, for instance, a language in whose <b>idiolect</b> systems S all infinitive forms of verbs - and only such forms - have a certain prefix, giving rise to an identifying property for the category infinitive-in-S in the <b>idiolect</b> systems of this language. Clearly, this criterion should not be used to define the term 'infinitive' in a general theory of language.) Given this distinction, a term like 'verb' may be defined by means of word- or sentence-semantic criteria; the syntactic nature of the corresponding categories in individual <b>idiolect</b> systems is still guaranteed {{by the fact that the}} categories can be identified by resort to the syntactic means of the <b>idiolect</b> systems (morphological marking, word order, intonation) and, possibly, properties of lexical meanings. Defining a term in a general theory of language does not, however, imply that there are corresponding entities in all <b>idiolect</b> systems (for instance, we can formulate a general definition of 'adjective' although there may be languages without adjectives).|$|E
40|$|We {{look at the}} two English {{translations}} of Natalia Ginzburg's autobiographical narrative Lessico famigliare (1963) with a focus on the literary function of <b>idiolects,</b> and the challenges of translating them, particularly code-mixing between standard Italian, dialects and other languages. We draw on Bassnett-McGuire (who notes a tendency for translators to "fail to consider the way in which individual sentences form part of the total structure") (1980 : 115), Berman (who argues that source text markers, such as <b>idiolects,</b> form part of an "underlying network of signification within the text as a whole") (2000 : 292 - 3) and Gutt (who maintains that a successful translation will recognise and address the relevancy of the role played by <b>idiolects</b> in the text) (2000). We agree with Eco (2003) when he argues that losses and gains are inevitable in any translation process and problems must be negotiated individually. We would suggest that an effective strategy for translators may be to negotiate solutions from their specific places within what Pym (1998) calls 'intercultures', points of cultural overlap between source and target texts...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I will compare some of Dummett and Davidson’s claims {{on the problem}} of {{communication}} and idiolects: how can we understand each other if we use different <b>idiolects?</b> First I define the problem, giving the alternative theses of (I) the priority of language over <b>idiolects</b> and (II) the priority of <b>idiolects</b> over language. I then present Dummett's claims supporting (I) and Davidson's claims supporting (II). In the first three paragraphs, I will provide a reconstruction of the debate between Dummett and Davidson, showing some weaknesses in both programs. In the remaining two paragraphs, I will work on the concept of “convergence”. I will try to show that the process of convergence, which is basic in Davidson’s theory, needs a level of (formal) analysis of what I call “contextual competence”. The main point of the paper is to show a blindspot in Davidson and Dummett, and to fill the gap. In short, to explain communication, Dummett asks for too much sharing among speakers, and Davidson asks for too little. Even if proposed, for the sake of argument, as a possible supplementation of Davidson’s idea of convergence, the suggestion of contextual competence may be used as an extension of Dummett’s molecularis...|$|R

50|$|Reflecting {{the basic}} {{structure}} of spoken <b>idiolect</b> systems (see above), the Integrational Theory of Language Systems comprises Integrational Phonology, Integrational Morpho-Syntax (with Integrational Morphology and Integrational Syntax), and Integrational Semantics (Integrational Lexical Semantics, including morpho-semantics and word semantics, and Integrational Sentence Semantics). For medial types of <b>idiolect</b> systems other than the spoken one, suitable subtheories - corresponding to Integrational Phonology - are provided for but have not yet been worked out in detail (Integrational Graphematics for written, Integrational Cherematics for signed <b>idiolect</b> systems).|$|E
50|$|Integrational Phonology is a 'declarative' {{two-level}} phonology that postulates {{two distinct}} levels (or 'parts') {{in the sound}} system of any <b>idiolect</b> system, a less abstract phonetic and a more abstract phonological one.

(Speech-sound events are concrete entities, located in space-time.) Phonological sounds differ from phonetic ones by {{a higher degree of}} abstraction: While sounds on the phonetic level (i.e., part) of an <b>idiolect</b> system contain all properties that characterize normal utterances of entities of the <b>idiolect</b> system, phonological sounds contain only those properties that are functional in the <b>idiolect</b> system, i.e., are relevant with respect to distinctions in the morphological, syntactic, or semantic parts of the system.|$|E

Finally, each entity proposed by a general theory of language or by a theory of an individual language, variety, or <b>idiolect</b> should also be justified by metatheoretic considerations. Consider, for example, the set of all adjective forms of a given English <b>idiolect</b> system whose sound sequences start with /bl/. Such a set should hardly be postulated as a syntactic category of this <b>idiolect</b> system, even though the set would easily be identified, and a corresponding term would easily be defined.|$|E
