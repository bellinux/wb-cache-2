40|$|The {{hobbing machine}} {{of recent years}} has {{positively}} introduced a computer numerical control (CNC) system, but many traditional hobbing machines with gear trains are still being used to produce gears. These traditional machines generally prepare many indexing <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> for gear cutting. But when we cut the gear of a prime number of teeth, the indexing <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> is not prepared for more than about 100 teeth of the gear. In such a case, we have to correct the indexing {{of the number of}} teeth using a differential gear to cut a helical gear, but when we apply the prime number of teeth on the helical gear, we cannot choose an arbitrary feed speed. Therefore, in this paper, we report on a new indexing mechanism for the prime number of gear teeth using a double differential gear device, which reduces the number of indexes the <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> must go through...|$|R
50|$|Maudslay did not {{invent the}} slide-rest (as others such as James Nasmyth have claimed), {{and may not}} have been the first to combine a lead screw, slide-rest, and set of <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> all on one lathe (Jesse Ramsden may have done that in 1775; {{evidence}} is scant), but he did introduce the three-part combination of lead screw, slide rest, and <b>change</b> <b>gears,</b> sparking a great advance in machine tools and in the engineering use of screw threads.|$|R
5000|$|Gear change: The <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> in MMT is noticeable, {{unlike in}} a full {{automatic}} car. Under E gear, the car will automatically <b>change</b> the <b>gear</b> depending on speed and gradient information. It is recommended that the accelerator pedal should be momentarily lifted off during <b>gear</b> <b>change.</b> A constant throttle can also be maintained on the accelerator, and <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> can still occur, although the car will feel noticeably more jerky during <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> than {{in a full}} automatic.|$|R

50|$|A {{gear stick}} (rarely spelled gearstick), gear lever (both UK English), {{gearshift}} or shifter (US English) is a metal lever {{attached to the}} shift assembly in a manual transmission-equipped automobile and is used to <b>change</b> <b>gears.</b> In an automatic transmission-equipped vehicle, a similar device {{is known as a}} gear selector. A gear stick will normally be used to <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> whilst depressing the clutch pedal with the left foot to disengage the engine from the drivetrain and wheels. Automatic transmission vehicles, semi-automatic transmissions, and those with continuously variable transmission gearboxes do not require a clutch pedal.|$|R
50|$|A {{sprag clutch}} {{is used in}} some {{automatic}} transmissions {{as a method of}} allowing the transmission to smoothly <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> under load. Various models of General Motors' turbo-hydramatic gearbox have used this system.|$|R

5000|$|A crash gearbox, {{also known}} as a crash box, is a {{transmission}} type used in old cars, trucks, and other automotive vehicles. It is more properly called a [...] "sliding mesh" [...] gearbox and has the nickname [...] "crash" [...] because it is difficult to <b>change</b> <b>gears,</b> so <b>gear</b> <b>changes</b> are often accompanied by loud noises. The etymology of [...] "crash" [...] is probably [...] "clash".|$|R
5000|$|Modern [...] "Semi-{{automatic}} transmissions" [...] {{usually have}} a fully automatic mode, where the driver {{does not need to}} <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> at all, operating {{in the same manner as}} a conventional type of automatic transmission by allowing the transmission's computer to automatically <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> if, for example, the driver were redlining the engine. The semi-automatic transmission can be engaged in manual mode wherein one can up-shift or down-shift using the console-mounted shifter selecter or the paddle shifters just behind the steering wheel, without the need of a clutch pedal. The ability to shift gears manually, often via paddle shifters, can also be found on certain automatic transmissions (manumatics such as Tiptronic) and continuous variable transmissions (CVTs) (such as Lineartronic).|$|R

50|$|Fully synchronous, hydrau-pneumatic {{systems are}} {{designed}} to <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> based on engine performance and other velocity indicators, delivering torque to drive wheels. These transmissions have synchronizing mechanisms (called cone and collar synchronizers) that {{are designed to}} keep gear dog-teeth from being broken off.|$|R
50|$|The {{version for}} the BBC is {{controlled}} by the keyboard, with the player given the option to redefine the keys once the title screen is shown. The Automatic gearbox mode is omitted so the player must <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> manually with the defined keys.|$|R
5000|$|In motor {{vehicles}} automatic transmissions will <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> {{to prevent the}} engine from turning too quickly. Additionally, almost all modern vehicles are fitted with an electronic rev limiter device that will cut fuel supply or sparks to the engine to prevent overspeed.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the film}} The Dark Knight and its {{follow-up}} The Dark Knight Rises, a Shepard tone {{was used to}} create {{the sound of the}} Batpod, a motorcycle that the filmmakers didn't want to <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> and tone abruptly but to constantly accelerate.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike the Wilson, these {{clutches}} {{were controlled}} by a simple dashboard or column-mounted switch, described as [...] "a cherry on a cocktail stick", and relays. There was no mechanical servo action, so {{no need for the}} Wilson's cam or toggle arrangements and the <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> pedal.|$|R
50|$|Francis' {{career at}} Paramount <b>changed</b> <b>gears</b> when Warner Bros. promised her star status {{at a better}} salary. She {{appeared}} in George Cukor's Girls About Town (1931) and Twenty-Four Hours (1931). After Francis' career skyrocketed at Warner Bros., she would return to Paramount for Ernst Lubitsch's Trouble in Paradise (1932).|$|R
5000|$|For manual {{transmission}} equipped cars, it is a component that replaces the stock gear selector (shifter). A shift kit usually shortens the throws of selecting a gear (also {{known as a}} short throw shift), therefore allowing a driver to reduce the shift time and <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> more efficiently.|$|R

50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{was invented}} in 1927 by Tullio Campagnolo, an Italian bicycle racer. He was frustrated when he attempted to <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> during a race. At the time there was but one cog {{on each side of}} the rear hub, so <b>gear</b> <b>changes</b> necessitated stopping, removing the rear wheel, rotating it horizontally so that the opposite cog is engaged by the chain, and finally reinstalling the wheel. The weather had turned cold, and his hands were numb, so he could not operate the wingnuts which retained the wheel. He had been well-placed prior to the <b>gear</b> <b>change,</b> but lost valuable time. This prompted him to develop the quick release.|$|R
2500|$|An {{automatic}} transmission is an automobile gearbox that <b>changes</b> <b>gear</b> ratios automatically {{as the vehicle}} moves, freeing the driver from having to shift gears manually. Modern {{automatic transmission}}s trace their origins to an early [...] "horseless carriage" [...] gearbox that was developed in 1904 by the Sturtevant brothers of Boston, Massachusetts.|$|R
50|$|David Wilkinson's lathe {{is often}} {{compared}} to Henry Maudslay's which {{is believed to}} have been invented a few years before Wilkinson's. Maudslay's lathe used <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> which allowed it to cut threads of various pitches, without which Wilkinson's could only cut a fixed pitch. Wilkinson's lathe could handle heavier work.|$|R
50|$|One {{actuator}} <b>changes</b> <b>gears</b> {{while the}} other, which {{is equipped with}} a facing wear compensation system, opens and closes the clutch. The gearbox control unit also dialogues with the engine control unit. The SensoDrive gearbox has two shifting options of either the fully automated mode, or the paddle-shifted/gear-shifted manual mode.|$|R
50|$|It {{was able}} to reach up to 30 km/h. It seated four, the two rear seats could be covered by a {{convertible}} top. The car was steered by handlebars. Tilting of the handlebars forward and backward served to <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> (forward - lower gear). The wheels were wooden with gum tyre.|$|R
