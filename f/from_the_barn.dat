5|$|Fortunately for the Invaders, one {{of their}} members Mike Shonsey managed to slip <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> {{and was able to}} contact Governor Barber the next day.

5|$|Ann Marten {{was called}} to give {{evidence}} {{of the events of}} the day of Maria's disappearance and her later dreams. Thomas Marten then told the court how he had dug up his daughter, and Maria's 10-year-old brother George Marten revealed that he had seen Corder with a loaded pistol before the alleged murder and later had seen him walking <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> with a pickaxe. Lea gave evidence concerning Corder's arrest and the objects found during the search of his house. The prosecution suggested that Corder had never wanted to marry Maria, but that her knowledge of some of his criminal dealings had given her a hold over him, and that his theft of the money sent by her child's father had been a source of tension between them.|$|E
5|$|Shane arms {{the rest}} of the group and they {{converge}} on the barn just as Hershel, Rick, and the other return with the snared walkers. Shane screams that walkers are not people and shoots one of the captive walkers before breaking the locks off the barn doors. Walkers start to file out, and Shane, Andrea, T-Dog (IronE Singleton), Daryl, and Glenn execute the zombies while the others watch. At the last moment, Sophia (Madison Lintz) emerges <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn,</b> dead and zombified. The group is paralyzed with shock and sadness, unable to act as Sophia walks towards them. Only Rick is able to step forward and shoot her.|$|E

5|$|Once {{they arrive}} at the mine, Jack wanders into the local town where he has a brief {{encounter}} with Enoch Root in an apothecary's shop. Jack leaves town but gets lost in the woods, encountering pagan worshippers and witch hunters. He successfully escapes them by finding safe passage through a mine connecting to Leibniz's. Eliza and Jack move on to Amsterdam, where Eliza quickly becomes embroiled in the trade of commodities. Jack goes to Paris to sell the ostrich feathers and Turk, leaving Eliza behind. When he arrives in Paris, he meets and befriends St. George, a professional rat-killer and tamer, who helps him find lodging. While there, he becomes a messenger for bankers between Paris and Marseilles. However, during an attempt to sell Turk Jack is captured by nobles. Luckily, the presence of Jack's former employer, John Churchill, ensures {{that he is not}} immediately killed. With Churchill's help, Jack escapes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> where he has been held prisoner. During the escape, he rides Turk into a masquerade at the Hotel d'Arcachon in a costume similar to that of King Louis. With the aid of St. George's rats he escapes without injury but destroys the ballroom and removes the hand of Etienne d'Arcachon.|$|E

5000|$|Granger is a surname of English and French origin. It is an {{occupational}} {{name for a}} farm bailiff.

This officer's Anglo-Norman title was grainger, and Old French grangier, which are both derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Late Latin granicarius (a derivative of granica, meaning [...] "granary").|$|R

25|$|My first well-remembered {{intentional}} use of {{the double}} bind occurred in early boyhood. One winter day, with the weather below zero, my father led a calf {{out of the barn}} to the water trough. After the calf had satisfied its thirst, they turned back to the barn, but at the doorway the calf stubbornly braced its feet, and despite my father's desperate pulling on the halter, he could not budge the animal. I was outside playing in the snow and, observing the impasse, began laughing heartily. My father challenged me to pull the calf into the barn. Recognizing the situation as one of unreasoning stubborn resistance {{on the part of the}} calf, I decided to let the calf have full opportunity to resist, since that was what it apparently wished to do. Accordingly I presented the calf with a double bind by seizing it by the tail and pulling it away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn,</b> while my father continued to pull it inward. The calf promptly chose to resist the weaker of the two forces and dragged me into the barn. Reprinted in Collected Papers Volume 3.|$|E

500|$|Law {{developed}} his Briarcliff Manor property {{primarily as a}} corporation until 1907 when, due to rising property values and falling agricultural development in Westchester County, he purchased twelve farms—totaling —for Briarcliff Farms {{on both sides of}} the Pine Plains-Stanford Road (present-day New York State Route 82) in Pine Plains and began developing his Briarcliff Manor properties for houses, churches and schools. Law's general manager, George W. Tuttle (who had worked at Briarcliff Farms since 1901), arranged the Pine Plains purchases and the construction of new barns, a creamery, a power station and other buildings. The barns used Franklin Hiram King's King ventilation system, and the concrete dairy building cost about $25,000 ($ in [...] ).

500|$|The {{death of}} Sophia Peletier {{is a major}} {{incident}} in [...] "Pretty Much Dead Already", largely affecting the themes of the episode. After the group has shot the walkers housed in Hershel Greene's barn, Sophia appears <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> as a walker, much to the groups' dismay. A disturbed and distraught Rick Grimes pulls out his weapon and makes the decision to shoot her. Despite being initially surprised about her character's being killed off, Madison Lintz concluded that she understood its aftermath for the show. Lintz affirmed that portraying a walker was a welcoming experience for her, and stated that she was [...] "going {{to look back on}} and say that was amazing." [...] Robert Kirkman felt that killing Sophia would add more dimension to the show, as well as add more flexibility to its storyline progression. [...] "When a good idea comes up, you have to go with it," [...] he articulated. [...] "Sophia is a character who is still alive in the comic book series and who has contributed quite a bit to the overall narrative and informed a lot of story lines for a lot of different characters. Having Carol [...] survive her daughter as opposed to the other way around {{as it is in the}} comics is going to lead to interesting but different stories." [...] Although Kirkman was not on set during production of the sequence, Gimple retrieved shell casings from the blanks that were fired on set. Referred to as [...] "Barnageddon" [...] by the writers, Kirkman asserted that he emphasized unpredictability while creating the scene.|$|E

500|$|Conger {{tracked down}} Jett and interrogated him, {{learning}} of Booth's location at the Garrett farm. Before dawn on April 26, the soldiers {{caught up with}} the fugitives, who were hiding in Garrett's tobacco barn. David Herold surrendered, but Booth refused Conger's demand to surrender, saying, [...] "I prefer to come out and fight." [...] The soldiers then set the barn on fire. As Booth moved about inside the blazing barn, Sergeant Boston Corbett shot him. According to Corbett's later account, he fired at Booth because the fugitive [...] "raised his pistol to shoot" [...] at them. Conger's report to Stanton stated that Corbett shot Booth [...] "without order, pretext or excuse," [...] and recommended that Corbett be punished for disobeying orders to take Booth alive. Booth, fatally wounded in the neck, was dragged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> to the porch of Garrett's farmhouse, where he died three hours later, aged 26. The bullet had pierced three vertebrae and partially severed his spinal cord, paralyzing him. In his dying moments, he reportedly whispered, [...] "Tell my mother I died for my country." [...] Asking that his hands be raised to his face so that he could see them, Booth uttered his last words, [...] "Useless, useless," [...] and died as dawn was breaking. In Booth's pockets were found a compass, a candle, pictures of five women (actresses Alice Grey, Helen Western, Effie Germon, Fannie Brown, and Booth's fiancée Lucy Hale), and his diary, where he had written of Lincoln's death, [...] "Our country owed all her troubles to him, and God simply made me the instrument of his punishment." ...|$|E
