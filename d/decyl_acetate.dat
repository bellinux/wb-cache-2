40|$|Previous {{research}} {{showed a}} cut-off along homologous {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) {{in their ability to}} produce acute human mucosal irritation. The present study sought to specify the particular cut-off homolog for sensory eye irritation in an acetate and n-alcohol series. A 1, 900 ml glass vessel system and a three-alternative forced-choice procedure served to test nonyl, decyl, and dodecyl acetate, and 1 -nonanol, 1 -decanol, and 1 -undecanol. Flowrate to the eye ranged from 2 to 8 L/min and time of exposure from 3 to 24 sec. <b>Decyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and 1 -undecanol were the shortest homologs that failed to produce eye irritation under all conditions, producing a cut-off effect. Increasing the vapor concentration of <b>decyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and 1 -undecanol by 3 and 8 times, respectively, via heating them to 37 °C made either or both VOCs detectable to only half of the 12 subjects tested, even though the higher vapor concentration was well above a predicted eye irritation threshold. When eye irritation thresholds for homologous acetates and n-alcohols were plotted {{as a function of the}} longest unfolded length of the molecule, the values for <b>decyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and 1 -undecanol fell within a restricted range of 18 to 19 Å. The outcome suggests that the basis for the cut-off is biological, i. e., the molecule lacks a key size or structure to trigger transduction, rather than physical, i. e., the vapor concentration is too low to precipitate detection...|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} the concentration-detection (i. e., psychometric) functions for the eye irritation evoked by three homologous n-alcohols (1 -nonanol, 1 -decanol and 1 -undecanol) and two homologous acetates (nonyl and <b>decyl</b> <b>acetate).</b> A vapor delivery device {{based on a}} dynamic dilution of stimuli in nitrogen served to present various concentrations of each compound, including the undiluted vapor, to the subjects (n >= 26). Delivered concentrations were quantified by gas chromatography. Detection probability (P) was assessed via a three-alternative, forced-choice procedure and quantified on a scale ranging from P = 0. 0 (chance detection) to P = 1. 0 (perfect detection). Flow rate to the eye equaled 2. 5 l/min and time of exposure was 6 s. The functions for 1 -undecanol and <b>decyl</b> <b>acetate</b> plateaued at P approximate to 0. 5 and P approximate to 0. 25, respectively, such that further increases in concentration failed to increase detection notably. Thus, both series reached a break point, or cut-off, in the detection of ocular irritation. The present outcome provides additional evidence that the cut-off does not rest on the low vapor concentration of the homolog but, more likely, on the homolog exceeding a critical molecular dimension(s), which prevents it from interacting effectively with the appropriate receptors...|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} detection thresholds for nasal pungency (in anosmics), odor (in normosmics) and {{eye irritation}} employing a homologous series of acetates: methyl through octyl <b>acetate,</b> <b>decyl</b> and dodecyl <b>acetate.</b> All anosmics reliably detected the series up to heptyl acetate. Only the anosmics without smell since birth (congenital) reliably detected octyl acetate, {{and only one}} congenital anosmic detected <b>decyl</b> and dodecyl <b>acetate.</b> Anosmics who lost smell from head trauma proved to be selectively less sensitive. As expected, odor thresholds lay well below pungency thresholds. Eye irritation thresholds for selected acetates came close to nasal pungency thresholds. All three types of thresholds decreased logarithmically with carbon chain length, as previously seen with homologous alcohols and as seen in narcotic and toxic phenomena. Results imply that nasal pungency for these stimuli rests upon a physical - rather than chemical - interaction with susceptible mucosal structures. When expressed as thermodynamic activity, nasal pungency thresholds remain remarkably constant within and across the homologous series of acetates and alcohols...|$|R

Several members of the title compounds, along with their geometric and/or positional isomers, have been prepared from Z-lactones 2 a-d, which are easily available from the corresponding acetylenic lactones 1 a-d, prepared earlier from cycloalkanones. The Z to E isomerization of alkenyl acetates 6 a-d to 8 a-d was carried out both by a catalytic technique (NaNO 2, HNO 3, D) and the chemical inversion procedure (NBS, TFA; NaI, DMF, D). (E) - 6 -Decenyl alcohol (7 b) was also prepared from the acetylenic ester 15 b by the trans reduction with LiAlH 4 in refluxing diglyme. <b>decyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (18) and hexadecyl acetate (19), pheromone components of the turnip moth (Agrotis segetum) and the male butterfly Lycorea ceres ceres, respectively, were obtained by the catalytic hydrogenation (Pd, H 2) of the corresponding Z-alkenyl acetates...|$|E
30|$|Knowledge {{is scarce}} about the {{degradation}} of ketones in yeasts. For bacteria a subterminal degradation of alkanes to ketones and their further metabolization has been described which always involved Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs). In addition, the question has to be clarified whether alkenes are converted to ketones, in particular for the oil degrading yeast Candida maltosa little is known. In this study we show {{the degradation of}} the aliphatic ketone dodecane- 2 -one by Candida maltosa and the related yeasts Candida tropicalis, Candida catenulata and Candida albicans as well as Trichosporon asahii and Yarrowia lipolytica. One pathway is initiated by the formation of <b>decyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> resulting from a Baeyer-Villiger-oxidation of this ketone. Beyond this, an initial reduction to dodecane- 2 -ol by a keto reductase was clearly shown. In addition, two different ways to metabolize dodec- 1 -ene were proposed. One involved the formation of dodecane- 2 -one {{and the other one}} a conversion leading to carboxylic and dicarboxylic acids. Furthermore the induction of ketone degrading enzymes by dodecane- 2 -one and dodec- 1 -ene was shown. Interestingly, with dodecane no subterminal degradation products were detected and it did not induce any enzymes to convert dodecane- 2 -one.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{behavioral}} paradigm designed to simulate olfactory-guided foraging, {{the ability of}} five squirrel monkeys to distinguish iso-amyl acetate from n- and iso-forms of other acetic esters (ethyl acetate to <b>decyl</b> <b>acetate)</b> and from other esters carrying the iso-amyl group (iso-amyl propionate to iso-amyl capronate) was investigated. We found (i) that all five animals were clearly able to discriminate between all odor pairs tested; (n) a significant negative correlation between discrimination performance and structural similarity of odorants in terms of differences in carbon chain length of both the aliphatic alcohol group and the aliphatic acid group of the esters; and (iii) that iso- and n-amyl acetate were perceived as qualitatively similar despite different steric conformation. Using a triple-forced choice procedure, 20 human subjects were tested on the same tasks in parallel and showed a very similar pattern of discrimination performance compared with the squirrel monkeys. Thus, {{the results of this}} study provide evidence of well-developed olfactory discrimination ability in squirrel monkeys for aliphatic esters and support the assumption that human and non-human primates may share common principles of odor quality perception.

40|$|Animals often {{respond to}} danger by raising alarm to inform others. Alarm signals come in many {{different}} forms, such as visual or mechanical display, sound or odour. Some animals produce vocal alarm signals that vary {{with the level of}} danger. For chemical alarm signals, virtually nothing is known about such context-dependent signalling due to a general notion that alarm pheromones have fixed compositions. Here, we show that larvae of the Western Flower Thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) produce an alarm pheromone whose composition varies with the level of danger they face: the presence of a relatively harmless predator or a very dangerous predator, that is either actually attacking or not. The frequency of alarm pheromone excretion increases with the level of danger. Moreover, the composition of excreted alarm pheromone varies in the relationship between total and relative amount of the putative two components, <b>decyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (DAc) and dodecyl acetate (DDAc). When pheromone is excreted with a predator present but not attacking, the percentage DDAc increases with the total amount of pheromone. When a predator does attack, however, the relationship between percentage DDAc and total amount of pheromone is reversed. Taken together, the alarm signal of thrips larvae appears to be context dependent, which to our knowledge is the first report of context-dependent composition of an alarm pheromone...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>decyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> from the transesterification of vinyl acetate with decanol, was studied in a high-pressure experimental set-up, {{equipped with a}} variable volume batch reactor, operating isothermally at 35 ºC and 100 bar, using CO 2 in supercritical conditions as solvent, and Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB), immobilized on the macroporous resin Lewatit B (Novozym 435 ®), as catalyst. The enzymatic content was determined for each particle size of the catalyst. It was shown that the smallest particles have a larger specific amount of enzyme, and {{the results indicate that}} the enzyme is located in an external shell of the particle, following an “egg-shell ” model type, with a thickness of ca. 60 µm (assuming a homogeneous distribution), independent of the particle size. Both external and internal mass transfer resistances were evaluated. External resistances were easily eliminated by stirring and internal diffusional limitations can be considered as negligible. The effect of the feed concentration of substrates on the initial reaction rate was also studied. It was observed that, above a certain concentration of decanol in excess relatively to vinyl acetate, the reaction is inhibited by the alcohol. On the contrary, the reaction is favoured when the reactor is fed wit...|$|E
40|$|The {{apparent}} molar heat capacity, phi-c, its associative part, phi-c(assoc), and {{the excess}} heat capacity, C(p) E, {{have been obtained}} at 25 -degrees-C through the concentration range for methanol, hexan- 1 -ol and decan- 1 -ol {{in a series of}} proton acceptor solvents: methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, octyl acetate, methyl octanoate, <b>decyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and methyl tetradecanoate. The results are explained quantitatively by the Tresczanowicz-Kehiaian (TK) association model and the Flory lattice model in terms of alcohol self-association into tetramers, characterized by an OH-OH equilibrium constant and enthalpy, and by alcohol-ester complex formation characterized by an OH-COO equilibrium constant and enthalpy, each independent of alcohol and ester chain length. As predicted, phi-c(assoc) at infinite alcohol dilution is independent of the choice of alcohol, but increases with increasing ester chain length. With increasing alcohol concentration phi-c(assoc) passes through a maximum which is much reduced compared with the inert solvent case. For each alcohol, C(p) E increases with increasing ester chain length, while for the same ester, C(p) E decreases with increasing alcohol chain length. dC(p) E/dT is positive for mixtures of methanol and methyl acetate, as predicted by the TK model. It is negative for decanol with methyl acetate, contrary to the TK model, but consistent with a non-random distribution of alcohol tetramers in the solution...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The Western {{flower thrips}} Frankliniella occidentalis {{produces}} conspicuous anal droplets that {{function as a}} direct defense against various predators. These droplets also function in pheromonal communication in that they contain a mixture of <b>decyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and dodecyl acetate, which acts as an alarm. Exposure of thrips to synthetic pheromone is known to promote takeoff or refuge seeking, but {{the effect of the}} natural pheromone has not yet been studied. Here, we not only studied the response to natural pheromone, but also tested the new hypothesis that the alarm pheromone primes a defensive response in thrips. This test was carried out by measuring the reaction time to a simulated predator attack after exposure to synthetic or natural alarm pheromone (against a control with no pheromone at all). The reaction was quantified in terms of the time it takes a thrips larva to produce a droplet after attack. We found that thrips larvae produce droplets of alarm pheromone faster when cues associated with danger are present. There {{were no significant differences in}} reaction times of responses to synthetic pheromone, natural pheromone, or odors from a patch with a predator attacking a thrips larva. This implies that the synthetic pheromone mimics the natural pheromone, and that other cues emanating from the predator play a minor role. We conclude that the alarm pheromone increases the vigilance of the thrips, and this may promote its survival...|$|E
40|$|Thrips {{have several}} {{advantages}} {{that make them}} particularly suitable {{for the study of}} the evolution of alarm signalling. When in danger, thrips larvae defend themselves by the excretion of ‘anal droplets’: a predator touched by such a droplet interrupts the attack and switches to cleaning. These droplets may contain an alarm pheromone, consisting of two compounds: <b>decyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and dodecyl actetate. The presence of alarm pheromone evokes anti‐predator behaviour in thrips, such as elevated alertness and moving away from the scene, and this behaviour potentially improves the chances of survival of the signal receivers. Thrips larvae may encounter a range of predators, the one more dangerous than the other. If a thrips larva survives the presence of a predator, this larva may become a signal sender on a next occasion. Thrips live in groups, comprising both related and unrelated individuals. A practical advantage of the alarm pheromone of thrips is that synthetic mimics of its two components are available. The anal droplets can be observed, counted, collected and analysed for the presence and composition of pheromone. Furthermore, thrips larvae can be stimulated to produce droplets by prodding them with a fine brush. The combination of these advantages enables the manipulation of pheromone production as well as the determination of quality and quantity of the alarm pheromone in presence of various types of predator. Three main questions are central to this thesis. First, does the alarm pheromone of thrips larvae indeed improve the defensive capacities of conspecific thrips? Second, is thrips alarm pheromone production context‐dependent? And third, how does relatedness influence alarm communication...|$|E
40|$|Chemical group 1 (CG 1) {{consists}} of straight-chain primary aliphatic alcohols/aldehydes/acids, acetals and esters with esters containing saturated alcohols and acetals containing saturated aldehydes of which 86 are currently authorised {{for use as}} flavours in food.
