5|$|Early {{examples}} of Anglo-Saxon art are largely metalwork, particularly bracelets, clasps and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in <b>exceptional</b> <b>items</b> {{such as the}} intricately carved whalebone Franks Casket, {{thought to have been}} produced in Northumbria in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs. There is only one known pagan burial in Scotland, at Dalmeny Midlothian, which contains a necklace of beads similar to those found in mid-seventh-century southern England. Other isolated finds include a gold object from Dalmeny, shaped like a truncated pyramid, with filigree and garnet, similar to sword harness mounts found at Sutton Hoo. There is also a bun-shaped loom from Yetholm, Roxburghshire and a ring with an Anglian runic inscription. From eastern Scotland there is a seventh-century sword pommel from Culbin Sands, Moray and the Burghead drinking horn mount. After Christianisation in the seventh century artistic styles in Northumbria, which then reached to the Firth of Forth, interacted with those in Ireland and what is now Scotland {{to become part of the}} common style historians have identified as Insular or Hiberno-Saxon.|$|E
5|$|Only {{fragments}} of artifacts survive from the Brythonic speaking kingdoms of southern Scotland. Pictish {{art can be}} seen in the extensive survival of carved Pictish stones, particularly in the north and east of the country. These display a variety of recurring images and patterns, as at Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno (Angus). There are a few survivals of Pictish silver, notably a number of massive neck-chains including the Whitecleuch Chain, and also the unique silver plaques from the cairn at Norrie's Law. Irish-Scots art from the kingdom of Dál Riata is much more difficult to identify, but may include items such as the Hunterston brooch, which with other items such as the Monymusk Reliquary, suggest that Dál Riata was one of the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed.

40|$|International audienceExcavated in 2008 and {{covering}} {{an area of}} 3700 m(2) {{in preparation for the}} development of a large supermarket, the site of Pen Hoat Salaun yields evidence for two occupations, one attributable to the Bertheaume group (Early Mesolithic, 8300 - 8200 years BP), and the other to the end of the Early Neolithic (4800 - 4700 years BP). Located at the top of a slope at the edge of a plateau and overlooking a graben, the site commands an extensive panoramic view towards the north-east. The granitic substrate is capped by a cover of Quaternary surface formations, no more than 1 m in thickness and consisting of three distinct sandy-loam levels (US 1 - 3). The two lowermost levels are made up of reworked and colluvial materials, derived from the granitic sands and residual loessal formations of the plateau, whereas the uppermost level corresponds to the present-day soil horizon developed on recent agricultural colluvium. Moreover, excavation of this cover has led to the discovery of lithic objects attributed primarily to the Mesolithic in a lower archaeological level (US 3), while a mixture of fragments attributed to the Mesolithic and Neolithic is found in a higher archaeological level (US 2). This latter lithic material is associated with ceramic shards, but to a lesser degree (than in US 3). A total of 763 shards are recorded, showing bowl or bottle-like forms; the decorations are dominated by panels of embossed buttons, cordons - including one small part with finger-printed ornament - and ribs in relief, as well as impressions made with a blunt point or spatula. Although some characters can be distinguished with different proportions in the two lithic assemblages, there is also a clear lack of tools characteristic of the early or middle Neolithic period (arrowheads, borers and burins). Moreover, we note the disappearance in this area of the laminar debitage sequences so characteristic of the Villeneuve Saint-Germain culture, in favour of the production of flakes. This sparse lithic assemblage is accompanied by a muscovite-sillimanite gneiss axehead and a fragment of a schist/wackestone ring. The former item belongs to a context - also known as carnacean - in which axeheads have high social value, with a possible alpine origin in view of its type (probably repolished Begude), even though such rocks are also present in the Armorican Massif. A serpentinite ring-disc discovered in 2007 in a trial trench 100 m south-west of the excavation area appears to represent another <b>exceptional</b> <b>item,</b> possibly originating in the Alps, though a local provenance is discussed. Although not strictly associated with the shards, four radiocarbon dates obtained on burned brushwood indicate an age range of 4800 4700 years BP. While it is out of the question to speak in terms of an association, the Pen Hoat Salaun assemblage offers a good outline of stylistic and technonolgical features at the end of the early Neolithic, as a prelude to the Castellic.

40|$|Â AbstractÂ Persian as {{the second}} {{language}} {{of the world of}} Islam is closely related to the teachings of this divine religion, so learning Persian besides Islamic and Shia teachings would be helpful for Islamic scholars. In this regard, Jameâat al-Mostafa al-âalamiye {{in the context of the}} Persian language tries to train Islamic scholars, translators and missioners. Â Center of language education and Islamic teachings which is the subset of Jameâat al-Mostafa, has formulated a collection of eight books named Persian to Persian teaching which is taught in different centers of Jameâat al-Mostafa inside and outside of the country. Â High goals of this Shia association represents the importance of authoring and analyzing education books. So their accuracy needs more attention and research. This essay aimed at describing and grammatical analyzing of this educational series. The present study deals with the importance and methods of teaching grammar to non-Persian speakers after introducing the Jameâat al-Mostafa al-âalamiye; also, besides introducing the required grammatical issues, it describes eight volumes books of teaching Persian-to-Persian grammatically. Â Then the grammatical difficulties of these books are investigated in ten separate sections with giving some examples. The study ends with providing some strategies to improve the grammatical issues of this educational set and other books of teaching Persian language to non-Persian speakers. Â In the early years after the Islamic revolution, some foreign students came to Iran to study Islamic studies so the supervisory board of non-Iranian students was established to answer and to organize their educational and livelihood status in 1979. âJameâat al-Mostafa al-âalamiyeâ was founded in Qom and other cities after the continuous changes in 2007. This center tries to grow the Islamic scholar, translator, and missionary by teaching Persian language; in this way, center of language and Islamic studies considered as a subset of Jameâat al-Mostafa has published a set of teaching Persian- to- Persian in eight books that are teaching in different centers of Jameâat al-Mostafa in country and abroad now. The valuable goals of this Shiite institution in spreading Islam show the importance and sensitivity of writing and analyzing its educational books so it is clear that their rightness and accuracy need more attention and study. The purpose of this study is to describe and to do grammatical criticism on this educational set. In this study, after expressing the importance of grammar in teaching Persian language to non-Persian speakers, the methods of writing grammar in Persian language and the required grammatical issues for the students whose native language is not Persian will be dealt. Teaching Persian language in Persian-to-Persian books is directly done without using the intermediate language or translation. These books have an instructional, traditional, and inductive approach, grammatically. In this set, grammatical rules are presented in a part of book namely "points". Examples of each section are presented in the form of sentence not text and they are usually ended with the related exercises. However, before dealing with the grammatical problems of this set, linguistic concepts and grammatical rules of every book are described in separate tables. In this study, the grammatical problems of teaching Persian-to Persian books are presented in ten separate sections and some examples are suggested for each one includingÂ  1. Grammatical incorrectness Â  2. Incomplete definition of grammatical rules and points Â  3. Grammatical incompleteness Â  4. Repetition of materials Â  5. Ignoring the logical order and sequence of grammatical topics Â  6. The presence of confusion in naming grammatical terms Â  7. Grammatical patterns Â  8. The presence of confusion in grammatical footnotes Â  9. The writing and editing difficulties in expressing grammatical issues Â  10. Incomplete pictures Â By considering this study, the following items are recommended to improve the grammatical structure of teaching Persian-to-Persian: Â The review of design and curriculum of grammar and its compatibility with the updated materials by using the specialists' board of Persian grammar, teaching Persian language and its grammar based on the students' needs of learning these books to use Persian texts, cultures, to get four language skills, compatibility of grammatical concepts, and to adopt the same approach in designing and improving them, dependence on learning grammatical issues based on simply grammatical, scientific, and single-legal patterns, presenting efficiently grammatical issues to increase the students' four skills, using context especially communicational and conversational texts useful for students in teaching Persian grammar to understand the value of grammatical structures and their role, the sequence of materials and grammatical structures based on their frequency in language, ignoring the <b>exceptional</b> and rare <b>items</b> in grammatical issues, considering and emphasizing on teaching method from easy up to hard to make motivation and self-confidence in students and preparing them for next teachings, to cause the study of the regular grammar being delayed to advanced stages...|$|R

We examine the impact of FRS 3 on classificatory smoothing by UK firms and document a significant rise in this practice post-FRS 3.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{assume that}} the most appropriate way to express the systematic aspects of language {{is in terms of}} a set of rules. For instance, there is a systematic relationship between the written and spoken forms of most English words (e. g., GAVE  ¢¡¤£¦¥¨§�©� ¡), and this relationship can be expressed in terms of a fairly concise set of grapheme-phoneme correspondence (GPC) rules (e. g., G ¢¡¤£� ¡, A E  ¢¡�¥¨§� ¡, V  ¢¡�©� ¡). In addition to being able to generate accurate pronunciations of so-called regular words, such rules also provide a straightforward account of how skilled readers apply their knowledge to novel items—for example, in pronouncing word-like nonwords (e. g., MAVE  ¢¡���¥�§�©� ¡). Most linguistic domains, however, are only partially systematic. Thus, there are many English words whose pronunciations violate the standard GPC rules (e. g., HAVE  ¢¡�����©� ¡). Given that skilled readers can pronounce such exception words correctly, GPC rules alone are insufficient. More generally, skilled language performance at virtually every level of analysis— phonological, morphological, lexical, syntactic—requires both effective handling of <b>exceptional</b> <b>items</b> and the ability to generalize to novel forms. In the domain of reading, there are three broad responses to this challenge. The first, adopted by traditional “dual-route ” theories (Besner, this volume; Besner &...|$|E

40|$|This paper, for {{the first}} time, classifies {{narrative}} information into complementary and supplementary. For {{the purpose of the}} paper, complementary narrative information is defined as that information which refers to specific numbers presented in the statutory accounts (profit and loss and balance sheet). Non?specific narrative information is classified as supplementary. Having made the distinction and provided reasons for such a distinction the study investigates the extent of complementary narrative commentaries on numbers from the statutory accounts. The study also investigates which company?specific characteristics are associated with the extent of complementary narrative commentaries. An index consisting of 46 items which must be reported in the statutory accounts was used to measure the extent of complementary narrative commentaries in the annual reports of 170 listed UK companies. The findings suggest that, on average, the companies comment on 39. 9 % of the numbers appearing in their statutory accounts. Using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model, the results indicate that company size, gearing, profitability, liquidity ratio, the presence of <b>exceptional</b> <b>items,</b> and substantial institutional investment are significantly associated with the extent of complementary narrative commentaries. However, auditor type, directors’ share ownership, and the proportion of non?executive directors are not significantly associated with the extent of complementary narrative commentaries.

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in high income countries to control expenditure on medicines by improving the rationale for their selection. However, in middle income countries with differing priorities and needs, {{little attention has been}} paid to this issue. In this paper we explore the policies and processes for the selection and use of medicines in a group of hospitals in Chile, a middle income country which has recently joined the OECD. Methods A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was used. A national survey questionnaire was distributed to investigate the role and operation of PTCs (Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committees). Interviews were conducted with key actors in the selection of medicines in large urban public hospitals. Results The national survey had an overall response rate of 42 % (83 out of 196), whilst 7 out of 14 hospitals participated in the qualitative study. High complexity hospitals are large urban hospitals; all of which claim to have a working PTC. The pharmacy offices are mainly involved in dispensing medicines with little involvement in clinical duties. The interviews conducted suggest that the formulary of all the hospitals visited is no more than a stock list. PTCs are unable to influence the prescribing practices of doctors. Members do not feel prepared to challenge the opinions of specialists requesting a certain drug, and decisions are based primarily on costs. The inclusion of medicines in the clinical practice of hospitals is as a result of doctors bypassing the PTC and requesting the purchase of <b>exceptional</b> <b>items,</b> some of which are included in the formulary if they are widely used. Conclusions There is an urgent need to develop medicine policies in hospitals in Chile. The procedures used to purchase medicines need to be revised. Central guidance for PTCs could help ensure a more rational use of medicines. PTCs need to be empowered to design formularies which cover all the clinical needs of doctors, training members in the analysis of scientific evidence beyond their own specialities. An influential PTC can take the appropriate measures and design workable policies to enforce a cost effective-use of resources. </p...|$|E
