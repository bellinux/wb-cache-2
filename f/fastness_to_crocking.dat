30|$|The wash {{fastness}} {{results of}} all samples {{were found to}} be in the range of fairly good to good ratings of 3 – 5. Mordanting with different metal salts has significantly altered wash fastness ratings of dyed woolen yarn. Alum and ferrous sulfate positively affected the color change in wash fastness results but tin mordants reduce the rating up to 3. Fastness results are also proving the better complexation of iron mordant with wool fiber and dye molecules. The color change in dyed wool of all samples was found to be from fairly good to good level rating of 3 – 4, whereas the color staining on wool and cotton was found to be very good rating of 5. Color <b>fastness</b> <b>to</b> <b>crocking</b> was found to be within the range of 3 – 5 means fairly good to good level in all dyed yarn samples. Woolen yarn samples dyed with low concentration showed better wash and rub fastness properties. This is attributed to the fact that at higher dye concentration there is leeching of color from dyed wool samples due to physical adsorption. The results of present study are in good correlation with previously reported work by Ali et al. (2016).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} natural dye {{extracted from}} stink bean pod (Parkia speciosa Hassk.) which was dyed on the silk fabric. The mordants as aluminum potassium sulfate, iron chloride, sodium hydroxide and mud {{were used to}} dye fabric using three different dyeing methods: pre-mordanting, meta-mordanting and post-mordanting. The color <b>fastness</b> <b>to</b> washing, water, perspiration, light and crocking of the dyed samples was determined according to AATCC test methods. In this study the UV-protection properties on silk fabrics were investigated. The chemical functional groups of the dyes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results revealed that the dyeing silk fabrics with stink beans pod were fair <b>to</b> good <b>fastness</b> <b>to</b> washing and <b>crocking</b> and very poor <b>to</b> poor light <b>fastness</b> {{with the exception of}} samples mordanted with iron chloride. The water and perspiration fastness ratings were fair to good. Silk fabrics mordanted with iron chloride and dyed with stink bean usually showed good UV-protection levels even if undyed. These extracts gave polyphenolic, betalain dye and chlorophyll content. Therefore, it was suggested that stink bean pod has the potential in producing functional dyes that could be imparted into the silk dyeing natural colorant system...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{the effect}} of enzyme {{treatment}} using neutral cellulase on the color fading property of cotton denim fabric was studied. Four enzyme processing parameters namely treatment temperature, treatment time, pH value, and agitation were considered. To investigate the optimum condition for the enzyme treatment, an orthogonal analysis was used and, based on the K/S summation value (K/S Sum), the optimum condition for enzyme treatment {{in this study was}} treatment temperature = 50 °C; treatment time = 30 min; pH value = 8; and agitation = 50 steel balls (simulated mild agitation) for the best color fading achievement with desired worn and aged effect.

40|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} plasma (APP) {{treatment was}} applied as a pretreatment process {{to enhance the}} deposition of printing paste {{in order to improve}} the final colour properties of digital ink-jet printed cotton fabrics. Three printing pastes containing natural polymers, i. e. (1) sodium alginate, (2) chitosan and (3) sodium alginate-chitosan mixture, were prepared separately. After APP treatment, cotton fabric was padded with different printing pastes prior to digital ink-jet printing. Experimental results showed that APP pretreatment could increase the colour yield of the digital ink-jet printed cotton fabric significantly even after washing. In addition, other properties such as colour <b>fastness</b> <b>to</b> <b>crocking,</b> colour fastness to laundering, outline sharpness and anti-bacterial properties were also improved when compared with those of the control cotton fabric printed without APP pretreatment. However, the influence of printing paste on the colour properties of the digital ink-jet printed cotton fabrics depended very much on the composition of the printing paste. The scanning electron microscope images evidenced that the APP treatment could enhance the deposition of printing paste on the cotton fabric surface as proved qualitatively by both the contact angle and wetting time measurement as well as quantitatively by both the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and carboxyl group/nitrogen content analysis.

40|$|Identification of viable vat dye {{candidates}} of a trichromatic series (compatible red, {{yellow and}} blue colorants) plus an orange {{based on the}} developed single-stage acid leuco vat dyeing process for unmodified polypropylene (PP) flat woven fabrics has been achieved with adequate fastness properties to washing, crocking and dry-cleaning: C. I. Vats Orange 1, Yellow 2 and Red 1 have been certified, whereas Vat Blue 6 is a marginal candidate. Vat Blue 1 has been demonstrated {{to be a viable}} colorant for dyeing of PP fiber as a single colorant. Molecular dynamics simulation and solubility parameter (SP) approaches have been utilized to screen the potential vat dye candidates for generic PP coloration. Experimental K/S results have exhibited good correlation with the predicted mixing energy of acid leuco vat dyes-PP fiber and the calculated dyes' SP's. The low SP/mixing energy acid leuco vat dyes (e. g., C. I. Vat Red 1) have shown better color-yield/fastness properties than the high SP/mixing energy vat dyes (e. g., C. I. Vat Brown 1), exhibiting that increasing difference of SP between the vat dye and the PP fiber, coupled with a higher mixing energy of dye-PP blend, resulted in decreased interactions between the two. For example, C. I. Vat Brown 1 with its high SP and calculated mixing energy with PP gave least color yield than the certified vat dyes, all with lower SP's and mixing energies. Cross-section micrographs of the dyed fibers revealed the absence of "ring-dyeing". Experimentally determined kinetic parameters such as affinity of dyeing and heat of dyeing quantified the presence of interaction between acid leuco vat dyes and PP fiber. Tensile test and X-ray crystallinity results have confirmed that dyeing process did not alter the tensile strength and modulus of the dyed PP textiles significantly. PP Fabrics dyed with simulated continuous dyeing processes (pad-steam and pad-dry heat) demonstrated good color yields and levelness with adequate <b>fastness</b> <b>to</b> <b>crocking,</b> washing and dry cleaning.

30|$|The {{surface and}} {{cross-sectional}} morphologies of coated fabric were observed using Philips XL 30 {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM). The chemical composition of plated films was determined using an elemental analysis device incorporated with SEM instrument. The crystal structure of metalized fabric before and after nickel electroless plating was also investigated using X-ray diffraction (PW 1840 diffractometer, Philips) with Cu Kα radiation operating at 40  kV and 35  mA, and a scan rate of 0.1 °/s. Raman spectra were characterized by Raman spectrometer (LabRam- 1 B, France, JY Co. Ltd). The spectra collected with a spectral resolution of 1.5  cm− 1 in the backscattering mode, using the 632.8  nm excitation line of a Helium/Neon laser. The nominal power of the laser polarized 500 : 1 was 20  mW. A Gaussian/Lorentzian-fitting function was used to obtain band position and intensity. The incident laser beam was focused onto the specimen surface through a 100 × microscopic objective lens, forming a laser spot of approximately 5  μm in diameter, using a capture time of 50  s. The Raman signals obtained with the half wave plate were rotated at 170 ° with a confocal hole set at 1100  μm and the slit set at 300  μm. The electronic balance (HR 200, Japan) {{was used to measure}} the percentage of the weight change for the coated fabric compared to neat fabric. The thickness of deposits qualitatively measures by weight gain method and further confirms by metallographic cross sections of the deposits by scanning or optical microscope. The color fastness of treated fabrics was evaluated separately based on standard testing method of the ISO 105 -A 02 : 1993 (color <b>fastness</b> <b>to</b> <b>crocking</b> under dry and wet conditions) and ISO 105 -C 06 : 1994 (color fastness to laundering). The surface resistances of each sample were measured five times for each sample with AATCC 76 - 1995 standard test method. The two 2  ×  3  cm 2 copper electrodes separated by 1.5  cm were placed on the each specimen and a constant 10  N force applies onto the plated fabrics. The resistance was recorded with multimeter (ADM 552 R, Arma Ltd., Iran). Surface resistivity (R s) expressed in ohms/square is calculated by equation of R = R s (l × A/w) where R is the resistance in ohms, L (cm) is the distance between electrodes, w (cm) is the width of the each electrode, and A is the fabric area in cm 2.|$|E
