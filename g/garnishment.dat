2500|$|Starting in 1982, {{dividends}} {{from the}} fund's annual growth {{have been paid}} out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200 [...] "Resource Rebate"). Every year, the state legislature takes out 8% from the earnings, puts 3% back into the principal for inflation proofing, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans. To qualify for the Permanent Fund Dividend, one must {{have lived in the}} state for a minimum of 12 months, maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences, and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil <b>garnishment.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{many states}} {{when the person}} is an {{employee}} or appointee of a governmental unit the writ is called a Writ of Sequestration. These are processed by the courts {{in the same manner}} as <b>garnishments</b> and are subject to the same wage exemptions.|$|R

[...] "Never mind expense," [...] he had argued in the old days with Parkinson when that slack mariner could see no reason for making the Vega seaworthy; [...] "you sail the schooner, I pay the bills." [...] And so with his sons and daughters. It had been for them to get the education and never mind the expense. Harold, the eldest-born, had gone to Harvard and Oxford; Albert and Charles had gone through Yale in the same classes. And the daughters, from the eldest down, had undergone their preparation at Mills Seminary in California and passed on to Vassar, Wellesley, or Bryn Mawr. Several, having so desired, had had the finishing touches put on in Europe. And from all the world Ah Chun's sons and daughters returned to him to suggest and advise in the <b>garnishment</b> of the chaste magnificence of his residences. Ah Chun himself preferred the voluptuous glitter of Oriental display; but he was a philosopher, and he clearly saw that his children's tastes were correct according to Western standards.|$|E
6000|$|The {{day after}} Fleda {{received}} this letter she {{had occasion to}} go into a big shop in Oxford Street--a journey that she achieved circuitously, first on foot and then by the aid of two omnibuses. The second of these vehicles put her {{down on the side of}} the street opposite her shop, and while, on the curbstone, she humbly waited, with a parcel, an umbrella, and a tucked-up frock, to cross in security, she became aware that, close beside her, a hansom had pulled up short, in obedience to the brandished stick of a demonstrative occupant. This occupant was Owen Gereth, who had caught sight of her as he rattled along and who, with an exhibition of white teeth that, from under the hood of the cab, had almost flashed through the fog, now alighted to ask her if he couldn't give her a lift. On finding that her destination was only over the way he dismissed his vehicle and joined her, not only piloting her to the shop, but taking her in; with the assurance that his errands didn't matter, that it amused him to be concerned with hers. She told him she had come to buy a trimming for her sister's frock, and he expressed an hilarious interest in the purchase. His hilarity was almost always out of proportion to the case, but it struck her at present as more so than ever; especially when she had suggested that he might find it a good time to buy a <b>garnishment</b> of some sort for Mona. After wondering an instant whether he gave the full satiric meaning, such as it was, to this remark, Fleda dismissed the possibility as inconceivable. He stammered out that it was for her he would like to buy something, something [...] "ripping," [...] and that she must give him the pleasure of telling him what would best please her: he couldn't have a better opportunity for making her a present--the present, in recognition of all she had done for Mummy, that he had had in his head for weeks.|$|E

Duties and services include, but are not limited to, serving court documents (including summons and complaint, restraining orders, subpoenas, and contempt citations), transferring minors in emergency ex parte custody matters, enforcing judgments (including bank executions, wage <b>garnishments,</b> and seizure of property), evictions, serving tax warrants, and arresting individuals on bench warrants.|$|R
50|$|In {{an order}} issued May 9, 2007, {{the trial court}} found that the Bank was no in {{compliance}} with the <b>garnishment</b> statute and that it failed to provide any notice of an offset of right to offset within the required time period. The court further found that the Bank violated an order of the court contained in the writ by allowing checks drawn on funds deposited after the writ of <b>garnishment</b> was issued to clear rather than using them to pay the <b>garnishment.</b> As a result, the trial court ordered the Bank to pay the entire sum remaining on the <b>garnishment,</b> $38,769.71, as well as Bud Bailey’s attorney fees.|$|E
5000|$|The {{other type}} of <b>garnishment,</b> also known as {{attachment}} (or attachment of earnings), requires the garnishee to deliver all the defendant's money and/or property {{in the hands of}} the garnishee at the time of service of process to the court, to be paid over to the plaintiff. Since this type of <b>garnishment</b> is not continuing in nature, but is not subject to the type of restrictions that apply to wage <b>garnishment,</b> it is most often used against banks, or other persons or companies that incur liquidated obligations in the regular course of business.

50|$|At present four U.S. states—Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas—do {{not allow}} wage <b>garnishment</b> at all except for tax-related debt, child support, federally {{guaranteed}} student loans, and court-ordered fines or restitution. The federal <b>garnishment</b> limit (with some exceptions like child support and student loans) {{on a weekly}} basis is the lower of (A) 25% of one's disposable earnings (what's left after mandatory tax deductions), or (B) the total amount by which one's weekly wage exceeds thirty times the federal hourly minimum wage. Several other states observe maximum thresholds that are lower than the maxima provided by federal law. States may also prohibit <b>garnishment</b> altogether in certain circumstances. For example, in Florida the wages of a person who provides more than half the support for a child or other dependent are exempt from <b>garnishment</b> altogether (though this is subject to waiver). Loans and negotiations with creditors can also help debtors to avoid wage <b>garnishment.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 are the {{efficient}} bankruptcy chapters often used by most individuals. The chapters which almost always apply to consumer debtors are chapter 7, {{known as a}} [...] "straight bankruptcy", and chapter 13, which involves an affordable plan of repayment. An important feature applicable to all types of bankruptcy filings is the automatic stay. The automatic stay means that the mere request for bankruptcy protection automatically halts most lawsuits, repossessions, foreclosures, evictions, <b>garnishments,</b> attachments, utility shut-offs, and debt collection activity.|$|R

Each country has laws as to what must be included on a pay slip, but which would typically include details of the gross wages for the pay period and the taxes and any other deductions the employer is required to make by law; as well as other personal deductions such as retirement plan or pension contributions, insurances, <b>garnishments,</b> or charitable contributions taken out of the gross amount to arrive at the final net amount of the pay, also including the year to date totals in some circumstances.|$|R
50|$|Businesses {{may decide}} to {{outsource}} their payroll functions to an outsourcing service like a Payroll service bureau or a fully managed payroll service. These can normally reduce the costs involved in having payroll trained employees in-house {{as well as the}} costs of systems and software needed to process a payroll. Where this may reduce the cost for some companies many will foot a bigger bill to outsource their payroll if they have a special designed payroll program or payouts for their employees. In many countries, business payrolls are complicated in that taxes must be filed consistently and accurately to applicable regulatory agencies. Restaurant payrolls which typically include tip calculations, deductions, <b>garnishments</b> and other variables, can be difficult to manage especially for new or small business owners.|$|R

40|$|This note {{evaluates the}} {{hypothesis}} that employment policies which mandate suspension or discharge for multiple <b>garnishments</b> are racially discriminatory. It considers the methods of challenge such as a claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the lack of consensus between {{the courts and the}} Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and also emerging issues. The note finds that the legality of employment practices imposing disciplinary action against garnished employees is left uncertain. Proof of a disproportionate effect on minorities employees may be adequate, although a satisfactory showing of business necessity may be a defense against a claim of a Title VII violation. What constitutes a 2 ̆ 2 satisfactory 2 ̆ 2 showing of business necessity varies by jurisdiction but the note concludes that with the trend towards finding such practices racially suspect, employers should reconsider their policies...|$|R

The hot deep fried vadas are first put in water and then transferred to thick beaten yogurt. For best results, the vadas are soaked {{for at least a}} couple of hours before serving. Additionally you may put some golden raisins in the vada batter to have more flavour and richness. To increase the flavor, they may be topped with coriander or mint leaves, chili powder, crushed black pepper, chaat masala, cumin, shredded coconut, green chilis, boondi, thinly sliced fresh ginger or pomegranate. Sweeter curd is preferred in some places in India, especially in Maharashtra and Gujarat, although the garnishing remains the same. A combination of coriander and tamarind chutneys are often used as <b>garnishments</b> in addition to those mentioned above.|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{analysis}} of pottery traditions of the population associated with the existence of “long houses” on Staraya-Maina hillfort (Ulyanovsk Oblast), dated by the Great Migration Period. The research is based on the ceramic collection found on the hillfort during the excavations in 1990 – 1991. This paper presents a typological description of vessels and the results of technological analysis conducted by the author according to A. A. Bobrinsky’s method. The analysis revealed two massive pottery traditions, one of which was widely known on Imenkovo culture settlements, while the second one was a new discovery. The author suggests that this group of ceramics might be associated with an inflow of population from the Middle Oka region and from the Oka-Sura region in the fifth century AD, which brought the typical complex of <b>garnishments</b> of Ryazan-Oka type to the Middle Volga region...|$|R
