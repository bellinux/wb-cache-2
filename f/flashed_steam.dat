They require fluid temperatures of at least 180 °C, usually more. This {{is the most common}} type of station in operation today. Flash Steam plants use geothermal reservoirs of water with temperatures greater than 360 °F (182 °C). The hot water flows up through wells in the ground under its own pressure. As it flows upward, the pressure decreases and some of the hot water boils into steam. The steam is then separated from the water and used to power a turbine/generator. Any leftover water and condensed steam may be injected back into the reservoir, making this a potentially sustainable resource. At The Geysers in California, twenty years of power production had depleted the groundwater and operations were substantially reduced. To restore some of the former capacity, water injection was developed.|$|E

It is most effective to remove water with the highest level of impurities; and such water is found where steam separates in the steam drum {{at the top of the}} boiler. There are two types of surface blowdown fittings. The simpler is a pipe entering the steam drum at the normal water level. A more sophisticated skimmer arrangement attaches a swivel joint to the pipe for a short length of pipe suspended by a float.

Using the latest information from the Geothermal This report {{contains the}} results of a feasibility and risk study performed by Bechtel National, Inc. and the Ben Holt Company under contract to the San Diego Gas and Electric Company (SDG&E). The purpose of the study was to define the most technically feasible and lowest cost near-term energy conversion process for a 50 MWe geothermal power plant at the Salton Sea known Geothermal Resource Area (KGRA). Using the latest information from the Geothermal Loop Experimental Facility (GLEF), which is currently in operation at the Salton Sea KGRA, conceptual designs, capital cost estimates, and busbar energy production cost estimates were developed for power plants employing several versions of <b>flashed</b> <b>steam</b> and flash binary energy conversion processes. A power plant and well field risk analysis was also performed. The results show that while the <b>flashed</b> <b>steam</b> plant has the advantage of lower plant capital cost, the brine flow rate required by the binary plant is lower. This results in busbar energy production costs for the two plants that are the same. However, the risk analysis indicates that the technical risks are less for the <b>flashed</b> <b>steam</b> further work at the GLEF. The version of the <b>flashed</b> <b>steam</b> process with lowest energy production cost was the dual-flash process with three 50 percent capacity trains of flash tanks with unmodified brine. Thus, it was determined that GLEF testing in the immediate future should be directed primarily toward this process. A series of GLEP tests and further studies were defined for the purpose of alleviating or minimizing the major risks associated with the flash steam process. The most important risks were found to be those associated with brine handling. They include producing the brine, carrying it through the plant, and injecting it into the subsurface formation.

We focus on the design and maintenance of the power plant that led to the achievement of high plant capacity factors for Units No. 1 and 2 since commercial operation began in 1973. For this study, plant capacity factor is the ratio of the average load on the machines or equipment for the period of time considered to the capacity rating of the machines or equipment. The plant capacity factor is the annual gross output in GWh compared to 657 GWh (2 x 37. 5 MW x 8760 h).

30|$|The 2014 {{eruption}} was a phreatic one {{in origin}} {{as it did}} not contain evidence of juvenile magmatism (e.g., Minami et al. 2015). One of the dominant mechanisms of a phreatic eruption involves sudden decompression of superheated water, followed by an explosion because of the generation of {{a large amount of}} <b>steam</b> (<b>flash</b> <b>steam)</b> (e.g., Browne and Lawless 2001; Hedenquist and Henley 1985; Mayer et al. 2015; Thiery and Mercury 2009; Yamamoto et al. 1999). In engineering, similar explosive phenomena are referred to as BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion) (Abbasi and Abbasi 2007). An eruption model can be inferred from the reconstructed eruption sequence as follows: (1) Considering that new craters formed, the early eruption column contained a large amount of tephra (rock fragments and altered clay). The density of the eruption column was therefore high and PDCs occurred by a collapse of the eruption column under its own weight (Phase 1). According to Yamamoto et al. (1999) and Yamamoto (2014), PDCs occur during phreatic eruptions when the rock/hot water ratio is large. Yamamoto (2014) suggested that this occurs during the early phases of new crater formation. PDCs during the phreatic eruptions in 1888 at Bandai, in 1900 at Adatara, and in 2012 at Te Maari occurred at the time of formation or expansion of a crater (Fujinawa et al. 2006; Breard et al. 2014; Yamamoto et al. 1999). The sequence of the 2014 eruption is consistent with this theory. (2) During Phase 1, the temperature of PDCs with an ash cloud was 30 – 100  °C; the water contained in the PDCs was in the vapor state (<b>flash</b> <b>steam).</b> (3) Thereafter, the temperature of the plume decreased by the effect of adiabatic expansion as the eruption column rose. As a result, the internal temperature of the plume decreased to the dew point temperature to precipitate muddy rain. (4) Finally, muddy hot water, which did not transform to <b>flash</b> <b>steam,</b> overflowed from the craters. Considering the process of liquid water <b>flashing</b> to <b>steam</b> (e.g., Hedenquist and Henley 1985; Mayer et al. 2015) and the conditions of PDCs that result from a phreatic eruption (e.g., Yamamoto et al. 1999), our observations suggest that this model is consistent with the proposed sequence of events at Ontake.|$|R
