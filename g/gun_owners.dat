5|$|A {{gun in the}} Czech Republic is {{available}} to anybody subject to acquiring a shall issue firearms license first. Gun licenses may be obtained in a way very similar to a driving license – by passing a gun proficiency exam, medical examination and having a clean criminal record. Unlike in most other European countries, the Czech gun legislation also permits a citizen to carry a concealed weapon for self-defense – 240,000 out of some 300,000 legal <b>gun</b> <b>owners</b> have concealed carry permit. The vast majority of Czech <b>gun</b> <b>owners</b> possess their firearms for protection, with hunting and sport shooting being less common.|$|E

5|$|It is {{generally}} not common for licensed <b>gun</b> <b>owners</b> to commit violent crimes with their guns, {{and most of the}} gun crimes are committed with illegal weapons that are beyond the control of the law. Annually, police investigate about 500 cases of illegal arming (with or without direct connection to committing other crime).|$|E

5|$|The Court {{makes it}} a federal crime for one lawful <b>gun</b> <b>owner</b> to buy a gun for another lawful <b>gun</b> <b>owner.</b> Whether or not that is a {{sensible}} result, the statutes Congress enacted do not support it—especially when, as is appropriate, we resolve ambiguity in those statutes {{in favor of the}} accused. I respectfully dissent.|$|R

5|$|The note further elaborates {{that unlike}} {{the rest of}} the EU, where most guns are owned for hunting, the vast {{majority}} of Czech <b>gun</b> <b>owners</b> possess firearms suitable for protection of life, health and property, explicitly mentioning, inter alia, semi-automatic rifles (which are subject to the proposed EU Gun Ban, see above).|$|E
5|$|Obligatory {{psychological}} {{testing for}} <b>gun</b> <b>owners</b> {{is a common}} subject of discussion, but {{it has always been}} rejected. Gun advocates point out that the nature of the tests and the parties responsible for them are not clear. It is also pointed out that it is unlikely that any psychological testing would reveal a potentially dangerous individual, because some famous killers in the past were members of the military or the law enforcement and passed very difficult psychological testing successfully.|$|E
5|$|Risks to {{internal}} security: According to Czech Ministry of Interior, the main {{danger of the}} proposal rested in massive transfer of now legal firearms into illegality, with up {{to hundreds of thousands}} of legal firearms entering black market. While the original Commission proposal would affect 40,000 – 50,000 firearms legally possessed by Czech citizens, Dutch EU Council Presidency proposal of 4 April 2016 would affect some 400,000 legally owned firearms, i.e. making half of all Czech legally owned firearms illegal with large proportion of <b>gun</b> <b>owners</b> likely refusing to surrender their firearms. The proposal as such is in direct contradiction with Ministry’s long-term objective of lowering of number of illegal firearms and of conducting effective supervision of firearm owners.|$|E

5|$|Interior Minister Anne Holmlund, who {{had ordered}} the {{original}} investigation into the police officers' conduct in the Kauhajoki incident, said that legislation would be introduced to aid police officers in accessing information about the {{mental and physical health}} of applicants for firearms licenses. This included, potentially, the ability to gain detailed information about an applicant's health, the right to subpoena records from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution, and the right to request further information if the applicant had a history of using medication. In addition to this, Holmlund said that the referencing process for being granted a firearms license would be intensified: two referees would have to be personally interviewed before a license was granted. Holmlund also pointed to legislation of the EU as her starting point. Other reforms, that she said would be introduced as late as spring 2009, included a national register of <b>gun</b> <b>owners.</b> Parliamentary debates occurred on whether to raise the age at which one could own a gun, or whether to put further checks in place, in September 2009.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Bevin {{criticized the}} Affordable Care Act {{and called for}} {{repealing}} it in its entirety. His proposed alternatives included allowing insurance providers to compete across state lines, capping damages awarded for pain and suffering, allowing individuals to purchase health insurance with pre-tax earnings, and providing federal block grants to states {{to allow them to}} cover individuals with pre-existing conditions. He opposed tax increases and the allocation of federal earmarks. He called for massive spending cuts in the federal bureaucracy, specifically the Department of Education and the Veterans Administration, and for reforming eligibility requirements for entitlement programs, including raising age requirements, imposing means tests, and ending federal benefits to illegal immigrants. He opposed U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War and the disbursement of foreign aid to countries that deny basic freedoms to their citizens or are guilty of human rights violations. He opposed federal agribusiness subsidies and warantless federal surveillance and called for simplifying the child adoption process. Endorsed by <b>Gun</b> <b>Owners</b> of America, he pledged to resist any restrictions on the types of guns or ammunition that citizens could purchase. A supporter of congressional term limits, Bevin signed a pledge authored by the non-profit U.S. Term Limits stating that, if elected, he would co-sponsor and vote for a bill restricting individuals to three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and two terms in the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, 1994, State Judicial Police arrested Puentes Pizaña in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, on a {{car theft}} charge. In an {{interview}} the following day, {{he said he was}} not guilty of Fischer's murder, and claimed he was at his mother's house in Matamoros when the murder occurred. He insisted that neither he nor Olivarez were <b>gun</b> <b>owners</b> or users. U.S. officials noted that it was unlikely for Mexico to extradite Puentes Pizaña since the extradition treaty between both countries did not cover Mexican nationals, and because Texas has the death penalty, which is outlawed in Mexico. Reynosa officials stated that Puentes Pizaña would have to face charges in Mexico before an extradition could be considered. Car theft sentences ranged from three to ten years in prison. Puentes Pizaña, on the other hand, argued that facing trial in the U.S. would not guarantee a fair trial. South Texas officials stated that there was a possibility for Puentes Pizaña to be tried in Mexico for Fischer's murder if an agreement was made between Texan and Tamaulipas state officials, though they said that trying him in the U.S. was unlikely.|$|E

25|$|As a backbencher, Allmand was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for stronger gun laws in Canada, supporting regulations on all Canadian <b>gun</b> <b>owners</b> and limiting access to all guns, including those for hunting. In 1971, he proposed a bill to only permit government stores to sell guns and to only allow Canadians to buy guns after applying for and receiving an application and passing a waiting period where the gun purchase was publicly listed so any Canadian could object to the purchase. Allmand also proposed requiring <b>gun</b> <b>owners</b> to compile annual reports on their gun use and {{the condition of the}} gun, and to return their guns to the government when no longer used. Allmand continued to advocate for gun control laws upon his appointment to cabinet.|$|E

50|$|Even when self-defense is justified, {{there can}} be serious civil or {{criminal}} liabilities related to self-defense when a concealed carry permit holder brandishes or fires his/her weapon. For example, if innocent bystanders are hurt or killed, there could be both civil and criminal liabilities even if the use of deadly force was completely justified. Some states technically allow an assailant who is shot by a <b>gun</b> <b>owner</b> to bring civil action. In some states, liability is present when a resident brandishes the weapon, threatens use, or exacerbates a volatile situation, or when the resident is carrying while intoxicated. It {{is important to note}} that simply pointing a firearm at any person constitutes felony assault with a deadly weapon unless circumstances validate a demonstration of force. A majority of states who allow concealed carry, however, forbid suits being brought in such cases, either by barring lawsuits for damages resulting from a criminal act on the part of the plaintiff, or by granting the <b>gun</b> <b>owner</b> immunity from such a civil suit if it is found that he or she was justified in shooting.|$|R
