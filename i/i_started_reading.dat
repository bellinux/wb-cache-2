Simonon later remarked, [...] "Once we had Joe on board it all started to come together." [...] Strummer {{introduced}} the band to his old school friend Pablo LaBritain, who sat in on drums during Strummer's first few rehearsals with the group. LaBritain's stint with the band {{did not last long}} (he subsequently joined 999), and Terry Chimes—whom Jones later referred to as [...] "one of the best drummers" [...] in their circle—became the band's regular drummer. In Westway to the World, Jones also says, [...] "I don't think Terry was officially hired or anything. He had just been playing with us." [...] Chimes did not take to Strummer at first: [...] "He was like twenty-two or twenty-three or something that seemed 'old' to me then. And he had these retro clothes and this croaky voice". Simonon came up with the band's name after they had briefly dubbed themselves the Weak Heartdrops and the Psychotic Negatives. He later explained the name's origin: [...] "It really came to my head when <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>reading</b> the newspapers and a word that kept recurring was the word 'clash', so I thought 'the Clash, what about that,' to the others.

And then all of the sudden the Christians came in and they tried to destroy their religion. It's great that they stayed within in their country's beliefs for their lyrics as well.

One day the late Dr. Stanley Jaks, who was a professional mentalist and a man I respected, tactfully suggested that it would make an interesting experiment if I deliberately gave readings opposite to what the lines indicated. I tried this out with a few clients. To my surprise and horror my readings were just as successful as ever. Ever since then I have been interested in the powerful forces that convince us, reader and client alike, that something is so when it really isn’t.|$|E

Adrian’s life story has been following the majority of the late 20 th century {{and the beginning of the}} 21 st, so his life has been changing in parallel with my own life story, although he is ten years younger than me.
