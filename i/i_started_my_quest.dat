40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{question}} of whether abstract adequacy levels for Machine Translation systems can be formulated. The con-cept of partially ordered set is introduced to describe the phenomenon that candidate translations often seem to differ along the lines of mu-tually incomparable dimensions. The central idea is that MT systems can be ranked in terms of abstract adequacy levels, in function of how well they cope with the problem of partially ordered candidate translations. 1 The notion of adequacy levels When <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>my</b> <b>quest</b> for abstract adequacy levels, it was brought to my attention that I should look for inspiration in the classical Generative Gram-mar framework, more precisely Chomsky ’ 57 and ’ 65. This would anchor my theory, and the resulting criteria, into a school of linguistic theory that cares about its meta-theoretical and epistemological status...|$|E
40|$|This is {{an account}} of the quest of a {{beginning}} lecturer in media publishing and ICT (higher education) who is trying to find {{the best way to make}} new students (more) information literate. <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>my</b> <b>quest</b> in the classroom, giving assignments to my students. They had to write an essay for which they were supposed to do research. During this process I collected their complaints about the problems they encountered. I wrote those down and analyzed them until I had a clear picture of their difficulties. To get a better idea of their educational background, I read several reports on the teaching of information literacy in Dutch primary and secondary education which entailed among other things longitudinal and quantitative research on the use of ICT in education and reports on the skills of pupils and teachers. Also I wanted to find out what people had already written about the shift in information seeking strategies and the impact of the digitized information age. This would help me put into perspective this so called ‘Google generation. In order to find an answer to next question on how technology changes human behavior, I read many articles, theses and books to help me discover the nature of the issues the student have with finding relevant information. I found many articles and many views on the topic and decided to focus on a few recurring themes, which I related to the different problems my students seemed to have. I would like to use the Bobcatsss conference as a testing ground upon which I shall introduce recommendations for improving information literacy and awareness among students...|$|E
