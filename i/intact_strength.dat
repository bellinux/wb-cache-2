These equations may give a good estimate of modulus given the correct input data, however it is difficult to obtain reliable <b>intact</b> <b>strength</b> or intact modulus values from laboratory tests on samples from highly disturbed rock masses. Because of this limitation, something that is commonly done in practice is to base intact modulus values on test results done on good samples of intact rock from locations with competent rock, using either laboratory measurements of intact modulus or on an assumed ratio between <b>intact</b> <b>strength</b> and modulus for a particular rock type. This ignores the possibility that the material in zones with poor rock will often be highly weathered, and it ignores the possibility that even without weathering a zone of poor rock may represent rock which simply has a lower <b>intact</b> <b>strength,</b> and that is why it became disturbed while zones of stronger rock on the same project did not.|$|E

The term rock mass incorporates the influence of both intact material and discontinuities on the overall strength and behavior of a discontinuous rock medium.

40|$|In this research, a novel, unique {{systematic}} {{procedure was}} implemented {{to investigate the}} influence of the fracture networks and confining stresses on the jointed coal mass strength (JCMS). Both a laboratory experimental scheme and a numerical modeling scheme were carried out at the 3 -D level. The laboratory experiments were performed to achieve the following three goals. Firstly, the geomechanical properties for the intact coal and coal discontinuities were estimated through the laboratory geomechanical property tests. Secondly, naturally existing fracture networks in the cubic coal blocks were first detected by the industrial Computed Tomography (CT) scanning technique and then quantified by the fracture tensor based methodology. Thirdly, polyaxial tests were conducted on the same cubic coal blocks to obtain the JCMS values under different confining stresses. With respect to the numerical modeling, PFC^ 3 D and 3 DEC software packages were used to simulate the polyaxial compression tests for intact and jointed cubic coal blocks, respectively. From more than twenty <b>intact</b> rock <b>strength</b> criteria, nine criteria were selected for this research. The <b>intact</b> coal <b>strength</b> data bank obtained from PFC^ 3 D modeling was used to evaluate the applicability of nine different <b>intact</b> rock <b>strength</b> criteria. A modified grid search (MGS) procedure is proposed and used to find the best fitting parameter values and calculate the coefficient of determination (R²) values for each criterion. These criteria are compared in detail using the following features: R² values, σ₁ - σ₂ plots for different σ₃, shapes on the deviatoric planes, linearity or nonlinearity on the meridian planes. The regression analysis and the MGS procedure were found to be equivalent in finding the best fitting parameter values for a certain <b>intact</b> rock <b>strength</b> criterion. Through the comparisons, the modified Wiebols-Cook and modified Lade criteria were found to provide the highest R² values and fit the <b>intact</b> coal <b>strength</b> data best on the σ₁ - σ₂ coordinate plane and meridian planes. Based on the appearances on the deviatoric plane, the nine <b>intact</b> rock <b>strength</b> criteria are categorized into three types: the single shear stress criteria, the octahedral shear stress criteria and the criteria incorporating the maximum principal shear stress and partial intermediate principal shear stress. The relative positions of the different criteria on two specific meridian planes are also discussed. The geometric model of the jointed coal block was first set up by incorporating the fracture network constructed from the CT scanning into the intact coal block using a modified fictitious joint procedure. The numerical parameter values of intact coal and coal discontinuities were then calibrated and validated through a trial and error procedure using the laboratory test results of some selected samples. Next the JCMS data bank was consummated by performing a four-phase numerical investigation on several jointed coal blocks having selected fracture networks and five additional artificial fracture networks under different confining stress combinations. Finally, a new empirical coal mass strength criterion was developed to estimate the JCMS values at the 3 -D level. The developed new model is capable of capturing the scale effect and anisotropic strength behaviors. It can also be applied to rock masses having approximately orthogonal fracture systems or for masses where fracture system can be reduced to an equivalent orthogonal fracture system. The following new contributions were made in this dissertation to advance the existing state-of-art on the dissertation topic: (a) A new, unique methodology as shown in Fig. 1. 1 incorporating the following aspects was used to develop a new 3 -D coal mass strength criterion: a complete set of geomechanical property tests, fracture network detection and quantification, polyaxial compression tests, numerical decomposition techniques; (b) A new procedure was developed to construct the fracture network in the coal cubes starting from CT scans to perform numerical modeling using 3 DEC. In this procedure, a modified fictitious joint framework was also proposed to extend the applicability of the original fictitious joint framework, which allows incorporating a large quantity of non-persistent joints with acceptable numerical calculation effort; (c) A new 3 -D coal mass strength criterion was developed to incorporate the fracture network and 3 -D confining stress system to capture the anisotropy and scale effect of coal mass strength. The proposed criterion not only includes {{the influence of the}} intermediate principal stress, which is ignored by some existing strength criteria, but also includes the intensity and orientation and size probability distributions of the fracture system explicitly by a fracture tensor based methodology, which is far more advanced than most of the current criteria that are based on rock mass classification systems having only scalar indices; (d) A modified grid search procedure was proposed and used to evaluate the applicability of nine different <b>intact</b> rock <b>strength</b> criteria. The best <b>intact</b> rock <b>strength</b> criteria applicable for the intact coal data obtained through PFC^ 3 D modeling were found by performing the most detailed <b>intact</b> rock <b>strength</b> criteria evaluation incorporating σ₁ - σ₂ - σ₃ plots and behaviors on the deviatoric and meridian planes, which improves the understanding of the available <b>intact</b> rock <b>strength</b> criteria...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{proposed}} a petrofabric classification {{of the rock}} mass domains and rock units encountered at the Birchtree Mine in the Thompson Nickel Belt (TNB), Manitoba. A program of field and laboratory studies has enabled the classification {{to be related to}} both geological and physical-mechanical properties. The classification has been aimed to advance TNB mining, mineral exploration and processing research. The thesis also considers the genesis and nature of both inherent and mining-induced rock mass damage at the Birchtree mine. An inherent rock mass damage index, D$ sb{ rm I}$, has been derived, based upon the rock unit <b>intact</b> <b>strength,</b> together with the quantity and conditions of any meso- and macro-structure present. D$ sb{ rm I}$ was closely related to rock mass domains. The physical characteristics of rock mass damage in mine developments induced both through drill-and-blast and roadheader mining were also monitored at the Birchtree Mine. This permitted the formation of a mining-induced rock mass damage index, D$ sb{ rm M}$. This was based upon decrease in the <b>intact</b> <b>strength,</b> half cast/tool marks, normalized scaling time, drift condition rating, and orientation of local structure. The type and intensity of mining-induced damage was found to be clearly related {{to the nature of the}} rock mass units and domains, as evident in their inherent damage. Two types of mining-induced damage mechanism were evident at Birchtree. Firstly, in the inherently weak rock mass ($ rm D sb{I} 10 $), such as the Metasedimentary Domain, the rock units are foliated with wider spaced joints. More energy is evidently required to fragment the rock mass through what was observed to be predominantly intact rock breakage controlled by foliation. These two damage mechanisms were also clearly evident from analysis of drift and fragmentation morphology survey data. The damage mechanism associated with both forms of mining appeared to be similar, although the intensity of machine-induced damage was significantly less. Rock mass damage related to ground stress redistribution was also observed. This thesis was motivated by the need to understand, control and minimize mining-induced damage, particularly in serpentized ultramafic domains which will host most of the future TNB mining at depth. It thus concludes by reviewing a proposed strategy for rock mass damage sensing and control in underground development and stoping, based upon the experience at Birchtree...|$|E

40|$|The glacial valley cross-profile has {{traditionally}} had its development attrituted {{to the physical}} properties of the eroding glacier, with the input of {{the properties of the}} eroded rock mass {{to the development of the}} valley system considered in a purely qualitative sense. The present study shows that the size of the outlet trough is directly related to the volume of ice discharged through it, estimated from the glacier contributing area. The trough size and morphological variations therein, can be partially attributed to the influence of the bedrock strength properties. Rock <b>intact</b> <b>strength</b> measures showed little relationship to the form of the glacial trough. However, a modified rock mass strength method was developed and applied to a variety of morphological and geological terrains in the vicinity of the Main Divide of the New Zealand Southern Alps. The results indicate a significant correlation between the cross-valley form and mass strength (RMS) properties of the eroded bedrock. The RMS controls on the development of the trough were: joint spacing, joint orientation and joint continuity. The trend suggests that weaker, more densely jointed bedrock tends to develop broader, flatter valleys. RMS with respect to subaerial processed controls the extent of post-glacial/interglacial modification of the trough slope, and development of zones of weakened slope rock that could be preferentially exploited by subsequent glazier re-advances. Due to their position astride the Alpine Fault, the New Zealand Southern Alps are subjected to high levels of shallow crustal horizontal stresses. The PHS directions are indicated by geodetic and earthquake first-motion studies, as well as conjugate shear joint and glacial valley orientations. The in situ stress field may control the location and extent of rock failure, when considered in conjunction with the high gravitational stresses induced by the extreme relief. Finite element models of typical glacial troughs suggest that rock <b>intact</b> <b>strength</b> properties control the likelihood and site of stress-induced bedrock failure. Thus, the shape of a glacial trough depends not only on the physical properties of the glacier, but on the geotechnical propertied of the host rockmass. The stress-induced controls on the site of rick mass failure are important controls on the locus of erosion. Following development of the glacial trough, considerable modification of the size and form of the valley cross-profile may occur depending on the mass strength of the de-buttressed slope rock...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{applicability}} of Artificial Neural Networks for predicting the stress-strain response of jointed rocks at varied confining pressures, strength properties and joint properties (frequency, orientation {{and strength of}} joints) has been studied in the present paper. The database is formed from the triaxial compression tests on different jointed rocks with different confining pressures and different joint properties reported by various researchers. This input data covers {{a wide range of}} rock strengths, varying from very soft to very hard. The network was trained using a 3 layered network with feed forward back propagation algorithm. About 85 % of the data was used for training and remaining 15 % for testing the predicting capabilities of the network. Results from the analyses were very encouraging and demonstrated that the neural network approach is efficient in capturing the complex stress-strain behaviour of jointed rocks. A single neural network is demonstrated to be capable of predicting the stress-strain response of different rocks, whose <b>intact</b> <b>strength</b> vary from 11. 32 MPa to 123 MPa and spacing of joints vary from 10 cm to 100 cm for confining pressures ranging from 0 to 13. 8 MPa. ...|$|E

Failure modes include femoral neck fracture and prosthesis loosening, {{which may be}} associated with medium-term bone adaptation, including femoral neck narrowing and densification around the prosthesis stem. Finite element modelling was used to indicate the effects of prosthesis sizing and positioning on the bone remodelling and fracture strength under a range of normal and traumatic loads, with the aim of understanding these failure modes better. The simulations predicted increased superior femoral neck stress shielding in young patients with small prostheses, which required shortening of the femoral neck to give an acceptable implant–bone interface. However, with a larger prosthesis, natural femoral head centre recreation in the implanted state was possible; therefore stress shielding was restricted to the prosthesis interior, and its extent was less sensitive to prosthesis orientation. With valgus orientation, the implanted neck strength was, at worst, within 3 per cent of its <b>intact</b> <b>strength.</b> The study suggests that femoral neck narrowing may be linked to a reduction in the horizontal femoral offset, occurring if the prosthesis is excessively undersized. As such, hip resurfacing should aim to reproduce the natural femoral head centre, and, for valgus prosthesis orientation, to avoid femoral neck fracture...|$|E

This reconnais-sance estimated the Profile’s in-place stability and its capacity to withstand blasting vibration from below. The work showed that 1) the dead weight of the Pro-file’s blocks cantilevered at their combined point of bearing created a delicate stability; 2) the Profile from the nose up was relatively more stable than from the upper lip and chin down; 3) the Profile was subject to toppling collapse if natural processes or dynamic stress disturbed it; and 4) blasting could take place beneath it if no vibration in excess of those in the ambient natural environment was allowed to reach the rock mass. Careful blast monitoring during construction of In-terstate 93 between 1985 and 1986 showed this vibra-tion objectivewas achieved.

Therefore, armed with a detailed {{description of}} the borehole or well wall from wireline log data (fracture density, in particular), one can assess rock mass strength and elastic modulus, important for a wide range of modelling scenarios (e.g. McClure and Horne 2013 and references therein) and stimulation strategies (Cipolla et al. 2008). We recommend that this simple, yet well-established, engineering method be used to characterise geothermal reservoirs worldwide to empirically establish its validity under reservoir and small diameter wellbore conditions. A possible technique would be to measure reservoir deformation during stimulation using distributed deformation measurements in wellbores using fibre optic technology as has been used for rock slope deformation monitoring (e.g. Moore et al. 2010). We also recommend that core and wellbore characterisation be undertaken such that fracture frequency, orientation, infilling and roughness for natural fractures are collected at a resolution that allows computation of the rock mass strength and stiffness criteria.

A good radiological study of the occipitocervical joint and first thoracic vertebra is key to a successful early diagnosis. However, cases might still fail to be diagnosed, leading to trouble. A case of post-traumatic subluxation at the C 7 vertebral level with an unusual neurological pattern is presented here. Case presentation A 35 -year-old farmer from the Sindh province of Pakistan presented to our neurology department after a fall 2 months earlier and complained of lower limb pain and difficulty in walking.

A structured methodology utilising a database of information obtained from 118 different rock mass classifications, together with consideration of the typical mechanisms of strata deformation within coal mines, was employed to determine the parameters of the Coal Measure strata that have the greatest influence on the engineering properties of the strata. These identified parameters have formed the basis of the Coal Mine Classification system. By comparison to a series of conceptual models of strata deformation that occur within the roof,floor, ribs of roadways and within the region of the coal face, relative importance weightings and rating scales for the identified classification parameters have been proposed. The anisotropic nature of the UK Coal Measures is characterised within the Coal Mine Classification by the calculation of separate ratings for directions parallel to and perpendicular to bedding. An appraisal of the optimum method of using the classification ratings, determined by the Coal Mine Classification, to predict the strength properties of individual strata units was undertaken. Rock mass failure criteria that utilise outputs from existing rock mass classification systems to determine the rock mass strength, have been reviewed. Utilising published triaxial data the rock mass failure criterion that best predicts the failure characteristics of UK Coal Measure strata was identified. From this study the Hoek-Brown rock mass failure criterion was identified as the optimum existing criterion for predicting the <b>intact</b> <b>strength</b> and rock mass strength of Coal Measure strata. However this criterion was still found not to produce a close fit in many cases to the intact failure strength of the strata. A modified Coal Measure Failure criterion has been developed, which {{for a wide range of}} Coal Measure rock types was found to produce a better prediction of the <b>intact</b> <b>strength</b> of Coal Measure strata than any of the existing rock mass failure criteria. To determine the efficacy of the Coal Mine Classification system as a means of predicting the strength and stiffness properties of the rock mass the Coal Mine Classification was applied to the strata at case study localities within rock bolted roadways within three UK mine sites. Numerical models of the case study localities were developed using the FLAC finite difference code utilising a ubiquitous jointed elastic-perfectly plastic material model to simulate strata behaviour. The output from the modelling included predicted roof and rib side displacements, and these displacements were compared to the actual monitoring data for the case study localities. The results of the numerical modelling indicate that the predictions produced by the numerical models reflected the pattern and scale of deformations actually measured in-situ within the coal mine roadways, thus indicating that the Coal Mine Classification system provides a means of predictively determining the engineering properties of the in-situ Coal Measure strata. The modelling also indicated that time delays related to the installation of the roof extensometers may under predict that actual roof deformation that occurs within the roadway roof...|$|E
40|$|Excitability and {{conductivity}} of corticospinal {{tracts of}} 10 volunteers were investigated by motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) to transcranial magnetic brain stimulation, {{before and after}} anesthetic block of right median (sensory + motor) and radial (sensory) nervous fibers at the wrist. MEPs were simultaneously recorded from two ulnar-supplied muscles during full relaxation and voluntary contraction. These muscles maintained an <b>intact</b> <b>strength</b> following anesthesia, but {{they were in a}} remarkably different condition with respect to the surrounding skin: the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) was totally 'enveloped' within the anesthetized area but was still dispatching a normal proprioceptive feedback; the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) was preserving both cutaneous and proprioceptive information. Spinal and peripheral nerve excitability were monitored as well. The sensory deprivation induced short-term changes which selectively took place within the hemisphere connected to the anesthetized hand. The physiological latency 'anticipation' of MEPs recorded during active contraction versus relaxation was reduced (P < 0. 001) in the FDI, but not in the ADM, when values during anesthesia were compared with preanesthesia values. The FDI cortical representation-as analyzed by a mapping procedure of the motor cortex via focal stimuli of several scalp positions-was significantly (P < 0. 002) reduced, while the ADM representation remained either unchanged or enlarged. MEP and F-wave variability significantly decreased in the FDI but not in the ADM. F-waves were also affected due to changes in the motoneuronal excitability at spinal level. Peripheral nerve and root stimulation showed no modifications. Results are discussed in view of the short-term modifications of the corticospinal pathway somatotopy produced by the selective reduction of the sensory flow. Implications of the sensory feedback in motor control are also discussed...|$|E
30|$|We {{use this}} method to characterise the URG granite {{encountered}} in EPS- 1 at Soultz-sous-Forêts {{and show that}} there are many intervals where using <b>intact</b> rock <b>strength</b> and stiffness parameters is appropriate given the low fracture density (for example, for a typical wellbore, <[*] 5  fractures/m). In these intervals our laboratory strengths can be used along with previous strength and stiffness data for reservoir and wellbore stability analysis. Numerical models of geothermal reservoirs or wellbores that use strength and stiffness should consider the lower values for these parameters in intensely fractured zones. A better understanding of the impact of fractures on rock mass strength and stiffness will lead to better defined model results for assessing reservoir deformation during exploitation and stimulation, and for determining appropriate drilling programmes for reservoir development, for example mud weight selection during drilling.|$|R
30|$|At the {{wellbore}} scale (for the GPK wells this is ~[*] 30  cm at our {{depth interval}} of interest) <b>intact</b> rock <b>strengths</b> and elastic moduli {{should only be}} used for intervals with fewer than 5  fractures/m, and rock mass strengths and elastic modulus {{should be used for}} intervals with greater than 10 fractures/m. These fracture density thresholds will vary depending on the diameter of the well. Rock masses with fracture densities that fall between these should be analysed using discrete methods, such as fracture/fault slip models (e.g. Evans 2005) or using discontinuum numerical modelling methods commonly used at the tunnel scale (e.g. Vardakos et al. 2007; Fekete and Diederichs 2013). Similarly, a fracture density consisting of only parallel joints, rather than intersecting joint sets, should be analysed using discrete methods because of the anisotropic nature of the rock mass.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{understanding}} {{of the relationship between the}} geological environment and rock mass behaviour induced by mining activities can lead to hazard reduction through knowledge-based design. However, characterisation of complex and heterogeneous rock masses that typify mining environments is difficult. A methodology to characterise these types of rock masses, based largely on classical statistics, geostatistics and an extension of previous quantitative structural domaining work, is presented and applied to the Kiirunavaara Mine, Sweden. In addition to a new perspective on <b>intact</b> rock <b>strengths</b> of geological units at the mine, a correlation was found between modelled volumes of clay, modelled RQD, newly identified structural domains and falls of ground. These relationships enabled development of a conceptual model of the role of geology in rock mass behaviour at the mine. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be useful in characterisation of complex rock masses...|$|R
