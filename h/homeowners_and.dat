5|$|The casino {{legislation}} was not called {{to a vote}} in the Democratic controlled Kentucky House of Representatives, where 60 votes out of 100 would have been required for passage. Beshear announced that his proposal for a constitutional amendment to allow for casinos was dead for the regular session on March 27, 2008. Among the other proposals favored by Beshear that failed to pass in the session were an ethics reform measure Beshear proposed {{in the wake of the}} investigation of the Fletcher administration, a plan to reduce the projected shortfall in the state's pension system, and a proposed 70-cent-per-pack tax increase on cigarettes. Besides the state budget, major legislation passed during the session included incentives for <b>homeowners</b> <b>and</b> businesses to utilize energy efficiency measures, anti-bullying legislation, and increased penalties for animal cruelty.|$|E
5|$|In net {{metering}} {{the price of}} the electricity produced {{is the same as the}} price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard electricity meters, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows <b>homeowners</b> <b>and</b> businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With {{net metering}}, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate {{program is}} {{provided}} for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; {{and people with}} disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both <b>homeowners</b> <b>and</b> renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially greater than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.|$|E
25|$|One {{explanation}} is that older Californians with fixed incomes had increasing difficulty paying property taxes, which were rising {{as a result of}} California's population growth, increasing housing demand, and inflation. Due to severe inflation during the 1970s, reassessments of residential property increased property taxes so much, that some retired people could no longer afford to remain in homes they had purchased long before. An academic study found support for this explanation, reporting that older voters, <b>homeowners,</b> <b>and</b> voters expecting a tax increase were more likely to vote for Proposition 13.|$|E

25|$|Only a city-wide ban in December 1939 on burning low-quality Illinois coal made a {{significant}} change in the pollution, forcing <b>homeowners</b> <b>and</b> businesses alike to switch to cleaner-burning Arkansas coal. The result of the ban was significant: during the winter of 1939-40, St. Louis experienced 177 hours of thick smoke pollution, while in the winter of 1940-1941, only 17 hours of thick smoke was reported. In addition, the Laclede Gas Company began to supply cleaner-burning natural gas to customers starting in 1941, which largely rectified the problem of smoke pollution by the late 1940s.|$|E
25|$|The {{first piece}} of {{legislation}} Rendell initiated was The Plan for a New Pennsylvania. The Plan proposed using slot machine revenue to reduce taxes by $1.5 billion (an average 30% decrease for <b>homeowners)</b> <b>and</b> included $687 million in increased education funding. The plan was {{to be paid for}} with a proposed income tax increase from 2.80% to 3.75% plus increased taxes on utilities and beer. The governor's plan passed but with a smaller tax increase to only 3.07% and increased education funding of $450 million. The final budget deal included additional taxes on cigarettes and utilities.|$|E
25|$|Until 1916, mail {{carriers}} {{knocked on}} the door and waited patiently for someone to answer. Efficiency experts estimated that each mailman lost over 1.5 hours each day just waiting for patrons to come to the door. To correct this problem, the Post Office Department ordered that every household must have a mail box or letter slot in order to receive mail. This requirement was phased in, starting with new delivery locations, around 1912. Slowly, <b>homeowners</b> <b>and</b> businesses began to install mail slots or attached mailboxes to receive mail when they were either not at home or unable to answer the door. The requirement was made mandatory in 1923.|$|E

25|$|When on the ground, {{the team}} {{found that many}} {{residents}} had not flushed their plumbing systems despite being given permission days before their arrival. Contaminated water remained in homeowner plumbing systems, leaving it to contact plumbing materials such as pipes, valves, gaskets, and joints. Homeowners they spoke with explained that they had refused to flush because of reports they heard from friends that odors caused by flushing could cause negative health impacts. Many homeowners stated no intention of flushing for the foreseeable future. In response, the research team modified the flushing protocol that was issued to <b>homeowners</b> <b>and</b> helped flush residences with these more health protective measures.|$|E
25|$|If a water {{absorbing}} swale {{for each}} yard {{is combined with}} permeable concrete streets, storm drains can be omitted from the neighbourhood. This can save more than $800 per house (1970s) by eliminating storm drains. One way to use the savings is to purchase larger lots, which permits more amenities at the same cost. Permeable concrete is an established product in warm climates, and in development for freezing climates. In freezing climates, the elimination of storm drains can often still pay for enough land to construct swales (shallow water collecting ditches) or water impeding berms instead. This plan provides more land for <b>homeowners</b> <b>and</b> can offer more interesting topography for landscaping.|$|E
25|$|Ontario, Canada's {{most populous}} province, generates some 9,600 MW annually, {{over half of}} that coming from one dozen nuclear reactors. Ontario also has natural gas, and hydro facilities. However, Ontario faces a {{challenge}} as it must replace 80% of its generating capacity in the next twenty years—the old stations have time-expired and the nuclear reactors are overstressed. A debate continues over whether to go largely nuclear or go with renewables. Since the Green Energy Act 2009, the debate has become even more heated. As one of the outcomes of the Act, electricity prices have exponentially - by 95% for <b>homeowners</b> <b>and</b> by 115% for small businesses {{in the province of}} Ontario.|$|E

25|$|On February 9, 2012, it was {{announced}} that the five largest mortgage servicers (Ally Financial, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) agreed to a settlement with the federal government and 49 states. The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed <b>homeowners</b> <b>and</b> in direct payments to the states and federal government. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. The five banks were also required to comply with 305 new mortgage servicing standards. Oklahoma held out and agreed to settle with the banks separately.|$|E
25|$|Framingham {{is one of}} the few {{towns in}} Massachusetts that have met their legal {{requirement}} of 10% for Massachusetts Chapter 40B Affordable housing which mostly targets people with income levels in the 70% of median income. In addition to its 40B Affordable component, Framingham has a large percentage of rental units which target people in the 30% of median income bracket. Framingham has a much larger percentage of rental households than any of the surrounding towns. Statewide, the median income of rental households is 47% of the median for <b>homeowners,</b> <b>and</b> in Middlesex County it is slightly more than 50%. In Framingham, the median renter income of $33,626 is 45% of the median homeowner income of $75,040.|$|E
25|$|The Jacksonville Housing Authority (JHA) is the quasi-independent agency {{responsible}} for public housing and subsidized housing in Jacksonville. The Mayor and City Council of Jacksonville established the JHA in 1994 to create an effective, community service oriented, public housing agency with innovative ideas and a different attitude. The primary goal was to provide safe, clean, affordable housing for eligible low and moderate income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. The secondary goal was to provide effective social services, work with residents to improve their quality of life, encourage employment and self-sufficiency, and help residents move out of assisted housing. To that end, JHA works with HabiJax to help low and moderate income families to escape the public housing cycle and become successful, productive, <b>homeowners</b> <b>and</b> taxpayers.|$|E
