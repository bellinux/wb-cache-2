40|$|We {{investigated}} plasma hormone {{profiles of}} corticosterone in <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> (Chelonia mydas) {{in response to}} a capture stress protocol. Further, we examined whether age class and sex were covariates associated with variation in both basal corticosterone levels and the adrenocortical stress response of non-breeding <b>green</b> <b>turtles.</b> <b>Green</b> <b>turtles</b> responded to the capture stress protocol by significantly increasing plasma levels of corticosterone over an eight-hour period. Further, there was a significant effect of age class on the capacity for <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> to produce corticosterone {{in response to a}} capture stressor, with juvenile <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> having higher basal levels of corticosterone and producing significantly more corticosterone in response to capture stress than non-breeding adult turtles. In contrast there was no significant sex difference in the corticosterone stress response of <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> irrespective of age class. In summary, <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> exhibited an adrenocortical response to a capture stress protocol. This response was significantly associated with different age classes, perhaps suggesting that the response is increased in juvenile turtles to offset the reduced probability of survival consistent with this more vulnerable age class...|$|R

40|$|In nature, <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> (Chelonia mydas) can exhibit nocturnal {{activity}} {{in addition to}} their typically diurnal activity cycle. We examined whether nocturnal {{activity in}} captive and free-living <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> altered daily plasma profiles of melatonin (MEL) and corticosterone (CORT). In captivity, diurnally active <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> expressed distinct diel cycles in MEL and CORT; a nocturnal rise was observed in MEL and a diurnal rise was observed in CORT. However, when induced to perform both low- and high-intensity nocturnal activity, captive <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> exhibited a significant decrease in MEL, compared to inactive controls. In contrast, plasma CORT increased significantly with nocturnal activity, and further, the relative increase in CORT was correlated with the intensity of the nocturnal behavior. In free-living <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> that performed nocturnal activity including: nesting, mate searching, and feeding/swimming behaviors, plasma profiles in MEL and CORT exhibited relatively little, or no, daily fluctuation. Our findings demonstrate that nocturnal activity in <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> is often associated with MEL and CORT profiles that resemble those measured during the day. We speculate that these conspicuous changes in MEL and CORT during nocturnal activity could either support or promote behaviors that enable acquisition of transient resources important to the survival and reproductive success of <b>green</b> <b>turtles.</b> (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA) ...|$|R
40|$|Located 100 km west of Key West, Florida, Dry Tortugas National Park (DRTO) is {{a largely}} {{untouched}} subtropical marine ecosystem {{that serves as}} an important developmental habitat, nesting ground, and foraging area for several species of sea <b>turtles,</b> including <b>green</b> <b>turtles.</b> The Park supports a recovering population of <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> comprised of resident juveniles, subadults, and adults of both sexes; nesting females include residents and migrating females that only return to nest. Stable isotope analysis has been applied widely to describe the trophic ecology of <b>green</b> <b>turtles,</b> from urbanized bays with significant anthropogenic input, to relatively pristine ecosystems with healthy populations at carrying capacity. However, there is a paucity of published literature about the trophic ecology of <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> in DRTO.

40|$|Lung-eye-trachea disease-associated {{herpesvirus}} (LETV) {{is linked}} with {{morbidity and mortality}} in mariculture-reared <b>green</b> <b>turtles,</b> but its prevalence among and impact on wild marine turtle populations is unknown. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for detection of anti-LETV antibodies and could distinguish LETV-exposed <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> from those with antibodies to fibropapillomatosis-associated herpesvirus (FPHV). Plasma from two captive-reared <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> immunized with inactivated LETV served as positive controls. Plasma from 42 healthy captive-reared <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> and plasma from 30 captive-reared <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> with experimentally induced fibropapillomatosis (FP) and anti-FPHV antibodies had low ELISA values on LETV antigen. A survey of 19 wild <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> with and 27 without FP (with and without anti-FPHV antibodies, respectively) identified individuals with antibodies to LETV regardless of their FP status. The seroprevalence of LETV infection was 13 %. The presence of antibodies to LETV in plasma samples was confirmed by Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. These results {{are the first to}} suggest that wild Florida <b>green</b> <b>turtles</b> are exposed to LETV or to an antigenically closely related herpesvirus(es) other than FPHV and that FPHV and LETV infections are most likely independent events. This is the first ELISA developed to detect antibodies for a specific herpesvirus infection of marine turtles. The specificity of this ELISA for LETV (ability to distinguish LETV from FPHV) makes it valuable for detecting exposure to this specific herpesvirus and enhances our ability to conduct seroepidemiological studies of these disease-associated agents in marine turtles...|$|R

25|$|Anatomically, a few {{characteristics}} {{distinguish the}} <b>green</b> <b>turtle</b> {{from the other}} members of its family. Unlike the closely related hawksbill turtle, the green turtle's snout is very short and its beak is unhooked. The neck cannot be pulled into the shell. The sheath of the turtle's upper jaw possesses a denticulated edge, while its lower jaw has stronger, serrated, more defined denticulation. The dorsal surface of the turtle's head has a single pair of prefrontal scales. Its carapace is composed of five central scutes flanked by four pairs of lateral scutes. Underneath, the <b>green</b> <b>turtle</b> has four pairs of inframarginal scutes covering the area between the turtle's plastron and its shell. Mature C. mydas front appendages have only a single claw (as opposed to the hawksbill's two), although a second claw is sometimes prominent in young specimens.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} mammals have been introduced: donkeys, sheep, cats and rats among others. Reptiles consist of {{two species of}} lizards. Endemic insect species include the minute, {{wingless}} Psocopteran Troglotroctes ashmolearum, that {{has been found in}} caves and between lava blocks. In summer, flies are known to be a problem.The largest native land animal is the land crab Johngarthia lagostoma (formerly Gecarcinus lagostoma). Offshore, there is a variety of open-ocean fish, including sharks, wahoo, tuna, bonito, barracuda, marlin, blackfish and sailfish. The protected <b>green</b> <b>turtle</b> is perhaps the most notable of the endemic fauna, coming ashore to lay their eggs on the beaches from November to May. Turtles were regularly harvested until 1930, when the practice was banned. By 1970 the turtle population had begun to rebound.
