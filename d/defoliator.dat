5|$|In about 1840, L. decemlineata {{adopted the}} {{cultivated}} potato into its host range and it rapidly became a most destructive pest of potato crops. They are today {{considered to be}} the most important insect <b>defoliator</b> of potatoes. They may also cause significant damage to tomato and eggplant crops with both adults and larvae feeding on the plant's foliage. Larvae may defoliate potato plants resulting in yield losses of up to 100% if the damage occurs prior to tuber formation. Larvae may consume 40cm2 of potato leaves during the entire larval stage, but adults are capable of consuming 10cm2 of foliage per day.|$|E

40|$|Some minor <b>defoliators</b> {{have been}} noted in soybean this growing season, {{including}} caterpillars, beetles, and grasshoppers. Specifically, soybean <b>defoliators</b> observed include green cloverworm, soybean looper, alfalfa caterpillar, imported longhorn weevil, Japanese beetle, and Iowa colaspis beetle. It {{is important to remember}} that soybean can tolerate as much as 40 % defoliation during vegetative growth stages, and 20 % during pod-forming and pod-fillings stages before yield loss occurs. If defoliation is observed during scouting, it is important to identify the insect or combination of insects...|$|R
40|$|Field {{trials were}} {{laid in the}} farmer’s {{holdings}} at Kaalipalayam, Coimbatore district during August, 2011 to November, 2011 to assess the efficacy of selected botanical insecticides against aphids, thrips, leaf miners and <b>defoliators</b> infesting Solanum nigrum. The results of the experiments revealed that among the treatments, foliar spray of profenophos {{is found to be}} the best treatment for the management of sucking pests viz., aphids and thrips as well as <b>defoliators</b> viz., leaf miner and other <b>defoliators</b> and also recorded maximum leaf yield. Among the botanicals, 1 % azadirachtin and 2 % aqueous extract of Andrographis paniculata recorded maximum reduction in pest population and also conserved more number of natural enemies like predatory coccinellids.

40|$|The {{study of}} soil fauna {{was carried out}} in the spring of 2002, in 11 oak forests, placed in the basin of Siret river infested, by <b>defoliators</b> (Tortrix viri-dana, Geometridae, Apethymus filiformis, Noctuidae). The {{biological}} materi-al (78310 specimens) collected from 31 Barber trap batteries (12 traps/battery with concentrated salt solution) was classified from systematical and food re-gimen point of view. Structure and abundance of soil fauna depends on site and stand charac-teristics, level of infestation with <b>defoliators</b> and influence of anthropic factor (pollution, chemical treatments). A special role in maintaining the biocenotical balance is played by preda-tor soil fauna. The most important groups of predators from the studied forests are coleopters from the families Carabidae and Staphylinidae and spiders and mites from orders Aranea and Acarina (genus Eutrombidium). Carabidae species with a special impact on oak <b>defoliators</b> are Abax ater, A. ovalis, Carabus coriaceus, C. excelens, C. violaceus, Harpalus pubescens, H. griseus, H. calceatus, Calosoma inquisitor, Molops piceus, Pterostichus sp., Notiophilus sp [...] The predator soil fauna reacts obviously at direct and indirect action of stress factors like chemical treatments, which diminish the available food...|$|R
