2500|$|As sub-routines {{functions}} can {{be integrated}} and used {{in a variety of}} ways, and {{in a wide variety of}} larger, more complicated applications. [...] Within large <b>enterprise</b> <b>applications</b> they may, for example, play an important role in defining business rules or risk management parameters, while remaining virtually undetected by end users. [...] Within database management systems and spreadsheets, however, these kinds of functions also represent discrete sets of tools; they can be accessed directly and utilized on a stand-alone basis, or in more complex, user-defined configurations. In this context, functions can be used for business intelligence and ad hoc analysis of data in fields such as finance, statistics, engineering, math, etc.|$|E
2500|$|The Zisapel {{brothers}} had expanded their focus beyond miniature modems. While RAD {{would go on}} to release its first fiber optic product in 1986 and its first multiplexer one year later, the Zisapels were developing new ideas for communications products for <b>enterprise</b> <b>applications</b> - [...] adapters for servers and security appliances; integrated network management solutions; video conferencing infrastructure and development tools; wireless devices, and other industry niches. [...] But rather than follow the traditional industry paradigm by having their one existing company branch out into new areas beyond its original mandate, the Zisapels decided to found a new company that would focus on each specific industry niche they targeted. This approach grew into the RAD Group, a family of independent companies that develop, manufacture and market solutions for diverse segments of the networking and telecommunications industries.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, JEDEC {{published}} the Wide I/O 2 standard; it stacks multiple memory dies, {{but does that}} directly {{on top of the}} CPU and in the same package. This memory layout provides higher bandwidth and better power performance than DDR4 SDRAM, and allows a wide interface with short signal lengths. It primarily aims to replace various mobile DDRX SDRAM standards used in high-performance embedded and mobile devices, such as smartphones. [...] Hynix proposed similar High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), which was published as JEDEC JESD235. [...] Both Wide I/O 2 and HBM use a very wide parallel memory interface, up to 512 bits wide for Wide I/O 2 (compared to 64 bits for DDR4), running at a lower frequency than DDR4. Wide I/O 2 is targeted at high-performance compact devices such as smartphones, where it will be integrated into the processor or system on a chip (SoC) packages. HBM is targeted at graphics memory and general computing, while HMC targets high-end servers and <b>enterprise</b> <b>applications.</b>|$|E
