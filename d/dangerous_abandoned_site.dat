40|$|Commercial and {{centralized}} drilling-fluid disposal (CCDD) sites {{receive a}} portion of spent drilling fluids for disposal from {{oil and gas exploration}} and production (E&P) operations. Many older and some <b>abandoned</b> <b>sites</b> may have operated under less stringent regulations than are currently enforced. This study provides a census, compilation, and summary of information on active, inactive, and <b>abandoned</b> CCDD <b>sites</b> in Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, intended as a basis for supporting State-funded assessment and remediation of <b>abandoned</b> <b>sites.</b> Closure of <b>abandoned</b> CCDD <b>sites</b> is within the jurisdiction of State regulatory agencies. Sources of data used in this study on <b>abandoned</b> CCDD <b>sites</b> mainly are permit files at State regulatory agencies. Active and inactive sites were included because data on <b>abandoned</b> <b>sites</b> are sparse. Onsite reserve pits at individual wells for disposal of spent drilling fluid are not part of this study. Of 287 CCDD sites in the four States for which we compiled data, 34 had been abandoned whereas 54 were active and 199 were inactive as of January 2002. Most were disposal-pit facilities; five percent were land treatment facilities. A typical disposal-pit facility has fewer than 3 disposal pits or cells, which have a median size of approximately 2 acres each. Data from well-documented sites may be used to predict some conditions at abandoned sites; older <b>abandoned</b> <b>sites</b> might have outlier concentrations for some metal and organic constituents. Groundwater at a significant number of sites had an average chloride concentration that exceeded nonactionable secondary drinking water standard of 250 mg/L, or a total dissolved solids content of > 10, 000 mg/L, the limiting definition for underground sources of drinking water source, or both. Background data were lacking, however, so we did not determine whether these concentrations in groundwater reflected site operations. Site remediation has not been found necessary to date for most <b>abandoned</b> CCDD sites; <b>site</b> assessments and remedial feasibility studies are ongoing in each State. Remediation alternatives addressed physical hazards and potential for groundwater transport of dissolved salt and petroleum hydrocarbons that might be leached from wastes. Remediation options included excavation of wastes and contaminated adjacent soils followed by removal to permitted disposal facilities or land farming if sufficient on-site area were available...|$|R

40|$|Sedimentation and {{sediment}} metabolism was measured at eight active milkfish fish pens {{and at one}} <b>abandoned</b> <b>site</b> in the Bolinao area, Philippines {{in order to examine}} the interactions between sediment and water in this shallow coastal zone. The rates of sedimentation were high in the area due to siltation, but the activities in the fish pens also contributed to enhanced sedimentation as indicated by the difference between the <b>abandoned</b> and active <b>sites.</b> The sediment metabolism appeared to decrease with increasing rates of sedimentation indicating that the microbial activity reached a saturation level in the fish pen sediments. Anaerobic processes dominated the organic matter decomposition, and sulfate reduction rates are among the highest measured in fish farm sediments. The rates decreased with increasing organic loading despite high concentrations of sulfate (> 10 mM) at all sites. Presence of methane bubbles in the sediments suggests that sulfate reduction and methanogenesis were coexisting. The sediment metabolism was significantly reduced at the <b>abandoned</b> <b>site</b> indicating that the stimulation of microbial activities is due to active fish production. The anaerobic activity remained high at the <b>abandoned</b> <b>site</b> indicating that the sediment biogeochemical conditions remain affected long time after fish production has ceased. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Urban explorers {{have for}} some time been {{producing}} informal iconographic and textual records of manmade structures which because of being abandoned or inaccessible for the general public, are not usually {{in the public eye}} and are often in a state of deterioration and in danger of being destroyed. This interdisciplinary research which connects the fields of architecture, history, conservation, and digital humanities, looks into the materials recorded by the urban exploration (urbex) community and investigates their potential for the protection and documentation of decaying or demolished <b>abandoned</b> architectural heritage <b>sites.</b> For the management and dissemination of heritage information for the <b>abandoned</b> <b>sites,</b> more specifically, the recently demolished Château de Noisy, a famous urbex destination in Belgium, this study explores and builds upon the existing digital resources and looks into various tools and techniques to compile, curate and present this data to narrate the story of <b>abandoned</b> heritage <b>sites.</b> Additionally, through visualisation of data collected, cleaned, and compiled using the Flickr application programming interface (Flickr API) and Python, the changes in the urbex community’s activity since their debut on Flickr are observed. This research shows the value of the existing urbex digital data for documentation and potential conservation of <b>abandoned</b> heritage <b>sites</b> and demonstrates how a mindful digital narration of even a demolished heritage site can create an engaging and immersive experience which records and preserves the heritage and its story. Additionally, it can raise public awareness which in the case of deteriorating <b>abandoned</b> <b>sites</b> can lead to their potential revival...|$|R
