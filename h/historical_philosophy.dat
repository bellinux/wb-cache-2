60|$|If France {{had been}} prosperous, all {{this would have}} passed for the empty declamation of an excited man of letters. As it was, such declamation only described, in {{language}} as accurate as it was violent and stinging, the real position of the country. In the urgency of a present material distress, men were not over-careful that {{the basis of the}} indictment should be laid in the principles of a sound <b>historical</b> <b>philosophy</b> of society. We can hardly wonder at it. What is interesting, and what we do not notice earlier in the century, is that in the System of Nature the revolt against the impotence of society, and the revolt against the omnipotence of God, made a firm coalition. That coalition came to a bloody end for the time, four-and-twenty years after Holbach's book proclaimed it, when the Committee of Public Safety despatched Hébert, and better men than Hébert, to the guillotine for being atheists. Atheism, as Robespierre assured them, was aristocratic.|$|E

60|$|There {{is no need}} here {{to enter}} into any {{criticism}} of Montesquieu's great work, how far the merits of its execution equalled the merit of its design, how far his vicious confusion of the senses of the word 'law' impaired the worth of his book, as a contribution to inductive or comparative history. We have only to seek {{the difference between the}} philosophic conception of Montesquieu and the philosophic conception of Turgot. The latter may be considered a more liberal completion of the former. Turgot not only sees the operation of law in the movements and institutions of society, but he interprets this law in a positive and scientific sense, as an ascertainable succession of social states, each of them being the cause and effect of other social states. Turgot gives its deserved prominence to the fertile idea of there being an ordered movement of growth or advance among societies; in other words, of the civilisation of any given portion of mankind having fixed conditions analogous to those of a physical organism. Finally, he does not limit his thought by fixing it upon the laws and constitutions only of countries, but refers <b>historical</b> <b>philosophy</b> to its veritable and widest object and concern, the steps and conditions of the progression of the human mind.|$|E
6000|$|Among {{the minor}} crimes of England may be classed the shallow {{criticism}} and easy abandonment of Napoleon III. The Victorian English {{had a very}} bad habit of being influenced by words {{and at the same}} time pretending to despise them. They would build their whole <b>historical</b> <b>philosophy</b> upon two or three titles, and then refuse to get even the titles right. The solid Victorian Englishman, with his whiskers and his Parliamentary vote, was quite content to say that Louis Napoleon and William of Prussia both became Emperors--by which he meant autocrats. His whiskers would have bristled with rage and he would have stormed at you for hair-splitting and [...] "lingo," [...] if you had answered that William was German Emperor, while Napoleon was not French Emperor, but only Emperor of the French. What could such mere order of the words matter? Yet the same Victorian would have been even more indignant if he had been asked to be satisfied with an Art Master, when he had advertised for a Master of Arts. His irritation would have increased if the Art Master had promised him a sea-piece and had brought him a piece of the sea; or if, during the decoration of his house, the same aesthetic humourist had undertaken to procure some Indian Red and had produced a Red Indian.|$|E
6000|$|His {{great and}} real work was {{the attack on}} Utilitarianism: which did real good, though there was much that was muddled and {{dangerous}} in the <b>historical</b> <b>philosophy</b> which he preached as an alternative. It is his real glory {{that he was the}} first to see clearly and say plainly the great truth of our time; that the wealth of the state is not the prosperity of the people. Macaulay and the Mills and all the regular run of the Early Victorians, took it for granted that if Manchester was getting richer, we had got hold of the key to comfort and progress. Carlyle pointed out (with stronger sagacity and humour than he showed on any other question) that it was just as true to say that Manchester was getting poorer as that it was getting richer: or, in other words, that Manchester was not getting richer at all, but only some of the less pleasing people in Manchester. In this matter he is to be noted in connection with national developments much later; for he thus became the first prophet of the Socialists. Sartor Resartus is an admirable fantasia; The French Revolution is, with all its faults, a really fine piece of history; the lectures on Heroes contain some masterly sketches of personalities. But I think it is in Past and Present, and the essay on Chartism, that Carlyle achieves the work he was chosen by gods and men to achieve; which possibly might not have been achieved by a happier or more healthy-minded man. He never rose to more deadly irony than in such macabre descriptions as that of the poor woman proving her sisterhood with the rich by giving them all typhoid fever; or that perfect piece of badinage about [...] "Overproduction of Shirts"; in which he imagines the aristocrats claiming to be quite clear of this offence. [...] "Will you bandy accusations, will you accuse us of overproduction? We take the Heavens and the Earth to witness that we have produced nothing at all.... He that accuses us of producing, let him show himself. Let him say what and when." [...] And he never wrote so sternly and justly as when he compared the [...] "divine sorrow" [...] of Dante with the [...] "undivine sorrow" [...] of Utilitarianism, which had already come down to talking about the breeding of the poor and to hinting at infanticide. This is a representative quarrel; for if the Utilitarian spirit reached its highest point in Mill, it certainly reached its lowest point in Malthus.|$|E

5000|$|In {{continental}} philosophy, {{language is}} not studied as a separate discipline, {{as it is in}} analytic philosophy. Rather, it is an inextricable part of many other areas of thought, such as phenomenology, semiotics, hermeneutics, Heideggerean ontology, existentialism, structuralism, deconstruction and critical theory. The idea of language is often related to that of logic in its Greek sense as [...] "Logos", meaning discourse or dialectic. Language and concepts are also seen as having been formed by history and politics, or even by <b>historical</b> <b>philosophy</b> itself.|$|E
5000|$|Gudmundsson (2007, p. 38) writes: [...] "Source {{criticism}} {{should not}} totally dominate later courses.

This quote makes {{a distinction between}} source criticism {{on the one hand}} and <b>historical</b> <b>philosophy</b> on the other hand. However, different views of history and different specific theories about the field being studied may have important consequences for how sources are selected, interpreted and used. Feminist scholars may, for example, select sources made by women and may interpret sources from a feminist perspective. Epistemology should thus be considered a part of source criticism. It is in particular related to [...] "tendency analysis".|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{conceptual}} paper was to propose an ultimate goal and purpose for the field and practice of adult education. A literature search was conducted to delineate <b>historical</b> <b>philosophies</b> of education that inform {{the current state of}} education, including adult education. Furthermore, building upon the rudiments of adult education extant an end goal for the field is presented. The conceptual proposal emphasizes the critical need for the pursuit of foundational truths in the human experience. This is akin to notions of Essentialism and Perennialism. This paper contends that adult education can significantly assist humanity by duly preparing adults to more effectively, efficaciously, realistically, and wisely interface the epochal markers in earthly existence. Thus, in order to commence such a litany of admirable traits in adulthood, it is proposed that adult education must involve itself in the business of acquiring and propagating information that leads to, integrates with, and logically yields that which is right, virtuous and timelessly true...|$|R

50|$|By {{the late}} 22nd century, the Psychotechnic Institute becomes {{a victim of}} its own success. An {{automated}} economy has created massive unemployment, which gives rise to an antitechnology movement called Humanism (a term having {{little to do with}} the <b>historical</b> <b>philosophy</b> of Humanism, and is indeed in many ways antithetical to it). Around 2170 the Humanists seize control of Earth, withdraw from the Solar Union, and abolish the Psychotechnic Institute. The Humanist regime quickly grows unpopular, and is overthrown by a popular uprising aided by Mars and Venus. However, the Psychotechnic Institute is not revived, and in its absence technic civilization begins a slow and steady descent into extremism which results in a new dark age starting in the 24th century.|$|E
5000|$|At first, speech, {{traditional}} and folk media, and group activities were {{considered the most}} appropriate instruments for supporting participatory communication hence, the practitioners {{in the mass media}} responded by innovating their own approach towards participatory communication (Yoon, 1996) which brought the emergence of community radios. The <b>historical</b> <b>philosophy</b> of community radio is to use this medium as the voice of the voiceless, the mouthpiece of the oppressed people and generally as a tool for development. Yoon (1996) articulates that in community radios, the people [...] "produced and voiced the programs which were focused on local issues which were the most current and important making way for participatory communication to be practiced at both the community or village level and at the broader regional or sub-regional level". Most of the successes of community broadcasting {{are to be found in}} the non-formal education sector (Beltran,1993 in Yoon, 1996). Literacy programs have been effectively conducted via community radio and television stations. Other subjects covered by these stations include gender issues, farming, health, income-generation, workers' safety and occupational health, land tenure, and religious matters (Yoon, 1996).|$|E
5000|$|Pekař was a {{conservative}} patriot, rejecting almost mythological deification of some historical events, which {{in his opinion}} had rather negative consequencies (Hussite wars, etc.). He was convinced about substantial negative impact of religious conflicts on Czech history and many times urged Czech patriotism {{to get rid of}} them. He was a strong opponent of <b>historical</b> <b>philosophy</b> of František Palacký and T.G.Masaryk. As a historian, he reproached Masaryk for putting too much emphasis on the religious reformist significance of Czech history, while he himself stressed the aspect of nationality. In the beginning, he considered national element as fundamental and motive, later, he spoke about complex concept of Czech history, putting it inside wider European context, being aware of complicacy and relativity of historical events. He respected the rights of the German population living within Czech territory, but he strongly opposed an historical interpretation of Czech-German relations from a [...] "Greater German" [...] perspective. He also appreciated the role of foreign, western European factors in Czech history. In his view, the history of a nation cannot emerge from a single foundation, as Masaryk claimed, but is formed out of the countless layers produced by cultural, economic and political changes.|$|E
