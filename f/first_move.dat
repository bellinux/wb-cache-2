5|$|Allowing the enpassant capture, {{together}} {{with the introduction of}} the two-square <b>first</b> <b>move</b> for pawns, {{was one of the last}} major rule changes in European chess, and occurred between 1200 and 1600. Other relatively recent rule changes were castling, the unlimited range for queens and bishops (Spanish master Ruy López de Segura gives the rule in his 1561 book Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez) and a change to the rules on pawn promotion. In most places the en passant rule was adopted at the same time as allowing the pawn to move two squares on its <b>first</b> <b>move,</b> but it was not universally accepted until the Italian rules were changed in 1880.|$|E

The price of gold on the New York exchange fell to $130 per ounce – the lowest point since the suspension of specie payment in 1862.|$|E
5|$|The British {{commander-in-chief}} in North America, Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, had forbidden any offensive {{action on}} the Niagara Frontier. This left the local British forces with {{no alternative but to}} wait for the Americans to make the <b>first</b> <b>move</b> and try to counter any attempt at invasion. The regular troops were distributed among the defensive outposts and supplemented with militia and Native American forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{motivation}} for enpassant was {{to prevent the}} newly added two-square <b>first</b> <b>move</b> for pawns from allowing a pawn to evade capture by an enemy pawn.

5|$|After the 1962 season, the Yankees sold Turley to the Los Angeles Angels for cash, in the <b>first</b> <b>move</b> made by new Yankees' {{general manager}} Roy Hamey, {{who sought to}} rebuild the Yankees {{pitching}} staff. The move was conditional; the Angels could return Turley {{if they were not}} satisfied with him. The Angels chose to retain Turley {{at the start of the}} 1963 season. Turley struggled, winning two games while losing seven, and the Angels released him in July. A week later, he signed with the Boston Red Sox. Turley retired after the 1963 season, with a 101–85 win–loss record and a 3.64 ERA in 12 seasons.|$|E
5|$|Between 1200 and 1600 several laws {{emerged that}} {{drastically}} altered the game. Checkmate became a requirement to win; a player could not win by capturing {{all of the}} opponent's pieces. Stalemate was added, although the outcome has changed several times (see History of the stalemate rule). Pawns gained the option of moving two squares on their <b>first</b> <b>move,</b> and the en passant rule was a natural consequence of that new option. The king and rook acquired the right to castle (see Variations throughout history of castling for {{different versions of the}} rule).|$|E
5|$|Chess {{players and}} theoreticians have long debated whether, given perfect play by both sides, the game should {{end in a}} win for White, or a draw. Since {{approximately}} 1889, when World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz addressed this issue, the overwhelming consensus has been that a perfectly played game would end in a draw. However, a few notable players have argued that White's advantage may be sufficient to force a win: Weaver Adams and Vsevolod Rauzer claimed that White is winning after the <b>first</b> <b>move</b> 1.e4, while Hans Berliner argued that 1.d4 may win for White.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{sex differences in}} the likelihood of initiating <b>first</b> <b>moves</b> (toward relationship establishment) or first dates via short message service (SMS) text messaging and telephone calls. The sample comprised 159 females and 107 males, mean age 28 years, who completed an on-line self-report questionnaire that assessed relationship initiating behaviours. Whereas females {{were more likely to}} initiate <b>first</b> <b>moves</b> using SMS than telephone calls, males had no preference for communication channel. In initiating first dates, males were more likely to telephone than SMS, whereas females were reluctant to initiate regardless of the communication channel. Although males were more likely than females to initiate <b>first</b> <b>moves</b> and <b>first</b> dates via telephone calls, there were no sex differences when initiating via SMS. It was concluded that while SMS appears to have somewhat influenced the manner in which romantic <b>first</b> <b>moves</b> are initiated, traditional gender role expectations and preference for telephone communication are still strong when initiating first dates...|$|R

5|$|During Roosevelt's fifteen months {{beyond the}} Atlantic, from March 1909 to June 1910, neither man wrote {{much to the}} other. Taft biographer Lurie {{suggested}} that each expected the other to make the <b>first</b> <b>move</b> to re-establish their relationship on a new footing. Upon Roosevelt's triumphant return, Taft invited him {{to stay at the}} White House. The former president declined, and in private letters to friends expressed dissatisfaction at Taft's performance. Nevertheless, he wrote that he expected Taft to be renominated by the Republicans in 1912, and did not speak of himself as a candidate.|$|E
5|$|In 1646, the Parliamentary Colonels John Birch and Robert Kyrle marched {{south from}} their {{successful}} Siege of Hereford and besieged the castle, {{with the aim}} of eliminating {{one of the few remaining}} Royalist strongholds. There was some personal animosity between Lingen and Birch, and both were outspoken, impulsive men. Birch's <b>first</b> <b>move</b> was to prevent further attacks from Lingen, and on 9March he burned the weakly defended stables in a surprise night attack, driving away the Royalist horses and temporarily denying the Royalist forces' mobility. Birch was unable to press home his advantage however, and over the next few months Lingen succeeded in replacing some of his horses and resumed his attacks on Parliamentary forces.|$|E

5|$|In 1819, Mälzel {{took the}} Turk {{on a tour}} of the United Kingdom. There were several new {{developments}} in the act, such as allowing the opponent the <b>first</b> <b>move</b> and eliminating the king's bishop's pawn from the Turk's pieces. This pawn handicap created further interest in the Turk, and spawned a book by W. J. Hunneman chronicling the matches played with this handicap. Despite the handicap, the Turk (operated by Mouret at the time) ended up with forty-five victories, three losses, and two stalemates.|$|E

On 30 May they moved to Solomon's Pools, {{to the south of}} Bethlehem. On 14 June the regiment returned to the front line at Ain Ed Duk, two miles north of Jericho. There they established observation posts to monitor Turkish activity, remaining until they were relieved on 30 June.|$|E
5|$|The first-move {{advantage}} in chess is the inherent {{advantage of the}} player (White) who makes the <b>first</b> <b>move</b> in chess. Chess players and theorists generally agree that White begins the game with some advantage. Since 1851, compiled statistics support this view; White consistently wins slightly more often than Black, usually scoring between 52 and 56percent. White's winning percentage {{is about the same}} for tournament games between humans and games between computers. However, White's advantage is less significant in blitz games and games between novices.|$|E

5|$|A {{decision}} on which factions were to name {{chiefs of staff}} and military regional commanders was announced on 19 August 2003 as the <b>first</b> <b>move</b> in military reform, superimposed {{on top of the}} various groups of fighters, government and former rebels. Kabila was able to name the armed forces chief of staff, Lieutenant General Liwanga Mata, who previously served as navy chief of staff under Laurent Kabila. Kabila was able to name the air force commander (John Numbi), the RCD-Goma received the Land Force commander's position (Sylvain Buki) and the MLC the navy (Dieudonne Amuli Bahigwa). Three military regional commanders were nominated by the former Kinshasa government, two commanders each by the RCD-Goma and the MLC, and one region commander each by the RCD-K/ML and RCD-N. However these appointments were announced for Kabila's Forces armées congolaises (FAC), not the later FARDC. Another report however says that the military region commanders were only nominated in January 2004, and that the troop deployment on the ground did not change substantially until the year afterward.|$|E
5|$|A player {{capturing}} a piece immediately passes {{that piece}} to the capturing player's partner. The partner keeps these pieces in reserve and may, instead of playing a regular move, place {{one of these}} pieces on the board (as in shogi and crazyhouse), called dropping the piece. Pieces in reserve or on deck may be dropped on any vacant square, including squares where the piece delivers check or checkmate; however, pawns may not be dropped on the first or last rank. Dropped pawns may promote, but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion. A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its <b>first</b> <b>move.</b> Each player must keep the reserve or stock pieces {{on the table in}} front of the board, always visible to all players of the game.|$|E
5|$|According to plan, Kléber {{made the}} <b>first</b> <b>move,</b> {{advancing}} south from Düsseldorf against Württemberg's {{wing of the}} Army of the Lower Rhine. On 1 June 1796, a division of Kléber's troops led by François Joseph Lefebvre seized a bridge over the Sieg from Michael von Kienmayer's Austrians at Siegburg. Meanwhile, a second French division under Claude-Sylvestre Colaud menaced the Austrian left flank. Württemberg retreated south to Uckerath but then fell back farther to a well-fortified position at Altenkirchen. On 4 June, Kléber defeated Württemberg in the Battle of Altenkirchen, capturing 1,500 Austrian soldiers, 12 artillery pieces and four colors. Archduke Charles withdrew the Austrian forces from the Rhine's west bank and gave the Army of the Upper Rhine the principle responsibility to defend Mainz. After this setback, Charles replaced Württemberg with Wilhelm von Wartensleben, much to Württemberg's annoyance: the Duke returned to Vienna and offered the Aulic Council his persistent criticism of Charles' decisions and advise on how they could run the war better from the capital. Jourdan's main body crossed the Rhine on 10 June at Neuwied to join Kléber and the Army of Sambre and Meuse advanced to the Lahn River.|$|E
