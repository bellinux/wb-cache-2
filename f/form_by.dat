5|$|The {{outermost}} ring, Adams, contains five prominent arcs now named Courage, Liberté, Egalité1, Egalité2 and Fraternité (Courage, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity).

Astronomers now estimate that the arcs are corralled into their current <b>form</b> <b>by</b> the gravitational effects of Galatea, a moon just inward from the ring.|$|E
