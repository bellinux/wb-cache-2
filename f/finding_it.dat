5|$|Because of its name, Prosaurolophus {{is often}} {{associated}} with Saurolophus.

5|$|At the {{appointed}} hour, Duchess appears at Ribby's {{door and the}} party begins. Distracted for a moment, Duchess does not see which oven Ribby opens to remove the pie.

She sets up a howl; Ribby is perplexed and annoyed but leaves to find Dr. Maggoty, a magpie.|$|E
5|$|Benicio del Toro had {{significant}} input into {{certain parts of}} the film; for example, he suggested a simpler, more concise way of depicting his character kidnapping Francisco Flores that Soderbergh ended up using. The director cut a scene in which Robert Wakefield smokes crack after <b>finding</b> <b>it</b> in his daughter's bedroom. After rehearsing this scene with the actors, he felt that the character would not do it; after consulting with Gaghan, the screenwriter agreed and the filmmakers cut the scene shortly before it was scheduled to be shot.|$|E
5|$|Both {{teams were}} each given 12,000 tickets – the {{remaining}} 6,000 tickets were released, for purchase to the Swedish people. However, Stuttgart {{decided to send}} 11,000 of their 12,000 tickets back to UEFA, due to the German club's supporters <b>finding</b> <b>it</b> difficult {{to make their way}} to the country, as well as the absence of air flights available. Subsequently, none of the unsold tickets were granted for Chelsea and its followers; the consequences proved worse, when the side announced that they had issued tickets alone for those, who had ordered the more higher-priced package.|$|E

5|$|British mycologist Donald Dring, in his 1980 {{monograph}} on {{the family}} Clathraceae, wrote that C.ruber was not regarded highly in southern European folklore. He mentions a case of poisoning following its ingestion, reported by Barla in 1858, and notes that Ciro Pollini reported <b>finding</b> <b>it</b> growing on a human skull in a tomb in a deserted church. According to John Ramsbottom, Gascons consider the mushroom a cause of cancer; they will usually bury specimens they find. In other parts of France it has been reputed to produce skin rashes or cause convulsions.|$|E
5|$|By 1920 variety theatre {{had become}} popular in Britain, and Robey had {{completed}} the successful transition from music hall to variety star.

5|$|Despite being a French-language publication, the gazette {{was seen}} as {{independent}} of France. Its production was tolerated and even encouraged by the authorities, who often used Gazette de Leyde and other similar publications for their own ends, when wishing to publicize information {{that could not be}} released via the official channels. The paper also gave voice to institutions like the Parliament of France that were <b>finding</b> <b>it</b> difficult to publish in the official French newspaper, the Gazette de France.|$|E

5|$|For {{almost two}} decades after its discovery, Psilocybe tampanensis was known only from the type locality, {{southeast}} of Brandon, Florida. In 1996, Guzmán reported <b>finding</b> <b>it</b> in a meadow with sandy soil in a deciduous forest in Pearl River County, Mississippi, a habitat {{similar to that of}} the type location. Due to its scarcity, however, its habitat preferences are not known with certainty. Like all Psilocybe species, it is saprobic.|$|E

England played poorly against Sri Lanka, with Trescothick <b>finding</b> <b>it</b> hard to build a large innings.

5|$|In {{creating}} the game, Rohrer {{was influenced by}} his childhood fear of his house being robbed, numerous publicized shootings, and his own political views regarding gun rights and home invasions.

5|$|Metformin {{was first}} {{described}} in the scientific literature in 1922, by Emil Werner and James Bell, as a product in the synthesis of N,N-dimethylguanidine. In 1929, Slotta and Tschesche discovered its sugar-lowering action in rabbits, <b>finding</b> <b>it</b> the most potent biguanide analog they studied. This result was completely forgotten, as other guanidine analogs, such as the synthalins, took over and were themselves soon overshadowed by insulin.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium and caesium {{were the}} first {{elements}} to be discovered using the spectroscope, invented in 1859 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff. The next year, they discovered caesium in the mineral water from Bad Dürkheim, Germany. Their discovery of rubidium came the following year in Heidelberg, Germany, <b>finding</b> <b>it</b> in the mineral lepidolite. The names of rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectra: a bright red line for rubidium (from the Latin word rubidus, meaning dark red or bright red), and a sky-blue line for caesium (derived from the Latin word caesius, meaning sky-blue).|$|E
