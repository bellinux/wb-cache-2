40|$|PURPOSE: The {{accurate}} {{prediction of}} x-ray spectra under typical conditions encountered in clinical x-ray examination procedures and {{the assessment of}} factors influencing them has been a longstanding goal of the diagnostic radiology and medical physics communities. In this work, the influence of anode surface roughness on diagnostic x-ray spectra is evaluated using MCNP 4 C-based Monte Carlo simulations. METHODS: An image-based modeling method was used to create realistic models from surface-cracked anodes. An in-house computer program was written to model the geometric pattern of cracks and irregularities from digital images of <b>focal</b> <b>track</b> surface in order to define the modeled anodes into MCNP input file. To consider average roughness and mean crack depth into the models, the surface of anodes was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and surface profilometry. It {{was found that the}} average roughness (Ra) in the most aged tube studied is about 50 pm. The correctness of MCNP 4 C in simulating diagnostic x-ray spectra was thoroughly verified by calling its Gaussian energy broadening card and comparing the simulated spectra with experimentally measured ones. The assessment of anode roughness involved the comparison of simulated spectra in deteriorated anodes with those simulated in perfectly plain anodes considered as reference. From these comparisons, the variations in output intensity, half value layer (HVL), heel effect, and patient dose were studied. RESULTS: An intensity loss of 4. 5 % and 16. 8 % was predicted for anodes aged by 5 and 50 microm deep cracks (50 kVp, 6 degrees target angle, and 2. 5 mm A 1 total filtration). The variations in HVL were not significant as the spectra were not hardened by more than 2. 5 %; however, the trend for this variation was to increase with roughness. By deploying several point detector tallies along the anode-cathode direction and averaging exposure over them, it was found that for a 6 degrees anode, roughened by 50 microm deep cracks, the reduction in exposure is 14. 9 % and 13. 1 % for 70 and 120 kVp tube voltages, respectively. For the evaluation of patient dose, entrance skin radiation dose was calculated for typical chest x-ray examinations. It was shown that as anode roughness increases, patient entrance skin dose decreases averagely by a factor of 15 %. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that the anode surface roughness can have a non-negligible effect on output spectra in aged x-ray imaging tubes and its impact should be carefully considered in diagnostic x-ray imaging modalities...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{quantification}} of microvasculature {{remains of}} interest in fundamental pathophysiological studies and clinical trials. Current photoacoustic microscopy can noninvasively quantify properties of the microvasculature, including vessel density and diameter, with a high spatial resolution. However, the depth range of focus (i. e., focal zone) of optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) is often insufficient to encompass the depth variations of features of interest—such as blood vessels—due to uneven tissue surfaces. Thus, time-consuming image acquisitions at multiple different focal planes are required to maintain the region {{of interest in}} the focal zone. We have developed continuous three-dimensional motorized contour-scanning OR-PAM, which enables real-time adjustment of the <b>focal</b> plane to <b>track</b> the vessels’ profile. We have experimentally demonstrated that contour scanning improves the signal-to-noise ratio of conventional OR-PAM by as much as 41 % and shortens the image acquisition time by 3. 2 times.

40|$|A passive {{acoustic}} monitoring {{device to}} detect bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) presence in two military ranges in Pamlico Sound, NC {{is being developed}} {{by researchers at the}} Duke University Marine Lab. Potential adverse effects of military activities in these ranges include temporary or permanent hearing loss, tissue damage, altered habitat use, and changes in behavior. The real-time passive acoustic monitoring system allows for automated detection of bottlenose dolphin whistles and alerts the Marine Core Air Station (MCAS) Cherry Point when dolphin whistles are detected. Passive acoustic monitoring relies on the detection of vocalizations, so I conducted focal follows coupled with acoustic monitoring to determine group vocalization rates. Dolphins near the ranges produced at least one detectable whistle in 25 % of one-minute bins. Behavioral state and group size affected whistle production, and probability of whistle presence was significantly higher for socializing dolphins and groups of 1 - 2 and 11 - 20 dolphins. I examined <b>focal</b> follow <b>tracks</b> to determine rates of travel and calculated potential residence time for dolphins in the range. The average rate of travel for dolphins in the area was 0. 871 m/s, and rate of travel when traveling was significantly higher than any other behavior state. Residence time was also influenced by behavioral state and group size. The probability of whistle production is sufficient for an automated real-time passive acoustic detection device to detect bottlenose dolphins. Results of this study could be used by MCAS Cherry Point to establish procedures that will mitigate harmful effects to bottlenose dolphins without sacrificing military readiness. This type of system has potential for use at other coastal military ranges, bridge demolitions and other near shore activities posing threats to coastal dolphin populations and other marine mammals...|$|R

APPROACH Beaked whales are notoriously difficult to study, and research on their behavior to a large extent depends on sea state conditions, densities and success to (re) localize animals. During the ONR-funded BRS-study Azores-Baseline 2011 (studying social behavior of Risso’s dolphin, Northern bottlenose whale and short-finned pilot whale), shore-based observations showed regular occurrence of Sowerby’s beaked whales off Terceira Island, Azores.

40|$|Migratory Group V (Stock E 1) {{humpback}} whales Megaptera novaeangliae {{are at risk}} of entanglement with {{fishing gear}} as they migrate north and south along the east coast of Australia. This study investigated the effectiveness of 2 distinct tones for use as an alarm to acoustically alert whales to fishing gear presence and therefore reduce the chance of entanglement. We compared how whales responded in terms of changes of surface behaviour and changes in direction of travel in response to 2 acoustic tones and when there was no alarm. These 2 acoustic tones were a 5 kHz tone (5 s emission interval and 400 ms emission duration, similar to but higher frequency than the signal from a Future Oceans F 3 TM 3 kHz Whale Pinger®) and a 2 - 2. 1 kHz swept tone (8 s emission interval and 1. 5 s emission duration). A total of 108 <b>tracks</b> (<b>focal</b> follows) were collected using a theodolite at Cape Solander, Sydney, Australia, during the whales’ 2013 northern migration. Linear mixed effects models were used to determine the effect of the different acoustic tones on whale direction (heading), and behaviour (dive duration and speed). Whales showed no detectable response to either alarm. Whale direction and surfacing behaviour did not differ whether the alarm was ‘on’ or ‘off’. Although the response may have been different if the alarms were attached to fishing gear, the lack of measurable response suggests that the types of tones used {{are not likely to be}} effective in alarms intended to reduce entanglement of northward migrating Australian humpback whales. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Although {{researchers}} {{have begun to}} explore the implementation of dynamic assessment (DA) with foreign language learners, few of these studies {{have occurred in the}} language classroom. An important difference between contexts of DA research and the classroom concerns the feasibility of one-to-one interactions. That is, while DA has often been framed as dyadic in nature, classroom settings rarely afford this possibility. The present study follows Poehner 2 ̆ 7 s (2009) proposal of group DA (G-DA), wherein classroom activities exceed the current capabilities of all learners and the teacher endeavors to provide mediation, aimed at the class as a collective, in order to diagnose and promote development.

40|$|A basic {{principle}} of long baseline interferometry {{is that an}} optical path difference (OPD) directly translates into an astrometric measurement. In the simplest case, the OPD {{is equal to the}} scalar product between the vector linking the two telescopes and the normalized vector pointing toward the star. However, a too simple interpretation of this scalar product leads to seemingly conflicting results, called here "the baseline paradox". For micro-arcsecond accuracy astrometry, we have to model in full the metrology measurement. It involves a complex system subject to many optical effects: from pure baseline errors to static, quasi-static and high order optical aberrations. The goal {{of this paper is to}} present the strategy used by the "General Relativity Analysis via VLT InTerferometrY" instrument (GRAVITY) to minimize the biases introduced by these defects. It is possible to give an analytical formula on how the baselines and tip-tilt errors affect the astrometric measurement. This formula depends on the limit-points of three type of baselines: the wide-angle baseline, the narrow-angle baseline, and the imaging baseline. We also, numerically, include non-common path higher-order aberrations, whose amplitude were measured during technical time at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. We end by simulating the influence of high-order common-path aberrations due to atmospheric residuals calculated from a Monte-Carlo simulation tool for Adaptive optics systems. The result of this work is an error budget of the biases caused by the multiple optical imperfections, including optical dispersion. We show that the beam stabilization through both <b>focal</b> and pupil <b>tracking</b> is crucial to the GRAVITY system. Assuming the instrument pupil is stabilized at a 4 cm level on M 1, and a field tracking below 0. 2 λ/D, we show that GRAVITY will be able to reach its objective of 10 μas accuracy.

40|$|Knowing what {{is where}} is an {{essential}} and complex component of human perception. This ability refers {{to the concept of}} Situation Awareness (SA). The underlying mechanisms for this ability show parallels to the tracking of a set of identical objects moving on a screen, a theory known as Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) (Pylyshyn 2 ̆ 6 Storm, 1988). This theory was useful for investigating the fundamental factors of visual tracking, but lacked a connection to real-world scenarios. In an attempt to bridge that gap, Oksama and Hyönä (2008) created the Model of Multiple Identity Tracking (MOMIT), which includes unique identities for each object being tracked and posits a combination of peripheral and <b>focal</b> perception in <b>tracking,</b> as opposed to strictly peripheral in the MOT paradigm. This model was then applied to air traffic control (ATC) displays to create a predictive utility for analyzing controllers’ performance (Hope, Rantanen, 2 ̆ 6 Oksama, 2010). However, the call sign objects used in the MIT application study (Hope et al., 2010) only required the observer to remember a single letter from the object’s identity, negating the need to memorize the entire identity. Using a similar structure of typical ATC call signs (6 - 7 character alphanumeric strings), the experiment investigated the study time duration necessary to acquire and retain the identity and location information of complex objects, and in effect, form a level 1 SA. Furthermore, the accuracy of the location-identity bindings formed in level 1 SA are also investigated for various object set sizes (4, 8, or 12 objects). The object array size of 4 had the highest accuracy. As the object set size increased from 4 objects to 12 objects, the error in location information and identity information increased. Finally, it was found that approximately 3 complex ATC-like objects were retained by participants in all conditions...|$|R
40|$|The Rare Isotope Science Project (RISP) was {{established}} in December 2011 in order {{to carry out the}} technical design and the establishment of the accelerator complex (RAON) for the rare isotope science in Korea. The rare isotope accelerator at RAON will provide both stable and rare isotope heavy-ion beams the energy range from a few MeV/nucleon to a few hundreds of MeV/nucleon for researches in fields of basic and applied science. Large Acceptance Multipurpose Spectrometer (LAMPS) at RAON is a heavy-ion collision experimental facility for studying nuclear symmetry energy by using rare isotope beams. Two different experimental setups of LAMPS are designed for covering entire energy range at RAON. One is for low energy (< 18. 5 MeV/nucleon) heavy-ion collision experiment for day- 1 experiments. This experimental setup consists of an array of ΔE-E Si-CsI detectors, a gamma array to cover backward polar angle, and a forward neutron wall. The other is for completing an event reconstruction by detecting all the particles produced in high energy heavy-ion collisions within a large acceptance angle to measure particle spectrum, yield, ratio and collective flow of pions, protons, neutrons, and intermediate fragments at the same time. The experimental setup consists of a superconducting spectrometer, a dipole spectrometer, and a forward neutron wall.

Development was further examined based on students' scores on a post-test, near transcendence task and far transcendence task. Findings suggest that while some students moved from assisted to unassisted performance during large group DA, other students required peer mediation provided during small group work to develop interrogative use and formation. Those students who could perform independently during large group DA acted as mediators during small group work for those who still required mediation. Still other students were never able to use and form questions independently, indicating that interrogative use and formation was not within their zone of proximal development. It was concluded that DA can be integrated into the language curriculum of early language learning programs without the sacrifice of effective language pedagogy. To that end, small group work is an essential complement to large group DA in that it provides students with the opportunity to request mediation, verbalize their thoughts, and provide mediation to their peers...|$|R

The advantage over equivalent RF systems in space weight, power, and swept volume is great when applied to NASA satellite communications networks. A photograph of the 3 -channel prototype constructed under the present contract to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept is presented. The telescope has a 10 -inch clear aperture and a 22 deg full field of view. It consists of 4 refractive elements to achieve a telecentric focus, i. e., the focused beam is normal to the focal plane at all field angles. This feature permits image pick-up optics in the <b>focal</b> plane to <b>track</b> satellite images without tilting their optic axes to accommodate field angle. The geometry of the imager-pick-up concept and the coordinate system of the swinging arm and disk mechanism for image pick-up are shown. Optics in the arm relay the telescope focus to a communications and tracking receiver and introduce the transmitted beacon beam on a path collinear with the receive path. The electronic circuits for the communications and tracking receivers are contained on the arm and disk assemblies and relay signals to an associated PC-based operator's console {{for control of the}} arm and disk motor drive through a flexible cable which permits +/- 240 deg travel for each arm and disk assembly.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{composition and}} structure of a temperate montane forest called Samage at Baimaxueshan National Nature Reserve in Yunnan, {{one of the last}} refuges for the highly endangered black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti). There is a patchwork of vegetation types at Samage, and we distinguished 6 major land cover types within the home range of the <b>focal</b> group. We <b>tracked</b> the semihabituated Gehuaqing band for a full annual cycle to study their habitat utilization and altitudinal ranging. We analyzed the group’s selective use of particular habitat types via selection ratios. We calculated habitat availability from a GIS database. We found that they used mixed deciduous broadleaf/conifer forest disproportionately to its availability in all months. Subjects completely avoided meadows. Pine and evergreen broadleaf forests acted as corridors between patches of mixed forest and monkeys visited them occasionally, but at low frequencies and mostly in transit. The focal band stayed at elevations ranging from ca. 2600 m to 4000 m, and the mean elevation usedis 3200 m. We found evidence for seasonal variation in use of elevational zones. The band stayed at significantly higher elevations in summer than in spring. The descent in spring was likely related to a flush of immature leaves at low-lying elevations. Availability of preferred fruits also had a highly positive influence on altitudinal ranging, i. e., during months with high fruit availability (late summer, early fall), the band stayed at medium elevations where preferred fruits were most abundant. Higher concentrations of lichens and the snub-nosed monkeys’ search for not yet depleted fruits probably caused them to remain at mid-elevations in winter. There is no significant correlation between climate parameters and elevation used. One of the main inferences of this investigation is that, contrary to previous accounts, Rhinopithecus bieti is not universally associated with high-elevation dark fir forest, but at Samage exhibits an overwhelming preference for mixed forest. Moreover, our analyses support the hypothesis that elevational migration, in this temperate-subtropical forest, is influenced by the temporal fruiting of major food trees and that climate has only a negligible effect on elevation use...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The co-dependency of {{bone and}} muscle is {{exemplified}} by concomitant catabolic and/or anabolic tissue adaptations, as induced by respective decreases or increases in mechanical loading. Given that muscular contraction {{is responsible for}} skeletal loading during normal locomotion, this co-dependency {{has been attributed to}} an indirect consequence of muscle function. However, recent data from our group and others now indicate that direct communication between muscles, nerves and bone can significantly alter bone homeostasis independent of mechanical loading. In this dissertation, three independent studies explored the relation between impaired muscle function and bone homeostasis using our murine model in which rapid and profound bone loss is induced in the tibia following transient paralysis of the calf muscles. In the first study, we quantified endocortical expansion in the tibial diaphysis following transient muscle paralysis using a novel microCT image registration approach. This approach identified a complex, but highly repeatable, resorptive response implicating osteoclast recruitment and focal activation of osteoclastic resorption underlies the spatially consistent endocortical resorption induced by transient muscle paralysis. Importantly, this study also validated the use of serial microCT image registration to <b>track</b> <b>focal</b> bone alterations. In the second study, we characterized the spatiotemporal parameters of bone resorption in our model, which revealed that tibia metaphyseal and diaphyseal bone loss induced by transient calf paralysis are spatially and temporally discrete events. By expanding our image registration approach, we determined that the initiating event in acute bone loss (within 3 days of paralysis) occurs in the proximal tibia metaphysis as a result of enhanced activity of resident osteoclasts adjacent to the growth plate. In contrast to the focal activation of osteoclasts in the proximal metaphysis, bone loss occurs throughout the diaphysis between 6 and 13 days post-paralysis; an observation that is temporally consistent with de novo osteoclastogenesis as a mediator of the diaphyseal resorption. These findings clarified the timing and origins of discrete resorptive events and allowed for investigation of the upstream cellular mechanisms responsible for their initiation. In the final study, we sought to determine if bone loss induced by transient muscle paralysis is a result of neurogenic inflammation of the bone marrow, which leads to enhanced osteoclastogenesis. Though attempts to suppress inflammatory mechanisms were unable to block bone loss following paralysis, we were able to demonstrate that inflammatory cell infiltration, pro-osteoclastogenic inflammatory gene expression and an alterations in bone marrow osteoclastogenic permissiveness occurred in a manner temporally consistent with observed bone loss. Further, we identified giant osteoclast formation, implicating enhanced osteoclast fusion as a potential mechanism for the extensive bone resorption. Taken together, these studies defined the spatiotemporal origins and potential mechanisms (enhanced osteoclast function in the metaphysis and de novo giant cell osteoclastogenesis in the diaphysis) of bone loss following transient muscle paralysis. More broadly, by characterizing the rapid and spatially distinct bone loss precipitated by transient muscle paralysis, we have provided evidence that muscle and bone are directly coupled and that altered muscle function can activate cellular events that profoundly alter bone homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} occurrence, behaviour, spatial distribution, and {{temporal}} distribution of cetaceans in the Greater Dyer Island area, Western Cape, South Africa. Three main methods were used in the study: Analysis of data from a local whale-watching vessel (WWV) (2000 2012), visual land-based theodolite tracking (during four southern right whale seasons (August December) from 2011 2014 and one summer/autumn season in 2013), and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) using a single bottom moored hydrophone (DSG-Ocean Loggerhead) in the months of January/February, September, and October, 2014). Methods were chosen, due to suitability, cost efficiency, and because they complement each other. Data from the WWV covered more than a ten-year period and provided indications of temporal and spatial distribution trends, but data were limited with respect to survey effort and behavioural data. Shore-based observations provided spatial, temporal, and behaviour patterns of the cetacean species in the area, but the method is labour intensive, requires daylight and is restricted by weather conditions. PAM could be conducted 24 hours a day and in poor weather conditions and enabled a temporal extension of the monitoring of cetaceans in the area, but individual hydrophones, are expensive and can break down or be lost. Simultaneous visual observations and PAM were used to investigate the vocalisation patterns of southern right whales and the possibility of using PAM to monitor presence of southern right whales. An analysis of the consistency and validity of the opportunistic data from the WWV was conducted before the data was used in a spatial and temporal analysis. The Consistency Index (CI) was defined as the proportion of times a data field was recorded per total number of trips during all years. The validity of the data were assessed to determine accuracy of the data. The validity and consistency analysis of the sighting records revealed that the dataset was useful but data fields varied considerably in their consistency of collection. The trip duration and route was recorded in less than 5 % of cases, making analysis of temporal and spatial patterns difficult. The validity of species identification was excellent with 100 % agreement between observer records and photographic documentation in 152 encounters of seven cetacean species. Behavioural data were described in overly subjective terms, thus not allowing for any analysis of patterns. The analysis also resulted in a list of suggestions for the design of future observation sheets, and data collection methods and {{the development and implementation of}} worldwide standards are encouraged (guidelines and protocols), which should address different levels and scenarios of data collection from WWV. This work has made a novel contribution to the global research field by submission of a paper and direct communication with the whale watching subcommittee at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) concerning content in the International guidelines for platform of opportunity guiding principles on data collection. An analysis of opportunistic cetacean sightings from the local WWV consisted of more than 5500 cetacean encounters during more than 2500 trips from 2003 to 2012. Results were twofold; 1) discovering that there are five main cetacean species using the area: Southern right whales (Eubalaena australis), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), Bryde s whales (Balaenoptera brydeii), Indian Ocean humpback dolphins (Sousa plumbea), and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) and providing spatial and temporal distribution patterns for these species as well as the first long-term, year round dataset for this area. Three other species of incidental visitors were: Common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), killer whales (Orcinus orca) and Heaviside s dolphins (Cephalorhynchus heavisidii). 2) Showing that opportunistic data of cetacean encounters collected regularly from a WWV constitute an important source of baseline information of the wildlife abundance and distribution. Caveats and limitations of data from the WWV are discussed and advice regarding data collection from platforms of opportunities are provided. Particularly, the lack of basic data on search effort and of clearly defined behavioural categories is emphasised and standardisation of guidelines for data-collection methods worldwide is suggested. Southern right whales were by far the most frequently occurring cetaceans with a marked seasonal presence from August to December. Numbers peaked consistently between June and January each year and only a single encounter was recorded between 31 January and 26 May in the entire dataset. They appeared either as unaccompanied adults (UAs), as part of surface active groups (SAGs) or as cows accompanied by their calves (cc-pairs). Single right whales were more commonly encountered at the beginning of high season (June September) while groups of two or more were most commonly encountered in the middle of the season (July September) and the modal group size was two. Cow-calf pairs were encountered most frequently late in the season with highest encounters in October December. All right whales were predominantly located close to shore, as were the two main dolphin species. Bryde s whales and humpback whales were located farther from shore. Bryde s whales were observed in all years, except 2006. The highest encounter of Bryde s whales were between March and May. Bryde s whale calves were encountered year round. The highest number of encounters occurred during 2003 (n= 25), dropping to 0 in 2006 and then slowly increased at 1 % per annum after 2006. Humpback whales showed two peaks in seasonality: the majority of animals were encountered in June (last month of low season), July and August, with a much smaller peak in late November and December. Most encounters with humpback whale cow-calf pairs occurred during October December. Humpback whale encounters varied considerably from year to year, with most encounters in 2008 (n= 28), 2011 (n= 15), and 2012 (n= 12), but showed a slow average increase at 0. 4 % per annum. Encounters of Indian Ocean humpback dolphins were more frequent during summer months, and most encounters occurred in 2003 - 2007 and in 2011, a slightly negative annual trend existed (0. 9 %). Calves were mainly encountered occurring in December (n = 25) and January (n = 12). Indo- Pacific bottlenose dolphins showed a clear seasonal peak occurred from December to April and most encounters occurred in 2004 - 2006 and in 2009 with a slightly negative annual trend over time (0. 2 %). Seasonality of calves followed the same pattern of as adults. This study was the first to reveal that there are five cetacean species using the area and provide temporal and spatial patterns based on long term data. Shore-based observations, using a surveyor s theodolite, enabled an analysis of behaviour in addition to confirming the spatial and temporal distributions of cetacean species obtained from the WWV-data. Hourly scans were conducted to provide information on species presence, location, group size, group composition, and surface behaviour. In addition, focal groups that were tracked provided and detailed information on movements and behaviours. Effort totalled 1558 hours and 26 minutes (1204 scans) over 270 days between 24 August 2011 and 11 December 2014. All sighting data were filtered to remove periods of poor weather conditions, only observations collected at sea state ? 2 for dolphin species, and ? 5 for baleen whales were analysed. The area is an important location for nursing and socialising southern right whales and it might be a summer feeding area for Bryde s whales. The primarily observed behaviour of humpback whales was travelling and 80 % of the tracked animals were travelling south-east towards Cape Agulhas. Finally, it was found that the area serves as a year round socialising and resting area for the two dolphin species. Swimming speed was calculated, using the longest focal follow from each day for southern right whales and all <b>focal</b> follow <b>tracks</b> of dolphin species. All southern right whales were found to be swimming at a speed less than 5. 1 km/h. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. tm 2016 Zoology and EntomologyPhDUnrestricte...|$|R
