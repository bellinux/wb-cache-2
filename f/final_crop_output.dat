The GARCH (1, 1) model was used to generate the food <b>crop</b> <b>output</b> volatility. A combination of descriptive analysis and analysis of variance model (ANOVA) based on OLS estimation technique was used to analyze data.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{economic}} effects of biodiversity loss on marketable agricultural output for intensive agricultural systems, which require an increasing level of artificial capital inputs. A theoretical bio-economic model {{is used to}} derive a hypothesis {{about the effect of}} the state of biodiversity on the optimal <b>crop</b> <b>output</b> both in the longer run and in the transitional path towards the steady-state equilibrium. The hypothesised positive relationship between biodiversity stock and optimal levels of <b>crop</b> <b>output</b> is empirically tested using a stochastic production frontier approach, based on data from a panel of UK specialised cereal farms for the period 1989 - 2000. The results support the theoretical hypothesis. Increases in biodiversity can lead to a continual outward shift in the output frontier (although at a decreasing rate), controlling for the relevant set of labour and capital inputs. Agricultural transition towards biodiversity conservation may be consistent with an increase in <b>crop</b> <b>output</b> in already biodiversity-poor modern agricultural landscapes.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to examine price performance, and estimate the aggregate export and food <b>crop</b> <b>output</b> response to output price and non-price variables in tropical Africa and its four main agro-climatic regions. The analysis of real producer prices indicates {{that there are more}} countries that exhibited a statistically significant decrease in real producer prices than a significant increase. Moreover, nominal protection coefficient analysis shows that African crop exporters, on average, received a small proportion (50 to 60 percent) of border prices. Using pooled cross-section and time series data, a partial adjustment model was then specified to estimate agricultural export and food output response. The results show that aggregate agricultural export and food supply responses to output prices in tropical Africa are both positive and significant but inelastic. The price elasticity for the export <b>crop</b> <b>output</b> in Tropical Africa is 0. 02 in the short run and 0. 04 in the long run, and for the food <b>crop</b> <b>output</b> 0. 05 in the short-run and 0. 07 in the long-run. The responsiveness of agriculture varies, however, across the main agro-climatic regions in tropical Africa. The estimated coefficient of the price variable and price elasticity estimates regions reveal that producers in the Eastern and Southern Africa, and Western Africa regions were responsive to price incentives, while producers in the semi-arid Sudano Sahel and Central Africa regions were not. The trend variable, as proxy of technology, is positive and significant in most regions, suggesting that the provision of non-price factors along with favourable price incentives, could be very effective in raising agricultural production in these regions...|$|R
