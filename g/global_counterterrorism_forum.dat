40|$|Created {{as part of}} the 2016 Jackson School for International Studies SIS 495 : Task Force. On October 11, 2011 then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton {{wrote an}} article for Foreign Affairs, titled “America’s Pacific Century”. In it she states that over the past decade U. S. {{attention}} has been preoccupied with conflicts in the Middle East, specifically ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. She argues that the magnitude of U. S. resources and attention spent on these wars has been a mistake, and that {{it is important for the}} U. S. to refocus its energy on areas of the world that can deliver the greatest return on our investments, such as the Asia-­Pacific region. She makes it is clear that in this century Asia will experience more growth than any other region in the world and many Asia-­Pacific nations are set to take center stage in the global geopolitical arena of the future. The region is home to nearly half the world’s population and already some the most explosive centers of economic growth anywhere around the globe;; therefore it is in the interest of the U. S. to devote a heightened level of engagement with this 4 region. Asia also presents some of the most considerable challenges the world will face in the coming decades. For example, Asia faces numerous problems, including extreme pollution, North Korea’s unpredictable and unstable nuclear weapons proliferation, cyber security breaches, and territorial disputes in the South China Sea. The rise of China and the rapid growth of other emerging economies in the area will also mark a turning point as power and influence begins to shift away from the U. S. The pivot outlined in her article focuses on strengthening partnerships with emerging powers particularly in Southeast Asia, further steps in engendering a stable relationship with China, solidifying and expanding regional economic structures, supporting multilateral institutions, and empowering traditional allies. Clinton’s Recommendations As Clinton remarked in her article, these developments will require the U. S. to engage in deliberate rebalancing of resources and attention to the Asia-­Pacific region. This pivot will consist of increased people to people interactions across the pacific. So the U. S. must remain in a continuous diplomatic dialogue with our historic allies Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, and Thailand to strengthen our current bilateral relationships. Further attention to our relationships with emerging countries in the regions such as China, India, Indonesia, Singapore, New Zealand, Malaysia, Mongolia, Vietnam, and Brunei is still necessary in the decades to come. The U. S. needs to also play an active role and maintain a constant presence in the multinational institutions of the region including APEC and ASEAN. Due to the rapid growth of emerging economies in Asia-­Pacific, the U. S. has an interest in increasing trade and investment in the region by effectuating the Trans-­Pacific Partnership 5 agreement. The pivotal agreement will lower trade tariffs and implement regulations to improve the welfare of workers and protect the environment in the twelve participating Pacific Rim countries. The U. S. must also assist and encourage other nations including China to join the TPP, and complete additional free trade agreements such as the KORUS-­FTA with South Korea. In order to ensure the free flow of commerce, the U. S. must maintain its historic role of security guarantor of its allies and protecter international shipping lanes. This means ensuring that freedom of navigation is enforced in compliance with international law, especially in disputed territories such as the East China Sea and South China Sea. We must also strengthen and modernize our current bilateral security alliances with Japan, South Korea, and Australia. While developing new alliances and partnerships with emerging powers in Asia-­Pacific, and increase military-­to-­military dialogue with China to dispel fears their government may have of the U. S. implementing a containment strategy against them. What has been done? Since 2011, the U. S. has taken measures to enhance engagement in the Asia-­Pacific by increasing the number of presidential visits to Asian nations, establishing the <b>Global</b> <b>Counterterrorism</b> <b>Forum,</b> and developing the U. S. -­China Climate Change Working Group. As of 2016, the heads of state from twelve nations, which make up approximately 40 % of the global economy, signed the TPP, initiating a pact that will facilitate investment and linkage between the major economies in Asia and establish an economic architecture in the region. Militarily, the U. S. has increased its presence in Southeast Asia by deploying littoral combat ships to Singapore and Marines to Darwin, Australia. 6 The Obama Administration has made several efforts to increase the U. S. presence in Asia and show dedication to the region’s growth and stability;; however, there has been criticism toward U. S. effort or lackthereof in truly pivoting to Asia. Critics scrutinize the U. S. for continuing over-­investment in foreign affairs in the Middle East and prioritizing issues like the Iran Nuclear Deal, the Syrian Civil War, and combatting ISIS. However, many of the U. S. actions to pivot toward Asia have gone underappreciated, as they tend to take place behind the scenes and are less concrete than establishing a treaty, such as the efforts to rebalance the U. S. government’s time commitment dedicated to Asia. Already, within the first month of 2016, Secretary of State John Kerry has visited Laos, Cambodia, and China to build strong relationships and foster open communication. In the first seven years of his term, President Obama visited Asia seven different times setting a precedent for future administrations to maintain a continuous dialogue with the Asia-­Pacific leaders. These visits to strengthen economic, diplomatic, and strategic ties in Asia-­Pacific are advancing U. S. presence and influence in the region, just as the Pivot to Asia intended. Additionally, although the TPP has taken five years to be implemented, those five years were spent conducting important meetings with government officials and drafting, modifying, and signing the treaty in order to make the agreement accommodating and optimizing to all parties involved. Once in place, the TPP will have enormous positive ramifications on economic growth and prosperity across the Pacific Rim and will be the cornerstone of the economic Pivot to Asia. 7 The Future of the Pivot The Obama Administration has strived to make increasing engagement and strengthening relationships in the Asia-­Pacific a priority. The 2016 presidential election creates a sense of urgency for prioritizing the Pivot to Asia and solidifying a strategic plan to consolidate our gains and expand our leadership role in Asia. The results of this election will impact U. S. influence, alliances, and involvement in Asia’s growth and stability. Electing a president who is not focused on reallocating attention and resources to Asia could have serious ramifications on the progress the U. S. has made in proving its commitment to growth in Asia. After five years of increased engagement in the Asia Pacific, the U. S. must continue to modify and update its Asian foreign policy in order to secure its role in the region as a leader;; but what exactly should the modifications entail? Rebalancing United States’ resources and attention toward Asia is a long term endeavour. As the U. S. implements the Pivot to Asia, its officials need to continually evaluate and update our foreign strategy. This paper will evaluate current bilateral and multilateral relationships between the U. S., its allies, and other partners in the Asia-­Pacific, specifically analyzing the dominant economic, diplomatic, and security issues that have developed since Clinton’s article in 2011. Some of the biggest issues the U. S. faces in Asia-­Pacific can be organized into three main sub-­categories: Diplomacy, Economics and Security. In this paper we will recommend that the U. S. pursue specific policies that will build on the achievements of the Obama administration's pivot, address the shortcomings of the rebalancing strategy, and promote new ideas that support America’s interests in the Asia-­Pacific region. 8 Policy Recommendations Diplomatic affairs with dominant countries in Asia including, Japan, China and South Korea and countries on the peripheries such as, India and Australia, are crucial to establishing a strong U. S. leadership role in Asia-­Pacific. The U. S. must prove to China that an increase in U. S. presence in Asia is not an attempt to undermine or contain China’s rise to power. Strong and transparent diplomatic engagement is the key to the advancement of core U. S. interests such as human rights, trade, nonproliferation, and democracy. For this reason, we recommend the U. S. establishes a Northeast Asian Regional (NEAR) Dialogue Forum to promote collaborative discussion among allies and non-­allies alike. The NEAR will expand from existing forums like APEC Summit, East Asia Summit, and the Six Party Talks. In addition to creating NEAR and opening other multilateral dialogues, the U. S. needs to further develop intergovernmental relationships with growing Asian nations by continuing to increase state visits in the region to maintain positive relations with nations in the region, particularly ones home to American forces. Expanding economic involvement in Asia-­Pacific requires increased transparency and encouragement for reform for multilateral trade agreements. The TPP is at the heart of securing U. S. involvement in Asia’s rapidly growing economy. Strengthening the trade agreement could smooth cross-­border movement of goods, link growing economies, enhance domestic working conditions as well as further expand international trade. The U. S. must address the TPP and other multilateral organizations, like the WTO and ASEAN, from the perspective of Asian nations, to assure that U. S. foreign policy accommodates the needs of its Asian counterparts. How the U. S. combats strategic security issues in the Asia-­Pacific in the next few years could determine the level commercial freedom, nuclear stability and cyber security structure in 9 the region as well as shape our diplomatic and military alliances. To resolve the South China Sea disputes over freedom of navigation, the U. S. must ratify UNCLOS while increasing military presence to stabilize the region and open access to various trade routes, furthering economic growth possibilities. In order to prevent security threats and breaches, the U. S. needs to promote and establish a set of norms and enforceable regulations that can be recognized and ratified by the international community, as well as establish multilateral agreements to counter terrorism and extremist groups. Additionally, to assert U. S. military influence in Asia, we need to increase naval basing. Lastly, North Korea is an unstable state and the threat of its unpredictable nuclear program is detrimental to not only regional security, but the global community. Working to solve these security conflicts will simultaneously advance diplomatic ties with allied nations and open up additional trade routes to increase economic prosperity in the region. We can summarize our policy recommendations in four actions that address the U. S. ’ interests in the Asia-­Pacific. ● ENCOURAGE REFORM in multilateral trade agreements to protect and advance U. S. investment and trade in the Asia-­Pacific region and foster an inclusive economic environment. ● INCREASE TRANSPARENCY and accountability via binding agreements in order to mitigate interregional mistrust and ensure long-­standing, stable partnerships. ● STRENGTHEN REGIONAL ALLIANCES bilaterally and multilaterally through strategic military fortification and intensified diplomatic dialogues. ● PROVIDE LEADERSHIP on economic and political issues facing the Asia-­Pacific region to bolster U. S. inclusion and relevance...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedTerrorism {{is the principal}} threat to global and national security in the post- 11 September world. Facing terrorist threats at home and abroad, the United States has declared counterterrorism its top priority. As the United States embarks on its <b>global</b> <b>counterterrorism</b> campaign, it must draw {{on the experience of}} other countries. Specifically India, with an extensive history of counterterrorism efforts, can reveal important lessons applicable to America's endeavors. India offers three primary examples of counterterrorism strategies: Punjab, its northeast region, and Kashmir, from which four findings emerge. First, aggressive military operations are central to beating terrorism. Second, economic and social development programs, though not enough to end terrorism alone, are essential components of the larger national strategy. Third, terrorism cannot be stopped without international assistance. Terror networks export personnel, knowledge, weapons and money across international boundaries with growing frequency. This cannot be effectively stopped without a coordinated national and international effort. Fourth, to be successful, a counterterrorism strategy must engender the public's support for the government and promulgate a sense of public ownership to the conflict. By applying these lessons from the Indian case study, America's efforts to end terrorism both domestically and internationally will be significantly more productive.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 07 "Militant Bodies" {{explores the}} long history of the Sikh as a racialized and religionized figure that violently troubled imperial, postcolonial, and {{national}} fantasies of security. From the British colonial period, to the Indian nationalist movements of the early twentieth century, to the era of decolonization and India/Pakistan Partition, to the genocidal pogroms of 1984, and finally to the global war on terror: the Sikh was simultaneously a nebulous and disruptive force to U. S. racial, religious, and gendered normative orders. Through close readings of English and Punjabi language texts and artifacts drawn from North American, British, and South Asian archives, this project illuminates how Sikhs were related to other “Asiatic” migrant figures by anxious authorities and publics. By combining historical, literary, and cultural studies methods, this project demonstrates how anti-Asian discourses continue to haunt contemporary liberal efforts to paint the Sikh diasporic body as a docile “model minority” and patriotic American citizen. More broadly, "Militant Bodies" argues that late nineteenth century techniques of inter-imperial security developed by British, Canadian, and American authorities have mutated into new interlocking forms of policing and surveillance: multicultural “tolerance” and <b>global</b> <b>counterterrorism.</b> At the same time, this project shows how Sikhs have creatively and militantly struggled against policing to represent themselves and their collective political and ethical desires. In this "Militant Bodies" demonstrates that Sikhs have, at various historical moments, radically allied themselves with others in anti-colonial, anti-racist, anti-capitalist, and interfaith movements...|$|R

40|$|Critical theory avows that “where {{there is}} power {{there is always}} resistance”.

In this article, I argue that such an agenda of “resistance through memory” has already been put forth in the Global South (specifically, Latin America).

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophySecurity Studies Interdepartmental ProgramMichael KryskoDavid R. StoneSince September 11, 2001, the CIA and DoD have {{operated}} together in Afghanistan, Iraq, and during counterterrorism operations. Although the Global War on Terrorism gave the CIA and DoD a common purpose, it was actions {{taken in the}} late eighties and early nineties that set the foundation for their current relationship. Driven by the post-Cold War environment and lessons learned during military operations, policymakers made intelligence support to the military the Intelligence Community’s top priority. In response to this demand, the CIA/DoD instituted policy and organizational changes that altered the CIA/DoD relationship. While debates {{over the future of}} the Intelligence Community were occurring on Capitol Hill, the CIA and DoD were expanding their relationship in peacekeeping and nation-building operations in Somalia and the Balkans. By the late 1990 ’s, some policymakers and national security professionals became concerned that intelligence support to military operations had gone too far, weakening the long-term analysis required for strategy and policy development. Despite these concerns, no major changes to either national intelligence organizations or its priorities were implemented. These concerns were forgotten after 9 / 11, as the United States fought two wars and policymakers increasingly focused on tactical and operational actions. As policymakers became fixated with terrorism and the United States fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, the CIA focused a significant amount of its resources towards <b>global</b> <b>counterterrorism</b> efforts and in support of military operations. The CIA/DoD operational relationship has led to successes such as the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, but CIA’s counterterrorism and military support requirements have placed a significant burden on the organization. As the United States’ only independent intelligence organization, the CIA was conceived to separate the collection of intelligence from the institutions that develop and execute policy. The CIA’s increased focus on support to military and counterterrorism operations weakens this separation, reduces its focus on strategic issues, and risks subordination to the DoD. The CIA and DoD are the ones immediately affected by this evolving relationship, but it is policymaker preference for military force and the militarization of foreign policy that has led both organizations down this path...|$|R
40|$|In my dissertation, I {{investigate}} a largely unexplored question {{of differences in}} the scope and brutality of states 2 ̆ 7 responses to terrorism using statistical analysis of 15 states, the former Soviet republics of the USSR (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan), studied over 13 years (1993 - 2005), and in-depth cases studies of Estonia, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan. I use event data collection techniques to generate data on different aspects of foreign and domestic counterterrorism measures of the post-Soviet states. ^ The purpose of the statistical analysis {{is to examine the}} impact of those factors that have been traditionally viewed as the key determinants of states 2 ̆ 7 counterterrorism responses. I test the influence of terrorism, states 2 ̆ 7 material capabilities, political regime, political conflict, <b>global</b> <b>counterterrorism</b> and human rights norms, {{as well as a number}} of control variables on states 2 ̆ 7 responses to terrorism. The hypotheses tested in the dissertation are derived from two theoretical approaches to states 2 ̆ 7 behavior, namely, Rationalism and Constructivism. The results of the statistical tests demonstrate that, although the identified conditions are important for explaining states 2 ̆ 7 responses to terrorism, they are insufficient to account for the full range of variation in the scope and brutality of counterterrorism measures. ^ To gain a better understanding of states 2 ̆ 7 counterterrorism policies, I suggest focusing on the reference groups of states that governments look to for policy guidance. The scope and brutality of a state 2 ̆ 7 s counterterrorism policies largely depend on the types of counterterrorism measures promoted by the state 2 ̆ 7 s reference groups. The reference group is a state or a group of states, which perspectives policy-makers use for interpreting and responding to various situations encountered in the realms of domestic and international politics. With respect to counterterrorism, a reference group is a group of states that guide and orient other states 2 ̆ 7 responses to terrorism by (1) endorsing and enforcing principles of counterterrorism activities; and (2) providing information about the legitimacy and effectiveness of counterterrorism policies. In my dissertation, I develop and utilize the reference group perspective for explaining counterterrorism policies of the former republics of the Soviet Union. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a conference focused on identifying good practices in using the Internet to undermine the appeal of terrorism, to expose its lack of legitimacy and its negative impact, and to undermine the credibility of its messengers. The conference was held by the United Nations Counterterrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF), Working Group on Use of the Internet for Terrorist Purposes Riyadh, on 24 - 26 January 2011. The Internet is a key way for violent extremists to encourage others to adopt their views. In their messaging to potential supporters and vulnerable audiences, extremists use simplistic analysis and offer violent solutions to problems that span a range of complex social, economic and political issues at both a local and global level. Finding effective ways to counter such messages {{was at the heart of}} discussions at the Riyadh Conference on the “Use of the Internet to Counter the Appeal of Extremist Violence. ” Co-hosted by the United Nations Counterterrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF) and the Naif Arab University for Security Sciences in Riyadh in partnership with the Center on <b>Global</b> <b>Counterterrorism</b> Cooperation, and supported by the Governments of Germany and Saudi Arabia, the Riyadh conference followed two previous meetings of the CTITF Internet Working Group, one on legal aspects of the use of the Internet for terrorist purposes, and the other on technical aspects. [1] The conference brought together around 150 policy-makers, experts and practitioners from the public sector, international organisations, industry, academia and the media. Several States participated at ministerial or ambassadorial level. The choice of Saudi Arabia as a venue reflected its considerable effort to identify effective counter-terrorism measures, including in combating terrorist use of the Internet and in constructing and delivering effective counter-narratives. The conference focused on identifying good practices in using the Internet to undermine the appeal of terrorism, to expose its lack of legitimacy and its negative impact, and to undermine the credibility of its messengers. Key themes included the importance of identifying the target audience, crafting effective messages, identifying credible messengers, and using appropriate media to reach vulnerable communities. The Conference agreed that Governments might not always be best placed to lead this work and needed the cooperation of civil society, the private sector, academia, the media and victims of terrorism. Given the global nature of terrorist narratives and the need to counter them in the same space, there was a special role for the United Nations in facilitating discussion and action. This report includes a list of possible follow-up projects, further recommendations, and a summary of the discussion.  ...|$|R

At the same time, you will be perhaps surprised to discover that the greatest problem in U. S. detention policy in the past decade has been neither its legality nor its wisdom but rather-mammoth volumes of litigation, legislation, and literary attention notwithstanding-that 2 ̆ 2 we pretend that we do not engage in detention 2 ̆ 2 (p. 9). Although one wishes regularly for some greater definition of precisely which 2 ̆ 2 we 2 ̆ 2 Wittes means, he is undoubtedly right that debates about U. S. detention policy in the past decade have been beset by a kind of irrationality unfortunately familiar in democratic discourse on matters of national security. Politicians, for example, unrealistically insist that any detention regime be foolproof, or stoke fears that having any terrorist suspect held on U. S. soil poses an unmanageable security risk (pp. 8 - 9). But Wittes 2 ̆ 7 s book neither sheds new light on the causes underlying such unfortunate features of democratic debate nor analyzes how one might better structure decisionmaking on such fraught questions of law and security. Indeed, his criticisms of the political process on these issues are followed paradoxically by a call for greater congressional engagement. Instead, Detention and Denial is better taken as a version of Wittes 2 ̆ 7 s argument for why the current system of rules the United States has for detaining terrorist suspects fails substantively to meet our policy needs...|$|R
