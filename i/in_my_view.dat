25|$|The {{argument}} {{was made in}} the nineteenth century by a scholar hostile to what the Malleus stood for that the approbation was a forgery by Institoris and that Sprenger {{had nothing to do with}} the composition. The evidence for this is <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>view</b> very tenuous (and the main argument is clearly invalid). Nonetheless, once the {{argument was}} put forward, it took on a life of its own, and people continue to advance arguments in favor of the idea that Sprenger's involvement was a falsification perpetrated by Institoris, despite the fact that this argument was vitiated from the start.|$|E
25|$|The proper policy, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>view,</b> {{should be}} to affirm the status of physician-assisted suicide and {{euthanasia}} as illegal. In so doing we would affirm that as a society we condemn ending a patient's life and do not consider that to have one's life ended by a doctor is a right. This does not mean we deny that in exceptional cases interventions are appropriate, as acts of desperation when all other elements of treatment—all medications, surgical procedures, psychotherapy, spiritual care, and so on—have been tried. Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made.|$|E

The first sentence of his first chapter reads, “I set fire to my Bible on the playing fields of my Cambridge boarding school one bright, windy spring afternoon in 1967.” One senses the deep—and, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>view,</b> healthy—feeling of self-disgust with which he wrote this, for indeed it describes an act of wickedness.

500|$|Takemitsu's {{sensitivity}} to instrumental and orchestral timbre {{can be heard}} throughout his work, and is often made apparent by the unusual instrumental combinations he specified. This is evident in works such as November Steps, that combine traditional Japanese instruments, shakuhachi and biwa, with a conventional Western orchestra. It may also be discerned in his works for ensembles that make no use of traditional instruments, for example Quotation of Dream (1991), Archipelago S., for 21 players (1993), and ArcI & II (1963–66/1976). In these works, the more conventional orchestral forces are divided into unconventional [...] "groups". Even where these instrumental combinations were determined by the particular ensemble commissioning the work, [...] "Takemitsu's genius for instrumentation (and genius it was, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>view)</b> ...", {{in the words of}} Oliver Knussen, [...] "... creates the illusion that the instrumental restrictions are self-imposed".|$|E

Häkkinen stated that his good start was instigated by modifications made to his car's engine. His win was praised by the Vice President of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport Norbert Haug. [...] "Mika had a great race," [...] he said. [...] "His victory may have looked easy, but {{it was tough to}} achieve and <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>view</b> this was one of his best drives ever." [...] Michael Schumacher said that although he was unable to catch Häkkinen, he was happy to finish in second position. Coulthard said that he believed that his car's suffered from balance issues before taking his first pit stop which accounted for his lack of pace. He also added that spending time behind back-markers during the second stint hindered his attempts to overtake Michael Schumacher but admitted that third position was his best possible result.|$|E

500|$|Explaining how Ben Stiller {{came to be}} cast in {{the role}} of Greg, Roach states: [...] "I saw Meet the Parents as an anxiety dream, and <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>view</b> nobody plays that kind of {{material}} better than Ben." [...] Additionally, Roach was impressed with Stiller's creative and ad lib abilities stating that [...] "he has lots of great ideas and he's very skilled at loose improvisation." [...] Stiller's character Gaylord [...] "Greg" [...] Focker is a nurse who loves his girlfriend and tries desperately to impress her parents by any means which includes telling harmless little lies which are then covered up with bigger lies and elaborate cover-up schemes. The film's script was initially written with Jim Carrey {{in the role of}} Greg and contained much more physical comedy, something that Stiller did not think would be successful with himself playing the role. This resulted in deletion of some scenes but also in introduction of at least one unscripted scene that was completely improvised by Stiller. Roach cast Stiller only after it became clear that Carrey would not be taking on the role.|$|E
500|$|The courts' {{cautiously}} optimistic acceptance of Pepper, which included {{an attempt to}} include it in the House of Lords' Practice Directions, soon began to wane. Although the lower courts applied the decision and allowed the use of Hansard, and the Lords itself initially followed it in R v Warwickshire County Council, ex parte Johnson, several objections and limits were expressed in later obiter dicta and ratio decidendi. The first judicial complaints were voiced in 1997 by Lord Hoffmann in The Intolerable Wrestle with Words and Meanings, where he criticised the increased expense and drop in efficiency which it created. In {{a speech to the}} Chancery Bar Lord Millett calling the judgment [...] "a regrettable decision" [...] that [...] "was not only misguided in practical terms, it was <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>view</b> contrary to principle", saying that: [...] The courts immediately began to [...] "whittle down" [...] the precedent set by Pepper. The first direct attack came through Massey v Boulden, where the Court of Appeal held that Hansard could not be used in criminal law cases, because of [...] "the principle that penal statutes are to be narrowly construed intervenes to resolve any ambiguity without resort to Hansard".|$|E

60|$|I {{will not}} repeat {{my answer to}} Melissa, for I fear it was offensively brusque, my opinion being that Sir Gavial was the more pernicious scoundrel of the two, since his name for virtue served as an {{effective}} part of a swindling apparatus; and perhaps I hinted that to call such a man moral showed rather a silly notion of human affairs. In fact, I had an angry wish to be instructive, and Melissa, as will sometimes happen, noticed my anger without appropriating my instruction, for I have since heard that she speaks of me as rather violent-tempered, and not over strict <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>views</b> of morality.|$|R

500|$|In an {{interview}} with [...] FT Magazines Rosie Millard, Hedren discussed Hitchcock's attitude towards her after {{she decided not to}} work for him again: [...] "He did ruin my career. He kept me under contract, paid me to do nothing for close on two years." [...] Hitchcock sold her contract to Universal Studios, which dismissed her when she refused to work on one of its television shows. However, her acting career continued and she appeared in a number of film and television productions. Hedren said that while she was still under contract to Hitchcock, he turned down several film roles on her behalf, and was particularly disappointed when she heard from French director François Truffaut that he had wanted her for his film Fahrenheit 451. Truffaut's daughter Laura disputed this, telling Tony Lee Moral her mother had expressed surprise at the mention of Hedren's possible involvement in the project. Laura Truffaut was also sceptical of the story. [...] "It is extremely unlikely <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>view</b> that my father seriously entertained this project without sharing it with my mother as he was not secretive about the other actors who were considered for casting." ...|$|E
500|$|Craig Stanford, Professor of Biological Sciences and Anthropology at the University of Southern California, {{gave the}} book a {{generally}} positive review in American Scientist, but offered critique {{by suggesting that}} [...] "f there is a flaw in this tightly written, insightful book, it is that Wade provides perhaps {{too many of the}} stock examples of human evolution. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>view,</b> he spends too much time and space attempting to convince the reader that we did indeed evolve from apes (duh!) and that our own social behavior and cognition have roots in the deep human past." [...] Peter Dizikes of The New York Times also gave a mostly positive review, calling it a [...] "timely and informative survey." [...] However, he criticised Wade's claim that [...] "the development of lactose tolerance shows broadly that 'genes respond to cultural changes'", and posited the alternative view that it is [...] "a case of genes responding to an environmental change produced by society – the abundance of milk-producing cattle – and not to any abstract cultural practice." [...] Dizikes also took issue with Wade's use of the word [...] "race", saying that the [...] "judgment that these regional genetic tendencies constitute 'races' has no deep scientific rationale, either. Such labels are generalizations situated atop a complicated intermingling of populations." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the betting scandal, Stern revised the {{guidelines}} on the behavior of NBA referees during the Board of Governors' meeting in 2007. Despite the labor agreement for referees, which restricted them from participating in almost all forms of gambling, it was revealed that about half of the NBA's officials had made bets in casinos, albeit not with sportsbooks. In addition, almost all referees had admitted to engaging in some form of gambling. Stern stated that [...] " [...] ban on gambling is absolute, and <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>view</b> it is too absolute, too harsh and was not particularly well-enforced over the years". The gambling rules were revised to allow referees to engage in several forms of betting—though not on sports. There were several other referee-related rule changes made: the announcement of referees of a game was moved from 90 minutes before tip-off to the morning of the game, to reduce the value of the information to gamblers; referees received more in-season training and counseling [...] on gambling; more thorough background checks were carried out; the league declared its intention to analyze the statistical relationship between NBA games and referees' gambling patterns for those games; and the interactions between referees and NBA teams were made easier and more formal.|$|E
