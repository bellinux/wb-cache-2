5000|$|The {{front axle}} is rigid type, with <b>forged</b> <b>beam</b> and {{drop in the}} middle. The king pins are with slide bearing bushings. The axles were {{produced}} by Kirkstall. The suspension consists of 2Â½" [...] wide and 1 200 mm long half-elliptic leaf springs, with additional auxiliary springs on the rear axle, and telescopic hydraulic double-acting shock absorbers. The wheel size is 7.50 - 16".|$|E

5000|$|In 1969 Lukens Steel <b>forged</b> steel <b>beams</b> for the World Trade Center to be {{constructed}} in New York City. Some of these beams, known as [...] "trees", remained standing after the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks. Ten of the [...] "trees" [...] that remained were transported to Coatesville on April 15, 2010. They {{are to be}} used as a part of the proposed National Iron and Steel Heritage Museum.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{connecting rod}} <b>beam</b> (<b>forging</b> ID C9OE-A) featured drilled oil squirt bosses to lubricate the piston pin and cylinder bore and rectangular-head rod bolts mounted on broached shoulders. A number of fatigue failures {{were attributed to}} the machining of the part, so the bolt head area was spot-faced to retain metal in the critical area, requiring the use of 'football head' bolts. In 1975, the <b>beam</b> <b>forging</b> (D6OE-AA) was updated with more metal in the bolt-head area. The oil squirt bosses were drilled for use in export engines, where the quality of accessible lubricants was questionable. The rod cap forging remained the same on both units (part ID C9OE-A). In 1982, {{the design of the}} Essex V6 engine used {{a new version of the}} 351W connecting rod (E2AE-A), the difference between the two parts was that the V6 and V8 units were machined in metric and SAE units, respectively. The cap featured a longer boss for balancing than the original design.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>forged</b> {{front axle}} <b>beam</b> is I-profile shape {{and there is}} a drop in the middle. The axles are {{produced}} by Kirkstall. Suspension is carried out by leaf springs 1200 mm long and 2.5 in wide. Both front and rear axle are equipped with telescopic shock absorbers. The standard wheel size is 7.50 - 16" [...] and 5.50 - 20" [...] was available as an option.|$|R
50|$|The Opaekaa Road Bridge is a {{steel truss}} bridge {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places located along Opaekaa Road in the Wailua Homesteads {{neighborhood}} of Kapaa, {{on the island of}} Kauai, in the state of Hawaii, United States. The one-lane bridge spans Opaekaa Stream. With steel <b>beams</b> <b>forged</b> in 1890 by the Alexander Findlay & Company in Motherwell, Scotland, this is touted as possibly the only British-built bridge located in the United States.|$|R
50|$|While Picard {{and other}} Enterprise crew are visiting the fountain, a {{malfunction}} occurs, threatening to release massive doses of radiation. All but Picard and La <b>Forge</b> are <b>beamed</b> to the Enterprise before the radiation blocks any further attempts. Riker and Dr. Farallon arrange {{to have the}} Exocomps beamed into the facility to shield Picard and La Forge long enough to beam them out {{at the cost of}} destroying the Exocomps, but Data has locked out the transporter controllers, claiming the machines are sentient and refusing to allow them to be forced to die for others. After some negotiating, Data allows the Exocomps to be used but only if they are given the choice to go. The Exocomps show their intent to proceed, and are beamed to the fountain. The units configure themselves that not only allow Picard and La Forge to be rescued, but for {{all but one of the}} Exocomps to return to the Enterprise, the last one sacrificing itself for this purpose.|$|R
5000|$|Everything disappears once more, {{leaving only}} Riker and Ethan {{back in the}} cavern on Alpha Onias III. Riker is then able to contact the ship and learns that Worf and La <b>Forge</b> had <b>beamed</b> up without incident, but the Enterprise was unable to locate him. After Riker advises the captain that he will {{presently}} report back after learning more about his situation, Ethan confesses that he had created the simulations, using sophisticated scanners to read his mind and create the [...] "reality" [...] they experienced. Ethan's planet had been attacked and his people killed; his mother had hidden him in the cavern for his own safety, with all the simulation equipment, before she died; and Ethan, all alone, had been yearning for real companionship. Realizing Ethan's intentions were not hostile, Riker offers him refuge on the Enterprise. Ethan accepts Riker's offer and after Ethan reveals his true form as a grey-skinned insectoid alien named Barash, the two beam onto the ship.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{workshops}} much remains virtually unchanged since closure, with many items {{on display in}} the way of artifacts, and a leaflet to help identify them (although some items of equipment are so rare that the Visitors Guide admits that it has not been possible to identify them all). It is possible that the cast iron, fish-bellied rails {{on either side of the}} inspection pit form the oldest length of railway line in the world still in its original position. [...] Other items of particular interest, as indicated in the Visitors Guide, include a drill, chain bays, an old photograph, line tools, the <b>forge</b> and bellows, <b>beam</b> engine parts, a joiner's bench, and an oil tank.|$|R
