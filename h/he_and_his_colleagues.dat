5|$|In 1991, Kaspersky {{was granted}} an early release from his {{military}} service {{and left the}} defense ministry {{to take a job}} at the Information Technology Center of a private company KAMI, in order to work on his antivirus product full-time. There, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> improved the software and released it as a product called Antiviral Toolkit Pro in 1992. At first the software was purchased by about ten clients per month. It earned about $100 per month, mostly from companies in Ukraine and Russia. Kaspersky's then-future wife Natalya Kaspersky became his coworker at KAMI.|$|E
5|$|Arafat was {{detained}} in Syria's Mezzeh Prison when a Palestinian Syrian Army officer, Yusef Urabi, was killed. Urabi had been chairing {{a meeting to}} ease tensions between Arafat and Palestinian Liberation Front leader Ahmed Jibril, but neither Arafat nor Jibril attended, delegating representatives to attend on their behalf. Urabi was killed during or after the meeting amid disputed circumstances. On the orders of Defense Minister Hafez al-Assad, {{a close friend of}} Urabi, Arafat was subsequently arrested, found guilty by a three-man jury and sentenced to death. However, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> were pardoned by President Salah Jadid shortly after the verdict. The incident brought Assad and Arafat to unpleasant terms, which would surface later when Assad became President of Syria.|$|E

25|$|Mullis {{was awarded}} the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993 for his invention, seven years after <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> at Cetus first put his {{proposal}} to practice. However, some controversies have remained about the intellectual and practical contributions of other scientists to Mullis' work, and whether {{he had been the}} sole inventor of the PCR principle (see below).|$|E
25|$|It is of {{interest}} that autoradiographic studies by Leblond during this period also settled a controversy regarding the cellular site of synthesis of ribonucleic acid. Using radiolabeled cytidine in some forty cell types, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> {{were the first to}} demonstrate decisively that RNA is continuously synthesized in the nucleus and then migrates to the cytoplasm.|$|E

25|$|Isao Arita (born 1926) is a Japanese physician, {{virologist}} and vaccination {{specialist who}} headed the World Health Organization (WHO) Smallpox Eradication Unit in 1977–85. During this period, smallpox became the first infectious disease of humans to be eradicated globally.

He also advised the successful programme to eradicate poliovirus from the Western Pacific region.|$|E
25|$|During {{the winters}} of 1618 and 1622 he evangelized the Montagnais of Tadousac. He also taught them reading and writing. Back with the Hurons in 1623 {{he would have}} lost his life, but for the {{protection}} of a powerful Huron chief. In 1625, he was once more in France. He returned to Canada a year later, was again appointed Commissary for the friars in Quebec, and filled this office until the capture of Quebec by the English in 1629, when <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> were sent back to France by the conquerors. He arrived back in France on October 29, 1629.|$|E
25|$|In the Sierra de Ameca between Ahualulco de Mercado and Ameca, Jalisco, a {{large number}} of stone spheres, many of which are almost {{perfectly}} spherical, can be found. Their generally spherical shape led people to suspect they were manmade stone balls, called petrospheres, created by an unknown culture. In 1967, Stirling examined these stone spheres in the field. As a result of this examination, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> hypothesized that they were of geological origin. A later expedition and subsequent petrographic and other laboratory analyses of samples of the stone balls confirmed this suspicion. Their interpretation of the data collected in both field and laboratory is that these stone balls were formed by high temperature nucleation of glassy material within an ashfall tuff, as a result of tertiary volcanism.|$|E
50|$|In 1940, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleague</b> Harry Stack Sullivan, {{as members}} of the American Psychiatric Association's Committee on Military Mobilization, {{formulated}} guidelines for the psychological screening of inductees to the United States military.|$|R

25|$|Dr. Bellen’s current {{research}} focuses on an effort to decipher the mechanisms by which mutations in specific genes cause neurodegeneration, and to this end, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> performed unbiased forward genetic screens in fruitflies that detect the progressive decline in function and morphology of photoreceptor neurons. To date over 165 genes that cause a neurodegenerative phenotype when mutated have been uncovered by Dr. Bellen’s group using this strategy. Many of these genes encode homologues of human genes that are known to cause neurodegenerative diseases, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (Lou Gehrig's disease), Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Leigh syndrome, and others, and these studies will help provide a much {{better understanding of the}} molecular mechanisms by which neurodegeneration occurs. A prevailing theme among these mutants seems to be dysfunction of the neuronal mitochondria and an increasing inability to deal with oxidative stress, which manifests as lipid droplets.|$|E
25|$|Stouten (2006) further {{generalized}} {{the principle}} of fairness {{to be applied to}} the provision of public goods. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> ran three experiments to find how participants reacted when one member of their group violated the equality rule, which states that all group members will coordinate to equally and fairly contribute to the efficient provision of public goods. Their findings demonstrated that the participants believed that the equality rule should be applied to others and therefore when one person violated this rule punishment was used against this person, in terms of negative reactions. Therefore, the equality rule applied in real life situations should lead to the efficient provision of public goods if violations of the important coordination and fairness rules can be detected. However, often these violations cannot be detected which then leads to the free rider problem and an under-provision of public goods.|$|E
25|$|Tzigara's honors for 1912 {{included}} the Romanian Kingdom's Bene Merenti medal for services to culture. During {{much of that}} year, after some campaigning to obtain state funds, the art historian considered proposals for the Ethnography Museum's headquarters, also housed on Kiseleff. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> looked into international proposals, from Heino Schmieden, Louis Blanc and others, but eventually settled for a design proposed {{to them by the}} Romanian native Ghica-Budești. The Neo-Brâncovenesc features of the building, researchers note, where themselves an attempt to highlight the return to a peasant model. This formed part of a greater urban planning effort undertaken, with Carol I's approval and the involvement of Neo-Brâncovenesc architects, throughout northern and central Bucharest, with the erecting of many new public buildings: the Palace of Justice, the CEC Palace, the Geology Museum etc. (see History of Bucharest). Despite the approval, and the ceremonial placement of a foundation stone, construction was remarkably slow or under-financed, and Tzigara, who came to resent Ghica-Budești, did not live to see its completion.|$|E

25|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} he was {{involved}} in underground activity against the Shah's regime, calling for the 1954 Majlis elections to be free and fair and attempting to revive the nationalist movement. In 1960, the Second National Front was formed and Bakhtiar {{played a crucial role in}} the new organization's activities as the head of the student activist body of the Front. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> differed from most other government opponents in that they were very moderate, restricting their activity to peaceful protest and calling only for the restoration of democratic rights within the framework of a constitutional monarchy. The Shah refused to co-operate and outlawed the Front and imprisoned the most prominent liberals. From 1964 to 1977, the imperial regime refused to permit any form of opposition activity, even from moderate liberals like Bakhtiar. In the following years Bakhtiar was imprisoned repeatedly, a total of six years, for his opposition to the Shah. He was also one of the prominent members of central council of the illegal Fourth National Front in late 1977, when the group was reconstituted as the Union of National Front Forces with Bakhtiar as head of the Iran Party (the largest group in the Front).|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "We always prepare for the big one, we just didn't think it was going to come this soon." ...|$|E
500|$|Gandhi {{spoke out}} against {{untouchability}} early in his life. Before 1932, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> used the term Antyaja for untouchables. One of the major speeches he made on untouchability was at Nagpur in 1920, where he called untouchability as a great evil in Hindu society. In his remarks, he stated that the phenomena of untouchability {{is not unique to}} the Hindu society, but has deeper roots because Europeans in South Africa treat [...] "all of us, Hindus and Muslims, as untouchables; we may not reside in their midst, nor enjoy the rights which they do". He called it intolerable. He stated this practice can be eradicated, Hinduism is flexible to allow this, and a concerted effort is needed to persuade it is wrong and by all to eradicate it.|$|E
