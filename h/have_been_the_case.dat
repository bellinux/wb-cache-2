5|$|Royal {{artisans}} {{were sometimes}} responsible for sculpting stelae; {{in some cases}} these sculptors were actually the sons of kings. In other cases {{it is likely that}} captive artisans from defeated cities were put to work raising stelae for the victors, as evidenced by the sculptural style of one city appearing upon monuments of its conqueror soon after its defeat. This appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in Piedras Negras where Stela12 depicting war captives submitting to the victorious king is carved in the style of Pomoná, the defeated city. Archaeologists believe that this may also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Quiriguá after its surprise defeat of its overlord Copán.|$|E
5|$|The single reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on January 6, 1911. The film had a wide national release; advertising theaters are known in Indiana, North Carolina, South Dakota, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Texas. In Arizona, the film would be advertised by one theatre as Baseball Bloomers and it appears to also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in another Kansas theater. The film would also be shown in Hawaii in August 1912.|$|E
5|$|Any dive {{which is}} started while the tissues retain {{residual}} inert gas {{in excess of}} the surface equilibrium condition is considered a repetitive dive. This means that the decompression required for the dive is influenced by the divers decompression history. Allowance must be made for inert gas preloading of the tissues which will result in them containing more dissolved gas than would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> if the diver had fully equilibrated before the dive. The diver will need to decompress longer to eliminate this increased gas loading.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Jones {{brought a}} claim for damages for {{professional}} negligence against Kaney, {{on the basis that}} the personal injury claim had had to be settled for considerably less than would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> had Kaney not signed a document that apparently did not reflect her views. Kaney applied to strike out the claim before filing a defence, on the basis that the claim could not possibly succeed given the binding authority of the Court of Appeal decision of Stanton v Callaghan in 1998 that expert witnesses could not be sued for negligence when preparing a joint statement with the opposing side's expert witness.|$|E
5|$|The {{technologies}} of deep tube tunnelling and electric traction pioneered and proved by the C shaped {{the direction of}} subsequent underground railways built in London. The C demonstrated that an underground railway could be constructed without the need to purchase large and expensive tracts of land for the shallow cuttings of sub-surface steam operated railways. Instead, it became possible to construct a tunnel at deep level without adversely affecting conditions on the surface. The C thus encouraged {{the construction of a}} network of underground railways in London, far larger than might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> otherwise. The size and depth of the tunnels used on the deep tube lines, including the Northern line, does have drawbacks: the tunnels have a limited loading gauge and the lines suffer from overheating in the summer.|$|E
5|$|In August 1981 {{the program}} {{received}} a boost when British Aerospace (BAe) and McDonnell Douglas signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), marking the UK's re-entry into the program. The British government was enticed by the lower cost of acquiring Harriers promised {{by a large}} production run, {{and the fact that}} the US was shouldering the expense of development. Under the agreement BAe was relegated to the position of a subcontractor, instead of the full partner status that would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> had the UK not left the program. Consequently, the company received, in man-hours, 40 percent of the airframe work-share. Aircraft production took place at McDonnell Douglas' facilities in suburban St. Louis, Missouri, and manufacturing by BAe at its Kingston and Dunsfold facilities in Surrey, England. Meanwhile, 75 percent work-share for the engine went to Rolls-Royce, which had previously absorbed Bristol Siddeley, with the remaining 25 percent assigned to Pratt & Whitney. The two companies planned to manufacture 400 Harrier IIs, with the USMC expected to procure 336 aircraft and the RAF, 60.|$|E

5|$|Modern historians, {{including}} Ian Wood and Rob Meens, {{have seen}} the Libellus as indicating that Augustine had more contact with native British Christians than is indicated by Bede's narrative in the Historia Ecclesiastica. Augustine's original questions (no longer extant) would {{have been sent to}} Rome around 598, but Gregory's reply (i.e. the Libellus) was delayed some years due to illness, and was not composed until perhaps the summer of 601. The Libellus may have been brought back to Augustine by Laurence and Peter, along with letters to the king of Kent and his wife and other items for the mission. However, some scholars have suggested that the Libellus may in fact never have reached its intended recipient (Augustine) in Canterbury. Paul Meyvaert, for example, has noted that no early Anglo-Saxon copy of the Libellus survives that is earlier than Bede's Historia ecclesiastica (ca 731), and Bede's copy appears to derive not from a Canterbury file copy but rather from a Continental canon law collection. This would be strange had the letter arrived in Canterbury in the first place. A document as important to the fledgling mission and to the history of the Canterbury church as the Libellus is likely to have been protected and preserved quite carefully by Canterbury scribes; yet this seems not to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Meyvaert therefore suggested that the Libellus may have been waylaid on its journey north from Rome in 601, and only later arrived in England, long after Augustine's death. This hypothesis is supported by the surviving manuscript and textual evidence, which strongly suggests that the Libellus circulated widely on the Continent for perhaps nearly a century before finally arriving in England (see below). Still, the exact time, place, and vector by which the Libellus arrived in England and fell into the hands of Bede (and thence his Historia Ecclesiastica) is still far from certain, and scholars continue to explore these questions.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen {{species have}} been {{referred}} to the genus Psittacosaurus, although only nine to eleven are considered valid today. This is {{the highest number of}} valid species currently assigned to any single dinosaur genus (not including birds). In contrast, most other dinosaur genera are monospecific, containing only a single known species. The difference is most likely due to artifacts of the fossilisation process. While Psittacosaurus is known from hundreds of fossil specimens, most other dinosaur species are known from far fewer, and many are represented by only a single specimen. With a very high sample size, the diversity of Psittacosaurus can be analysed more completely than that of most dinosaur genera, resulting in the recognition of more species. Most extant animal genera are represented by multiple species, suggesting that this may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for extinct dinosaur genera as well, although most of these species may not have been preserved. In addition, most dinosaurs are known solely from bones and can only be evaluated from a morphological standpoint, whereas extant species often have very similar skeletal morphology but differ in other ways which would not normally be preserved in the fossil record, such as behaviour, or colouration. Therefore, actual species diversity may be much higher than currently recognised in this and other dinosaur genera. As some species are known only from skull material, species of Psittacosaurus are primarily distinguished by features of the skull and teeth. Several species can be recognised by features of the pelvis as well.|$|E
