However, during {{the worst part of}} the crisis, between 2008-2010, France fared better than other industrialized countries. For example, the Euro zone’s overall GDP decreased by 4 percent, while France’s GDP only decreased by 2.2 percent. This resilience is linked to France’s social protection system, which, through the transfers it organizes (47 percent of <b>gross</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>household</b> <b>income</b> in 2007) equips France with strong economic stabilizers. However, these stabilizers weigh inversely on recovery. Starting in 2012, many countries experienced economic recoveries, where the analysis of the indicators of economic activity in France do not show a clear recovery, or rather do not show an increased growth during this time.|$|E

An Annex to this article provides further information on definitions and methodology relating to GDHI. ...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARYThis quarter, the Regional Economic Indicators {{article focuses}} on <b>Gross</b> <b>Disposable</b> <b>Household</b> <b>Income</b> (GDHI) which is a key measure of {{economic}} welfare and of the prosperity of residents living in a region. This article analyses the dispersion in GDHI per head between UK regions and sub‐regions between 1995 and 2008. The regular part of the article then gives {{an overview of the}} economic activity of UK regions in terms of their Gross Value Added (GVA), GVA per head and labour productivity. This is followed by a presentation of headline indicators of regional welfare, other drivers of regional productivity and regional labour market statistics. The indicators cover the nine Government Office Regions of England and the devolved administrations of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. These 12 areas comprise level 1 of the European Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics (NUTS level 1 ) for the UK. The term ‘region’ is used to describe this level of geography for convenience in this article. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. During 1998, in line with other European Union (EU) member states, the UK adopted the new European System of Accounts (ESA 95), {{to be used by}} the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for the production of financial data. In September 1998 the UK National Accounts were published for the first time using ESA 95. Under this system, ONS is required to compile more detailed regional economic information than was previously the case and now produces regional Gross Value Added (GVA - formerly Gross Domestic Product or GDP, to which some series still refer), regional Household Accounts and regional Gross Fixed Capital Formation. Most Regional Accounts data are now consistent with ESA 95 - users should refer to the information in the 'Main Topics' section below, and the documentation. Regional Accounts data are compiled mainly from the UK National Accounts (Blue Book), the New Earnings Survey (NES) and the Annual Business Inquiry (ABI 2). For the 8 th edition (December 2002), data files covering Gross Value Added (GVA - formerly GDP) by GOR, Industry, Manufacturing Class and other tables were added to the dataset. On 10 th December 2002, however, ONS withdrew the 8 th edition GVA data files, due to errors discovered in the data. Main Topics : PART I: Regional Gross Value Added (GVA - formerly GDP) up to 1998 / 1999 - European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95) basis. Files: 1. GVA by Government Office Region (GOR) 1989 - 1999 : file gvagor 8999 (withdrawn - see 'Abstract' section for details). 2. GVA by industry 1989 - 1999 : file gvaind 8999 (withdrawn). 3.

Compensation of Employees (COE) by industry 1989 - 1998 : file indcomp 8998. 6. Compensation of Employees (COE) by manufacturing class 1989 - 1998 : file compcls 8998. Due to the withdrawal of GVA data, the following GDP data are also available, but users should bear in mind the age of these data when conducting analysis: 1. GDP by GOR 1989 - 1999 : file gpdgor 8999. 2. GDP by Industry 1989 - 1998 : file gdpind 8998. 3. GDP by Manufacturing Class 1989 - 1998 : file gpdmancls 8998.

An Autoregressive Distributed Lag and Granger causality techniques was used to analyse data collected from the South African Reserve Bank and Quantec from 1984 to 2014.

These observations are controlled for professional and individual characteristics. The data basis is constituted by the study entitled “Continuing in employment in pensionable age ” with N = 1, 500 dependent employees aged from 55 to under 65. Logistic regressions show that the socioeconomic status makes a statistically-signifi cant contribution towards explaining the willingness to continue in employment: In comparison to employees with a lower or medium professional status, those individuals who have a high professional status tended to be signifi-cantly more willing to remain in working life for longer. There is a negative connec-tion between the <b>disposable</b> <b>household</b> <b>income</b> and the willingness to remain in employment in retirement age.

A survey was undertaken to provide {{an indication of the}} determinants of electricity consumption in Perth Social Housing in Western Australia. The household survey provided a range of information about a number of building and occupant-related factors, including floor area, <b>household</b> size, <b>disposable</b> <b>household</b> <b>income,</b> occupancy hours, Head of Household (HoH) gender, presence of children in the households and occupants’ window opening behaviour that may influence the consumption in the dwellings. Outcomes of the research revealed that the floor area, <b>household</b> size, <b>disposable</b> <b>household</b> <b>income</b> and HoH gender are significant in explaining the variation in electricity consumption of the sample households. Other factors such as the presence of children in the household and window opening behaviour of the building users, however, did not precisely explain the changes in the households’ electricity usage.
