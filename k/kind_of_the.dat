25|$|Alternation {{of stress}} on a non-desinential {{syllable}} with desinential accentuation. If the accent is on a pre-desinential syllable, it carries the acute tone. Polysyllabic nouns are accented in a {{further than the}} pre-desinential syllable from the ending by any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stress. There are only a marginal number of polysyllabic nouns that have stress on a pre-desinential syllable. Place of a stress is in the ending in certain cases, resembling the fourth pattern. If the intonation is acute the word has a mark 3a, 34a, (35a, 36a) written by in dictionaries, and if a circumflex or short, the mark is 3b, 34b, (35b, 36b); the number three means the number of an accentuation pattern, the letter a means the acute intonation, the letter b is for a circumflex intonation or a short stress; if the accent is in a further than the third syllable from the ending the other digit is added, for instance, 34b means that the stress falls on the fourth from the ending syllable and (b) it is short or of circumflex intonation.|$|E

In the Government of Jovan Marinović, from November 1873 till December 1874 he was Minister of Finance for the second time and in that capacity he was instrumental in bringing important reforms. He introduced the metric system to Serbia. Serbia joined the Latin Monetary Union and he baptised the new domestic currency, the dinar, after mediaeval Serbian silver coins. He always considered his most important achievement in this government the law stipulating the amount of property that had to be left to peasants, and could not be confiscated to cover their debts. This minimal amount included peasant's house, a yoke of oxen, the plough, and five acres of land. He was elected for the third time as Minister of Finance in the Government of Danilo Stefanović (Stefanović) in 1875.|$|E

In ibn Khordadbeh's account, the Rus' are described as [...] "a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saqaliba", a term usually used to refer to Slavs, and anti-Normanist scholars have interpreted this passage as indicative of the Rus' being Slavs rather than Scandinavians. In the interpretation of the Normanist scholars, the word Saqaliba was also frequently applied to all fair-haired, ruddy-complexioned populations of Central, Eastern, and Northeastern Europe, so ibn Khordadbeh's language is ambiguous here.|$|E

This year, we focused on spatiotemporal features using multi-frame informations, and we used Multiple Kernel Learning as a fusion method to combine all these features {{in the same way}} as last year. Our submitted runs are as follows: • (Run 1) UEC MKL fusion <b>of</b> five <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> features including color, faces, motion features, Gabor textures and SURF-based spatio-temporal features, with Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL). • (Run 2) UEC AVG fusion <b>of</b> five <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same features as Run 1 with a standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a uniformly-combined kernel. In all the runs, we used <b>the</b> same five <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> features, spatio-temporal features, Gabor texture features, motion histograms, color histograms, and faces. Run 1 used Multiple Kernel Learning. Run 2 combined the five kernels uniformly each of which corresponds to one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> features, and applied a standard SVM.

500|$|The dragons {{featured}} in the episode's finale were implemented by Bluebolt, UK, the lead VFX agency for the first season. VFX supervisor Angela Barson confirmed that the CGI dragons {{were among the most}} stressful effects, prompting sleepless nights.

According to various published sources, Fox's absence from the film was due to Bay ultimately choosing not to renew her role in light of her comparing him and his work ethics to Adolf Hitler, although representatives for the actress said that it was her decision to leave the film franchise. Bay later claimed that Fox was fired by executive producer Steven Spielberg, a claim which Spielberg denied. [...] "I wasn't hurt", Bay stated, [...] "because I know that's just Megan.

500|$|Similar to the films, Max seldom speaks or expresses emotion; his {{thoughts}} are reflected by his actions. The team aimed at developing a complex character and personality for him.

These qualities {{are reflected in}} the game's [...] "rage" [...] mode, in which Max inflicts additional damage on enemies. Chumbucket, Max's mechanic and companion, is obsessed with the Magnum Opus; according to the game's lead writer, he [...] "has a pseudo-religious/sexual relationship with engines". Scabrous Scrotus, the game's main antagonist, is a warlord designed as a [...] "bloodthirsty monster that only can find solace from his own pain through the suffering of others".
