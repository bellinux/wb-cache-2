Despite having an arranged marriage, Periyar and Nagammai were already in love with each other. Nagammai actively supported her husband in his later public activities and agitations. Two years after their marriage, a daughter was born to them. However, their daughter {{died when she was}} five months old. The couple <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> children.|$|E
5|$|Although the Wehrmacht's {{offensive}} {{had been}} stopped, German intelligence estimated that Soviet forces <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> reserves left and thus {{would be unable}} to stage a counteroffensive. This estimate proved wrong, as Stalin transferred over 18 divisions, 1,700 tanks, and over 1,500 aircraft from Siberia and the Far East. The Red Army had accumulated a 58-division reserve by early December, when the offensive proposed by Zhukov and Vasilevsky was finally approved by Stalin. Even with these new reserves, Soviet forces committed to the operation numbered only 1,100,000 men, only slightly outnumbering the Wehrmacht. Nevertheless, with careful troop deployment, a ratio of two-to-one was reached at some critical points.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{ordered his}} field {{officers}} {{to inspect the}} troops and to report back with the condition of his troops.

Ammunition in the camp was also dwindling; each man <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than ten cartridges apiece. With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman's troops at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon, there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in the near future.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1986 election, the Centre Democrats {{worked on}} {{improving}} both its image and its grassroots support.

By contesting the election in all nineteen constituencies, the party won the right to state-sponsored television and radio time but still <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than 300 registered members. In the 1990 local elections the Centre Democrats won eleven seats, then, in the 1991 provincial elections, three seats in the provincial parliament.|$|E

Diane never regarded Catherine as a threat. She even encouraged the king {{to spend more time with}} Catherine and sire more children. In 1556, Catherine nearly died giving birth to twin daughters, Joan and Victoria. Surgeons saved her life by breaking the legs of Joan, who died in her womb. The surviving daughter, Victoria, died seven weeks later. Catherine <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> children.|$|E
5|$|This {{marked the}} end of Smith's front-line {{political}} career—Gerald Smith (no relation) replaced him as leader of the CAZ—but he remained active in opposition at a reduced level. In July 1992 he chaired a meeting where the CAZ, Muzorewa's UANC, Sithole's ZANU–Ndonga party and Edgar Tekere's Zimbabwe Unity Movement formed a coalition to challenge Mugabe and ZANU–PF in the next parliamentary election. The result was the short-lived United Front, which Smith agreed to chair, saying he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> political ambitions and could therefore be regarded as a neutral figurehead. The United Front quickly failed, largely {{due to the lack of}} common ground between the constituent parties, and never contested an election. Another brief collaboration between Smith, Muzorewa and Sithole in March 2000 also led to nothing.|$|E

5|$|As McKinley's {{professional}} career progressed, so too did his social life blossom as he wooed Ida Saxton, {{the daughter of}} a prominent Canton family. They were married on January 25, 1871, in the newly built First Presbyterian Church of Canton, although Ida soon joined her husband's Methodist church. Their first child, Katherine, was born on Christmas Day 1871. A second daughter, Ida, followed in 1873, but died the same year. McKinley's wife descended into a deep depression at her baby's death and her health, never robust, grew worse. Two years later, in 1875, Katherine died of typhoid fever. Ida never recovered from her daughters' deaths; the McKinleys <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> children. Ida McKinley developed epilepsy around the same time and thereafter disliked her husband's leaving her side. He remained a devoted husband and tended to his wife's medical and emotional needs {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|However, once {{he learned}} that a betrothal had finally been arranged, the Emperor ended his {{relationship}} to Domitila. She returned to her native province of São Paulo on 27 August, where she remained. Days earlier, on 2 August, the Emperor had been married by proxy to Amélie of Leuchtenberg. He was stunned by her beauty after meeting her in person. The vows previously made by proxy were ratified in a Nuptial Mass on 17 October. Amélie was kind and loving to his children and provided a much needed sense of normality to both his family and the general public. After Domitila's banishment from court, the vow the Emperor made to alter his behavior proved to be sincere. He <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> affairs and remained faithful to his spouse. In an attempt to mitigate and move beyond other past misdeeds, he made peace with José Bonifácio, his former minister and mentor.|$|E

5|$|James made a {{surprise}} return to TNA {{as a fan}} favorite, {{after a year and}} a half absence from the company, on January 30, 2015, during the tapings of Impact Wrestling in Glasgow, Scotland. James would then have several confrontations with Bram over his actions towards her real life fiancé, Magnus. On the April 24 episode of Impact Wrestling, James retired from wrestling to focus on becoming a full-time mother, but James Storm talked her into having one more match. On the June 3 episode of Impact Wrestling, James declined an offer by Storm to join The Revolution, which resulted in him intentionally shoving her onto a train track in the storyline, which sparked controversy. This was done to write off James from television, as she <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> dates set with the company at the time. James made her return on the July 1 episode of Impact Wrestling, confronting Storm and challenging him to a mixed tag team match. On the July 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, James and Magnus defeated Storm and his partner Serena, when James pinned Serena.|$|E
5|$|Many European {{countries}} have professional leagues as well, the most successful, {{other than the}} Dutch league, being the Italian league founded in 1948. Compared to those in Asia and Latin America, the various European leagues and the one in Australia historically have <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than niche appeal. In 2004, Australia won a surprise silver medal at the Olympic Games. The Israel Baseball League, launched in 2007, folded after one season. The Confédération Européene de Baseball (European Baseball Confederation), founded in 1953, organizes a number of competitions between clubs from different countries, as well as national squads. Other competitions between national teams, such as the Baseball World Cup and the Olympic baseball tournament, were administered by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) from its formation in 1938 until its 2013 merger with the International Softball Federation to create the current joint governing body for both sports, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC). By 2009, the IBAF had 117 member countries. Women's baseball is played on an organized amateur basis {{in many of the}} countries where it is a leading men's sport. Since 2004, the IBAF and now WBSC have sanctioned the Women's Baseball World Cup, featuring national teams.|$|E
5|$|Nansouty's {{division}} {{suffered a}} very high casualty rate at the Battle of Wagram, with more men and horses lost {{than the other two}} heavy cavalry divisions combined. Losses in horses were extremely high, with 1,141 animals killed or injured, while losses in men were also significant, despite the fact that only the carabiniers-à-cheval really came into contact with the enemy. Overall, Nansouty's division lost 164 men killed and 436 wounded. Foremost of all, the highly battered two carabiniers-à-cheval regiments <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than 300 horses standing between themselves {{by the end of the}} day, for an equine casualty rate of 77 percent, with the 9th and 12th cuirassiers also suffering high casualties. Bessières's charge, hastily organised with only the division of Nansouty, through murderous artillery fire and against masses of infantry prepared to receive them, had less tactical effect than at Aspern-Essling, but it did win Napoleon valuable time, allowing him to retake the initiative in this battle.|$|E

5|$|The {{first few}} plays {{of the fourth}} quarter {{failed to live up}} to the promise that had been shown in the third for the Hokies. Two {{incomplete}} passes and one that gained just twoyards forced Virginia Tech to punt the ball away with 13:49 remaining in the quarter. After taking over at its 33-yard line, Kansas <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> success on offense than did Virginia Tech. After three straight plays with no gain, Kansas was forced to punt the ball away as well. A 58-yard kick by Kyle Tucker pinned Virginia Tech inside its 10-yard line, and the Hokies were unable to advance the ball much beyond the ten-yard line. An incomplete pass and a two-yard run by Branden Ore were all the offense managed before Sean Glennon threw a 20-yard interception to the Jayhawks' Justin Thornton. Thornton returned the ball 30yards to the Virginia Tech two-yard line, and on Kansas' first play after the interception, Todd Reesing ran twoyards for the touchdown. The score gave the Jayhawks a 2414 lead with just 10:57 remaining.|$|E
5|$|The losses {{suffered}} {{by both the}} Egyptians and the Israelis in the battle were severe. Israeli units suffered heavy casualties in men and equipment; Reshef's armored losses during {{the first night of}} the battle alone were comparable to Egyptian armored losses on the disastrous October 14 offensive. For their part, the numbers of Egyptian armored forces within 16th Division's bridgehead severely dwindled. As of 18 October the 21st Armored Division <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than 40 tanks remaining of an original 136 tanks available {{at the start of the}} battle (not counting 21 tanks received as reinforcements), while the 16th Infantry Division had just 20 tanks remaining in its organic tank battalion. This attrition served Egypt's war strategy of inflicting maximum casualties on the Israelis, even though, from another perspective, the initiative had passed to the Israelis during the battle.|$|E
5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} or seizures {{are typically}} denied a pilot license. In Canada {{if an individual}} has <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> than one seizure, they may be considered after five years for a limited license if all other testing is normal. Those with febrile seizures and drug related seizures may also be considered. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration does not allow those with epilepsy to get a commercial pilot license. Rarely, exceptions {{can be made for}} persons who have had an isolated seizure or febrile seizures and have remained free of seizures into adulthood without medication. In the United Kingdom, a full national private pilot license requires the same standards as a professional driver's license. This requires a period of ten years without seizures while off medications. Those who do not meet this requirement may acquire a restricted license if free from seizures for five years.|$|E

He was quizzed by North Carolina's Claude Kitchin, who asked whether there had been a unanimous recommendation by the committee, whether McAdoo and Baker had approved the bill, and whether there was precedent for a half dollar in honor of a state's centennial (there was not). Wheeler reassured Kitchin as to the unanimity of the committee, and the approval by the officials, but did not answer the centennial question definitively, instead citing instances of prior commemorative issues (the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar and the Panama-Pacific commemorative coins). Ashbrook intervened, assuring Kitchin that his committee had unanimously approved it. Kitchin <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> questions, and the House approved the bill without a recorded vote.|$|E
5|$|On January 16, 1909, Democrat Hiram Smedley, county clerk since 1897, {{was indicted}} for embezzlement. Smedley resigned, and Barkley was {{appointed}} to a three-man commission to investigate the losses. The commission found $1,582.50 missing, and the county's Fiscal Court authorized Barkley to settle with the company that held Smedley's surety bond. In May 1909, Smedley {{was arrested and charged}} with 20 counts of forgery, prompting an audit of the county's finances that showed a shortage of $16,000, only $6,000 of which was accountable to Smedley. The scandal gave Republicans an issue for the upcoming campaign. In a series of debates, Barkley's opponent, Thomas N. Hazelip, claimed that the county's entire Democratic organization was corrupt and made charges against past Democratic administrations. Barkley responded that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> responsibility for those wrongdoings than Hazelip had for the murder of William Goebel, a Democratic governor who had allegedly been assassinated by Republican conspirators in 1900. He pointed to his improvement of the county's finances through inspection of charges presented to his office and showed evidence that he had fulfilled his obligations as county attorney, a fact Hazelip conceded. In spite of the scandal, Democrats won every county-wide office, although by reduced margins, but Republicans captured a 5-to-3 majority on the Fiscal Court. Barkley's victory margin—3,184 to 2,662—was the smallest of any county officer.|$|E
