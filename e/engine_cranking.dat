50|$|An {{alternative}} to jumper cables is a cable used to interconnect the 12 volt power outlets (cigarette lighter outlets) of two vehicles. While this eliminates concerns with incorrect connections and generation of arcs near battery terminals, {{the amount of}} current available through such a connection is small. This method works by slowly recharging the battery, not by providing the current needed for cranking. The <b>engine</b> <b>cranking</b> motor current draw will exceed the fuse rating in a cigarette lighter outlet. Many vehicles turn off the cigarette lighter outlets when the key is turned off, making the technique unusable unless the ignition key is turned to the accessory or on position to connect the cigarette lighter outlet to the battery.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, the Tech IV engine {{has proved}} to be a {{reliable}} workhorse for owners when not pushed to its limits. All 1978-1990 Iron Duke L-4's are outfitted with a micarta camshaft gear that meshes directly with a steel gear on the crankshaft (no timing chain), a design also used by the Chevrolet inline six. 1991-92 VIN R and U engines received a timing chain. The timing gear has a tendency to crumble a tooth anytime after 80,000 miles. The cam gear simply shears a tooth at startup and the engine won't start; because of the non-interference design of the engine, no further damage occurs. When the cam gear loses a tooth, the camshaft AND distributor stop rotating during <b>engine</b> <b>cranking.</b> Replacing the gear requires heating the new gear in hot oil and quickly installing it for a shrink(interference) fit on the cam stub. One upgrade is the use of the aluminum camshaft timing gear from a Chevrolet 250 inline six with the Iron Duke's crankshaft timing gear.|$|E

Similar to the studies in [6, 7], the diesel <b>engine</b> <b>cranking</b> dynamics are avoided. To avoid the unnecessary diesel <b>engine</b> <b>cranking</b> dynamics, the engine rest state is simulated at a speed of 0.3 p.u. Thus, although the engine is considered stopped, the simulated value would remain at 0.3 p.u. Since the cranking delay will affect the readiness of the DG to provide frequency regulation, a 0.5  s delay is added as cranking time to the DG model [6, 7]. Thus, the diesel engine start will be delayed by 0.5  s when the speed increases from 0.3 p.u.|$|E
40|$|In modern {{heavy duty}} trucks the battery {{is a central}} component. Its {{traditional}} role as an energy source for <b>engine</b> <b>cranking</b> has been extended to include powering a number of elec- trical components on the truck, both during driving and during standstill. As a consequence of this {{it is important to}} know how much a battery in use has aged and lost in terms of ca- pacity and power output. The difficulty in measuring these factors on a battery in use causes problem, since heavy duty truck batteries are often replaced too early or too late, leading to unnecessary high replacement costs or truck standstill respectively. The overall goal of the effort, of which this thesis is a part, is to use a model of the cranking behaviour of a heavy duty truck engine, which depends on the battery condition, to estimate the ageing and wear of a heavy duty truck battery. This thesis proposes a modelling approach to model the components involved in <b>engine</b> <b>cranking.</b> In the thesis work, system identification is made of the systems forming part of the cranking of a heavy duty truck engine. These components are the starter battery, the starter motor and its electrical circuit and the internal combustion engine. Measurement data has been provided by Scania AB for the evaluation of the models. The data has been collected from crankings of a heavy duty diesel engine at different temperatures and battery charge levels. For every cranking lapse the battery voltage and current have been measured as well as the engine rotational speed. A starter battery model is developed and evaluated. The resulting battery model is then incorporated into two different <b>engine</b> <b>cranking</b> models, Model 1 and Model 2, including a starter motor model and an internal combustion engine model apart form the battery model. The two cranking models differ in several aspects and their differences and resulting evalu- ations are discussed. The battery model is concluded to be sufficiently accurate during model verification, however the two cranking models are not. Model 2 is verified as more correct in in its output than Model 1, but neither is sufficiently accurate for their purpose. The conclusion is drawn that the modelling approach is sound but development of Model 2 is needed before the model can be used in model-based condition estimation. ...|$|E

To utilize this concept, especially for construction machines, the engine is desired to be started {{in such a way}} that the operator discomfort can be minimized. To address this issue, this paper aims to develop a simple powertrain modelling approach for engine stop-start dynamic analysis and an advanced engine start control scheme newly applicable for micro/mild hybrid construction machines. First, a powertrain model of a generic construction machine is mathematically developed in a general form which allows to investigate the transient responses of the system during the <b>engine</b> <b>cranking</b> process.

Finally, the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed modelling and control approaches have been validated through numerical simulations.

The proposed {{model can be}} used in motor control strategies for the winding temperature prediction during transient overload or viceversa, for the prediction of the maximum time duration of the overload maintaining the winding temperature within the limit imposed by the class of insulation. The thermal model has been validated using two different electrical machines.

The entire transient phase, starting from the <b>engine</b> <b>cranking</b> until the catalyst warm-up is completed, was taken into account in the simulation, and the model was validated using a wide data-set of experimental tests. The first step of the modeling activity was the combustion analysis during the transient phase: the burn rate was evaluated on the basis of experimental in-cylinder pressure data, considering both cycle-to-cycle and cylinder-to-cylinder variations. Then, as far as the exhaust temperatures are concerned, a detailed model of the thermocouples was implemented to replicate the physical behavior of the sensors during the warm-up and to compare the simulated temperatures with the measured ones. Finally, a complete analysis of the energy balance during the transient was carried out: the thermal power available to the catalyst inlet was obtained from a complete analysis of power losses (i. e. friction and pumping losses, in-cylinder heat transfer, engine block and engine coolant heating, exhaust manifold heat transfer, etc.). In conclusion, the proposed methodology allows to reliably simulate in details the Cat-Heating transient, showing a valuable potential in driving the main design and calibration choices during the engine development process...|$|E
