40|$|Electromagnetic {{thrusters}} typically use {{electric and}} magnetic fields to accelerate and exhaust plasma through {{interactions with the}} charged particles in the plasma. The energy required to create the plasma, i. e. ionization energy, is potential energy between the electron and ion. This potential energy is typically lost since it is not recovered as the plasma is exhausted and is known as <b>frozen</b> <b>flow</b> loss. If the <b>frozen</b> <b>flow</b> energy is {{a small fraction of}} the total plasma energy, this <b>frozen</b> <b>flow</b> loss may be negligible. However, if the <b>frozen</b> <b>flow</b> energy is a major fraction of the total plasma energy, this loss can severely reduce the energy efficiency of the thruster. Recovery and utilization of this <b>frozen</b> <b>flow</b> energy can improve the energy efficiency of a thruster during low specific impulse operating regimes when the ionization energy is a large fraction of the total plasma energy. This paper quantifies the recovery of the <b>frozen</b> <b>flow</b> energy, i. e. recombination energy, via the process of surface recombination for helium. To accomplish this task the momentum flux and heat flux of the plasma flow were measured and compared to calculated values from electrostatic probe data. This information was used to deduce the contribution of recombination energy to the total heat flux on a flat plate as well as to characterize the plasma conditions. Helium propellant was investigated initially due to its high ionization potential and hence available recombination energy...|$|E

Different operating conditions of the Hyshot scramjet nozzle were simulated and analyzed.

The real non-equilibrium flow simulation result is between those of the two limiting cases: <b>frozen</b> <b>flow</b> and equilibrium flow, and is closer to that of <b>frozen</b> <b>flow.</b> With complete combustion condition at nozzle inlet, the radical recombination reaction releases tremendous amount of heat and this heat is mainly used to increases gas temperature and has only slight increasing effect on thrust.

40|$|Surf is {{a program}} for {{computing}} steady and inviscid, supersonic reacting flows in planar and axisymmetric nozzles.

Further, the possibility of switching the computation from a fully equilibrium to a fully nonequilibrium flow calculation was introduced. This latter option aims at decreasing the CPU-time by reducing the stiffness inherent to the partial differential equation system used for modeling the flow.

A shock triple point is used to generate a free shear layer in a model problem which also occurs in several aerodynamic applications such as shock-boundary layer interaction. Calculations were performed using a state-resolved, three-dimensional forced harmonic oscillator thermochemical model. An extension of an existing molecular-molecular energy transfer rate model to higher collisional energies is presented and verified. Nonequilibrium model results are compared with calculations assuming equilibrium and <b>frozen</b> <b>flows</b> over a range of (frozen) convective Mach numbers from 0. 341 to 1. 707.

40|$|During the {{evolution}} of density inhomogeneties in an Ω = 1, matter dominated universe, the typical density contrast changes from δ ≃ 10 − 4 to δ ≃ 10 2. However, during the same time, the typical value of the gravitational potential generated by the perturbations changes only {{by a factor of}} order unity. This significant fact can be exploited to provide a new, powerful, approximation scheme for studying the formation of nonlinear structures in the universe. This scheme, discussed in this paper, evolves the initial perturbation using a Newtonian gravitational potential frozen in time. We carry out this procedure for different intial spectra and compare the results with the Zeldovich approximation and the <b>frozen</b> <b>flow</b> approximation (proposed by Mattarrese et al. recently). Our results are in far better agreement with the N-body simulations than the Zeldovich approximation.

Usually, ice climbing refers to roped and protected climbing of features such as icefalls, frozen waterfalls, and cliffs and rock slabs covered with ice refrozen from flows of water.

Alpine ice is found in a mountain environment, usually requires an approach to reach, and is often climbed {{in an attempt to}} summit a mountain. Water ice is usually found on a cliff or other outcropping beneath water flows. Alpine ice is frozen precipitation whereas water ice is a <b>frozen</b> liquid <b>flow</b> of water. Most alpine ice is generally one component of a longer route and often less technical, having more in common with standard glacier travel, while water ice is selected largely for its technical challenge. Technical grade is, however, independent of ice type and both types of ice vary greatly in consistency according to weather conditions. Ice can be soft, hard, brittle or tough. Mixed climbing is ascent involving both ice climbing and rock climbing.|$|R
