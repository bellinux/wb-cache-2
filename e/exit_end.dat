2500|$|The {{blood flow}} through the bird lung is {{at right angles to}} the flow of air through the parabronchi, forming a cross-current flow {{exchange}} system (Fig.19). The partial pressure of oxygen in the parabronchi declines along their lengths as O2 diffuses into the blood. The blood capillaries leaving the exchanger near the entrance of airflow take up more O2 than do the capillaries leaving near the <b>exit</b> <b>end</b> of the parabronchi. [...] When the contents of all capillaries mix, the final partial pressure of oxygen of the mixed pulmonary venous blood is higher than that of the exhaled air, but is nevertheless less than half that of the inhaled air, thus achieving roughly the same systemic arterial blood partial pressure of oxygen as mammals do with their bellows-type lungs.|$|E

50|$|Decorative {{fountain}} systems employ fluid amplifiers {{to generate}} their decorative displays and effects. Fluid amplifiers {{rely on a}} fluid control stream to switch a fluid power stream. Fluid amplifiers are so named because a low-energy fluid control signal can control and switch a high-energy fluid power stream to produce an output signal of higher energy level than the fluid control signal. In fluid amplifiers, a fluid power stream, after leaving a nozzle, is switched selectively {{to one or more}} of a plurality of outlet passages. This may be done by supplying fluid control pressure continuously, or as a pulse, to one of the control ports at the <b>exit</b> <b>end</b> of the nozzle until the high-energy power stream is diverted. Alternatively, switching may be effected by closing the other control port so that the fluid that is flowing in through one control port from the atmosphere or some other source will create a sufficient fluid pressure imbalance adjacent the <b>exit</b> <b>end</b> of the nozzle to effect switching of the fluid power stream.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>exit</b> <b>end</b> of a choke {{is smaller}} by some {{dimension}} {{than the actual}} bore of the barrel. This difference in diameter {{is the amount of}} constriction. For example, for a 12 gauge, the bore diameter of the barrel is nominally 0.729 inches (1.85 cm), although different manufacturers do vary their as-manufactured bore from this diameter slightly. This is commonly called [...] "overbore", when the as-built diameter exceeds the nominal actual diameter of 0.729 inches (1.85 cm). The advantages touted for [...] "overbore" [...] are a perceived reduction in recoil, and a lessened shot deformation for improving shot patterns.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanical}} IQF freezers work on {{the principle}} of cold air circulation which is pushed from underneath the bed plate/transportation belt with the help of fans. The cold airflow keeps passing through the pieces of product in circular motions while the product is also advancing through the freezer towards the <b>exit</b> <b>end.</b> The design and efficiency of this type of IQF freezers varies among manufacturers who are trying to find the perfect balance of aerodynamics for an optimal freezing result.
