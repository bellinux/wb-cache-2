5|$|It was too <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> anything, so {{we carried}} our tent and baggage near the only {{house on the}} island, and began to cook our suppers, {{in order to be}} {{prepared}} for the earliest dawn, and to enjoy that which, from the conversation of the gentlemen we had, now raised the highest expectations of.|$|E

25|$|The Lobster Smack Inn {{saw many}} bare-knuckle fights in the 1850s, but few as {{dramatic}} as that between Tom 'the Brighton Boy' Sayers (1826–65) and Aaron Jones on 6 January 1857. The fight lasted for three hours and 65 rounds, and was finally declared a draw when it became too <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Sayers won at the rematch a month later in London.|$|E

60|$|Rho. Argaleon's father {{helped him}} to the crown: besides, he gilds over all his vices to the king, and, {{standing}} in the <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> him, <b>sees</b> all his inclinations, interests, and humours, which he so times and soothes, that, in effect, he reigns.|$|R
2500|$|The {{temple was}} panchoratno, at its front Natamandir and around it {{there is a}} row of rooms and a big pond and nahobottola gate through which {{elephant}} used to go. At its east there are tombs of some saints who used to pray or meditate at the temple. Outside the temple there are 5–6 pagoda with a shiblinga. The priest of Dhakeshawri temple used pray every day. [...] The deity is doshvuja. It is believed that it is made of gold. At {{the left and right}} side of the deity there are some other murti. Like the ancient temples its inside is <b>dark.</b> <b>To</b> <b>see</b> the deity light is to be arranged. The temple is owned by many because it is bought by the new caretaker from the old caretakers. Jotindramohan bought it in 1901. Dhakeshawri is crowded but it is an abode of peace. The low sound of the tongue mixes with the evening light and tune of temple bell and make the peaceful environment a happy event.|$|E
2500|$|Upon hearing {{their first}} hit single at age14, {{he became a}} great fan of The Beatles. He credits the band's 1963 song [...] "She Loves You" [...] for inspiring {{him to become a}} musician. He said in the 2011 {{documentary}} God Bless Ozzy Osbourne that [...] "as soon as [...] heard 'She Loves You' on the radio, [...] knew [...] wanted to be a rock star for the rest of [...] life". Osbourne left school at 15 and was employed as a construction site labourer, trainee plumber, apprentice toolmaker, car factory horn-tuner, and abattoir worker. He attempted to commit burglary, stealing a television (which fell on him during his getaway and had to be abandoned), a handful of baby clothes (originally thought to be adult clothes as it was too <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> when he committed the burglary, and which were stolen to sell to people at a pub), and some T-shirts. He spent six weeks in Winson Green Prison when he was unable to pay a fine after being found guilty of robbing a clothes shop; to teach his son a lesson, his father refused to pay the fine.|$|E
2500|$|After a British mine {{attack on}} 15 May, a German {{destructive}} bombardment {{on the ridge}} defences was accompanied by artillery registration (adjustments of aim by trial and error, directed by an observer in the air or on the ground) on the British communication trenches. In the five weeks before 21 May, the 25th Division (Major-General Beauchamp Doran) suffered [...] although the British miners were gradually gained an advantage over their German counterparts. The infantry thought that the Germans were going to attack but air reconnaissance found no signs of preparations. In the weeks before the German attack, the weather {{was so bad that}} reconnaissance flights over the ridge by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) over the ridge had been possible on only ten days. Aircraft observers saw several new light railways, a supply dump; at one place new assembly trenches were observed. The last reconnaissance before the German attack was flown on 17 May; the crew flew over the German trenches from [...] but found that it was too <b>dark</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> into them. British military intelligence took the view that the Germans lacked the infantry and artillery necessary for an attack and the transfer of divisions from the First, Second and Third armies to reinforce the Fourth Army continued.|$|E

50|$|Like all {{northern}} {{communities in}} Canada, Churchill can sometimes see the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) {{when there is}} a high amount of solar activity.

60|$|Then we {{marched on}} {{and came to}} another smaller patio where the females were.

60|$|As I took {{a parting}} look at First Witch in turning away, the red marks round her {{eyes seemed to}} have already grown larger, and she hungrily and thirstily looked out beyond me into the <b>dark</b> doorway, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if Jack was there.
