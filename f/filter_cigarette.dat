5000|$|The 1950s {{gave birth}} to {{numerous}} scientific studies that proved the link between cigarettes and cancer (see Wynder and Graham, 1950; Doll and Hill, 1952, 1954; Hammond and Horn, 1958). In response to these studies and their perceived threat to the tobacco industry's future profitability, tobacco companies experimented with new modifications to the cigarette design. By altering the cigarette design, tobacco companies hoped to create a [...] "safer" [...] cigarette that would better appeal to their increasingly health-conscious consumers. The addition of filters {{was one of the}} industry's first design modifications, and filters would become essential to the later development of light and low-tar products. Claiming that <b>filtered</b> <b>cigarettes</b> literally [...] "filtered out" [...] much of the harmful tar and carcinogenic particles found in regular cigarettes, tobacco companies promoted [...] "relative product safety" [...] in order to convince smokers to continue smoking. Because <b>filtered</b> <b>cigarettes</b> were depicted as relatively safer and less harmful, smokers who were concerned about tobacco's negative health impacts were led to believe that by switching to <b>filtered</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> they would minimize smoking's detrimental impact on their health. As a result, millions of smokers switched to <b>filtered</b> <b>cigarettes</b> instead of quitting altogether. By 1960, <b>filtered</b> <b>cigarettes</b> had become the leading tobacco product.|$|R

5000|$|From 1935, a British {{company began}} to develop a machine that made {{cigarettes}} incorporating the tipped filter.

Since <b>filtered</b> <b>cigarettes</b> were considered [...] "safer", by the 1960s, they dominated the market. Production of <b>filter</b> <b>cigarettes</b> rose from 0.5 percent in 1950 to 87.7 percent by 1975.|$|R
2500|$|After {{scientists}} {{published a}} major study linking smoking to lung {{cancer in the}} 1950s, Philip Morris repositioned Marlboro as a men's cigarette in order to fit a market niche of men who were concerned about lung cancer.

50|$|In the 2006 International Coastal Cleanup, {{cigarettes}} and cigarette butts constituted 24.7% {{of the total}} collected pieces of garbage, over {{twice as many as}} any other category, which is not surprising seeing the numbers in the table above of waste produced each year.Cigarette filters contain the chemicals <b>filtered</b> from <b>cigarettes</b> and can leach into waterways and water supplies.

After a cigarette is smoked, the filter retains some of the chemicals, and some of which are considered carcinogenic. When studying the environmental impact of <b>cigarette</b> <b>filters,</b> the various chemicals that can be found in <b>cigarette</b> <b>filters</b> are not studied individually, due to its complexity. Researchers instead focus on the whole <b>cigarette</b> <b>filter</b> and its LD50. LD50 is defined as the lethal dose that kills 50% of a sample population.

50|$|The {{repositioning}} of Marlboro as a men's cigarette {{was handled}} by Chicago advertiser Leo Burnett. Most <b>filtered</b> <b>cigarette</b> advertising {{sought to make}} claims about the technology behind the filter: {{through the use of}} complex terminology and scientific claims regarding the <b>filter,</b> the <b>cigarette</b> industry wanted to ease fears about the harmful effects of cigarette smoking through risk reduction. However, Leo Burnett decided to address the growing fears through an entirely different approach: creating ads completely void of health concerns or health claims of the <b>filtered</b> <b>cigarette.</b> Burnett felt that making claims about the effectiveness of filters furthered concerns of the long-term effects of smoking. Thus, refusing to respond to health claims matched the emergent, masculine image of the New Marlboro.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Examination {{of tobacco}} butts and its {{possible}} use in tobacco control. DESIGN: Macroscopic examination of cigarette butts collected outside or in dedicated smoking rooms of a smoke-free hospital. RESULTS: Of 925 butts, 3. 8 % were cigarillos, 11. 1 % <b>cigarettes</b> without <b>filter,</b> 57. 7 % ventilated <b>filter</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> 22. 5 % <b>filter</b> <b>cigarettes</b> without macroscopic ventilation and 4. 9 % undetermined. Thirty-six different cigarette brands were identified. A wide distribution of butt lengths (mean 32. 1 mm, variation coefficient 28 %), peripheral ovalisation of the filter in 83. 9 %, and extended browning {{of the mouth}} end of the filter in 48. 6 % were observed. Vent holes were macroscopically detectable in 70. 5 % and a sharp decrease in browning in 53. 4 % of the <b>filter</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> Most (94. 7 %) ventilation holes were located at > or = 10 mm from the mouth end. CONCLUSIONS: In a smoke-free hospital, the use of tobacco products (mainly ventilated <b>filter</b> <b>cigarettes)</b> remains sizeable. Given the wide distribution of butt lengths, the number of cigarettes per day is a poor marker of toxin intake. Vent-hole localisation and signs of vent-blocking confirm the inadequacy of machine-measured smoke yields {{and the presence of}} compensatory smoking. More intensive individual cessation advice with pharmacological support is necessary. Examination of a smoker's own cigarette butts {{can be used as a}} tool for individual cessation advice...|$|R
40|$|In a case control {{study of}} over 12 000 inpatients aged 35 - 74, risk of lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, and, {{particularly}} in those aged 35 - 54, ischaemic heart disease was positively associated {{with the number of}} manufactured cigarettes smoked daily and was negatively associated with long term giving up. Risk of stroke was not clearly related to smoking. Among manufactured cigarette smokers, lung cancer risk tended to be lowest in those who had always smoked <b>filter</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> This pattern was, however, evident only in men who additionally smoked pipes, cigars or handrolled cigarettes and in women, not being seen in men who smoked only manufactured cigarettes. Risk of lung cancer was not clearly related to time of switch to <b>filter</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> A markedly lower risk of chronic bronchitis was seen in men, but not women, who smoked filter rather than plain cigarettes. Heart disease risk did not vary by type of cigarette smoked 10 years before admission, but, compared with those who had never smoked <b>filter</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> those who had ever smoked <b>filter</b> <b>cigarettes</b> had a higher risk in men and a lower risk in younger women. Compared with the general population, markedly more controls were ex-smokers, suggesting incipient disease, whether or not smoking related, may alter smoking habits, thus affecting the interpretability of the findings. Control smokers were also relatively much more likely to report smoking plain cigarettes than expected. This comparison, not made in other studies relating risk to type of cigarette smoked, indicates that great care must be taken in verifying validity of reported smoking habits. While our findings are compatible with other evidence that risk of lung cancer and chronic bronchitis is probably reduced by switching from plain to <b>filter</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> they underline the difficulties in obtaining valid evidence from epidemiological studies...|$|R
