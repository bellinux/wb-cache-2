5|$|On November 22, 1920, Rixey {{was traded}} to the Cincinnati Reds in {{exchange}} for Jimmy Ring and <b>Greasy</b> Neale. His record during his eight seasons with the Phillies was 87 wins and 103 losses.|$|E
5|$|Fleischer also voices Benny the Cab and {{two members}} of Doom's Weasel Gang, Psycho and <b>Greasy.</b> Lou Hirsch, who {{supplied}} the voice for Baby Herman, was the original choice for Benny the Cab but was replaced by Fleischer.|$|E
5|$|Together with H.pustulatus, H.persoonii, H.mesotephrus and H.latitabundus, H.olivaceoalbus {{form the}} section Olivaceoumbrini within the genus Hygrophorus. The fungi {{of this section}} have <b>greasy</b> to slimy caps and stems. Their caps are darkish brown grey, olive or orange, and their stems are ed or {{somewhat}} distinctly ringed.|$|E
5|$|Đurić {{lives in}} Holland Village, Singapore. As {{part of his}} {{rigorous}} fitness regime, he runs 15km around his neighbourhood every morning. He does not drink, smoke or do late nights. He avoids chili and limits his intake of <b>greasy</b> food like prata and chicken rice, and keeps up with his fitness regime in the off-season.|$|E
5|$|Professor Severus Snape, {{who has a}} hooked nose, sallow {{complexion}} and <b>greasy</b> black hair, teaches Potions, {{but would}} prefer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts. Snape praises pupils in Slytherin, his own House but seizes every opportunity to humiliate others, especially Harry. Several incidents, beginning with the shooting pain in Harry's scar during the start-of-term feast, lead Harry and his friends to think Snape is a follower of Voldemort.|$|E
5|$|Seborrheic-like {{psoriasis}} is {{a common}} form of psoriasis with clinical aspects of psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis, {{and it may be}} difficult to distinguish from the latter. This form of psoriasis typically manifests as red plaques with <b>greasy</b> scales in areas of higher sebum production such as the scalp, forehead, skin folds next to the nose, skin surrounding the mouth, skin on the chest above the sternum, and in skin folds.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of coon hunting is sometimes associated with possum hunting, since the same dogs were often used, {{the animals are}} both climbers by nature, and are common in the same geographic areas. However, opossums are criticized for being too easy to hunt and too <b>greasy</b> to be edible if killed, and are seldom hunted today.|$|E
5|$|Born in Payette, Idaho on June 29, 1936, Harmon Killebrew was {{youngest}} {{of four children}} to Harmon Clayton, Sr. and Katherine Pearl (May) Killebrew. His father, a painter and sheriff, {{was a member of}} an undefeated Millikin College football team who was later named an All-American under eventual Pro Football Hall of Fame coach <b>Greasy</b> Neale. According to family legend, Harmon Killebrew's grandfather was the strongest man in the Union Army, winning every available heavyweight wrestling championship. Clayton encouraged Harmon and his brothers to stay active in various sports before his sudden death in 1953 at age 59.|$|E
5|$|Custer’s 7th Cavalry {{advance party}} {{attacked}} Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their {{camp on the}} Little Big Horn River (known as the <b>Greasy</b> Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not realize how large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bull’s, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed {{as they entered the}} tribe’s camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.|$|E
5|$|He {{then took}} up the {{challenge}} of returning the Philadelphia Eagles to their previous glory when he was hired on February 8, 1951, succeeding Earle (<b>Greasy)</b> Neale. After two games, both victories, McMillin underwent surgery for what {{was thought to be}} stomach ulcers. The findings were far worse: stomach cancer, which ended his coaching career. On March 31, 1952 (exactly 21 years after the death of Knute Rockne), McMillin died of a heart attack; his funeral was attended by many fellow coaches and former players.|$|E
5|$|His passing did not {{diminish}} his popularity in Philadelphia {{and in a}} 1999 Philadelphia Daily News poll, he {{was selected as the}} city's greatest professional coach/manager, beating out other notable coaches such as: Connie Mack of MLB Philadelphia Athletics, Dick Vermeil, and <b>Greasy</b> Neale of the NFL Philadelphia Eagles. In 2010 there was a push to get him elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame, which included an online petition at Flyershistory.net. Shero was eventually elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder in 2013. He remains the winningest coach in Flyers history with 308 wins, plus 48 more in playoff competition.|$|E
5|$|The Mersea Week is {{a week-long}} August festival of boat racing {{organised}} by the West Mersea Yacht Club and Dabchicks Sailing Club, established in 1973. During the week, starting on Monday, there are races for many boat {{classes in the}} Blackwater Estuary, from Optimist dinghies to large yachts. The most celebrated event is the Round-the-Island race, where dinghies attempt to sail round the island in either direction, helped over the Strood by volunteers. On Saturday, there is a regatta at West Mersea, followed by a selection of water sports and a firework display at dusk. One of the popular events on Saturday is walking a <b>greasy</b> pole rigged {{over the side of}} the hosting Thames sailing barge.|$|E
5|$|Back, leg, {{and neck}} {{injuries}} {{began to take}} a toll on Van Buren in 1950, and his production dropped. He broke his toe in the 1950 off-season and suffered from bone spurs, which caused him to miss the team's four preseason exhibition games and regular season opener. He returned to lead the league in carries for the fourth straight season, but lost the rushing title {{for the first time}} in four years and had career-lows in touchdowns and yards per carry. The Eagles finished with a 6–6 regular season record. <b>Greasy</b> Neale was fired by the Eagles the following February and replaced by Bo McMillin. In 1951, Van Buren played alongside his brother, halfback and linebacker Ebert, whom the Eagles selected in that year's draft out of LSU. The elder Van Buren continued to play through injuries, taking several shots of Novocaine before each game. He had a career-low 327 rushing yards for the season, as the Eagles finished with a losing record for the first time since 1942.|$|E
5|$|The {{aim of the}} ducker was to {{get every}} {{duckling}} as fat as possible {{by the age of}} eight weeks (the first moult, the age at which they would be killed for meat), while avoiding any foods which would build up their bones or make their flesh <b>greasy.</b> In their first week after hatching, the ducklings would be fed on boiled eggs, toast soaked in water, boiled rice and beef liver. From the second week on, this diet would gradually be replaced by barley meal and boiled rice mixed with greaves. (Some larger-scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to the ducklings in place of greaves.) This high-protein diet was supplemented with nettles, cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins. As with all poultry, ducks require grit in their diet to break up the food and make it digestible. Aylesbury ducklings' drinking water was laced with grit from Long Marston and Gubblecote; this grit also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour. Around 85% of ducklings would survive this eight-week rearing process to be sent to market.|$|E
5|$|This sturdily built {{antelope}} has {{a yellow}} to grayish brown coat. Generally, the bohor reedbuck is yellower than other reedbucks. The large and diffuse sebaceous glands {{present on the}} coat make the coat <b>greasy</b> {{and give it a}} strong odour. Juveniles are darker than the adults as well as long-haired. While R. r. bohor appears yellowish gray, R. r. wardi is richly tinted. The undersides are white in color. A few distinct markings can be observed—such as a dark stripe on the front of each foreleg; white markings under the tail; and a pale ring of hair around the eyes and along the lips, lower jaw, and upper throat. However, R. r. redunca lacks dark stripes on its forelegs. The males have thicker necks. Its large, oval-shaped ears distinguish it from other antelopes. There is a round bare spot below each ear. Apart from sebaceous glands, bohor reedbuck have a pair of inguinal glands and vestigial foot glands, and four nipples. A bohor reedbuck can survive for at least ten years. The tracks of the bohor reedbuck are slightly smaller than those of the southern reedbuck.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, the {{original}} {{mix of the}} album was released {{as part of a}} compilation entitled <b>Greasy</b> Love Songs. Allmusic's François Couture gave the album's 1984 remix 3 out of 5 stars. Another writer for the site, Sean Westergaard, gave <b>Greasy</b> Love Songs 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E

25|$|On 8 September 1926, a {{passenger}} train {{was unable to}} stop at Leeds Wellington station due to <b>greasy</b> rails after a thunderstorm. It crashed through the buffers {{and ended up in}} building. There were no injuries.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently various revivals titled Ol' 55, The Fives, Frankie J. Holden & The Fives, Ol' Skydaddys, On The Prowl, Legends of Ol'55, and Take It <b>Greasy</b> {{were formed}} which {{contained}} {{members of the}} 1976 line-up of the band and played their material.|$|E
25|$|<b>Greasy</b> spot, a {{fungal disease}} {{caused by the}} Mycosphaerella citri, {{produces}} leaf spots and premature defoliation, thus reducing the tree's vigour and yield. Ascospores of M. citri are generated in pseudothecia in decomposing fallen leaves. Once mature, ascospores are ejected and subsequently dispersed by air currents.|$|E
25|$|The {{franchise}} {{was established}} in 1933 {{as a replacement for}} the bankrupt Frankford Yellow Jackets, when a group led by Bert Bell secured the rights to an NFL franchise in Philadelphia. Bell, Chuck Bednarik, Bob Brown, Reggie White, Steve Van Buren, Tommy McDonald, <b>Greasy</b> Neale, Pete Pihos, Sonny Jurgensen, and Norm Van Brocklin have been inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
25|$|Diesel is less {{flammable}} than gasoline/petroleum spirit. However, {{because it}} evaporates slowly, spills on a roadway can pose slip hazard to vehicles. After the light fractions have evaporated, a <b>greasy</b> slick is {{left on the}} road which reduces tire grip and traction, and can cause vehicles to skid. The loss of traction {{is similar to that}} encountered on black ice, resulting in especially dangerous situations for two-wheeled vehicles, such as motorcycles and bicycles, in roundabouts.|$|E
25|$|Noble often mimes actions on-stage to {{help the}} {{audience}} visualise his surreal ideas, for example, telling the audience to never put a blanket over an owl, and exactly what an owl neck detection device is ("just a stick with a pointy bit on it") or showing the audience how to serve double header ice creams properly after considering his own made-up plot of 24 in which Jack Bauer escapes a cell using a <b>greasy</b> goose.|$|E
25|$|The band enjoyed {{popularity}} with {{a style that}} bordered on parody but managed to combine novelty retro kitsch and clever theatrics with {{a keen sense of}} pop dynamics and an acute understanding of rock 'n' roll. The band scored five top 20 hits on the Australian Kent Music Report singles chart and their debut album, Take It <b>Greasy</b> peaked at No.3 on the Australian albums chart in 1976. After line-up changes, Ol' 55 disbanded in 1983.|$|E
25|$|Bishen Singh Bedi, {{the under}} {{pressure}} {{captain of the}} Indian cricket team, was not convinced the Vaseline was to keep sweat out of the eyes. He said Lever had used unfair means to shine the ball. The English paceman’s habit of rubbing the ball over his eyebrows {{every now and then}} was also noticed. Tests on the cricket ball revealed presence of <b>greasy</b> substance. Whether the Vaseline had been intentionally applied to the ball or not was later disputed, and Lever's previous performances on the tour questioned.|$|E
25|$|Persons with ONJ {{may have}} either {{necrotic}} bone or bone marrow {{that has been}} slowly strangulated or nutrient-starved. Bone with chronically poor blood flow develops either a fibrous marrow since fibres can more easily live in nutrient starved areas, a <b>greasy,</b> dead fatty marrow (wet rot), a very dry, sometimes leathery marrow (dry rot), or a completely hollow marrow space (osteocavitation), also typical of ONJ. The blood flow impairment occurs following a bone infarct, a blood clot forming inside the smaller blood vessels of cancellous bone tissue.|$|E
25|$|Lithography was {{discovered}} in 1797, at first used in printing paper images. An image is drawn with a <b>greasy</b> crayon on a smooth stone or zinc surface, which is then wetted. The water remains on the stone but is repelled by the grease. Ink is spread on and is repelled by the water but remains on the grease. Paper is than pressed onto the slab. It picks up the ink from the grease, thus reproducing the drawing. The process can be repeated to make many copies.|$|E
25|$|Basidiocarps are agaricoid, up to 125mm (5in) tall, the cap {{narrowly}} conical at first, retaining {{an acute}} umbo when expanded, up to 75mm (3in) across, often splitting when expanded, the margins turning upwards. The cap surface is smooth to fibrillose, slightly shiny or <b>greasy,</b> pale rose-pink to lilac-pink (rarely white). The lamellae (gills) are widely spaced, waxy, cap-coloured or whiter. The stipe (stem) is smooth, white to pale cap-coloured, lacking a ring. The spore print is white, the spores (under a microscope) smooth, inamyloid, ellipsoid, c. 6.5 to 8.0 by 4.5 to 5.5μm.|$|E
