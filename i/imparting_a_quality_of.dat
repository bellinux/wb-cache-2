Universities are increasingly faced with budget constraints that limit their abilities to acquire these resources. To meet this challenge schools create unique partnerships with corporate America to accomplish their goal of achieving academic excellence. These partnerships vary in scope, objectives and goals based on the partners involved. In this paper we present a framework for developing an academic industry partnership that provides significant benefits to both parties. Other interested institutions can set up similar consortiums by using this framework as a guideline...|$|R

40|$|Dr. Genichi Taguchi {{looked at}} <b>quality</b> in <b>a</b> broader term and gave <b>an</b> {{excellent}} definition <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> in terms <b>of</b> loss to society.

In this paper, it has been proposed that the scope <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> product shall be further enhanced by considering the losses <b>imparted</b> by <b>a</b> poor <b>quality</b> product to society at large, due to associated environmental and safety related factors, over the complete life cycle of the product.
