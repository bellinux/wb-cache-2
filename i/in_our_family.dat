Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva {{does not mean the}} same thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>family,</b> learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance, and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Stone {{recalled}} that “There {{was only one}} will <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>family,</b> {{and that was my}} father’s,” she described the family government characteristic of her day. Hannah Stone earned [...] a modest income through selling eggs and cheese but was denied any control over that money, sometimes denied money to purchase things Francis considered trivial. Believing she had a right to her own earnings, Hannah sometimes stole coins from his purse or secretly sold a cheese. As a child, Lucy resented instances of what she saw as her father’s unfair management of the family’s money. But she later came to realize that custom was to blame, and the injustice only demonstrated “the necessity of making custom right, if it must rule.” ...|$|E

Antonio played college basketball with the Memphis Tigers under head coach John Calipari and was most notably named Conference USA Defensive Player of the Year in 2009. He has experience playing professional basketball in the NBA Development League and outside North America. He also played alongside Anthony with the Saint John Mill Rats in 2012. The National Basketball Association (NBA) team, the Oklahoma City Thunder, signed him to multiple 10-day contracts in February 2010. The two brothers' uncle, Marvin Avery, said, [...] "There's some <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>family</b> {{that have been in}} trouble, but we always had Antonio and his brother [...] playing basketball or traveling somewhere to play basketball at all times."

40|$|PURPOSE: Two large Canadian kindreds {{appearing}} to segregate febrile convulsions as an autosomal dominant trait were evaluated for linkage to three known FC loci, {{as well as}} other epilepsy loci. METHODS: Members of the two families were genotyped with microsatellite markers linked to the previously identified febrile convulsion loci, FEB 1, FEB 2, and GEFS+, and we performed two-point linkage analyses by assuming an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. RESULTS: We report the exclusion of the FC trait <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>families</b> to FEB 1 on 8 q 13 - 21 and to a second febrile convulsion locus on 19 p 13. Furthermore, we also excluded the GEFS+ locus on 19 q 13. 1 as the cause of febrile convulsions in both kindreds. Microsatellite markers linked to juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (EJM 1), benign neonatal familial convulsions EBN 1 and EBN 2, autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE), idiopathic generalized epilepsy (EGI), progressive myoclonic epilepsy of Unverricht-Lundborg (EPM 1), and partial epilepsy with auditory features (EPT), were also excluded as potential loci linked to the FC trait <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>families.</b> CONCLUSIONS: These findings favor considerable genetic heterogeneity for febrile convulsions...|$|R
