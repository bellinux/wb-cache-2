This paper describes a congestion control algorithm for IEEE 802. 17 Resilient Packet Rings called the Enhanced Conservative Mode algorithm that aims to avoid congestion and achieve a fair rate allocation for fairness <b>eligible</b> <b>traffic</b> in the case of a single bottleneck. We first present analysis to show that existing approaches for RPR congestion control (aggressive and conservative mode) have deficiencies. We present simulation results showing that the proposed enhanced conservative mode congestion control algorithm, is a significant improvement. In conjunction with other mechanisms specified in the IEEE 802. 17 MAC, the proposed algorithm achieves high utilization on the ring with minimal starvation and oscillations, allows sources to fast start, and provides quality of service for multiple classes of service that require rate, delay and jitter guarantees.

However, the used traffic management solutions in the Net are restricted so they are not adequate to the contemporary services. The increasing demand on using <b>eligible</b> and efficient <b>traffic</b> management and engineering methods appears in the protocols/methods being under research/standardisation phase, such as MPLS-Traffic Engineering, OSPF-OMP, MPLS-OMP, etc. This paper discusses the application of OSPF-OMP and MPLS-OMP (OMP: Optimised MultiPath) technique for Traffic Engineering purposes in IP networks and reviews OMP simulation results...|$|R
40|$|A {{wireless}} {{local area}} network (WLAN) or a cell with quality‐of‐service (QoS) guarantees for various types of traffic is considered. A centralized (i. e., star) network is adopted as the topology of a cell which consists of a base station and a number of mobile clients. Dynamic Time Division Duplexed (TDD) transmission is used, and hence, the same frequency channel is time‐shared for downlink and uplink transmissions under the dynamic control of the base station. We divide traffic into two classes: class I (real‐time) and II (non‐real‐time). Whenever there is no <b>eligible</b> class‐I <b>traffic</b> for transmission, class‐II traffic which requires no delay‐bound guarantees is transmitted, while uplink transmissions are controlled with a reservation scheme. Class‐I traffic which requires a bounded delay and guaranteed throughput is handled with the framing strategy (Golestani, IEEE J. Selected Areas Commun. 9 (7), 1991) which consists of a smoothness traffic model and the stop‐and‐go queueing scheme. We also establish the admission test for adding new class‐I connections. We present a modified framing strategy for class‐I voice uplink transmissions which utilizes the wireless link efficiently at the cost of some packet losses. Finally, we present the performance (average delay and throughput) evaluation of the reservation scheme for class‐II traffic using both analytical calculations and simulations...|$|R

How to use {{existing}} asbuton diverse as Lasbutag (Layer Asphalt Buton loamy) mixture of cold or Acas (Aggregate Cold Abuton Sheet), or hot mix Asbuton Ahaz (Aggregate Asbuton Hot Sheet), non-aggregate hot mix Asbuton Nahas (Non Aggregate Asbuton Hot Sheet) and non-aggregate Asbuton cold mixture NACAS (Non Aggregate Cold Asbuton Sheet). Use Asbuton on Final Compaction Effect Variation Against Marshall Stability values on LASBUTAG Mixed Heat, performed with variation of collisions on modifier composition 3. 6 %: 50 % and 3. 6 %: 75 %. Collision on hot mix LASBUTAG done with 50 x 2, 75 x 2, 100 x 2, 125 x 2, 150 x 2, 175 x 2 and 200 x 2 on each - each composition. Value marshall stability in hot mix LASBUTAG shows the initial value before any variation of the collision of 244. 772 kg of modifier 3. 6 %: 50 %, while the modifier 3. 6 %: 216. 733 75 % of its value, where the stability is <b>eligible</b> for low <b>traffic.</b> To be used for medium and heavy traffic, the collision is carried out at 49. 5 and 224. 6. In the hot mix composition LASBUTAG modifier 3. 6 %: 75 %, the collision is carried out at 105 and heavy traffic of 395. VIM in both compositions are still relatively large and showed a decrease with increasing stability in hot mix LASBUTAG. VMA qualify on both the composition of modifier, above 16 %. Flow of hot mix LASBUTAG trend shows decline with the collision. From the test results and analysis show that the compaction of different variations affect the value marshall stabilit...|$|R
40|$|General Sudirman Street as a Primary Arterial {{street in}} the city of Salatiga linking two major cities of Semarang and Surakarta. The high traffic density, the {{arrangement}} of parking and sidewalk vendors (vendors) using the street side resulting in traffic jams. To overcome this, the Government introduced one way street system. The application of it generates changes of traffic both on General Sudirman street and its intersections. Another impact is an increasing damage to roads due to the demolition of the road median. This study aims to evaluate the performance of road and intersections after application of one-way street, evaluating pavement conditions and strength, and determination of the pattern of road maintenance based on condition of existing damage. Data obtained through primary data collection (traffic volume survey, damage survey, and taking the marshall test), as well as secondary data collection (CBR subgrade, climate data, traffic growth). The performance of roads and intersections were evaluated using the Indonesian Highway Capacity Manual (IHCM 1997). Evaluate the condition of road pavement using the Pavement Condition Indek method (PCI). Strength of pavement structure was evaluated by testing the Marshall and using Component Analysis Method SKBI 1987. The results showed that the performance of Sudirman street two-way road system does not qualify with the degree of saturation 0. 89 and level of service E where traffic jams is frequent. After the implementation of one way road system, the General Sudirman road performance is qualify with the degree of saturation values decreased to 0. 49 and level of service C where traffic flow is still stable. This is because the implementation of one way road system caused the flow of existing traffic downs. Golkar intersection performance with the degree of saturation 0. 513 still meet the requirements based on MKJI 1997 which is less than 0. 85. Road pavement condition obtained an average value of 49. 89 with PCI bad road conditions (poor), so that road surface conditions need improvement. Strength of a pavement structure are not <b>eligible</b> to serve <b>traffic</b> stability so an overlay to add strength to the structure of the road is needed. For the convenience of road users, repairments using the P 2 (laburan local asphalt) of 36, 05 m 2, P 4 (filling cracks) of 1, 52 m 2, P 5 (Patching a hole) equal to 41, 75 m 2, P 6 (flattening) of 428, 31 m 2 are needed. As for the design of a pavement with a design life of 5 years required a 5 cm thick laston overlay Keywords: performance, pavement, maintenance. ...|$|R
