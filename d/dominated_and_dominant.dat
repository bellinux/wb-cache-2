Network Analysis as presented gives us an external representation of a Technical and Functional network. Furthermore, three dimensions of the observed productive process are put forward: coordination, synchronization, and complexity. Two mechanisms of domination are extracted from the suggested synthesis between our theoretical framework and the empirical material gathered. Such mechanisms shape the filmmaking process as an exchange of <b>dominated</b> <b>and</b> <b>dominant</b> resources, given an unequal distribution structure. In all, Network Analysis is seen from a sociological perspective as useful, {{in order to understand the}} objective development of the filmmaking process. Nevertheless, it is claimed that power relations need to be analyzed further, as central elements in any social process...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} investigated {{attitudes and}} behaviours of socially excluded individuals as they engage with further learning through digital technologies in individually orientated and free informal learning settings. The study specifically explored {{the impact of}} socio-personal attitudinal and behavioural factors that may impede participation. The research was concentrated in a South East London borough and based within a successful joint initiative between a local authority and third sector organisations. This unique partnership, of over 25 centres, provided access to the hardest to reach groups in the deprived communities of the borough. A number of case studies have been included that give a flavour of the poignant journeys of socially excluded individuals. ] Past {{research in this area}} has been mainly limited to the investigation of economic barriers. The principal focus of this study is Azjen’s social psychological Theory of Planned Behaviour (TpB) which was concerned with localised social determinants of the individual. Research data was collected through questionnaires based on TpB and the raw data derived from these were statistically analysed using inferential statistics, chi-square (x 2) on SPSS. In addition, a number of interviews were also carried out to gain further insight into the broad perceptions of the individuals. Interview transcripts were analysed and two emergent themes identified: attitude and behaviour. The statistical analysis revealed that latent experiences and perception played a vital role in individuals’ life choices. These provide the foundation of the socio-personal factors that impact on socially excluded adults and influence their attitudes, behaviour and decision making process. In this study these have been shown {{to have an impact on}} attitudes towards any sort of learning/training including IT skills. The combination of poor experiences of school, no/low academic achievement, low self-esteem and confidence, along with a fear of failure has led to lives of worklessness or a continuous cycle of low skilled, low-waged employment, vulnerable to economic change. In addition, a minor analysis contributed through Bourdieu’s concepts established that the individual’s social class/group produced inherent issues of almost unconsciously accepted differentiation between the <b>dominated</b> <b>and</b> <b>dominant</b> classes...|$|E

40|$|The {{continuous}} monitoring from 1988 to 1995 of thinned and control Okoumé {{stands in the}} coastal forest of Gabon helps to evaluate the relevance of silvicultural treatment with regard to sustainable management. The stands, almost even-aged, are grouped according to their ages. The homogeneity of structural features between future thinned and control stands is verified. The thinning, carried out in 1989, is a selective thinning in the upper storey. The average removal of basal area is 36 % in young stands (15 to 30 years old) and 21 % in older ones (37 to 50 years old). More than 80 % comes from supernumerary dominant Okoumé trees (average volume at 7 cm diameter removed in older stands : 145 M 3 /haj. Six years after thinning, young and old stands have reacted favourably. The dominant population is not significantly weakened. The gain on average current diameter annual increment of Okoumé trees stabilized around 0, 2 to 0, 3 cm/yr. Related to the increment before thinning, this gain is substantial for <b>dominated</b> <b>and</b> small <b>dominant</b> trees but minor for big dominant trees. At stand level, the better growth of remaining trees not offset the loss of basal area due to thinning. In stands where the Okoumé {{accounts for more than}} 80 % of total basal area, the removal of large usable trees is too sizeable for thinning after 35 years to be relevant. This may not be the case in more mixed forests where the Okoumé represents only 30 - 80 % of total basal area, and the relevance of thinning in such stand...|$|R
40|$|In my view, {{consciousness}} {{refers to}} the full set of semiotic processes where the agents, objects and forces come from the material and social world. Any understanding that does not take the full nature of social intercourse under consideration is flawed. The social intercourse that occurs in the forms of communication and systems of exchange are associated with forms of social organizations that are necessary for their very existence. Ideology becomes important because it displays {{the image of the}} world as it ought to be from the perspectives of both <b>dominated</b> groups <b>and</b> <b>dominant</b> groups. I am employing Critical Race Theory as a perspective that interrogates the dominant ideological framework of American society [...] white male supremacy [...] as a means to participate in the social intercourse. I focus on AIDS and beliefs in AIDS origin stories not only as reflecting the hierarchial relations of power structures, but also as a discourse to enact and reinforce hierarchial relations. When we think about the system of domination associated with HIV and AIDS related illnesses, we know that certain messages from the ideological complexes {{will not be allowed to}} be presented. I find that the social structure offers many windows to examine the construction of and the opposition to social objects such as racism, sexism, gender oppression, sexualism, as well as other forms of group dynamics. AIDS is one site where these issues are both obvious and obscured. It is constant work to examine, document, and challenge the prevailing logics of oppression even when this logic is presented as a form of generosity. As part of the process, I examine a variety of points: methodology, cyborg politics, bodies and boundaries, cultural hegemony, sadism and masochism, and temporal refusal. ...|$|R
40|$|The real {{figure of}} fish fauna and fishery of the Danube delta is {{difficult}} to be estimated due to the limitation in fish sampling and underreporting of catch. This paper proposes to compare output of fish sampling with commercial catch statistics. Fish fauna from Danube delta complex lakes was sampled in 2006 - 2008 period and catchstatistics represent a long time series data recording. For fish sampling was used two complementary methods: electric fishing for shallow border zone and Nordic gillnet fishing for deep open water. The frequency of occurrence and the dominance in abundance analysis was based on 267 samples including 57158 individuals from both sampling methods since the dominance in biomass was based on 640 kg of fish only from gillnet sampling. In total was sampled 40 fish species, while catch statistics recorded 10 commercial species plus more 3 categories that include more other different species. In the sampling analysis, the most frequent species (very frequent) were perch, bleak, roach, rudd and white bream. The most abundant(eudominant <b>and</b> <b>dominant)</b> species were bleak, roach, rudd, perch, and white bream. In biomass <b>dominate</b> (eudominant <b>and</b> <b>dominant)</b> roach, rudd, perch, white bream, bleak, gibel carp and pike. This analysis shows that Danube delta lakes are dominate by small eurytopic and opportunistic species, favoured by eutrophication of lakes. However, this figure is expression of sampling methods that are limited in estimation of real fish population status. Nevertheless, when this structure is compared to commercial statistics, it is noticed completely other figure. The difference in fish structure {{may be explained by}} targeting fishing to large size and high market value fish species. It is not neglected that commercial statistics is deformed by unreported catch sold on black market. According with recorded statistics from 1920 until 2010 the catch trend continuously decrease and species composition was well balanced before 1972 and starting from 1972 until 2010, gibel carp become the dominant commercial species, followed by roach + rudd and bream + white bream. Since, fish estimation based on sampling gives valuable data on actual status of fish structure, catch statistics describe fish evolution and changes in time due to environmental pressure, both analyses are valuable tools in sustainable management of fish resources and for promoting conservation of fish diversity inDanube delta...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{political}} and cultural situation in Africa through the literary work On the Postcolony, written by Cameroonian theorist Achille Mbembe. The first part of our study is about Mbembe as a thinker; it explains how, academically, his method is very appropriate for a comprehension of the "postcolony" concerned in the book, and which philosophies and theories he spans. The second part analyzes four concepts utilized by Mbembe himself, which, in understanding On the Postcolony, are considered relevant means to that end. These are conviviality, violence and entanglement, followed by {{a breakdown of the}} term commandement. These concepts are employed in describing how and why {{the political and}} cultural situation in Africa appears as it does today. Conviviality as a term is depicted in the relationship between the <b>dominated</b> <b>and</b> the <b>dominant,</b> <b>and</b> concerns their living together in a seemingly grotesque reality. Violence illustrates the use of force, physically as well as psychologically, as a tool of domination, and how a tradition of violence permeates the postcolony. Entanglement spans the vast complexity of postcolonial society, throwing light on its actual relations of power and explaining why, as of yet, {{there is no such thing}} as a "public good". This paper holds that the concept of commandement is essential to postcolonial reality, and considers the three other terms to belong in an understanding of commandement. Mbembe argues that the commandement inherent in colonial rationality remains pervasive in the postcolony today, thus emphasizing that the postcolony must be understood in the light of the colonial period. Chaotic though the political and cultural situation in Africa may seem, Mbembe suggests that this is not merely the case. The post-colonies, to his mind, have the possibilities and potential for change not overtly negative. On the Postcolony seeks to re-think the analytical apparatus employed on Africa, drawing on several philosophies and theories, and approaches the postcolony in a new way. Mbembe's message in On the Postcolony seems to be that, contrary to a large part of existing writing on Africa, the focus should be on what there is to see today and what can become of it...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to analyze the effects of age, site, density and sociologic position on the height-diameter relationship The data carne from the measurement of height and diameter of trees in 137 plots of Pinus taeda, with area of 600 m 2, scatered in the State of Parana, Brazil, with ages ranging from 4 to 27 years old. The comparison among regression lines was done through the analysis of covariance. The comparison of means of values h/d was also done through statistic tests. Generic equations including age, site, density and sociologic position as independent variables were also tested a secondary proposed objective was to test the ideal number of trees (pairs of values h/d) for the fitting of the hipsometric relationship. The criteria for the selection of regression models in all phases of this research were the standart error of estimate (syx, syx%), and the residuals distributions. In a preliminary analysis they were selected four regression models (Stoffells, Curtis, Henricksen and Prodan), which were also used for the analysis of the other factors. To analyze the effect of age it was opted for a modal which included the reason height over dominant height (h/hdom =b 0 + b 1 In d), reducing considerably the standard error of estimate, In a general way, the covariance analysis detected a greater influence of age and site on the intercept (b 0) of regression lines. Refering to the inclination coefficient (b 1), the influences of density seemed to be stronger, producing steeper regression lines for the greater densities for all analyzed age classes. Refering the sociologic position for the three considered diameter classes, as <b>dominated,</b> mean <b>and</b> <b>dominant,</b> it was detected significant differences among them. The relationship h/d presented decreasing values from the dominated to the dominant diameter class. It was verified that 31 to 40 pairs of values h/d were better to fit the height-diameter equation. The use of a generic equation for the used set of data, seemed quite liable. From the four tested models the one that deserved more attention was: ln h = ln hdom + b 0 + b 1 ((1 /d) - (1 /dmax)), with standard error of estimate in percent equal to 6, 97 %, and presenting a good residual distribution...|$|R
40|$|The coastal {{forest of}} Gabon abounds in monospecific {{secondary}} Aucoumea klaineana stands derived from natural regeneration after shifting cultivation. This paper aims {{to describe the}} changes in the structure and dynamics of these stands with age. It then assesses the impact of selective thinning in the upper storey on both structural and dynamic parameters. The experiment consisted of 34 Permanent Plots in stands from establishment to more mature stages (ca. 50 years old). Thirteen plots (17 [...] 45 years old) were thinned. More than 80 % of the removal came from supernumerary dominant A. klaineana. A. klaineana represented 60 % of the total density in stands ca. 15 years old but > 90 % of the dominant trees in older stands. The changes with age in the floristic composition of the unthinned stands showed three successional stages during which pioneer species associated with A. klaineana (from establishment to ca. 15 years) were progressively replaced by mature forest species. Basal area increased and density decreased with age before reaching stable values at ca. 40 [...] 45 years. Mortality was very high in young stands but decreased in the older ones. Mortality generally affected small diameter individuals in the <b>dominated</b> storey. Diameter <b>and</b> basal area increments showed that the stand growth resulted from the growth of dominant A. klaineana. Diameter increments of A. klaineana were elevated during the first years of colonisation (1. 9 cm/year) and were still ca. 0. 7 cm/year for 50 -year-old dominant trees. Thinning did not increase the mortality of the dominant population. It favoured the individual growth of A. klaineana. The gain was substantial for <b>dominated</b> trees <b>and</b> small <b>dominant</b> trees (from 60 to 100 %) but was lower for large dominant trees (ca. 25 [...] 30 %). Therefore, stimulation of individual growth did not compensate for the loss of basal area at the stand level...|$|R

40|$|Efficient routing among a set {{of mobile}} hosts (also called nodes) {{is one of the}} most {{important}} functions in ad hoc wireless networks. Routing based on a connected dominating set is a promising approach, where the search space for a route is reduced to the nodes in the set. A set is dominating if all the nodes in the system are either in the set or neighbors of nodes in the set. In this paper, we extend dominating-set-based routing to networks with unidirectional links. Specifically, an efficient localized algorithm for determining a <b>dominating</b> <b>and</b> absorbant set of vertices (mobile hosts) is given and this set can be easily updated when the network topology changes dynamically. A host v is called a dominating neighbor (absorbant neighbor) of another host u if there is a directed edge from v to u (from u to v). A subset of vertices is <b>dominating</b> <b>and</b> absorbant if every vertex not in the subset has one <b>dominating</b> neighbor <b>and</b> one absorbant neighbor in the subset. The derived <b>dominating</b> <b>and</b> absorbant set exhibits good locality properties; that is, the change of a node status (dominating/dominated) affects only the status of nodes in the neighborhood. The notion of <b>dominating</b> <b>and</b> absorbant set can also be applied iteratively on the <b>dominating</b> <b>and</b> absorbant set itself, forming a hierarchy of <b>dominating</b> <b>and</b> absorbant sets. The effectiveness of our approach is confirmed and the locality of node status update is verified through simulation...|$|R
