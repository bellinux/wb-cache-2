40|$|In upper-room {{ultraviolet}} germicidal irradiance (UVGI) design, irradiance is {{an important}} characteristic, with two opposing dominant dynamics: high-level irradiation on the microorganism and minimum levels of irradiance on human skin and eyes. The use of high-level ray-tracing procedures is followed in establishing radiance and irradiance levels. The main constants in a room influencing these calculations are the spectral and spatial characteristics of the radiation sources in the inter-reflecting surfaces inside the luminaire, {{as well as the}} surfaces in the room. The most important characteristic to be determined for the radiation source prior to calculations is its spatial radiant intensity distribution. This characterization is performed using a <b>gonioradiometer.</b> The complexity of the physical construction of the luminaire will {{determine the extent to which}} measurements have to be taken. Accurate <b>gonioradiometer</b> readings provide the required radiant intensities in all directions for computer-aided design (CAD), and can also be used to determine the total radiant flux leaving the luminaire, as well as calculating isoirradiance surfaces around the UVGI luminaire. This study will present a laboratory experimental approach to deriving the radiant intensity distribution of a UVGI luminaire. The UVGI luminaire is then characterized in situ, and compared with the gonioradiometric output.

40|$|On-orbit radiometric {{characterization}} of the multispectral (MS) imagery of the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) ’s Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite- 3 A (KOMPSAT- 3 A), which was launched on 25 March 2015, was conducted to provide quantitative radiometric information about KOMPSAT- 3 A. During the in-orbit test (IOT), vicarious radiometric calibration of KOMPSAT- 3 A was performed using the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6 S) radiative transfer model. The characteristics of radiometric tarps, the atmospheric optical depth from multi-filter rotating shadowband radiometer (MFRSR) measurements, and sun–sensor–geometry were carefully considered, in order to calculate the exact top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance received by KOMPSAT- 3 A MS bands. In addition, the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) behaviors of the radiometric tarps were measured in the laboratory with a two-dimensional hyperspectral <b>gonioradiometer,</b> {{to compensate for the}} geometry discrepancy between the satellite and the ASD FieldSpec® 3 spectroradiometer. The match-up datasets between the TOA radiance and the digital number (DN) from KOMPSAT- 3 A were used to determine DN-to-radiance conversion factors, based on linear least squares fitting for two field campaigns. The final results showed that the R 2 values between the observed and simulated radiances for the blue, green, red, and near-infrared (NIR) bands, are greater than 0. 998. An approximate error budget analysis for the vicarious calibration of KOMPSAT- 3 A showed an error of less than 6. 8 %. When applying the laboratory-based BRDF correction to the case of higher viewing zenith angle geometry, the gain ratio was improved, particularly for the blue (1. 3 %) and green (1. 2 %) bands, which exhibit high sensitivity to the BRDF of radiometric tarps during the backward-scattering phase. The calculated gain ratio {{between the first and second}} campaigns showed a less than 5 % discrepancy, indicating that the determined radiometric characteristics of KOMPSAT- 3 A are reliable and useful to the user group for quantitative applications...|$|E
