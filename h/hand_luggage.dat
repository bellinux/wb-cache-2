5|$|Petersen {{has claimed}} in an {{interview}} that one of the film's scenes forced the crew to adopt a guerrilla filmmaking approach. The scene in which Petersen's character Will Graham falls asleep while studying crime scene photographs during a flight required the use of an airplane during shooting. Michael Mann had been unable to gain permission to use a plane for the scene and booked tickets for the crew on a flight from Chicago to Florida. Once on board, the crew used their equipment, checked in as <b>hand</b> <b>luggage,</b> to shoot the scene quickly, while keeping the plane's passengers and crew mollified with Manhunter crew jackets.|$|E
5|$|The {{hijacking}} {{occurred on}} board Braathens SAFE Flight 139 {{en route from}} Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The aircraft was a Boeing 737–205, named Harald Gille (after Harald IV of Norway) with registration LN-SUG. The day before the hijacking, Huseby graduated from upper secondary school, where he studied health and social work. That evening, he purchased an air gun in Trondheim. The weapon was in his <b>hand</b> <b>luggage</b> when boarding the aircraft at Trondheim Airport, Værnes, {{where there was no}} security control. He selected a seat {{at the rear of the}} aircraft. While airborne, the hijacker showed a female flight attendant the air gun, and asked her to inform the captain that he wanted control over the aircraft, but that otherwise all was to proceed as planned. The flight attendant and later the hijacker used the intercom to communicate with the pilot. The police were informed about the incident via air controllers at 15:05.|$|E

25|$|Starting 1 April 2003 Kato Airline {{took over}} two public service {{obligation}} routes, which received subsidies from the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Both were out of Bodø, one to Røst Airport {{and the other to}} Narvik Airport, Framnes—the downtown airport serving Narvik. The same year the airline won four-year contract with Norway Post to operate postal flights from Trondheim to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø. Kato Airline was allowed to operate the route with a Dornier Do 228, a significantly smaller aircraft than the incumbent de Havilland Canada Dash 8 used by Widerøe. By December both routes had seen a drastic fall in patronage. Røst Municipal Council came with a statement criticizing the ministry for allowing such aircraft, stating that the lacked among other amenities accessibility, pressure cabin, weather radar, space for <b>hand</b> <b>luggage</b> and that the airline did not operate with discount tickets.

As I said the words, Mr. Godfrey himself {{knocked at the}} door to say good-bye, and was followed in by Mr. Franklin, who was going with him to the station. My lady explained the difficulty. Mr. Godfrey settled it directly. He called to Samuel, through the window, to take his portmanteau up-stairs again, and he then put the key himself into Sergeant Cuff's <b>hand.</b> [...] "My <b>luggage</b> can follow me to London," [...] he said, [...] "when the inquiry is over." [...] The Sergeant received the key with a becoming apology. [...] "I am sorry to put you to any inconvenience, sir, for a mere formality; but the example of their betters will do wonders in reconciling the servants to this inquiry." [...] Mr. Godfrey, after taking leave of my lady, in a most sympathising manner, left a farewell message for Miss Rachel, the terms of which made it clear to my mind that he had not taken No for an answer, and that he meant to put the marriage question to her once more, at the next opportunity. Mr. Franklin, on following his cousin out, informed the Sergeant that all his clothes were open to examination, and that nothing he possessed was kept under lock and key. Sergeant Cuff made his best acknowledgments. His views, you will observe, had been met with the utmost readiness by my lady, by Mr. Godfrey, and by Mr. Franklin. There was only Miss. Rachel now wanting to follow their lead, before we called the servants together, and began the search for the stained dress.|$|R

Lucia then explains to Gabrielle that her boyfriend left her and she needed a place to stay. When Gabrielle finds out that she {{may not be able to}} get pregnant, Lucia happily agrees to be their surrogate. Immediately, Gabrielle feels very uncomfortable with the idea, while Carlos believes it is a wonderful suggestion. Later, Gabrielle tells her mother she would be happy to have her as the surrogate and the two go out for a lunch at a nearby hotel. As they approach the hotel, Gabrielle kicks Lucia out of the car, telling her to get a room and to leave her alone and drives off. At home, Carlos tells Gabrielle that it wasn't a smart idea to do that. Gabrielle insists that because there has been awkwardness since Gabrielle ran away from home some 15 years ago that her mother would not understand. Carlos then tries to smooth things over by going to Lucia's hotel room to tell her that she can still be the surrogate but that she needs to understand why Gabrielle left. Lucia says that she knows Gabrielle left because she purposely slept with Alejandro, her second husband to get her jealous and that she has forgiven her. Carlos does not believe this and <b>hands</b> Lucia her <b>luggage.</b> Carlos then goes home and suggests to Gabrielle that they adopt. Seeing as she has sabotaged her visit with her daughter, Lucia decides to phone her Aunt Inez who is recovering from an illness and [...] "is willing to stay for however long it takes".|$|R

2500|$|On 10 August 2006, British Home Secretary John Reid, {{broke the}} news, along with Douglas Alexander, the Transport Secretary. The same day, Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Paul Stephenson, {{said that a}} plot, {{intended}} to destroy as many as ten aircraft in mid-flight from the United Kingdom to the United States using explosives brought on board in the suspects' <b>hand</b> <b>luggage,</b> had been disrupted. News media reported that planned targets included American Airlines, British Airways, Continental Airlines, and United Airlines flights from London Heathrow and London Gatwick airports to Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles; Miami; Orlando; Boston; Newark; New York City; San Francisco; Cleveland and Washington, D.C. Air Canada flights were also included, with destinations being Montreal and Toronto. BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the plot involved a series of simultaneous attacks, targeting three planes each time. Reports vary regarding the number of planes involved, ranging from three to twelve. In a press release, the United States Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, said [...] "multiple commercial aircraft" [...] were targeted. Some reports say the attacks were planned for 16 August, but police said {{no evidence of any}} specific date had been found. British officials later stated that the estimate of ten aircraft was [...] "speculative and exaggerated." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in {{the summer}} of 1942, Ion Antonescu became a {{perpetrator}} of the Porajmos, or Holocaust-related crimes against the Romani people, when he ordered the Transnistrian deportation of Romanian Romani from the Old Kingdom, transited through camps and resettled in inhumane conditions near the Southern Bug. They were joined there by 2,000 conscientious objectors of the Inochentist church, a millennialist denomination. As Antonescu admitted during his trial, he personally supervised these operations, giving special orders to the Gendarmerie commanders. In theory, the measures taken against Romani people were supposed to affect only nomads and those with a criminal record created or updated recently, but arbitrary exceptions were immediately made to this rule, in particular by using the vague notion of [...] "undesirable" [...] to define some members of sedentary communities. The central authorities noted differences in the criteria applied locally, and intervened to prevent or sanction under-deportation and, in some cases, over-deportation. Antonescu and Constantin Vasiliu had been made aware of the problems Transnistria faced in feeding its own population, but ignored them when deciding in favor of expulsion. With most of their property confiscated, the Romani men, women and children were only allowed to carry <b>hand</b> <b>luggage,</b> on which they were supposed to survive winter. Famine and disease ensued from criminal negligence, Romani survival being largely dependent on occasional government handouts, the locals' charity, stealing and an underground economy. Once caught, escapees who made their way back into Romania were returned by the central authorities, even as local authorities were objecting.|$|E
2500|$|The Cathay Pacific flight {{carrying}} the Beatles landed at Manila Airport at 4.30 pm on 3 July. The nation's {{police and military}} forces were {{in a state of}} high alert comparable with President Eisenhower's 1960 visit; noting the prevalence of firearms, one of the Beatles asked whether there was a war taking place in the Philippines. In Starr's description, the atmosphere was [...] "that hot/Catholic/gun/Spanish Inquisition attitude". Whereas the band and their entourage were usually given the privileges afforded visiting diplomats, on this occasion, the four Beatles were hustled into a vehicle by armed men wearing civilian clothes. Harrison later recalled their alarm at being separated from Epstein, Aspinall and Mal Evans {{for the first time on}} a tour; his immediate concern was that, with their <b>hand</b> <b>luggage</b> left behind on the runway, the band would be arrested once their supplies of marijuana were discovered by the authorities. The Beatles were driven to the headquarters of the Philippines Navy on Manila Harbour and led to a press conference attended by 40 journalists. They were then escorted by military personnel to a luxury yacht owned by Don Manolo Elizalde, a wealthy Filipino industrialist, whose 24-year-old son wanted to host a party to show off the Beatles to his friends. Epstein finally caught up with the band before the yacht sailed out into Manila Bay. After spending several hours on board, he and the Beatles returned to the marina and, at 4 am, arrived at the Manila Hotel, where Epstein had booked accommodation.|$|E
2500|$|The Madonna {{remained}} in Essen throughout World War I but was again evacuated in its aftermath. After the communist revolt in the Ruhr {{area in the}} spring of 1920, the authorities of St. Johannes parish, fearing another uprising, decided to hide the statue in a safe place that would be unknown even to its own priest so as to prevent discovery by treason or extortion. A goldsmith from Aachen was assigned to find a hiding place, and he finally negotiated with another German diocese that the Madonna {{and the rest of the}} Essen treasure was to be concealed in a place that only the goldsmith and a designated guardian would know about: even the bishop was only informed about the general plan, but not about the exact location of the sanctuary. A document detailing the whereabouts was deposited in a Dutch diocese in case the middleman was killed. The plan worked so well that to this day it is unknown where exactly the treasure was hidden at that time. The only certainty is that it was packed in shabby cardboard suitcases and taken to some place in the Diocese of Hildesheim. The voucher deposited in the Netherlands was destroyed after the treasure was finally brought back to Essen in 1925 when the political situation seemed stable. In the summer of 1925 the goldsmith from Aachen and his son retrieved the treasure from its sanctuary and brought it back to Essen, travelling in a fourth-class Reichsbahn carriage and carrying the treasure inconspicuously as <b>hand</b> <b>luggage.</b>|$|E

Then at last came Ciccio, shouldering one small trunk, whilst a porter followed, shouldering another. Out they trotted, leaving Alvina abandoned with the pile of <b>hand</b> <b>luggage.</b> She waited. The train drew out. Ciccio and the porter came bustling back. They took her out through the little gate, to where, in the flat desert space behind the railway, stood two great drab motor-omnibuses, and a rank of open carriages. Ciccio was handing up the handbags to the roof of one of the big post-omnibuses. When it was finished the man on the roof came down, and Ciccio gave him and the station porter each sixpence. The station-porter immediately threw his coin on the ground with a gesture of indignant contempt, spread his arms wide and expostulated violently. Ciccio expostulated back again, and they pecked at each other, verbally, like two birds. It ended by the rolling up of the burly, black moustached driver of the omnibus. Whereupon Ciccio quite amicably gave the porter two nickel twopences in addition to the sixpence, whereupon the porter quite lovingly wished him [...] "buon' viaggio." ...|$|E
