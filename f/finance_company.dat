40|$|Abstract. The {{board of}} {{directors}} performs {{a very important role}} in formulating and monitoring the strategy of a company. Recent development in technology and the change in business environment as well as change in the nature of demand by customers has necessitated the change in the products and services offered by <b>finance</b> <b>companies.</b> Based on data from <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> listed on Bursa Malaysia over the period 2007 to 2011 this paper examined the impact of board attributes and ownership structure on the corporate strategy of <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> in Malaysia. The result indicates that expertise of directors and past performance is significant and negatively related with diversification. The study contributes to the literature on corporate governance of <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> in relation to their diversification strategy and has highlighted the corporate governance mechanisms and regulatory measures appropriate for the sector in order to enhance monitoring so as to achieve sustainable economic development.

John moved to Cardiff and shared a house with several other rugby players, including former Llanelli team mate Gerald Davies. John quit his position at Monkton House when he toured South Africa in 1968 and never taught again. On his return from Africa, John moved back to his family home at Cefneithin. He spent six weeks unemployed and during this period he considered turning to professional rugby league, almost signing for St Helens R.F.C.. Following an interview with David Coleman for the BBC programme, Sportsnight, in which his jobless situation was discussed, John was offered a job working for Forward Trust, a <b>finance</b> <b>company</b> in Cardiff.

5|$|In 1907, {{the company}} looked at using petrol-electric autocars for the {{passenger}} services, but were advised {{that they would}} not be economic, as conventional trains would still be required on Wednesdays and Saturdays to cope with the volume of traffic. However, in July 1926 they conducted trials with a Sentinel-Cammell steam railcar, which was borrowed from the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), who had absorbed the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, bought 13 steam railcars in 1926 and 1927, one of which was allocated to Goole shed for work on the Axholme Joint Railway. A similar vehicle was ordered in February 1930 specifically for the railway, and entered service in December. The steam power unit was built by the Sentinel Waggon Works in Shrewsbury, and the bodywork was built at Nottingham, at the former works of Cammell Laird, by then part of the Metropolitan-Cammell Carriage, Wagon and <b>Finance</b> <b>Company.</b> Before passenger services were withdrawn in 1933, it ran , working two return trips from Goole to Haxey Junction on weekdays, three on Wednesdays, and five on Saturdays.

50|$|The key {{difference}} between a biweekly mortgage payment plan and a traditional mortgage payment plan is that instead of making 12 full payments each year, 26 half payments--the equivalent of 13 full payments--are made each year. On a biweekly mortgage payment plan, some months will require 3 payments or 1 and one half traditional payments. <b>Finance</b> <b>companies</b> use this pattern to their advantage. <b>Finance</b> <b>companies</b> charge interest on a per diem basis instead of monthly. The consumer's repayment is scheduled on a monthly basis. This allows the <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> to collect an additional 2 weeks of interest every year. Paying biweekly payments allows consumers to eliminate the additional accrued interest charges.|$|R

5|$|After Luhti's {{arrest on}} tax fraud charges in mid-1989, several parties disputed the {{ownership}} of the team. Middlebridge Group Limited, a Japanese engineering firm owned by billionaire Koji Nakauchi, was already involved with established Formula 3000 team Middlebridge Racing and gained control of Brabham for the 1990 season. Herbie Blash had returned to run the team in 1989 and continued {{to do so in}} 1990. Middlebridge paid for its purchase using £1million loaned to them by <b>finance</b> <b>company</b> Landhurst Leasing, but the team remained underfunded and would only score a few more points finishes in its last three seasons. Jack Brabham's youngest son, David, raced for the Formula One team for a short time in 1990 including the season ending Australian Grand Prix (the first time a Brabham had driven a Brabham car in an Australian Grand Prix since 1968). 1990 was a disastrous year, with Modena's fifth place in the season opening United States Grand Prix being the only top six finish. The team finished ninth in the Constructors' Championship. Brundle and fellow Briton Mark Blundell, scored only three points during the 1991 season. Due to poor results {{in the first half of}} 1991, they had to prequalify in the second half of the season, Blundell failed to do so in Japan, as did Brundle in Australia. The team finished 10th in the Constructors' Championship, behind another struggling British team, Lotus. In 1992, Damon Hill, the son of another former Brabham driver and World Champion, debuted in the team after Giovanna Amati was dropped when her sponsorship failed to materialise. Amati was the fifth woman to attempt a Formula One race, but her three attempts were unsuccessful.|$|E

40|$|The {{allocation}} of credit by banks and <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> on “soft” terms {{to friends and}} relatives — often termed cronyism — {{rather than on the}} basis of “hard ” market criteria in the years leading up to the Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 98 has been hypothesized as an important cause of the crisis. These practices had their basis in the implicit guarantees provided by the government to banks and <b>finance</b> <b>companies,</b> which in turn percolated down to firms having “crony” ties to banks or <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> as “soft-budget constraints ” for projects of uncertain quality. Such soft-budget constraints should be reflected in preferential access to long term credit for firms with close ties to banks or <b>finance</b> <b>companies.</b> Using pre-crisis data on borrowing patterns in Thailand, we find that firms with “crony ” ties to banks or <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> had greater access to long-term debt than firms without such ties. Surprisingly, we find that a broad-range of standard firm characteristics suggested as important factors by the literature on firm finance played almost no role in explaining the {{allocation of}} long term credit. It is difficult to avoid the interpretation that “cronyism” was by far the main driver of pre-crisis lending patterns. 1...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{setting of}} private <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> that failed in New Zealand during 2006 - 2012 was {{characterized}} by weaker corporate governance and enforcement of securities law. This paper aims to explore audit failure in this setting and examine whether auditors erred in their audits of the failed <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> and whether the audit failure rate of Big N auditors was {{different from that of}} non-Big N auditors. Design/methodology/approach This paper adopts the archival research method and uses three sets of evidence to assess audit failure – the frequency of going concern opinion (GCO) prior to failure, misstatements in the last audited financial statements, and the violation of the Code of Ethics. Findings The study finds that only 41 per cent of the sample companies received the GCO in their last audit prior to failure and provides evidence of material misstatements in the financial statements of a number of failed <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> that received clean audit opinions prior to failure and breaches of the Code of Ethics by a number of auditors. These results strongly indicate audit failure for a number of failed <b>finance</b> <b>companies.</b> The audit failure rate, however, appears less for Big N auditors than for non-Big N auditors. Practical implications The study draws attention of the stock market regulator and the accounting profession to an area, the audit of private <b>finance</b> <b>companies,</b> that needs better quality audits. Originality/value This paper provides systematic evidence of audit failure in failed <b>finance</b> <b>companies</b> in New Zealand. It also furnishes preliminary evidence of Big N auditors compensating for weaker corporate governance...|$|R
