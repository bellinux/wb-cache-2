50|$|In 1944, Vaughan, Walter F. Snyder, the Director of the <b>Environment</b> <b>Sanitation</b> Program for {{the health}} {{department}} of Toledo, and Nathan Sinai, one of the School of Public Health faculty were discussing the problems concerning sanitation. At the time, there was no basic research in sanitary science, no accepted uniform sanitation standards, and many sanitation regulations conflicted with each other. They believed that the nation {{would be better if}} there was a “nationwide environmental health regulation from the collaboration of health officials and all levels of government, manufacturers producing health related equipment, users of such equipment, and institutional consultants with expert knowledge of equipment design of health protection”. With this method, they believed they will arrive with better results than through the use of ordinances, inspections, and law enforcement. From this motivation, the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), currently named NSF International, was created on October 1944. Vaughan acted as the President, Sinai as Vice President, and Snyder as Treasurer and Executive Director. With the approval of the board of regents, the University of Michigan allowed the National Sanitation Foundation and the laboratory to be operating {{in the basement of the}} Public Health Building. The NSF standardized sanitation and developed food safety requirements. During the time Vaughan was president, he held national conference, identified area of need which the program can provide assistance and gained the confidence of industries on “part of health regulatory personnel that they might rely upon the objectivity and integrity of NSF services”.|$|E

It is portrayed in half of the community having unhealthy life-style such as river usage as a place for public toilet and water for life, as well as their habit of throwing their domestic-waste directly to the river which makes it potential for any illness spread. The local government’s effort to mend this condition through settlement’s environment upgrading program through community empowerment concept, however, still unable to carry out the program well, which is the basic reason for the research. This research aims to study how the community concerns on the <b>environment</b> <b>sanitation</b> upgrading at Tanjungbalai City’s slum settlement which is done through literary research and comprehensive best practice.
