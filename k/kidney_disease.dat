5|$|There is no {{evidence}} from randomized clinical trials that treating children who have HSP with antiplatelet agent prevents persistent <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> There is also {{no evidence}} from randomized clinical trials that treating children or adults with cyclophosphamide prevents severe <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> Heparin treatment is not justified.|$|E
5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) {{of blood in the}} urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss and high blood pressure, as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

40|$|Medical {{geography}} was conceptualized {{almost ten}} years ago due to its obvious usefulness in epidemiological research. Still, numerous diseases in many regions were neglected in these aspects of research, and the prevalence of <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> in Eastern Europe is such an example. We evaluated the spatial patterns of main <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> in south-eastern Romania, and highlighted the importance of spatial modeling in medical management in Romania. We found two statistically significant hotspots of <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases</b> prevalence. We also found differences in the spatial patterns between categories of diseases. We propose {{to speed up the}} process of creating a national database of records on <b>kidney</b> <b>diseases.</b> Offering the researchers access to a national database will allow further epidemiology studies in Romania and finally lead to a better management of medical services...|$|R

5|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} polycystic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> (ADPKD), a hereditary kidney condition, {{is known}} to be associated with cerebral aneurysms in 8 percent of cases, but most such aneurysms are small and therefore unlikely to rupture. As a result, screening is only recommended in families with ADPKD where one family member has had a ruptured aneurysm.|$|E
5|$|Biopsy of {{the kidney}} may be {{performed}} both {{to establish the}} diagnosis or to assess the severity of already suspected <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> The main findings on kidney biopsy are increased cells and Ig deposition in the mesangium (part of the glomerulus, where blood is filtered), white blood cells, {{and the development of}} crescents. The changes are indistinguishable from those observed in IgA nephropathy.|$|E

5|$|In adults, kidney {{involvement}} progresses to end-stage {{renal disease}} (ESRD) more often than in children. In a UK series of 37 patients, 10 (27%) developed advanced <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> Proteinuria, hypertension at presentation, and pathology features (crescentic changes, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy) predicted progression. About 20% of children that exhibit nephrotic or nephritic features experience long permanent renal impairment.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} that preventive antibiotics decrease urinary tract infections in children is poor. However recurrent UTIs are a rare cause of further kidney problems {{if there are}} no underlying abnormalities of the kidneys, resulting in {{less than a third of}} a percent (0.33%) of chronic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> in adults.

5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt. High sodium intake {{is associated with}} a greater risk of stroke, total cardiovascular disease and <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> A reduction in sodium intake by 1,000mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent. In adults and children with no acute illness, a decrease in the intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension.|$|E
5|$|Counseling and {{guidelines}} {{on the use}} of genetic testing for HD have become models for other genetic disorders, such as autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias. Presymptomatic testing for HD has also influenced testing for other illnesses with genetic variants such as polycystic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease,</b> familial Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer. The European Molecular Genetics Quality Network have published yearly external quality assessment scheme for molecular genetic testing for this disease and have developed best practice guidelines for genetic testing for HD to assist in testing and reporting of results.|$|E

Garcia, whose annual salary was never greater than $35,000, died with more than $100,000 in outstanding medical bills.|$|E

5|$|Gout {{is partly}} genetic, {{contributing}} to about 60% of variability in uric acid level. The SLC2A9, SLC22A12 and ABCG2 genes {{have been found}} to be commonly associated with gout and variations in them can approximately double the risk. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A9 and SLC22A12 cause hereditary hypouricaemia by reducing urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion. The rare genetic disorders familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, medullary cystic <b>kidney</b> <b>disease,</b> phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency as seen in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, are complicated by gout.|$|E
