5|$|Given the chaos, the {{governor}} of Yunnan ignored the imperial orders of evacuation. The Mongol army commanded by Prince Ye-sin Timour, a grandson of the emperor, marched south toward Pagan. According to mainstream traditional (British colonial era) scholarship, the Mongol army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate; fought <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to Pagan {{with the loss of}} 7000 men; occupied the city; and sent out detachments to receive homage, one of which reached south of Prome. But not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary Mongol/Chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of Pagan or the temporary completeness of the conquest.|$|E

The highway slowly increases in elevation for about , intersecting with the western terminus of CR8 (Inavale Road) and passing a handful of farms on its way toward East Notch, a gap between two large hills that serves as Little Genesee Creek's source. It eventually turns north to traverse the pass before winding <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the opposite side. A short distance later, NY275 intersects with the northern terminus of CR8 as it curves to take a northwesterly track into the town of Friendship.|$|E
5|$|There are few native natural predators of emus still alive. Early in its species history it {{may have}} faced {{numerous}} terrestrial predators now extinct, including the giant lizard Megalania, the thylacine, and possibly other carnivorous marsupials, which may explain their seemingly well-developed ability to defend themselves from terrestrial predators. The main predator of emus today is the dingo, which was originally introduced by Aboriginals {{thousands of years ago}} from a stock of semi-domesticated wolves. Dingoes try to kill the emu by attacking the head. The emu typically tries to repel the dingo by jumping into the air and kicking or stamping the dingo on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>down.</b> The emu jumps as the dingo barely has the capacity to jump high enough to threaten its neck, so a correctly timed leap to coincide with the dingo's lunge can keep its head and neck out of danger.|$|E
5|$|A Company—now under Lieutenant Lawrence Clark {{following}} Chitts' wounding that afternoon—had {{only just}} succeeded in breaking contact from the Chinese, suffering a number killed and wounded during a confused withdrawal. Meanwhile, B Company {{had also been}} forced to fight <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the hill. Both companies were now well clear of their former positions and {{would have had a}} hard time fighting their way back. Ultimately {{it was too late for}} the Australians to regain the feature in darkness, and the weight of the Chinese attack continued to mount. Only D Company on the southern right flank—which had been left unmolested—was able to regain its previous position on Hill 63. Meanwhile, the positions previously occupied by A and B Companies were occupied by the Chinese in superior numbers, and the remainder of 3 RAR concentrated at the railway crossing instead. At 22:00 Coad arranged to shell and mortar the relinquished ridge, while a standing patrol from the Middlesex was posted on the south-western side of the Maenjung-dong pass in anticipation of a renewed Chinese attack. However, following heavy fighting the pressure on the Australians unexpectedly ceased after midnight, and parties of Chinese were observed beginning to withdraw.|$|E

25|$|The {{downtown}} {{core and}} {{much of the rest of}} Billings is in the Yellowstone Valley which is a canyon carved out by the Yellowstone River. Around 80 million years ago, the Billings area was on the shore of the Western Interior Seaway. The sea deposited sediment and sand around the shoreline. As the sea retreated it left behind a deep layer of sand. Over millions of years this sand was compressed into stone that is known as Eagle Sandstone. Over the last million years the river has carved <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> through this stone to form the canyon walls that are known as the Billings Rimrocks or the Rims.|$|E
25|$|This line {{branched}} from Anzac Parade at Alison Road, and ran {{on its own}} tram reservation beside Centennial Park as far as Darley Road.

It then ran down Perouse Road, St Pauls Street, Carr Street and Arden Street before terminating in a balloon loop in Dolphin Street, Coogee Beach. It ran through several small tram reservations on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> from Randwick to the beach. The line from the city to Randwick Racecourse opened in 1880, the first suburban extension of the system. It was extended to High Street, Randwick in 1881 (in which year the Randwick Tramway Workshops also opened) and to Coogee in 1883, and electric services were introduced in 1902. The line closed in 1960. It follows the current route of Sydney Buses' route 373.|$|E

25|$|As {{they fell}} back, the 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades left small {{groups on the}} tracks north and east of Es Salt to keep up {{intermittent}} firing until dawn. After dark, {{the remainder of the}} force withdrew through this line regiment by regiment and marched down the track during the night. The evacuation of Es Salt was completed by 02:30, but as they could only move in single file, the regiments and brigades were strung out for many miles along the track. In the dark, movement down the mountainous Umm esh Shert track was exhausting for the long column of fighting men, wounded and refugees. The column was still making <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to the Jordan Valley at daybreak. The 5th Mounted Brigade, in particular, had great difficulty moving by a terrible path; their retirement had begun at 20:30 but they did not reach Jebel Umm 'Awiya until 03:45, when the brigade came under the command of Brigadier General Cox (1st Light Horse Brigade).|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} they handed the {{scapegoat}} {{over to him}} who was to lead it away.

The escorts would not go with him up to the precipice, but watched from a distance.

25|$|Eight {{minutes into}} the second half, a high tackle by Justin Hodges on Cameron Smith close to the Broncos' line {{resulted}} in a minor scuffle and a penalty to the Storm. Melbourne captain Smith {{decided to take the}} tap and attack Brisbane's line and a close-range try to Matt King resulted. The scores were then level at 8-all, with the kick to come. Smith, also the Storm's first-choice goal-kicker, was having a problem with his kicking leg so the task fell onto Matt Geyer whose conversion attempt went wide. Ten minutes later a penalty was awarded to the Broncos after a high shot from Billy Slater on Shaun Berrigan and Corey Parker's kick was successful, giving his side a two-point lead at 10-8. Following the restart kick from Melbourne, Brisbane were working the ball out of their own half and on the fifth tackle scored a brilliant Grand Final try. From dummy-half Berrigan ran then passed back inside to Lockyer who gave a short ball on to Parker who did likewise for Casey McGuire. Before being tackled McGuire tossed the ball blindly back over his head and it was picked up by Lockyer who spun out of a tackle then passed it to Tonie Carroll. Without losing momentum, Carroll passed the ball on to a flying Brent Tate who raced to the corner for the try. The conversion attempt from near the sideline was missed by Parker so the Broncos led by six with seventeen minutes of play remaining. A couple of minutes later the Storm appeared to have scored their third try when a bomb by Cronk was leapt for but unsuccessfully taken by both a Brisbane and a Melbourne player. On <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the ball was snatched from the air by King who looked to have put it down for his second try but the video referee ruled that the ball had gone forward off the Storm so it was disallowed. In the seventy-third minute, after a strong run by prop Shane Webcke (the oldest player on the field) put him in good field position, Lockyer snapped away a successful field goal. This gave the Broncos a 7-point buffer. A frustrated Melbourne side were unable to score in the remaining minutes as Brisbane ground their way towards full-time, the score 15-8 at the final siren.|$|E

500|$|As {{a fairly}} rare phenomenon, the {{formation}} of geysers is due to particular hydrogeological conditions that exist {{in only a few}} places on Earth.
