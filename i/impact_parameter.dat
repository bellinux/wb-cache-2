That leads to special features of their spatial interaction region at these and higher ener- gies. Within the framework of some phenomenological models, we show how the particular ranges of the transferred momenta measured in elastic scattering experiments expose the spatial features of the in- elastic interaction region according to the unitarity condition. The difference between their predictions at higher energies is discussed.
