Such studies have been undertaken for every level of language, from phonetics to pragmatics, and for almost every current teaching methodology. It is therefore impossible to summarize their findings here. However, some more <b>general</b> <b>issues</b> have been addressed.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} of Native Americans in the United States has been problematic since the initial European colonization of the Americas.

25|$|However, {{during the}} 1998 tour of Pakistan, {{the issue was}} again raised, as the Government of Pakistan had {{initiated}} a separate judicial inquiry into <b>general</b> <b>issues</b> regarding {{the performance of the}} Pakistani team and allegations of illegal betting by past and former players.

25|$|Under the Military Reconstruction Act, Congress {{declared}} Arkansas {{restored to}} the Union in June 1868, after the Legislature accepted the 14th Amendment. The Republican-controlled reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage (though temporarily disfranchising former Confederate Army officers, who were all Democrats), a public education system for blacks and whites, and passed <b>general</b> <b>issues</b> to improve the state and help more of the population. The State soon came under control of the Radical Republicans and Unionists, and led by Governor Powell Clayton, they presided over {{a time of great}} upheaval as Confederate sympathizers and the Ku Klux Klan fought the new developments, particularly voting rights for African Americans.|$|E
25|$|He usually {{refrained from}} {{intervening}} {{directly into the}} political debate while serving as President. However, he often addressed <b>general</b> <b>issues,</b> without mentioning their connection to the current political debate, in order to state his opinion without being too intrusive. His interventions have frequently {{stressed the need for}} all parties to respect the constitution and observe the proprieties of political debate. He was generally held in high regard by all political forces represented in the parliament. The possibility of persuading Ciampi to stand for a second term as President – the so-called Ciampi-bis – was widely discussed, despite his advancing age, but it was officially dismissed by Ciampi himself on 3 May 2006, just a few days before his mandate expired. Ciampi resigned as President before the swearing-in ceremony of his successor, Giorgio Napolitano.|$|E
500|$|In {{keeping with}} the <b>general</b> <b>issues</b> of {{reptiles}}, some of the U.S. state reptiles are dwindling species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) maintains a system of ratings, going from Extinct to Least Concern. None of the U.S. state reptiles are in the most extreme categories of Extinct, Extinct in the Wild, or Critically Endangered. Two species are IUCN Endangered: the Alabama red-bellied turtle (Alabama) and the loggerhead sea turtle (South Carolina, also the state saltwater reptile of Florida). However, in the United States, only the Alabama red-bellied turtle is legally an endangered species. The loggerhead sea turtle is only considered [...] "threatened" [...] under U.S. regulations.|$|E

500|$|Persistent public {{demand for}} the new coins {{prompted}} Woodbury to contact Patterson, requesting more silver dollars. In 1838, the design was modified to remove the stars from the reverse. [...] Throughout the production run, {{a number of different}} Gobrecht dollar patterns, which differed from the <b>general</b> <b>issues,</b> were struck. A small number were struck bearing the date of 1838 that did not bear Gobrecht's initials in any form. In total, 300 dollars of this type dated 1839 were struck for circulation, all in medal alignment. Patterson's trial issue had evidently been a success, as full-scale production of the Seated Liberty dollar began in 1840. The Seated Liberty dollar utilized an obverse design based on that of the Gobrecht dollar, though the reverse was altered from a soaring to a heraldic eagle.|$|E
2500|$|The Student Association is the University of Tulsa student {{government}} body. It is organized into three branches: the Executive Branch, which includes Cabinet {{and is in}} charge of organizing large campus-wide events and activities; the Judicial Branch; and the Legislative Branch, or Student Senate, which coordinates funding, supports student organization charters, and addresses <b>general</b> <b>issues</b> impacting student life on campus. Its budget is provided partially by the university and partially by a fee paid by students each semester.|$|E

2500|$|Shahn’s biographer Soby notes [...] "the {{composition}} of the mural at Roosevelt follows the undulant principle Shahn had learned from Diego Rivera: deep recession of space alternating with human and architectural details projected forward." [...] Moreover, the montage effectively intimates the amalgamation of peoples and cultures populating the urban landscape in the early 20th century. Multiple layers and perspectives fuse together to portray a complex industrialized system. Still, the mural maintains a sense of humanity; Shahn gives his figures a monumental quality through volume and scale. The urban architecture does not dwarf the people; instead, they work with the surroundings {{to build their own}} structure. Shahn captured the urgency for activism and reform, by showing gestures and mid-steps and freezing all the subjects in motion. This pictorial incorporation of [...] "athletic pose and evocative asymmetry of architectural detail" [...] is a Shahn trademark. While exemplifying his visual and social concerns, the mural characterizes the <b>general</b> <b>issues</b> of Shahn's milieu.|$|E
2500|$|Daniel Pipes {{identified}} {{other more}} <b>general</b> <b>issues</b> {{in the book}} likely to have angered pious Muslims: A complaint in the book by one of Mahound's companions: [...] "rules about every damn thing, if a man farts let him turn {{his face to the}} wind, a rule about which hand to use for the purpose of cleaning one's behind ...", which was said to mix up [...] "Islamic law with its opposite and with the author's whimsy"; the prophet of Rushdie's novel, as he lies dying, being visited in a dream by the Goddess Allat, on the grounds that this suggested either that she exists or that the prophet thought she did; the angel Gibreel's vision of the Supreme Being in another dream as [...] "not abstract in the least. He saw, sitting on the bed, a man of {{about the same age as}} himself", balding, wearing glasses and [...] "seeming to suffer from dandruff". A complaint by one of the characters about communal violence in India: [...] "Fact is, religious faith, which encodes the highest aspirations of human race, is now, in our country, the servant of lowest instincts, and God is the creature of evil".|$|E
2500|$|Twitter {{was criticized}} for its {{inability}} to respond quickly and prevent harassment over the service. Within the United States, Twitter and other social media sites are not liable for content posted by third-parties of their service under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (1996), and so have no legal obligation to police malicious content such as harassment and threats. Brianna Wu, shortly after becoming a target of harassment, stated that Twitter facilitated harassment by {{the ease with which}} anyone could make a new account even after having an earlier account blocked, and challenged the service to improve its responsiveness to complaints. Robinson Meyer of The Atlantic said Gamergate is an [...] "identity crisis" [...] for Twitter, and by not dealing with harassing users, the platform is failing to protect victims. Early in the Gamergate controversy, software developer Randi Harper started the [...] "Good Game Auto Blocker" [...] or [...] "ggautoblocker", an expanding list of known Twitter accounts that were tied to the Gamergate hashtag which could be automatically blocked, therefore reducing the degree of harassment received. In November 2014, Twitter announced a collaboration with the non-profit group [...] "Women, Action & the Media" [...] (WAM), in which users of Twitter can report harassment to a tool monitored by WAM members, who would forward affirmed issues to Twitter within 24 hours. The move, while {{in the wake of the}} Gamergate harassment, was due to <b>general</b> <b>issues</b> of the harassment of women on the Internet. In May 2015, WAM reported that of 512 reported harassment instances by the tool during the month of November 2014, 12% of those were tied to the Gamergate controversy based on the ggautoblocker list, with most harassment occurring from single-instance accounts targeting a single person.|$|E

60|$|Modification {{has come}} to the average home {{tradition}} through two distinct, though no doubt finally interdependent channels. The first of these channels is the channel of changing economic necessities, using the phrase to cover everything from domestic conveniences at the one extreme to the financial foundation of the home at the other, and the next is the influx of new systems of thought, of feeling, and of interpretation about the <b>general</b> <b>issues</b> of life.|$|E
60|$|Here is {{a system}} of motives and passions, {{imperious}} and powerful, which follows no broad general rule and in which each man must needs be a light unto himself upon innumerable issues. I am satisfied that these personal urgencies are neither to be suppressed nor crudely nor ruthlessly subordinated to the <b>general</b> <b>issues.</b> Religious and moral teachers are apt to make this part of life either too detached or too insignificant. They teach it either as {{if it did not}} matter or as if it ought not to matter. Indeed our individual friends and enemies stand between us and hide or interpret for us all the larger things. Few of us can even worship alone. We must feel others, and those not strangers, kneeling beside us.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{told that}} our opponents, putting aside the great and <b>general</b> <b>issues</b> upon which I have had the honour to address you, attempt to gain support by {{entering}} upon a crusade--to my mind a most pernicious crusade--against the law of compulsory vaccination. I am not concerned to defend that law, because practically {{in the mind of}} all reasonable men it stands beyond attack. It is, I am told, suggested that the Act should be amended by freeing from the usual penalties any parent who chooses to advance a plea of conscientious objection against the vaccination of his children. Such an argument seems to me too puerile, I had almost said too wicked, to dwell upon, for in its issue it would mean that at the whim of individuals innocent children might be exposed to disease, disfigurement, and death, and the whole community through them to a very real and imminent danger. Prophecy is dangerous, but, speaking for myself as a private member of Parliament, I can scarcely believe that responsible ministers of any party, moved by the pressure of an ill-informed and erroneous opinion, would ever consent under this elastic plea of conscience to establish such a precedent of surrender. Vaccination with its proved benefits is outside the pale of party. After long and careful study, science and the medical profession have given a verdict in its favour, a verdict which has now been confirmed by the experience of generations. Here I leave the question, and, turning once more before I sit down to those great and <b>general</b> <b>issues</b> of which I have already spoken, I would again impress upon this vast audience, and through it upon the constituency at large," [...] etc., etc., etc.|$|E
