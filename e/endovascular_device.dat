40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the criteria {{that would make}} use of an <b>endovascular</b> <b>device</b> cost-effective compared with bypass surgery and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty {{in the treatment of}} femoropopliteal arterial disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision model was developed to compare treatment {{with the use of a}} hypothetical <b>endovascular</b> <b>device</b> with established therapies. Cost-effectiveness from the perspective of the health care system was considered. Outcome measures were lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years. With the use of net health benefit calculations and threshold analysis, combinations of costs and patency rates were determined that would make the device cost-effective compared with established therapies. In subgroup and sensitivity analyses, the effect on decision-making of sex, age, indication, lesion type, procedural risk, and society's willingness to pay for incremental gain in health were explored. RESULTS: Use of a device that costs $ 3, 000 would be cost-effective compared with bypass surgery for critical ischemia if the 5 -year patency rate is 29 %- 46 %. Use of the same device would be cost-effective compared with angioplasty for disabling claudication and stenosis if the 5 -year patency rate is 69 %- 86 %.

40|$|Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) {{has emerged}} as a promising, less {{invasive}} alternative to conventional open surgery for the treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). In the last 20 years, the application rate of EVAR and its clinical results have significantly improved thanks to the evolution of stent-grafts and endovascular delivery systems. However, further development is still needed to reduce the incidence of complications and secondary re-interventions. The Treovance abdominal aortic stent-graft (Bolton Medical, Barcelona, Spain) is a new-generation <b>endovascular</b> <b>device,</b> developed to increase flexibility, lower profile, improve deployment and sealing mechanisms. In particular, it is provided with some innovative features as a double layer of proximal barbs (suprarenal and infrarenal) for supplemental fixation, dull barbs between modules to avoid potential leg disconnections, detachable outer sheath provided with a new-design hemostatic valve, and a double improved mechanism (slow motion and "pin and pull") for precise stent-graft deployment. A European prospective, non-randomized, multi-institutional, "first-in-human" trial (the ADVANCE trial) was conducted from March to December 2011 to assess the safety and performance of the Treovance stent-graft system before commercialization. Thirty patients with anatomically suitable non-ruptured AAAs were enrolled at five clinical sites in Italy, Spain, and Germany. EVAR was completed successfully in all patients. The stent-graft was delivered and deployed safely even in heavily angulated or calcified anatomies. No 30 -day device-related complications nor deaths were observed.

These devices range from coronary stents to full aortic valve replacement and are delivered through the vascular system. Usability engineering is a sub specialty of ergonomics concerned with the development of devices that are fit for use (Kramme et al. 2011). Usability Testing (UT) of medical devices {{is an integral part of}} the regulatory requirements for device approval in both the United States and the European Union. UT champions the use of simulated use testing, particularly at the early stage and validation stage of the design process (FDA 2011). Simulated UT is a safe and ethical way of eliciting user needs, testing device prototypes, and validating design solutions in order to reduce the likelihood of an adverse event occurring. During UT, there is an onus on the tester to provide operators with a sufficient level of fidelity so as to cause a ‘suspension of disbelief’ during the task (Halamek et al. 2000); that is, that the operator thinks and feels like they are performing in the real environment. Currently, UT of <b>endovascular</b> medical <b>devices</b> is undertaken in pulsatile flow rigs with hollow silicone anatomical models and direct visualisation of devices in the model.
