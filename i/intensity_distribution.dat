5|$|To {{overcome}} these challenges, researchers have employed various solutions. Astronomical interferometry, first conceived by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1868, was the seminal concept that has enabled major improvements in modern telescopy {{and led to}} the creation of the Michelson interferometer in the 1880s, and the first successful measurement of Betelgeuse. Just as human depth perception increases when two eyes instead of one perceive an object, Fizeau proposed the observation of stars through two apertures instead of one to obtain interferences that would furnish information on the star's spatial <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution.</b> The science evolved quickly and multiple-aperture interferometers are now used to capture speckled images, which are synthesized using Fourier analysis to produce a portrait of high resolution. It was this methodology that identified the hotspots on Betelgeuse in the 1990s. Other technological breakthroughs include adaptive optics, space observatories like Hipparcos, Hubble and Spitzer, and the Astronomical Multi-BEam Recombiner (AMBER), which combines the beams of three telescopes simultaneously, allowing researchers to achieve milliarcsecond spatial resolution.|$|E

2500|$|The XTI {{technique}} {{is based on}} the Talbot effect or [...] "self-imaging phenomenon", which is a Fresnel diffraction effect and leads to repetition of a periodic wavefront after a certain propagation distance, called the [...] "Talbot length". This periodic wavefront can be generated by spatially coherent illumination of a periodic structure, like a diffraction grating, and if so the <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution</b> of the wave field at the Talbot length resembles exactly the structure of the grating and is called a self-image. It has also been shown that intensity patterns will be created at certain fractional Talbot lengths. At half the distance the same <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution</b> appears except for a lateral shift of half the grating period while at certain smaller fractional Talbot distances the self-images have fractional periods and fractional sizes of the intensity maxima and minima, that become visible in the <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution</b> behind the grating, a so-called Talbot carpet. The Talbot length and the fractional lengths can be calculated by knowing the parameters of the illuminating radiation and the illuminated grating and thus gives the exact position of the intensity maxima, which needs to be measured in GBI. While the Talbot effect and the Talbot interferometer were discovered and extensively studied by using visible light it has been demonstrated several years ago for the hard X-ray regime as well.|$|E

Here he formulates the semiclassical formulation in a manner quite similar to its modern form. The first joint reference to both Franck and Condon in regards to the new principle appears in the same 1926 issue of Physical Review in an article on the band structure of carbon monoxide by Raymond Birge.|$|E

The present investigation is concerned with the employment of such a scanning procedure for the recording and the reproduction of microwave holograms.

2500|$|From spectra with {{rotational}} resolution, {{moments of}} inertia and hence bond lengths and angles {{can be determined}} [...] "directly" [...] (at least in principle). From less well-resolved spectra one can still determine important quantities like JT stabilization energies and energy barriers (e.g. to pseudorotation). However, in the whole spectral <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution</b> [...] of an electronic transition more information is encoded. It {{has been used to}} decide on the presence (or absence) of the geometric phase which is accumulated during the pseudorotational motion around the JT (or other type of) conical intersection. Prominent examples of either type are the ground (X) or an excited (B) state of Na3. The Fourier transform of , the so-called autocorrelation function [...] reflects the motion of the wavepacket after an optical (= vertical) transition to the APES of the final electronic state. Typically it will move on the timescale of a vibrational period which is (for small molecules) of the order of 5-50 fs, i.e. ultrafast. Besides a nearly periodic motion, mode-mode interactions with very irregular (also chaotic) behaviour and spreading of the wavepacket may also occur. Near a conical intersection this will be accompanied/complemented by nonradiative transitions (termed internal conversion) to other APESs occurring on the same ultrafast time scale.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} imaging mode {{collects}} low-energy (<50 eV) secondary electrons that are {{ejected from the}} k-shell of the specimen atoms by inelastic scattering interactions with beam electrons. Due to their low energy, these electrons originate within a few nanometers from the sample surface. The electrons are detected by an Everhart-Thornley detector, which {{is a type of}} scintillator-photomultiplier system. The secondary electrons are first collected by attracting them towards an electrically biased grid at about +400 V, and then further accelerated towards a phosphor or scintillator positively biased to about +2,000 V. The accelerated secondary electrons are now sufficiently energetic to cause the scintillator to emit flashes of light (cathodoluminescence), which are conducted to a photomultiplier outside the SEM column via a light pipe and a window in the wall of the specimen chamber. The amplified electrical signal output by the photomultiplier is displayed as a two-dimensional <b>intensity</b> <b>distribution</b> that can be viewed and photographed on an analogue video display, or subjected to analog-to-digital conversion and displayed and saved as a digital image. This process relies on a raster-scanned primary beam. The brightness of the signal depends on the number of secondary electrons reaching the detector. If the beam enters the sample perpendicular to the surface, then the activated region is uniform about the axis of the beam and a certain number of electrons [...] "escape" [...] from within the sample. As the angle of incidence increases, the interaction volume increases and the [...] "escape" [...] distance of one side of the beam decreases, resulting in more secondary electrons being emitted from the sample. Thus steep surfaces and edges tend to be brighter than flat surfaces, which results in images with a well-defined, three-dimensional appearance. Using the signal of secondary electrons image resolution less than 0.5nbsp&nm is possible.|$|E
