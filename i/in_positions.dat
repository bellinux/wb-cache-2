5|$|With {{the removal}} of Constantine VI, Irene {{henceforth}} reigned alone, the first Byzantine empress to do so. Staurakios, however, found his own position increasingly challenged by another powerful eunuch and trusted servant of the empress, Aetios. Both were engaged in an intense rivalry to place their relatives <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> of power so as to secure control of the Empire after Irene's death.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all of the}} fifty-five delegates {{had taken}} part in the Revolution, with at least twenty-nine having served in the Continental forces, most <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> of command. All but two or three had served in colonial or state {{government}} during their careers. The vast majority (about 75%) of the delegates were or had been members of the Confederation Congress, and many had been members of the Continental Congress during the Revolution. Several had been state governors. Just two delegates, Roger Sherman and Robert Morris, would be signatories {{to all three of}} the nation's founding documents: the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{proclamation}} of independence, neither the Belgian nor the Congolese government intended the colonial social order to end immediately. The Belgian government hoped that whites might keep their position indefinitely. The Republic of the Congo was still reliant on colonial {{institutions like the}} Force Publique to function from day to day, and white technical experts, installed by the Belgians, were retained in the broad absence of suitably qualified black Congolese replacements (partly the result of colonial restrictions regarding higher education). Many Congolese people had assumed that independence would produce tangible and immediate social change, so the retention of whites <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> of importance was widely resented.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the Civil War, Gwyn resumed the life he had left behind in 1861. He returned home to his wife Margaret and daughters Elizabeth and Matilda, now five years older than the last time he saw them. He applied for his military pension on October 6, 1866. Though Gwyn served <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> with a difficulty as high as major general, because he was only brevet, the payment he received would be reduced to the level of his highest non-brevet rank; which would be colonel, the position he effectively gave up on October 14, 1864.|$|E

The second part of qualifying lasted 15 minutes and eliminated cars that finished <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> 11 to 17.

5|$|Though {{the mosque}} had regained its {{standing}} in Cairo, repairs and additional work {{were carried out}} by those <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> lower than sultan. This changed {{under the rule of}} al-Zahir Barquq, the first sultan of the Burji dynasty. The resumption of direct patronage by those in the highest positions of government continued through to the end of Mamluk rule. Improvements and additions were made by the sultans Qaytbay and Qansuh al-Ghuri, each of whom oversaw numerous repairs and erected minarets. It was common practice among the Mamluk sultans to build minarets, perceived as symbols of power and the most effective way of cementing one's position in the Cairo cityscape. The sultans wished to have a noticeable association with the prestigious al-Azhar.|$|E

He said later that he could not continue to live in Israel because the same men who had, in his view, betrayed the Jewish community in Hungary were now <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> of power there. In 1960 he moved instead to England, where he worked for two years in the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit in Carshalton, Surrey, and seven years for the Medical Research Council.

5|$|Yardley {{had a good}} {{technique}} for batting. He possessed a fluent, attractive style, and his height allowed him to reach the ball and drive more comfortably than most. His best shots were on the leg side, using his strong wrists to turn the ball away when it was aimed towards his legs. Yardley performed best when his side was in difficulty, and he could play attacking or defensive innings depending on the situation. He bowled intelligently, leading to greater rewards than his gentle style led opponents to expect, but remained a reluctant bowler who was surprised by his own success. He was a good fielder <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> close to the batsmen.|$|E
5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers {{and their relatives}} and friends. Soliciting employment from those <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.|$|E
5|$|By 20:00 {{that evening}} {{a large number}} of South Koreans were {{retreating}} in disarray through a gap in the line held by the brigade, the majority of them moving through the Australians. The South Korean 6th Division later regrouped <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> behind 27th Brigade, but was now reduced to less than half its original strength. Meanwhile, as the 20th Army veered to the west as part of the Chinese main effort against Seoul, the Chinese 118th Division continued its secondary advance down the Kapyong Valley, closely pursuing the retreating South Koreans. Racing down the northeast running valley, the 354th Regiment reached the Australian positions by about 22:00. Intent on capturing the important crossroads of Route 17 south of Kapyong, and most likely unaware of the location of the Australian blocking position, the Chinese vanguard remained in the low ground, splitting as they approached a long, low north-south running ridge that rose like an island in the mouth of the valley.|$|E

5|$|During the {{previous}} night, the German and Ottoman force evacuated Katia and was moving towards Oghratina when Chauvel ordered the Anzac Mounted Division {{to continue the}} attack. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades and the 5th Mounted Brigade were ordered to capture Oghratina. Despite attempts by these two brigades to turn the enemy flank, {{they were forced to}} make a frontal attack on strongly entrenched rearguards <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> which favoured the defenders and which were supported by carefully positioned artillery. Meanwhile, the two infantry divisions moved to garrison Katia and Abu Hamra and Lawrence moved his headquarters forward from Kantara to Romani.

5|$|On {{the west}} side of the Naktong, North Korean Major General Pak Kyo Sam, {{commanding}} the NK 9th Division, issued his operations order to the division on August 28. Its mission in the forthcoming attack was to outflank and destroy the US troops at Naktong Bulge by capturing the Miryang and Samnangjin areas to cut off the US 2nd Division's route of supply and withdrawal between Taegu and Pusan. However, the North Koreans were not aware that the US 2nd Infantry Division had recently replaced the US 24th Infantry Division <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> along the Naktong River. Consequently, they expected lighter resistance; the 24th troops were exhausted from months of fighting but the 2nd Division men were fresh and newly arrived in Korea. They had only recently been moved into the line. The North Koreans began crossing the Naktong River under cover of darkness at certain points.|$|E
