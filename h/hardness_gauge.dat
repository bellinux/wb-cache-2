Foram utilizadas 80 amostras divididas em 4 grupos de variáveis, com 5 repetições cada variável, nos períodos de tempo de 1 hora, 1 dia, 1 semana e 1 mês. Para a confecção das amostras foi utilizada uma matriz retangular de alumínio incluída em mufla, cujo molde impresso no gesso foi preenchido com resina acrílica. Após polimerizadas, as amostras divididas em dois grupos foram polidas pelos processos de polimento químico e convencional. Em seguida, foram armazenadas em água destilada a 37 °C durante os períodos de tempo propostos. Decorrido o período de armazenagem, as amostras foram submetidas aos testes de Rugosidade Superficial, num rugosímetro Praxis (Rug- 3); Resistência ao Impacto, numa máquina OTTO Wolpert Werke (Sistema Charpy); e Dureza, com penetrômetro Durimet. A análise estatística dos dados de rugosidade {{superficial}} revelou diferença entre as resinas quando polidas de modo convencional apenas no período de armazenagem de 1 mês. No polimento químico, em todos os períodos de armazenagem, com superioridade estatística para os valores apresentados pela resina acrílica ativada quimicamente com polimento químico em todos os períodos de armazenagem e com polimento convencional no período de armazenagem de 1 mês. Para ambas resinas, os melhores valores foram obtidos com o polimento convencional em todos os períodos de armazenagem. Com relação à resistência ao impacto, a análise estatística revelou semelhança entre as resinas quando polidas de maneira convencional, apenas no período de armazenagem de 1 mês, e no polimento químico, em todos os períodos de armazenagem, com superioridade estatística para os valores apresentados pela resina acrílica ativada quimicamente, com polimento convencional nos períodos de 1 hora, 1 dia e 1 semana de armazenagem. Para a resina acrílica ativada termicamente, o polimento químico apresentou valores superiores estatisticamente nos períodos de 1 hora, 1 dia e 1 mês de armazenagem, e para a resina acrílica ativada quimicamente, nos períodos de 1 hora e 1 mês de armazenagem. A análise estatística dos dados de Dureza revelou diferença entre as resinas quando polidas de maneira convencional, com superioridade para a resina acrílica ativada termicamente com 1 dia de armazenagem, e para a resina acrílica ativada quimicamente com 1 mês de armazenagem. Com polimento químico, a resina acrílica ativada termicamente apresentou superioridade estatística apenas nos períodos de 1 dia e 1 semana de armazenagem. Para a resina acrílica ativada termicamente, foi apresentada diferença estatística entre os polimentos apenas no período de armazenagem de 1 dia, com superioridade para o polimento convencional. Para a resina acrílica ativada quimicamente, o polimento convencional apresentou valores superiores estatisticamente em todos os períodos de armazenagemAbstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate the effect of chemical polishing on the hardness, surface roughness and impact resistance of the self-cured acrylic resin and conventional heat-cured acrylic resins, in various storage times. Eight specimens were used divided into four variable groups with tive repetitions each one, in the following periods of time: 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week and 1 month. To make specimens, a rectangular matrix of aluminium included into flask was used, whose mold printed on the gypsum was fulfilled with acrylic resin. After curing, the specimens divided into two groups were polished with chemical and conventional polishing. Thereafter, they were stored in distilled water at 37 °C during the periods proposed. Elapsed the period of storage, the specimens were submitted to the tests of surface roughness in the Praxis (Rug- 3) roughness gauge; impact resistance in the testing machine OTTO Wolpert Werke (Charpy System); and hardness with Durimet <b>hardness</b> <b>gauge.</b> The statistical analysis of the surface roughness data revealed difference between the resins when polished in the conventional manner only in a storage period of 1 month. On the chemical polishing, this difference was obselVed in all the periods of the storage, with statistical superiority for the values obtained with chemical polishing in all the periods of the storage and with conventional polishing in a storage period of 1 month. For both the self-cured and heat-cured acrylic resins, the best values were obtained with the conventional polishing in all the periods of the storage. Regarding the impact resistance, the statistical analysis revealed similarity between the resins when poIished in the conventional manner, only in a storage period of 1 month, and in the chemical polishing, in all the periods of the storage, with statistical superiority for the values obtained for the self-cured acrylic resin, with conventional polishing in a storage period of 1 hour, 1 day and 1 week. For the heat-cured acrylic resin, the chemical poIi. shing showed values with statistical superiority in a storage period of 1 hour, 1 day and 1 month, and for the self-cured acrylic resin, in a storage period of I hour and 1 month. The data statistical analysis of the hardness revealed difference between the resins when polished in the conventional manner, with superiority for the heat-cured acrylic resin with a storage period of 1 day, and for the self-cured acrylic resin, with a storage period of 1 month. With the chemical polishing, the heat-cured acrylic resin showed statistical superiority only in a storage period of 1 day and 1 week. For the heat-cured acrylic resin, a difference between the polishings was showed only in a storage period of 1 day, with superiority for the conventional polishing. For the self-cured acrylic resin, the conventional polishing showed values with statistical superiority in alI the periods of the storag...|$|E
5|$|The hardest natural {{diamonds}} mostly {{originate from}} the Copeton and Bingara fields {{located in the}} New England area in New South Wales, Australia. These diamonds are generally small, perfect to semiperfect octahedra, and are used to polish other diamonds. Their hardness {{is associated with the}} crystal growth form, which is single-stage crystal growth. Most other diamonds show more evidence of multiple growth stages, which produce inclusions, flaws, and defect planes in the crystal lattice, all of which affect their hardness. It is possible to treat regular diamonds under a combination of high pressure and high temperature to produce diamonds that are harder than the diamonds used in <b>hardness</b> <b>gauges.</b>|$|R
40|$|Hardness, Strength and Ductility are {{the most}} {{important}} material physical properties which are interrelated. Generally, hardness can be readily measured and it is directly proportional to Strength and inversely to the Ductility. Hardness simply {{is a measure of the}} resistance to deformation or penetration. It is well understood that hardness measurement / verification plays a vital role, not only during the normal Quality Control (QC) checks but more importantly during metallurgical failure investigation process, as hardness virtually speaks a lot about material properties. The very first scientific attempt in hardness measurements was comparing the object hardness against a set of selected stones with varied surface hardness. Currently, there are several established techniques to assess metal hardness both in laboratories and in the field, and also in both micro and macro ranges. The hardness is measured in several different Units, characteristic to each measuring technique, and hence, no single unit can be universally adopted. Thus the hardness conversion charts and/or factors become very essential information for comparison purpose. Most of the modern field <b>hardness</b> <b>gauges</b> employ bouncing ball methodology to measure the metal’s macro hardness and the manufacturer provided Conversion Charts are made available or Conversion Logics ar...|$|R
40|$|E 911 creep samples {{exposed to}} {{temperatures}} of 600 ˚C, 625 ˚C and 650 ˚C at differing stress levels were supplied by CORUS. The <b>hardness</b> of the <b>gauge</b> length that experienced both creep strain and temperature {{was found to}} be lower than that of the head where thermal softening only can be assumed. The changes in the morphology and size of precipitates were observed qualitatively by optical microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy. A creep fracture mechanism map of E 911 steel was constructed with two modes of creep (transgranular and intergranular). A fitted ellipse shape was used to characterise the irregular block shape by Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD). It showed that the width of the block inside a prior austenite grain increases more rapidly in the gauge length than in the head; subgrain growth was also observed by EBSD. Transmission Electron Microscopy studies indicate that at 600 °C E 911 steel can reach up to 75647 hours creep rupture life (108 MPa), which is due to the relatively small size of M 23 C 6, Laves and M 2 X phases. However, Z phase precipitation results in a drop in creep resistance owing to the dissolution of fine MX phase and the transformation of M 2 X phase. At 625 °C and 650 °C, the creep rupture life decreases owing to the coarsening of Laves, M 23 C 6 and M 2 X phases. Four experimental steel casts were prepared with varying levels of Ni and Cr to investigate the effect of these elements on Z phase formation. After 10, 000 hours exposure, there was little evidence of Z phase in the samples studied and therefore it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the role of Ni or Cr in promoting Z phase formation. It is possible that the casts studied here will allow better conclusions to be drawn after exposing the samples to longer durations. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|In this PRISMA project new {{cellular}} materials {{will be developed}} by a gel casting technique. The process was initially set up to produce dense ceramics, andwill be adapted in a second stage {{to the formation of}} cellular solids {{with the addition of a}} pore forming agent (poly(ethylene)), which decomposes during thermal treatment at high temperature, leaving calibrated porosities. Commercial ZrO 2 powders (Tosoh TZ- 3 Y and TZ- 3 YS, 3 mol % Y 2 O 3) as a ceramic material and gelatine as a gelling agent were employed. Selected powders were preliminary characterised by Transmission Electron Microscopy (BF and SADP), in order to acquire information about size distribution and microstructure. The first step of the work was the optimisation of the zirconia suspension with respect to its stability, because while the gelling process is occurring there should be no powder sedimentation. The best results were obtained bywith dispersing the powders in distilled water under natural pH (ca. 4. 7) and after 10 minutes of sonication by means of an u. s. probe, as evidenced by laser granulometry. Then, slurries with varying solid/liquid ratios and various amounts of gelatine were prepared. The influence of the dispersion method, of the temperature of gelatine dissolution and of casting, gelation and drying conditions were studied. In particular, an increase of the viscosity of the suspension was observed with the TZ- 3 Y powder, which made the casting very difficult, then this powder was given up. The best results were reached with a solid content of 50 wt% and a gelatine content of 3 wt. % respect to the water amount. Knoop micro-hardness technique, performed on a section carefully cut and polished, was used to investigate the effectiveness of the drying phase: differences in hardness between surface and core were found, possibly as a consequence of differential drying rate which involves an internal gradient of density, useful for an effective comparison between different drying procedures. Density measurements by Archimede’s principle on fired samples at 1400 °C for 1 hour indicated that it was possible to reach at least 95 % t. d [...] Then, poly(ethylene) granules (125 - 300 microns) were added to create porosities inside the gel cast pieces (50 vol. %). The thermal cycle was set up to allow the polymer to decompose, without foam collapsing prior to high temperature sintering. Dense products were machined to the final standard size of 10 x 30 mm for cylinders and 4 x 3 x 50 mm for prismatic bars, obtaining parallel planar surfaces and removing surface defects such as voids and irregular profiles. Samples were tested for mechanical properties by means of Instron 8033 (200 kN) and Zwick Roell Z 010 (10 kN) electromechanical testing machines. Uniaxial compressive strength was measured on cylinders, tensile strength and elastic modulus were measured by four points bending test on prismatic samples equipped with strain <b>gauges.</b> <b>Hardness</b> and fracture toughness of bulk samples were finally evaluated by Vickers micro-hardness testing adopting models available in literature...|$|R
