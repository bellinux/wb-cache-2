5000|$|Five {{classes of}} visual {{pigmentation}} {{are found in}} vertebrates. All but one of these developed prior to the divergence of cyclometers and fish. [...] Various adaptations within these five classes give rise to suitable eyes depending on the spectrum encountered. As light travels through water, longer wavelengths, such as reds and yellows, are absorbed more quickly than the shorter wavelengths of the greens and blues. This can create a gradient of light types as the depth of water increases. The visual receptors in fish are {{more sensitive to the}} range of light present in their <b>habitat</b> <b>level.</b> However, this phenomenon does not occur in land environments, creating little variation in pigment sensitivities among terrestrial vertebrates. The homogeneous nature of the pigment sensitivities directly contributes to the significant presence of communication colors. This presents distinct selective advantages, such as better recognition of predators, food, and mates. Indeed, it is thought that simple sensory-neural mechanisms may selectively control general behavior patterns, such as escape, foraging, and hiding. Many examples of wavelength-specific behavior patterns have been identified, in two primary groups: less than 450 nm, associated with natural light sources, and greater than 450 nm, associated with reflected light sources. As opsin molecules were subtly fine-tuned to detect different wavelengths of light, at some point color vision developed when photo-receptor cells developed multiple pigments. As a chemical adaption rather than a mechanical one, this may have occurred at any of {{the early stages of the}} eye's evolution, and the capability may have disappeared and reappeared as organisms became predator or prey. Similarly, night and day vision emerged when receptors differentiated into rods and cones, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Fish assemblages along marine {{artificial}} reefs {{have been}} the objects of numerous studies. Most of them distinguish resident from transient species according to their <b>habitat</b> association <b>level.</b> Despite its wide use, this distinction presents practical complications for two main reasons: first, the method used for assessing <b>habitat</b> association <b>level</b> may cause mistakes, and second, no objective method has been proposed thus far to determine the <b>habitat</b> association <b>level</b> {{that should be considered}} as a boundary between resident and transient species. This paper aims at overcoming these two problems. In order to improve and standardize assessment of <b>habitat</b> association <b>level,</b> we developed a habitat association index (HAI) whose calculation requires only presence-absence data. By taking into account both species occurrence rate and occurrence patterns, our index minimizes the risk of erroneously perceiving species as being equally associated to a habitat. In order to distinguish between resident and transient species objectively, we propose to plot HAI against occurrence rate and then seek the combination providing the most significantly different groups with reference to the relation between these two variables. Using two different datasets collected along Japanese artificial reefs and comparing the results with the ones obtained through an alternate method consisting of plotting persistence against maximum abundance and looking for a major gap along the persistence axis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this two-step method...|$|R

40|$|The host-plant {{selection}} {{sequence of}} phytophagous insects {{can be divided}} into three steps: (i) habitat location, (ii) host location, and (iii) host acceptance. Chemoreception plays a main role during the process. Olfaction is typically the most important sensory modality during the first two steps, whereas contact chemoreception dominates the third. At all steps in the selection sequence, positive and negative external stimuli interact with each other and also with internal factors in the insect, and the balance between positive and negative stimuli can be tipped towards either acceptance or rejection of a particular habitat or host. Non-host volatiles (NHV) have been shown to modulate host location behaviour in several insect orders. Few studies report effects at the <b>habitat</b> <b>level,</b> but in forest ecosystems, indications of anti-attractant effects at the <b>habitat</b> <b>level</b> has been found in a small number of conifer-inhabiting coleopterans and lepidopterans.

However, several other mechanisms have been suggested, all discussed here. Positive and negative olfactory stimuli are perceived by olfactory hairs (sensilla), mainly located on the antennae.

This study assesses habitat use by elephant (Loxodonta Africana), giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), nyala (Tragelaphus angasii) and impala (Aepyceros melampus) in Thanda Private Game Reserve, KwaZulu-Natal. Firstly, I {{examine the effects of}} body size dimorphism, sexual segregation and predation on habitat selection and resource partitioning by ungulates. The mechanisms driving resource partitioning strategies were studied at three environmental scales, namely broader habitat (using habitat preference ratios), local environment (using Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) and Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM)) and plant (feeding heights using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Regression analyses). At the <b>habitat</b> <b>level,</b> ungulates show distinct habitat preferences, independent of body size, which did not overlap, thus promote resource partitioning. Habitat selection, at the local environment level, varied among species but not between sexes. Therefore, body size class may influence selection for particular environmental characteristics. At the plant level, resource partitioning was evident among the larger species (giraffe and elephant) versus the smaller species (nyala and impala), but there was no apparent segregation among the sexes within species. Therefore, resource partitioning was strongest at the <b>habitat</b> <b>level,</b> bit less noticeable at the intermediate and finer plant scale. Secondly, I assessed the antipredator behaviour of multi-species assemblage in an experimental context (before vs. after lion reintroduction). I examined herbivore responses in terms of aggregation (forming safer groups), predator avoidance (selecting areas that predators avoid), and habitat selection in terms of habitat structure (selecting areas where capture is less likely), in response to lion reintroduction. Ungulates shifted habitats to avoid lion presence, i. e. into habitats least preferred by lion, and dominant species (based on body size) forced subordinate species into suboptimal habitats. However, counter predictions, ungulates did not increase their group size after lion were released. With the development of small private game reserves, intensive management is essential to maintain ecological heterogeneity, in this case through trophic cascades which promote coexistence. Managing ungulates as ecologically different according to body size will accommodate differences among herbivore populations. Long-term studies of habitat use by ungulates and predators will provide management with information to manipulate factors affecting habitat selection and predation, and thus sustainability of ungulate populations...|$|E
40|$|Human-caused {{disturbances}} {{can lead}} to the extinction of indigenous (endemic and native) species, while facilitating and increasing the colonisation of exotic species; this increase can, in turn, promote the similarity of species compositions between sites if human-dis-turbed sites are consistently invaded by a regionally species-poor pool of exotic species. In this study, we analysed the extent to which epigean arthropod assemblages of four islands of the Azorean archipelago are characterised by nestedness according to a habitat-altered gradient. The degree of nestedness represents the extent to which less ubiquitous species occur in subsets of sites occupied by the more widespread species, resulting in an ordered loss/gain of species across environmental or ecological gradients. A predictable loss of spe-cies across communities while maintaining others may lead to more similar communities (i. e. lower beta-diversity). In contrast, anti-nestedness occurs when different species tend to occupy distinct sites, thus characterising a replacement of species across such gradients. Our results showed that an increase in exotic species does not promote assemblage ho-mogenisation at the <b>habitat</b> <b>level.</b> On the contrary, exotic species were revealed as habita...|$|E
