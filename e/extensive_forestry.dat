Despite its <b>extensive</b> application in <b>forestry,</b> the Matrix model is still suffering from a lack of due attention and appropriate understanding, especially on its advantages and limitations in comparison with those of other forest dynamics models. To facilitate further research and applications, a synthetic review of Matrix models is provided here with an emphasis on its mathematical properties and relationship with other forest dynamics models. In this article, we first introduce the general structure of Matrix models and its representation of forest dynamics components, i. e., upgrowth, mortality, and recruitment. Then, we summarize key properties of Matrix models, including basic assumptions, density dependence, size class width and time step, and the estimation of forest dynamics components will be summarized. Next, we evaluate advantages and limitations of the Matrix model and its relationship with other forest dynamics models. Finally, we share our perspective on the major challenges and future outlooks of Matrix models. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

His wife Mary, who like her husband was still distraught over the death of the couples five-year-old son a year or so earlier, had insisted that any such property had to have a spring-fed babbling brook, evergreen forest and be near the railroad. The Chappaqua property met two of those conditions, with a small bog standing in for the spring and brook. In order to maximize the benefit of living in the countryside and escaping the hot city, Greeley built what his family came to refer to as the [...] "House in the Woods" [...] in what is still a wooded area southeast of the Church of Saint Mary the Virgin that his daughter Gabrielle had built early in the 20th century. Greeleys wife, however, found it shady and remote; at one point, the couple invited young Spiritualist Kate Fox to live with them for four months while they attempted to contact the spirit of their dead son through seances.

40|$|Forested {{wetlands}} {{throughout the}} world are valuable habitats; especially in relatively species-poor northern regions, they can be considered biological hotspots. Unfortunately, these areas have been degraded and destroyed. In recent years, however, the biological importance of wetlands has been increasingly recognized, resulting in the desire to restore disturbed habitats or create in place of destroyed ones. Restoration work is taking place across the globe in a diversity of wetland types, and research must be conducted to determine successful techniques. As a result, two studies {{of the effects of}} wetland restoration and creation were conducted in forested wetlands in northern Michigan and southern Finland. In North America, northern white-cedar wetlands have been declining in area, despite attempts to regenerate them. Improved methods for successfully establishing northern white-cedar are needed; as a result, the target of the first study was to determine if creating microtopography could be beneficial for white-cedar recruitment and growth. In northern Europe, spruce swamp forests have become a threatened ecosystem due to <b>extensive</b> drainage for <b>forestry.</b> As part of the restoration of these habitats, i. e. rewetting through ditch blocking, Sphagnum mosses are considered to be a critical element to re-establish, and an in-depth analysis of how Sphagnum is responding to restoration in spruce swamp forests has not been previously done.

40|$|The {{background}} {{of this study}} is an article in the hunting magazine “Svensk Jakt” where Karl Hedin claims that his sawmills has not noticed any significant moose damages in the timber. The purpose with the study is to find out the causes to the moose explosion and what it has led to in today’s forests. A questionnaire has been sent out to sawmills in the region Dalarna with the purpose of finding out if sawmills receive moose-damaged timber and what they think about how they foresee future development. There were two causes of the moose explosion, that had effects on the moose population. The first cause was that the moose hunters wanted to raise the moose population, and by raising the calf shooting and by saving the cows they succeeded. The second cause was changing methods in Swedish <b>forestry.</b> <b>Extensive</b> clear-cuttings led to much more food for the moose and the population grew. The moose ravages in the forests have a large negative effect on the forest. The growth in the stands decline and the number of stems per hectar drop significantly. The moose grazing on pines leads to different types of damages, trunk break, treetop grazing and bark eating. These damages on the pine leads to technical damages which leads to that the price on the log drops. The questionnaire shows that four of five sawmills has not noticed the moose explosion. The fifth sawmill writes that they don’t know. Three out of seven sawmills doesn’t see the moose as a threat. On the question of what they think about the future seven people answered. Four people believed that we can handle the problem in a good way and that business will continue {{in the same way as}} it has been.

The district covers 2780 km 2 southeast of Abu Dhabi island, and includes {{many of the}} suburbs of Abu Dhabi city, including the proposed Capital District, Madinat Khalifa A and B, Mussafah, Mohammed bin Zayed City, Mafraq, Bani Yas, Al Wathba, Al Falah, Al Shamka and Abu Dhabi International Airport. The sheet extends east as far as Al Khatim. The pre-Quaternary bedrock comprises Miocene evaporitic mudstone and siltstone of the Gachsaran Formation (Fars Group) overlain by the dolomitic conglomerates, sandstones and siltstones of the Barzaman Formation in the north. In the south and west, the Gachsaran Formation is overlain by the dolomites and limestones of the Dam Formation which forms an escarpment around the Al Dhafra Air Base. These are overlain by the sandstones of the Shuwaihat and Baynunah Formations. Borehole evidence suggests there is a gradation from interbedded siltstones and sandstones of the Baynunah Formation in {{the west of the}} district to coarse dolomitic conglomerates of the Barzaman Formation in the north. The Miocene rocks are locally overlain by fluvial sandstones and channel gravels of the Hili Formation which represent Quaternary outwash from the Hajar Mountains to the east. Much of the region is partially covered by pale carbonate aeolianites of the Ghayathi Formation, themselves often covered in a veneer of more recent aeolian sand. These are well exposed near the coast in spectacular zeugen and inland, they form a series of east-northeast trending linear ridges. Modern pale carbonate-dominated low dunes occur particularly in the west of the district. The coastal zone is dominated by a range of Late Pleistocene to Holocene littoral and marine deposits, which comprise the Abu Dhabi Formation. These include coastal spits and bars, algal mats, mangrove swamps and intertidal sediments. Sabkha is developed on the surface of these deposits. The region has seen major development over the past 30 years, which has radically changed the surface geology. Much of the coastal strip has been reclaimed or developed, with a variable amount of made ground, often composed of carbonate sand dredged from the neighbouring lagoons. Further inland, many areas have been extensively landscaped, with large areas of dunes levelled flat or quarried for fill. Much of the north-western part of the sheet is either developed or scheduled for development. <b>Extensive</b> areas of <b>forestry</b> occur along the line of the main Abu Dhabi – Al Ain highway and north of Abu Dhabi International Airport...|$|R

By increasing the economic base of Kosovo, namely the increase of industrialization also increases the number of larger settlements and reduce the number of smallest, such as in the censuses of 1961 dominated the settlements size < 500  inh with a number of 824 settlements. A decade later the number of settlements reduced to 688, while the number of settlements from 500 to 2500  inh increased by 588 – 710 representing the largest group of settlements in Kosovo. Growing marks, the settlements of range size 2500 – 5000  inh increased by 12 – 21, group of settlements 5000 – 25, 000  inh grow for two settlements, while it appeared {{for the first time the}} type of range size settlements > 50, 000  inh (Prishtina).

Military survey maps (1783, 1860, 1883 and 1890) and aerial photos (1950, 1965, 1980 and 2000) were used to evaluate land-use changes and to calculate the vegetational roughness of the area. To determinate the rate of overbank sedimentation sediment samples were collected from a pit, the grain-size, content of organic matter, heavy metal content (Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni and Cd) and pH were measured. Until 1950 meadows and pastures were typical on the floodplain, gallery-forest was along the river, the oxbow-lake and the artificial levee.

These land-use changes affected the average vegetational roughness, as it has been doubled since the disappearance of grasslands. Land-use changes highly affect the aggradation, as the increased roughness decreases the flood velocity on the floodplain, causing accelerated aggradation. Using Pb marker horizons and grain-size changes the studied sediment profile was compared to dated profiles (Braun et al. 2003), thus, the sediment accumulation rate could be determined for the periods of 1858 - 1965 and 1965 - 2005. According to our measurements the accumulation rate was doubled since 1965, very likely in connection with the doubled vegetational roughness...|$|E

It is possible to increase annual removals in a sustainable manner by applying more intensive forest management that also improves profitability nearly 50 %. The annualremovals can be ca. 40 % higher than the current level, and the annual energy wood removal can be over 10 mill m 3.

(SESAM), {{funded by the}} Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DGF) Sediment transport in the Ribera Salada stream was estimated from continuous suspended and bedload monitoring between 2005 and 2008. The Ribera Salada basin is a mountainous perennial river in the Southern Pyrenees and {{is representative of the}} <b>extensive</b> <b>forestry</b> land use in this upland region. Water and sediment fluxes have been analysed with the aim of determining the thresholds, duration, ranges and relative contributions of the two sediment transport modes (suspended and bedload), and their variability in relation to the basin's annual hydrology. The stream's hydrology in the first two sampling years was average {{in the context of a}} 10 -yr series of the basin, while 2007 ? 2008 can be classified as a wet year. The specific total sediment load during the study period amounted to 12 t km? 2 y? 1, a low value compared with similar Mediterranean counterparts. The maximum load (31. 5 t km? 2 y? 1) was observed during the wettest year of the monitoring programme. During average years most of the total load (> 90 %) was transported in suspension; consequently, suspended sediment transport is more frequent through time. In contrast, bedload occurs sporadically during floods that exceed certain hydraulic thresholds, corresponding to a flow equalled or exceeded 4 % of the time, that yields an average shear stress of not, vert, similar 35 N m? 2. Under such conditions bedload transport becomes relevant and, if the threshold is frequently exceeded as in relatively wet years such as 2007 ? 2008, may constitute the majority of the total sediment load (74 %). This paper provides new evidence of the distinct role of sediment transport modes in stable fluvial environments where only sporadic inputs of surplus energy (flow discharge) determine the dominant mode, magnitude and duration of their respective contribution.

Because of their residency, parids are vulnerable to habitat fragmentation and loss of habitat. I reviewed habitat selection in parids in North-America and Europe and compared with a field study of populations of tits {{in an area of}} southeastern Norway with <b>extensive</b> <b>forestry</b> to discuss possible impact of forestry on parids. North-American and European parids show similar patterns due to habitat selection. Almost all species forms stable flocks and are, to some extent, territorial during winter. The European species often form mixed-species flocks with other tits, goldcrest (Regulus regulus) and common treecreeper (Certhia familiaris). All species that form flocks also hoard food and are dependent on good hoarding sites. The great tit (Parus major) and the blue tit (Cyanistes caerulus) differ from the other species. They do not form stable flocks, are not territorial and do not hoard during winter. Together with coal tit (Periparus ater), they are also partly migratory. Human land use, like modern forestry, is believed to have a great impact on the biodiversity. The consequences of modern forestry management have been habitat fragmentation, alteration, and loss of forest has taken place. In my field study I looked at possible differences in population size and structure of winter flocking titmice communities in order to see if forestry may have impact on the abundance of small passerines in winter. Point-transect with sound playback were used as method to collect data. The field work was done from 23 th January to 17 th March 2015, in Varaldskogen State Forest, Norway.

40|$|Proceedings of the 2007 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 27 - 29, 2007, Athens, Georgia. Basin {{forest cover}} is {{understood}} to influence stream baseflow {{in a variety of}} ways, most significantly via increased soil infiltration and increased evapotranspiration (ET). <b>Extensive</b> <b>forestry</b> experimentation has consistently demonstrated a negative relationship between forest cover and baseflow, attributed to ET losses associated with greater forest cover. However, it is unclear whether this relationship can be extrapolated to larger spatial and temporal scales. Spatially, larger basins may contain greater subsurface storage capacity, potentially overriding the effects of ET losses on baseflow and contributing to a positive relationship between forest cover and baseflow. Temporally, non-forest land uses may be associated with pronounced soil modification, reducing infiltration and baseflow discharge, again resulting in a positive relationship between forest cover and baseflow. This study addresses the relationship between forest cover and baseflow in mesoscale sub-basins of the upper Little Tennessee River basin in Rabun County, Georgia and Macon County, North Carolina. Ten pairs of basins ranging from three to 33 km 2 were created by aligning key physical traits (e. g. basin size, aspect, and total relief), while allowing forest cover to differ within the pairs. Three series of synoptic measurements were conducted in July and August, 2005. In most pairs, greater baseflow per unit area was associated with higher forest cover, and an overall positive relationship was demonstrated between forest cover and baseflow among all twenty sub-basins. However, difference of means test results indicate a lack of statistical significance between baseflow of more forested vs. less forested stream basins. This study was conducted as a preliminary assessment for a larger study evaluating surface controls on baseflow in the southern Blue Ridge, and further research will evaluate the mechanisms driving the positive relationship between baseflow and forest cover in this region.

40|$|The European {{populations of}} {{capercaillie}} (Tetrao urogallus) and black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix) have declined the last 50 to 100 years. The decline has {{happened at the}} same time as changes in forestry practices, predation pressure and climate, but the specific drivers of the decline are still not clear. The aim of this thesis was to test the main drivers for population dynamics of the forest grouse species; capercaillie and black grouse. In South-East Norway, over a period of 41 years in Sjøliseterberget (1975 - 2016) and 19 years in Hobøl (1987 - 2016), data were collected each autumn by a line transect method. By this method capercaillie and black grouse abundance and reproduction, in addition to habitat (forest age classes) were registered. My main goal was to reveal if the reproduction of forest grouse had changed over time and what the main causes could be. I therefore, specifically tested the habitat preferences of forest grouse, if these habitats had changed during time of study and if the preference of forest grouse had changed accordingly, to establish whether forestry could be affecting the reproduction. In addition, annual drivers of forest grouse reproduction like weather in the summer (“The Weather Hypothesis”) and difference in predation pressure (“The Alternative Prey Hypothesis”) were tested. I found declining reproduction of capercaillie in Sjøliseterberget and black grouse in Hobøl. While the capercaillie preferred the oldest succession stages of the forest, the black grouse preferred younger forest. The proportion of medium old and old forest did not change in neither area over time, and nor did the forest grouse preferences. The reproduction was thus declining despite a stable age structure of the forest. I further found that temperature in June and differences in fox population from one year to another explained most of the variation in reproduction in Sjøliseterberget based on AICc model selection, while no factors explained the variation in reproduction in Hobøl. Lack of significant results in Hobøl was possibly caused by a smaller sample size. The alternative prey hypothesis was confirmed as a large vole population increased the fox population the next year, and this fox population decreased reproduction of forest grouse. Despite this two-step link between voles and forest grouse, no significant covariation between vole abundance and forest grouse reproduction was detected, even in periods with a high fox population. The weather hypothesis was partially confirmed as increase in temperature in June had a large positive effect on reproduction, while increase in precipitation in the same month did not have a negative effect as first predicted. Further analyses showed that also seasonal NAO affected the reproduction. This study contributes to the understanding of short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in population dynamics of capercaillie and black grouse. In addition, knowing how forest-dwelling species respond to variation in forestry, predation pressure and weather can help us understand how these species will persist in a future with <b>extensive</b> <b>forestry</b> and a changing climate...|$|E
40|$|This Sheet Explanation {{provides}} {{a summary of}} the geology of the district covered by Geological 1 : 50 000 Series Map Sheet 164 (Llanidloes), published in 2010 as a Bedrock and Superficial Deposits edition. The district mostly lies within the county of Powys, but includes small parts of Ceredigion in the extreme west and south-west. Much of {{the western part of the}} district is occupied by the deeply dissected uplands of the Cambrian Mountains, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In this area the land rises to 740 m on the flanks of Plynlimon (Pumlumon Fawr), the highest summit in the range. It falls away towards the eastern part of the district into rolling countryside that includes the important catchment of the River Severn (Afon Hafren) and its tributaries, the largest of which are the rivers Carno, Trannon, Cerist, Clywedog and Dulas. A major reservoir (Llyn Clywedog) occupies the upper reaches of the Clywedog valley, its purpose being to regulate river discharge and groundwater levels within the catchment. The south-western part of the district is drained by the River Wye (Afon Gwy) and its tributaries, that flow south-eastwards via Llangurig. The sources of both the Severn and Wye are situated on the eastern flanks of Plynlimon within the western part of the district. The town of Llanidloes is the main centre of population, with smaller settlements at Llangurig, Carno, Trefeglwys, Caersws and Staylittle; the Newtown conurbation impinges on the eastern part of the district. Much of the district is given over to beef and dairy farming, although sheep are reared in the remote upland areas in the west and <b>extensive</b> <b>forestry</b> plantations have been developed in places. The Ordovician and Silurian rocks of the district have been exploited locally, in the past, as a source of building material and, recently, commercial quantities of sandstone aggregate have been excavated at Penstrowed Quarry [SO 0680 9100]. The district includes part of the Central Wales Mining Field from which substantial volumes of lead and zinc ore were extracted during the 19 th and early 20 th centuries. A number of former mine sites are still visible, notably along the Van, Nant-y-ricket, Dylife, Dyfngwm and Llanerchyraur lodes (Jones, 1922 [1]; IGS, 1974), and the historic Bryntail Mine, below the Clywedog Dam has been restored as a site of industrial archaeological interest. The district is underlain by a succession of Late Ordovician (Ashgill) to Silurian sedimentary rocks, over 5 km thick, deposited between 450 and 420 million years ago in the Early Palaeozoic Welsh Basin (Figure P 930911). The basin developed on a fragment of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, known as Eastern Avalonia (e. g. Pickering et al., 1988 [2]), that drifted northwards to collide with the continents of Baltica and Laurentia during the Late Ordovician and Silurian (Soper and Hutton, 1984 [3]; Soper and Woodcock, 1990 [4]; Woodcock and Strachan, 2000 [5]). To the east and the south of the basin lay the Midland Platform, a relatively stable shallow marine shelf that was subject to periodic emergence. The basinal sediments are predominantly deep marine turbiditic facies that were introduced into the district by density currents from southerly, south-easterly and north-westerly quadrants. Coeval shallower-water ‘shelfal’ sediments were deposited north and east of the district, and locally impinge on its northern margins. Thickness variations within the major sedimentary units suggest that, at times, syndepositional fault movements were an important control on their distribution. During late Silurian (Ludlow) times, shallowing of the basin occurred, and sandstones, variably interpreted as a turbiditic (Cave and Hains, 2001 [6]) or storm-generated facies (Tyler and Woodcock, 1987 [7]), were laid down over the eastern part of the district and adjacent areas. The shallowing was a result of tectonic reconfiguration of the basin, a precursor to the late Caledonian (Acadian) Orogeny that affected the region during the late Early Devonian, around 400 million years ag...|$|E
40|$|The botanical {{control of}} nature {{reserves}} based on structure ecology In contrast with previous ideas the human control of nature reserves is nowadays seen as indispensable {{for the preservation}} of variety-in space and stability-in-time. Botanical control of nature reserves has for its object the conservation of their various plant communities against alterations coming from the inside and the outside. A second purpose is the enlarging of their internal spatial variety, for the more variety-in-space is present the more varietyin-time can be counteracted. In both cases the cybernetical term “regulation amplifying” is an adequate expression for our activities. The theoretically most difficult problem in modern control is due to its preponderant external character which type is inevitably leading to convergence and some loss of spatial structure. This loss will be the greater the more our methods and tools are going into the convergent direction. Some knowledge about this difficulty may however protect us from unjustified reproaches to the controller involved. Our ancestors did not meet these problems, firstly because they were missing the technical resources for increasing the environmental convergence to an excessive height and secondly because, as agrarians, they formed part of a whole, some relics of which we are trying to preserve now. The old-fashioned agricultural and mining systems automatically led to regulation amplifying in the landscape around their dwelling places by three factors: 1. Stability of the methods. 2. Isolation by distance (development of anthropogeneous ecoclines). 3. Action on a small scale. Provisionally estimated only 5 — 10 % has remained now of the former biological richness of the Netherlands (less than a century ago) which was mainly based on those three fundaments. All human operations in nature are bringing about change and disturbance. In fig. 1, expressing the second factor (ecocline of human influence) nearly all possible types of normal anthropogeneous disturbance are drawn as concentric circles around a village; the intensity of the influence is gradually decreasing from the inside to the outside: manuring, farming, hay-making, burning, pasturing, cutting of sods, digging out, coppice exploitation, <b>extensive</b> <b>forestry,</b> raking of sphagnum, removal of moss and litter and non-intervention. The two arrows directed to the centre not only indicate the effect of treading on ways but they are also marking the concentration of nutrients from the outside to the inside. In fig. 2 nearly the same types of disturbance are shown “en profil”, together with the principal effects on vegetation and soil and most of the synsystematical units belonging to the various categories of human influence. It is stressed that the removal of soil and organic materials are representing the two most important {{and at the same time}} most expensive measures for the botanical control of nature reserves in man-made landscapes. Two main types of control are discerned here, viz. an internal control (continuation of oldfashioned agricultural and mining methods within the reserve) and an external one (protection against the effects of modern agricultural and mining methods coming from the outside). With regard to both types three basic rules are given, for the greater part leaning on the three factors mentioned before: Basic rule I. The preservation of the botanical richness of a nature reserve is most assured if its treatment forms as good as possible a copy of and is directly connected with the methods applied formerly, and is later on subject to as little change as possible. Basic rule II. In case the character and size of a nature reserve are suitable, its internal regulation can be amplified by furthering the development of ecoclines based on the degree of human influence within the area. Basic rule III. Our controlling operations have to be done gradually and on a small scale. Basic rule IV. The external protection of nature reserves in landscapes with a coarse-grained pattern has to be based on their form and size. The more concentric the form and the larger the surface the more safe the areas will be against alterations threatening them from the outside. Basic rule V. If the extension of a nature reserve is sufficient the controller has to take advantage of the ecoclines which are developing along the outskirts by interaction of internal and external influences. In this connection it is a condition that oligotrophic circumstances are predominating over eutrophic ones. Basic rule VI. If alterations are induced from the outside the internal botanical control has to be directed on the delaying of the processes evoked by them...|$|E
