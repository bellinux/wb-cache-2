500|$|At {{the end of}} the season, {{there was}} a {{consensus}} that [...] "The giant center of Michigan practically stands in a class by himself at the pivot position". [...] University of Chicago star Walter Eckersall, said: [...] "Schulz, of Michigan, easily outshone his opponents in every game. [...] He is finely built, runs fast, snaps accurately, tackles hard, and <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> field in every play". [...] One writer referred to Schulz in 1907 as a [...] "human catapult" [...] and said: [...] "Schulz of Michigan is a very heavy man, weighing over 200pounds, yet he is strikingly fast on his feet and is unusual on that account. [...] He propels his massive frame at a rate of speed that terrifies opponents.... The acknowledged prowess of Schulz makes him an especial object of unfair attack in scrimmages by opponents who hope, by disabling him, to weaken the Michigan team".|$|E
500|$|... "Love Somebody" [...] is a dance-pop {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and forty-nine seconds. It is written in the key of D♭ major and its {{instrumentation}} consists of piano and guitar. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone described the song's synth hook as the Sly Stone-meets-Eurythmics. According to Chris Payne of Billboard, Tedder and Zancanella's influence <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> song and inches through the verses [...] "before bubbling over just before the chorus kicks in." [...] Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly {{in a review of}} the album, wrote that the song together with [...] "Daylight" [...] have [...] "thickly" [...] produced choruses. Lyrically, [...] "Love Somebody" [...] equates love and physical intimacy, with Levine singing: [...] "I really wanna love somebody [...] I really wanna touch somebody". Nate Chinen of The New York Times described the lyrical theme of the song as [...] "a plea for salvation on the dance floor or some other horizontal surface".|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} reviewers found the album overly long, while others felt Feldmann {{was too much}} of an influence. Mike Damante at the Houston Chronicle said [...] "Feldmann's style <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> record, as most tracks sound too formulaic, similar and run together. Other tracks are way too commercial, even for a band the size of blink.... California is {{ultimately}} a step back, rather a throwback." [...] David Anthony from The A.V. Club gave the album a C-, commenting, [...] "California is the sound of Blink-182 desperately trying to remain relevant by outsourcing its creativity. [...] is another homogenous addition to Feldmann's growing résumé. But this time he unintentionally removed the soul of pop-punk's clown princes in the process." [...] Nina Corcoran from Consequence of Sound was similarly negative: [...] "When not cranking the compression on the vocals, Feldmann ruins other songs with nonstop gimmicks: the piano interludes, the stiffened handclaps, the sappy title track." [...] Gwilym Mumford of The Guardian, focusing on the album's turbulent history regarding the departure of DeLonge, deemed the album [...] "a tired – and tiring – work." ...|$|E

500|$|Mars {{revealed}} to Billboard in September 2012 on {{a preview of}} his cover story that he recorded an album that represented his freedom. On his debut record, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, the singer reportedly had to change some things because of pressure from his label, something he was displeased with. He clarified that Unorthodox Jukebox was more of him and what he stands for, mainly because he didn't have to modify things. He elaborated, [...] "If I'm changing things around because people might think it's a hard pill to swallow then I'm going {{to feel like a}} circus clown onstage, selling something fake". The variety of music styles presented on Unorthodox Jukebox resulted in his rejection from his label several times in the past; he also confessed that he had to face criticism by label presidents, who—according to him—expressed, [...] "Your music sucks, you don't know who you are, your music <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> place, and we don't know how to market this stuff. Pick a lane and come back to us". To these statements, the singer added that he felt [...] "disgusted" [...] as he wanted to have the liberty to create his own music and not the music he was told to do.|$|E
500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 55, based on 14 reviews, which indicates [...] "mixed or average reviews". Billboard was positive toward the album, writing that {{the album is}} [...] "a must-heard recording rich with pleasantly surprising depth". In a mixed review, E! Online wrote, [...] "If she had just shown up and sang her ass off, Stripped would've been a better show". Josh Kun from Spin commented, [...] "As an artistic statement, Stripped <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> placeit's a move toward hip-hop, it's a move toward rock, it's ghetto, it's Disney". Jancee Dunn of Rolling Stone provided a three-out-of-five-stars rating for the album, calling it [...] "almost" [...] an album for grown-ups, yet criticized its lack of musical concentration. Blender wrote a mixed review, yet commenting {{that it is better}} than Britney Spears' works. Writing for BBC Music, Jacqueline Hodges said that the album [...] "is as full-on bold and over the top as most of Christina's outfits... much of this seems to be an exercise in stretching the vocal chords to weak backing tracks". Jim Wirth for NME commented that Stripped is a Mariah Carey album. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that the album is [...] "so overproduced and overwrought that it could easily pass for a Janet album".|$|E
500|$|Grey's Anatomy {{has been}} well {{received}} among critics. The show holds an average of 71% positive score on Rotten Tomatoes and 7.7/10 score at IMDB site. The A.V. Club gave an insight on both the overwhelming success and lows {{in the quality of}} the hit medical drama saying, [...] "The quality arc for the show <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> place, starting with a steady build in the first season, then skyrocketing into phenomenon in season two, then leveling off and dipping in season three, before having some seriously bumpy moments in seasons four (interrupted by the writers’ strike) and five. The climb begins again in season six" [...] Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly in a review wrote, [...] " [...] I believe the show’s best season to date is season 2. Let me make it clear that I’m not saying seasons 3 through 9 were bad. In my opinion, there have only been a few lulls in the show’s history, and most of them didn’t last a full season." [...] adding, [...] "I still enjoy the show, and I’ll honestly never stop watching. By any standards, Grey’s Anatomy has been successful television, ranking highly in the ratings for nine seasons and entering the cultural lexicon via phrases as cloying yet catchy as [...] "McDreamy.", the show has had its periods of being intensely irritating, and it has had its periods when it seems as if Shonda Rhimes has taken leave of her faculties, but it’s also got an amazingly high batting average, particularly with every solid season that passes along in this second act of its run." [...] The site lauded the show saying, [...] "On average, it’s been very good TV, filled with interesting, driven characters who run the gamut of professions within the show’s hospital setting. It’s been, by turns, a good soap, a good romantic comedy, a good medical drama, and a good interpersonal show about an unexpected workplace family." ...|$|E

2500|$|Discussing the {{influence}} aesthetic for Shadows of the Sun and {{the influence}} of chamber music, Rygg commented, “There's no specific aesthetic other than a sense of the beautiful itself, I suppose. There's a connection to classical composition, that's pretty obvious. Some Wagner transpositions. Some Schumann warped beyond recognition etc. in there. [...] "Funebre" [...] is largely based on one single bar off Wagner and we have that little Chopin signature thrown in there as well. So yeah, even though we use fewer notes, the classical stamp <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> record. Beach Boys? It's probably the vocal thing, that I am fond of clean-sung, layered, well-produced vocals and harmonies. That's another rarity these days. I wonder, where did all the sunshine pop go?” ...|$|E
2500|$|Another columnist, writing {{under the}} name [...] "Roundy," [...] wrote that Kirk gave him [...] "an eye full," [...] turning plays [...] "so fast that the thing is looked up in the stands as a joke." [...] Roundy {{continued}} in his praise of Kirk as follows:"As soon as Kirk grabs a pass he becomes a halfback with his speed and trick running. [...] His run on the kickoff through the whole Illinois team proved that, for an end, he <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> field and has a nose for fumbles, is strong and tricky. [...] There {{is no such thing}} as boxing this bird. Kirk, and his tackling of receivers of punts is a beautiful thing to see. [...] So the ends are the strongest spot on the team. [...] These two birds can play on my team any time, any place, anywhere, and at any price." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reflector was {{released}} in March 2000 and had a début at No.1; it spent sevenweeks {{at the top of}} the ARIA charts. McFarlane opined that it was [...] "one of the most highly anticipated Australian releases in recent years, it was a remarkably assured début, a mix of spirited pop, big rock riffs and adolescent energy." [...] Jon Azpri of AllMusic rated it as two out of five stars, he felt their first two singles were [...] "catchy pop hits with just enough of a grrl-rock edge to mollify young audiences. The rest of the album <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> map." [...] By the end of 2001, Reflector had shipped over 280,000 copies in Australia, being certified 4× platinum. It provided two further singles: [...] "Live Without It" [...] (April 2000) and [...] "Superman Supergirl" [...] (September). The album also charted on the New Zealand Albums Chart at No.19 with three of its tracks reaching the related singles chart's top50.|$|E

Shortly after finding out she is pregnant, Kat falls ill and is rushed to hospital and discovers that she has suffered a miscarriage. The Daily Star reports: [...] "The pregnancy takes Kat and Alfie completely by surprise and neither of them know how they really feel about it," [...] a source said. [...] "Kat is understandably very nervous and anxious about having another baby. Her head <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> place. But before she has a chance {{to get used to the}} idea she suffers a miscarriage. It is a cruel thing to happen to them after everything that they've already been through this year.

2500|$|Stonewall Jackson {{wanted to}} press his {{advantage}} before Hooker and his army could regain their bearings and plan a counterattack, which might still succeed {{because of the}} sheer disparity in numbers. He rode out onto the Plank Road that night to determine the feasibility of a night attack {{by the light of}} the full moon, traveling beyond the farthest advance of his men. When one of his staff officers warned him about the dangerous position, Jackson replied, [...] "The danger <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over.</b> <b>The</b> enemy is routed. Go back and tell A.P. Hill to press right on." [...] As he and his staff started to return, they were incorrectly identified as Union cavalry by men of the 18th North Carolina Infantry, who hit Jackson with friendly fire. Jackson's three bullet wounds were not in themselves life-threatening, but his left arm was broken and had to be amputated. While recovering, he contracted pneumonia and died on May 10. His death was a devastating loss for the Confederacy. Some historians and participants—particularly those of the postbellum Lost Cause movement—attribute the Confederate defeat at Gettysburg two months later to Jackson's absence.|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Martin Robinson {{rated the}} PlayStation 2 version 4.5 out of 10, the DS version 4 out of 10, and the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Wii and Xbox 360 {{versions}} 3.5 out of 10. He was heavily {{critical of the}} deception and evasion minigames, and although he thought the Alethiometer gameplay was interesting, he felt its almost wholly optional nature in the game undermined it. He was most critical, however, of the plot; [...] "The story is a mess standing on its own [...] The game makes little attempt to portray Pullman's world, instead opting to magpie scenes from the film and career through the story with little concession for the player." [...] Ryan Clements rated the PC version 3.5 out of 10 arguing [...] "the game <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> place and pretty much does nothing well." [...] As with Robinson, he was {{highly critical of the}} plot, which he argued was incomprehensible unless the player was familiar with the novel or the film. He concluded, [...] "Besides lousy gameplay, The Golden Compass has little else worth mentioning. The graphics, regardless of which system you play on, don't push the hardware at all. The sound is almost never properly synchronized with what's happening on the screen, and the overall presentation is embarrassingly cheap." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to Irvine, IGN UK's Martin Robinson said [...] "it's not Devil May Cry, Ninja Gaiden or God of War that's the best {{point of reference}} but Super Mario Galaxy": he felt Bayonetta, like the Nintendo game, [...] "loves to tinker with the player's sense of perspective, and fights that begin on street surface often wind {{their way up the}} surrounding walls." [...] Ryan Clements of IGN called the game [...] "stylish, entertaining", and [...] "unique", and its voice work [...] "a bit campy but still extremely enjoyable", but said its [...] "plot <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> place" [...] and [...] "isn't as skillfully told as game stories like Mass Effect and Uncharted. In his 360 version review, Clements called the game an [...] "incredible work" [...] with [...] "final moments... alone worth the price of admission", but said it sometimes exhibited minor [...] "screen tearing and slowdown, which happen during explorative sections and intense action sequences, respectively." [...] He said the PS3 version was [...] "still a fun game" [...] but had [...] "a lot of problems, primary among them being the excessive slowdown and loading". Eurogamer commented that [...] "the result is a game that exemplifies so much of what commentators claim has died in the Japanese game industry. A blast of creative brilliance, both technically accomplished, strategically deep and infused with rare imagination, Bayonetta represents the pinnacle of its chosen niche." ...|$|E
