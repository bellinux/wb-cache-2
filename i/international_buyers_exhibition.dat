30|$|Quality {{certifications}} {{also allow}} firms, especially those located {{in developing countries}} such as China, to signal to potential <b>international</b> <b>buyers</b> their product quality (Terlaak and King 2006). Identification of high quality sellers has been a central issue surrounding international trade because desirable attributes are often complex and difficult to measure (Munim and Schramm 2018; Terlaak and King 2006). Linguistic and cultural differences further hinder credible international communication and negatively affect the confidence of <b>international</b> <b>buyers,</b> leading to high transaction costs for buyers trying to precisely identify high quality exporters (Hallak 2006; Hummels and Klenow 2005). This is particularly the case for sellers from developing countries who often find themselves at a disadvantage position because buyers often perceive lower quality standards from an generally negative product image in these countries (Hudson and Jones 2003; Tybout 2000). Quality certifications can effectively provide credible signals about product quality from firms in developing countries, enabling <b>international</b> <b>buyers</b> to differentiate between high- and low-quality products from the same country (Potoski and Prakash 2009).|$|R
