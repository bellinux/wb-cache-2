5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E
25|$|I {{told people}} the {{complete}} opposite. I told them I raised it up 140 volts. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> bad. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> f—ing horrible, man. They said, “Please don’t attempt what Eddie Van Halen {{said in the}} last interview, because everyone was blowing their amps.” Everyone fried their amps ’cause of me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> bad. I never lied again after that.|$|E
500|$|Barbara Holper was the {{daughter}} of Hieronymus Holper, under whom Albrecht the Elder served his apprenticeship as a goldsmith. The two men became friends, and when she came of age Holper gave his daughter into marriage when Dürer senior was 40 and she was 15. The couple were compatible, well-matched and fond of each other. Yet their son's writings detail their difficult lives and many setbacks; three of their 18 children survived into adulthood – 17 of whom had been born by the time of this portrait. After her husband died Barbara was destitute and went to live with her son. After she in turn died in 1514, her son wrote [...] "This my pious Mother... often had the plague and many other severe and strange illnesses, and she suffered great poverty, scorn, contempt, mocking words, terrors, and great adversities. Yet she bore no malice. Also she died hard... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> grieved for her that I cannot express it." ...|$|E

6000|$|Jack waited. The fiery grip of {{the brandy}} relaxed; the genial warmth of it was wafted through him persuasively from head to foot. He took another sip. His eyes began to glitter. [...] "What divine being made this?" [...] he asked. Without waiting to be answered, he tried it again, and emptied the cup. [...] "More!" [...] he cried. [...] "I never <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> big, <b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> strong, <b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> clever, as <b>I</b> feel now!" ...|$|R

500|$|Higgins {{started writing}} tracks for her second album {{as soon as}} she had {{finished}} recording The Sound of White, which was released in 2004. She said, [...] "I started quite early because I knew there would a lot of pressure for the second album and I didn't want to write songs under anyone's stopwatch." [...] "100 Round the Bends" [...] was written while she was still recording the first album. During 2006, Higgins spent six months living in Broome, Western Australia, away from the distractions of the entertainment industry. Here she was able to relax and focus on creating new material for her next album. The landscape around Broome inspired the lyrics for [...] "Going North". She said, [...] "It was the first place I'd ever felt honestly connected with my country, with the physical land of my country". The lyrics for [...] "Steer" [...] were inspired when Higgins looked up at the night sky on a Broome beach: [...] "It dawned on me how small we are, how short life is ... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> liberated to have finally figured that out." ...|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{was awarded}} a {{bachelor}} of arts degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1976, and received a master of fine arts degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978. [...] It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences {{between her and her}} classmates: [...] "It wasn't as if I didn't know who I was. I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it {{had anything to do with}} why <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That's when I decided I would write about something my classmates couldn't write about." [...] She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her [...] "neighbors, the people [...] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through." ...|$|E
500|$|The song, {{which was}} the last one written for the album, was placed {{at the end of the}} album because it [...] "marks a new beginning" [...] for the band, {{which was the}} theme on the album and a theme in Lee's life. In the booklet of The Open Door, she stated that her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler, was the main {{inspiration}} for the song. In the booklet she wrote, [...] "Josh, you are my muse. Nothing inspires me the way you do. Thank you for all my missing pieces. Thank you for your strength and love. Thank you for letting me see myself through your eyes, because only then could I know that I am good enough for you." [...] One of the band's previous singles, [...] "Bring Me to Life", was also written about Josh Hartzler. In an interview with VH1, Lee further revealed the inspiration behind the song, saying [...] "I had gone through a lot of difficult things during the writing of the whole album, and by the end of it, I had stepped away from those bad situations. That's really hard. You have to be really brave and strong about it. After doing that, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> amazing. For the first time I felt like I could write a song based on how good I felt. I have never done that before ever. During another interview with The Washington Post she stated: ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{month after}} the Gomez fight, it was {{announced}} that Jorge Rubio would become Khan's new trainer. Rubio was chosen because Khan thought that he had very good chemistry with the Cuban trainer. Khan said, [...] "Rubio was showing me all these new training techniques, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> comfortable because it suited my style. I knew I had the hand speed and the footwork to do it and I {{knew it was going to}} make me a much better fighter".|$|E
2500|$|A {{pivotal moment}} {{in her life}} came during the summer before her sophomore year, when she went with a friend to the Gonzaga University girls' {{basketball}} camp. She would say about the trip in 2011, [...] "I just {{fell in love with}} this place. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> comfortable here." [...] The Gonzaga women's basketball staff was equally enthusiastic about her, except for head coach Kelly Graves, who had little opportunity to see her during the camp. Graves would finally get to see Vandersloot at length in her junior year, on the day before the 2006 Washington Class 4A state tournament. He offered her a scholarship after seeing her practice, even though he did not stay for the tournament.|$|E

2500|$|The {{album is}} DeBarge's first studio release in 16 years, {{following}} {{a period of}} drug addiction and legal problems. After his release from prison in 2009, he was introduced by his manager, Pete Farmer, to music executives Ron Fair and Jimmy Iovine at Geffen and Interscope Records. DeBarge sang a cappella in his audition for the label. He later said of the meeting and audition, [...] "we put a plan together and the minute I stepped into the studio I was so nervous, but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> much power just coming through me soon as I hit the microphone it was like, it was still there". He subsequently signed a recording deal with the label and began working on Second Chance.|$|E
2500|$|She {{wrote it}} with American {{songwriter}} and producer Dan Wilson. It {{was one of}} the last written for 21. The track, which epitomizes the lyrical content of 21, summarizes the now defunct relationship that the record is all about. Adele has openly discussed the genesis of it saying, [...] "Well, I wrote that song because I was exhausted from being such a bitch, with 'Rolling in the Deep' or 'Rumour Has It' ... I was really emotionally drained from the way I was portraying him, because even though I'm very bitter and regret some parts of it, he's still the most important person that's ever been in my life, and 'Someone like You,' I had to write it to feel OK with myself and OK with the two years I spent with him. And when I did it, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> freed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Russian fans {{gathered}} outside the U.S. embassy in Moscow to mourn. One told Russia's Novosti newspaper, [...] "This is so difficult! I'm hurt, very hurt! … For us, {{this is a}} very great loss. To us, he became a symbol of the spiritual world. It's hard to convey how great a loss this is." [...] France's Minister Culture, Frédéric Mitterrand, said, [...] "We all have a Michael Jackson within." [...] Elizabeth Taylor, a long-time friend, said she can't imagine life without him. Liza Minnelli told CBS, [...] "When the autopsy comes, all hell's going to break loose, so thank God we're celebrating him now." [...] His sister La Toya claimed that his daughter said he was being overworked. La Toya is quoted as saying: [...] "She said, 'No, you don't understand. They kept working him and Daddy didn't want that, but they worked him constantly'. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1945, Bess Myerson {{became the}} first Jewish-American and the first Miss New York (competing as Miss New York City, a {{competition}} organized by a local radio station) to win the Miss America pageant as Miss America 1945. As the only Jewish contestant, Myerson was encouraged by the pageant directors to change her name to [...] "Bess Meredith" [...] or [...] "Beth Merrick", but she refused. After winning the title (and as a Jewish Miss America), Myerson received few endorsements and later recalled that [...] "I couldn't even stay in certain hotels [...] there would be signs that read no coloreds, no Jews, no dogs. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> rejected. Here I was chosen to represent American womanhood and then America treated me like this." [...] She thus cut short her Miss America tour and instead traveled with the Anti-Defamation League. In this capacity, she spoke against discrimination in a talk entitled, [...] "You Can't Be Beautiful and Hate." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 1998, {{at the age}} of 14, Duffy {{was briefly}} put in a police safe house when {{authorities}} uncovered a plot by her stepfather's ex-wife to pay an assassin £3,000 to kill her stepfather, Philip Smith. Smith's ex-wife, Dawn Watson, was sentenced to a 3½-year jail term for soliciting to murder. Smith had previously beaten up Watson's new husband Marc Watson, who had also accused Smith of being violent towards his ex-partner whilst they were together. [...] "I was so terrified. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> ill," [...] Duffy recounted in 2008, as reported by the NME and the Sun. Duffy describes living in the safe house as a dog-eat-dog, claustrophobic and isolating experience. At age 15, she ran away back to her father's home in Nefyn. Duffy said in retrospect, [...] "It was a horrendous thing to do." [...] Her mother and her sisters did not speak to her for about a year afterward. In reaction to her parents' break-up, the following three years were a rebellious period that included binge drinking and stealing a rowing boat.|$|E
2500|$|Sharapova {{has made}} varying remarks {{on how long}} she intends to {{maintain}} her tennis career. Following the retirement of 25-year-old Justine Henin in 2008, Sharapova said, [...] "If I [...] 25, and I'd won so many Grand Slams, I'd quit too." [...] In an interview after the 2008 Australian Open, she balked {{at the idea of}} playing for another ten years, saying that she hoped to have a [...] "nice husband and a few kids" [...] by then. However, in an interview before her 2012 Australian Open semifinal, Sharapova changed her stance, saying she intended to continue playing tennis {{for as long as she}} enjoyed playing the game. Sharapova stated, [...] "I'm sure when I was 17 years old and someone said, you'll be playing for another eight years, it would be like, you're not going to see me at a press conference at 25 years old. But years go on. I missed a year in my career—I didn't play that year. I've said this, just before the tournament, a few weeks before, I woke up, and I was just so happy to be going back on the court. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> fresh, full of energy, just with a really good perspective. Times change, obviously. I see myself playing this sport for many more years because it's something that gives me the most pleasure in my life. I think it helps when you know you're good at something, and you can always improve it. It obviously helps with the encouragement." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nietzsche {{expressed}} {{admiration for}} 17th-century French moralists such as La Rochefoucauld, La Bruyère and Vauvenargues, {{as well as}} for Stendhal. The organicism of Paul Bourget influenced Nietzsche, as did that of Rudolf Virchow and Alfred Espinas. Nietzsche wrote in a letter in 1867 {{that he was trying to}} improve his German style of writing with the help of Lessing, Lichtenberg and Schopenhauer. It was probably Lichtenberg (along with Paul Rée) whose aphoristic style of writing contributed to Nietzsche's own use of aphorism instead of an essay. Nietzsche early learned of Darwinism through Friedrich Albert Lange. The essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson had a profound influence on Nietzsche, who [...] "loved Emerson from first to last", wrote [...] "Never have <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> much at home in a book", and called him [...] " [...] author who has been richest in ideas in this century so far." [...] Hippolyte Taine influenced Nietzsche's view on Rousseau and Napoleon. Notably, he also read some of the posthumous works of Charles Baudelaire, Tolstoy's My Religion, Ernest Renan's Life of Jesus and Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Demons. Nietzsche called Dostoevsky [...] "the only psychologist from whom I have anything to learn." [...] While Nietzsche never mentions Max Stirner, the similarities in their ideas have prompted a minority of interpreters to suggest a relationship between the two. In 1861 Nietzsche wrote an enthusiastic essay on his [...] "favorite poet", Friedrich Hölderlin, mostly forgotten at that time. He also expressed deep appreciation for Stifter's Indian Summer, Byron's Manfred and Twain's Tom Sawyer.|$|E
