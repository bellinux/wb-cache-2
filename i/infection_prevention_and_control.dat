40|$|ABSTRACT To {{summarize}} the historical events and drivers underlying public {{policy for the}} <b>prevention</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> of healthcare-associated <b>infections</b> in Brazil and in the United Kingdom.

Findings highlight how the development of healthcare-associated <b>infections</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> policies followed similar trajectories in Brazil and the United Kingdom. This can be conceptualized around four sequential phases: Formation, Consolidation, Standardization, and Monitoring and Evaluation. However, while we identified similar phases of development in Brazil and the United Kingdom, {{it can be seen that}} the former entered each stage around 20 years after the latter...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{disparity}} between the HIV prevalence in the seriously mentally ill (SMI) population (8 %) {{as compared to the}} general population (0. 6 %) in the United States. In order to identify interventions for HIV prevention for people with SMI, a literature search was conducted in PubMed and PsychInfo. For PubMed, the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were used: HIV <b>Infections,</b> <b>Prevention</b> <b>and</b> <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> Mental Disorders. For PsychInfo the following terms were used in the search: Mental Disorders and HIV. Sixteen independent studies were found after being subjected to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The most notable finding of this study was that effective gender-specific interventions have been designed and implemented in SMI populations. Also HIV prevention interventions have demonstrated changes in attitudes and HIV related risk behaviors in this population. However analysis by some of the studies revealed that the intervention outcomes can be impacted by individual differences (i. e. race, psychiatric diagnosis, and reported substance use). The issue of exploring subpopulations among people with SMI is the next suggested step in combatting this issue. This essay is of public health significance because it explores the issue of reducing HIV related risk behaviors in people with mental illness in order to reduce their chance of contracting this deadly virus...|$|R

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among PG students of Conservative and Endodontics in Bangalore using a pretested questionnaire. Results: A total of 88 % accepted endodontic files need to be sterilized and 60 % reported that endodontic instruments can be used four or more times, but 44 % practiced it. Interestingly, 74 % reported that dental assistants are not trained for sterilization protocols. Conclusion : The study shows that although there is high knowledge and positive attitude regarding sterilization of endodontic files, but it is seldom practiced creating lacunae in motivation. To bridge this gap, frequent reinforcement is needed in the critical area of sterilization...|$|R

Fungal outbreaks still occur in healthcare settings, especially among patients with hema-tological malignancies {{and those who are}} immunocompromised.

40|$|AbstractAntibiotic {{resistance}} among Gram-positive bacteria {{has increased}} relentlessly in recent years, thereby compromising {{the use of}} traditional therapies. In the hospital setting, multidrug-resistant pathogens, particularly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and emerging vancomycin-resistant pathogens, cause serious infections and create a substantial financial burden. Perhaps of greater concern are the increasingly frequent reports of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA). As the present distinction between CA-MRSA and hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) begins to blur, the predicted consequences of CA-MRSA include endemic infection within the community and a potential further increase in the burden of nosocomial infection. Reducing the spread of antimicrobial resistance will require worldwide cooperation. Regulatory authorities have already been established {{in a number of}} countries to implement <b>infection</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>and</b> <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> initiatives. Complementary to such measures in the management of infectious disease is the development of novel therapeutic agents. Newly approved agents, such as daptomycin, are welcome additions to the increasingly narrow range of effective therapies...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Routine {{screening}} {{is key to}} {{sexually transmitted}} <b>infection</b> (STI) <b>prevention</b> <b>and</b> <b>control.</b> Previous studies suggest that clinic-based screening programmes capture only {{a small proportion of}} people with STIs. Self-sampling using non- or minimally invasive techniques may be beneficial for those reluctant to actively engage with conventional sampling methods. We systematically reviewed studies of patients' experiences of obtaining self-samples to diagnose curable STIs. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, BNI, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to identify relevant articles published in English between January 1980 and March 2014. Studies were included if participants self-sampled for the diagnosis of a curable STI and had specifically sought participants' opinions of their experience, acceptability, preferences, or willingness to self-sample. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 558 references. Of these, 45 studies met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-six studies assessed patients' acceptability and experiences of self-sampling. Pooled results from these studies shows that self-sampling is a highly acceptable method with 85...|$|R
