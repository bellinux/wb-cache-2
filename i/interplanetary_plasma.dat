Thus, DR Plus ID (DRPID) is an observable independent of plasma refraction, while actual DRVID (DR minus ID) measures the time variation of the path electron content independently of spacecraft motion. The DRVID principle has been known since 1961.

40|$|An extreme {{ultraviolet}} (EUV) imaging spectrograph designed for sounding rocket flight {{has been used}} to search for velocity fields in the low solar corona. During a flight in May, 1989, we obtained emission line profile measurements along a chord through an active region on the Sun. Relative Doppler velocities were measured in emission lines of Mg IX, Fe XV, and Fe XVI with a sensitivity of 2 - 3 km/s at 350 A. The only Doppler shift appreciably greater than this level was observed in the line of Mg IX at 368. 1 A over the umbra of the large sunspot. The maximum shift measured at that location corresponded to a velocity toward the observer of 14 plus or minus 3 km/s relative to the mean of measurements in that emission line made elsewhere over the active region. The magnetic field in the low corona was aligned to within 10 deg of the line of sight at the location of maximum Doppler shift. Depending on the magnetic field geometry, this mass outflow could either re-appear as a downflow of material in distant footprints of closed coronal loops or, if along open field lines, could contribute to the solar wind. The site of the sunspot was near a major photospheric magnetic field boundary.

40|$|In {{the modern}} {{understanding}} of turbulence, a central concept is {{the existence of}} cascades of excitations from large to small lengthscales, or vice-versa. This concept was introduced in 1941 by Kolmogorov and Obukhov, and the phenomenon has since been observed {{in a variety of}} systems, including <b>interplanetary</b> <b>plasmas,</b> supernovae, ocean waves, and financial markets. Despite a lot of progress, quantitative understanding of turbulence remains a challenge due to the interplay of many lengthscales that usually thwarts theoretical simulations of realistic experimental conditions. Here we observe the emergence of a turbulent cascade in a weakly interacting homogeneous Bose gas, a quantum fluid that is amenable to a theoretical description on all relevant lengthscales. We prepare a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in an optical box, drive it out of equilibrium with an oscillating force that pumps energy into the system at the largest lengthscale, study the BEC's nonlinear response to the periodic drive, and observe a gradual development of a cascade characterised by an isotropic power-law distribution in momentum space. We numerically model our experiments using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) and find excellent agreement with the measurements. Our experiments establish the uniform Bose gas as a promising new platform for investigating many aspects of turbulence, including the interplay of vortex and wave turbulence and the relative importance of quantum and classical effects.

We show that the scaling exponents of the q-th power of the velocity structure functions, as obtained by the model in the absence of the decorrelation effect, furnishes the best-fit to the data analyzed from the Voyager 2 velocity field measurements at 8. 5 AU.

40|$|Abstract. In nonstationary, strong inhomogeneous or open plasmas {{particle}} orbits {{are rather}} complicated. If the nonstationary time scale {{is smaller than}} the gyration period, if the inhomogeneity scale is smaller than the gyration radius, i. e. at magnetic plasma boundaries, or if the plasma has sources and sinks in phase space, then nongyrotropic distribution functions occur. The stability of such plasma con®gurations is studied {{in the framework of}} linear dispersion theory. In an open plasma nongyrotropy drives unstable waves parallel and perpendicular to the background magnetic ®eld, whereas in the gyrotropic limit the plasma is stable. In nonstationary plasmas nongyrotropy drives perpendicular unstable waves only. Temporal modulation couples a seed mode with its side lobes and thus it renders unstable wave growth more di�cult. As an example of an inhomogeneous plasma a magnetic halfspace is discussed. In a layer with thickness of the thermal proton gyroradius a nongyrotropic distribution is formed which may excite unstable parallel and perpendicular propagating waves.

40|$|Abstract. The {{ubiquity of}} nongyrotropic {{particle}} populations in space plasmas warrants {{the study of}} their characteristics, in particular their stability. The unperturbed nongyrotropic distribution functions in homogeneous media without sources and sinks (closed phase space) must be rotating and time-varying (TNG), whereas consideration of open phase spaces allows for the occurrence of homogeneous and stationary distributions (SNG). The free energy {{brought about by the}} introduction of gyrophase organization in a particle population can destabilize otherwise thoroughly stable magnetoplasmas (or, a fortiori, enhance pre-existing gyrotropic instabilities) and feed intense wave growth both in TNG and SNG environments: The nongyrotropic (electron or ion) species can originate unstable coupling among the gyrotropic characteristic waves. The stability properties of these two types of homogeneous nongyrotropy shall be contrasted for parallel (with respect to the ambient magnetic ®eld) and perpendicular propagation, and their potential role as wave activity sources shall be illustrated resorting to solutions of the appropriate dispersion equations and numerical simulations.
