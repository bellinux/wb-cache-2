5|$|Michael takes Holly on a {{walk through}} the office, {{pointing}} out the locations of various events throughout their courtship. <b>He</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> door to the kitchen, revealing {{all of the other}} employees holding candles. Various members of the office ask Holly if she will marry them (all of Michael's plan) and she politely says no. Michael then leads Holly out to her desk, which is surrounded by dozens of candles. Michael gets down on his knee and begins to make a speech when the sprinklers go off from the candles. The water drenches everyone in the office and Michael proposes. Holly accepts. Everyone then begins to congratulate Michael. However, Michael announces he is moving to Colorado with Holly. The scene ends with his employees in shock.|$|E
5|$|Some months later, {{the town}} has {{constructed}} a statue of the Giant in its memory, friendship, and heroism, and Dean and Annie are starting a relationship. Hogarth receives a package from Rogard, a bolt from the Giant being the only remnant they could find. That night, Hogarth sees the bolt trying to move on its own, and <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> window, letting the bolt roll free. The bolt joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant's head on the Langjökull glacier in Iceland. The Giant's head activates, and he smiles as he puts itself back together.|$|E

5|$|The {{other two}} clones are then {{seen in a}} forest – one walks behind a tree and reappears dressed in casual attire. He climbs another tree and {{ends up in the}} {{bathroom}} of the woman's apartment, where he retrieves a package. The clone then crawls underneath her bed and finds himself underneath a car. <b>He</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> package and finds a gasoline can, which he pours into a compartment located behind the car's license plate. All three clones enter the car and drive to the box, which they step back into; the video concludes with the box's explosion.|$|E
5|$|While seducing three female robots, Bender is {{interrupted}} by a knock at his hotel room door. <b>He</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> door and is knocked unconscious. He awakens to see the Robot Devil and finds himself in Robot Hell. The Robot Devil reminds Bender that he agreed to be punished for sinning when he joined Robotology. After discovering Bender is missing, Fry and Leela track him down using Nibbler's sense of smell. They eventually find the entrance to Robot Hell in an abandoned amusement park. A musical number starts as the Robot Devil begins detailing Bender's punishment. As the song ends, Fry and Leela arrive and try to reason with the Robot Devil on Bender's behalf.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Bart {{plans to}} reveal what he witnessed, but Seymour and Edna {{fear that they}} would be fired if anyone found out and they swear him to secrecy. They hire him as their gofer so they can {{secretly}} exchange messages. Bart agrees for a while because the reward for his cooperation is that Milhouse will inherit Bart's poor school record. Eventually, Bart grows frustrated about his home, school and social life continually being interrupted to help them advance their relationship, putting him in embarrassing situations. One afternoon at school, after he is embarrassed in front of his classmates by having to say one of Seymour's messages to Edna out loud, Bart bitterly gathers the entire school in front of a janitor's closet and <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> door to reveal that Seymour and Edna are making out.|$|E

5|$|Jeffrey {{insists on}} {{returning}} to Dorothy's apartment and tells Sandy to immediately send the police there, including her father. At Dorothy's apartment, Jeffrey finds Dorothy's husband, who is dead from a gunshot {{to the head}} and identifiable by his missing ear, {{as well as the}} Yellow Man, who bears a gruesome head wound, leaving him barely conscious and unresponsive but still standing. When Jeffrey tries to leave, he sees the Well-Dressed Man coming up the stairs and recognizes him as Frank in disguise. Jeffrey talks to Detective Williams over the Yellow Man's police radio, but lies about his location inside the apartment. Frank enters the apartment and brags about hearing Jeffrey's location over his own police radio. While Frank searches for him in the wrong room, Jeffrey retrieves the Yellow Man's gun and hides in the same closet in which he hid during his first visit to the apartment. Frank fires sporadically, knocking over the dead Yellow Man, who had still been standing up, and when <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> closet door, Jeffrey fatally shoots him in the head. Detective Williams, gun drawn, enters with Sandy a moment later. Jeffrey and Sandy now go ahead with their relationship and note the unusual appearance of robins in their town. Dorothy and her son are reunited.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach {{and is thus}} vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, as if trying to listen for each other.|$|E

As this type of figurehead, he also voluntarily abstains from voting in Swedish elections.|$|E
25|$|Another {{characteristic}} that Mendelssohn pioneered is the cyclic form in overall structure. This means the reuse of thematic material from one {{movement to the}} next, to give the total piece coherence. In his second string quartet, <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> piece with a peaceful adagio section in A major, that contrasts with the stormy first movement in A minor. After the final, vigorous Presto movement, {{he returns to the}} opening adagio to conclude the piece. This string quartet is also Mendelssohn's homage to Beethoven; the work is studded with quotes from Beethoven's middle and late quartets.|$|E
25|$|Both the {{temperature}} and the moisture content of the mound are critical to the survival {{and development of the}} eggs, so both are carefully regulated for {{the entire length of the}} breeding season (which may last for as long as eight months), principally by the male. Ornithologists believe that megapodes may use sensitive areas in their mouths to assess mound temperatures; each day during the breeding season, the male digs a pit into his mound and sticks his head in. If the mound's core temperature is a bit low, he adds fresh moist material to the mound, and stirs it in; if it is too high, <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> top of the mound to allow some of the excess heat to escape. This regular monitoring also keeps the mound's material from becoming compacted, which would inhibit oxygen diffusion to the eggs and make it more difficult for the chicks to emerge after hatching. The malleefowl, which lives in more open forest than do other megapodes, uses the sun to help warm its nest as well—opening the mound at midday during the cool spring and autumn months to expose the plentiful sand incorporated into the nest to the sun's warming rays, then using that warm sand to insulate the eggs during the cold nights. During hot summer months, the malleefowl opens its nest mound only in the cool early morning hours, allowing excess heat to escape before recovering the mound completely. One recent study showed that the sex ratio of Australian brushturkey hatchlings correlated strongly with mound temperatures; females hatched from eggs incubated at higher mean temperatures.|$|E

25|$|Leanne {{split up}} with Peter {{and started a}} new {{relationship}} with Nick. They book their wedding for Christmas Day but Leanne visits Peter after Peter confesses he wants her back. Leanne's sister, Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) revealed all at the wedding, causing Nick to leave Leanne. Nick confides in his sister-in-law, Kylie Platt (Paula Lane), and she reveals to him that Eva has been quietly causing trouble between him and Leanne. After a heart to heart, they give into temptation and sleep together. They agree {{that it was a}} mistake. Nick and Leanne reconcile and finally marry– just after Kylie announces she is pregnant. Nick encourages Kylie to have an abortion and she nearly goes through with it. David, who is desperate to start a family, discovers Kylie's pregnancy and stops her. David overhears Kylie talking about her one-night stand with Nick, and begins a vendetta on Nick and Leanne, which includes a poison pen letter to Leanne, stolen money, bad reviews on the internet and watering down the spirits at the Bistro. Nick and David went in the Bistro van and started arguing about the one-night stand with Kylie. David was desperate not to let Nick reveal all to Kylie and Leanne, as David feared losing Kylie if she found out what David had done to take revenge on Nick. David tried to get Nick to stop the van. In the struggle, David removes Nick's seatbelt and stops the van {{in the middle of the}} road, which results in the van being hit by a lorry, knocking them both unconscious. David wakes up shortly after with minor injuries, but Nick does not. Nick is left comatose and has a blood clot removed from his brain. While Nick is in his coma, Kylie gives birth to a baby girl, Lily. When Nick awakes from his coma, he suffers a panic attack when he sees David in front of him. Later, when Nick can talk more fluently, he blackmails David to get Lily a paternity test to see who the father is or he will tell the police and the Platt family how the accident was really caused. David does so, and with his friend Tina, <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> results, revealing that David is the father of baby Lily. Nick later finds life frustrating when he cannot remember simple things. He is discharged from hospital with a walking stick, and goes to live with Leanne. On the day of Lily's christening everything is revealed. Leanne finds out about Nick and Kylie's one-night stand and the entire Platt clan discover that David caused the car accident. They disown David, but Nick is distraught when Leanne flees Weatherfield. She later comes back, but she splits up with Nick after he shouts at Simon and smacks her across the face at Christmas 2013. On the same day, Kylie goes on a drunken rampage and gets arrested. In January 2014, David and Kylie make up.|$|E

500|$|DuBois was a {{prolific}} author. His collection of essays, The Souls of Black Folk, was a seminal work in African-American literature; and his 1935 magnum opus Black Reconstruction in America challenged the prevailing orthodoxy that blacks {{were responsible for}} the failures of the Reconstruction Era. [...] Borrowing a phrase from Frederick Douglass, he popularized {{the use of the term}} color line to represent the injustice of the separate but equal doctrine prevalent in American social and political life. <b>He</b> <b>opens</b> <b>The</b> Souls of Black Folk with the central thesis of much of his life's work: [...] "The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line." ...|$|E

500|$|The end varies, {{depending}} on whom, if anyone, the fledgling allies with. If the fledgling supports LaCroix or Ming-Xiao, each sends the fledgling {{to kill the}} other. LaCroix opens the sarcophagus, to be killed with the fledgling by hidden explosives; Ming-Xiao betrays the fledgling, chaining them to the sarcophagus and sinking it in the ocean. Supporting the Anarchs or no one makes the fledgling kill Ming-Xiao and maim LaCroix, who is killed after <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> sarcophagus. If the fledgling opens the sarcophagus, they die in the explosion. If the fledgling is a Tremere, they kill Ming-Xiao; LaCroix is replaced by Tremere leader Maximillian Strauss, and the sarcophagus is stored. Each ending has Jack watching from afar with the mummy taken from the coffin and the enigmatic taxi driver who transports the fledgling between locations, who says [...] "The blood of Caine controls our fate... Farewell, vampire." ...|$|E
500|$|Themes of {{religious}} salvation and allusions to the Bible appear only briefly in Barton Fink, but their presence pervades the story. While Barton is experiencing his most desperate moment {{of confusion and}} despair, <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> drawer of his desk and finds a Gideon Bible. He opens it [...] "randomly" [...] to , and reads from it: [...] "And the king, Nebuchadnezzar, answered and said to the Chaldeans, I recall not my dream; if ye will not make known unto me my dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in pieces, and of your tents shall be made a dunghill." [...] This passage reflects Barton's inability {{to make sense of}} his own experiences (wherein Audrey has been [...] "cut in pieces"), as well as the [...] "hopes and dreams" [...] of [...] "the common man". Nebuchadnezzar is also the title of a novel that Mayhew gives to Barton as a [...] "little entertainment" [...] to [...] "divert you in your sojourn among the Philistines".|$|E
500|$|None of {{the columns}} after Dunne joined The American Magazine {{attracted}} the attention the earlier ones had, but Mr. Dooley continued {{to comment on the}} issues of the day. [...] Andrew Carnegie was a repeated target, as was John D. Rockefeller, whom Dooley summed up with [...] "he never done anything wrong, save in the way of business" [...] In 1909, during the debates over the Payne–Aldrich Tariff, Dunne examined the bill and came out of it with an exotic item called [...] "divvy-divvy", which Mr. Dooley allowed, [...] "was let in as a compliment to [...] Senator Aldrich. It's his motto." [...] A seventh Dooley book was published in 1910, but given disappointing sales, the publishers abandoned plans for another in 1911. Although Dunne was a strong supporter of Roosevelt in the contentious 1912 presidential election, Mr. Dooley retained his customary above-the-fray attitude, mocking Roosevelt's excited oratory with Dooley feeling there was a large fire somewhere, a mystery solved when <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> newspaper and learns [...] "much to my relief, that it was not my pants but the Republic that was on fire".|$|E
