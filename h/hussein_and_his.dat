25|$|From 1915 to 1916, the British High Commissioner in Egypt, Sir Henry McMahon, corresponded by {{letters with}} Sayyid Hussein bin Ali, {{the father of}} Pan Arabism. These letters, were later known as the Hussein–McMahon Correspondence. McMahon promised <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> Arab {{followers}} {{the territory of the}} Ottoman Empire in exchange for assistance in driving out the Ottoman Turks. Hussein interpreted these letters as promising the region of Palestine to the Arabs. McMahon and the Churchill White Paper maintained that Palestine had been excluded from the territorial promises, but minutes of a Cabinet Eastern Committee meeting held on 5 December 1918 confirmed that Palestine {{had been part of the}} area that had been pledged to Hussein in 1915.|$|E

U.S. forces supported by mortars, artillery, and aircraft continued to attack Iraqi forces still loyal to Saddam Hussein and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers.

500|$|The B-1 {{was first}} used in combat in support of {{operations}} in Iraq during Operation Desert Fox in December 1998, employing unguided GP weapons. B-1s have been subsequently used in Operation Allied Force (Kosovo) and, most notably, in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The B-1's role in Operation Allied Force has been criticized as the aircraft was not used until after enemy defenses had been suppressed by aircraft like the older B-52 {{it was intended to}} replace. The B-1 has deployed an array of conventional weapons in war zones, most notably the GBU-31, [...] Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM). In {{the first six months of}} Operation Enduring Freedom, eight B-1s dropped almost 40 percent of aerial ordnance, including some 3,900 JDAMs. JDAM munitions were heavily used by the B-1 over Iraq, notably on 7 April 2003 in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Saddam <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> two sons. At the height of the Iraq War, a B-1 was continuously kept airborne to provide rapid precision bombardment upon important targets as intelligence identified them. During Operation Enduring Freedom, the B-1 was able to raise its mission capable rate to 79%.|$|E

2500|$|The 1950s {{became known}} as the Arab Cold War, due to the {{conflict}} between states led by Nasserist Egypt and traditionalist kingdoms led by Saudi Arabia. Egypt and Syria formed the United Arab Republic (UAR) on 1February 1958, with the Republic's presidency occupied by Nasser. As a counterweight, <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> cousin, King Faisal II of Hashemite Iraq, established the Arab Federation on 14February 1958 in an Amman ceremony. The two rival entities launched propaganda wars against each other through their radio broadcasts. Jordanian and Syrian forces clashed in March along the border. UAR-inspired conspiracies started to emerge against the Hashemite federation. An officer in Jordan was arrested for plotting to assassinate Hussein. It also emerged in Jordan that the UAR was planning to overthrow both Hashemite monarchies in July of 1958. Jordan reacted by arresting 40 suspected army officers, and Hussein called in Iraqi army chief of staff Rafiq Aref to brief him on the exposed plot. Aref replied [...] "You look after yourselves. Iraq is a very stable country, unlike Jordan. If there is any worries it is Jordan that should be worried." [...] Although Faisal and Hussein enjoyed a very close relationship, Faisal's Iraqi entourage looked down on Jordan; Hussein attributed this attitude to Iraqi crown prince 'Abd al-Ilah's influence.|$|E

2500|$|Movie Maker Magazine {{asked the}} producers, [...] "Voices of Iraq {{is truly a}} {{groundbreaking}} film—both {{in terms of its}} content and the process behind its production. What was your main mission in creating this film?" [...] Eric Manes responded, [...] "Our goal was simply to give the Iraqi people a voice. [...] For years we had heard only the American media’s version of what Iraq and its people were like. We decided that since Iraq was such a major issue in the U.S., it was time to hear their story first-hand. Iraqis are a wonderfully diverse group {{of people who have been}} silenced for over 24 years, living in fear of Saddam <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> regime. We realized we could finally give Iraqis a venue to freely share their lives, hopes and dreams with the rest of the world now that he was no longer in complete control of the country." [...] When questioned on the film's budget, Martin Kunert said, [...] "We used single chip, GR-D30U JVC cameras, which you can buy used on the net for around $230." [...] "Our budget came out to around $500,000. With inexpensive cameras and editing stations, the greatest expense was our post-production staff: translators and assistant editors.

2500|$|As these {{behaviors}} were (and still are) prohibited in Islam, if Hussein had pledged allegiance to Yazid, his act would have ruined {{the basics of}} Islam. Hussein's elder brother Hassan had made a pact [...] that they [...] {{would be responsible for}} religious (i.e., Islamic) decisions and would not interfere in other matters. Hussein wanted to do what had been agreed upon, but YazidI wanted to take total control [...] With the help of Ubayd Allah, YazidI conspires to kill Hussein by sending a letter to him in the name of people of Kufa (Iraq), inviting him to come to Kufa and guide them on the right path, an invitation that was accepted by Hussein; though most historians state that the letters were actually sent by the people of Kufa who later betrayed him when the body of Muslim ibn Aqeel (Hussein's messenger to Kufa) was thrown from a building in the center of Kufa by Yazid's army while the people of Kufa stood silent. In 60AH (680AD), Hussein left Medina for Mecca {{with a small group of}} companions and family members to travel to Kufa. He sent his cousin, Muslim, on ahead to make his decision after the advice of his cousin. But, by the time Hussein arrived near Kufa, his cousin had been killed. On the way , <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> group were intercepted. They were forced into a detour and arrived in Karbala on the 2nd of Muharram, 61AH. Hussein's camp was surrounded and cut off from the Euphrates river. The camp ran out of water on the 7th of Muharram.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2013, the Islamic Da'wah Centre of South Australia {{questioned}} the [...] "reliability, independence and veracity" [...] of the Middle East Media Research Institute after it posted what the centre called a [...] "sensational de-contextualised cut-and-paste video clip... {{put together in}} a suggestive manner" [...] of a sermon by the Sheikh Sharif Hussein on an American website. According to the two-minute video, which was a heavily condensed version of the Sheikh's 36-minute speech delivered in Adelaide on 22 March, Hussein called Australian and American soldiers [...] "crusader pigs" [...] and stated [...] "O Allah, count the Buddhists and the Hindus one by one. O Allah, count them and kill them to the very last one." [...] According to MEMRI's translation, he also described US President Barack Obama as an [...] "enemy of Allah, you who kiss the shoes and feet of the Jews" [...] and predicted that [...] "The day will come when you are trampled upon by the pure feet of the Muslims." [...] MEMRI's rendition moved leading Liberal senator Cory Bernardi to write to the Police Commissioner charging that under Australia's anti-terrorism laws, the video clip was [...] "hate speech", and requesting that action be taken against Hussein. [...] The South Australian Islamic Society and the Australian Buddhist Councils Federation also condemned Hussein's speech. Widespread calls from the public for the deportation of <b>Hussein</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family followed news reports of the video. [...] A police spokeswoman stated [...] "Police will examine the entire content of the sermon to gain the full context and determine whether any crime has been committed." [...] Hussein himself declined any comment on {{the contents of the}} video. However, the Da'wah Centre charged that by omitting the context of Hussein's statements, MEMRI had distorted the actual intent of the speech. While admitting that the Sheikh was emotional and used strong words, the Centre stated that the speech was delivered in relation to rape cases in Iraq, the birth defects due to use of depleted uranium and the Burmese Buddhist massacre. This, the Centre claimed, was omitted from the edited MEMRI video.|$|E
