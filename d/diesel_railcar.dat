25|$|A shorter journey, the Pichi Richi Explorer, is {{a return}} service to Woolshed Flat departing from Quorn (32 {{kilometres}} return). Travel on this train is either in South Australian Railway carriages circa 1900 to 1915 hauled by a steam locomotive, or in a 1928 SAR <b>diesel</b> <b>railcar.</b> The use of older SAR rollingstock on this train replicates {{what it was like}} to travel by country rail in South Australia in the very early 1900s to the 1960s. Much of this rolling stock was in service until the end of narrow gauge passenger operations by the South Australian Railways.|$|E
25|$|In the frugal {{years that}} {{followed}} {{the end of the}} war, Allhallows, like Leysdown-on-Sea, began to experience lean times as passenger numbers fell. Allhallows with its single Charringtons pub, concrete road, two small refreshment stands (closed in winter) and block of four small shops (which never saw any real use and were eventually bricked up) was no match for Brighton, the attractions of which could be enjoyed by rail for an extra 1s 9d when compared to the price of an Allhallows ticket (then 5s 9d). In an attempt to stem losses, the new operator, British Railways (Southern Region) (BR), misguidedly tried out an ACV lightweight <b>diesel</b> <b>railcar</b> in late 1953, its noise and general lack of comfort probably serving however to drive away more passengers.|$|E
500|$|The {{first and}} most {{spectacular}} outcome occurred in 1928, when the Pacifics were called upon daily to work the Flying Scotsman train non-stop over the [...] between London and Edinburgh. Initially three A1s and two A3s took turns on this service. The modifications also gave the A1 locomotives greater speed potential, and the proof of this came in 1933 when a high-speed 3-car <b>diesel</b> <b>railcar</b> service had been mooted. As this would have provided limited accommodation for passengers, it was proposed to use steam traction at similar service speeds with six carriages. A trial return run between London and Leeds was made with modified A1 locomotive number 4472, Flying Scotsman; on the return trip with 6coaches weighing [...] it attained [...] (160km/h) just outside [...] in Lincolnshire for just over [...] There were earlier claims to this speed, notably by the Great Western locomotive 3440 City of Truro, but this 1933 run is {{generally considered to be}} the first reliably recorded instance.
