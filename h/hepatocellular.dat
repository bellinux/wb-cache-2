5|$|Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas are classically well to {{moderately}} differentiated adenocarcinomas. Immunohistochemistry {{is useful}} in the diagnosis and {{may be used to}} help differentiate a cholangiocarcinoma from <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma and metastasis of other gastrointestinal tumors. Cytological scrapings are often nondiagnostic, as these tumors typically have a desmoplastic stroma and, therefore, do not release diagnostic tumor cells with scrapings.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma and liver metastasis. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients can usually be discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E
5|$|Children {{are less}} likely than adults to clear the infection. More than 95% of people who become {{infected}} as adults or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus. However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection. This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma. Of those infected between the age of one to six, 70% will clear the infection.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} {{paracetamol}} overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, <b>hepatocellular</b> supplies of glutathione become depleted, as {{the demand for}} glutathione is higher than its regeneration. NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with cellular membrane molecules, resulting in widespread hepatocyte damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis. In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{components}} of the 19S particle have their own regulatory roles. Gankyrin, a recently identified oncoprotein, {{is one of the}} 19S subcomponents that also tightly binds the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4 and {{plays a key role in}} recognizing ubiquitinated p53, via its affinity for the ubiquitin ligase MDM2. Gankyrin is anti-apoptotic and has been shown to be overexpressed in some tumor cell types such as <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|During HBV infection, {{the host}} immune {{response}} causes both <b>hepatocellular</b> damage and viral clearance. Although the innate immune response does {{not play a}} significant role in these processes, the adaptive immune response, in particular virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTLs), contributes to most of the liver injury associated with HBV infection. CTLs eliminate HBV infection by killing infected cells and producing antiviral cytokines, which are then used to purge HBV from viable hepatocytes. Although liver damage is initiated and mediated by the CTLs, antigen-nonspecific inflammatory cells can worsen CTL-induced immunopathology, and platelets activated at the site of infection may facilitate the accumulation of CTLs in the liver.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{disease may}} present itself as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E
25|$|Since {{hepatitis}} B or C {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma, prevention of this infection is key to then prevent <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma. Thus, childhood vaccination against hepatitis B may reduce the risk of liver cancer in the future.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{outcome is}} poor, because only 10–20% of <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinomas {{can be removed}} {{completely}} using surgery. If the cancer cannot be completely removed, the disease is usually deadly within 3 to 6 months. This is partially due to late presentation with tumors, but also the lack of medical expertise and facilities in the regions with high HCC prevalence. However, survival can vary, and occasionally people will survive much longer than 6 months. The prognosis for metastatic or unresectable <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma has recently improved due to the approval of sorafenib (Nexavar®) for advanced <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Small {{increases}} are also {{seen in the}} rates of cervical cancer and <b>hepatocellular</b> (liver) tumours.|$|E
25|$|Hepcortespenlisimut-L, an oral {{cancer vaccine}} also has US FDA orphan drug {{designation}} for <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} if {{screening}} those with chronic liver disease for <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma improves outcomes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hepatocellular</b> carcinoma, {{like any}} other cancer, {{develops}} {{when there is a}} mutation to the cellular machinery that causes the cell to replicate at a higher rate and/or results in the cell avoiding apoptosis. In particular, chronic infections of hepatitis B and/or C can aid the development of <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma by repeatedly causing the body's own immune system to attack the liver cells, some of which are infected by the virus, others merely bystanders. While this constant cycle of damage followed by repair can lead to mistakes during repair which in turn lead to carcinogenesis, this hypothesis is more applicable, at present, to hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C causes HCC through the stage of cirrhosis. In chronic hepatitis B, however, the integration of the viral genome into infected cells can directly induce a non-cirrhotic liver to develop HCC. Alternatively, repeated consumption of large amounts of ethanol can have a similar effect. The toxin aflatoxin from certain Aspergillus species of fungus is a carcinogen and aids carcinogenesis of <b>hepatocellular</b> cancer by building up in the liver. The combined high prevalence of rates of aflatoxin and hepatitis B in settings like China and West Africa has led to relatively high rates of <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma in these regions. Other viral hepatitides such as hepatitis A have no potential to become a chronic infection and thus are not related to <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Liver cancer* {{is usually}} metastatic in dogs. Primary tumors are and include benign <b>hepatocellular</b> adenoma (hepatoma) and {{malignant}} hepatic carcinoids.|$|E
25|$|Young adults {{afflicted by}} the rare fibrolamellar variant of <b>hepatocellular</b> {{carcinoma}} may {{have none of}} the typical risk factors, i.e. cirrhosis and hepatitis.|$|E
25|$|Neoplasms {{have been}} {{described}} with prolonged exposure to some medications or toxins. <b>Hepatocellular</b> carcinoma, angiosarcoma, and liver adenomas are the ones usually reported.|$|E
25|$|The risk of <b>hepatocellular</b> {{carcinoma}} in type 2 diabetics {{is greater}} (from 2.5 to 7.1 times the non diabetic risk) {{depending on the}} duration of diabetes and treatment protocol. A suspected contributor to this increased risk is circulating insulin concentration such that diabetics with poor insulin control or on treatments that elevate their insulin output (both states that contribute to a higher circulating insulin concentration) show far greater risk of <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma than diabetics on treatments that reduce circulating insulin concentration. On this note, some diabetics who engage in tight insulin control (by keeping it from being elevated) show risk levels low enough to be indistinguishable from the general population. This phenomenon is thus not isolated to diabetes mellitus type 2 since poor insulin regulation {{is also found in}} other conditions such as metabolic syndrome (specifically, when evidence of non alcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD is present) and again there is evidence of greater risk here too. While there are claims that anabolic steroid abusers are at greater risk (theorized to be due to insulin and IGF exacerbation), the only evidence that has been confirmed is that anabolic steroid users {{are more likely to have}} <b>hepatocellular</b> adenomas (a benign form of HCC) transform into the more dangerous <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hepatocellular</b> {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{the most}} common type of primary liver cancer in adults, and {{is the most}} common cause of death in people with cirrhosis.|$|E

25|$|Two small mtDNA insertions of ~260 and ~520 bp can {{be present}} in breast cancer, gastric cancer, <b>hepatocellular</b> {{carcinoma}} (HCC) and colon cancer and in normal cells. No correlation between these insertions and cancer are established.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hepatocellular</b> {{carcinoma}} is {{a primary}} liver cancer that {{is more common in}} people with cirrhosis. People with known cirrhosis are often screened intermittently for early signs of this tumor, and screening has been shown to improve outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Further {{diagnostic}} tests of affected organs may be required, such as nerve conduction studies for neuropathy or an ultrasound of the liver. Basic biochemical tests may assist in identifying liver disease, <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma, and other organ problems.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{with the}} acute porphyrias (AIP, HCP, VP) are at {{increased}} risk over their life for <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma (primary liver cancer) and may require monitoring. Other typical risk factors for liver cancer need not be present.|$|E
25|$|Increased H19 {{expression}} {{is found in}} the following cancers: adrenocortical neoplasms, choriocarcinomas, <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinomas, bladder cancers, ovarian serous epithelial cancers, head and neck carcinomas, endometrial cancer, breast cancer, acute T cell leukemia/lymphoma, Wilms' tumor, testicular germ cell cancer, esophageal cancer and lung cancer.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{is a small}} (55–65 nm in size), enveloped, positive-sense {{single-stranded}} RNA virus of {{the family}} Flaviviridae.

25|$|Cancer, a {{very common}} and {{sometimes}} fatal cause of unexplained (idiopathic) weight loss. About one-third of unintentional weight loss cases are secondary to malignancy. Cancers to suspect in patients with unexplained weight loss include gastrointestinal, prostate, hepatobilary (<b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma, pancreatic cancer), ovarian, hematologic or lung malignancies.|$|E
25|$|Children and {{adolescents}} {{are unlikely to}} have chronic liver disease, however, if they suffer from congenital liver disorders, this fact increases the chance of developing <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma. Specifically, children with biliary atresia, infantile cholestasis, glycogen-storage diseases, and other cirrhotic diseases of the liver are predisposed to developing HCC in childhood.|$|E
25|$|Liver {{cirrhosis}} (with {{an increased}} risk of <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma) Liver disease is always preceded by evidence of liver dysfunction including elevated serum enzymes specific to the liver, clubbing of the fingers, leuconychia, asterixis, hepatomegaly, palmar erythema and spider naevi. Cirrhosis can also present with jaundice (yellowing of the skin) and ascites.|$|E
25|$|A {{systematic}} review assessed 12 articles involving {{a total of}} 318 patients with <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma treated with Yttrium-90 radioembolization. Excluding a study of only one patient, post-treatment CT evaluation of the tumor showed a response ranging from 29 to 100% of patients evaluated, with all but two studies showing a response of 71% or greater.|$|E
25|$|Chemoembolization for <b>Hepatocellular</b> Carcinoma: CBCT with {{contrast}} {{confirms that}} the proper artery is selected to deliver the therapy. The contrast enhances the parenchyma supplied by the selected artery and therefore reveals if the vasculature also supplies the tumor. Post treatment noncontrast CBCT confirms lipiodol staining of the tumor, which improves operator confidence of complete tumor coverage or further treatment.|$|E
25|$|The Eph receptors were {{initially}} identified in 1987 following {{a search for}} tyrosine kinases with possible roles in cancer, earning their name from the erythropoietin-producing <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma cell line from which their cDNA was obtained. These transmembranous receptors {{were initially}} classed as orphan receptors with no known ligands or functions, and it was some time before possible functions of the receptors were known.|$|E
25|$|In this pattern, <b>hepatocellular</b> {{necrosis}} {{is associated}} with infiltration of inflammatory cells. There can be three types of drug-induced hepatitis. (A) viral hepatitis is the most common, where histological features are similar to acute viral hepatitis. (B) in focal or non-specific hepatitis, scattered foci of cell necrosis may accompany lymphocytic infiltration. (C) chronic hepatitis {{is very similar to}} autoimmune hepatitis clinically, serologically, and histologically.|$|E
25|$|Microscopically, {{there are}} four {{architectural}} and cytological types (patterns) of <b>hepatocellular</b> carcinoma: fibrolamellar, pseudoglandular (adenoid), pleomorphic (giant cell) and clear cell. In well-differentiated forms, tumor cells resemble hepatocytes, form trabeculae, cords, and nests, and may contain bile pigment in the cytoplasm. In poorly differentiated forms, malignant epithelial cells are discohesive, pleomorphic, anaplastic, giant. The tumor has a scant stroma and central necrosis because of the poor vascularization.|$|E
25|$|Certain benign liver tumors, such as <b>hepatocellular</b> adenoma, may {{sometimes}} {{be associated with}} coexisting malignant HCC. There is limited evidence for the true incidence of malignancy associated with benign adenomas; however, the size of hepatic adenoma is considered to correspond to risk of malignancy and so larger tumors may be surgically removed. Certain subtypes of adenoma, particularly those with β-catenin activation mutation, are particularly associated with increased risk of HCC.|$|E
