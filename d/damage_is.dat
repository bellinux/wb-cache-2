5000|$|Judge Raymond Jack QC {{held that}} the Government {{had no right to}} {{rescission}} or damages. The contract could not have been rescinded because the plane had been sold. So counter restitution was impossible. It followed that s 2(2) <b>damages</b> <b>were</b> unavailable, because <b>damages</b> <b>are</b> dependent according to the provision's wording on the right to rescission. <b>Damages</b> <b>are</b> available only as a substitute for rescission when the court believes <b>damages</b> <b>are</b> more equitable as a solution. Judge Raymond Jack QC said, ...|$|R
50|$|Punitive <b>damages</b> <b>are</b> often awarded if {{compensatory}} <b>damages</b> <b>are</b> deemed {{an inadequate}} remedy.

Punitive <b>damages</b> <b>are</b> most important for violations {{of the law that}} are hard to detect.|$|R

2500|$|Punitive or {{exemplary}} <b>damages</b> <b>are</b> used {{to punish}} the party at fault; but even though such <b>damages</b> <b>are</b> not intended primarily to compensate, nevertheless the claimant (and not the state) receives the award. [...] Exemplary <b>damages</b> <b>are</b> not recognised nor permitted in some jurisdictions. [...] In the UK, exemplary <b>damages</b> <b>are</b> not available for breach of contract, but are possible after fraud. [...] Although vitiating factors (such as misrepresentation, mistake, undue influence and duress) relate to contracts, they are not contractual actions, and so, in a roundabout way, a claimant in contract {{may be able to}} get exemplary damages.|$|R

In the absence of an out-of court settlement, unliquidated <b>damages</b> must <b>be</b> ascertained by a court or tribunal, whereas liquidated <b>damages</b> will <b>be</b> determined by reference to the contract or to a mutually agreed arbitrator. The purpose of liquidated <b>damages</b> <b>is</b> to provide certainty and to avoid both the bother and cost of legal proceedings.|$|R
