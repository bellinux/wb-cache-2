There were found wind damages that occurred in the last 15 years. Damages were determined from reports of state of forestry management and from reports of agency forest protection. The method was tested in two locations (in Kostelec and in Bělčice). During testing was wire rope changed for fabric rope, which has better qualities and it is safer. <b>Round</b> <b>slings</b> were placed near to the centre of tree crown, then was tied fabric rope, strain gauge with data logger and hook from the winch rope.

50|$|The Anglo-Spanish War in 1585-1604 {{was partly}} due to trade {{disputes}} in the New World.

5000|$|Harrison {{was born}} in Mississippi during a time that was racially oppressive for an African-American female.

Twoscore of manuscripts were travelling the <b>endless</b> <b>round</b> of the magazines. How did the others do it?

Comics historian Andy Madura commented, [...] "Beginning in late 1925, Etta Kett was another of the flapper strips stemming from the 1920s. Like those that survived the era, Etta Kett had to metamorphosize away from the frivolous flapper mentality to attract Great Depression and beyond readers.

50|$|Filth {{represented}} an antidote, {{a form of}} purification, a crude and cruel beauty, desolate, uncivilized. In his world of sexual chaos, filth exited him; debauchery was the closest image to himself and symbolized Existential isolation: cheap, enjoyable, illicit, while the deeper loathing for his body was symptomatic of existential sickness.Abdel Rahman Sartre's wealth allowed him to reinvent his pain, his inadequacies, his persona. With groupies living off the largesse of their philosopher king, no one contradicted him even in the simplest matters. This, the narrator maintains in sweeping statement, characterized the entire generation of the 1960s. A difference of opinion implied rejection; it annihilated and humiliated the contender which inevitably resulted in an <b>endless</b> <b>round</b> of insults. So much for discourse.|$|R

Yet can pains last, when bodies cannot last? Can earthy substance endless flames endure? Or, when one body wears and flits away, Do souls thrust forth another crust of clay, To fence and guard their tender forms from fire? I feel my heart-strings rend!--I'm here,--I'm gone!

40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} the controversial {{question of whether}} happy minds gain happiness by cultivating positive illusions, that is, views of self that exaggerate one’s good qualities and degree of control over life and that involve unrealistically optimistic outlooks. Much evidence indicates that positive illusions contribute to well-being, but there are limits and contrary findings, {{and it is not}} viable to claim that engaging in <b>endless</b> <b>rounds</b> of self-flattering self-deception is a reliable guide to happiness. Illusions do confer benefits, including self-fulfilling prophecies and interpersonal appeal. We contrast two theories: a direct route by which self-deception makes one happy, and an indirect route by which positive illusions contribute to pragmatic, objective benefits, which in turn increase happiness. The evidence is mixed as to which route is more relevant. We note some negative effects of positive illusions, such as when they reduce effort and achievement...|$|R
50|$|The show is {{composed}} of two acts linked only by the common theme of love and one song performed in both acts. The first, The Little Comedy, {{is based on a}} short story by Arthur Schnitzler and explores the budding relationship between two people who have adopted personas other than their own. Set in late 19th century Vienna, it focuses on Josefine, a demimonde weary of the social life provided by her upper class lovers, and wealthy playboy Alfred, who has tired of a seemingly <b>endless</b> <b>round</b> of inconsequential affairs. She assumes the guise of a working class woman, while he pretends to be a struggling poet, and the two meet while enjoying their new identities. Whether or not they can survive a weekend in the country with their usually glamorous trappings replaced by inedible food, bad wine, swarming insects, and total boredom is the question to be answered.|$|R
40|$|What better {{image for}} a Cook Islands tivaevae than {{the vision of}} this {{colorful}} messenger embellishing the fabric 2 ̆ 7 s design in a magical moment of trust and oblivion?

The applique or patchwork tivaevae most representative of this genre appear to have been vigorously brushed by the mythical bird 2 ̆ 7 s feathers and left shimmering in an array of color. Cook Islands women who have created these patterns speak a language of hue and intensity, of flower and butterfly - not necessarily one shaped by words. Colors resonate while patterns shift from figure to ground in an <b>endless</b> <b>round</b> of interplay between the two. Aesthetically, these visual effects characterize the applique style of tivaevae termed tivaevae manu rendered in florid colors and opulent, rich imagery upon a contrasting ground fabric...|$|R
50|$|Chisholm {{began his}} service with the 91st on 16 September 1903 as its {{paymaster}} holding {{the rank of}} honorary captain.

Two evenings a week, Chisholm could be found at the James Street Armouries — the 91st was quartered in the recently built addition (designed in part by his architect brother-in-law Walter Wilson Stewart, {{also a member of the}} 91st). As well as the matters of weekly administration, there was an <b>endless</b> <b>round</b> of ceremonial functions and Chisholm took (and maintained) a particular interest in the Pipe Band. Finally, the 91st provided a rich social life in the elegant officers' mess, whether the normal course of socializing after weekly parades, full mess dinners, special functions, balls, or the annual celebration of Hogmanay.|$|R
40|$|In this assured début about {{loneliness}} and passion in Africa, Sue Eckstein enthrals with a deliciously intricate plot, compelling characters and razor-sharp dialogue. West Africa {{in the early}} 1990 s.

Rebelling against the <b>endless</b> <b>rounds</b> of cocktail parties, golf and gossip, he finds himself drawn to people and places that lie way beyond the experience of his High Commission colleagues – and specifically to the dusty warehouse {{in the heart of the}} city where a thin white woman is silently measuring out lengths of brightly coloured cloth...|$|R
40|$|The {{language}} of anti-parliamentarianism. Poetry {{and politics in}} the Netherlands 1870 - 1940 ‘The {{language of}} anti-parliamentarianism’ discusses the intertwinement between Dutch political history during {{the late nineteenth century}} and the interwar period and experiments in poetry that were going on at the same time. Doubts were expressed both inside and outside parliament about the power and possibilities of language. Politics was often criticized as a futile activity consisting of <b>endless</b> <b>rounds</b> of debates and meetings. This criticism was levelled at Parliament in particular; the symbol of political rhetoric and the bastion of (liberal) civilisation. Indeed, it was in the realm of poetry that the boundaries of language were explored: What if the accepted rules and forms were abandoned? And what if language itself was abandoned? Rhetorically, there was a solution: the act. ‘Acting’, however, had been discredited as it had descended into violence during the Second World War and the Holocaust. Thereafter, language once again became the only legitimate weapon in politics. </p...|$|R
