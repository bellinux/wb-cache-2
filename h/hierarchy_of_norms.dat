In this way, Kelsen contends, the bindingness of legal norms, their specifically 'legal' character, can be understood without tracing it ultimately to some suprahuman source such as God, personified Nature or a personified State or Nation.|$|E

40|$|The {{title of}} this Essay should inspire confidence. Religious freedom is the norm, {{restrictions}} are the exception. That is how religious freedom usually is perceived in a modern democratic society. And yet religious freedom is never fully achieved. Even if sometimes restrictions are unavoidable, they always constitute a danger, as any restriction inevitably results in less freedom. After a short overview concerning the <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> <b>norms</b> in Belgium, I shall deal with limitations of religious freedom on three different levels. The first level deals with solemn principles and main ideas, including both the international framework and constitutional law. The second level goes into the viewpoint of the ordinary legislator and tries to elucidate the question whether, and to what extent, ordinary legislation limits religious freedom. Finally, the last level concerns the more elusive domain of concrete policy, of administrative practice at a lower level. It is often {{the place where the}} main principles of the system and so called common sense cross paths.

40|$|Taking global {{prescriptions}} for national infrastructure regulation {{as a case}} study, this Article examines the nature and implications of the mingling of law, governance, and economic that is increasingly prevalent in global regulatory governance. It focuses on three sets of formally non-binding but influential instruments issued in the 2000 s by the World Bank, the OECD, and UNCITRAL, each of which promotes far-reaching reforms to existing national public law and institutions. The Article excavates these instruments 2 ̆ 7 unarticulated theories {{of the state and}} its roles, and their visions of the nature and preferred features of law. It explores the use by these instruments <b>of</b> law-like <b>hierarchies</b> <b>of</b> <b>norms</b> and their deployment of legal concepts within a hybrid vocabulary of law, economics, and policy disciplines. This may amount merely to ersatz normativity. But this Article posits that, by bringing discourses of public law and regulatory governance into relation, instruments of this kind could open possibilities for renovation of traditional public law within the state through the opening to an incipient global public law. The production and use of these instruments largely escapes the reach of orthodox public and private international law, and of national constitutional or administrative law. Conceivably, global public law could transform the ways in which such prescriptions are developed, and their invocation in particular cases, and might eventually contribute to the reimagination or reinvigoration of public law as a distinct mode of ordering. To assess whether these are possibilities, we take the infrastructure provisions as a 2 ̆ 2 hard case 2 ̆ 2 against which to analyze two approaches to global public law: 2 ̆ 2 international public authority 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 7 global administrative law. 2 ̆ 2 The infrastructure case illustrates significant limits in the current doctrinal framings and institutional specificities of these approaches, and indicates the importance of future struggles among multiple different political and legal projects concerning the roles of law in global regulatory governance...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} and {{illustrate}} novel data {{on more than}} a century of regulation in Switzerland. We provide quantitative measures for Swiss cantons on the annual stock of legally binding rules from 2006 - 2013 and on regulatory activity as reflected in the annual changes to such regulation from 1908 - 2013. We measure the stock of regulation by the number of enactments and characters, and the regulatory activity by the number of changed enactments and pages. Further, we break down the measures by the level in the <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>norms</b> and by the issuing authority. The data reveal substantial cantonal heterogeneity in the stock of regulation and the amount and development of regulatory activity. Regulatory activity generally increased over the century, though in a non-monotonic manner, and is characterized by substantial volatility. Quantitatively, the most important is regulation at the level of decrees. When focusing on the issuing authority, it is the executive that dominates.

The new Constitution had been under discussion since 1989, but several earlier attempts to adopt a new constitution had failed. According to the new constitutional provisions, constitutional amendments may only be proposed by at least one-fifth of the statutory number of Sejm deputies, by the Senate, or by the President of the Republic.

40|$|The paper {{critically}} {{examines the}} impact of the <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> <b>norms</b> within the EU legal order, and its interaction with the pre-emption principle, on the constitutional function of the Court of Justice.

The standards applied to the fundamental freedoms are contrasted to the Court’s approach to the tax law area. The paper questions whether the latter may be evidence of a tax exceptionalism. It is suggested that if this is the case, the Court of Justice should abandon its exceptional approach to the field of taxation and align its standards with the ones applied to other internal market policy areas which have been subject to EU harmonisation measures, such as the free movement provisions...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the United Nation Security Council (SC) counter-terrorism measures, giving {{focus to the}} 1267 sanctions regime against individuals associated with terrorism. The procedures of the 1267 sanctions regime are critically reviewed, {{with the aim of}} indicating the human rights concerns, particularly relating to the fundamental procedural rights. The tension between human rights and the security interest behind the counter-terrorism measures is analyzed. Special importance is given {{to the nature of the}} sanctions measures, arguing them to be punitive and not only preventative measures. Thus, this study aims to argue that procedural rights should be guaranteed in the 1267 sanctions regime in accordance with human rights law. Secondly, this study aims to present constitutionalization of international community based on legal responsibility, which is reviewed through the progressive work of the International Law Commission. Firstly, the question of responsibility of the United Nations (UN) for the breaches of human rights obligations is analyzed, including the initial question of whether or not the human rights norms are binding towards the UN. Secondly, the focus is turned to the responsibility of the bodies implementing the SC 1267 sanctions measures. The question of responsibility for the implementation will be analyzed from two perspectives: first, from an international constitutionalist approach advocating for the <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> <b>norms</b> in the international community. While the traditional <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> <b>norms</b> invests supremacy to the UN Charter, the constitutionalist approach will lead to the question of responsibility for the implementation in accordance with the UN Charter obligations. When implementation measures, taken by another international or regional organization, are not in accordance with the 1267 sanctions regime obligations, the rules on responsibility will become applicable towards the organization. The second perspective for the responsibility of the implementation measures is the international pluralist approach relying on different legal orders acting parallel to each other. In connection with this perspective the question of State responsibility for circumventing its international obligations is analyzed. Third part of this study presents today’s international community after the improvements the UN has taken under the pressure of the decentralized challenges it has encountered concerning the 1267 sanctions regime. This study argues that even though the UN procedures regarding the 1267 sanctions regime have improved, they are still inadequate to accommodate the human rights concerns, particularly fundamental procedural rights, and that the constitutionalization of the international community requires rules on legal responsibility such as the ones the International Law Commission has drafted...|$|E
