40|$|One of {{the major}} {{implications}} of La Nina meteorological variability is the increase in frequency of extreme meteorological events, especially rainfall. In 2011 and 2012, southeast Queensland endured several extreme weather events, which resulted in major flood events in Brisbane, Toowoomba, Lockyer Valley and areas of the Sunshine Coast. These events prompted an inquiry into flood management practices associated with extreme rainfall. The recommendations from the Flood Inquiry Commission Report included the need for improved modelling of flood behaviour, especially for local areas. As a result, local authorities have now been given responsibility for forecasting flash floods. Accordingly, a project is being undertaken to develop a methodology for deriving a flash <b>flood</b> <b>index</b> using GIS data sets. This study proposes utilisation of high-resolution digital elevation models, land use maps, and derived catchment characteristics. Integrating these data with hydrological and meteorological data and by utilizing commercial and open-source hydrological and GIS tools, the project will derive an index of flash flooding potential. It is envisaged the mapping of a flash <b>flood</b> <b>index</b> will be beneficial to urban and infrastructure planners, risk managers and disaster response or emergency services personnel during extreme and intense rainfall events. This paper presents a preliminary review of available datasets and tools that {{have the potential to}} contribute towards deriving the flash flooding index.

40|$|A {{study has}} been carried out to {{quantify}} changes in <b>flood</b> <b>indices</b> due to possible climate change in catchments from different parts of Europe. 15 regional climate model outputs and 8 different downscaling methods have been implemented. The downscaling methods are generally categorized into change-factor based and bias correction approaches. Different hydrological models have been used in different catchments to simulate daily runoff. A set of <b>flood</b> <b>indices</b> were derived from the daily flows and their changes have been evaluated by comparing the periods 1960 - 1990 and 2070 - 2100. The results show that generally both the magnitude and the volume of the annual peak flows increase in most of the studied catchments, with a couple of catchments in Eastern Europe showing a downward change. The variability of the projected changes across the regional climate models are generally different for the different downscaling methods in different catchments, although no major systematic differences are noticed. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: An {{increase}} in the occurrence of sudden local flooding of great volume and short duration has caused significant danger and loss of life and property in Korea {{as well as many}} other parts of the World. Since such floods usually accompanied by rapid runoff and debris flow rise quite quickly with little or no advance warning to prevent flood damage, this study presents a new flash flood indexing methodology to promptly provide preliminary observations regarding emergency preparedness and response to flash flood disasters in small ungauged catchments. Flood runoff hydrographs are generated from a rainfall-runoff model for the annual maximum rainfall series of long-term observed data in the two selected small ungauged catchments. The relative flood severity factors quantifying characteristics of flood runoff hydrographs are standardized by the highest recorded maximum value, and then averaged to obtain the flash <b>flood</b> <b>index</b> only for flash flood events in each study catchment. It is expected that the regression equations between the proposed flash <b>flood</b> <b>index</b> and rainfall characteristics can provide the basis database of the preliminary information for forecasting the local flood severity in order to facilitate flash flood preparedness in small ungauged catchments...|$|E

40|$|Demand for {{alternative}} fuels {{and the need}} to reduce dependence on fossil fuels have triggered the growth of corn-based ethanol production, which is expected to rise in future years. Transportation of the coproduct distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) from this industry occurs under various environmental conditions. Transporting DDGS is often problematic, because caking between the particles can lead to flow problems. In this study, we have prepared DDGS by combining condensed distillers solubles (CDS) with distillers wet grains and then drying. We investigated the effects of CDS level (10, 15, and 20 %, wb), drying temperature (100, 200, and 300 °C), and cooling temperature (– 12, 25, and 35 °C) on the flowability of the resulting DDGS. Statistical analyses of the resulting data found significant differences among the cooling temperature levels for angle of repose, total flow and <b>flood</b> <b>indices,</b> dispersibility, water activity, and protein dispersibility index. Additionally, significant interaction effects between CDS, drying temperature, and cooling temperature levels for angle of repose, total flow and <b>flood</b> <b>indices,</b> dispersibility, and protein dispersibility index were observed. Response surface regression on selected dimensionless flowability parameters was also applied. However, multivariate PLS regression yielded better results (R² > 0. 8) than response surface plots.

This paper examines the sampling uncertainty of quantile estimates on the basis of pooling groups and using the median as the <b>index</b> <b>flood</b> for both gauged and ungauged sites. Analytical approximations for the variance of the quantile estimates were derived, on the basis of asymptotic theory, and were used to calculate approximate confidence intervals for flood frequency curves obtained using both single-site and pooled analysis at gauged and ungauged sites. A series of bootstrap experiments were conducted to quantify the intersite dependence and to develop generalized expressions {{to be included in the}} analysis. It is shown that the pooled analysis yields narrower confidence intervals than the single-site analysis and that the presence of intersite correlations increases the sampling uncertainty. The method was extended to encompass estimation at ungauged sites in the UK on the basis of a regression model for the <b>index</b> <b>flood,</b> which significantly increases the prediction uncertainty compared with using an estimate of the <b>index</b> <b>flood</b> derived from observations at the target sit...|$|R

40|$|Flow {{duration}} curves (FDCs) determination {{represents the}} key to solve issues related to water resources engineering such as water quality management, hydropower systems design, water use planning, flood management and river and reservoirs regime estimation. FDCs graphically depict {{the amount of water}} resource corresponding to a specific river cross-section. For instance, in the hydroelectric scheme framework, FDCs permit to design a system that could cope with extreme flows, operate efficiently in the medium range of flows and operate at a low power output in the case of low flows. FDCs are easily determined in river cross-sections provided with hydrological gauging stations. However, in ungauged basins flow duration curves evaluation remains a problem to solve, especially in small basins where calibration data are sparse and refer to larger catchments scales. This work investigates a direct method to estimate FDCs using spot measures. Specifically, a graphical regionalization approach based on the <b>flood</b> <b>index</b> method of FDCs is proposed. The approach combines a regional dimensionless flow duration curve with a direct method to estimate the <b>flood</b> <b>index.</b> This is based on the evaluation of the mean annual flow at a specific site through instantaneous flow measurements. The optimal number of instantaneous measures necessary to minimize the error between observed and simulated curves is found. A jack knife procedure is applied to simulate the ungauged basins situation. The method gives indications about the optimal lag frequency and measurement year period.

40|$|Flood {{frequency}} estimation {{is crucial}} in both engineering practice and hydrological research. Regional analysis of flood peak discharges is used for more accurate estimates of flood quantiles in ungauged or poorly gauged catchments. This {{is based on the}} identification of homogeneous zones, where the probability distribution of annual maximum peak flows is invariant, except for a scale factor represented by an <b>index</b> <b>flood.</b> The numerous applications of this method have highlighted obtaining accurate estimates of <b>index</b> <b>flood</b> as a critical step, especially in ungauged or poorly gauged sections, where direct estimation by sample mean of annual flood series (AFS) is not possible, or inaccurate. Therein indirect methods have to be used. Most indirect methods are based upon empirical relationships that link <b>index</b> <b>flood</b> to hydrological, climatological and morphological catchment characteristics, developed by means of multi-regression analysis, or simplified lumped representation of rainfall–runoff processes. The limits of these approaches are increasingly evident as the size and spatial variability of the catchment increases. In these cases, the use of a spatially-distributed, physically-based hydrological model, and time continuous simulation of discharge can improve estimation of the <b>index</b> <b>flood.</b> This work presents an application of the FEST-WB model for the reconstruction of 29 years of hourly streamflows for an Alpine snow-fed catchment in northern Italy, to be used for <b>index</b> <b>flood</b> estimation.

40|$|Abstract. Regional {{frequency}} analyses {{based on}} <b>index</b> <b>flood</b> procedures {{have been used}} within the hydrologic community since 1960. It appears that when the <b>index</b> <b>flood</b> method was first suggested, the <b>index</b> <b>flood</b> was taken to be the at-site population mean, which, in turn, {{in the last two}} or three decades, has been estimated by the at-site sample mean. The objectives of this paper are to investigate the consequences of replacing a population characteristic with its sample counterpart and to propose an analytically correct regional model dubbed as the population <b>index</b> <b>flood</b> (PIF) method. In this method the homogeneity of the region is embedded in the structure of the parameter space of the underlying distribution model. Simulation experiments are conducted to test the proposed PIF method based on the generalized extreme value distribution with parameters estimated using the method of maximum likelihood (MLE) and the method of probability-weighted moments (PWM). Furthermore, in the simulation experiments the PIF method is compared with the Hosking and Wallis [1997] regional estimation scheme (HW scheme). Comparing among all <b>index</b> <b>flood</b> methods investigated herein, the PIF method with parameters estimated using MLE provides the best overall results for the 0. 95 and the 0. 99 quantiles in terms of both bias and root-mean-square error for moderate to sufficiently large sample sizes, but for the 0. 995 quantile the HW scheme seems to perform best for the investigated sample sizes. 1...|$|R

A well-known strategy is to design structured codes such as quasi-cyclic LDPC (QC-LDPC) that allow partiallyparallel decoders. Also, several works show that sequential schedules, such as Layered Belief-Propagation (LBP), converge faster than the traditional flooding schedule. In this paper, we propose a novel low-complexity sequential schedule called Zigzag LBP (Z-LBP). Current LBP schedules do not allow partially-parallel architectures for some codes, such as high-rate codes with small-to-medium blocklengths. Our proposed algorithm can still be implemented in a partially-parallel manner in these codes.

Atmospheric drivers of flood occurrence are reconstructed back to 1872 using an objective weather classification scheme and used to identify four flood rich periods: 1.) 1870 s to 1890 s; 2.) late- 1900 s to mid- 1930 s, 3.) a short spell in the 1980 s, and 4.) late- 1990 s onwards. The recent flood rich period is not unprecedented at the centennial time-scale. Moving towards attribution, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is found to modulate flood propensity, with strongest influence in the west and northwest. At the catchment scale the utility of an attribution framework based on the method of multiple working hypotheses is posited using the Boyne catchment as an exemplar. Results show the complexity of attributing hydroclimatic change at the catchment scale where the system is influenced by internal and external change. This work advances understanding of hydroclimatic flood processes and establishes new datasets that together will be important for better managing current and future flood risk and opens prospects for new management tools in Ireland, especially seasonal hydrological forecasting...|$|R
40|$|The Jena Biodiversity Experiment {{is located}} on a Central European {{mesophilic}} floodplain {{on the banks of}} the Saale River (see further details below). In the main experiment, 82 grassland plots of 20 x 20 m were established from a pool of 60 species belonging to four functional groups (grasses, legumes, tall and small herbs). In May 2002, varying numbers of plant species from this species pool were sown in the plots to create a gradient of plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60 species) and functional richness (1, 2, 3, or 4 functional groups). Plots were maintained by bi-annual weeding and mowing. In June 2013, a natural 200 -year flood event occurred at the field site. Rainfall in May 2013 in Jena was ~ 150 mm, constituting > 25 % of annual precipitation at the site that year. Overall the flood affected the entire Elbe River Basin and much of Europe and was one of the largest natural flooding events in the past two centuries. The flood lasted for a total of 24 days at the site (30 May- 24 June) and led to anaerobic soil conditions. Due to small topographical differences among the plots in the experiment (< 1 m), there was variation in the duration of flooding and the proportion of each plot that was flooded. This variation was well-distributed across the diversity gradient. To assess the importance of flood severity, the proportion of each plot that was flooded was estimated by eye (using five classes: 0 completely dry, 0. 25 up to a quarter under water, 0. 5 half, 0. 75 up to three quarters under water, and 1 more than three quarters under water up to completely submerged). These values, for each of the 24 days that the flood lasted, were summed up to calculate a <b>flooding</b> <b>index.</b> The resulting <b>flooding</b> <b>index</b> is given for each plot of the Main Experiment...|$|R
3000|$|According to the results, as expected, the {{disaster}} resilience leadership index had a statistically significant, {{positive effect on}} the <b>flood</b> resilience <b>index</b> (b[*]=[*]. 731, p[*]<[*]. 001). This suggests that, controlling for the effects of all other predictors, municipalities whose local government leaders possess a higher level of disaster resilience leadership tend to have a higher level of progress in flood resilience building. Each one-point score increase in {{the disaster}} resilience leadership index was on average associated with a [...]. 731 -point score increase in the <b>flood</b> resilience <b>index.</b> In addition, our analysis also reveals that the number of years that local government leaders have worked for the municipality office has a statistically significant, {{positive effect on the}} progress of flood resilience building (b[*]=[*]. 031, p[*]<[*]. 001). However, local government leaders’ educational level and years of residency were not found to be significantly predictive of a city’s progress in flood resilience building.|$|R
