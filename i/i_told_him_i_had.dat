60|$|Yes, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> could hinder <b>him,</b> because <b>I</b> knew {{he could}} no more do an unkind thing by me than he could do an unjust one; and to put {{him out of his}} pain, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> was with child.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> {{believed}} so, {{and that}} it was considered fortifying to Types.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a {{few pounds}} still {{remaining}} to me, but that after that was gone I should be penniless.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come {{up again}} to say how sorry I was that {{anything}} disagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he would not blame me much.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{spent some}} {{years at the}} Royal College of Science, and had done some {{researches}} in biology under Huxley. He raised his eyebrows slightly at that.|$|E

60|$|Comyn demanded {{where the}} devil I had been, {{though he knew}} perfectly. He was uncommonly silent during dinner, and then asked me if I had heard the news. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard none. He took me by the sleeve, to the quiet {{amusement}} of the company, and led me aside.|$|E
