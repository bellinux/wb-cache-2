40|$|Low-grade {{inflammation}} is {{seen with}} obesity and is suggested to be a mediator of insulin resistance. The <b>eliciting</b> <b>factor</b> of low-grade inflammation is unknown but increased perme-ability of gut bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharides (LPS) resulting in endotoxemia {{could be a}} candidate. Here we test the effect of LPS and the anti-inflammatory compound resveratrol on glucose homeostasis, insulin levels and inflammation. Mice were subcutaneously implanted with osmotic mini pumps infusing either low-dose LPS or saline for 28 days. Half of the mice were treated with resveratrol delivered through the diet. LPS caused increased inflammation of the liver and adipose tissue (epididymal and subcutaneous) together with enlarged spleens and increased number of leukocytes in the blood. Resveratrol specifically reduced the inflammatory status in epididymal fat (reduced expression of TNFa and Il 1 b, whereas the increased macrophage infiltration was unaltered) without affecting the other tis-sues investigated. By LC-MS, {{we were able to}} quantitate resveratrol metabolites in epididy-mal but not subcutaneous adipose tissue. LPS induced insulin resistance as the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion during an oral glucose tolerance test was increased despit...|$|E
40|$|Adverse {{reactions}} to food are a frequently discussed cause of urticaria. In acute urticaria 63 % of patients suspect food as the eliciting factor; however, this cannot be confirmed in prospective studies. In adults {{the rate of}} type I allergic reactions is below 1 %, although in children the percentage appears to be higher. Also in chronic urticaria type I allergic reactions play only a minor role as an <b>eliciting</b> <b>factor.</b> The same holds for the physical urticarias. The role of pseudoallergic reactions has not been investigated {{for all types of}} urticaria, but apparently they are not important in physical urticarias; however, in acute urticaria pseudoallergic reactions against NSAID are responsible for approximately 9 % of cases, and in a subset of patients with chronic urticaria a diet low in pseudoallergens has been proven to be beneficial in several studies, with response rates observed in more than 55 % of patients. Double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge tests have shown that artificial food additives are not only to blame, with the majority of reactions being traced back to naturally occuring pseudoallergens in food...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the salivary gland {{structure of the}} {{brown marmorated stink bug}} (Pentatomidae: Halyomorpha halys) and developed methods for independent collection of watery saliva and sheath saliva. This stink bug has become a serious invasive pest of agriculture in the United States and its saliva is largely responsible for the damage it causes. We determined by protein gel analysis and shotgun proteomics that the suite of proteins comprising the sheath and watery saliva are very distinct. Our results indicate that a substantial amount of sheath proteins are derived from tomato when stink bugs feed on tomato fruit. Consequently, the sheath saliva is comprised of both insect and plant-derived proteins. Both sheath and watery saliva possessed amylase activities, but polyphenol oxidase and glucose oxidase activities were not detected in either saliva. Peroxidase activity was only detected in salivary sheaths, but only when stink bugs fed on tomato. Proteomic analysis indicated that the peroxidase was likely of plant origin. We also determined that sheath saliva, but not watery saliva elicited the jasmonate inducible defense gene proteinase inhibitor 2 (Pin 2), but this induction was only observed when sheaths had been collected from tomato. This indicates that the <b>eliciting</b> <b>factor</b> of the saliva is likely of plant origin. Lastly, neither watery or sheath saliva affected the expression of the salicylate inducible gene pathogenesis related gene (Pr 1 a-P 4) ...|$|E

40|$|Background: There are no {{epidemiological}} data available on anaphylaxis in German adults {{and so far}} {{there has been no}} consensus on when to diagnose anaphylaxis, mainly {{due to a lack of}} generally accepted diagnostic criteria. Recently, an international expert group addressed this issue by suggesting new diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis. We addressed the usefulness of the suggested diagnostic criteria in German adults and attempted to identify putative trigger factors. Methods: Medical records were reviewed for patients seen in 2006 who had suffered any reaction that led to the suspicion of anaphylaxis. Clinical reaction patterns, <b>eliciting</b> <b>factors,</b> serum tryptase concentrations, and the applicability of diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis were evaluated. Results: One hundred fi ve patients (78 women and 27 men, aged 18 - 77 years) were included in the study. The <b>eliciting</b> <b>factors</b> were as follows: drugs (46 %), hymenoptera stings (33 %), food (11 %), physical factors (4 %), or unknown (7 %). Ninety-fi ve patients (91 %) fulfi lled criteria for anaphylaxis currently employed in Germany; 58 (58 %) of those patients had grade 2 - 4 reactions. In contrast, only 53 (51 %) —and only 19 / 48 (40 %) of those who reacted to drugs—fulfi lled the newly proposed criteria. Recurrent anaphylactic episodes were found in 15 % of the patients and elevated serum tryptase was observed in 6 %. Conclusion: The main <b>eliciting</b> <b>factors</b> for anaphylaxis were hymenoptera stings, drugs, and food. The application of the newly proposed diagnostic criteria did not identify as many patients with severe immediate-type reactions as the graded score currently employed for diagnosis of anaphylaxis in Germany. Further efforts are needed to extend and standardize diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis. Key words: Anaphylaxis. Diagnosis. Drug allergy. Food allergy. Hymenoptera allergy...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a {{pathology}} {{that has}} structural and histological alterations. The association between CRS and the gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) {{has been widely}} discussed in the last years. For this relationship to be confirmed, {{it is necessary to}} find evidences that the patients with CRS present a major incidence of GERD, that the physiopathology of both diseases explains the association between them and that the GERD treatment cures or improves the CRS' symptoms. Objectives: To evaluate the incidence of GERD in patients with CRS and a level of improvement of the nasosinusal disease symptoms after treatment with protons pump inhibitors. Methods: Retrospective study with 30 patients with CRS refractory to the clinical treatment and/or nasal cavity polypoid pathology with indication of the paranasal sinuses functional endoscopic surgery. We applied a questionnaire for evaluation of the symptomatology and previous treatment for gastroesophageal reflux. The data were submitted to statistical analysis by the Chi-Square test or Fisher's exact test with a significance of 5 %. Results: Out of the patients with GERD, 33 % had an improvement of the CRS' symptomatology with medications for treatment of the gastric pathology. Conclusion: It is not possible yet to state that the GER is a factor responsible for the CRS and it must be researched as a cofactor or <b>eliciting</b> <b>factor</b> when there is not other evident etiology. However, there are plausible biological mechanisms for such association...|$|E

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to explore gender differences in family doctors' views, attitudes, experiences and practices regarding intimate partner abuse against women. METHODS: We used the focus-group method with a stratified, randomized sample of family physicians. Three male and three female groups took part. Two independent researchers analysed the transcripts of the discussions. RESULTS: There were differences between male and female groups in discussing partner abuse, although similarities were also noted. Major contrasts in opinions were seen in (i) the role of sexuality: part of the male family doctors stated that denial of sexual relationships by a spouse was a contributing and <b>eliciting</b> <b>factor</b> to male aggression, whereas female doctors emphasized unanimously the humiliation of sexual coercion and the danger of opposing. (ii) Children as witnesses: this issue was discussed in female groups only, (iii) female doctors talked about emotional involvement with patients and male doctors about keeping distance, (iv) female doctors viewed leaving an abusive partner as a process whilst male doctors saw no progress, (v) experiences with abused patients: female doctors remembered more actual cases and (vi) practices in managing partner abuse differed between men and women. CONCLUSION: These remarkable gender-related differences among doctors might affect care for abused women. Doctors should be aware of gender-related views, attitudes and practices that can be harmful to their patients...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin K-dependent proteases {{generated}} {{in response to}} vascular injury and infection enable fibrin clot formation, but also trigger distinct immuno-regulatory signaling pathways on myeloid cells. Factor Xa, a protease crucial for blood coagulation, also induces protease-activated receptor-dependent cell signaling. Factor Xa can bind both monocytes and macrophages, but whether factor Xa-dependent signaling stimulates or suppresses myeloid cell cytokine production in response to Toll-like receptor activation is not known. In this study, exposure to factor Xa significantly impaired pro-inflammatory cytokine production from lipopolysaccharide-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, THP- 1 monocytic cells and murine macrophages. Furthermore, factor Xa inhibited nuclear factor-kappa B activation in THP- 1 reporter cells, requiring phosphatidylinositide 3 -kinase activity for its anti-inflammatory effect. Active-site blockade, γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain truncation and a peptide mimic of the factor Xa inter-epidermal growth factor-like region prevented factor Xa inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced tumour necrosis factor-α release. In addition, factor Xa anti-inflammatory activity was markedly attenuated {{by the presence of}} an antagonist of protease-activated receptor 2, but not protease-activated receptor 1. The key role of protease-activated receptor 2 in <b>eliciting</b> <b>factor</b> Xa-dependent anti-inflammatory signaling on macrophages was further underscored by the inability of factor Xa to mediate inhibition of tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin- 6 release from murine bone marrow-derived protease-activated receptor 2 -deficient macrophages. We also show for the first time that, in addition to protease-activated receptor 2, factor Xa requires a receptor-associated protein-sensitive low-density lipoprotein receptor to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production. Collectively, this study supports a novel function for factor Xa as an endogenous, receptor-associated protein-sensitive, protease-activated receptor 2 -dependent regulator of myeloid cell pro-inflammatory cytokine production...|$|E

40|$|Oral {{contraceptive}} use is {{a common}} risk factor for venous thromboembolism in women of reproductive age. The presence of inherited thrombophilia further increases this risk. Methods: We analyzed {{a large group of}} 400 Czech women with venous thromboembolism in association with oral contraceptive with regard to dura-tion of use at the time of manifestation of venous thromboembolism, the frequency of inherited and acquired thrombophilia, the frequency of eliciting risk factor for thrombosis including immobilization, sur-gery, administration of plaster cast, long travel, and so on, and the type of thrombosis. The mean age of the women was 26 years, and the average duration of use was 45 months at the onset of thrombosis. Results: Venous thrombosis solely due to the pill occurred in 57 % of the women, and in the other 43 %, an additional transient <b>eliciting</b> <b>factor</b> was recognized. Among the clinical manifestation, distal thrombosis prevailed (N 231, 58 %) followed by proximal deep vein thrombosis (N 65, 16 %), pulmonary embolism (N 21, 5 %), and thrombosis in unusual sites (N 20, 5 %). Inherited or acquired thrombophilia was diag-nosed in 195 (49 %) women: factor V Leiden mutation in 35 %, congenital deficiency of antithrombin in 1. 8 %, protein C in 0. 8 %, protein S in 1 %, F IIG 20210 A in 5 %, and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in 5. 3 %. Among the most common risk factors were immobiliza-tion of lower limb, minor and major surgery, and trauma. Conclusion: The results confirm that venous thromboembolism is a multifactorial disease in which thrombophilia screening is needed in young sympto-matic women on the pill with thrombosis. The results also emphasize the value of proper thromboprophylaxis in women while on oral contraceptive in situations of increased risk for venous thromboembolism...|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} issue of Critical Care, we read with {{interest}} the article on the incidence of hemophagocytic lympho-histiocytosis (HLH) in patients with H 1 N 1 infection [1]. Acquired HLH is associated with infections (particularly viral), malignancy, and auto-immune disorders [2]. We describe a case of HLH in a 66 -year-old woman admitted to the intensive care unit after aortic valve replace ment. She had a history of a cerebral vascular event and diabetes mellitus type 2. After surgery, she had an unexplained increase in oxygen demand and a fever. Standard antibiotics were started for probable ventilator-associated pneumonia and were discontinued after nega-tive cultures. A cardiac evaluation showed good valve patency. Laboratory tests showed elevated creatine kinase (3, 562 U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (1, 380   U/L), ferritin (3, 960 μg/L), and triglyceride (2. 29  mmol/L) and decreased hemoglobin (64   g/L), platelets (54   ×  109 /L), fi brinogen (1. 0 g/L), and haptoglobin (< 0. 2   g/L). Th e results of a Coombs test were negative. Schistocytes were absent. Bone marrow aspiration showed marked hemophago-cytosis. An <b>eliciting</b> <b>factor</b> could not be found. Because criteria for HLH were met, we started prednisone treatment. Our patient made a satisfactory recovery. Fever, thrombocytopenia, and anemia are common after cardiac surgery. Without the fi nding of a markedly elevated ferritin level in our patient, the proper diagnosis could have been missed or her condition could have been misclassifi ed as sepsis with multiple organ failure [3]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the fi rst published case of HLH to occur after cardiac surgery but without a known eliciting cause. Th is raises a tantalizing thought: unknown triggers may have a role in the pathogenesis of HLH. It would be interesting to search for HLH in a cohort of cardiac surgery patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Helicobacter pylori (HP) have {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} novel <b>eliciting</b> <b>factor</b> for chronic urticaria (CU). The possible association between HP and CU has enormous potential, as eradicating HP could cure CU. Aims and Objectives: We conducted a study to assess the prevalence of HP infection and effect of bacterium eradication on skin lesions in patients of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). Settings and Design: Four hundred sixty patients of CU attending the allergy clinic, SMS hospital, Jaipur during the period February 6, 2004, to February 6, 2006, were screened for possible eliciting factors. Patients with CIU were enrolled and others were excluded. Materials and Methods: Sixty-eight patients of CIU and similar number of age and sex matched controls, attending the allergy clinic, SMS Hospital, Jaipur {{were enrolled in the}} study. All patients underwent endoscopy with antral biopsy for urease and histopathology to identify HP-associated gastritis. Infected patients were given HP eradication therapy. Eradication of bacterium was confirmed by fecal antigen assay. Subjective response to treatment was judged using chronic urticaria quality-of-life questionnaire (CU-Q 2 oL) while objective response to treatment was judged by need for &#x 2032;rescue medication&#x 2032; (antihistaminics). Statistical Analysis: Data were analyzed using Chi square and paired&#x 2032;t&#x 2032; test for their level of significance. Results: HP associated gastritis was present in 48 (70. 58 &#x 0025;) patients, out of which 39 (81. 25 &#x 0025;) patients responded to eradication therapy. Ten (50. 00 &#x 0025;) patients without HP associated gastritis showed response to symptomatic therapy. Overall 49 (72. 05 &#x 0025;) patients responded and 19 (27. 94 &#x 0025;) showed no response. The value of &# 967; 2 was 28. 571 (P = 0. 003), which showed significant association between presence of HP and response to eradication regimen.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{elucidate}} pathogenic mechanisms of different forms of human HSV keratitis. HSV infection of the corneal epithelium causes a classical dendritic shaped lesion. Many studies could explain the development and growth in dendritic keratitis, {{but none of these}} found the anatomical substrate for the linear branching pattern. The most obvious explanation would be, that the shape of dendritic ulcers corresponds with the anatomical pattern of innervating nerves of the cornea. In chapter 2 a relationship between the shape of dendritic ulcers in infectious epithelial keratitis and the subbasal nerve plexus of the corneal epithelium is postulated. Recurrence of HSV keratitis is a common complication after PKP for corneal opacities resulting from HSV infection. After PKP, for reasons unrelated to HSV keratitis, epithelial defects may still be caused by HSV. In chapter 3 the incidence of newly acquired HSV keratitis after PKP is determined and possible contributing factors are assessed. Several possibilities as to the origin of the infecting HSV exist. These include reactivation oflatent virus in the trigeminal ganglion, horizontal spread, or transmission through the donor cornea. To test the assumption of graft-to-host transmission of HSV by PKP, surplus corneal material was examined for the presence of HSV DNA. Because the amount of viral DNA available could be very limited, a new method independent of viral culture, was developed to allow distinction between different virus strains. The newly developed technique was used to test our hypothesis that graft-to-host transmission of HSV is possible. This new method was used to determine the incidence of HSV- 1 superinfection in patients with recurrent HSV keratitis. Although HSK has been studied extensively in the mouse model, {{it is not clear what}} triggers the immune response and to what extent the mouse data correlate with findings in human keratitis. The most logical idea, that virus-derived proteins are the <b>eliciting</b> <b>factor</b> for the immune response, has been ruled out in the experimental HSK mouse model. Alternative sources of the keratogenic antigens, like auto-antigens, have been suggested. Data on the pathogenesis of human HSK are limited. Therefore, in chapter 4 the antigenspecificity of corneal T cells in HSK patients was investigated. Besides this, corneas of patients with HSK were examined for the presence of corneal antigen reactive T cells (auto-reactive T cells). Chapter 5 provides a concise summary of the data generated in the framework of this thesis, and concludes with an overall discussion of the data and their possible impact on current ophthalmologic practice...|$|E
40|$|After {{myocardial}} infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock the inflammatory response {{is the result}} of an ischemic insult. Elevated procalcitonin levels, correlated to IL- 6 levels, are triggered by bacterial toxins. In cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) hypoperfusion of the gut may result in a loss of barrier function and as a consequence bacterial endotoxins may enter the systemic circulation. Alkaline phosphatase is capable of detoxifying endotoxins and extracellular nucleotides. Based on the promising results of alkaline phosphatase in the attenuation of the inflammatory response in several studies we focused in this thesis on the effect of bovine Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (bIAP) on the inflammatory response in the field of cardiology and cardiac surgery. In chapter 2 of this thesis the proposed mechanism of endotoxin release during cardiac surgery with the use of CPB is discussed, followed by both material dependent and material independent measures taken throughout the years to diminish endotoxin release. In chapter 3 we investigated the effect of bIAP in {{myocardial infarction}}. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was induced in mice. BIAP was given intravenously. A single dose of bIAP reduced the production of the chymase mMCP- 1 and diminished the systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine response in the acute phase after AMI. In chapter 4 a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study among a total of 63 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with low till intermediate EuroSCORE is discussed. Bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase or placebo was administered as an intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion for 36 hours. Five patients in the placebo group displayed a significant TNFa response followed by an increase in plasma levels of IL- 6 and IL- 8. Such a TNFa response was not observed in the bIAP group, confirming the anti-inflammatory activity of bIAP. In chapter 5 we focused on alkaline phosphatase release. The intravenous administration of bIAP as a bolus followed by continuous infusion to patients undergoing elective CABG with CPB leads to an initial rise of plasma alkaline phosphatase levels followed by a significant increase of plasma alkaline phosphatase at about 4 - 6 hours post start of surgery. This second peak of alkaline phosphatase has an endogenous origin. The most likely source is liver type alkaline phosphatase. To exclude that aprotinin as possible anti-inflammatory agent was the <b>eliciting</b> <b>factor</b> in endogenous alkaline phosphatase release we performed a small study in patients undergoing CABG with the use of CPB, but without the use of aprotinin. This study is described in chapter 6. In this study it is demonstrated that the release of endogenous alkaline phosphatase is not induced by aprotinin, and that it is only induced by bolus bIAP followed by continuous infusion. In piglets bIAP was administered intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously either as a single bolus or as repated bolus twice a day, with an interval of about 8 hours for 3 consecutive days. No endogenous alkaline phosphatase release could be demonstrated in piglet experiments which are described in chapter...|$|E

This guideline was acknowledged and accepted by the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS) and is published in Allergy 2014; 69 : 868 - 887...|$|R
5000|$|By {{taking into}} account {{heightened}} emotion, reaction to the stooge, as well as prompted questions, all these <b>elicited</b> <b>factors</b> provide a negative or positive affect. Although the study took place in 1962, it is still studied in both psychology and communication fields today {{as an example of}} appraisal theory in relation to affect and emotion.Through these findings, Schachter and Singer assess that an event happens which in turn elicits as physiological arousal. From the reasoning of the arousal, you are then able to have an emotion. [...] For example: You are about to give a speech. You approach the podium and look out into the audience as your mouth goes dry, your heart beat quickens, your palms sweat, and your legs begin to shake. From this arousal, you understand you feel this way because you are about to give a speech in front of 50 of your peers. This feeling causes anxiety and you experience the emotion of fear.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade a number of {{community}} based sexual health projects aimed solely at young men {{have proved to be}} very successful at attracting young men into genitourinary medicine services. These projects are often short term funded and under evaluated so it isn't clear exactly how successful they are and why this might be so. These projects should be carefully evaluated and examined to <b>elicit</b> <b>factors,</b> either unique or common in nature, which could be utilised by mainstream sexual health services wishing to develop work with young men. There are many barriers to this happening in mainstream services, some being resource and time problems and others to do with values of staff and lack of quality training. The article looks at practical ways that working with men and the skills and confidence of staff can be improved in mainstream settings while recognising that much of {{what needs to be done}} to support the needs of young men must take place in the planning and commissioning stage of services...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with {{cirrhosis}} display enhanced {{blood levels}} of factor VIII, which may result in harmful activation of the clotting system; however, the underlying mechanism is unknown. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in patients with cirrhosis (n= 61) and matched controls (n= 61) comparing {{blood levels of}} factor VIII, von Willebrand factor (vWf), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and positivity for Escherichia coli DNA. Furthermore, we performed an in vitro study to investigate if LPS, in a concentration range similar to that found in the peripheral circulation of cirrhotic patients, was able to <b>elicit</b> <b>factor</b> VIII secretion from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). RESULTS: Patients with cirrhosis displayed higher serum levels of LPS (55. 8 [42. 2 - 79. 9] vs. 23. 0 [7. 0 - 34. 0]pg/ml, p< 0. 001), factor VIII (172. 0 [130. 0 - 278. 0] vs. 39. 0 [26. 0 - 47. 0]U/dl, p< 0. 0001), vWf (265. 0 [185. 0 - 366. 0] vs. 57. 0 [48. 0 - 65. 0]U/dl, p< 0. 001) and positivity for Escherichia coli DNA (88...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the predictive power of survey-elicited time preferences using {{a representative sample}} of US residents. In regressions controlling for demographics and risk preferences, we show that the discount <b>factor</b> <b>elicited</b> from choice experiments using multiple price lists and real payments predicts various health, energy, and financial outcomes, including overall self-reported health, smoking, drinking, car fuel efficiency, and credit card balance. We allow for time-inconsistent preferences and find that the long-run and present bias discount factors (δ and β) are each significantly associated in the expected direction with several of these outcomes. Finally, we explore alternate measures of time preference. <b>Elicited</b> discount <b>factors</b> are correlated with several such measures, including self-reported willpower. A multiple proxies approach using these alternate measures shows that our estimated associations between the time-consistent discount factor and health, energy, and financial outcomes may be conservative...|$|R

40|$|Most {{developing}} countries have acknowledged the information revolution, although, {{the ability to}} effectively harness the technology varies from country to country. This paper sets to <b>elicit</b> the <b>factors</b> affecting the future development of {{information and communication technologies}} in {{developing countries}}. The forecast will be on the existing Information and Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure with special attention to Zimbabwe as one of the developing countries in southern Africa and tries to figure out opportunities for better technology in future...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: With high {{prevalence}} of sensitive skin (SS), lack of strong evidence on pathomechanisms, consensus on associated symptoms, proof of existence of 'general' SS and tools to recruit subjects, this topic attracts increasing attention of research. OBJECTIVE: To create {{a model for}} selecting subjects in studies on SS by identifying {{a complete set of}} self-reported SS characteristics and factors discriminatively describing it. METHODS: A survey (n +AD 0 - 3058) was conducted, comprising questions regarding socio-demographics, atopy, skin characteristics, personal care, degree of self-assessed SS and subjective and objective reactions to endogenous and exogenous factors. Exploratory factor analysis on 481 questionnaires was performed to identify underlying dimensions and multivariate logistic regression to find contributing variables to the likelihood of reporting SS. RESULTS: The {{prevalence of}} SS was found to be 41 +ACU-, and 56 +ACU- of SS subjects reports a concomitant atopic condition. The most discriminative were the <b>eliciting</b> <b>factors</b> toiletries and emotions, and not specific skin symptoms in general. CONCLUSION: Triggers of different origins seem to elicit SS, it is not defined by concomitant skin diseases only, suggesting existence of 'general' SS. A multifactorial questionnaire could be a better diagnostic than a one-dimensional provocative test...|$|R
40|$|Background: Evidence {{suggests}} patients delay reporting {{symptoms of}} neutropenic sepsis (NS) despite {{the risk to}} their life. This study aimed to <b>elicit</b> <b>factors</b> that contribute to delayed patient reporting of NS symptoms. Methods: A constructivist grounded theory study used observations of chemotherapy consultations (13 hours) and 31 in-depth interviews to explore beliefs, experiences and behaviors related to NS. Participants included women with breast cancer, their carers (partners, family or friends) and clinicians. An explanation for patient delays was developed through theoretical sampling of participants to explore emerging areas of interest and through constant comparison of data and their coding. This entailed iterative and concurrent data collection and analysis. Data were collected until saturation. Results: All patients who developed NS type symptoms delayed presenting to hospital (2. 5 hours - 8 days), sometimes repeatedly. Moderators of delay included metastatic disease, bereavement, fatalism, religious beliefs and quality of relationships with clinicians. There was an interplay of behaviours between clinicians, patients and carers where they subconsciously conspired to underplay the seriousness and possibility of NS occurring. Conclusions: Findings have implications for health risk communication and development of holistic service models...|$|R
