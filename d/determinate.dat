5|$|From {{this model}} of Kantian ethics, O'Neill begins to develop a theory of justice. She argues that the {{rejection}} of certain principles, such as deception and coercion, provides {{a starting point for}} basic conceptions of justice, which she argues are more <b>determinate</b> for human beings that the more abstract principles of equality or liberty. Nevertheless, she concedes that these principles may seem to be excessively demanding: there are many actions and institutions that do rely on non-universalisable principles, such as injury.|$|E
5|$|If {{symptoms}} develop {{during the}} acute phase, they usually resolve spontaneously within three {{to eight weeks}} in approximately 90% of individuals. Although the symptoms resolve, even with treatment the infection persists and enters a chronic phase. Of individuals with chronic Chagas disease, 60–80% will never develop symptoms (called indeterminate chronic Chagas disease), while the remaining 20–40% will develop life-threatening heart and/or digestive disorders during their lifetime (called <b>determinate</b> chronic Chagas disease). In 10% of individuals, the disease progresses directly from the acute form to a symptomatic clinical form of chronic Chagas disease.|$|E

In Stanek's (1958) infrageneric concept, G.pectinatum is placed in section Perimyceliata (encompassing species whereby the mycelial layer covers the entire endoperidium), in subsection Glabrostomata, which includes species with plicate peristomes.|$|E

5|$|The {{symptomatic}} (<b>determinate)</b> chronic stage {{affects the}} nervous system, digestive system and heart. About two-thirds {{of people with}} chronic symptoms have cardiac damage, including dilated cardiomyopathy, which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result in sudden death. About one-third of patients go on to develop digestive system damage, resulting in dilation of the digestive tract (megacolon and megaesophagus), accompanied by severe weight loss. Swallowing difficulties (secondary achalasia) {{may be the first}} symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to malnutrition.|$|E

5|$|Growth {{rates of}} pterosaurs once they hatched varied across {{different}} groups. In more primitive, long-tailed pterosaurs ("rhamphorhynchoids"), such as Rhamphorhynchus, the average growth rate {{during the first}} year of life was 130% to 173%, slightly faster than the growth rate of alligators. Growth in these species slowed after sexual maturity, and it would have taken more than three years for Rhamphorhynchus to attain maximum size. In contrast, the more advanced, large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Pteranodon, grew to adult size within the first year of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had <b>determinate</b> growth, meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing.|$|E
5|$|In {{most species}} the sexes are separate, {{but all the}} {{freshwater}} species are hermaphroditic. Nemerteans often have numerous temporary gonads (ovaries or testes), and build temporary gonoducts (ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted), one per gonad, when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, and others protect their eggs in various ways. The fertilized egg divides by spiral cleavage and grows by <b>determinate</b> development, in which {{the fate of a}} cell can usually be predicted from its predecessors in the process of division. The embryos of most taxa develop either directly to form juveniles (like the adult but smaller) or to form planuliform larvae, in which the larva's long axis {{is the same as the}} juvenile's. However, some form a pilidium larva, in which the developing juvenile has a gut which lies across the larva's body, and usually eats the remains of the larva when it emerges. The bodies of some species fragment readily, and even parts near the tail can grow full bodies.|$|E
25|$|Other debates often {{concern the}} scope of {{determined}} systems, with some maintaining that the entire universe is a single <b>determinate</b> system and others identifying other more limited <b>determinate</b> systems (or multiverse). Numerous historical debates involve many philosophical positions and varieties of determinism. They include debates concerning determinism and free will, technically denoted as compatibilistic (allowing the two to coexist) and incompatibilistic (denying their coexistence is a possibility).|$|E

Variability of analyzed genotypes was <b>determinated</b> for further fruit traits: average mass, fruit shape, locules number and dry matter content.

The biggest {{part of the first}} main component has fruit shape and locule number. The second component is <b>determinated</b> by dry matter content, and the third by the fruit mass. For more precisely perception of homology and divergence between analyzed genotypes, nonhierarchical grouping analysis (k-means) was performed, and genotypes were divided into three groups.

25|$|The One {{acts as the}} {{determining}} factor on the Indefinite Dyad, which is called 'the Great and the Small,' and eliminates its indeterminacy, which encompasses every possible relation between largeness and smallness or between excess and deficiency. Thus the One produces <b>determinate</b> relations between magnitudes by making the indeterminacy of the Indefinite Dyad <b>determinate,</b> and just these relations are understood by advocates of the unwritten doctrines to be the Forms of Numbers. This is the origin of <b>determinate</b> Twoness, which can from various perspectives {{be seen as the}} Form of Doubleness or the Form of Halfness. The other Forms of Numbers are derived in the same way out of the two fundamental principles. The structure of space is implicit in the Forms of Numbers: the dimensions of space somehow emerge from their relations. Key details of this extra-temporal emergence of space are missing from the surviving ancient testimonies, and its nature is debated in the scholarly literature.|$|E
