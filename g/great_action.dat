Shaenon K. Garrity, who at some point edited the series for English Shonen Jump, said that, while doing so, her amazement over Oda's craft grew steadily. She states that [...] "he has a natural, playful mastery of the often restrictive weekly-manga format," [...] notes that [...] "interesting things [...] going on deep in the narrative structure," [...] and recommends [...] "sticking through to the later volumes {{to see just how}} crazy and Peter Max-y the art gets". Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine comments that [...] "One Piece is a fun adventure story, with an ensemble cast that is continuing to develop, with <b>great</b> <b>action</b> and character drama." [...] He praised Oda's artwork as [...] "imaginative and creative" [...] and comments that [...] "Oda's imagination just oozes all of the panels [...] ". He also notes that [...] "Oda's panel work [...] features a lot of interesting perspectives and direction, especially during the explosive action sequences which are always a blast," [...] though he complains that the panels can sometimes get [...] "a little chaotic".|$|E

Fear not, though, there are no star deaths [...] only one rather welcome one [...]" [...] John Beresford of TV Scoop praised the entire episode, stating [...] "the pace didn't let up from start to finish, the whole thing looked awesome, the acting was pitch perfect," [...] and the dialogue [...] "never drops into the realms of trite, or hyperbole, or parody. Each phrase is like a diamond. Tight, bright and sparkling. And able to cut deep," [...] adding [...] "this series is already {{shaping up to be}} a classic."

Still, MDK2: Armageddon is a solid shooter with plenty of ingenuity and slick presentation." [...] Nintendo World Report's Jared Rosenberg called the Wii version [...] "a well-designed action platformer that will take {{quite a bit of}} time to get through. Varied play mechanics keep the shooter fresh and the humorous story should occasionally put a smile on your face. It can be challenging and at times frustrating, but overall, it is a fun romp."

2500|$|Not {{until the}} late 18th century did critics and {{performers}} begin to view the play as confusing or inconsistent, with Hamlet falling from such high status. Goethe had one of his characters say, in his 1795 novel Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, [...] "Shakespeare meant...to represent {{the effects of a}} <b>great</b> <b>action</b> laid upon a soul unfit for the performance of it...A lovely, pure, noble, and most moral nature, without the strength of nerve which forms a hero, sinks beneath a burden which it cannot bear, and must not cast away." [...] This change in the view of Hamlet's character is sometimes seen as a shift in the critical emphasis on plot (characteristic of the period before 1750) to an emphasis on the theatrical portrayal of the character (after 1750).|$|E
2500|$|According to Tarantino, {{the most}} {{difficult}} part of making the film was [...] "trying to take myself to a different place as a filmmaker and throw my hat in the ring with other <b>great</b> <b>action</b> directors", as opposed to the dialogue scenes he was known for. The House of Blue Leaves sequence, in which the Bride battles dozens of yakuza soldiers, took eight weeks to film, six weeks over schedule. Tarantino wanted to create [...] "one of the greatest, most exciting sequences in the history of cinema". The crew eschewed computer generated imagery in favor of traditional practical effects used in 1970s Chinese cinema, particularly by director Chang Cheh, including the use of fire extinguishers and condoms to create spurts and explosions of blood. Tarantino told his crew: [...] "Let's pretend we're little kids and we're making a Super 8 movie in our back yard, and you don't have all this shit. How would you achieve this effect? Ingenuity is important here!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph {{gave the}} film a full five stars and praised the film for its acting, screenplay, choreography, stunts, humor, and {{direction}} calling the film a [...] "spiritual sequel" [...] and an [...] "eruption of craziness." [...] Writing for The Guardian and awarding the film four stars out of five, Peter Bradshaw wrote, [...] "Extravagantly deranged, ear-splittingly cacophonous, and entirely over the top, George Miller has revived his Mad Max punk-western franchise as a bizarre convoy chase action-thriller in the post-apocalyptic desert." [...] The New York Times wrote, [...] "Miller has {{reminded us that}} blockbusters {{have the potential to}} not only be art, but radically visionary – even the fourth in a series. What a lovely day, indeed." [...] Scott Mendelson of Forbes gave the film 10 out of 10 stars and wrote, [...] "Mad Max: Fury Road is a remarkable and glorious motion picture, not just one of the <b>great</b> <b>action</b> movies of our time but also a great and timely film, period." [...] Alonso Duralde of TheWrap wrote, [...] "In {{the same way that the}} original 1979 Mad Max was the Citizen Kane of gut-bucket Australian exploitation cinema, Mad Max: Fury Road may well be the Götterdämmerung of drive-in movies. It has its roots in the Western and the post-apocalyptic road-rage action saga , where Miller dares anyone else to follow in his tire treads." [...] IGN reviewer Scott Collura gave the film 9.2 out of 10, saying: [...] "The over-the-top stunts and eccentric characters and designs are all hugely important to Fury Road, ... but it's the overriding sense of the film's uniqueness, its striving to be something more than just another action movie, that is most impressive." ...|$|E
