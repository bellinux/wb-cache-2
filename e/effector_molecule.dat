[...] Thus, a mRNA that contains a riboswitch is directly involved in regulating its own activity, {{in response to the}} concentrations of its <b>effector</b> <b>molecule.</b> The discovery that modern organisms use RNA to bind small molecules, and discriminate against closely related analogs, expanded the known natural capabilities of RNA beyond its ability to code for proteins, catalyze reactions, or to bind other RNA or protein macromolecules.|$|E

40|$|Organisms which rely {{solely on}} innate defense systems must combat {{a large number of}} antagonists with a {{comparatively}} low number of defense <b>effector</b> <b>molecules.</b> As one solution of this problem, these organisms have evolved <b>effector</b> <b>molecules</b> targeting epitopes that are conserved between different antagonists of a specific taxon or, if possible, even of different taxa. In order to restrict the activity of the defense <b>effector</b> <b>molecules</b> to physiologically relevant taxa, these target epitopes should, on the other hand, be taxon-specific and easily accessible. Glycans fulfill all these requirements and are therefore a preferred target of defense <b>effector</b> <b>molecules,</b> in particular defense proteins.

40|$|Nitrophenyl (NP) -specific {{helper cells}} and {{suppressor}} cells were induced in vitro using NP-T 4 bacteriophage as antigen. These cells could mediate their effects also by secreted <b>effector</b> <b>molecules,</b> helper and suppressor factors. The function of both NP-specific helper and suppressor cells was abolished by treatment with anti-Thy 1. 2 plus C', {{but they were}} not retained on nylon wool columns, suggesting that NP-specific helpers and suppressors were T cells.

40|$|A binary {{complex of}} the ammonia channel Amt 1 from Methanococcus jannaschii and its cognate PII {{signalling}} protein GlnK 1 has been produced and characterized. Complex formation is prevented specifically by the <b>effector</b> <b>molecules</b> Mg-ATP and 2 -ketoglutarate. Single-particle electron microscopy {{of the complex}} shows that GlnK 1 binds on the cytoplasmic side of Amt 1. Three high-resolution X-ray structures of GlnK 1 indicate that the functionally important T-loop has an extended, flexible conformation {{in the absence of}} Mg-ATP, but assumes a compact, tightly folded conformation upon Mg-ATP binding, which in turn creates a 2 -ketoglutarate-binding site. We propose a regulatory mechanism by which nitrogen uptake is controlled by the binding of both <b>effector</b> <b>molecules</b> to GlnK 1. At normal effector levels, a 2 -ketoglutarate molecule binding at the apex of the compact T-loop would prevent complex formation, ensuring uninhibited ammonia uptake. At low levels of Mg-ATP, the extended loops would seal the ammonia channels in the complex. Binding of both <b>effector</b> <b>molecules</b> to PII signalling proteins may thus represent an effective feedback mechanism for regulating ammonium uptake through the membrane...|$|R

40|$|PhDIn a pretargeting {{radioimmunotherapy}} system, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) derivatised {{with a high}} affinity streptavidin receptor {{are used}} in a localisation step. Once tumour localisation has taken place and active or passive MAb clearance has been completed the final step is the administration of a radiotoxic radiopharmaceutical, which is a ligand to a high affinity receptor on the MAb. This technique maximises the tumour to background ratio and facilitates the use of much higher tumour radiation doses. Four pretargeting <b>effector</b> <b>molecules</b> were developed {{with a view to}} selecting the best performer for further pretargeting assays. When analysed for key characteristics, two of the novel [...] DOTA-biotin conjugated <b>effector</b> <b>molecules</b> were selecxed for advanced testing in a pretargeting context.

Mouse biodistribution studies of indium- 111 and yttrium- 90 labelled <b>effector</b> <b>molecules</b> showed minimal organ retention and very rapid clearance.

The Herceptin-streptavidin system was evaluated for cell binding potential with human breast cancer cells.

40|$|Fungal infections of {{the lung}} are {{life-threatening}} but rarely occur in healthy, immunocompetent individuals, indicating efficient clearance by pulmonary defense mechanisms.

The last decade has witnessed the completion of a large number of Lactobacillus genome sequences, including the genome sequences of some of the probiotic species and strains.
