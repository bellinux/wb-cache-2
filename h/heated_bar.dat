25|$|Roll forging is {{a process}} where round or flat bar stock is reduced in {{thickness}} and increased in length. Roll forging is performed using two cylindrical or semi-cylindrical rolls, each containing one or more shaped grooves. A <b>heated</b> <b>bar</b> is inserted into the rolls and when it hits a spot the rolls rotate and the bar is progressively shaped as it is rolled through the machine. The piece is then transferred to {{the next set of}} grooves or turned around and reinserted into the same grooves. This continues until the desired shape and size is achieved. The advantage of this process is there is no flash and it imparts a favorable grain structure into the workpiece.|$|E

40|$|A new {{systematic}} {{approach to the}} construction of approximate solutions to a class of nonlinear singularly perturbed feedback control systems using the boundary layer functions especially with regard to the possible occurrence of the boundary layers is proposed. For example, problems with feedback control, such as the steady-states of the thermostats, where the controllers add or remove heat, depending upon the temperature registered in another place of the <b>heated</b> <b>bar,</b> can be interpreted with a second-order ordinary differential equation subject to a nonlocal three [...] point boundary condition. The O(ϵ) accurate approximation of behavior of these nonlinear systems in terms of the exponentially small boundary layer functions is given.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the high {{standard}} of the machines, the heat contact sealing technique for the sealing of pouches in packaging machines still offers possibilities for optimization, even when alternative sealing techniques are considered. Each sealing jaw has a typical temperature profile on its working surface which is determined by its construction, {{the position of the}} <b>heating</b> <b>bars</b> and temperature sensors, the number of <b>heating</b> <b>bars</b> as well as their heat conductivity. The profile changes qualitatively little when packaging materials of different production conditions. Quantitatively the length of the pouches affects the difference in temperature along the sealing zone. Tests showed temperature variations along the sealing area of 50 % and more. This is also seen in the strength distribution along the seams of the pouches which showed poor seal-strength and leakage at the critical locations. Variations because of controlling the actual sealing temperature and variations because of heat exch ange during machine motion have little effect on the seal quality. For length sealing tools a compromise has to be found between the length of the number of the regulated <b>heating</b> <b>bars</b> and temperature sensors...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that the heat {{treatment}} causes changes in electromagnetic and in mechanical properties of the material. It is assumed that a sudden drop in micro-hardness in a partly annealed ferromagnetic bar is reflected also as a sudden change in relative permeability. This could be detected by the electromagnetic methods. � The basic idea is simple: the bar should be put into a coil and the impedance {{as a function of}} frequency should be measured. From the frequency dependence of impedance it could be tested how the relative permeability is changing across the cross-section. The experimental bars were prepared at the Faculty for Mechanical Engineering of University of Ljubljana. The ferromagnetic bars were annealed in a high frequency inductor. However the measured values of micro-hardness in the cross-section were rather widely spread and did not show any well defined abrupt radial change. Since the heat is generated by eddy currents the relative permeability in the <b>heated</b> <b>bar</b> is changing when the temperature grows above the Curie temperature.

40|$|In this {{overview}} the mechanical, thermal {{and electrical}} properties of CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) diamond, determined by various non-destructive techniques, are highlighted and compared with calculations. In {{the case of}} Young's modulus the measurement results of high quality samples leads to an average value of 1126 GPa which is in good agreement with the calculated value of 1143 GPa {{and close to the}} Young's modulus of single crystalline diamond. However, values as low as 242 GPa were determined on 300 µm thick bulk CVD diamond. The differences in the measurement results {{can be traced back to}} extended voids in the sample. A traditional <b>heated</b> <b>bar</b> technique was used to measure the temperature dependent thermal conductivity of CVD-diamond. High quality polycrystalline diamond films reached a room temperature thermal conductivity of 20. 5 W cm- 1 K- 1. This value is comparable to the thermal conductivity of the best single crystal diamonds available. For the lower quality samples, boundary scattering and point defects are most likely responsible for the lower thermal conductivity. The electrical properties of B-doped polycrystalline diamond films were characterized by temperature dependent Hall and conductivity measurements. These measurements together with a semi-empirical model give insight in to the current transport mechanism. The model indicates, that the electrical mobility in diamond thin films it lower compared with single crystal diamond.

40|$|In recent {{time there}} is a very great {{interest}} in the study of differential equations of fractional order, in which the unknown function is under the symbol of fractional derivative. It is due {{to the development of the}} theory of fractional integro-differential theory and application of it in different fields. The fractional integrals and derivatives of fractional integro-differential equations are widely used in modern investigations of theoretical physics, mechanics, and applied mathematics. The fractional calculus is a very powerful tool for describing physical systems, which have a memory and are non-local. Many processes in complex systems have nonlocality and long-time memory. Fractional integral operators and fractional differential operators allow describing some of these properties. The use of the fractional calculus will be helpful for obtaining the dynamical models, in which integro-differential operators describe power long-time memory by time and coordinates, and three-dimensional nonlocality for complex medium and processes. Differential equations of fractional order appear when we use fractal conception in physics of the condensed medium. The transfer, described by the operator with fractional derivatives at a long distance from the sources, leads to other behavior of relatively small concentrations as compared with classic diffusion. This fact redefines the existing ideas about safety, based on the ideas on exponential velocity of damping. Fractional calculus in the fractal theory and the systems with memory have the same importance as the classic analysis in mechanics of continuous medium. In recent years, the application of fractional derivatives for describing and studying the physical processes of stochastic transfer is very popular too. Many problems of filtration of liquids in fractal (high porous) medium lead to the need to study boundary value problems for partial differential equations in fractional order. In this paper the authors first considered the boundary value problem for stationary equation for mass transfer in super-diffusion conditions and abnormal advection. Then the solution of the problem is explicitly given. The solution is obtained by the Fourier’s method. The obtained results will be useful in liquid filtration theory in fractal medium and for modeling the temperature variations in the <b>heated</b> <b>bar...</b>|$|E

30|$|In recent years, the {{existence}} of solutions of boundary value problems have been studied by many authors [1 – 4]. Chew and Flordeliza, in [5], generalized the classical Carathéodory’s existence theorem on the Cauchy problem x^'=f(t, x) with x(0)= 0. Particularly, in [6, 7], the differential equations involving the approximate derivatives are considered. BVP (1.1)-(1.2), which has been studied in [4] by using ordinary derivatives, came from the steady-state of a <b>heat</b> <b>bar</b> model.

Without loss of generality, we use the distributional derivatives to discuss (1.1)-(1.2) in a general form. The existence result obtained under weaker conditions extends the previous results in the literatures.|$|R

40|$|To {{provide a}} better {{understanding}} of how frazil ice deposits on trash racks at water intakes, the phenomenon was video recorded at two hydropower plants and in a refrigerated laboratory flume. Initial accretion of frazil ice around a single bar and the motion of particles in the vicinity of an obstacle was simulated through numerical modelling and studied using plastic particles in a laboratory flume. Ice initially accumulates on the upstream face of the bars, and it progresses then to the upstream sides of the bars. Tha frazil ice layer grows in all directions, and it finally bridges over the spaces between bars. The ice blockage starts at the upper part of the rack and progresses downward. The head losses across each intake, which are observed continuously at the plants, illustrate the degree and importance of ice growth. Observations from laboratory experiments with a single bar in a flume, showed that frazil ice particles deposited on all bar surfaces. Separate flume tests were run with plastic particles simulating ice particles. The frequency of collision of these particles with the front face of a rectangular bar varied with the particle density and the fluid velocity. In a test with particles of various sizes, the smaller particles were more likely to enter the side wake than larger ones. A mathematical model can be used to predict patterns of ice deposition that correspond to the observed results. Such a model must include a hydrodynamic part for viscous flows and a particle trajectory model. Some models neglect the term for force due to pressure gradient in their calculations of a particle trajectory because the particles had larger density than the surrounding fluid. Ice particles have almost the same density as the water and simulated results showed that this term, caused by the pressure gradient, is the dominant force that counter the momentum of the particles when they move in the region close to the obstacle. The simulated results were affected by the particle size distribution, therefore the size distribution of frazil ice particles in a river is a factor in further studies. In tests in which no particles were allowed to deposit on the front part of the bar, in a simulation of a <b>heated</b> <b>bar,</b> lesser amounts deposited on the other parts of the bar. Knowledge of the way frazil ice accumulates on water intakes and the initial ice accretion on individual trash racks should be valuable in future work for finding methods to reduce the ice blockage and in the verification of more detailed model studies.
