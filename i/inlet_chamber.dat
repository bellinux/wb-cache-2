We tested the hypothesis that <b>inlet</b> <b>chamber</b> temperature, influenced by ambient air and ventilator output temperatures, may affect humidifier performance, as assessed by hygrometry. Hygrometry was measured with three different humidifiers under several conditions, varying ambient air temperatures (high, 28 - 30 degrees C; and normal, 22 - 24 degrees C), ventilators with different gas temperatures, and two VE levels. Clinical measurements were performed to confirm bench measurements. Humidifier performance was strongly correlated with <b>inlet</b> <b>chamber</b> temperature in both the bench (p < 0. 0001, r 2 = 0. 93) and the clinical study. With unfavorable conditions, absolute humidity of inspired gas was much lower than recommended (approximately 20 mg H 2 O/L). Performance was improved by specific settings or new compensatory algorithms. Hygrometry could be evaluated from condensation on the wall chamber only when ambient air temperature was normal but not with high air temperature. An increase in <b>inlet</b> <b>chamber</b> temperature induced by high ambient temperature markedly reduces the performance of heated-wire humidifiers, leading to a risk of endotracheal tube occlusion.

The need to design smaller and more powerful machines rotating at higher speeds {{in order to provide}} increasing efficiencies, has to face a major limitation: cavitation. A two-dimensional numerical approach, by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), has been developed for studying the effect of cavitation in the volumetric efficiency of external gear pumps. Several cavitation models and grid deformation algorithms have been studied, and a method for simulating the contact between solid boundaries has been developed. The velocity field in the <b>inlet</b> <b>chamber</b> has also been experimentally measured by means of Time-Resolved Particle Image Velocimetry (TRPIV) and results have been compared to the numerical ones in order to validate the accuracy of the model.

As the object of simulation was selected the underground pumping station with a diameter of 26 m and a depth of 13 m, divided into two independent branches, equipped with 8 submersible pumps.

As an industrial natural-gas burner, the device offers advantages over simple nozzles of equivalent capacity. However, its usefulness as a pulverised solid-fuel burner is constrained because it requires a high supply pressure. This {{is due to the}} high energy-loss coefcient of the inlet expansion ratio, D/d 1. If an equilateral-triangular inlet replaces the circular inlet, oscillating ow occurs at equivalent expansion ratios as low as D/d 1 ¼ 2, and the supply pressure is much lower. An engineering model of the loss coefcient is obtained from measurements of supply pressure over a wide range of nozzle geometries. To begin, we split the overall loss coefcient K into three components, one for each of the <b>inlet</b> orice, <b>chamber</b> and exit lip. A formula representing each component of K is then determined from dimensional analysis, inspection of the data, and least-squares curve tting.

Based on these changing parameters, the solar dryer was designed to suit the conditions. The main parts of the dryer are; hinged flexible angled solar collector, drying chamber consisting of three drying trays, updraft chimney with metallic absorber plate. The experiments were carried out to dry sliced apples of 2. 5 mm thickness spread over the drying trays. Temperature and relative humidity of airflow were taken at the collector <b>inlet,</b> drying <b>chamber</b> <b>inlet</b> and drying <b>chamber</b> outlet to chimney using data loggers. Airflow inlet to solar collector and from drying chamber was determined using hot wire anemometers, irradiation in W/m 2 was measured by radiation meter. Drying characteristics such as the collected solar energy to evaporated moisture, average drying rate, moisture content, etc., were determined. Natural convectional flow was adopted with an advantage of utilizing updraft air chimney to induce thermo-siphoning effect hence improving efficiency. In our current study, fresh apples of 886. 64 grams with moisture content of 86 % were dried to moisture content of 8. 12 % (wet basis) within 9 hours 20 minutes at an average irradiance of 534. 45 W/m 2.

The saturated hydraulic conductivity (HCsat) of the sand was monitored over time. Among the four bacterial strains tested, one formed a capsule, one produced slime layers, and two did not produce any detectable exopolymers. The last two strains were nonmucoid variants of the first two. Only one strain, the slime producer, had a large impact on the HCsat. The production of exopolymers had no effect on either cell multiplication within or movement through the sand columns. Therefore, the HCsat reduction observed with the slime producer was tentatively attributed to the obstruction of flow channels with slime. Compared with the results with Arthrobacter sp. strain AK 19 used in a previous study, there was a 100 -fold increase in detachment from the solid substratum and movement through the sand of the strains used in this study.

First, the Particle Image Velocimetry method was {{used to analyze the}} two-dimensional velocity field in the middle plane of the suction chamber of the gear pump. The main improvement, with respect to previous similar analysis is the use of alginate micro particles as tracers. It is seen that the two-dimensional model is able to characterize the flow field of the real pump in the region of the <b>inlet</b> <b>chamber</b> in which cavitation is expected.

The effects of {{factors such as}} AOD dose, initial P concentration of the feeding solution, and aging on the P removal ability of the slags were analyzed. In a column experiment, electric arc furnace slag (EAF), blast furnace slag (BFS) and AOD were combined in five different ways to determine optimal conditions for P removal. In another column experiment, {{the three types of}} slag were modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and NaOH to adjust their dissolution properties and the effect on P removal performance was examined. In the batch experiments, AOD exhibited very promising P removal ability. It removed 94. 8 % of P from 6. 5 mg P L- 1 synthetic solution in 4 hours with a dose of 5 g L- 1. Maximum P removal capacity of 27. 5 mg P g- 1 was achieved. In the dual-filter column experiment, the column packed with only EAF had the best P removal performance (consistently above 93 %). Amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) was identified as the main P species in the five slag samples collected from the outlet chambers. The contributions from crystalline calcium phosphate (Ca-P) and P adsorbed on iron/aluminum (hydr) oxides were greater in samples from the <b>inlet</b> <b>chambers.</b> The P speciation results revealed that P was predominantly removed by the slags through formation of ACP. The second column experiment showed that modification with PEG and NaOH solution only enhanced short-term P removal by the slags. However, exhaustion of the modified slags occurred much earlier, indicating that the modification process had shortened the lifespan of the slags. Untreated AOD showed better P removal than untreated EAF until pore volume 244, probably due to faster dissolution rate of gamma dicalcium silicate (dominating in AOD according to the XRD results) than of beta dicalcium silicate (dominating in EAF).
