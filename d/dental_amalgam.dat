5|$|The Chinese of the Tang era {{were also}} very {{interested}} in the benefits of officially classifying all of the medicines used in pharmacology. In 657, Emperor Gaozong of Tang (r. 649–683) commissioned the literary project of publishing an official materia medica, complete with text and illustrated drawings for 833 different medicinal substances taken from different stones, minerals, metals, plants, herbs, animals, vegetables, fruits, and cereal crops. In addition to compiling pharmacopeias, the Tang fostered learning in medicine by upholding imperial medical colleges, state examinations for doctors, and publishing forensic manuals for physicians. Authors of medicine in the Tang include Zhen Chuan (d. 643) and Sun Simiao (581–682), the former who first identified in writing that patients with diabetes had an excess of sugar in their urine, and the latter who was the first to recognize that diabetic patients should avoid consuming alcohol and starchy foods.

40|$|Introduction: In Vermont, {{cremation}} {{has increasingly}} become {{an alternative to}} interment of an intact body.

They are an economical option for caries repair, and remain popular. Roughly one third of all caries fillings done in 2002 in the U. S. utilized amalgam. Amalgam is a metal alloy containing as much as 50 % mercury by volume, a metal that is a known toxicant. <b>Dental</b> <b>amalgams,</b> may constitute a source of low level, continual exposure for those with these dental devices in situ and may be released to the atmosphere upon cremation.

40|$|<b>Dental</b> <b>amalgams</b> {{have been}} the most {{commonly}} used restorative material in dentistry. A typical amalgam consists of approximately 50 % mercury by weight. The mercury in the amalgam is continuously released over time as elemental mercury vapor (Begerow et al., 1994). Research indicates that this pathway contributes to the total mercury body burden, with mercury levels in some body fluids correlating with the amount and surface area of fillings for non-occupationally exposed individuals (Langworth et al., 1991; Olstad et al., 1987; Snapp et al., 1989). For the average individual an intake of 2 - 20 µg/day of elemental mercury vapor is estimated from this pathway (Begerow et al., 1994). Additionally, during and immediately following removal or installation of <b>dental</b> <b>amalgams</b> supplementary exposures of 1 - 5 µg/day for several days can be expected (Geurtsen 1990). Approximately 80 % of the elemental mercury vapor released by <b>dental</b> <b>amalgams</b> is expected to be re-absorbed by the lungs (Begerow et al., 1994). In contrast, dietary inorganic mercury absorption via the gastrointestinal tract is known the be about 7 %. The contribution to the body burden of inorganic mercury is thus, greater from <b>dental</b> <b>amalgams</b> than from the diet or any other source.

25|$|This {{discussion}} of the <b>dental</b> <b>amalgam</b> controversy outlines {{the debate over whether}} <b>dental</b> <b>amalgam</b> (the silver alloy in dental fillings) should be used.

25|$|A 2006 Zogby International poll of 2,590 US adults {{found that}} 72% of {{respondents}} {{were not aware}} that mercury was a main component of <b>dental</b> <b>amalgam</b> and 92% of respondents would prefer to be told about mercury in <b>dental</b> <b>amalgam</b> before receiving it as a filling.

25|$|Environmental {{concerns}} over external costs exist as well. In the United States, <b>dental</b> <b>amalgam</b> {{is the largest}} source of mercury received by sewage treatment plants. The mercury contaminates the treatment plant sludge, which is typically disposed of by land application, landfilling or incineration.

40|$|All {{types of}} <b>dental</b> <b>{{amalgams}}</b> contain mercury, which partly is emitted as mercury vapor. All types of <b>dental</b> <b>amalgams</b> corrode after {{being placed in}} the oral cavity. Modern high copper amalgams exhibit two new traits of increased instability. Firstly, when subjected to wear/polishing, droplets rich in mercury are formed on the surface, showing that mercury is not being strongly bonded to the base or alloy metals. Secondly, high copper amalgams emit substantially larger amounts of mercury vapor than the low copper amalgams used before the 1970 s. High copper amalgams has been developed with focus on mechanical strength and corrosion resistance, but has been sub-optimized in other aspects, resulting in increased instability and higher emission of mercury vapor. This has not been presented to policy makers and scientists. Both low and high copper amalgams undergo a transformation process for several years after placement, resulting in a substantial reduction in mercury content, but there exist no limit for maximum allowed emission of mercury from <b>dental</b> <b>amalgams.</b> These modern high copper amalgams are nowadays totally dominating the European, US and other markets, resulting in significant emissions of mercury, not considered when judging their suitability for dental restoration...|$|R

25|$|During the 1980s and 1990s in Norway, {{there was}} {{considerable}} and intense public debate {{on the use of}} <b>dental</b> <b>amalgam.</b> The Norwegian Dental Patients Association (Forbundet Tenner og Helse), made up of people who believe they suffered health effects from amalgam fillings, was a driving force in this debate. During this time, the media often featured interviews with people claiming that their health problems were caused by amalgam fillings, and who have regained their health after replacing their amalgam fillings with a different material. Some scientific studies also reported that patients have been restored to health after having had their amalgam fillings replaced. However, these studies were heavily disputed at the time and the Norwegian Board of Health still maintain there is no scientifically proven connection between <b>dental</b> <b>amalgam</b> and health problems.|$|E

Given its superior strength, durability, and long life relative to the more expensive composite fillings, it will likely be used for many years to come.

For example, due to pollution of the world's oceans with heavy metals, products such as cod liver oil may contain significant levels of mercury.|$|E

25|$|Most {{of these}} materials, with the notable {{exception}} of gold, have not been used as long as amalgam, and some are known to contain other potentially hazardous compounds.

40|$|<b>Dental</b> <b>amalgams</b> {{have been}} used for centuries as major {{restorative}} materials for decaying teeth. Amalgams are prepared by mixing alloy particles which contain Ag, Sn, and Cu as the major constituent elements with liquid Hg. The study of microstructure is essential in understanding the setting reactions and improving the properties of amalgams. Until the work reported in this dissertation, optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and x-ray diffractometry (XRD) were used commonly to analyze amalgam microstructures. No previous systematic transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study has been performed due to sample preparation difficulties and composite structure of <b>dental</b> <b>amalgams.</b> The goal of this research was to carry out detailed microstructural and compositional studies of <b>dental</b> <b>amalgams.</b> This was accomplished using the enhanced spatial resolution of the TEM and its associated microanalytical techniques, namely, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), x-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) and micro-microdiffraction (μμD). A new method was developed for thinning amalgam samples to electron transparency using the "wedge technique. " Velvalloy, a low-Cu amalgam, and Tytin, a high-Cu amalgam, were the two amalgams characterized. Velvalloy is composed of a Ag₂Hg₃ (γ₁) /HgSn₇₋₉ (γ₂) matrix surrounding unreacted Ag₃Sn (γ) particles. In addition, hitherto uncharacterized reaction layers between Ag₃Sn(γ) /Ag₂Hg₃ (γ₂) and Ag₂Hg₃ (γ₁) /HgSn₇₋₉ (γ₂) were observed and analyzed. An Ag-Hg-Sn (β₁) phase was clearly identified for the first time. In Tytin, the matrix consists of Ag₂Hg₃ (γ₁) grains. Fine precipitates of Cu₆Sn₅ (η') are embedded inside the γ₁ and at the grain boundaries. These precipitates are responsible for the improved creep resistance of Tytin compared to Velvalloy. The additional Cu has completely eliminated the γ₂ phase which is the weakest component of amalgams. Ag-Hg-Sn (β₁) and large grains of Cu₆Sn₅ (η') are found adjacent to the unreacted alloy particles. Tytin alloy particles contain Cu₃Sn (ε) precipitates in a matrix of Ag₃Sn (γ) and Ag₄Sn (β). SEM was used to correlate the TEM findings {{in the context of the}} general microstructure. The results are in good agreement with those published in the literature. The microstructural details reported here, many of which were not previously available, will help provide insight into the deformation mechanisms of <b>dental</b> <b>amalgams...</b>|$|R
