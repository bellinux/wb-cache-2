50|$|Production of <b>domestic</b> <b>refrigerators</b> lagged in the Soviet Union {{compared}} {{to some other}} countries. The first Soviet <b>domestic</b> <b>refrigerators</b> were produced at the Kharkov Tractor Factory in 1937, but World War II soon caused production to be halted. This, and the subsequent devastation of Soviet industry, delayed the mass production of refrigerators until the 1960s, while iceboxes continued in common use.|$|R

50|$|A <b>domestic</b> <b>refrigerator</b> is {{an example}} of a heat pump: a heat engine in reverse. Work is used to create a heat differential. Many cycles can run in reverse to move heat from the cold side to the hot side, making the cold side cooler and the hot side hotter. Internal {{combustion}} engine versions of these cycles are, by their nature, not reversible.|$|E
50|$|With {{the passage}} of time, breads harden and become stale. This is not {{primarily}} due to moisture being lost from the baked products, but more a reorganization {{of the way in}} which the water and starch are associated over time.

40|$|Temperature {{control of}} food in the home is vitally important. In the past decade there have been 15 {{published}} surveys of temperatures in <b>domestic</b> <b>refrigerators.</b> The last detailed survey {{carried out in the}} UK was in 1991. Refrigerators are now fitted with lower power compressors and thicker insulation to enable them to achieve low energy consumption. Therefore {{there is a possibility that}} due to these changes, temperatures in <b>domestic</b> <b>refrigerators</b> have changed. This paper reports results from a survey of currently used <b>domestic</b> <b>refrigerators</b> and compares the results to those obtained in 1991. In addition the paper examines temperatures in domestic freezers. Although freezers pose less of a food safety risk they do contribute to poor food quality and potential waste if the food is not maintained at low enough conditions. None of the surveys published to date examines temperatures in domestic freezers...|$|R
50|$|Domestic {{refrigerators}} and freezers {{for food}} storage {{are made in}} a range of sizes. Among the smallest is a 4 L Peltier refrigerator advertised as being able to hold 6 cans of beer.

A refrigerator without a frozen food storage compartment may have a small section just to make ice cubes. Freezers may have drawers to store food in, or they may have no divisions (chest freezers).|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{probability}} of contamination of <b>domestic</b> <b>refrigerators</b> {{seems to be}} greater for Salmonella, than other, distinctly psychrotolerant bacteria. This survey investigated Salmonella spp. contamination of <b>domestic</b> <b>refrigerators</b> in households (n = 100). The presence of Salmonella species was found in 13. 95 % of households that kept eggs in designated egg storage in refrigerators (n = 86). We identified 12 serotypes of Salmonella spp. with antimicrobial resistance, of which 50 % were identified as S. Typhimurium. The results obtained confirm the need to strongly advise consumers how to properly arrange different foodstuffs inside household refrigerators...|$|R

5000|$|Export bananas {{are picked}} green, and ripen in special rooms upon {{arrival in the}} {{destination}} country. These rooms are air-tight and filled with ethylene gas to induce ripening. The vivid yellow color consumers normally associate with supermarket bananas is, in fact, caused by the artificial ripening process. Flavor and texture are also affected by ripening temperature. Bananas are refrigerated to between 13.5 and 15 C during transport. At lower temperatures, ripening permanently stalls, and the bananas turn gray as cell walls break down. The skin of ripe bananas quickly blackens in the 4 C environment of a <b>domestic</b> <b>refrigerator,</b> although the fruit inside remains unaffected."Tree-ripened" [...] Cavendish bananas have a greenish-yellow appearance which changes to a brownish-yellow as they ripen further. Although both flavor and texture of tree-ripened bananas is generally regarded as superior to any type of green-picked fruit, this reduces shelf life to only 7-10 days.|$|E
50|$|Mpemba and Osborne {{describe}} placing 70 ml {{samples of}} water in 100 ml beakers in the ice box of a <b>domestic</b> <b>refrigerator</b> {{on a sheet of}} polystyrene foam. They showed the time for freezing to start was longest with an initial temperature of 25 C and that it was much less at around 90 C. They ruled out loss of liquid volume by evaporation as a significant factor and the effect of dissolved air. In their setup most heat loss was found to be from the liquid surface. David Auerbach describes an effect that he observed in samples in glass beakers placed into a liquid cooling bath. In all cases the water supercooled, reaching a temperature of typically -6 to -18 C before spontaneously freezing. Considerable random variation was observed in the time required for spontaneous freezing to start and in some cases this resulted in the water which started off hotter (partially) freezing first.|$|E

The performance of the refrigerator using hydrocarbons as refrigerants was investigated and compared with the performance of refrigerator when R- 134 a was used as refrigerant. The effect of condenser temperature and evaporator temperature on COP, refrigerating effect, condenser duty, work of compression and heat rejection ratio were investigated.
