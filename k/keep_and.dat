5|$|The keep {{appears to}} lie on the highest ground in the area, {{although}} this is actually located to the south, within in the deer park. Visitors would have been funnelled {{around the edge of}} the park and by the town wall towards the south gate of the castle, a route dominated by the views of the <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> tower. The addition of the high tower had made the castle visible to anyone entering from Devon, framing it strikingly against the hills. The keep, park and town walls probably symbolised Richard's authority as earl, and the historian Andrew Saunders has argued that the <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> high tower were also intended to resemble Richard of Cornwall's crown in his role as the King of the Romans.|$|E

Muhammad and Imams' words and deeds are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin (known as ismah, or infallibility) and must be chosen by divine decree, or nass, through the Prophet.|$|E

5|$|Anderitum {{fell into}} ruin {{following}} {{the end of}} the Roman occupation but was reoccupied in 1066 by the Normans, for whom it became a key strategic bulwark. A stone <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> fortification was built within the Roman walls and faced several sieges. Although its garrison was twice starved into surrender, it was never successfully stormed. The castle was occupied more or less continuously until the 16th century, apart from a possible break in the early 13th century when it was slighted. It had been abandoned again by the late 16th century and remained a crumbling, partly overgrown ruin until it was acquired by the state in 1925.|$|E
5|$|Cowes Castle, {{also known}} as West Cowes Castle, is a Device Fort in Cowes on the Isle of Wight. Originally built by Henry VIII in 1539 to protect England against the threat of {{invasion}} from France and the Holy Roman Empire, it comprised a circular bastion, flanking wings and a <b>keep,</b> <b>and</b> in 1547 it housed 17 pieces of artillery. With its companion fortification at East Cowes, the castle overlooked {{the entrance to the}} River Medina, an important anchorage. The invasion threat passed but the fortification continued in use until the middle of the 19th century, very briefly seeing action in 1642 during the English Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Goodrich Castle was {{probably}} built by Godric of Mappestone after the Norman invasion of England, initially as an earth and wooden fortification. In {{the middle of}} the 12th century the original castle was replaced with a stone <b>keep,</b> <b>and</b> was then expanded significantly during the late 13th century into a concentric structure combining luxurious living quarters with extensive defences. The success of Goodrich's design influenced many other constructions across England over the following years. It became the seat of the powerful Talbot family before falling out of favour as a residence in late Tudor times.|$|E

5|$|St Andrew's Castle was an {{artillery}} fort constructed by Henry VIII near Hamble-le-Rice, Hampshire, between 1542 and 1543. It formed {{part of the}} King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended Southampton Water near the Solent. St Andrew's comprised a <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> a gun platform, protected by a moat. The castle was decommissioned in 1642 during the English Civil War and has been largely destroyed through coastal erosion.|$|E
5|$|The Second Amendment {{protects the}} {{individual}} right to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> bear arms. The concept {{of such a}} right existed within English common law long before {{the enactment of the}} Bill of Rights. First codified in the English Bill of Rights of 1689 (but there only applying to Protestants), this right was enshrined in fundamental laws of several American states during the Revolutionary era, including the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. Long a controversial issue in American political, legal, and social discourse, the Second Amendment has been at the heart of several Supreme Court decisions.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{subsequently}} given by Henry II to Thomas Becket {{when he became}} chancellor in 1155. Becket extended the castle to accommodate his large household, but fell from favour in 1164 and the castle was confiscated by the king. Henry II liked Berkhamsted and subsequently used it himself extensively. By the mid-12th century, the castle had been rebuilt in stone, probably by Becket, with a shell <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> an outer stone wall; the bailey was divided in two by a wall to form an inner and an outer bailey. A gatehouse led down into the town, meeting with Castle Street. Henry II also officially recognised the surrounding settlement of Berkhamsted as a town in 1156.|$|E

5|$|The {{design was}} rather {{different}} to von Haschenperg's first castle. The <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> the stirrup towers {{were raised in}} height, {{the level of the}} floors elevated, the curtain wall was strengthened, the old bastions entirely removed and four new, larger bastions added in their place, while the older foreworks around the castle were demolished. The keep's flat roof was altered to a pitched design, and the guns that it had supported moved into the outlying bastions. Although the size of the castle had slightly decreased, the new design had much more domestic space available for the garrison.|$|E
5|$|The gun {{law in the}} Czech Republic {{is quite}} liberal. It is mostly caused {{by the fact that}} after the fall of {{communist}} regime people wanted to regain their rights to <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> bear arms and these needs resulted in passing quite liberal legislation in 1995, which surpassed the previous restrictive communist enactment. The law became widely accepted and led to quite massive civilian arming. Especially many businessmen felt the actual need to obtain a firearm because the times shortly after the Velvet Revolution are known for the rise in organized crime often related to the economic transformation in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{north-east}} and north-west towers, {{now only}} one-storey tall, {{were covered with}} turf, turning {{the rear of the}} outer ward into a flat, grassed esplanade. The southern tower was reduced in height to two storeys, but remained in use as a gun platform. The covered corridors between the <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> the towers were now one-storey high as well, linking to the buried towers in the north-east and north-west bastions. The upper storeys of the gatehouse were rebuilt, although the ground floor remained in its 16th-century condition.|$|E
