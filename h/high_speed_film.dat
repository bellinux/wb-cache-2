40|$|Melt {{ejection}} is {{the dominant}} material removal mechanism in long, ms, pulse laser drilling of metals, a process with applications such as the drilling of cooling holes in turbine blades. Droplets of molten material are ejected through the entrance hole and, after breakthrough, through the exit hole. <b>High</b> <b>speed</b> <b>filming</b> is used to study the ejected material {{in order to better}} understand how this debris may interact with material in the immediate vicinity of the drilled hole. Existing studies have quantified various aspects of melt ejection, however they usually focus on ejection through the entrance hole. This work concentrates on rear melt ejection and is relevant to issues such as rear wall impingement. A 2 kW IPG 200 S fibre laser is used to drill mild steel. <b>High</b> <b>speed</b> <b>filming</b> is combined with image analysis to characterise the rearward-ejected material. Particle size and velocity data is presented as a function of drilling parameters. It is concluded that <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>filming</b> combined with image analysis and proper consideration of process limitations and optimisation strategies can be a powerful tool in understanding resultant debris distributions...|$|R

50|$|An {{animated}} film trilogy was announced by Kyoto Animation. The first two, titled Free! -Timeless Medley- Kizuna and Free! -Timeless Medley- Yakusoku are compilations of both seasons of the anime series, with new scenes added. Kizuna {{focuses on the}} five main members of the Iwatobi Swim Club, while Yakusoku focuses on Rin and Sousuke from the Samezuka Swim Club. Both films opened on April 22 and July 1, 2017, respectively. A third film, titled Free! -Take Your Marks-, is a new story {{taking place in the}} spring as Haruka deals with high school graduation and everyone's futures as they move forward in their lives and will be released on October 28, 2017. The first two films were directed by Eisaku Kawanami, and much of the staff from the anime series and <b>High</b> <b>Speed!</b> <b>film</b> returned for the compilation films, including series composer Masahiro Yokotani, character designer Futoshi Nishiya and composer Tatsuya Katō.|$|E
5000|$|To take pictures, {{the film}} must be fully {{loaded into the}} camera (100%). The player can move at three speeds, the normal speed, the focused speed, and a super-focused speed which also allows for <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>film</b> loading. When taking pictures, the player can hold the shoot button to control the {{viewfinder}} while the picture frame shrinks — this {{can be used to}} zoom in on the boss. During this time, all bullets on screen are slowed down and Aya cannot move. If the shoot button is held for too long, the film will get overexposed and Aya would have to reload the film. The player can also press the shoot button once without holding to take a snapshot around Aya. For every picture taken, Aya will need to reload the film from 0% again before she can take another picture. Only photos that contain an image of the boss ("Success" [...] pictures) will be taken into account when tallying up the score.|$|E

40|$|Methods {{of noise}} {{coupling}} in <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> thick <b>film</b> circuits has been investigated. Parasitic coupling parameters have been experimentally determined {{for a variety}} of single and multilayer thick film layouts. In addition, the severity of the problem has been studied by measuring coupled noise induced on carefully constructed test cards.

5000|$|The iconic {{newsreel}} footage {{was shot}} by four newsreel camera teams: Pathé News, Movietone News, Hearst News of the Day, and Paramount News. Al Gold of Fox Movietone News later received a Presidential Citation for his work. One {{of the most widely}} circulated photographs of the disaster (see photo at top of article), showing the airship crashing with the mooring mast in the foreground, was photographed by Sam Shere of International News Photos. When the fire started {{he did not have the}} time to put the camera to his eye and shot the photo [...] "from the hip". Murray Becker of the Associated Press photographed the fire engulfing the airship while it was still on even keel using his 4 x 5 Speed Graphic camera. His next photograph (see right), shows flames bursting out of the nose as the bow telescoped upwards. In addition to professional photographers, spectators also photographed the crash. They were stationed in the spectator's area near Hangar No. 1, and had a side-rear view of the airship. Customs broker Arthur Cofod Jr. and 16 year-old Foo Chu both had Leica cameras with <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>film,</b> allowing them to take a larger number of photographs than the press photographers. Nine of Cofod's photographs were printed in LIFE magazine [...] while Chu's photographs were shown New York Daily News.|$|E
50|$|Measurements were {{generally}} expressed as scattered intensities or scattered irradiance. Since {{the collection of}} data was made as the detector was placed at different locations on the arc, each position corresponding to a different scattering angle, the concept of placing a separate detector at each angular location of interest was well understood, though not implemented commercially until the late 1970s. Multiple detectors having different quantum efficiency have different response and hence needs to be normalized in this scheme. An interesting system based upon the use of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>film</b> was developed by Brunsting and Mullaney in 1974. It permitted {{the entire range of}} scattered intensities to be recorded on the film with a subsequent densitometer scan providing the relative scattered intensities. The then-conventional use of a single detector rotated about an illuminated sample with intensities collected at specific angles was called differential light scattering after the quantum mechanical term differential cross section, σ(θ) expressed in milli-barns/steradian. Differential cross section measurements were commonly made, for example, to study the structure of the atomic nucleus by scattering from them nucleons, such as neutrons. It is important to distinguish between differential light scattering and dynamic light scattering, both of which are referred to by the initials DLS. The latter refers to a technique that is quite different, measuring the fluctuation of scattered light due to constructive and destructive interference, the frequency being linked to the thermal motion, Brownian motion of the molecules or particles in solution or suspension.|$|E

40|$|When a {{concentrated}} contact is lubricated {{at low speed}} by an oil-in-water emulsion, a film of pure oil typically separates the surfaces (Stage 1). At <b>higher</b> <b>speeds,</b> starvation occurs (Stage 2) and the film is thinner than would be expected if lubricated by neat oil. However, at the very <b>highest</b> <b>speeds,</b> <b>film</b> thickness increases again (Stage 3), though little is known for certain about either the film composition or the mechanism of lubrication, despite some theoretical speculation. In this paper, we report the film thickness in a ball-on-flat contact, lubricated by an oil-in-water emulsion, at speeds of up to 20 m/s, measured using a new high-speed test rig. We also investigated the sliding traction and the phase composition of the film, using fluorescent and infrared microscopy techniques. Results show that, as the speed is increased, starvation {{is followed by a}} progressive change in film composition, from pure oil to mostly water. At the <b>highest</b> <b>speeds,</b> a <b>film</b> builds up that has a phase composition similar to the bulk emulsion. This tends to support the "micro-emulsion" view rather than the “dynamic concentration” theory...|$|R

The burning was recorded with <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>film</b> at high magnification. Al was found to flash vaporize, melt, surface oxidize, revaporize, then combust. All species burned with a vapor diffusion flame surrounded by an oxide condensation front.

40|$|The hunting {{flight of}} the kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) {{consists}} of short bouts of flight at wind speed against the wind with the eyes in a fixed position relative to the ground, and of short flights from one such position to the next.

The four surfaces were: (1) Turbo-BIITM-LP (2) High-FluxTM, (3) GEWA-KTM, and (4) GEWA-TTM. The surfaces were either machined or soldered onto a flat thick oxygen-free high-conductivity copper plate. This permitted 20 sheathed thermocouples to be {{embedded in the}} copper for accurate heat transfer measurements. The difference between electric resistance and fluid heating was investigated. The fluid heating condition results in heat fluxes that areas much as 32 YO greater than those obtained by electric resistance heating. Hysteresis effects near the onset of nucleate boiling were also investigated.
