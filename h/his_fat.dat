5|$|It was {{reported}} by Entertainment Weekly that Pitt would don a fat suit for flashback scenes to <b>his</b> <b>fat</b> childhood, though this was unfounded as Will's weight was merely referred to on screen. Pitt frequently visited Aniston at the studios before and after his appearance, {{though he did not}} go onto the set for fear of distracting the audience. When questioned about his appearance in the show, Pitt said it was to promote his upcoming film Spy Game, though added that he liked the series anyway. The episode was taped on November 2, following four days of rehearsals.|$|E

He also transacts business in the slave trade. He has many slaves himself, and some he fed to the Rancor, a creature he kept caged and tormented in his dungeon.

500|$|The film {{review by}} Walton of The Moving Picture News and The Moving Picture World bear an unusual {{expression}} about laying siege to an heiress {{that is used}} in both summaries. Bowers says both reviews were probably adapted from a [...] "canned" [...] review supplied by Thanhouser. Though it is uncertain if the review by The Moving Picture World which was issued on October 15 was picked up and reused by the The Moving Picture News for the November 5 edition. The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer offered praise for the production in its summary, [...] "The Thanhouser players get considerable humor out of this comedy which is quite cleverly constructed and well acted. Leon is a waiter in a table d'hote restaurant. He bids <b>his</b> <b>fat</b> sweetheart, the restaurant cashier, good-bye and goes on his vacation, stopping at a seaside resort where he poses as a foreign count, captivates the ladies, and finds a rich mamma who wants to marry him to her daughter. The engagement gets into the papers, <b>his</b> <b>fat</b> sweetheart in town reads the news and takes the next train to the seaside hotel, where she makes short work of Leon, leading him off by the ear, to the great delight of the rich girl and her American lover. Amusing by-play is worked in, and the film pleases." [...] An advertisement for the Jewel Theatre in Winfield Daily Free Press claimed it {{to be better than}} Home Made Mince Pie.|$|E

2500|$|Following the season's {{end and the}} Rocket's {{elimination}} {{from the}} playoffs, Pippen expressed {{that he wanted to}} be traded. Charles Barkley appeared on Up Close and openly criticized Pippen by saying: [...] "For him to want to leave after one year, it disappointed me greatly. The Rockets went out of their way to get Scottie and the fans have treated him well, so I was just disappointed in him." [...] Pippen commented on the situation in an interview by saying: [...] "I wouldn't give Charles Barkley an apology at gunpoint. He can never expect an apology from me, if anything, he owes me an apology for coming to play with <b>his</b> <b>fat</b> butt." [...] He stated that the main reasons for his departure were Barkley's selfishness and his lack of desire to win. He also expressed the wish to play for his former coach Phil Jackson, who was now coaching the Los Angeles Lakers. Scottie said one of the reasons he wants to play for Jackson is because he longs to return to the system in which they won six NBA titles together in Chicago. Pippen was traded by the Houston Rockets to the Portland Trail Blazers on October 2, 1999 in exchange for Stacey Augmon, Kelvin Cato, Ed Gray, Carlos Rogers, Brian Shaw and Walt Williams.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Funnel and Stamate" [...] {{insists on}} the {{geographical}} setting of Urmuzian misadventures. Stamate's townhouse is {{a haven for}} objects or beings, their presence inventoried over several rooms. Only accessible through a tube, the windowless first room holds together {{a sample of the}} thing-in-itself, the statue of a Transylvanian priest and grammarian, and two humans always [...] "in the process of descending from the ape". The second room, decorated in [...] "Turkish style" [...] and [...] "eastern luxury", is painted once a day and carefully measured, by compass, to prevent shrinkage. A third section, under the [...] "Turkish" [...] room, houses a limitless canal, a tiny room and a stake [...] "to which the entire Stamate family is tethered." [...] The [...] "dignified" [...] and [...] "elliptical" [...] head of the clan spits chewed-up celluloid on <b>his</b> <b>fat</b> boy Bufty, who [...] "pretends not to notice". For relaxation, the Stamates contemplate Nirvana, located over the canal and [...] "in the same precinct" [...] as them. Old Stamate's musings are interrupted by the provocative intrusion of a siren, who lures him into the deep by presenting him with [...] "an innocent and too decent looking funnel." [...] Stamate returns [...] "a better and more tolerant man", deciding to use the funnel for both the pleasures of sex and those of science. Neglecting his family duties, he goes on nightly expeditions into the funnel, until he discovers in horror that Bufty uses the funnel for a similar purpose. Stamate then decides to part with his wife (sewing her in a bag, to [...] "preserve the cultural traditions of his family") and with Bufty: trapped in the funnel, the boy is sent over to Nirvana, where Stamate makes sure he becomes a [...] "bureau sub-chief". Stamate is left alone to contemplate his plight, wandering to and fro at great speed, and submerging [...] "into micro-infinity." ...|$|E
