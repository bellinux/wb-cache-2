5|$|The pier's {{secondary}} role {{was as a}} public pier, where pleasure craft were allowed to dock. Tour boats offering {{a view of the}} Kowloon side of the harbour used the pier for passenger boarding. Up to 1978, it was the <b>finishing</b> <b>line</b> for the annual cross-harbour swimming race. As the ceremonies declined, the pier's secondary purpose became the main one: people met and strolled in the area, and others fished.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} {{is located on}} the northern hill of the town, which has an elevation of 70 to 80 metres (230 to 260 feet). The hill is mostly covered in bushes and can be accessed by two paths. Currently it is used as an overlook for its panoramic view of the town. It also serves to mark the <b>finishing</b> <b>line</b> for the annual trekking trail competition, Desafío al Indio Comahue.|$|E

50|$|The first {{event was}} held in 1986, and was mapped out by Del Beaudoin. Since then, the course has {{remained}} mostly consistent. The original <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> was the Rose Bowl in Pasadena through 1991. In 1992 the <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> was shifted to Johnson's Field in the Arroyo, adjacent to the Arroyo Seco. In 2008 the <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> was moved to Loma Alta Park, in Altadena.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeThe aim of {{this study}} was to measure the length of <b>finish</b> <b>lines</b> {{associated}} with various commonly used preparation designs using high technology CAD/CAM. Materials and methodsA total of 80 extracted human permanent teeth (including 4 distinct morphologies) were divided into 8 groups according to the type of preparation design (all-ceramic crown, ceramic onlay, or ceramic veneer) and tooth type (upper first molar, lower first premolar, upper central incisor and lower central incisor). The length of the <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> for each specimen was measured after performing tooth preparation using Dental Wings 7 Series 3 D Scanners. The measured lengths associated with the various preparation designs were analyzed. ResultsThe length of the <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> was significantly different between complete- and partial-coverage tooth preparations, in which the partial coverage had a longer <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> than the complete coverage. ConclusionThe complete-coverage preparations evaluated in this study exhibited significantly shorter <b>finish</b> <b>lines</b> compared to the partial-coverage preparations. Clinical significantThe risk of recurrent caries has been directly related to the marginal integrity of any restoration. However, the relationship between the length of the <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> and recurrent decay may also be significant. Therefore, obtaining baseline information regarding the differences in <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> length of various preparation designs is important...|$|R
5|$|Anfield {{has been}} the venue for many other events. During the mid-twenties, Anfield was the <b>finishing</b> <b>line</b> for the city marathon. Liverpool held an annual race which started from St George's plateau in the city centre and {{finished}} with a lap of Anfield. Boxing matches were regularly held at Anfield during the inter-war years, including a number of British boxing championships; on 12 June 1934 Nel Tarleton beat Freddie Miller for the World Featherweight title. Professional tennis was played at Anfield on boards on the pitch. US Open champion, Bill Tilden, and Wimbledon champion, Fred Perry, entertained the crowds in an exhibition match. In 1958, an exhibition basketball match featuring the Harlem Globetrotters {{was held at the}} ground.|$|E
5|$|The new format {{meant that}} all cars {{took to the}} track quickly in Q1, with {{everyone}} setting lap times on the super-soft compound, the fastest tyre available at the event. The two Manor drivers were first to be eliminated, having set only one timed lap each, as were both Haas cars after them, being unable to cross the <b>finishing</b> <b>line</b> in time. The same fate caught out Daniil Kvyat, who qualified 18th. Both Sauber drivers {{were able to go}} out on a second timed lap, but proved too slow to avoid being the last to go out in Q1, after Renault rookie Jolyon Palmer was able to avoid elimination, setting a faster time towards the end of the session.|$|E
5|$|After {{over an hour}} {{behind the}} safety car, the field was {{released}} to race one last time with only twelve minutes remaining. With no close contests between the competitors, the field continued to run at less than racing pace, {{in preparation for the}} finish. The No. 8 Peugeot of Sébastien Bourdais briefly went into the pits, before returning to the track. To ensure that the Peugeot finished the race, and did not break down before crossing the <b>finishing</b> <b>line</b> behind the winner, Bourdais stopped at the Ford Chicanes on the final lap. Once the No. 1 Audi had gone past to take the checkered flag, Bourdais restarted the Peugeot and finished as well. The No. 16 Pescarolo finished the race in third, the highest placed petrol car.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was about}} this time that reports came through of a problem at the <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> - a bus for the [...] team had become stuck under the {{finishing}} arch. It was too tall to pass through. It disrupted the electronic timing for the stage, but the more pressing problem {{was the fact that}} the <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> was not clear to be covered by the cyclists. Race officials tried to extricate the bus, having no success for several minutes as the riders came nearer and nearer to the <b>finish</b> <b>line.</b> As the peloton passed through the 10 km to go mark, the decision was sent out over race radio for the <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> to be moved to the banner representing 3 km to the (original) <b>finish</b> <b>line.</b> Around this same time, the day's first major crash occurred, sending, among numerous others, 2012 Giro d'Italia champion Ryder Hesjedal off his bicycle. At approximately 6 km to go the original finish, meaning 3 km to go the revised <b>finish</b> <b>line,</b> teams such as [...] and [...] had begun their leadouts.|$|R
5|$|In the Olympic 100 m final, Bolt broke new ground, {{winning in}} 9.69 s (unofficially 9.683 s) with a {{reaction}} time of 0.165 s. This was an improvement upon {{his own world}} record, and he was well ahead of second-place finisher Richard Thompson, who finished in 9.89 s. Not only was the record set without a favourable wind (+0.0m/s), but he also visibly slowed down to celebrate before he finished and his shoelace was untied. Bolt's coach reported that, based upon the speed of Bolt's opening 60 m, he could have finished {{with a time of}} 9.52 s. After scientific analysis of Bolt's run by the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo, Hans Eriksen and his colleagues also predicted a sub 9.60 s time. Considering factors such as Bolt's position, acceleration and velocity in comparison with second-place-finisher Thompson, the team estimated that Bolt could have finished in 9.55±0.04 s had he not slowed to celebrate before the <b>finishing</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{match that}} aired was a Stretcher match between Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam, {{in which the}} object is to place your {{opponent}} on a stretcher and wheel the stretcher across a finish line. The match went back and forth before Van Dam attempted to perform a Somersault Plancha onto Orton, but Orton moved out of the way. Orton put Van Dam on the stretcher and tried to wheel him across the <b>finishing</b> <b>line.</b> Van Dam, however, managed to kick Orton in the head and put him onto the stretcher. Van Dam wheeled the stretcher over the line for the win. After the match, Orton attacked Van Dam, executing an Elevated DDT off the barricade onto the arena floor. Van Dam was then carried out of the arena on the stretcher.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, Bolt ran as {{the third}} leg in the Jamaican 4x100 metres relay team, {{increasing}} his gold medal total to three. Along with teammates Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, and Asafa Powell, Bolt broke another world and Olympic record, their 37.10 s finish breaking the previous record by three-tenths of a second. Powell, who anchored the team to the <b>finishing</b> <b>line,</b> lamented {{the loss of his}} 100 m record to Bolt but showed no animosity towards his Jamaican rival, stating that he was delighted to help him set his third world record. In January 2017 the Jamaican relay team were stripped of their gold medals after a blood sample taken from Nesta Carter - one of Bolt's teammates in the relay - after the race, was tested again nine years later and tested positive for a banned substance. Following his victories, Bolt donated US$50,000 to the children of Sichuan province in China to help those harmed by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.|$|E
40|$|MastersThe {{review of}} the {{literature}} reflects variable results regarding the effect of veneering porcelain on the marginal fit of the crown coping in metal ceramic and all-ceramic restorations in relation to different <b>finish</b> <b>lines,</b> materials and systems. As the zirconia material is gaining popularity these days due to its exceptional strength and fracture toughness combined with promising esthetic results achieved by the application of its recommended veneering porcelain, {{the purpose of the study}} was to reveal the effect of Cercon® Ceram Kiss veneering porcelain (DeguDent/ Germany) on the marginal fit of Cercon® zirconia coping (Cercon® Smart Ceramic System/ DeguDent/ Hanau/ Germany) in relation to 1 mm shoulder and chamfer <b>finish</b> <b>lines.</b> Two master stainless steel models of a single posterior full-crown preparation were machined for the shoulder and chamfer <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> preparations. Then duplicated into stone models that were scanned by Cercon® Smart Ceramic System to produce thirty Cercon zirconia copings for each <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> preparation which were veneered later with Cercon® Ceram kiss veneering porcelain. The assessment of the marginal fit of the specimens was performed on the stainless steel master models in relation to 31 defined points secured with the specimen positioning device (SPD) using the direct view technique with the aid of the Traveling Measuring Microscope in relation to 1 mm shoulder and chamfer <b>finish</b> <b>lines</b> before and after the addition of the veneering porcelain. The data were statistically analyzed using Student paired and independent ttests to compare the marginal fit of Cercon® zirconia coping before and after adding the veneering porcelain for the shoulder and chamfer <b>finish</b> <b>lines</b> separately and the marginal fit of the final crowns of both the shoulder and chamfer <b>finish</b> <b>lines</b> respectively. The results indicated that the addition of veneering porcelain significantly affected the marginal fit of both <b>finish</b> <b>lines</b> preparations (P< 0. 05). The mean marginal fit of cercon® zirconia coping was (32. 23 =m ± 6. 14) for shoulder <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> and (97. 68 =m ± 9. 20) for chamfer <b>finish</b> <b>line.</b> However, the mean marginal fit of the final crown of shoulder <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> preparation (Mean of 54. 09 ± 7. 69 =m) was significantly better than the chamfer <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> preparation (Mean of 80. 85 ± 9. 29 =m).

40|$|The {{current study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} different cervical <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> designs on the marginal adaptation of a zirconia ceramic. Four different marginal <b>finish</b> <b>lines</b> (c: chamfer, mc: mini-chamfer, fe: feather-edge and s: rounded shoulder) were prepared on phantom incisors. Die models for each preparation group (N = 28, n = 7 per <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> design group) were made of epoxy resin. Y-TZP (ICE Zirkon) frameworks were manufactured by a copy-milling system (Zirconzahn) using prefabricated blanks and tried on the master models for initial adaptation of the framework; they were then sintered, followed by veneering (Zirconzahn). The finished crowns were cemented with a polycarboxylate cement (Poly F) under 300 g load and ultrasonically cleaned. The specimens were sliced and the marginal gap was measured, considering absolute marginal opening (AMO) and marginal opening (MO) for each coping under a stereomicroscope with image processing software (Lucia). The measurements were statistically analyzed using the Kruskal Wallis, Mann Whitney and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests at a significance level of alpha = 0. 01. Means of AMO measurement (microm) for the feather-edge <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> (87 +/- 10) was significantly {{lower than that of}} the chamfer (144 +/- 14), shoulder (114 +/- 16) and mini-chamfer <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> types (114 +/- 11) (p < 0. 01). Means of MO measurements was the lowest for feather-edge <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> (68 +/- 9) (p < 0. 01) and then, in ascending order, shoulder (95 +/- 9), mini-chamfer (97 +/- 12) and chamfer (128 +/- 10). The cervical <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> type had an influence on the marginal adaptation of the tested zirconia ceramic. Although the feather-edge <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> resulted in lower AMO and MO values, with its proven mechanical disadvantage, it cannot be recommended in clinical applications of zirconia crowns. This type of <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> has acted solely as a control group to test the null hypothesis in the current study. For better marginal adaptation, both shoulder and mini-chamfer <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> types could be suggested for zirconia crowns...|$|R
5|$|The {{end of the}} 2008 {{athletics}} season saw Bolt {{compete in}} the ÅF Golden League, beginning in Weltklasse Zürich. Despite having the slowest start among his competitors in the 100 m race, he still crossed the <b>finishing</b> <b>line</b> in 9.83 s. Even though the time was slower than both his newly set world record and Asafa Powell's track record, it was still among the top-fifteen 100 m finishes by any sprinter to that date. Bolt admitted {{that he was not}} running at full strength, suffering from a cold, but he had concentrated on both winning the race and finishing the season in good health. At the Super Grand Prix final in Lausanne, Bolt ran his second-fastest 200 m with a time of 19.63 s, equalling Xavier Carter's track record. However, it was the 100 m final, featuring Asafa Powell, that drew the most interest. Powell had moved closer to Bolt's world record after setting a new personal best of 9.72 s, reaffirming his status as Bolt's main contender. Bolt's final event of the season came three days later at the Golden League final in Brussels. This was the first 100 m race featuring both Bolt and Powell since the final in the Olympics. Both Jamaicans broke the track record, but Bolt came out on top with a time of 9.77 s, beating Powell by 0.06 s. Victory, however, did not come as smoothly as it had in Beijing. Bolt made the slowest start of the nine competitors and had to recover ground in cold conditions and against a 0.9m/s headwind. Yet the results confirmed Jamaican dominance in the 100 m, with nine of the ten-fastest legal times in history being recorded by either Bolt or Powell.|$|E
