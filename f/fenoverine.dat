AimsTo determine the clinical effectiveness of the antispasmodic agents available in Mexico {{for the treatment of}} IBS. MethodsWe carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials on antispasmodic agents for IBS treatment. Clinical trials identified from January 1960 to May 2011 were searched for in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and in the ClinicalTrials. gov registry. Treatment response was evaluated by global improvement of symptoms or abdominal pain, abdominal distention/bloating, and frequency of adverse events. The effect of antispasmodics vs placebo was expressed in OR and 95 % CI. ResultsTwenty-seven studies were identified, 23 of which fulfilled inclusion criteria. The studied agents were pinaverium bromide, mebeverine, otilonium, trimebutine, alverine, hyoscine, alverine/simethicone, pinaverium/simethicone, <b>fenoverine,</b> and dicyclomine. A total of 2585 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Global improvement was 1. 55 (CI 95 %: 1. 33 to 1. 83). Otilonium and the alverine/simethicone combination produced significant values in global improvement while the pinaverium/simethicone combination showed improvement in bloating. As for pain, 2394 patients were included with an OR of 1. 52 (IC 95 %: 1. 28 a 1. 80), favoring antispasmodics. ConclusionsAntispasmodics were more effective than placebo in IBS, without any significant adverse events. The addition of simethicone improved the properties of the antispasmodic agents, as seen with the alverine/simethicone and pinaverium/simethicone combinations...|$|E
