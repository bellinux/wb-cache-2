5|$|Nonpolar {{antioxidants}} such as eugenol—a {{major component}} of oil of cloves—have toxicity limits that can be exceeded with the misuse of undiluted essential oils. Toxicity associated with <b>high</b> <b>doses</b> of water-soluble antioxidants such as ascorbic acid are less of a concern, as these compounds can be excreted rapidly in urine. More seriously, very <b>high</b> <b>doses</b> of some antioxidants may have harmful long-term effects. The beta-carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) study of lung cancer patients found that smokers given supplements containing beta-carotene and vitamin A had increased rates of lung cancer.

5|$|The {{effects of}} the drug begin 10–40minutes after ingestion, and last 2–6hours {{depending}} on dose, species, and individual metabolism. The half life of psilocybin is 163±64minutes when taken orally, or 74.1±19.6minutes when injected intravenously. A dosage of 4–10mg, corresponding roughly to 50–300micrograms per kilogram (µg/kg) of body weight, is required to induce psychedelic effects. A typical recreational dosage is 10–50mg psilocybin, which is roughly equivalent to 10–50grams of fresh mushrooms, or 1–5grams of dried mushrooms. A {{small number of people}} are unusually sensitive to psilocybin, such that a normally threshold-level dose of about 2mg can result in effects usually associated with medium or <b>high</b> <b>doses.</b> In contrast, there are some who require relatively <b>high</b> <b>doses</b> to experience noticeable effects. Individual brain chemistry and metabolism play a large role in determining a person's response to psilocybin.|$|E
5|$|BZP also {{acts as a}} non-selective {{serotonin}} {{receptor agonist}} {{on a wide variety}} of serotonin receptors; binding to 5HT2A receptors may explain its mild hallucinogenic effects at <b>high</b> <b>doses,</b> while partial agonist or antagonist effects at the 5HT2B receptors may explain some of BZPs peripheral side effects, as this receptor is expressed very densely in the gut, and binding to 5HT3 receptors may explain the common side effect of headaches, as this receptor is known to be involved in the development of migraine headaches.|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of low <b>dose</b> vs <b>high</b> <b>dose</b> of amphotericin B in cryptococcal meningitis associated with HIV infection. Materials and Methods: Retrospective data of patients admitted with clinical diagnosis with or without microbiological evidence of cryptococcal meningitis was collected from Jan 2000 -Mar 2006. Patients&#x 2032; details were collected in a proforma which included patient&#x 2032;s age, weight, {{signs and symptoms of}} disease and microbiological report (blood and CSF analysis). Data also included coexisting disease; concomitant medications taken along with amphotericin B. Adverse drug reactions which occurred during the period of treatment were recorded. Patients were grouped as low <b>dose</b> group and <b>high</b> <b>dose</b> group depending on the dose of amphotericin B given for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis. Patients who received amphotericin B at doses of 0. 33 to 0. 64 mg/kg body weight per day were categorized under low dose group and patients who received amphotericin B at doses of 0. 7 to 1. 1 mg/kg/day were categorized under <b>high</b> <b>dose</b> group. All data were pooled and analyzed between the groups using chi square test. Result: Total number of patients included in the study were 38, 26 in the low dose group and 12 in the <b>high</b> <b>dose</b> group. In the low dose group, 20 were males and six were females, in the <b>high</b> <b>dose</b> group eight were males and four were females. The commonest underlying diseases were tuberculosis (17 in low dose group, nine in <b>high</b> <b>dose</b> group), Pneumocystis carinii (jeroveci) pneumonia (16 in low dose group, seven in <b>high</b> <b>dose</b> group) and oral candidiasis (eight in low dose group, seven in <b>high</b> <b>dose</b> group), Toxoplasmosis (three in low dose group, one in <b>high</b> <b>dose</b> group), hypertension (1 in group A) and diabetes mellitus (1 in group B). Concomitant medication received along with amphotericin B for coexisting diseases in both the groups were antitubercular therapy, cotrimoxazole, antiviral therapy and premedications such as Ondansetran, Domperidone, Diclofenac, Mannitol, Dexamethazone and Pheniramine. Comparison between the groups showed that the cure rate is similar in both the groups (P = 0. 440, where as over all mortality was <b>higher</b> in low <b>dose</b> group than in <b>high</b> <b>dose</b> group which was statistically significant (P = 0. 03). Adverse effects were <b>higher</b> in <b>high</b> <b>dose</b> group than in low dose group such as hypokalemia (P = 0. 04), facial puffiness (P = 0. 01). Other adverse effects were comparable in both the groups. Conclusion: <b>High</b> <b>dose</b> of amphotericin B therapy is more efficacious. However hypokalemia and clinical features of nephrotoxicity was higher with patients on <b>high</b> <b>dose</b> therapy, which can be managed by proper monitoring...|$|R

25|$|The {{two issues}} of shot noise and EUV-released {{electrons}} point out two constraining factors: 1) keeping <b>dose</b> <b>high</b> enough to reduce shot noise to tolerable levels, but also 2) avoiding too <b>high</b> a <b>dose</b> {{due to the}} increased contribution of EUV-released photoelectrons and secondary electrons to the resist exposure process, increasing the edge blur and thereby limiting the resolution. Aside from the resolution impact, <b>higher</b> <b>dose</b> also increases outgassing and limits throughput, and crosslinking occurs at very <b>high</b> <b>dose</b> levels.

40|$|Introduction: FDA-mandated product {{standards}} that drastically reduce nicotine content in cigarettes {{may result in}} decreased smoking and thus, improved health outcomes for millions of U. S. smokers. One issue is whether the rate of smoking at reduced nicotine contents would be different for current smokers from individuals who start smoking {{for the first time}} at the reduced content. Method: 48 rats were given the opportunity to self-administer at one of four low nicotine doses (15, 7. 5, 3. 75, 0. 0 µg/kg/infusion) before and after self-administering a <b>higher</b> <b>dose</b> of nicotine (60 µg/kg/infusion). A second group of 57 rats acquired self-administration at the <b>high</b> nicotine <b>dose</b> before experiencing reduction. A cocktail of other cigarette constituents was included in the vehicle and remained constant across the study. Results: The rate of self-administration across the low doses (including vehicle) was higher following self-administration of a <b>high</b> <b>dose.</b> Rates of self-administration following reduction from the <b>high</b> nicotine <b>dose</b> were the same regardless of whether the rats originally acquired at a low <b>dose</b> or the <b>high</b> <b>dose.</b> The effect of self-administering a <b>high</b> nicotine <b>dose</b> was <b>highest</b> for a threshold dose (7. 5 µg/kg/infusion). Discussion: The present study suggests rate of self-administering low nicotine doses may be increased by having a history of <b>high</b> <b>dose</b> self-administration. The large effect at a threshold nicotine dose may indicate a shift in the threshold for maintaining behavior as a result of experience with <b>higher</b> <b>doses</b> of nicotine. These data would support the idea that current smokers may smoke at a higher intensity following nicotine reduction than individuals who begin smoking {{for the first time at}} the reduced rate. Furthermore, the rate of self-administration following reduction was the same regardless of whether rats acquired at the <b>high</b> <b>dose</b> of nicotine or experienced a low dose before being changed over to a <b>high</b> nicotine <b>dose...</b>|$|R
