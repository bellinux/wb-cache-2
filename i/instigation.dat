40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} obsessive passion for work and incivility <b>instigations,</b> {{as well as the}} moderating role of a mastery motivational climate. A longitudinal, three-wave study was conducted among 1, 263 employees from a large Norwegian workers’ union across a 10 -month time span. The results show that obsessive passion for work relates positively to incivility <b>instigations</b> and that this relationship is stable over time. Building on the person–environment fit perspective, we find that the relationship between obsessive passion for work and incivility <b>instigations</b> is stronger for employees with both high levels of obsessive passion and high perceptions of a mastery climate. Our results underline the importance of considering not only the individual in his/her context, but also of considering the match between the individual’s values and the contextual values...|$|R

This study develops and tests a social context {{model of the}} victimization of high performing employees {{with a focus on}} (1) unfavorable social comparison mechanisms that occur between high performers and other fellow employees and (2) work group contextual factors that may exacerbate or mitigate these social comparison mechanisms. Multisource data collected at two time points support the proposition that high performers {{are more likely to be}} targets of victimization because of unintentional <b>instigations</b> (i. e., fellow group members' envy and competition), but not because of intentional <b>instigations</b> (i. e., high performers' condescending behaviors). Next, this study generally supports the proposition that collective identity and justice climate mitigate unfavorable social comparison mechanisms and high performance victim phenomenon whereas climate of concern for employees, social interaction, and transformational leadership did not mitigate these phenomena...|$|R

5|$|As a character, Spencer {{has been}} seen as an everyman figure, his blank {{expression}} and plain dress keeping him a simple archetype. Spencer displays a pacifistic and fatalistic inactivity throughout the film, simply allowing events to unfold around him without taking control. This passive behavior culminates in his sole act of <b>instigation</b> at the film's climax; his apparent act of infanticide is driven by his life of being domineered and controlled. Spencer's inactivity has also been seen by film critics Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc as a precursor to Lynch's 1983–92 comic strip The Angriest Dog in the World.|$|E

His handling of the situation earned him praise as a comparatively restrained and progressive leader.|$|E
