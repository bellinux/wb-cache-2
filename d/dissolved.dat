5|$|<b>Dissolved</b> {{oxygen in}} fresh water is {{measured}} {{to indicate the}} health {{of plant and animal}} life. It enters water through the atmosphere and from aquatic plant photosynthesis, and is affected by water pressure and temperature. Rapid decomposition of organic materials will decrease the amount of <b>dissolved</b> oxygen in the river, as will nutrients added to the water artificially by wastewater treatment runoff or drainage from fertilized agricultural fields. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Florida recommend no less than 5mg of oxygen per liter. Several locations on the St. Johns or its tributaries reported at or below these minimums in the 1990s, including the mouth of the Wekiva River, the St. Johns at the town of Christmas, and in the early 2000s at Blue Spring and Blackwater Creek. Sustained low levels of <b>dissolved</b> oxygen may create algal blooms, which may also cause a further decrease in <b>dissolved</b> oxygen.|$|E

5|$|Mephedrone can be {{synthesised}} {{in several}} ways. The simplest method, {{due to the}} availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone <b>dissolved</b> in glacial acetic acid to bromine, creating an oil fraction of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The oil fraction can then be <b>dissolved</b> in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing methylamine hydrochloride and triethylamine. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is then added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum, creating an oil which is then <b>dissolved</b> in a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through the mixture to produce 4-methylmethcathinone hydrochloride. This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA.|$|E

40|$|A <b>dissolve</b> is {{a gradual}} {{transition}} from one shot {{to another in}} a video, resulting from gradually scaling the intensity values of the two shots. Up to now, there have been very few algorithms for detecting <b>dissolves.</b> By analysing characteristics exhibited by a typical <b>dissolve,</b> we propose two methods of detecting <b>dissolves</b> directly in MPEG compressed video. The first method {{is based on the}} characteristics that the average intensity of each frame changes linearly with time during a <b>dissolve.</b> <b>Dissolves</b> are detected by finding rectangular shapes on the difference curve of the average frame intensity values, which can be obtained by averaging the DC values of luminance blocks of each frame in an MPEG stream. The second method is based on the characteristics that each pixel changes its intensity value linearly and gradually during a <b>dissolve.</b> As a result, most of the pixel difference values between two consecutive frames will be moderate and fall within a range. This range is determined by the duration of a typical <b>dissolve</b> and the maximal intensity difference allowed. If the number of pixels with difference values falling within such a range is large over a period of time, a <b>dissolve</b> can be declared. For an MPEG stream, we define a measure as the percentage of blocks with DC difference values falling within a specified range. <b>Dissolves</b> are thus detected by finding periods with consistent large values of. Both methods have been tested on a range of MPEG video sequences and the results show that most <b>dissolves</b> can be correctly detected. Since the proposed methods operate directly on compressed data, they are much more efficient than some pixel domain methods...|$|R
