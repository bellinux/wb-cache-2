According to this now-established account, one of Khánh's men took Nhung to the garden of a Saigon villa and forced him to kneel, before executing him with a single gunshot {{to the back of}} the head. Nhung's death led to protests among the Saigon public, who took the killing to be a signal that the remaining members of Diệm's regime would be reinstated to positions of authority.|$|E

25|$|As time progressed, the Seminole and Blacks {{had limited}} intermarriage; but historians and anthropologists <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{generally}} the Black Seminoles had independent communities. They {{allied with the}} Seminole at times of war. The Seminole society {{was based on a}} matrilineal kinship system, in which inheritance and descent went through the maternal line. Children were considered to belong to the mother's clan, so those born to ethnic African mothers would have been considered black by the Seminole. While the children might integrate customs from both parents' cultures, the Seminole believed they belonged to the mother's group more than the father's.|$|E

We British have a thousand year history of self-government. We have been free and democratic longer than any other nation. The European Union is too diverse, too bureaucratic, too corporatist and too centralist to be a functioning democracy. We are happy to trade with our European friends {{and the rest of}} the world – but we would prefer to govern ourselves.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, many {{researchers}} <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> one variant of the northeastern Iberian script, the older one according to the archaeological contexts, distinguished voicing in the plosives by adding a stroke to the glyphs for the alveolar (/d/~/t/) and velar (/g/~/k/) syllables, creating distinct glyphs for unvoiced /t/ and /k/, and restricting the original glyphs to voiced /d/ and /g/. (This is the so-called dual signary model: see northeastern Iberian script.) If correct, this innovation would parallel {{the creation of the}} Latin letter G by the addition of a stroke to C, which had previously stood for both /k/ and /g/.|$|E
25|$|As of the 21st century, the Bnei Menashe <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{the legendary}} Kuki-Mizo {{ancestor}} Manmasi was the Hebrew Menasseh, son of Joseph. This group of Chin-Kuki-Mizo people began a Messianic movement during the 1950s. While believing that Y'shua (Jesus) is the promised messiah for all Israelites, these pioneers {{in the early}} 1960s adopted observance of the Jewish Sabbath, holidays, dietary laws and other Jewish customs and traditions which they learned from books. They had no connections with other Jewish groups in the diaspora or in Israel. On May 31, 1972, some Messianic communities founded the Manipur Jewish Organization (later renamed United Jews Organization, NEI), the first Jewish organization in northeast India.|$|E

Studies of comparative religion, however, have demonstrated recurring motifs and symbols in unrelated religions and peoples in many regions. In addition, other Mizo-Kuki-Hmar people say that this song is an ancient one of their culture. The song includes references to enemies chasing the people over a red-coloured sea, quails, and a pillar of cloud. Such images and symbols are not exclusive to Judaism.|$|E

2500|$|A longstanding issue {{among members}} of the church is whether it is {{permissible}} to ingest drinks containing caffeine that are not coffee or tea. In 1918, Frederick J.

Since Pack's article, many Latter-day Saints <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the reason tea and coffee are proscribed is the presence of caffeine in the drinks.

2500|$|Indians in {{the eastern}} lowland {{department}} of Santa Cruz have also become active in the recent disputes over nationalization of the gas and oil industry. They are composed of indigenous {{groups such as the}} Guaraní, Ayoreo, Chiquitano and the Guyarayos, as opposed to the highland Indians (Aymara and Quechua). They have been active in recent land disputes and the main organization representing this faction is known as the [...] "Confederacion de pueblos indigenas de Bolivia" [...] (CIDOB). The CIDOB after initially offering support to MAS, the party of Bolivia's new president, <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they were deceived by the Bolivian government. [...] The MAS, which is based in the highlands, is no more willing to grant them voice than the previous governments whose power was also based from the highlands.
