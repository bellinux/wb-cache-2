5|$|The {{first few}} (1–3 in Ayt Ayache and Ayt Ndhir) {{cardinal}} numerals have native Berber and borrowed Arabic forms. All higher cardinals are borrowed from Arabic, {{consistent with the}} linguistic universals that the numbers 1–3 {{are much more likely}} to be retained, and that a borrowed number generally implies that numbers greater than it are also borrowed. The retention of one is also motivated by the fact that Berber languages near-universally use unity as a <b>determiner.</b>|$|E
5|$|Possessive pronouns {{exist in}} {{dependent}} and independent forms; the dependent form {{functions as a}} <b>determiner</b> specifying a noun (as in my chair), while the independent form can stand alone {{as if it were}} a noun (e.g. the chair is mine). The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address, and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as y'all found in Southern American English and African American (Vernacular) English or youse and ye found in Irish English.|$|E
5|$|The {{class of}} determiners {{is used to}} specify the noun they precede in terms of {{definite}}ness, where the marks a definite noun and a or an an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include one, many, some and all, are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree {{with the number of}} the <b>determiner,</b> e.g. one man (sg.) but all men (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.|$|E
5000|$|The null <b>determiners</b> are {{subdivided}} {{into the same}} classes as overt <b>determiners</b> are, since the different null <b>determiners</b> are thought to appear in different grammatical contexts: ...|$|R
50|$|Linguists today {{distinguish}} <b>determiners</b> from adjectives, considering {{them to be}} {{two separate}} parts of speech (or lexical categories), but formerly <b>determiners</b> {{were considered to be}} adjectives in some of their uses. In English dictionaries, which typically still do not treat <b>determiners</b> as their own part of speech, <b>determiners</b> are often recognizable by being listed both as adjectives and as pronouns. <b>Determiners</b> are words that are neither nouns nor pronouns, yet reference a thing already in context. <b>Determiners</b> generally do this by indicating definiteness (as in a vs. the), quantity (as in one vs. some vs. many), or another such property.|$|R
50|$|Adjectives, demonstrative <b>determiners,</b> and possessive <b>determiners</b> {{follow the}} noun they modify.|$|R
5|$|Nouns {{can form}} noun phrases (NPs) {{where they are}} the {{syntactic}} head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives. Noun phrases can be short, such as the man, composed only of a <b>determiner</b> and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. red, tall, all) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. the, that). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as and, or prepositions such as with, e.g. the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit. For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in The President of India's wife, where the enclitic follows India and not President.|$|E
5|$|SJS has {{roots in}} {{criminal}} trials during the Vietnam War era, but {{in modern times}} is usually employed in high-stakes civil litigation (where only money is usually at issue, in contrast to criminal trials, where the defendant can go to prison). SJS practitioners determine what background characteristics and attitudes predict favorable results, and then coordinate with attorneys in choosing the jury. Studies are mixed as {{to the effectiveness of}} the practice, though {{it is clear that the}} evidence presented at trial is the most important <b>determiner</b> of verdicts (the trial result) and that SJS is more likely to have an impact where that evidence is ambiguous. SJS's potential to unfairly skew the jury has led to some reform proposals, but none have yet been implemented. The limited fictional portrayals of SJS have been negative towards the practice.|$|E
5|$|Music intertwines with {{aspects of}} American social and {{cultural}} identity, including through social class, race and ethnicity, geography, religion, language, gender, and sexuality. The relationship between music and race {{is perhaps the most}} potent <b>determiner</b> of musical meaning in the United States. The development of an African American musical identity, out of disparate sources from Africa and Europe, has been a constant theme in the music history of the United States. Little documentation exists of colonial-era African American music, when styles, songs, and instruments from across West Africa commingled in the melting pot of slavery. By the mid-19th century, a distinctly African American folk tradition was well-known and widespread, and African American musical techniques, instruments, and images became a part of mainstream American music through spirituals, minstrel shows, and slave songs. African American musical styles became an integral part of American popular music through blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and then rock and roll, soul, and hip hop; all of these styles were consumed by Americans of all races, but were created in African American styles and idioms before eventually becoming common in performance and consumption across racial lines. In contrast, country music derives from both African and European, as well as Native American and Hawaiian, traditions and yet has long been perceived as a form of white music.|$|E

25|$|In the {{inalienable}} reading, arm is {{a complement}} of the <b>determiner</b> phrase. This contrasts to the alienable reading where John has an arm {{is part of}} the <b>determiner.</b> Fillmore and Chomsky make a syntactic distinction between alienable and inalienable possession and suggest that this distinction is relevant to English.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all other}} {{languages}} of the Mesoamerican linguistic area, Otomi has a vigesimal number system. The following numerals are from Classical Otomi {{as described by}} Cárceres. The e prefixed to all numerals except one is the plural nominal <b>determiner</b> (the a associated with -nʔda being the singular <b>determiner).</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>determiner</b> suffix is {{attached}} to the final word of the noun phrase, not just the agentive noun.|$|E
5000|$|Prefixes derive possessive <b>determiners</b> in Neverver. Most {{of these}} {{begin with the}} possessive prefix t-. In Neverver, possessive <b>determiners</b> refer {{exclusively}} to human possessors, and a different construction is used to express non-human possessors. Below is a table showing the possessive <b>determiners</b> paradigm:(Barbour, p. 75) ...|$|R

25|$|Inflecting a noun, pronoun, adjective, {{article or}} <b>determiner</b> {{is known as}} declining it. The affixes may express number, case, or gender.|$|E
25|$|Relative clauses {{are marked}} with final determiners. If the {{definite}} referent {{of the relative}} clause has already been accounted in the discourse or is otherwise obvious, the relative clause is marked with the definite /-sh/. Relative clauses can also be marked with the indefinite <b>determiner</b> marker /-m/; generally this is used {{to imply that the}} referent is being introduced into the discourse for the first time. However, the nominal head is almost always marked by the indefinite <b>determiner</b> /-m/.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes that}} {{there are two types of}} <b>determiners,</b> one making use of feature {{checking}} and the other relying on binding. The typology of head-internal relative clauses (HIRC) is shown to be sensitive to this parametrization of quantificational <b>determiners.</b> Since the syntax of HIRC is generally correlated with that of wh-in-situ, it will also be claimed that the parametrization of <b>determiners</b> affects the properties of wh-in-situ as well. Key words: <b>determiners,</b> head-internal relative clauses, wh-in-sit...|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} example shows {{a sequence}} of nested phrases in which each head precedes its complement. In the complementizer phrase (CP) in (a), the complementizer (C) precedes its tense phrase (TP) complement. In the tense phrase in (b), the tense-marking element (T) precedes its verb phrase (VP) complement. (The subject of the tense phrase, the girl, is a specifier, which {{does not need to}} be considered when analyzing the ordering of head and complement.) In the verb phrase in (c), the verb (V) precedes its two complements, namely the <b>determiner</b> phrase (DP) the book and the prepositional phrase (PP) on the table. In (d), where a picture is analyzed as a <b>determiner</b> phrase, the <b>determiner</b> (D) a precedes its noun phrase (NP) complement, while in (e), the preposition (P) on precedes its DP complement your desk.|$|E
25|$|A {{noun phrase}} can be marked as {{definite}} or indefinite by a suffixed <b>determiner</b> (DET). The definite suffix is /-sh/ and the indefinite suffix is /-m/.|$|E
25|$|Personal names {{constitute}} a distinct morphological class of nouns in Crow. They are {{marked with the}} definite <b>determiner</b> suffix /sh/, which attaches to the stem {{rather than to the}} citation form.|$|E
25|$|The determinative adjectives, or <b>determiners,</b> are an {{essential}} part of the language, although Turkish takes some of its <b>determiners</b> from Arabic and Persian.|$|R

25|$|When {{determining}} the binding possibilities of a bound variable pronoun, {{in addition to}} the above conditions, the bound variable pronoun must also be c-commanded by the quantified <b>determiner</b> phrase that is its antecedent.|$|E
25|$|A bound {{variable}} pronoun (also {{called a}} bound variable anaphor or BVA) is a pronoun {{that has a}} quantified <b>determiner</b> phrase (DP) – such as every, some, or who – as its antecedent.|$|E
25|$|Inalienable {{possession}} {{can also}} be marked with external possession. These are constructions in which the possessor appears outside of the <b>determiner</b> phrase. For example, the possessor may appear as a dative complement of the verb.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Determiners</b> {{are used}} in the {{formation}} of noun phrases (see above). Many words that serve as <b>determiners</b> can also be used as pronouns (this, that, many, etc.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Note {{that the}} term [...] "possessive pronoun" [...] is also {{sometimes}} applied to the possessive <b>determiners</b> ("my", [...] "your", etc.), which are discussed at French articles and <b>determiners.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Possessive <b>determiners</b> are {{not used}} in {{combination}} with articles or other definite <b>determiners.</b> For example, it is not correct to say *the my hat, *a my hat or *this my hat; an alternative is provided {{in the last two}} cases by the [...] "double genitive" [...] as described in the following section - a hat of mine (also one of my hats), this hat of mine. Possessive <b>determiners</b> can nonetheless be combined with certain quantifiers, as in my six hats (which differs in meaning from six of my hats). See English <b>determiners</b> for more details.|$|R
