40|$|This study {{elucidates}} the key {{success of}} using statistical modelling {{in the design}} and development of a new product (milk toffee) as potential new functional food product. The standard milk toffee recipe was modified in order to produce new products with less sugar, more inulin, and decreased energy content. From the consumers point of view, a product has to be healthy (acceptable ingredients like low sugar content or inclusion of inulin) and tasty (good sensory properties). This is an opportunity to use chemometric strategies that can highlight information in relation to different ingredients and preferable taste attributes. Multivariate exploratory techniques were used in order to detect relationship between the milk toffee ingredients (sugar, water, condensed milk, glucose syrup, fat, salt, sorbitol, and emulsifier <b>E</b> <b>471)</b> and sensory attributes of taste and texture (sweetness and hardness) chosen for this research.

Behenic acid is produced from rapeseed–mustard seed variants prevalent in India,namely Brassica juncea (L.) Czern. (oriental mustard), Brassica rapa (L.)

No humanor animal allergenicity data were provided by the applic ant for either behenic acid or the emulsiﬁersmanufactured from beheni c acid. Based on enzyme-linke d immunosorbent assay (ELISA) data, thePanel considers that proteins and peptides may not be carried over into behenic acid after the twodistillation steps reported in the manufacturing process in amounts beyond 1 mg/kg. The Panel notesthat the maximum amount of mustard protein that could be consumed from emulsiﬁers manufacturedfrom behenic acid (E 470 a, <b>E</b> <b>471</b> and E 477) on a single occasion by an adult under the proposedconditions of use would be around 0. 00119 mg, which is about 1, 000 times lower than the proteindoses repo rted to trigger allergic reactions in mustard-allergic individuals (around 1 mg).

40|$|Woodcock Scolopax rusticola is an {{important}} game species in Northern Spain, where it is mainly a wintering species. Knowledge about the migration and origin of the woodcock wintering in Spain is relatively sparse, existing to date only qualitative analyses dating more than a decade. From the analyses of ringing recoveries of woodcock wintering in Spain, we evaluate {{the relative importance of}} various countries or regions as sources of the woodcock wintering in Spain, an estimate of their migratory route. Our analyses show the Circum-Baltic Region {{to be the most important}} breeding area of the woodcock wintering in Spain. Within that area, both Sweden and Western Russia appear to be particularly important. Analyses of the ringing locations of woodcock ringed during migration and recovered in Spain in winter suggest that woodcock wintering in Spain migrate primarily through the South of the Baltic Sea, Germany and France. The proportion of woodcock ringed in different French regions during the postnuptial migration months (October and November) that was subsequently recovered in Spain (mainly through hunting) declined with the proportion of those birds that was recovered in France (also mainly through hunting).

A PrgJ nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) binding site mutation (K <b>471</b> <b>E)</b> slightly diminished ATP binding but abolished ATP hydrolysis in vitro and blocked pCF 10 transfer in vivo. As shown with affinity pulldown assays, PrgJ and the K 471 Emutant protein interacted with the substrate receptor PcfC and with relaxase PcfG and accessory factor PcfF, which together form the relaxosome at the oriT sequence to initiate plasmid processing. The pu-rified PrgJ and K <b>471</b> <b>E</b> proteins also bound single- and double-stranded DNA substrates without sequence specificity in vitro, and both PrgJ derivatives bound pCF 10 in vivo by a mechanism dependent on an intact oriT sequence and cosynthesis of PcfC, PcfF, and PcfG, as shown by a formaldehyde-cross-linking assay. Our findings support a model in which the PcfC receptor coor-dinates with the PrgJ ATPase to drive early steps of pCF 10 processing/transfer: (i) PcfC first binds the pCF 10 relaxosome through contacts with PcfF, PcfG, and DNA; (ii) PcfC delivers the plasmid substrate to PrgJ; and (iii) PrgJ catalyzes substrate transfer to the membrane translocase. Substrate engagement with a VirB 4 -like subunit has not been previously described; conse-quently, our studies point to a novel function for these signature T 4 SS ATPases in mediating early steps of type IV secretion.

40|$|The silent {{phenotype}} {{of human}} butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), present in most human populations in frequencies of approximately 1 / 100, 000, {{is characterized by}} the complete absence of BChE activity or by activity < 10 % of the average levels of the usual phenotype. Heterogeneity in this phenotype has been well established at the phenotypic level, but only a few silent BCHE alleles have been characterized at the DNA level. Twelve silent alleles of the human butyrylcholinesterase gene (BCHE) have been identified in 17 apparently unrelated patients who were selected by their increased sensitivity to the muscle relaxant succinylcholine. All of these alleles are characterized by single nucleotide substitutions or deletions leading to distinct changes {{in the structure of the}} BChE enzyme molecule. Nine of the nucleotide substitutions result in the replacement of single amino acid residues. Three of these variants, BCHE* 33 C, BCHE* 198 G, and BCHE* 201 T, produce normal amounts of immunoreactive but enzymatically inactive BChE protein in the plasma. The other six amino acid substitutions, encoded by BCHE* 37 S, BCHE* 125 F, BCHE* 170 <b>E,</b> BCHE* <b>471</b> R, and BCHE* 518 L, seem to cause reduced expression of BChE protein, and their role in determining the silent phenotype was confirmed by expression in cell culture. The other four silent alleles, BCHE* 271 STOP, BCHE* 500 STOP, BCHE*FS 6, and BCHE*I 2 E 3 - 8 G, encode BChES truncated at their C-terminus because of premature stop codons caused by nucleotide substitutions, a frame shift, or altered splicing. The large number of different silent BCHE alleles found within a relatively small number of patients shows that the heterogeneity of the silent BChE phenotype is high. The characterization of silent BChE variants will be useful in the study of the structure/function relationship for this and other closely related enzymes...|$|R
40|$|The {{sustainable}} {{use of natural}} resources such as game animals requires adjusting extraction to changes in population abundance. Population abundance monitoring is thus necessary to ensure an adaptive management, but this can be difficult {{in the case of}} migratory species where breeding areas are in remote places without local monitoring programs. Predictive models of the winter abundance based in the relation between climate and reproduction success or survival could be a useful alternative to monitoring networks in the breeding areas. In this paper, we evaluate the role of weather variables as indicators of winter abundance estimates. We used Game Abundance Indices (total number of woodcock observed during hunting days, divided by the number of hunting hours), collected by volunteer hunters during 21 seasons, and temperature, rainfall and number of days with snow, calculated in May, June and July in the breeding areas and December to January in the winter areas. The best models explaining variations in winter abundance included number of rainy days in May and June and temperature in July as explanatory variables. All variables were positively correlated with abundance except temperature in July. The predictive quality of the best model based on a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure (i. e. the Pearson correlation coefficient between observed values and LOO-predicted values) was 0. 76. We discuss the applications of this predictive model to develop an adaptive hunting management scheme for the species.

40|$|Woodcock (Scolopax rusticola) {{are heavily}} hunted in south-central Europe {{during the winter}} and have {{been the focus of}} intense {{management}} efforts and concern. One of the significant challenges with this and other migratory gamebirds is that they are typically produced in locations other than those where they are primarily harvested. The delineation of origins of harvested Woodcock is important for the identification of appropriate management strategies. Using analysis of stable hydrogen isotope ratios (δ 2 H) in feathers of juvenile Woodcock harvested in Spain (2007 - 2009, n = 802 individuals), we assigned Woodcock origins using a derived Woodcock feather δ 2 H isoscape and four potential isotopic regions covering the breeding range. We also used a continuous probability surface approach that used the forest cover available throughout the range as a constraint on origins. The majority (90 %) of Woodcock captured in Spain were assigned to origins in central-eastern Europe (488 individuals, 60 %), and the Baltic region (237 individuals, 30 %). These results were similar to those previously obtained for Woodcock taken in France (although the relative importance of both eastern Europe and Baltic regions of origin was the opposite to those harvested in Spain). This means that {{a significant portion of the}} Spanish and French Woodcock bags can be considered as the same management stock, and thus that management of hunter takes in both countries should be coordinated.

The number of individuals (N) was lower at Sidi Salem (36 – 148 ind m- 2) than at Echatt (63 – 272 ind m- 2) in most sampling dates, while the biomass was more variable from one date to another, with no consistent pattern of differences between sites. The condition index (CI), although slightly higher at Sidi Salem than at Echatt, showed at both sites a major increase in March/April, June/July and October, reflecting two main periods of gonads development and {{increase in the level}} of stored reserves {{at the end of the}} reproductive period. Consistently, the recruitment of D. trunculus ran from April to October with a major peak of abundance in spring and a minor one in early fall. The maximum age of D. trunculus was 3 years and the growth rate was highest in the first year. Annual somatic production (P) was lower at Sidi Salem (0. 773 g AFDM m- 2 yr- 1) than at Echatt (1. 262 g AFDM m- 2 yr- 1), possibly reflecting a lower mean annual biomass at Sidi Salem (1. 642 AFDM m- 2) than at Echatt (3. 046 AFDM m- 2), while the annual P/B ratio was similar between the two sites (i. <b>e.</b> 0. <b>471</b> and 0. 414 yr- 1, respectively). Lower N and P at Sidi Salem compared to Echatt are consistent with the proximity of Sidi Salem to the industrial port of Annaba and low hydrodynamic conditions which may favor the accumulation of pollutants, such as hydrocarbons. On the other hand, moderate secondary production of D. trunculus at Echatt compared to other Mediterranean sites may be due to excessive harvesting. We suggest that the low secondary production described in this study should be taken into account for the development of sustainable strategies of clam exploitation in the Gulf of Annaba.

Muscle glucose uptake in vivo (44 %; P < 0. 05) and glycogen synthesis rate (52 %; P < 0. 001) were reduced after 5 h compared with after 3 h of infusion. Despite these changes, there was no decrease in the phosphorylation state of multiple insulin signaling intermediates [insulin receptor, Akt, AS 160 (Akt substrate of 160 kDa), glycogen synthase kinase- 3 β] over the same time course. In isolated soleus strips taken from control or 1 - or 5 -h glucose-infused animals, insulin-stimulated 2 -deoxyglucose transport was similar, but glycogen synthesis was significantly reduced in the 5 -h muscle sample (68 % vs. 1 -h sample; P < 0. 001). These results suggest that the reduced muscle glucose uptake in rats after 5 h of acute hyperglycemia is due more to the metabolic effects of excess glycogen storage than to a defect in insulin signaling or glucose transport...|$|E
40|$|As {{standard}} {{and performance of}} Walk in Stability Chamber (WiSC) at Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM) has been determined from the previous studies, the current research is focused to establish protocol for air change rate (ACH) measurement inside chamber for various experimental studies on designing for human needs. The scopes include the preparation of zone selection, volume of tracer gas, injecting procedure, mixing time, sampling technique and the interval time within sample. All procedures were to follow ASTM Standard <b>E</b> <b>471</b> to ensure the accuracy {{and validity of the}} data collected. Data collection started within three month from December 2007 to February 2008. Air temperature and relative humidity were set at 24 °C and 60 % to 70 % respectively. An automated tracer gas monitor using SF 6 gas as a tracer gas was employed for air change rate measurement. The environmental parameters measured are air temperature, relative humidity, Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) gases using Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) meter. The results were compared to the ASHRAE Standard 62. 1 - 2004, ASHRAE Standard 55 - 2004 and U. S. EPA Standard. From the result, the average air change rate per hour (ACH) in the WiSC was 0. 598 +/- 0. 049 ACH while an average R 2 was 0. 961. The minimum air change rate was 0. 549 ACH while 0. 647 ACH was the maximum. The ventilation rates calculated was 1. 983 L/s per person for 23. 04 m 2 with four occupants. Mean while, the air temperature was in the range of 23. 2 °C to 25. 4 °C and maximum CO 2 and CO gases concentration are 836 ppm and 15. 80 ppm respectively. As a conclusion the ventilation rates inside WiSC was determine. For further study for many types of building, a wide of data collection is needed. Weather changes and type of mechanical ventilation system used has to take into careful attention. The implication of this study is, for next experiment that involving other type of encloses building this method can be carried out with an improvement of the tracer gas method...|$|E

As análises laboratoriais consistiram na determinação da matéria seca (MS), matéria orgânica, matéria mineral, proteína bruta (PB), extrato etéreo, lignina, fibra em detergente neutro (FDN), FDN corrigida para cinzas e proteína, fibra em detergente ácido (FDA), proteína insolúvel em detergente neutro, proteína insolúvel em detergente ácido e proteína solúvel em detergente neutro. Os nutrientes digestíveis totais (NDT) foram calculados por intermédio da composição química. As frações B 2, C e a taxa de digestão da fibra, bem como a repleção ruminal, foram estimadas através de parâmetros cinéticos obtidos a partir da incubação in situ. O avanço da idade de corte propiciou aumento nos teores de MS em 9, 5 %. As variedades intermediárias apresentaram NDT {{superior}}es às precoces, as quais destacaram-se pelos mais elevados teores de FDN e FDA, cujos respectivos valores foram 487, 56 <b>e</b> <b>471,</b> 03, e 287, 87 e 247, 54 g/kg MS para as variedades precoces e intermediárias, respectivamente. O NDT aumentou linearmente com a idade de corte, variando de 62, 45 a 63, 50 %; contudo, os teores de FDN e FDA apresentaram comportamento quadrático. As variedades precoces apresentaram maior teor de PB que as intermediárias somente na idade ao corte de 549 dias, contrariamente, o teor de brix foi superior para as variedades intermediárias no último corte. As variedades precoces apresentaram maior repleção ruminal total e menor taxa de digestão da fibra. A fração B 2 da fibra, foi reduzida e a C foi linearmente aumentada com a idade das plantas. The {{objectives of}} this work were to determine the chemical composition, the potentialy degradable fraction of NDF (B 2) and undegradable fraction (C) and to estimate the ruminal fill of sugar cane with different cycles of production (early and intermediate), in three cut times (426, 487 and 549 days). The laboratorial analysis consisted in dry matter (DM), organic matter, ash, crude protein (CP), ether extract, lignin, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), neutral detergent fiber corrected for ash and protein, acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent insoluble protein, acid detergent insoluble protein and neutral detergent protein soluble. The TDN was calculated by chemical composition. The degradable and undegradable fractions, and fiber digestion rate, {{as well as the}} ruminal fill were estimated by kinetic parameters obtained throught in situ incubation. The advanced cut time increased the DM in 9. 5 %. The intermediate varieties presented higher TDN than early varieties, which had the highest contents of NDF and ADF, whose respective values were 487. 56 and 471. 03, and 287. 87 and 247, 54 g/kg DM for the early and intermediate varieties, respectively. The TDN increased linearly with the cut time, varying from 62. 45 to 63. 50 %; however the NDF and ADF contents presented quadratic behavior. The early varieties presented higher content of CP than the intermediate only in the cut time of 549 days; contrarily, the brix of the sugar cane was superior to the intermediate varieties in the last cut. The early varieties presented larger total ruminal fill and lower fiber digestion rate. The degradable fraction of the fiber was reduced and the undegradable fraction was linearly increased with the age of the plants...|$|E
40|$|The membrane-integral {{transcriptional}} activator CadC comprises sensory and transcriptional regulatory functions {{within one}} polypeptide chain. Its C-terminal periplasmic domain, CadCpd, {{is responsible for}} sensing of environmental pH {{as well as for}} binding of the feedback inhibitor cadaverine. Here we describe the crystal structure of CadCpd (residues 188 – 512) solved at a resolution of 1. 8 Å via multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) using a ReCl 62 − derivative. CadCpd reveals a novel fold comprising two subdomains: an N-terminal subdomain dominated by a β-sheet in contact with three α-helices and a C-terminal subdomain formed by an eleven-membered α-helical bundle, which is oriented almost perpendicular to the helices in the first subdomain. Further to the native protein, crystal structures were also solved for its variants D 471 N and D <b>471</b> <b>E,</b> which show functionally different behavior in pH sensing. Interestingly, in the heavy metal derivative of CadCpd used for MAD phasing a ReCl 62 − ion was found in a cavity located between the two subdomains. Amino acid side chains that coordinate this complex ion are conserved in CadC homologues from various bacterial species, suggesting a function of the cavity in the binding of cadaverine, which was supported by docking studies. Notably, CadCpd forms a homo-dimer in solution, which can be explained by an extended, albeit rather polar interface between two symmetry-related monomers in the crystal structure. The occurrence of several acidic residues in this region suggests protonation-dependent changes in the mode of dimerization, which could eventually trigger transcriptional activation by CadC in the bacterial cytoplasm...|$|R
40|$|HCN {{channels}} {{are thought to}} be structurally similar to Kv channels, but show much lower selectivity for K +. The, 3. 3 Å selectivity filter of K+ channels is formed by the pore-lining sequence XT(V/I) GYG, with X usually T, and is held stable by key residues in the P-loop. Differences in the P-loop sequence of HCN channels (eg. the pore-lining sequence L 478 C 479 IGYG) suggest these residues could account for differences in selectivity between these channel families. Despite being expressed, L 478 T/C 479 T HCN 4 channels did not produce current. Since threonine in the second position is highly conserved in K+ channels, we also studied C 479 T channels. Based on permeability ratios (PX/PK), C 479 T HCN 4 channels (K+(1). Rb+(0. 85). Cs+(0. 59). Li+(0. 50) $Na+(0. 49)) were less selective than WT rabbit HCN 4 (K+(1). Rb+(0. 48). Cs+(0. 31) $ Na+(0. 29). Li+(0. 03)), indicating that the TIGYG sequence is insufficient to confer K+ selectivity to HCN channels. C 479 T HCN 4 channels had an increased permeability to large organic cations than WT HCN 4 channels, as well as increased unitary K+ conductance, and altered channel gating. Collectively, these results suggest that HCN 4 channels have larger pores than K+ channels and replacement of the cysteine at position 479 with threonine further increases pore size. Furthermore, selected mutations in other regions linked previously to pore stability in K+ channels (ie. S 475 D, S 475 <b>E</b> and F <b>471</b> W/K 472 W) were also unable to confer K+ selectivity to C 479 T HCN 4 channels. Our findings establish the presence of the TIGYG pore-linin...|$|R

40|$|Enterobacteria in fecal flora {{are often}} {{reported}} to be highly resistant. Escherichia coli is the main species; resistance data on other species are rare. To assess {{the effect of the}} host's environment, antimicrobial resistance was determined in fecal species of the family Enterobacteriaceae from three populations: healthy people (HP) (n = 125) with no exposure to antimicrobials for 3 months preceding sampling, university hospital patients (UP) (n = 159) from wards where the antibiotic use was 112 defined daily doses (DDD) /bed/month, and geriatric long-term patients (LTP) (n = 74) who used 1. 8 DDD/bed/month. The mean length of hospital stay was 5 days for the UP and 22 months for the LTP. The isolates were identified to at least genus level, and MICs of 16 antimicrobials were determined. From the university hospital, resistance data on clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates were also collected. Resistance data for on average two different isolates per sample (range, 1 to 5) were analyzed: <b>471</b> <b>E.</b> coli isolates and 261 other Enterobacteriaceae spp. Resistance was mainly found among E. coli; even in HP, 18 % of E. coli isolates were resistant to two or more antimicrobial groups, with MIC patterns indicative of transferable resistance. Other fecal enterobacteria were generally susceptible, with little typically transferable multiresistance. Clinical Klebsiella and Enterobacter isolates were significantly more resistant than fecal isolates. The resistance patterns at both hospitals mirrored the patterns of antibiotic use, but LTP E. coli isolates were significantly more resistant than those from UP. Conditions permitting an efficient spread may have been more important in sustaining high resistance levels in the LTP. E. coli was the main carrier of antimicrobial resistance in fecal flora; resistance in other species was rare in the absence of antimicrobial selection...|$|R
40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (Mtb), a pathogenic bacterium, is the causative {{agent in}} the vast majority of human tuberculosis (TB) cases. Nearly one-third of the world’s population has been affected by TB and annually two million deaths result from the disease. Because of the high cost of medication for a long term treatment with multiple drugs and the increase of multidrug-resistant Mtb strains, faster-acting drugs and more effective vaccines are urgently demanded. Several metabolic pathways of Mtb are attractive for identifying novel drug targets against TB. Hence, a high quality genome-scale metabolic network of Mtb (HQMtb) was reconstructed to investigate its whole metabolism and explore for new drug targets. The HQMtb metabolic network was constructed using an unbiased approach by extracting gene annotation information from various databases and consolidating the data with information from literature. The HQMtb consists of 686 genes, 607 intracellular reactions, 734 metabolites and <b>471</b> <b>E.</b> C. numbers, 27 of which are incomplete. The HQMtb was compared with two recently published Mtb metabolic models, GSMN-TB by Beste et al. and iNJ 661 model by Jamshidi and Palsson. Due to the different reconstruction methods used, the three models have different characteristics. The 68 new genes and 80 new E. C. numbers were found only in the HQMtb and resulting in approximately 52 new metabolic reactions located in various metabolic pathways, for example biosynthesis of steroid, fatty acid metabolism, and TCA cycle. Through a comparison of HQMtb with a previously published human metabolic network (EHMN) in terms of protein signatures, 42 Mtb metabolic genes were proposed as new drug targets based on two criteria: (a) their protein functional sites do not match with any human protein functional sites; (b) they are essential genes. Interestingly, 13 of them are found in a list of current validated drug targets. Among all proposed drug targets, Rv 0189 c, Rv 3001 c and Rv 3607 c are of interest to be tested in the laboratory because they were also proposed as drug target candidates from two research groups using different methods.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{trends in}} breastfeeding indicators {{in the city}} of Feira de Santana, Brazil, and to identify population characteristics that might have influenced this trend. MethodsThree methodologically comparable cross‐sectional surveys performed in 1996, 2001, and 2009 were analyzed. These involved 2, 159, 2, 319, and 1, 471 children younger than 1 year of age who were vaccinated in national multivaccination campaigns in the respective years. A standardized questionnaire was used, containing closed questions on consumption of breast milk and other foods on the day before the survey, along with questions regarding the characteristics of the population. ResultsThe annual growth of the breastfeeding indicators was 2. 1 % for breastfeeding in the first hour of life (from 52. 2 % to 68. 9 %); 1. 1 % for breastfeeding among children aged 9 to 12 months (from 45 % to 59. 6 %); and 0. 8 % for exclusive breastfeeding among infants younger than 6 months (from 36. 9 % to 47. 4 %). The median duration of exclusive breastfeeding increased from 52. 3 to 84. 3 days, and overall breastfeeding from 278 to 376 days. Some changes in the characteristics of the population were observed, which may have positively influenced the evolution of the breastfeeding indicators (better schooling level among the mothers, less use of dummies/pacifiers, and lower proportions of adolescent mothers), or negatively (greater proportions of primiparous mothers and cesarean deliveries, and lower frequency of births in Baby‐Friendly Hospitals). ConclusionThere were significant advances in breastfeeding indicators, although they are still far from ideal. Changes observed in population characteristics may have positively or negatively influenced this evolution. ResumoObjetivoVerificar a tendência dos indicadores de aleitamento materno (AM) em Feira de Santana, Brasil, e identificar características da população que possam ter influenciado essa tendência.

Foram pesados e fixados os ovários e hepatopâncreas, realizando um controle histológico nos 4; 9; 15; 20; 40 e 50 dias. O índice gonadossomático variou entre 0, 925 e 3, 747 (controle) e entre 1, 457 e 5, 035 (ablacionados). Determinou-se valores de índice hepatopancreático entre 2, 059 a 4, 520 (controle) <b>e</b> de 3, <b>471</b> a 4, 471 (ablacionados). A duração média da intermuda foi 21, 7 :j: 3, 9 e 23, 2 :j: 2, 4 dias para o grupo controle e ablacionados, respectivamente. Ao finalizar o experimento a análise histológica demostrou que os ovários das femeas ablacionadas encontravam-se totalmente amadurecidos e os do controle em vitelogênese primária. Conclui-se que a ablação peduncular acelera a maturação ovariana de P. muelleri, sem modificar a freqüência da muda. O índice ovariano é independente do tamanho no intervalo de peso estudado e a ablação não apresentou efeito sobre o peso relativo dos hepatopâncreas. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the ovary development of ablated and non-ablated females of Pleoticus muelleri and to evaluate the influence of eyestalk ablation on molting frequency. The females (7 - 22 g weight) were maintained under culture conditions with 12 : 12 fotoperiod, 15 - 17 ÂºC temperature and 31 % 0 salinity. They were fed on fresh squid, prawn and clam. The ovaries and digestive glands were weighed and fixed for histological examination at 4, 9, 15, 20, 40, and 50 days. Gonad index varied between 0. 925 and 3. 747 (control) and 1. 457 and 5. 035 (ablated). The digestive gland index ranged from 2. 059 to 4. 520 (control) and 3. 471 to 4. 471 (ablated).

At the end of the experiment the ovaries of ablated females were mature and those of the control were in primary vitellogenesis. It was concluded that the eyestalk ablation in P. muelleri resulted in precocious maturation of the ovary without changes in the molting frequency. The ovary index was size-independent.

Os maiores valores de nitrogênio ingerido, absorvido e retido, de 32, 6; 20, 5 e 13, 7 g/dia, respectivamente, foram observados com o fornecimento das dietas com 40 % de volumoso. O tipo de volumoso influencia mais a digestibilidade dos nutrientes que sua proporção na dieta. Thirty-two non {{castrated}} Ile de France lambs fed {{corn silage}} or sugar-cane based diets with two roughage:concentrate ratios (60 : 40 or 40 : 60) were used. The animals were kept individually confined with {{control of the}} supplied food and leftovers, weekly weighted for determination of the daily weight gain and food conversion. Simultaneously, it was carried out digestibility and metabolism trials to determine the nutrient intake and digestibility and nitrogen balance of the experiment diets. The weight gain (294. 6 g/day) was higher for the lambs fed corn silage, and regarding to roughage:concentrate 40 : 60 it was 314. 3 g/day. The ratio roughage:concentrate only influenced the consume of digestible fiber in neutral detergent (NDF) and fiber in acid detergent (FAD) in which the highest values, 125. 26 and 48. 97 g/day obtained with the ratio roughage:concentrate 60 : 40. The lambs fed corn silage showed a higher intake of all digestible nutrients, except for crude protein (162. 00 g/day) and non fibrous carbohydrates (471. 42 g/day).
