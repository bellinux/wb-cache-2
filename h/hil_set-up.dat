40|$|Advanced {{testing methods}} are {{becoming}} more and more prevalent to increase the reliability of wind turbines. In this field, dynamometers that allow for system level tests of full-scale nacelles will play an important role. Operating these test benches in a hardware-in-the-loop (<b>HiL)</b> <b>set-up</b> that emulates realistic drive train modes is challenging because of the relatively low stiffness of the load machinesâ€™ drive trains. This paper proposes a control method for enabling the said operation mode. It is based on the idea that the HiL-controller overrides the present unrealistic dynamics and directly imposes desired realistic dynamics on the test bench. A solution for the control problem is given and applied in a design study with a generic wind turbine and a test bench model obtained from construction data of a real test bench. In the design study, the HiL-controller robustly imposes desired drive train dynamics on the test bench model. Despite measurement noise, unmodelled parametric uncertainty, and unmodelled delays, the first drive train mode is correctly reproduced. This is confirmed by a comparison with simulation results from a full servo-aero-elastic code. Furthermore, an implementation of the test bench model on a programmable logic controller showed the real-time feasibility of the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{interaction}} between pantograph and overhead line (OHL) heavily influences {{the quality of}} the current collection that, on one side assures the correct power transmission from the contact wire to the electrical traction drives of the vehicle, {{and on the other side}} affects the amount of wear of both the contact wire of the OHL and the collector strips of the pantograph. Moreover the dynamics of pantograph-catenary coupled system is a mandatory topic when considering the interoperability issues, among which there is the requirement of the assessment of the quality of interaction between a pantograph running on a catenary belonging to a network different from its original one. Usually a pantograph is optimised and set-up for a given category of OHL, but it is not assured that running under different catenaries allows to obtain the same performances. To this purpose the key option is to perform test runs. Nevertheless an analysis before test trials would be very useful for a first evaluation of a new pantograph-OHL combination, enabling to save time and cost of the experimental runs. A first possibility, nowadays widely used especially in the design stage of new catenaries, is to perform numerical simulations by means of a validated numerical model, e. g. according to EN 50318. As an auxiliary option, a hardware in the loop (HIL) indoor set-up can be used in order to analyse the dynamic behaviour of a real pantograph coupled with a overhead line (OHL), virtually simulated in real time. This work focuses on the analysis of the correspondences between indoor test carried out on a pantograph, and the results that are obtained during test runs on the real line. The laboratory tests are fundamentally of two types: classical sinusoidal tests (step sine or sweep sine) and tests with <b>HIL</b> <b>set-up.</b> The results of both approaches are compared with on track test results considering the influence pantograph mean contact force and contact wire mechanical tension. The potentialities of HIL approach as a useful tool for an effective application of the virtual homologation concept are pointed out...|$|E
40|$|Accurate time {{synchronization}} of Phasor Measurement Unit (PMUs) play {{an important}} role in application of synchrophasor technology. Dierent time distribution methods are present which are capable of synchronizing Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) with dierent timing accuracies. Initial part of this report presents information about some of the high-accuracy time distribution methods which were studied and evaluated based on their usability for synchrophasor applications. Later part of the report assesses timing requirements for PMUs by carrying out tests in a controlled experimental environment. In the past, generally PMUs were tested using a stand-alone relay test kit. A major drawback of this type of testing set-up is that it does not tests the PMUs in their practical operational environment which includes an instrumentation channel feeding input signals to the PMU. Overcoming this drawback, a new generic real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop (<b>HIL)</b> test <b>set-up</b> has been used to assess timing requirements of commercial PMUs in the laboratory. The results obtained showcase the eect of instrumentation channel on phase errors and also in determining timing requirements of PMUs. Insightful information showcasing the behaviour of PMU estimates in case of jitters in timing signals has also been presented...|$|R
40|$|Hydrostatic {{transmissions}} are extensively used {{in heavy}} duty vehicles {{due to their}} high power density characteristics. Hydraulic hybrid transmissions are promising options for energy saving transmission systems in automotive applications. The task {{of this research is}} to investigate hydraulic hybrid transmission based on power split principle for energy saving potential by developing, modeling and analyzing hybrid Output Coupled Power Split Drive (OCPSD) configurations and comparative assessment with full series hybrid transmission. The sizing of two OCPSD-Hybrid configurations and a full series hybrid configuration are illustrated for class- 6 delivery truck application. Energy recovery system is designed to capture braking energy by using hydraulic accumulators. Models of OCPSD-Hybrid and full series hybrid configurations are developed using PSDD software tool. A comparative assessment of both the concepts for sample local delivery and highway cycle shows a good fuel saving potentials by OCPSD-Hybrid transmission. Also, there is a scope for reducing the fuel consumption by applying optimal engine management. A test <b>set-up</b> with Hardware-in-the-loop (<b>HiL)</b> principle to verify the energy consumption and validation of various advanced control strategies of OCPSD hybrid transmission is proposed.

40|$|A {{hardware-in-the-loop}} (HIL) simulation is {{a hybrid}} simulation {{that includes a}} hardware element within a numerical simulation loop. One {{of the goals of}} performing a HIL simulation at the European Proximity Operation Simulator (EPOS) is to simulate on-orbit servicing for verification and validation of the docking phase. The simulator essentially consists of two robots, with very accurate position controllers, holding a docking interface and a probe element, respectively. A key feature of the <b>HIL</b> docking simulator <b>set-up</b> is a feedback loop that is closed on the real force sensed at the docking interface during the contact with the probe, which is used in order to drive the free-floating bodies numerical simulation. The high stiffness of the robots causes the contact duration to be shorter than the (incompressible) time delay in the robots' dynamics. This leads to inconsistencies in the HIL docking simulation results and to potential instability and damage of the closed-loop system. This work presents a novel mitigation strategy to the given challenge, accompanied with stability analysis and validating experiments. The high-stiffness compliance issue is modified by combining virtual and real compliances in the software and hardware. The method is presented here for six degrees of freedom. Experimental results for the case of a translational motion along a single axis and the six degrees of freedom are presented, too. In addition, analysis is performed in order to characterize the stability region of the HIL docking simulator {{as a function of the}} contact force parameters, the time delay and the simulated satellites' masses. This hybrid contact dynamics model and the accompanying analysis is envisioned to provide a safe and flexible docking simulator tool. This tool shall allow reproduction of the desired impact dynamics for any stiffness and damping characteristics within the stability region...|$|R
40|$|Recently CNH {{developed}} {{a new series of}} wheel excavators equipped with a Electronic Control Unit (ECU) that use a new control software. It was critical to test and validate the design of this new control system before deployment to ensure high customer satisfaction and reducing warranty costs. Test on a Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) platform accelerates the verification and validation process. A validated <b>HIL</b> <b>set-up,</b> being a repeatable and reliable test platform with a short turnaround time is ideal for developing standardized processes for ECU testing and calibration. The goal {{of this paper is to}} show the development of the wheel excavator model for HIL application. In particular the model of the hydraulic circuit and the mechanical system of the wheel excavator arm are reported. An analytical model of the hydraulic system includes orifice flow equations, fluid compressibility equations for all the oil volumes, as well as the force balance equations for all the cylinders. In order to describe the motion of the excavator arm both kinematic and dynamic models were developed from the fundamental theory for robotic manipulators [1]. The kinematic model is derived following the Denavit-Hartenberg guidelines while the dynamic model is created by writing Newton- Euler equations for each link of the arm. By combining the equations, a dynamical model in terms of the joint variables is obtained. The mathematical model have many nonlinearities because of nonlinear opening characteristics and dead zone of main control valves, geometrical relationship in the kinematic model, frictions, ecc. These aspects make modeling very complex. The model has been built in a modular approach so that model updates due to a modification of the system configurations could be performed starting from available model, by single component specifications, thereby reducing the total effort for the new models. The model must have same specific property due to the HIL application; the first of all is that the model must run in real time. A second general target is that the developed model easily fit into the available simulation models environment for HIL closed-loop simulation, in particular it must turn employing maximum 15 % of resources at fixed time step 1 ms and with one of the following numerical integrators typologies: ODE 1 to ODE 4. Simulation results referred to some maneuvers have been compared with acquisitio...|$|E
40|$|The European Proximity Operation Simulator (EPOS) is a {{hardware-in-the-loop}} (HIL) system aiming, among other objectives, at emulating on-orbit docking of spacecraft for verification and {{validation of the}} docking phase. This <b>HIL</b> docking simulator <b>set-up</b> essentially consists of docking interfaces, simulating the servicing satellite called chaser satellite, the serviced satellite called target satellite, a sensor of the forces and torques during contact, and two industrial robots that hold the docking interfaces, and control satellites motion relative position and attitude. Furthermore, the EPOS includes a real-time controller interface linked to a computer-based numerical simulator of satellites orbital and attitude dynamics. A key feature of this set-up is the feedback loop that is closed on the real force sensed at the docking interfaces during contact. That feedback force is used as driving input to satellites dynamics numerical simulation. This HIL docking simulation concept has the unique advantage of using the measured contact forces and torques, but it presents significant challenges. The high stiffness of the industrial robots and the docking interfaces yields a high bandwidth contact dynamics at impact and, thus, very short contact time durations. These times might be shorter than the inherent time delay of the robot controllers. This leads to physical inconsistency in the docking dynamics and measured variables. This also causes a stability issue in the force feedback HIL system during contact and may cause catastrophic damages to the robots. Additional problems {{that need to be}} addressed are the characterization of the stability domain of operation, the compensation of the non-contact forces and torques, such as the measured forces and torques due to gravity effect. Finally, this thesis addresses the task of identifying the dynamic behavior of the robot end-effectors. This thesis addresses the above mentioned challenges and problems and presents solutions towards a stable and safe docking simulation operation of the EPOS facility. First, in order to mitigate the high stiffness and time delay problem, the thesis introduces a novel idea of simulating contact based on a concept called hybrid contact dynamics model. The method, developed in this thesis, is based on a combination of a passive compliance control introduced at the end-effector of the robot and a virtual contact model. The virtual contact model allows the operator to vary the contact parameters which can also be used as a control gain. The method also allows to solve the stability problem coming from the combination of time delay of the robot controller and high stiffness of the robot end-effector. For the passive compliance control, a new device is designed that has fairly known stiffness properties which are softer than the robot and docking interface stiffness. Second, the thesis presents a stability analysis of the proposed method via the adaptation of the pole location method to dead-time systems. The analysis is based on a linearized design model of the dynamics; linearization is performed around the docking geometrical configuration. This work first presents an analysis for the single dimensional case, which is then extended to two dimensions. The highlight of the stability analysis is the development of physically intuitive state-space model that easily unveil the modes of the contact dynamics. The application of the pole location method to the resulting second-order characteristics polynomial is straight forward. The contribution of this analysis is a closed-form relationship, and associated plots, among the system's parameter, i. e., the satellite's masses, the stiffness and damping coefficient of the contact parameters, the delay, and the geometry. In addition, the stability analysis is supported using the passivity method which is valid for three dimensions. Third, a model of the force-torque sensor is presented, and the classical weighted least-squares estimation technique is suggested for the identification and compensation of the non-contact forces and torques from the contact force and the torque measurement. Finally, it is proposed to utilize a LEICA laser tracker, a positioning measurement system, in order to identify the robot end-effectors dynamics behaviors such as the natural frequency and damping ratio. This hybrid contact dynamics model and the accompanying analysis is envisioned as a tool for safe and flexible EPOS operations. This tool shall allow emulation of the desired impact dynamics for any stiffness and damping characteristics within the stability region without recurring to a modification of the hardware. The experimental results of the robotics based hybrid docking simulator comply with experimental data from an air-bearing testbed that was independently performed by this author at the Space Robotics Laboratory of Tohoku University. It demonstrates the validity of the novel EPOS concept of operations and increases the confidence of using this approach for future on-orbit docking/contact algorithm validation, at the EPOS facility.
