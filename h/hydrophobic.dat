5|$|A {{compound}} that has two immiscible hydrophilic and <b>hydrophobic</b> parts {{within the same}} molecule is called an amphiphilic molecule. Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and <b>hydrophobic</b> part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.|$|E
5|$|By {{fine-tuning}} {{the surface}} roughness, {{it is possible}} to achieve a transition between both superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic regions. Generally, the rougher the surface, the more <b>hydrophobic</b> it is.|$|E
5|$|Krypton-83 has {{application}} in {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) for imaging airways. In particular, it enables the radiologist to distinguish between <b>hydrophobic</b> and hydrophilic surfaces containing an airway.|$|E
5|$|New {{materials}} {{may make}} even better collectors. One such material {{is inspired by}} the Namib Desert beetle, which survives only on the moisture it extracts from the atmosphere. It {{has been found that}} its back is coated with microscopic projections: the peaks are hydrophilic and the troughs are <b>hydrophobic.</b> Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have emulated this capability by creating a textured surface that combines alternating <b>hydrophobic</b> and hydrophilic materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{variation}} in titration curves when the amino acids can be grouped by category. With {{the exception of}} tyrosine, using titration to distinguish among <b>hydrophobic</b> amino acids is problematic.|$|E
5|$|Because of the xenon atom's large, {{flexible}} outer electron shell, the NMR spectrum {{changes in}} response to surrounding conditions {{and can be used}} to monitor the surrounding chemical circumstances. For instance, xenon dissolved in water, xenon dissolved in <b>hydrophobic</b> solvent, and xenon associated with certain proteins can be distinguished by NMR.|$|E
5|$|Carboxypeptidase cleaves peptide {{linkages}} during digestion of proteins. A coordinate {{covalent bond}} is formed between the terminal peptide and a C=O group attached to zinc, {{which gives the}} carbon a positive charge. This helps to create a <b>hydrophobic</b> pocket on the enzyme near the zinc, which attracts the non-polar part of the protein being digested.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds are {{naturally}} lipophilic and <b>hydrophobic,</b> {{which means the}} diamonds' surface cannot be wet by water, but can be easily wet and stuck by oil. This property can be utilized to extract diamonds using oil when making synthetic diamonds. However, when diamond surfaces are chemically modified with certain ions, {{they are expected to}} become so hydrophilic that they can stabilize multiple layers of water ice at human body temperature.|$|E
5|$|Linus Pauling is {{credited}} with the successful prediction of regular protein secondary structures based on hydrogen bonding, an idea first put forth by William Astbury in 1933. Later work by Walter Kauzmann on denaturation, based partly on previous studies by Kaj Linderstrøm-Lang, contributed an understanding of protein folding and structure mediated by <b>hydrophobic</b> interactions.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{undergo a}} range of posttranslational modifications, when additional chemical groups {{are attached to the}} amino acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce <b>hydrophobic</b> lipoproteins, or hydrophilic glycoproteins. These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid palmitic acid to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes.|$|E
5|$|Next to the {{hydrated}} {{region is}} an intermediate region {{that is only}} partially hydrated. This boundary layer is approximately 0.3nm thick. Within this short distance, the water concentration drops from 2M on the headgroup side to nearly zero on the tail (core) side. The <b>hydrophobic</b> core of the bilayer is typically 3-4nm thick, but this value varies with chain length and chemistry. Core thickness also varies significantly with temperature, in particular near a phase transition.|$|E
5|$|Reversible inhibitors {{attach to}} enzymes with non-covalent {{interactions}} such as hydrogen bonds, <b>hydrophobic</b> interactions and ionic bonds. Multiple weak bonds between the inhibitor and the active site combine to produce strong and specific binding. In contrast to substrates and irreversible inhibitors, reversible inhibitors {{generally do not}} undergo chemical reactions when bound to the enzyme and can be easily removed by dilution or dialysis.|$|E
5|$|Several coleopteran adaptations have {{attracted}} interest in biomimetics with possible commercial applications. The bombardier beetle's powerful repellent spray has inspired {{the development of}} a fine mist spray technology, claimed to have a low carbon impact compared to aerosol sprays. Moisture harvesting behavior by the Namib desert beetle (Stenocara gracilipes) has inspired a self-filling water bottle which utilises hydrophilic and <b>hydrophobic</b> materials to benefit people living in dry regions with no regular rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Some {{compounds}} {{have been}} identified to bind cNTnC with low affinity and act as troponin activators: DFBP-O (a structural analog of levosimendan), 4-(4-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)-3-pyridinamine (NCI147866), and bepridil. The calmodulin antagonist, W7, has also been found to bind to cNTnC {{to act as a}} troponin inhibitor. All of these compounds bind to the <b>hydrophobic</b> patch in the open conformation of cNTnC, with troponin activators promoting interaction with the cTnI switch peptide and troponin inhibitors destabilizing the interaction.|$|E
5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} encoded {{directly}} by the genetic code {{can be divided into}} several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, size, and functional groups. These properties are important for protein structure and protein–protein interactions. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their <b>hydrophobic</b> residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried {{in the middle of the}} protein, whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent. (Note that in biochemistry, a residue refers to a specific monomer within the polymeric chain of a polysaccharide, protein or nucleic acid.) The integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings of exposed <b>hydrophobic</b> amino acids that anchor them into the lipid bilayer. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of <b>hydrophobic</b> amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. In similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like glutamate and aspartate, while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like lysine and arginine. There are different hydrophobicity scales of amino acid residues.|$|E
5|$|The fogstand beetle of the Namib Desert, Stenocara gracilipes, is able {{to collect}} water from fog, as its elytra have a {{textured}} surface combining hydrophilic (water-loving) bumps and waxy, <b>hydrophobic</b> troughs. The beetle faces the early morning breeze, holding up its abdomen; droplets condense on the elytra and run along ridges towards their mouthparts. Similar adaptations are found in several other Namib desert beetles such as Onymacris unguicularis.|$|E
5|$|Toxins of type I {{systems are}} small, <b>hydrophobic</b> {{proteins}} that confer toxicity by damaging cell membranes. Few intracellular targets of type I toxins have been identified, possibly {{due to the}} difficult nature of analysing proteins that are poisonous to their bacterial hosts.|$|E
5|$|Antibody and antigen {{interact}} by spatial complementarity (lock and key). The molecular forces {{involved in}} the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and non-specific – for example electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonds, <b>hydrophobic</b> interactions, and van der Waals forces. This means binding between antibody and antigen is reversible, and the antibody's affinity towards an antigen is relative rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding also means {{it is possible for}} an antibody to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.|$|E
5|$|Transmembrane {{proteins}} {{can also}} serve as ligand transport proteins that alter the permeability of the cell membrane to small molecules and ions. The membrane alone has a <b>hydrophobic</b> core through which polar or charged molecules cannot diffuse. Membrane proteins contain internal channels that allow such molecules to enter and exit the cell. Many ion channel proteins are specialized to select for only a particular ion; for example, potassium and sodium channels often discriminate for {{only one of the}} two ions.|$|E
25|$|Aerogels by {{themselves}} are hydrophilic, but chemical treatment {{can make them}} <b>hydrophobic.</b> If they absorb moisture they usually suffer a structural change, such as contraction, and deteriorate, but degradation can be prevented by making them <b>hydrophobic.</b> Aerogels with <b>hydrophobic</b> interiors are less susceptible to degradation than aerogels with only an outer <b>hydrophobic</b> layer, even if a crack penetrates the surface.|$|E
25|$|Acrylic paint {{essentially}} {{consists of}} PMMA suspended in water; however since PMMA is <b>hydrophobic,</b> a substance with both <b>hydrophobic</b> and hydrophilic groups {{needs to be}} added to facilitate the suspension.|$|E
25|$|The {{core protein}} has 191 amino acids {{and can be}} divided into three domains on the basis of hydrophobicity: domain 1 (residues 1–117) {{contains}} mainly basic residues with two short <b>hydrophobic</b> regions; domain 2 (residues 118–174) is less basic and more <b>hydrophobic</b> and its C-terminus {{is at the end of}} p21; domain 3 (residues 175–191) is highly <b>hydrophobic</b> and acts as a signal sequence for E1 envelope protein.|$|E
25|$|Cysteine has {{traditionally}} been {{considered to be a}} hydrophilic amino acid, based largely on the chemical parallel between its thiol group and the hydroxyl groups in the side-chains of other polar amino acids. However, the cysteine side chain has been shown to stabilize <b>hydrophobic</b> interactions in micelles to a greater degree than the side chain in the non-polar amino acid glycine and the polar amino acid serine. In a statistical analysis of the frequency with which amino acids appear in different chemical environments in the structures of proteins, free cysteine residues were found to associate with <b>hydrophobic</b> regions of proteins. Their <b>hydrophobic</b> tendency was equivalent to that of known non-polar amino acids such as methionine and tyrosine (tyrosine is polar aromatic but also <b>hydrophobic),</b> those of which were much greater than that of known polar amino acids such as serine and threonine. Hydrophobicity scales, which rank amino acids from most <b>hydrophobic</b> to most hydrophilic, consistently place cysteine towards the <b>hydrophobic</b> end of the spectrum, even when they are based on methods that are not influenced by the tendency of cysteines to form disulfide bonds in proteins. Therefore, cysteine is now often grouped among the <b>hydrophobic</b> amino acids, though it is sometimes also classified as slightly polar, or polar.|$|E
25|$|Models like PB and GB allow {{estimation}} of the mean electrostatic free energy but do {{not account for the}} (mostly) entropic effects arising from solute-imposed constraints on the organization of the water or solvent molecules. This is termed the <b>hydrophobic</b> effect and is {{a major factor in the}} folding process of globular proteins with <b>hydrophobic</b> cores. Implicit solvation models may be augmented with a term that accounts for the <b>hydrophobic</b> effect. The most popular way to do this is by taking the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) as a proxy of the extent of the <b>hydrophobic</b> effect. Most authors place the extent of this effect between 5 and 45 cal/(Å2 mol). Note that this surface area pertains to the solute, while the <b>hydrophobic</b> effect is mostly entropic in nature at physiological temperatures and occurs on the side of the solvent.|$|E
25|$|In particular, peptide {{side chain}} P6-Glu {{contacts}} {{a network of}} three hydrogen bonds; P5-Asn points into the solvent, making no specific interactions (hence the absence of substrate consensus at this position); P4-Leu is buried in a <b>hydrophobic</b> pocket; P3-Tyr is held in a <b>hydrophobic</b> pocket with a short hydrogen bond at the end; P2-Phe is also surrounded by hydrophobes including {{the face of the}} triad histidine; P1-Gln forms four hydrogen bonds; and P1’-Ser is only partly enclosed in a shallow <b>hydrophobic</b> groove.|$|E
25|$|In {{the drug}} {{discovery}} process of a 5-HT2C agonist, a pharmacophore module {{has been used}} to discover novel 5-HT2C receptor ligands. The pharmacophore has four features; one aromatic ring, two <b>hydrophobic</b> features and one positive ionizable feature. Figure 4 shows an example of a compound that fits the agonist pharmacophore perfectly. The nitrogen atom of piperazine fits the positive ionizable feature, the benzofuran part fits the aromatic ring and one <b>hydrophobic,</b> and the trifluoromethane part fits another <b>hydrophobic</b> feature of the pharmacophore.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa has {{the ability}} to metabolise a variety of substrates including n-alkanes, hexadecane and oils. Uptake of these <b>hydrophobic</b> substrates is speculated to rely on the production of rhamnolipids. It is thought that rhamnolipids either cause the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell surface to become <b>hydrophobic,</b> promoting an interaction between the substrate and the cell, or secreted rhamnolipids emulsify the substrate and allow it to be taken up by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell. There is evidence that rhamnolipids are highly adsorbent to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell surface, causing it to become <b>hydrophobic.</b> It has also been shown that production of rhamnolipids promotes uptake of hexadecane by overcoming the inhibitory effect of the hydrophilic interactions caused by LPS. Production of rhamnolipids is observed on <b>hydrophobic</b> substrates but equally high yields are achievable on other carbon sources such as sugars. Furthermore, although mono-rhamnolipids have been shown to interact with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell membrane and cause it to become <b>hydrophobic,</b> di-rhamnolipids do not interact well with the cell membrane because the polar head group is too large to penetrate the LPS layer. Therefore, although Rhamnolipids may play a part in interaction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with <b>hydrophobic</b> carbon sources, they are likely to have additional functions.|$|E
25|$|Either {{circular}} {{style of}} diagram {{can provide an}} intuitive and easily visualizable 2D picture that characterizes the disposition of <b>hydrophobic</b> and hydrophilic residues in α-helices, {{and can be used}} to study helix–helix interactions, helix-membrane interactions as quantified by the helical <b>hydrophobic</b> moment, or protein-protein interactions.|$|E
25|$|A model {{based on}} {{electron}} crystallographic density and {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} deconvolution has been proposed to explain the binding of docetaxel to β-tubulin. In this T-shaped/butterfly model, a deep <b>hydrophobic</b> cleft exists near {{the surface of the}} β-tubulin where three potential hydrogen bonds and multiple <b>hydrophobic</b> contacts bind to docetaxel. The <b>hydrophobic</b> pocket walls contain helices H1, H6, H7 and a loop between H6 and H7 that form <b>hydrophobic</b> interactions with the 3’-benzamido phenyl, 3’-phenyl, and the 2-benzoyl phenyl of docetaxel. 3’-phenyl also has contact with β-sheets B8 and B10. The C-8 methyl of docetaxel has Van der Waals interactions with two residues, Thr-276 and Gln-281 near the C-terminal end of β-tubulin. Docetaxel’s O-21 experiences electrostatic attraction to Thr-276 and the C-12 methyl has proximity with Leu-371 on the loop between B9 and B10.|$|E
25|$|The {{solubility}} {{of proteins}} in aqueous buffers {{depends on the}} distribution of hydrophilic and <b>hydrophobic</b> amino acid residues on the protein's surface. <b>Hydrophobic</b> residues predominantly occur in the globular protein core, but some exist in patches on the surface. Proteins that have high <b>hydrophobic</b> amino acid content on the surface have low solubility in an aqueous solvent. Charged and polar surface residues interact with ionic groups in the solvent and increase the solubility of a protein. Knowledge of a protein's amino acid composition will aid in determining an ideal precipitation solvent and methods.|$|E
25|$|Honokiol {{belongs to}} a class of neolignan biphenols. As a {{polyphenol}} it is relatively small and can interact with cell membrane proteins through intermolecular interactions like hydrogen bonding, <b>hydrophobic</b> interactions, or aromatic pi orbital co-valency. It is <b>hydrophobic</b> and readily dissolved in lipids. It is structurally similar to propofol.|$|E
25|$|Like all unconjugated steroid hormones, {{progesterone}} is lipophilic and <b>hydrophobic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{boundary}} region between the <b>hydrophobic</b> inner core and the hydrophilic interfacial regions is very narrow, at around 3Å, (see lipid bilayer article for {{a description of}} its component chemical groups). Moving outwards away from the <b>hydrophobic</b> core region and into the interfacial hydrophilic region, the effective concentration of water rapidly changes across this boundary layer, from nearly zero to a concentration of around 2 M.|$|E
25|$|Carbon-based {{compounds}} – Are typically <b>hydrophobic</b> and non-polar, including {{materials such}} as activated carbon and graphite.|$|E
25|$|Surface living {{animals such as}} {{the water}} strider {{typically}} have <b>hydrophobic</b> feet covered in small hairs that prevent the feet from breaking the surface and becoming wet. Another insect known {{to walk on the}} water surface is the ant species Polyrhachis sokolova. The pygmy gecko (Coleodactylus amazonicus), due to its small size and <b>hydrophobic</b> skin is also able to walk on the water surface.|$|E
25|$|The four {{polypeptide}} {{chains are}} bound to each other by salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and the <b>hydrophobic</b> effect.|$|E
