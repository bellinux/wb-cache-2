The authors' speeches <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> sway their audiences towards or away from any particular candidates, but rather encouraged them to endorse whichever candidates supported Christian values.|$|E
5|$|Following the match, {{the referee}} {{admitted}} {{that at one}} point during the game the ball had passed the Blackburn goal line, but as Queen's Park <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> claim the goal, it was not awarded. Queen's Park would ultimately become the only Scottish club to reach the final of the FA Cup, although they returned the following year where they again faced Blackburn Rovers.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, the IAU officially {{released}} a statement to define what constitutes an extrasolar planet and what constitutes an orbiting star. To date, it remains the only official decision reached by the IAU on this issue. The 2006 committee <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> challenge it, or to incorporate it into their definition, claiming {{that the issue of}} defining a planet was already difficult to resolve without also considering extrasolar planets.|$|E

An 1872 experiment by Heinzmann was said {{to show that a}} normal frog would not attempt to escape if the water was heated slowly enough, which was corroborated in 1875 by Fratscher.|$|E

5|$|After {{considerable}} {{debate and}} various experiments, {{the law was}} changed again in 1972. In an attempt to reduce pad-play the new version, {{which is used to}} this day, allowed batsmen to be out lbw in some circumstances if they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> hit the ball with their bat. Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial.|$|E
5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical theory {{on the belief that}} reason should be used to determine how people ought to act. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave.|$|E

5|$|As {{publishing}} {{began to}} change its form in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, large publishing houses pushed out small, independent booksellers. Johnson <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> form or join one of these new firms. In the late 1790s and early 19th century, Johnson's business declined, particularly as his relatives, John Miles and Roland Hunter, began {{to take over the}} daily operations; Miles was uninterested in the business, and Hunter did not have Johnson's commercial sense or his ability to choose successful manuscripts. In January 1806, Johnson's premises were wracked by a second fire, destroying the building and all of his stock.|$|E
5|$|Despite Queen's Park {{entering}} the match as favourites, it was Blackburn Rovers {{who won the}} game by two goals to one with goals from Jimmy Douglas and Jimmy Forrest; Robert M Christie scored for Queen's Park. The Scottish team had a goal disallowed during play, and the referee later {{said that they had}} scored once more but as the players <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> claim it, he had not bothered to award it. The two teams met once more in the final of the following FA Cup final in 1885.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} weeks of World War II, {{warships}} of the United States Navy, the British Royal Navy, and the Royal New Zealand Navy bombarded industrial and military facilities in Japan. Most of these bombardments involved battleships and cruisers which caused heavy damage to several of the factories targeted, as well as nearby civilian areas. A major goal of the attacks was to provoke the Japanese military into committing some of its reserve force of aircraft into battle. However, the Japanese <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> attack the Allied bombardment forces, {{and none of the}} involved warships suffered any damage.|$|E

5|$|Not all {{relations}} between Egypt {{and its neighbors}} were peaceful during Djedkare's reign. In particular, {{one of the earliest}} known depictions of a battle or city being besieged is found in the tomb of Inti, an official from the 21st nome of Upper Egypt, who lived during the late Fifth Dynasty. The scene shows Egyptian soldiers scaling the walls of a near eastern fortress on ladders. More generally, ancient Egyptians seem to have regularly organised punitive raids in Canaan during the later Old Kingdom period but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> establish a permanent dominion there.|$|E
5|$|Racial {{politics}} {{had long}} {{played a role}} in Baltimore. As the state of Maryland <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> prevent African Americans from voting through Jim Crow laws, political coalitions often involved African American community leaders. Theodore McKeldin, who served as mayor from 1943 through 1947 and from 1963 through 1967, {{was one of the first}} political leaders to work with African American community leaders. By 1999, 63% of Baltimore's registered voters were African American, and 90% were registered to the Democratic Party. Baltimore had not elected a Republican mayor since 1963.|$|E
5|$|Spain {{had claimed}} {{ownership}} of the territory, which comprised part of the present-day U.S. state of Texas, including the land north of the Medina and Nueces Rivers, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> colonize the area until after locating evidence of the failed French colony of Fort Saint Louis in 1689. In 1690, Alonso de León escorted several Catholic missionaries to east Texas, where they established the first mission in Texas. When native tribes resisted the Spanish invasion of their homeland, the missionaries returned to Mexico, abandoning Texas for the next twodecades.|$|E

To add insult to injury, one of the British transports grounded off Long Island and was captured by Patriot forces.|$|E
5|$|The Jeopardy! staff used {{different}} {{means to}} notify Watson {{and the human}} players when to buzz, which was critical in many rounds. The humans were notified by a light, which took them tenths of a second to perceive. Watson was notified by an electronic signal and could activate the buzzer within about eight milliseconds. The humans tried {{to compensate for the}} perception delay by anticipating the light, but the variation in the anticipation time was generally too great to fall within Watson's response time. Watson <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> anticipate the notification signal.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was a British success, {{and resulted in}} {{the withdrawal of the}} Continental Army to Harlem Heights, ceding control of New York City on {{the lower half of the}} island.
