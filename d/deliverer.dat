5|$|In 332BC, Alexander the Great conquered Egypt {{with little}} {{resistance}} from the Persians and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a <b>deliverer.</b> The administration established by Alexander's successors, the Macedonian Ptolemaic Kingdom, {{was based on an}} Egyptian model and based in the new capital city of Alexandria. The city showcased the power and prestige of Hellenistic rule, and became a seat of learning and culture, centered at the famous Library of Alexandria. The Lighthouse of Alexandria lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the city—as the Ptolemies made commerce and revenue-generating enterprises, such as papyrus manufacturing, their top priority.|$|E

Upon his death in 1825, his successor as <b>Deliverer</b> of the Vote in the House of Commons, James Mitchell, moved to the house, living there until his own death in 1833.

5|$|Smith {{was born}} in Alexandria, the son of French {{citizens}} Moses and Eva Shmeilowitz, who were of Russian origin. His father was employed by the French Consulate-General as a clerk. Aged 11, Smith embarked as a stowaway aboard a vessel proceeding to London. Undaunted by this unfamiliar environment, Smith attended Berner Street School, Commercial Street, {{and worked as a}} <b>deliverer</b> in the East End, then an impoverished ghetto where Yiddish was the predominant spoken language. Persecution and extreme deprivation had compelled millions of Eastern European Jews to migrate to Western Europe, the Americas, and elsewhere. By the time of Issy Smith's arrival, Jewish immigration to Britain had peaked and was further curtailed by the enactment of the Aliens Act in 1905.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of Jesus, there was no single form of Second Temple Judaism, and there were {{significant}} political, social, and religious differences among the various Jews groups. However, for centuries the Jews had used the term moshiach ("anointed") to refer to their expected <b>deliverer.</b> A large number of Old Testament passages were regarded as messianic by the Jews, many more than are commonly considered messianic by Christians, and different groups of Jews assigned varying degrees of significance to them.|$|E
25|$|Cyrus the Great (c. 600 or 576 – 530 BC) {{figures in}} the Hebrew Bible as the patron and <b>deliverer</b> of the Jews. He is {{mentioned}} 23 times by name and alluded to several times more. According to the Bible, Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, was the monarch under whom the Babylonian captivity ended. In {{the first year of}} his reign he was prompted by God to make a decree that the Temple in Jerusalem should be rebuilt and that such Jews as cared to might return to their land for this purpose. Moreover, he showed his interest in the project by sending back with them the sacred vessels which had been taken from the First Temple and a considerable sum of money with which to buy building materials. The existence of the decree has been challenged.|$|E
25|$|In 332 BC Alexander III of Macedon conquered Egypt {{with little}} {{resistance}} from the Persians. He was welcomed by the Egyptians as a <b>deliverer.</b> He visited Memphis, and went {{on a pilgrimage to}} the oracle of Amun at the Oasis of Siwa. The oracle declared him the son of Amun. He conciliated the Egyptians by the respect he showed for their religion, but he appointed Greeks to virtually all the senior posts in the country, and founded a new Greek city, Alexandria, to be the new capital. The wealth of Egypt could now be harnessed for Alexander's conquest {{of the rest of the}} Persian Empire. Early in 331 BC he was ready to depart, and led his forces away to Phoenicia. He left Cleomenes as the ruling nomarch to control Egypt in his absence. Alexander never returned to Egypt.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{overwhelming}} crisis facing the Empire that had pitched it into chaos, Heraclius the Younger now attempted to seize power from Phocas {{in an effort}} to better Byzantium's fortunes. As the Empire was led into anarchy, the Exarchate of Carthage remained relatively out of reach of Persian conquest. Far from the incompetent Imperial authority of the time, Heraclius, the Exarch of Carthage, with his brother Gregorius, began building up his forces to assault Constantinople. After cutting off the grain supply to the capital from his territory, Heraclius led a substantial army and a fleet in 608 to restore order in the Empire. Heraclius gave the command of the army to Gregorius' son, Nicetas, whilst command of the fleet went to Heraclius' son, Heraclius the Younger. Nicetas took part of the fleet and his forces to Egypt, seizing Alexandria towards the end of 608. Meanwhile, Heraclius the Younger headed to Thessalonica, from where, after receiving more supplies and troops, he sailed for Constantinople. He reached his destination on 3 October 610, where he was unopposed as he landed off the shores of Constantinople, citizens greeting him as their <b>deliverer.</b>|$|E
