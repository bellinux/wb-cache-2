40|$|Marine sponges produce {{secondary}} metabolites {{that can}} be used as a natural source for the design of new drugs and cosmetics. There is, however, a supply problem with these natural substances for research and eventual commercialisation of the products. In situ sponge aquaculture is nowadays one of the most reliable methods to supply pharmaceutical companies with sufficient quantities of the target compound. In this study, we focus on the aquaculture of the sponge Dysidea avara (Schmidt, 1862), which produces avarol, a sterol with interesting pharmaceutical attributes. The soft consistency of this species makes the traditional culture method based on holding explants on ropes unsuitable. We have tested alternative culture methods for D. avara and optimized the underwater structures to hold the sponges to be used in aquaculture. Explants of this sponge were mounted on horizontal ropes, inside small cages or <b>glued</b> <b>to</b> <b>substrates.</b> Culture efficiency was evaluated by determination of sponge survival, growth rates, and bioactivity (as an indication of production of the target metabolite). While the cage method was the best method for explant survival, the glue method was the best one for explant growth and the rope method for bioactivit...|$|R

The electrical current is applied in the c-axis direction across many intrinsic Josephson junctions (IJJ's) in Bi 2212. The calculations show that the internal temperature increases to an acceptable 10 – 20 K only above the bath temperature for a Joule power density of ~ 10 ^ 5 W /cm^ 3 typical for experiments on THz emission from IJJ's.

50|$|The eggs of Asterina gibbosa {{are laid}} {{in a mass}} and <b>glued</b> <b>to</b> the <b>substrate</b> by their jelly-like coating. Each {{developing}} embryo feeds on its egg yolk and hatches directly into a brachiolaria larva, without the intervening mobile planktonic phase of most starfish larvae. The larva has a pair of asymmetric arms which gradually lengthen, and an adhesive disc with which it cements itself to the seabed. It then undergoes metamorphosis, its arms are reabsorbed and tube feet develop and take {{on the role of}} anchoring it to the seabed. Later the mouth of the juvenile starfish develops and it is able to start feeding.|$|R

The fact that a large fraction of these animals also produce efficient glues for trapping prey, <b>gluing</b> eggs <b>to</b> <b>substrates,</b> attaching soil particles to their body or eggs for camouflage purposes, or transferring sperm, is rather unknown. Not only the physical properties of these glues are interesting, but also the supplementary cuticular structures, that work {{hand in hand with the}} secretions to produce highly efficient adhesive mechanisms.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the bond {{behaviour}} of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) laminates <b>glued</b> <b>to</b> concrete <b>substrates.</b> It formulates a numerical approach completely conceived within the general framework of fracture mechanics which investigates the influence of different choices of the parameters describing the post-elastic process of fracture propagation. This aspect is usually neglected and the theoretical models adopted for describing bond behaviour of FRP-to-concrete adhesive joints are generally based on assuming “a priori” the analytical expression of the interface bond-slip law. Unveiling {{the relationships between the}} above mentioned fracture parameters and the resulting bond-slip interface law is the key purpose of this paper.

First, a single growing rod is considered and the formalism of three-dimensional multiplicative decomposition of morphoelasticity {{is used to}} describe the bulk growth of Kirchhoff elastic rods. Possible constitutive laws for growth are discussed and analysed. Second, a rod constrained or <b>glued</b> <b>to</b> a rigid <b>substrate</b> is considered, with the mismatch between the attachment site and the growing rod inducing stress. This stress can eventually lead to instability, bifurcation, and buckling. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Depth-sensing nanoindentation (DSNI) is a {{very popular}} {{technique}} that is used for evaluation of mechanical properties of both homogeneous thin films and bulk material samples. Recently it has been proposed by the authors to apply the DSNI to components of highly inhomogeneous materials that could contain pores and cracks. The extended techniques assume that the DSNI is applied to very thin films (the thickness is about 10 – 20 μm) of the tested inhomogeneous material <b>glued</b> <b>to</b> a transparent rigid substrate. The combination of DSNI and transmitted light microscopy allows us to visualize the regions of tested components. Because we study not a bulk material sample but rather a thin films <b>glued</b> <b>to</b> the <b>substrate,</b> the approximating functions have {{to be used to}} extract the real elastic modulus of the tested component. We present the results of evaluation of elastic moduli of coal samples at varying depth of maximal indentation using seven approximating functions. Comparing the experimental values with the results of approximations and calculating statistical characteristics such as the residual sum of squares and the coefficient of determination, {{it was found that the}} most appropriate are the exponential decay function and a function based on power-law approximation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the forces {{involved}} in the attachment of M. farcimen <b>to</b> <b>substrate.</b> Many sessile and transitory, aquatic animals rely on the secretion of an adhesive <b>glue</b> for attachment <b>to</b> <b>substrate,</b> like most sea anemones. However, other attachment mechanisms exist. For example, limpets and clingfish rely on suction. The pull off forces of M. farcimen attached <b>to</b> <b>substrate</b> were tested, and then used to calculate tenacity. Two groups were compared. One group was tested with M. farcimen attached to acrylic glass with 1. 5 mm holes drilled throughout, {{and the other was}} tested with M. farcimen attached to acrylic glass without any holes. Tenacity calculations revealed that specimens were more strongly attached to the acrylic glass without holes, suggesting that suction is involved in M. farcimen attachment <b>to</b> <b>substrate.</b> Attachment site selection was also explored. When M. farcimen were given the choice between substrates with holes and substrates without holes, {{there was no significant difference}} in the frequency of selection for attachment...|$|R

We approximate the NW structure as an isotropic and homogeneous hexagonal prism of AlGaAs, with a den-sity given by {{the average of the}} densities of the different GaAs and AlGaAs layers, each weighted according to its thickness (see main text). The dimensions of the NW as well as its length that is tightly <b>glued</b> <b>to</b> the Si <b>substrate</b> on a lateral facet are measured by scanning electron mi-croscopy (SEM). The FEM provides the eigenfrequencies of the NW flexural vibrations and the corresponding mode shapes.

40|$|Innovative {{technologies}} for {{the realization of}} packages and System-in-Packages (SIP) with embedded components will be described. Embedding of semiconductor chips into substrates has several advantages. At first it allows a very high degree of miniaturization, since multiple layers of embedded components can be sequentially stacked. A further advantage is the beneficial electrical performance by short and geometrically well controlled interconnects. Furthermore the embedding gives a homogeneous mechanical environment of the chips, resulting in good reliability. The development of different {{technologies for}} component embedding will be described. One technology, called "Chip in Polymer", uses thin chips which are die bonded and embedded by lamination of Resin Coated Copper (RCC) layers. The electrical contacts are made by laser drilling and Cu metallization. An other approach, which is mainly of interest for flexible substrates, uses flip chips with very thin interconnect. The chips are soldered or <b>glued</b> <b>to</b> flex <b>substrates,</b> followed by embedding in an adhesive layer. Both technologies result in chips which are fully integrated in a flat substrate, either rigid or flex. In both cases further layers an be applied or other components can be conventionally assembled on top...|$|R
40|$|Araneomorph spiders {{have evolved}} {{different}} silks with dissimilar material properties, serving different purposes. The two-compound pyriform secretion is used <b>to</b> <b>glue</b> silk threads <b>to</b> <b>substrates</b> or <b>to</b> other threads. It is applied in distinct patterns, called attachment discs. Although ubiquitously found in spider silk applications and hypothesized {{to be strong}} and versatile at low material consumption, the performance of attachment discs on different substrates remains unknown. Here, we analyse the detachment forces and fracture mechanics of the attachment discs spun by five different species on three different substrates, by pulling on the upstream part of the attached thread. Results show that although the adhesion of the pyriform glue is heavily affected by the substrate, even on Teflon it is frequently strong enough to hold the spider's weight. As plant surfaces are often difficult to wet, they are hypothesized to be the major driving force for evolution of the pyriform secretion. 9 page(s...|$|R
50|$|Hide glue regains its working {{properties}} after cooling {{if it is}} reheated. This property can be {{used when}} the glue's open time does not allow the joint <b>to</b> be <b>glued</b> normally. For example, a cello maker {{may not be able}} <b>to</b> <b>glue</b> and clamp a top to the instrument's ribs in the short one-minute open time available. Instead, the builder will lay a bead of glue along the ribs, and allow it to cool. The top is then clamped to the ribs. Moving a few inches at a time, the maker inserts a heated palette knife into the joint, heating the glue. When the glue is liquefied, the palette knife is removed, and the glue cools, creating a bond. A similar process can be used <b>to</b> <b>glue</b> veneers <b>to</b> a <b>substrate.</b> The veneer and/or the substrate is coated with hot hide glue. Once the glue is cold, the veneer is positioned on the substrate. A hot object such as a clothes iron is applied to the veneer, liquefying the underlying glue. When the iron is removed, the glue cools, bonding the veneer <b>to</b> the <b>substrate.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the bending-induced uniaxial stress {{at the top}} of ultra-thin (thickness ⩽ 20 μm) single-crystal silicon (Si) chips adhesively attached with the aid of an epoxy <b>glue</b> <b>to</b> soft polymeric <b>substrate</b> through combined theoretical and experimental methods. Stress is first determined analytically and numerically using dedicated models. The theoretical results are validated experimentally through piezoresistive measurements performed on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors built on specially designed chips, and through micro-Raman spectroscopy investigation. Stress analysis of strained ultra-thin chips with CMOS circuitry is crucial, not only for the accurate evaluation of the piezoresistive behavior of the builtin devices and circuits, but also for reliability and deformability analysis. The results reveal an uneven bending-induced stress distribution {{at the top of}} the Si-chip that decreases from the central area towards the chipʼs edges along the bending direction, and increases towards the other edges. Near these edges, stress can reach very high values, facilitating the emergence of cracks causing ultimate chip failure...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{debonding}} of {{a thin layer}} initially <b>glued</b> <b>to</b> a rigid <b>substrate</b> and submitted at one end to a constant tension and a cyclic deflexion. The theoretical framework of the modelling is the variational approach of fracture proposed first by Francfort and Marigo [1] and extended here in order to model the propagation of cracks by fatigue. We adopt a Dugdale surface energy, we introduce an irreversibility condition and we require, as in [1], that the body minimizes, at each loading step, its total energy. With these ingredients we obtain fatigue laws like those usually postulated by engineers. The number of cycles until the total debonding depends in particular on the ratio ε between the internal length appearing in Dugdale energy {{and the length of}} the layer. When ε goes to 0, we show that the limit fatigue law is a Paris law; the “rate of debonding growth per cycle ” {{is a function of the}} energy release rate () f G=. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} and numerical techniques {{for evaluation of}} mechanical properties of highly inhomogeneous materials are discussed. The techniques are applied to coal {{as an example of}} such a material. Characterization of coals is a very difficult task because they are composed of a number of distinct organic entities called macerals and some amount of inorganic substances along with internal pores and cracks. It is argued that to avoid the influence of the pores and cracks, the samples of the materials have to be prepared as very thin and very smooth sections, and the depth-sensing nanoindentation (DSNI) techniques has to be employed rather than the conventional microindentation. It is shown that the use of the modern nanoindentation techniques integrated with transmitted light microscopy is very effective for evaluation of elastic modulus and hardness of coal macerals. However, because the thin sections are <b>glued</b> <b>to</b> the <b>substrate</b> and the glue thickness is approximately equal to the thickness of the section, the conventional DSNI techniques show the effective properties of the section/substrate system rather than the properties of the material. As the first approximation, it is proposed to describe the sample/substrate system using the classic exponential weight function for the dependence of the equivalent elastic contact modulus on the depth of indentation. This simple approach allows us to extract the contact modulus of the material constitutes from the data measured on a region occupied by a specific component of the material. The proposed approach is demonstrated on application to the experimental data obtained by Berkovich nanoindentation with varying maximum depth of indentation...|$|R

40|$|Our {{concern here}} is to {{rationalize}} experimental observations of failure modes brought about by indentation of hard thin ceramic films deposited on metallic substrates. By undertaking this exercise, {{we would like to}} evolve an analytical framework {{that can be used for}} designs of coatings. In Part I of the paper we develop an algorithm and test it for a model system. Using this analytical framework we address the issue of failure of columnar TiN films in Part II [J. Mater.

In this part, we used a previously derived Hankel transform procedure to derive stress and strain in a birefringent polymer film <b>glued</b> <b>to</b> a strong <b>substrate</b> and subjected <b>to</b> spherical indentation. We measure surface radial strains using strain gauges and bulk film stresses using photo elastic technique (stress freezing). For a boundary condition based on Hertzian traction with no film interface constraint and assuming the <b>substrate</b> constraint <b>to</b> be a function of the imposed strain, the theory describes the stress distributions well. The variation in peak stresses also demonstrates the usefulness of depositing even a soft film to protect an underlying substrate...|$|R

Hence, six saxicolous lichens, with contrasting distributions on lime-rich and lime-poor substrates in South Gwynedd, Wales, were transplanted onto slate, granite, asbestos and cement. Fragments of the perimeters of thalli were <b>glued</b> <b>to</b> the different <b>substrates</b> using Bostic adhesive. Parmelia conspersa (Ehrh. Ex Ach.) Ach. and Parmelia saxatilis (L.) Ach., fragments increased in area over 15 months on slate and granite but decreased in area or did not survive on asbestos and cement. Fragments of Xanthoria parietina (L.) Th. Fr. and Physcia tenella (Scop.) DC. em Bitt. did not survive on slate and granite while some fragments survived but grew poorly on asbestos and cement. Parmelia glabratula ssp. fuliginosa (Fr. ex Duby) Laund. fragments decreased in area on all substrates and especially on cement and asbestos while Physcia orbicularis (Neck.) Poetsch fragments increased in area on granite and cement, decreased on asbestos and did not change significantly on slate. The results suggested that the distribution of P. conspersa and P. saxatilis was determined primarily by physico-chemical properties of the substrate. By contrast, P. glabratula ssp. fuliginosa may have responded to the transplant procedure while X. parietina, Ph. tenella and Ph. orbicularis may require nutrient enrichment to grow successfully on a substrate...|$|R

Many different colored stones, particularly marbles, were used, along with semiprecious, and even precious stones. It first appeared in Rome in the 16th century, reaching its full maturity in Florence. Pietra dura items are generally crafted on green, white or black marble base stones. Typically the resulting panel is completely flat, but some examples where the image is in low relief were made, taking the work more into the area of hardstone carving.|$|R
