25|$|In May 2006, Cantwell, {{along with}} 38 of 44 Senate Democrats, {{voted in favor}} of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S. 2611). This {{controversial}} legislation includes provisions to improve border security, increases fines and other punishments for employers of illegal immigrants, creation of a <b>guest</b> <b>worker</b> <b>program</b> (which includes an almost doubling of the number of H1-B visas), and creates a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the country.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} of this thesis argues that {{allowing}} greater immigration from poor countries to rich countries is a promising way to alleviate global poverty. Since <b>guest</b> <b>worker</b> <b>programs</b> may be a politically realistic way of increasing immigration from poor countries to rich countries, then if the argument in chapter one is successful, there are strong reasons for {{people who care about}} reducing global poverty to support increased <b>guest</b> <b>worker</b> <b>programs.</b> However, some philosophers argue that <b>guest</b> <b>worker</b> <b>programs</b> are unjust because they are likely to cause worrisome relational inequalities between <b>guest</b> <b>workers</b> and full citizens. The second chapter of this thesis argues that these relational egalitarian arguments against <b>guest</b> <b>worker</b> <b>programs</b> fail, and that there are in fact strong relational egalitarian reasons to support increased <b>guest</b> <b>worker</b> <b>programs...</b>|$|R
50|$|There is a {{consensus}} among legal experts that America’s <b>guest</b> <b>worker</b> <b>programs</b> have had unintended negative consequences. Since {{the establishment of the}} Bracero <b>Program,</b> America's <b>guest</b> <b>worker</b> <b>programs</b> have been accused of creating abusive working conditions, withholding payments, lowering wages for domestic farm workers, and providing inadequate incentives for workers to return to their home countries. Many trade associations, such as the Associated Builders and Contractors and the National Electrical Contractors Association, oppose <b>guest</b> <b>worker</b> <b>programs</b> because of their economic consequences, while labor groups, such as Laborers' International Union of North America, United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, and the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, are sensitive to the American <b>guest</b> <b>worker</b> <b>program's</b> history of rights violations.|$|R

For example, economist Dani Rodrik estimates that <b>guest</b> <b>worker</b> <b>programs</b> in wealthy states would generate $ 200 billion or more annually for poor countries.

This is particularly true of the agricultural industry, which hosts a large number of migrant workers through the H-2A visa program.

2500|$|For {{those who}} enter the US {{illegally}} across the Mexico–United States border and elsewhere, migration is difficult, expensive and dangerous. Virtually all undocumented immigrants have no avenues for legal entry to the United States due to the restrictive legal limits on green cards, and lack of immigrant visas for low-skilled workers. Participants in debates on immigration in the early twenty-first century called for increasing enforcement of existing laws governing illegal immigration to the United States, building a barrier along {{some or all of}} the [...] Mexico-U.S. border, or creating a new <b>guest</b> <b>worker</b> <b>program.</b> Through much of 2006 the country and Congress was immersed in a debate about these proposals.

However, attempts at improving the programs are ongoing and have been vigorously debated. While the United States' <b>guest</b> <b>worker</b> <b>programs</b> do not explicitly focus on any specific nationality, such plans typically target labor from Mexico, due to the shared border between the countries, the economic disparity between the United States and Mexico, {{and the history of}} programs between the countries.|$|R

His prominent role in promoting the Senate's 2006 immigration legislation, including an initial cosponsorhip role with Ted Kennedy, made him a focus of the debate in 2006, and his support for S.1348 did so again in 2007. The immigration issue caused intense friction within his own party, such as when The Washington Times reported that McCain and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham [...] "first checked with Mr. Kennedy before deciding to vote with the Massachusetts Democrat on an amendment to the Senate bill."

2500|$|By March 2011, Arizona-like bills {{had been}} {{defeated}} or {{had failed to}} progress in at least six states and momentum had shifted against such imitative efforts.

[...] One state that did pass a law based partly on SB1070, Utah, combined it with a <b>guest</b> <b>worker</b> <b>program</b> that went {{in the other direction}} (and fit into the spirit of the Utah Compact).

[...] Other states were still waiting to see what the outcome of the legal battles would be. [...] By September 2011, Indiana, Georgia, and South Carolina had passed somewhat similar measures and were facing legal action. [...] Another anti-illegal immigration measure, Alabama HB 56, was considered tougher even than SB1070; it was signed into law in June 2011.

Labor unions, human rights, and some Hispanic organizations attacked the <b>guest</b> <b>workers</b> <b>program,</b> claiming that it would create a group of underclass workers with no benefits.
