500|$|It {{was unclear}} if Jodie Foster (Clarice Starling) and Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter) would reprise their {{respective}} roles {{for which they}} won Academy Awards in The Silence of the Lambs (best actress/actor). It {{became apparent that the}} producers and the studio could do without one of the original [...] "stars" [...] (and would go on to find a replacement). The withdrawal of both Foster and Hopkins could possibly have been terminal for the project, however.

500|$|In August 2005, ABC {{announced}} that Dick Clark {{would return to}} New Year's Rockin' Eve for its 2006 edition, marking his first television appearance since the stroke. For that broadcast, it was also announced Clark would {{be joined by a}} new co-host, media personality and American Idol host Ryan Seacrest. Seacrest had previously hosted Fox's competing New Year's Eve Live—which, ironically, would be hosted by Philbin that year. Speaking to USA Today, Seacrest reminisced on having watched New Year's Rockin' Eve in his childhood, stating that [...] "I knew when I was on other shows, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> weren't going to beat Dick Clark. He is New Year's Eve." [...] As a part of a long-term deal with Dick Clark Productions, Seacrest also became an executive producer for the special. In an interview with People Magazine in December 2005, Seacrest revealed that while Clark had not completely recovered from the stroke, and that his speech was not exactly like how it was beforehand, Clark had made great progress since the original diagnosis.|$|E

On top of the low earnings from Pinocchio and Fantasia, the company had debts of $4million with the Bank of America in 1944. At a meeting with Bank of America executives to discuss {{the future of the}} company, the bank's chairman and founder, Amadeo Giannini, told his executives, [...] "I've been watching the Disneys' pictures quite closely because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> were lending them money far above the financial risk.... They're good this year, they're good next year, and they're good the year after.... You have to relax and give them time to market their product." [...] Disney's production of short films decreased in the late 1940s, coinciding with increasing competition in the animation market from Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Roy Disney, for financial reasons, suggested more combined animation and live-action productions. In 1948, Disney initiated a series of popular live-action nature films, titled True-Life Adventures, with Seal Island the first; the film won the Academy Award in the Best Short Subject (Two-Reel) category.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Barbara Gordon, the Batwoman character and her sidekick Bat-Girl appeared in Batman-related publications, but were eventually removed at the direction of editor Julius Schwartz for being outdated and unrealistic. Schwartz stated that he had been asked to develop a new female character in order to attract a female viewership to the Batman television series of the 1960s. Executive producer William Dozier suggested that the new character would be the daughter of Gotham City's Police Commissioner James Gordon, and that she would adopt the identity of Batgirl. When Dozier and producer Howie Horowitz saw rough concept artwork of the new Batgirl by artist Carmine Infantino during a visit to DC offices, they optioned the character in a bid to help sell a third season to the ABC television network. Infantino reflected on the creation of Batgirl, stating [...] "Bob Kane had had a Bat-Girl for about three stories in the ’50s but she {{had nothing to do with}} a bat. She was like a pesky girl version of Robin. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> could do a lot better, so Julie and I came up with the real Batgirl, who was so popular she almost got her own TV show." [...] Yvonne Craig portrayed the character in the show's third season.|$|E

500|$|The {{video screens}} showed both live shoots and special footage {{directed}} by Robson. Cohen worked by Danny O'Brien at BCC Video to create double-sided custom video LED cubes that hanged above stage right. There were three larger-sized video screens above the stage area. The gyrating wheel in which Spears opened {{the show was}} made by Branam Enterprises and was attached to a platform also created by Tait Towers. 171 white light [...] were provided by Spectra. The giant music box from which Spears emerged in [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] (1999) was designed by Michael Cotton. Confetti was shot from machines provided by Pyrotek. Pyrotechnics were done by Gerb Fountains, whereas artificial snow was provided by Little Blizzard. During the encore performance of [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), there was a water screen {{in which it was}} poured nearly two tons of water pumped at 360 gallons a minute. Cohen said, [...] "The water screen is the keystone of the entire design because it impacts every system—electrics, staging, dancing. Rob discovered the company (Chameleon Productions of Orlando, Florida) that makes the screen, and I immediately looked at what they had in stock, which was a straight line. And <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> didn't want a straight line. We wanted a circular water screen so we could physically build a shower for her to stand in the middle of and not get wet and then walk through when she wanted to. Of course, everyone thought I was crazy, so I suggested a six-sided shape. Everyone was concerned that the gaps between the sections might cause gaps in the actual sheets of water. But I kept saying that if you put them 40' to 50' up in the air, gravity will cause the water to attach to itself, so you end up getting a solid sheet." ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get out there in the world... it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline [...] "a {{loudspeaker}} for political views." [...] Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "I {{had a hard time}} listening to the characters spout out opinions, since none of them really made sense as character views and felt distinctly like the writers just wanted a place to dump their liberalisms – I don't want to only call out Seth MacFarlane because he didn't write this episode, but considering the little bit I know about the show's writer's room, it's pretty safe to assume he has final say on this sort of thing, especially given his 9/11 experience." [...] He also compared the A-story to the television series South Park, noting, [...] "It's very clear that South Park benefits from the short turnaround time between production and air, because it allows that show to comment very quickly on current events, and stay timely. Family Guy seems to do the exact opposite, waiting an extraordinarily long time to weigh in on a serious issue it doesn’t satirize for comedy." [...] He ended his review by commenting, [...] "After last week's bright spot, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> were headed back down for another helping of the usual misery, but this week offered neither a surprise nor an all-out failure, just expected, bland mediocrity." [...] He graded the episode as a C. In a much more positive review, Terren R. Moore of Ology, writing, [...] "It's just funny, and it's got a lot of ways of achieving that funniness, and it's definitely true that the show isn't always in its best form, but [...] "Thanksgiving" [...] shows that Family Guy refuses to be dead yet." [...] He also praised the episode for giving each character their own part in the episode, adding, [...] "while most of the story revolves around Joe, Kevin, and Peter, the three kids and Brian also get time in as well." [...] Moore also stated his enjoyment of the cultural references in the episode, stating, [...] "It's all good fun, and the cutaways are also top notch, including Peter's First Holiday and The Cowardly Lion as Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist. I nearly fell out when Peter described his probably-black coworker {{who turned out to be}} a white guy, which I should have seen coming because it's very Family Guy, but still managed to get a laugh out of me." [...] He gave the episode a nine out of ten.|$|E
