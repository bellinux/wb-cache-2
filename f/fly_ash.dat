5|$|<b>Fly</b> <b>ash</b> {{and bottom}} ash are two {{byproducts}} made through {{the burning of}} coal in power stations. Ash is normally dumped in the station's Ash Lagoons landfill site, which is located on site. Since 2006, ash produced at Lynemouth Power Station has been recycled and used as a sub-fill material {{in the construction industry}} and in the production of grout. In 2007, 63,000 tonnes of ash from the station, along with 100,000 tonnes of ash from the Ash Lagoons, was taken and recycled. In September 2007, Pulverised Fuel Ash was utilised as a filling material in the capping of Woodhorn Landfill, which had been used for the disposal of spent potlining from the smelter.|$|E
5|$|Gases {{from the}} furnace are cleaned using {{selective}} non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions. The remaining gases are passed through fine-fabric bag filters to remove and solid particles, {{before it is}} released from the chimney. Each incineration line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> from the filters contains particles from the incineration, lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. Incinerator bottom ash left on the incineration grate after the burning is moved by converyor to a bunker. Whilst on the conveyor, a magnet removes ferrous metal from the ash for recycling. The remaining ash is then used as an aggregate in the construction industry.|$|E

40|$|High-calcium <b>fly</b> <b>ashes</b> (ASTM Class C) {{are being}} widely {{used as a}} {{replacement}} of cement in normal and high strength concrete. In Greece such <b>fly</b> <b>ashes</b> represent {{the majority of the}} industrial by-products that possess pozzolanic properties. Even thought the contribution of factors, such as fineness and water/binder ratio, on the performance of fly ash/cement (FC) systems has been a common research topic, little work has been done on examining whether and to what extent reactive silica of <b>fly</b> <b>ashes</b> affects the mechanisms occurring during their hydration. The work presented herein describes a laboratory scale study on the influence of active silica of two high-lime <b>fly</b> <b>ashes</b> on their behavior during hydration. Volumes up to 30 % of Greek high-calcium <b>fly</b> <b>ashes,</b> diversified both on their reactive silica content and silicon/calcium oxides ratio, were used to prepare mixes with Portland cement. The new blends were examined in terms of compressive strength, remaining calcium hydroxide, generation of hydration products and microstructural development. It was found that soluble silica of <b>fly</b> <b>ashes</b> holds a predominant role especially after the first month of the hardening process. At this stage, silica is increasingly dissolved in the matrix forming additional cementitious compounds with binding properties, principally a second generation C-S-H. The rate however, that <b>fly</b> <b>ashes</b> react in FC systems seems to be independent of their active silica content. indicating that additional factors such as glass content and fineness should be taken into account for predicting the contribution of <b>fly</b> <b>ashes</b> in the final performance of pozzolanic cementitious systems.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of iron species present in <b>fly</b> <b>ashes</b> {{produced}} from coal combustion on mercury retention and oxidation. To achieve this objective the work was divided into two parts.

25|$|<b>Fly</b> <b>ash</b> is {{also used}} as a {{component}} {{in the production of}} flowable fill (also called controlled low strength material, or CLSM), which is used as self-leveling, self-compact backfill material in lieu of compacted earth or granular fill. The strength of flowable fill mixes can range from 50 to 1,200 lbf/in² (0.3 to 8.3 MPa), depending on the design requirements of the project in question. Flowable fill includes mixtures of Portland cement and filler material, and can contain mineral admixtures. <b>Fly</b> <b>ash</b> can replace either the Portland cement or fine aggregate (in most cases, river sand) as a filler material. High <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> content mixes contain nearly all <b>fly</b> <b>ash,</b> with a small percentage of Portland cement and enough water to make the mix flowable. Low <b>fly</b> <b>ash</b> content mixes contain a high percentage of filler material, and a low percentage of <b>fly</b> <b>ash,</b> Portland cement, and water.
