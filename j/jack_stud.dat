5000|$|Platform framing often forms wall {{sections}} horizontally on the sub-floor {{prior to}} erection, easing positioning of studs and increasing accuracy while cutting the necessary manpower. The {{top and bottom}} plates are end-nailed to each stud with two nails at least 3.25 in in length (16d or 16 penny nails). Studs are at least doubled (creating posts) at openings, the <b>jack</b> <b>stud</b> being cut to receive the lintels(headers) that are placed and end-nailed through the outer studs.|$|E

50|$|The American mammoth donkey, {{commonly}} known as the mammoth jack, American mammoth or American mammoth jack, is a landrace of North American donkey, descended from multiple breeds of donkey imported to the United States. George Washington, with Henry Clay and others, bred for an ass {{that could be used to}} produce strong work mules. Washington was offering his <b>jacks</b> for <b>stud</b> service by 1788. Large breeds of asses were found in Kentucky by 1800.|$|R

50|$|In Lufia II, {{characters}} {{walk around}} an over world map, enter dungeons, fight monsters, buy or find new equipment and spells, {{and set out}} on a quest to save the world. The player's party supports up to four characters at once, along with a Capsule Monster. There are various forms of transportation which the player may utilize in order to travel faster than walking, these include; warping, a spell learned early in the game; a boat, modified by Lexis into a submarine and later a blimp. Various casino games are accessible later in the game; these include Pachinco Slot, Black <b>Jack,</b> Slot Machine, <b>Stud</b> Poker, and Action Bingo.|$|R
40|$|The {{fastening}} of the National Compact Stellarator Experiment's (NCSX) modular coils {{presented a}} number of engineering and manufacturing challenges due to the high magnetic forces, need to control induced currents, tight tolerances and restrictive space envelope. A fastening method using high strength <b>studs,</b> <b>jack</b> nuts, insulating spacers, bushings and alumina coated shims was developed which met the requirements. A test program was conducted to verify the design. The tests included measurements of flatness of the spacers, determination of contact area, torque vs. tension of the <b>studs</b> and <b>jack</b> nuts, friction coefficient tests on the alumina and G- 10 insulators, electrical tests, and tension relaxation tests due to temperature excursions from room temperature to liquid nitrogen temperatures. This paper will describe the design {{and the results of}} the test program...|$|R
5000|$|In 1967 Hydranautics, now Bardex Corporation, designed, patented, {{manufactured}} {{and delivered}} the first shiplift using chain instead of wire rope. These Shiplifts differ distinctly {{in the use}} of hydraulic Chain <b>Jacks</b> and <b>Stud</b> Link Anchor Chain to lift commercial ships, naval vessels and submarines. [...] The five distinct advantages to the Bardex Chain Jack Shiplift are: 1) Chain is inherently less susceptible to corrosion and bending fatigue as any chain corrosion is visible on the outside surfaces as opposed to wire rope. For this reason, Lloyd’s shipping register requires 20% of wire ropes to be removed and destructively tested each year with all wire ropes to be replaced every 5-10 years. Lloyd’s does not stipulate any specific duty life limitations for chains which have been known to last for over 20 years in operation.2) Traditional wire rope shiplift systems rely on synchronous motors powering the winches. These motors cause a large power demand on the system when started. Hydraulic systems start at no load so there is no excessive inrush current demand.3) The use of dual chains for redundancy in lieu of a single wire rope at each hoist provides extra safety and reliability.4) Use of chain allows incremental mechanical synchronization of the entire lift operation. The chain links are made to very tight fabrication tolerances so that after each jacking stroke, the platform is set down on the next set of chain links and the level has been “reset”. Wire rope hoist by comparison can become cumulatively unsynchronized over the duration of a lift requiring the operation to stop and be adjusted.4) At all times the shiplift and the vessel are mechanically held by chain resting on support pins not relying on a braking system. 5) Holding the rigid shiplift platform at the correct elevation for Transfer Operations is a locked mechanical function as the chain is pinned in position without the deflection inherent in wire rope systems. A Bardex Shiplift has never dropped a vessel.|$|R
