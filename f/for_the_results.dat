25|$|Romanian {{shale gas}} {{reserves}} could consolidate the country's {{role as the}} largest gas producer in Central Europe. In May 2012, the government temporarily suspended permits for shale gas exploration while waiting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of the EU's environmental studies on this energy source. In March 2013, Prime Minister Victor Ponta announced that the moratorium on shale gas exploration in Romania had been lifted. This decision could help boost domestic energy resources and reduce Romania's dependency on Russian gas. This decision sparked large nationwide protests aimed at banning the exploitation of shale gas and to remove the current government of Romania.|$|E
25|$|A {{highlight}} of Dunham's later career was the invitation from New York's Metropolitan Opera to stage dances {{for a new}} production of Aida with soprano Leontyne Price. Thus, in 1963, {{she became the first}} African-American to choreograph for the Met since Hemsley Winfield set the dances for The Emperor Jones in 1933. The critics acknowledged the historical research she did on dance in ancient Egypt but did not particularly care <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> they saw on the Met stage. Subsequently, Dunham undertook various choreographic commissions at several venues in the United States and in Europe. In 1967 she officially retired after presenting a final show at the famous Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York. Even in retirement Dunham continued to choreograph: one of her major works was directing Scott Joplin's opera Treemonisha in 1972 at Morehouse College in Atlanta.|$|E

25|$|At the Munich Security Conference in February 2011, Ayalon, {{emphasizing}} Germany’s {{crucial part}} in crushing the Iranian threat, stated: “The Iranian regime today {{is just as}} dangerous {{to the world as}} Hitler was in the 1930s. We don't have the luxury of waiting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of the sanctions on Iran; we must immediately put heavy pressure on Iran until it cracks. Germany, as the strongest country in the European Union, must provide an answer {{to the needs of the}} European states that get oil from Iran, so that they will no longer be dependent on Iranian oil.” He also made an appeal to Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights Navanethem Pillay to cancel her plans to visit Iran, stating that the visit would legitimize a regime that “maliciously violates human rights, executes its citizens and openly calls for genocide”.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study done}} by Jeffrey Trawick-Smith took 60 {{different}} children ages {{three to four}} and observed them playing with nine different toys deemed best for development. They were allowed {{to play with the}} toys in a typical environment, a preschool classroom, which allowed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> to be more authentic compared to research done in a lab. The researchers then quantified play quality of the children with each toy based on factors such as learning, problem solving, curiosity, creativity, imagination, and peer interaction. The results revealed that boys generally received higher scores for overall play quality than girls, and the toys with the best play quality were those identified as the most gender neutral, such as building blocks and bricks along with pieces modeling people. Trawick-Smith then concluded that the study encourages a focus on toys which are beneficial to both genders {{in order to create a}} better balance.|$|E

However, Soviets left Panevėžys without a fight two days later. The Group charged towards Kupiškis and secured Subačius. On May 30 Joniškėlis' partisans broke through the Soviet lines and took Rokiškis in Soviet rear; Bolshevik forces, afraid that they will encircled, left Kupiškis {{on the night of}} May 30–31, and Lithuania secured that city on June 1.|$|E
