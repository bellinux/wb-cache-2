5|$|In 1863, the White Bear {{public house}} {{came under the}} {{ownership}} of the Harman's Brewery in Uxbridge. It had been built close to Primrose Hill Farm near the junction of the Ickenham Road and Kings End. Kings End was a hamlet, with one building {{dating back to the}} 16th century. It was named after a family who <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>there</b> at that time.|$|E
5|$|Pantulf {{was from}} Noron in the Calvados region of Normandy. His family <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>there</b> {{since at least}} around 1030, as a charter of Jumièges Abbey shows the family as vassals of the House of Montgomery in the Montgomery lands near Sées. Pantulf's mother was named Beatrice, and his sister was named Helwise, but his father's name and other {{siblings}} are not known.|$|E
5|$|The French Basque Country {{had been}} a {{favourite}} haven of ETA. Since mid-1968 most of ETA's leadership <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>there</b> and {{used it as a}} base for training, infrastructure and planning attacks. ETA commandos also operated from there, crossing the border into Spain to carry out attacks before fleeing back to France. This led to complaints in Spain that French authorities were not doing enough to tackle ETA activity, preferring to leave the Basque conflict to the Spanish to deal with.|$|E

5|$|The new {{triangular}} arrangement between the Southern Song, Jin, and Western Xia continued {{the age of}} division and conflict in China. The region of Huainan (between the Yangzi and Huai rivers) became a new borderland and battleground between Song and Jin from 1128 to 1141, displacing {{hundreds of thousands of}} families who <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>there</b> for generations. The Southern Song deployed several military commanders, among them Yue Fei and Han Shizhong, to resist the Jin as well as recapture territory, which proved successful at times. Yue Fei in particular had been preparing to recapture Kaifeng (or Bianjing as the city was known during the Song period), the former capital of the Song dynasty and the then southern capital of the Jin, after a streak of uninterrupted military victories.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who moved}} to France {{suffered}} ostracism from the Left for their perceived exploitation of native Muslims and some blamed them for the war, thus the political turmoil surrounding {{the collapse of the}} French Fourth Republic. In popular culture, the community is often represented as feeling removed from French culture while longing for Algeria. Thus, the recent history of the Pieds-Noirs has been imprinted with a theme of double alienation from both their native homeland and their adopted land. Though the term rapatriés d'Algérie implies that they once lived in France, most Pieds-Noirs were born in Algeria. Many families <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>there</b> for generations, and the Algerian Jews, who were considered Pieds-Noirs, were as indigenous to Algeria as its Muslim population.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair {{took up the}} {{environmental}} cause of her birthplace, the Lord Howe Island, in 1982, when it was listed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Though the islanders were pleased with the heritage status accorded to the island, Sinclair was unhappy {{with many of the}} planning and management actions initiated by the Government of Australia to conserve the newly accorded heritage status, as it affected the basic rights of the islanders. Her objections were to the cutting of pine trees planted in the 19th century; she considered these trees (though not indigenous) as part of the island's heritage. When the trees were being felled she threatened to lie down between the trees to stop the tree cutters. Her argument was that the trees added to the aesthetic beauty of the island. She also objected to the neglect of maintenance of embankments that were built to extend the airport on the island, as the embankments were eroding. She objected to the garbage that was being dumped in the lagoon of the island as it was causing health hazards. The management plan proposed by the government to preserve the island's heritage status envisaged restricting the tourist accommodation to about 400 and limiting the number of cars on the island to 100, which she objected for the reason that it was limiting the opportunities to the islanders who <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>there</b> for many years. Another of her protests was on the creation of an aquatic reserve {{in a part of the}} island. She considered this action as detrimental to the fishing rights of the local people who had fished in the area for several years. All her objections resulted in the Ministry of Planning and Environment agreeing to address the issues she had raised. In 1967, she worked in the Prime Minister's Department and dealt with public relations and facilitated the Montreal Expo.|$|E

25|$|Some also {{regard as}} a massive {{injustice}} the fact that Jews are allowed to immigrate to Israel under Israel's Law of Return, even if their immediate ancestors have not lived {{in the area in}} recent years, while people {{who grew up in the}} area and whose immediate ancestors <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>there</b> for generations are forbidden from returning.|$|E

25|$|In Secretary for Justice {{and others}} v.

It was held that as the village representative would represent the whole village, not just indigenous persons, the restriction was not reasonable and electoral arrangements were held unconstitutional accordingly.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, the Lake County Board of County Commissioners {{named the}} road by his house, County Road 450A (CR 450A), as Willis V. McCall Road in his honor. More than 20 years later, the South Umatilla Neighborhood Association, {{a group of black}} {{residents}} on the road, some of whom <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>there</b> for 50 years, asked the Lake County Commission to change the name of the road, as they objected to its honoring a man with such a history. The Commission members unanimously voted to change the road's name back to County Road 450A.|$|E
25|$|The {{area was}} once {{generally}} considered {{to be part of the}} Lower East Side with a large Russian, Ukrainian and Jewish population but gradually changed and by the late 1960s, many artists, musicians, students and hippies began to move into the area, attracted by cheap rents and the base of Beatniks who <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>there</b> since the 1950s. The neighborhood has become a center of the counterculture in New York, and is known as the birthplace and historical home of many artistic movements, including punk rock and the Nuyorican literary movement. It has also been the site of protests and riots.|$|E

25|$|Neil McLennan {{settled in}} an area near the South Bosque River in 1838. Jacob De Cordova bought McLennan's {{property}} and hired a former Texas Ranger and surveyor named George B. Erath to inspect the area. In 1849, Erath designed the first block of the city. Property owners wanted to name the city Lamartine, but Erath convinced them to name the area Waco Village, after the Indians who <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>there.</b> In March 1849, Shapley Ross built the first house in Waco, a double-log cabin, on a bluff overlooking the springs. His daughter Kate was the first settler child to be born in Waco.|$|E
25|$|A casual {{interest}} in learning to paint led Marsh, in 1921, to begin taking classes at the Art Students League of New York, where his first teacher was John Sloan. By 1923 Marsh began to paint seriously. In 1925 Marsh visited Paris {{for the first time}} since he <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>there</b> as a child and he fell in love with what the city had to offer him. Although Marsh had appreciated the drawings of Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo since he was a child—his father's studio was full of reproductions of the old masters' work—the famous paintings that he saw at the Louvre and other museums stimulated in him a new fascination with the old masters.|$|E
25|$|Tumamenang ri Makkoayang's {{choice of}} Tunijalloq as Karaeng Gowa may have {{involved}} the prince's {{close ties to}} the court of Boné; Tunijalloq <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>there</b> for two years and had even fought wars on the side of Boné. Tumamenang ri Makkoayang, Tunijalloq, and La Tenrirawe soon negotiated the Treaty of Caleppa, ending the war between Gowa and Boné. The treaty obliged Boné to grant rights to the people of Gowa within its realm, and vice versa. The borders of Boné were also clarified, with both Gowa and Luwuq (one of Gowa's allies) making territorial concessions. Some of the conceded vassals had previously been subject to Gowa for a century. This arrangement, though unfavourable to Gowa, brought peace to South Sulawesi for sixteen years.|$|E

25|$|Custer later {{talked about}} the area with an elder Samona chief named Chinsoloc who <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>there</b> at one time; he drew a {{detailed}} map from memory, which the topographer found to be accurate. (Note: It is unclear what tribe this refers to; there is no local tribe called Samona. The Skeetchestn Indian Band, of the Secwepemc (Shuswap) Nation, were located {{in the area of}} present-day Savona, British Columbia. Since the 1860s, they have had a reserve there.) Custer documented this encounter and the accuracy of the chief's map in his Report of Henry Custer, Assistant of Reconnaissances, Made in 1859 over the routes in the Cascades Mountains {{in the vicinity of the}} 49th parallel, now in the collection of the National Park Service.|$|E
25|$|As {{suggested}} by its specific epithet reclusa (recluse), the brown recluse spider is rarely aggressive, and bites from the species are uncommon. In 2001, more than 2,000 brown recluse spiders {{were removed from}} a heavily infested home in Kansas, yet the four residents who <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>there</b> for years were never harmed by the spiders, despite many encounters with them. The spider usually bites only when pressed against the skin, such as when tangled within clothes, towels, bedding, inside work gloves, etc. Many human victims report having been bitten after putting on clothes {{that had not been}} worn recently, or had been left for many days undisturbed on the floor. The fangs of the brown recluse are so tiny they are unable to penetrate most fabric.|$|E
25|$|In 1910 30 Asians {{lived in}} Houston. 20 were Japanese and 10 were Chinese. The Chinese {{were the only}} ethnic group with a {{significant}} settlement pattern in Houston until the 1970s. The lack of Asian immigration in Greater Houston was due to historical restrictions on Asian Americans. According to the 1980 U.S. census, 484 Chinese immigrants currently living in the area <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>there</b> prior to 1950, of twelve Asian nationalities other than Chinese listed by the census for the Houston area, there were fewer than 100 immigrants who had settled before 1950. The 1965 Immigration Act, which had ended the restrictions, allowed an increase in Chinese Americans. Chinese residents. The number increased to 121 {{by the start of}} World War II. During the war, many Chinese from southern states migrated {{to take advantage of the}} economy and the population increased by more than twice its size.|$|E
