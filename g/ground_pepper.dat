5|$|Techniques to {{preserve}} birds were attempted {{even from the}} early 16th century {{as shown in the}} writings of Conrad Gesner and Pierre Belon. Belon provided instructions on the removal of viscera and the use of salt {{to preserve}} bird specimens in his 1555 book on birds. These were further improved in the 17th century and a range of preservatives included ash (potassium carbonate), salt, sulphur, alum, alcohol and various plant extracts were used. In the early days of bird collections, most specimens were mounted in unrealistic positions often with their wings raised as if they were about to take flight. These were kept in the open and the colours were prone to fading and the specimens themselves prone to damage by beetles. In Berlin, J. L. Frisch started using tightly enclosed glass jars for every mount to prevent pest damage. During this time, Comte de Reaumur at the Paris Museum had managed to find techniques to preserve specimens dry and without loss of colour. This technique was however a secret and similar results were later achieved by pickling using salt, <b>ground</b> <b>pepper</b> and alum and drying for a month with threads holding the bird in a natural position. The use of arsenic to preserve specimens was first introduced by Jean-Baptiste Bécoeur (1718-1777) but this method was publicly revealed only in 1800 by Louis Dufresne in Daudin's Traité Élémentaire et Complet d’Ornithologie (1800). In modern collections, salvaged or collected birds may be preserved in a number of ways. The most traditional preparation is a study skin, in which almost all of the body inside the skin is removed and replaced with cotton so that the final result resembles a bird lying on its back with its wings folded. Borax is used as the preferred preservative as it is low in toxicity. This stereotypic posture was developed to enable many skins to be kept together in cabinets to protect them from insect and light damage. If a complete skeleton is desired, a flat skin may be prepared: all bones, muscle, digestive and other soft tissue is carefully removed and the feathers and skin are stretched flat and dried.|$|E
25|$|Steak tartare is a French dish {{made from}} finely chopped or ground (minced) raw meat (often beef). More accurately, {{it is scraped}} {{so as not to}} let even the {{slightest}} of the sinew fat get into the scraped meat. It is often served with onions, capers, seasonings such as fresh <b>ground</b> <b>pepper</b> and Worcestershire sauce, and sometimes raw egg yolk.|$|E
25|$|Dried <b>ground</b> <b>pepper</b> {{has been}} used since antiquity for both its flavour and as a {{traditional}} medicine. Black pepper is the world's most traded spice. It {{is one of the}} most common spices added to cuisines around the world. The spiciness of black pepper is due to the chemical piperine, not to be confused with the capsaicin characteristic of chili peppers. Black pepper is ubiquitous in the modern world as a seasoning and is often paired with salt.|$|E

500|$|Curry {{was created}} by the arrival of the British in India in the seventeenth century, {{beginning}} as bowls of spicy sauce used, Lizzie Collingham writes, to add [...] "bite to the rather bland flavours of boiled and roasted meats." [...] The 1758 edition of Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery contains what Clarissa Dickson Wright calls a [...] "famous recipe" [...] which describes how [...] "To make a currey the Indian way"; it flavours chicken with onions fried in butter, the chicken being fried with turmeric, ginger and <b>ground</b> <b>pepper,</b> and stewed in its own stock with cream and lemon juice. Dickson Wright comments that she was [...] "a bit sceptical" [...] of this recipe, as it had few of the expected spices, but was [...] "pleasantly surprised by the end result" [...] which had [...] "a very good and interesting flavour".|$|E
500|$|In mid-1932 Nordisk folkereisning i Norge {{was forced}} to confirm that even though Quisling {{remained}} in the cabinet, he would not {{become a member of}} the party. They further stated that the party programme had no basis in fascism of any kind, including the National Socialism model. This did not dampen criticism of Quisling, who remained constantly in the headlines, although he was gradually earning a reputation as a disciplined and efficient administrator. After he was attacked in his office by a knife-wielding assailant who threw <b>ground</b> <b>pepper</b> in his face on 2 February 1932, some newspapers, instead of focusing on the attack itself, suggested that the assailant had been the jealous husband of one of Quisling's cleaners; others, especially those aligned with the Labour Party, posited that the whole thing had been staged. In November 1932, Labour politician Johan Nygaardsvold put this theory to Parliament, prompting suggestions that charges of slander be brought against him. No charges were brought, and the identity of the assailant has never been confirmed. Quisling later indicated it was an attempt to steal military papers recently left by Swedish Lieutenant Colonel Wilhelm Kleen. The so-called [...] "pepper affair" [...] served to polarise opinion about Quisling, and government fears grew concerning reasonably open Soviet elements in Norway who had been active in promoting industrial unrest.|$|E
2500|$|Black pepper (Piper nigrum) is a {{flowering}} vine in {{the family}} Piperaceae, cultivated for its fruit, which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning.

Total mesophilic aerobic spore-forming bacteria was determined in all irradiated samples. However coliform group bacteria, S. aureus and mold were determined in a few samples, E. coli and yeast were not found in none of them. As reported in previous studies, spore-forming bacteria are more resistant to irradiation than vegetative forms.

2500|$|Grace Hopper {{is famous}} for her nanoseconds visual aid. People (such as generals and admirals) used to ask her why {{satellite}} communication took so long. [...] She started handing out pieces of wire that were just under one foot long (11.80 inches)—the distance that light travels in one nanosecond. She gave these pieces of wire the metonym [...] "nanoseconds." [...] She was careful to tell her audience that {{the length of her}} nanoseconds was actually the maximum speed the signals would travel in a vacuum, and that signals would travel more slowly through the actual wires that were her teaching aids. Later she used the same pieces of wire to illustrate why computers had to be small to be fast. At many of her talks and visits, she handed out [...] "nanoseconds" [...] to everyone in the audience, contrasting them with a coil of wire 984 feet long, representing a microsecond. Later, while giving these lectures while working for DEC, she passed out packets of pepper, calling the individual grains of <b>ground</b> <b>pepper</b> picoseconds.|$|E
