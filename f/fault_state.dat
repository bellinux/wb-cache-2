5000|$|Atiyah's Accidents, Compensation and the Law (2006) {{is a legal}} text, which {{marked the}} first of Cambridge University Press's [...] "Law in Context" [...] series. It was {{originally}} authored by English legal scholar, Patrick Atiyah in 1970 and has {{been taken over by}} Professor Peter Cane since the 4th edition in 1987. The thrust of the book is that the law of tort should be abolished, especially as relates to the law on personal injuries, and should be replaced with a no <b>fault</b> <b>state</b> compensation system. Its arguments are in tune with the establishment in the 1970s of such a system in New Zealand, with the Accident Compensation Commission.|$|E

Rotating machines are most often equipped with monitoring instrumentation systems, but experts are needed to recognise the <b>fault</b> <b>states</b> and perform repair decisions. The report presents work based upon a physical model of a rotating machine. A mathematical model is used to generate measurement data for this particular machine. These simulated vibration data are used to generate rules in ROSETTA for classification of <b>fault</b> <b>states.</b> In this case the <b>fault</b> <b>states</b> are unbalance on one of three discs placed on the shaft of the machine.

30|$|If {{there are}} no {{measures}} for recognition, the final consequence of many <b>fault</b> <b>states</b> is a derailment. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} prevent the long-lasting occurrence of all critical <b>fault</b> <b>states.</b> Because of the movement of the train, most of the relevant <b>fault</b> <b>states</b> can not be observed directly. Thus, suitable indicators have to be measured, which can be done by onboard or wayside monitoring systems [3].|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The rosetta system, a toolkit for {{rough set}} analysis, {{is being used}} to {{classify}} different <b>fault</b> <b>states</b> in a large diesel engine. The data measured from this engine was collected from six different <b>states,</b> five <b>fault</b> <b>states</b> and the normal state, and from 15 different measurement points. The approach addresses two important questions; How much data is needed to induce an effective model? How can the amount of data in consideration be reduced using knowledge about how the engine works...|$|R
40|$|Proposed is a method, {{implemented}} in software, for estimating <b>fault</b> <b>state</b> of an apparatus outfitted with sensors. At each execution period the method processes sensor {{data from the}} apparatus to obtain a set of parity parameters, which are further used for estimating <b>fault</b> <b>state.</b> The estimation method formulates a convex optimization problem for each fault hypothesis and employs a convex solver to compute fault parameter estimates and fault likelihoods for each fault hypothesis. The highest likelihoods and corresponding parameter estimates are transmitted to a display device or an automated decision and control system. The obtained accurate estimate of <b>fault</b> <b>state</b> {{can be used to}} improve safety, performance, or maintenance processes for the apparatus...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{consider}} {{a model for}} Dynamic Multiple Fault Diagnosis (£¥¤§¦¨ £) problem arising in online monitoring of complex systems and present a solution. This problem involves real-time inference of the most likely set of faults and their time-evolution based on blocks of unreliable test outcomes over time. In the £¥¤§¦¨£ problem, there is a finite set of mutually independent <b>fault</b> <b>states,</b> and a finite set of sensors (tests) are used to monitor their status. We model the dependency of test outcomes on the <b>fault</b> <b>states</b> via the traditional D-matrix (fault dictionary). The tests are imperfect {{in the sense that}} they can have missed detections, false alarms, or may be available asynchronously. Based on the imperfect observations over time, the problem is to identify the most likely evolution of <b>fault</b> <b>states</b> over time. The £¥¤§¦¨ £ problem is an intractable NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Consequently, we decompose the £¥¤§¦¨ £ problem into a series of decoupled subproblems, one for each sample epoch. For a single epoch ¤§¦¨ £, we develop a fast and high-quality deterministic simulated annealing method. Based on the sequential inferences, a local search and update scheme is applied to further improve the solution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} novel {{framework}} for learning crosssensory and sensorimotor correlations {{in order to}} detect and localize faults in mobile robots. Unlike traditional fault detection and identification schemes, we do not use a priori models of <b>fault</b> <b>states</b> or system dynamics. Instead, we utilize additional information and possible source of redundancy that mobile robots have available to them, namely a hierarchical graph representing stages of sensory processing at multiple levels of abstractions and their outputs. We learn statistical models of correlations between elements in the hierarchy, {{in addition to the}} control signals, and use this to detect and identify changes in the capabilities of the robot. The framework is instantiated using Self-Organizing Maps, a simple unsupervised learning algorithm. Results indicate that the system can detect sensory and motor faults in a mobile robot and identify their cause, without using a priori models of the robot or its <b>fault</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R

30|$|As {{stated earlier}} and {{illustrated}} in Fig.  2, the proposed protection scheme employs two SVM classifiers {{to discriminate between}} the normal, internal fault and external fault states of the SG. SVM 1 is trained to distinguish between normal and fault states. If the input pattern to SVM 1 represents a normal state, its output is set to + 1; otherwise it is set to - 1. On other hand, SVM 2 is trained to discriminate between internal <b>fault</b> <b>state</b> and external <b>fault</b> <b>state.</b> Its output will be + 1 for input patterns representing internal faults and - 1 otherwise.|$|E

30|$|Through {{implementation}} of FFT on the acquired vibration data, {{it was found}} that the characteristic frequencies under normal, inner-race fault, outer-race fault, and ball <b>fault</b> <b>states</b> are distributed separately in different frequency bands, and that there is little overlap between any two adjacent frequencies in the spectrum. Therefore, three-layer wavelet packet decomposition can also be applied to the vibration data, and thus, eight-dimensional feature vectors can be acquired by calculating and normalizing the energy of each band.|$|R

30|$|An {{incipient}} mechanical {{fault detection}} method, combining multifractal theory and Mahalanobis-Taguchi system (MTS), {{which is based}} on statistical technology, is proposed in this paper. Multifractal features of vibration signals obtained from machine state monitoring are extracted by multifractal spectrum analysis and generalized fractal dimensions. Considering the situation of mass samples of normal mechanical running state and few fault states, the feature parameters corresponding to different mechanical running states are further optimized by a statistical method, based on which incipient faults are subsequently identified and diagnosed accurately. Experimental results proved that the method combining multifractal theory and MTS can be used for incipient <b>fault</b> <b>state</b> recognition effectively during the mechanical running process, and the accuracy of <b>fault</b> <b>state</b> identification is improved.|$|E
30|$|In {{this paper}} a new scheme for {{protecting}} the stator windings of a SG using SVMs is introduced. A multi-layer SVM classifier is proposed to detect and classify the internal faults on stator windings of a SG using the instantaneous values of three phase currents {{on both sides of}} the SG stator windings. The algorithm is verified using simulation results to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and speed. A typical 100 MVA, 13.8  kV, 50  Hz synchronous generator is simulated using Matlab/Simulink software to generate the required test data. The test data obtained from simulation covers all possible states of the SG; namely normal state, internal <b>fault</b> <b>state</b> and external <b>fault</b> <b>state</b> at various conditions such as: fault type, fault location, fault resistance and fault inception angle.|$|E
