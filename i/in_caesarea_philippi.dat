2500|$|Eusebius, {{writing in}} the reign of Constantine I says he himself saw a pair of statues in bronze <b>in</b> Panease or <b>Caesarea</b> <b>Philippi</b> (on the Golan Heights in modern terms) of Jesus and the haemorrhoissa, {{sculpture}} being at this time an unusual form for the depiction of Jesus. [...] By his description they resembled a sculptural version of the couple as they were shown {{in a number of}} paintings in the Catacombs of Rome (see illustration at top). [...] He sees this in terms of ancient traditions of commemorating local notables rather than newer ones of Early Christian art. [...] The statues were placed outside the house of the woman, who came from the city, and was called Veronica (meaning [...] "true image"), according to the apocrypha Acts of Pilate and later tradition, which gave other details of her life.|$|R

40|$|The year is 193 A. D., and the Severan Dynasty has begun. For {{the first}} time in Roman history, the emperor, Septimius Severus, is from Leptis Magna (present day Libya). His wife, Julia Domna, is also a foreigner, from Emersa, Syria. Through {{extensive}} travel, the two were able to create a unified Roman Empire. One of their early trips brought them to Caesarea Philippi, in what is today northern Israel; the coin under study commemorated this trip (199 A. D.). This coin reveals the relationship between Caesarea Philippi and Rome {{in the beginning of the}} Severan dynasty, and it demonstrates the transformation of Julia Domna, especially with regard to her hairstyle. Another captivating aspect of the coin is the unique depiction of the goddess Tyche <b>in</b> <b>Caesarea</b> <b>Philippi...</b>|$|E
40|$|This tondo {{was found}} in 1964 in a tomb <b>in</b> <b>Caesarea</b> <b>Philippi</b> (Caesarea Paneas), a {{foundation}} by Philippus, son of Herod the Great, {{on the site of}} Baalgad by the sources of the river Jordan. It is cast in thick bronze (0. 5 - 1 cm thickness) and measures: Diam: 40 cm, H (of the bust) : 34 cm, W (of the bust) : 24 cm. It was fixed in a roughly lentoid shaped opening in the tondo, size 19 cm x 11 cm. The female represented in the tondo is young and carries a variant of the hairstyle often interpreted as proper to a goddess. She also wears a diadema. She has been interpreted either as a princess or as a goddess, probably Aphrodite. The present author considers the bronze as representing a young deceased female {{in the guise of a}} nymph. In literature such women who died young are often said to have been abduced by the nymphs. Found in a funerary context, the representation would be interpreted as a case of private apotheosis. There are several cases among the funerary portraits in Syria, suggesting deification post mortem. The type of representation belongs to the Greco-Roman repertory, but the tondo has both stylistic and technical features pointing to a local manufacture. A Trajanic-Hadrianic date is a possibility considering the chronology of this item.
