50|$|The dampers {{are filled}} with magnetorheological fluid, a mixture of easily {{magnetized}} iron particles in a synthetic hydrocarbon oil. In each of the monotube dampers is a piston containing two electromagnetic coils and two small <b>fluid</b> <b>passages</b> through the piston. The electromagnets are {{able to create a}} variable magnetic field across the <b>fluid</b> <b>passages.</b> When the magnets are off, the fluid travels through the passages freely. However, when the magnets are turned on, the iron particles in the fluid create a fibrous structure through the passages in the same direction of the magnetic field. The strength of the bonds between the magnetized iron particles causes the viscosity of the fluid to increase resulting in a stiffer suspension. Altering the strength of the current results in an instantaneous change in force of the piston. If the sensors sense any body roll, they communicate the information to the ECU. The ECU will compensate for this by changing the strength of the current to the appropriate dampers.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the parallel computation of flows of <b>integral</b> <b>fluids</b> on a heterogeneous network of workstations. The proposed methodology {{is relevant to}} computational mechanics problems which involve a compute-intensive treatment of internal variables (e. g. fibre suspension flow and deformation of viscoplastic solids). The main parallel computing issue in such applications is that of load balancing. Both static and dynamic allocation of work to processors are considered in the present paper. The proposed parallel algorithms have been implemented in an experimental, parallel version of the commercial POLYFLOW package developed in Louvain-la-Neuve. The implementation uses the public domain PVM software library (Parallel Virtual Machine), which we have extended in order to ease porting to heterogeneous networks. We describe parallel efficiency results obtained with three PVM configurations, involving up to seven workstations with maximum relative processing speeds of five. The physical problems are the stick/slip and abrupt contraction flows of a K. B. K. Z. <b>integral</b> <b>fluid.</b> Using static allocation, parallel efficiencies in the range 67 %- 85 % were obtained on a PVM network with four workstations having relative speeds of 2 : 1 : 1 : 1.

40|$|Ruminant species {{differ in}} the degree that their rumen {{contents}} are stratified but are similar insofar that only very fine particles are passed from the forestomach to the lower digestive tract. We investigated the <b>passage</b> kinetics of <b>fluid</b> and particle markers (2, 10 and 20 mm) in fistulated cattle (Bos primigenius f. taurus), muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and moose (Alces alces) on different diets. The distribution of dry matter in the rumen and the viscosity of rumen fluids suggested that the rumen contents were more stratified in muskoxen than moose. Correspondingly, as in previous studies, the species differed in the ratio of mean retention times of small particles to fluids in the reticulorumen, which was highest in cattle (2. 03) and muskoxen (1. 97 - 1. 98), intermediate in reindeer (1. 70) and lowest in moose (0. 98 - 1. 29). However, the ratio of large to small particle retention did not differ between the species, indicating similarity in {{the efficiency of the}} particle sorting mechanism. Passage kinetics of the two largest particle classes did not differ, indicating that particle retention is not a continuous function of particle size but rather threshold-dependent. Overall, the results suggest that fluid flow through the forestomach differs between ruminant species. A lower relative <b>fluid</b> <b>passage,</b> such as in moose, might limit species to a browse-based dietary niche, whereas a higher relative <b>fluid</b> <b>passage</b> broadens the dietary niche options and facilitates the inclusion of, or specialization on, grass.
