Somervell sometimes pushed extravagant white elephant projects, such as the Canol Road, which he continued long after the strategic imperative behind it had faded.|$|E

5|$|Buffon {{was once}} again the first choice goalkeeper under his former Juventus coach and Trapattoni's {{replacement}} Marcello Lippi, as Italy finished first in their 2006 World Cup qualifying group. Although his place in Italy's 2006 World Cup was initially in doubt, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> investigated for possible involvement in the 2006 Calciopoli scandal, he was later named by Lippi as Italy's starting goalkeeper for the tournament.|$|E

5|$|Hastings {{first became}} {{involved}} in politics after the First World War, {{when he joined the}} Liberal Party to help improve social conditions for the poorer people of the United Kingdom. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> prepared to be the Liberal candidate for Ilford in the 1918 general election but grew disheartened by the Liberal alliance with the Conservative Party, and also by the divisions in the party; as a result, he gave up the candidacy.|$|E
5|$|In April 1986, Cindy and {{her father}} {{invested}} $359,100 in a shopping center project with Phoenix banker Charles Keating.

5|$|In an {{interview}} with America Magazine in December 2016, Scorsese stated that he first read Shūsaku Endō's novel in 1989 when he was invited by Akira Kurosawa to Japan {{to act in the}} lead role of one of the vignettes in Kurosawa's film Dreams. Scorsese described in the interview how he read the novel while traveling between airports and hotels in Japan when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> filmed acting the part of Vincent Van Gogh in Kurosawa's film.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1871, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant had named Hall as overall {{commander}} of the expedition, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> referred to as Captain. Though Hall had abundant Arctic experience, he had no sailing experience, and so the title was purely honorary. In selecting the officers and seamen, Hall relied heavily on whalers with experience in the Arctic. This was markedly different from the polar expeditions of the British Admiralty, which tended to use naval officers and highly disciplined crews.|$|E

5|$|On February 15, 2008, it was {{announced}} that the pro-Western Boris Tadić won the 2008 Serbian presidential election. The 2008 elections were particularly important to Serbia's relations with the United States, as the main challenging party which lost the election, SRS, disintegrated when Tomislav Nikolić split with Vojislav Šešelj over integration into the European Union. When Nikolić split from SRS and began pursuing a pro-European profile (a reversal from SRS's eurosceptic position), <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> advised by American lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie & Associates.|$|E
5|$|Scull appealed his {{conviction}} to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a unanimous ruling in May 1959, {{the high court}} held in Scull v. Virginia ex rel.

5|$|The strain took a toll, and by June <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> laid up {{for days}} on end with stomach problems, {{headaches}} and heart symptoms. For the rest of his life, he was repeatedly incapacitated with episodes of stomach pains, vomiting, severe boils, palpitations, trembling and other symptoms, particularly during times of stress, such as attending meetings or making social visits. The cause of Darwin's illness remained unknown, and attempts at treatment had little success.|$|E
5|$|After the Cournoyer goal, {{the goal}} judge refused {{to put the}} goal light on {{despite the fact that}} it was signalled a goal on the ice. In response, Alan Eagleson (seated across the ice from the Team Canada bench) {{attempted}} to reach the timer's bench to protest, causing a ruckus in the crowd as he made his way to the timer's bench. As <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> subdued by the Soviet police, the Canadian players headed over and Peter Mahovlich jumped over the boards to confront police with his stick. Eagleson was freed and the coaches escorted him across the ice to the bench. In anger, he shoved his fist to the Soviet crowd, as a few other Canadian supporters also gave the finger to the Soviets. The Soviets continued to play defensively. Sinden speculates the Soviets were willing to accept the tie and win the series on goal differential.|$|E
5|$|Although he openly opposed secession {{during the}} American Civil War, federal {{military}} forces labeled Helm a Confederate sympathizer. In September 1862, {{he was arrested}} for this alleged sympathy, but Governor James F. Robinson recognized him as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> transported to a prison in Louisville and had him released. After the war Helm identified with the Democratic Party, and in 1865 Hardin County voters returned him to the state senate. In 1867 he was the state's Democratic candidate for governor. Despite his failing health, Helm made a vigorous canvass of the state and won the general election. He was too weak to travel to Frankfort for his inauguration, so state officials administered the oath of office at his home on September 3, 1867. He died five days later.|$|E
