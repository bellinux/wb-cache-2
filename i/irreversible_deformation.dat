It is reasonable to expect {{a relationship between the}} amplitude of such fluctuations and the elasticity of the network. Since the elasticity measures the resistance of the network to either elastic (reversible) or plastic (<b>irreversible)</b> <b>deformation,</b> the fluctuations should grow larger as the elasticity declines. The divergence of the scattered light intensity at a finite critical temperature implies that the elasticity approaches zero, or the compressibility becomes infinite, which is the typically observed behavior of a system at the point of instability.

50|$|In a {{continuous}} body, a deformation field {{results from a}} stress field induced by applied forces or is due {{to changes in the}} temperature field inside the body. The relation between stresses and induced strains is expressed by constitutive equations, e.g., Hooke's law for linear elastic materials. Deformations which are recovered after the stress field has been removed are called elastic deformations. In this case, the continuum completely recovers its original configuration. On the other hand, irreversible deformations remain even after stresses have been removed. One type of <b>irreversible</b> <b>deformation</b> is plastic deformation, which occurs in material bodies after stresses have attained a certain threshold value known as the elastic limit or yield stress, and are the result of slip, or dislocation mechanisms at the atomic level. Another type of <b>irreversible</b> <b>deformation</b> is viscous deformation, which is the irreversible part of viscoelastic deformation.|$|E

40|$|The use of impacted, morsellised bone grafts {{has become}} popular in {{revision}} {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA). The initial stability of the reconstruction {{and the effectiveness of}} any subsequent process of revitalisation and incorporation will depend on the mechanical integrity of the graft. Our aim in this study was to document the time-dependent mechanical properties of the morsellised graft. This information is useful in clinical application of the graft, in studies of migration of the implant and {{in the design of the}} joint. We used 16 specimens of impacted, morsellised cancellous bone from the sternum of goats to assess the mechanical properties by confined compression creep tests. Consideration of the graft material as a porous, permeable solid, filled with fluid, allowed determination of the compressive modulus of the matrix, and its permeability to fluid flow. In all specimens the compression tests showed large, <b>irreversible</b> <b>deformations,</b> caused by flow-independent creep behaviour as a result of rolling and sliding of the bone chips. The mean permeability was 8. 82 * 10 – 12 m 4 /Ns (SD 43 %), and the compressive modulus was 38. 7 MPa (SD 34 %). No correlation was found between the apparent density and the permeability or between the apparent density and the compressive modulus. The <b>irreversible</b> <b>deformations</b> in the graft could be captured by a creep law, for which the parameters were quantified. We conclude that in clinical use the graft is bound to be subject to permanent deformation after operation. The permeability of the material is relatively high compared with, for example, human cartilage. The confined compression modulus is relatively low compared with cancellous bone of the same apparent density.

40|$|The {{possibility}} is shown {{of the transition}} from reversible to <b>irreversible</b> <b>deformation</b> without additional energy from outside sources by changing the distribution of speeds and accelerations of the particles of the continuum. Two models of <b>irreversible</b> <b>deformation</b> are proposed. The first of which uses a different correlation between transverse and longitudinal deformations at each stage, while the second stage is accompanied by dissipation of energy, stored in the previous elastic stage. For the second model with ideal rigid-plastic continuum, the sequential formation of several families of planes of sliding was substantiated. After {{the formation of the}} first one a sliding starts in the second family, which consumes less energy. The consequence is the dissipation and reduction of loadings, the stand sliding on the first family. For the further development of strain it is required to increase loadings up to a critical value, corresponding {{to the beginning of the}} first stage.

40|$|Structural {{materials}} {{for the design of}} advanced aeropropulsion components are usually subject to loading under elevated temperatures, where a material's viscosity (resistance to flow) is greatly reduced in comparison to its viscosity under low-temperature conditions. As a result, the propensity for the material to exhibit time-dependent deformation is significantly enhanced, even when loading is limited to a quasi-linear stress-strain regime as an effort to avoid permanent (irreversible) nonlinear deformation. An understanding and assessment of such time-dependent effects in the context of combined reversible and <b>irreversible</b> <b>deformation</b> is critical to the development of constitutive models that can accurately predict the general hereditary behavior of material deformation. To this end, researchers at the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field developed a unique experimental technique that identifies the existence of and explicitly determines a threshold stress k, below which the time-dependent material deformation is wholly reversible, and above which <b>irreversible</b> <b>deformation</b> is incurred. This technique is unique {{in the sense that it}} allows, for the first time, an objective, explicit, experimental measurement of k.

The martensitic transformation and the <b>irreversible</b> <b>deformation</b> due to the plastic accommodation of martensite are considered on the microscopic level. The <b>irreversible</b> <b>deformation</b> is described {{from the standpoint of}} the plastic flow theory. Isotropic hardening and kinematic hardening are taken into account and are related to the densities of scattered and oriented deformation defects. It is supposed that the phase transformation and the micro plastic deformation are caused by the generalized thermodynamic forces, which are the derivatives of the Gibbs’ potential of the two-phase body. In terms of these forces conditions for the phase transformation and for the micro plastic deformation on the micro level are formulated. The macro deformation of the representative volume of the polycrystal is calculated by averaging of the micro strains related to the evolution of the martensite Bain’s variants in each grain comprising this volume. The proposed model allowed simulating the evolution of the reversible and of the irreversible strains of a stressed SMA specimen under thermal cycles.
