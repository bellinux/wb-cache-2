40|$|With {{the given}} special Structures, the CD bonded {{stationary}} phases {{are expected to}} have complementary retention Properties with conventional C 18 stationary phase, which will be helpful to enhance the polar selectivity in RP mode separation. In this work, two beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) bonded stationary phases for reversed-phase HPLC, including 1, 12 -dodecyldiol linked beta-CD stationary phase (CD 1) and olio (ethylene glycol) (OEG) linked beta-CD stationary phase (CD 2), have been synthesized via click chemistry. The resulting materials were characterized with FT-IR and elemental analysis, which proved the successful immobilization of ligands. The similarities and differences in retention characteristics between the CD and C 18 stationary phases have been elucidated by using comparative linear solvation energy relationships (LSERs). The force related to Solute McGowan Volume has no significant difference, while the hydrogen bonding and dipolar interactions between solutes and CD stationary phases are stronger than between solutes and C 18, which is attributed to the special structures (CD and triazole groups) of CD stationary phases. Chemical origins are interpreted by comparison between CD 1 and CD 2. Similar dispersive interactions of CD 1 and CD 2 are attributed to their similar length of spacer arms. CD 2 which contains OEG spacer arm has relative weaker HBD acidity but stronger HBA basicity. CD stationary phases display no serious different methylene selectivity and higher polar selectivity than in the case of C 18. Higher acid selectivity and lower basic selectivity are observed on CD 2 than on CD 1. Distinctive retention properties and good complementary separation selectivity to C 18 make I <b>he</b> <b>novel</b> CD bonded stationary phases available for more application in RPLC.

40|$|Non-renewable fossil {{resources}} currently {{play a central}} role for generat ing fuels and chemicals. However, the fossil feedstocks are finite and their use can cause serious environmental problems. Green and renew able energy sources offer a possible solution to these issues, and can h elp satisfying the requirements for a sustainable development. Biodiesel is an excellent alternative to the conventional fossil fuels. The conti nuously increasing demand and production of biodiesel resulted in an ove rsupply of glycerol as co-product, and many efforts have been devoted to upgrading this cheap and renewable compound. The aim of this doctoral project is to develop efficient catalysts to c onvert glycerol and its derivative, dihydroxyacetone, into valuable comp ounds, solketal (2, 2 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxolane- 4 -methanol) and alkyl lactat e. These two products have important applications in various industrial areas related to chemicals, food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Two cat egories of materials were synthesized, characterized and tested as heter ogeneous catalysts for the selected reactions: mesoporous metal-containi ng silicates (e. g., Sn-MCM- 41 and M-TUD- 1) and MOFs (metal-organic frameworks). According to previous studies, the key factor in determining the catalytic performance in both reactions is th e acidity of the catalyst. Sn-MCM- 41, displaying mainly Lewis-type acidi ty, was chosen as the starting point in this work. This tin-substituted mesoporous silicate showed activity in both reactions and particularly i n the conversion of dihydroxyacetone into ethyl lactate, in which it out performed other previously reported heterogeneous catalysts. Its excelle nt activity is ascribed to a combination of Lewis and mild Brønsted acid sites. Besides the acid properties, the accessibility of the active sit es can also affect the activity of the heterogeneous catalysts. Therefor e, further investigation was focused on reducing the particle size of Sn -MCM- 41 to the nanoscale: the shorter mesopores were anticipated to incr ease the accessibility of the active sites. Characterization showed that the newly synthesized XS-Sn-MCM- 41 nanoparticles have larger surface ar ea and more acid sites than the conventional Sn-MCM- 41 with large partic le size. The activity was also remarkably improved, thanks to the easier diffusion through the shorter mesoporous channels. Another strategy that was employed in this work to increase the diffusi on and accessibility consists in expanding the mesoporous structure to 3 D. TUD- 1 is a class of materials with three-dimensional sponge-like open pore system and tunable pore size. Besides, its synthesis is quite simp le and cost-effective as it does not require any surfactant. A series of metal substituted TUD- 1 was successfully prepared and Hf-TUD- 1 was synt hesized for the first time. In the conversion of glycerol to solketal, t <b>he</b> <b>novel</b> Hf-TUD- 1 showed the highest conversion among the studied catalysts and its turnover number was markedly higher than any other heterogen eous catalyst reported in the literature. The outstanding performance of this material in this reaction is attributed to a combination of wide p ores, large specific surface area, acidity, and, especially, a relativel y hydrophobic surface. Hydrophobicity of the catalyst is crucial in the synthesis of solketal because the continuously formed co-product, water, can be removed efficiently, thus shifting the equilibrium concentration towards the products. Metal-organic framewor ks (MOFs) are a different class of porous materials with large surface a rea. Owing to their crystallinity, porosity and the strong metal-ligand interactions, MOFs have been intensively studied in the past decade for a variety of applications. However, their relatively low thermal and hyd rolytic stability limited the application of MOFs in the field of cataly sis. UiO- 66, a zirconium-based MOF, was recently developed and establish ed to have exceptional stability. Inspired by this and by their acid pro perties, a series of MOFs with UiO- 66 structure was studied as catalysts for the conversion of dihydroxyacetone and glycerol. It is the first ti me that MOFs materials have been reported to be active in such reactions and we demonstrated that their catalytic activity can be tuned by suita ble structure modifications. By synthesizing, characterizing and testing different types of heterogeneous catalysts, the conversion of glycerol and its derivative, dihydroxyacetone, into va luable chemicals could be remarkably improved. This doctoral project not only opens new perspectives in the transformation of renewables into va luable chemicals, but also highlights the important parameters in influe ncing the catalytic performance, with the hope to provide helpful r eferences for the design of new catalysts. nrpages: 179 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2005. Mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANETs) {{eliminate the}} need for pre-existing infrastructure by relying on the nodes to perform all network services. The connectivity between the nodes is sporadic due to the shared, error-prone wireless medium and frequent route failures caused by node mobility. Fully self-organized MANETs are created solely by the end-users for a common purpose in an ad hoc fashion. Forming peer-to-peer security associations in MANETs is more challenging than in conventional networks {{due to the lack of}} central authority. This thesis is mainly concerned with peer- t o-peer key management in fully self-organized M ANETs. A key management protocol’s primary function is to bootstrap and maintain the security associations in the network, hence to create, distribute and revocate (symmetric or asymmetric) keying material as needed by the network security services. The fully self-organized feature means that t he key management protocol cannot rely on any form of off-line or on-line trusted third party (TTP). The first part of the thesis gives an introduction to MANETs and highlights MANETs' main characteristics and applications. The thesis follows with an overall perspective on the security issues in MANETs and motivates the importance of solving the key management problem in MANETs. The second part gives a comprehensive survey on the existing key management protocols in MANETs. The protocols are subdivided into groups based on their main characteristic or design strategy. Discussion and comments are provided on the strategy of each group. The discussions give insight into the state of the art and show researchers the way forward. The third part of the thesis proposes a novel peer- to-peer key management scheme for fully self-organized MANETs, called Self-Organized Peer-to-Peer Key Management (SelfOrgPKM). The scheme has low implementation complexity and provides self-organized mechanisms for certificate dissemination and key renewal without the need for any form of off-line or on-line authority. The fully distributed scheme is superior in communication and computational overhead with respect to its counterparts. All nodes send and receive the same number of messages and complete the same amount of computation. ScifOrgPKM therefore preserves the symmetric relationship between the nodes. Each node is its own authority domain which provides an adversary with no convenient point of attack. SelfOrgPKM solves t he classical routing-security interdependency problem and mitigates impersonation attacks by providing a strong one-to-one binding between a user’s certificate information and public key. The proposed scheme uses a novel certificate exchange mechanism t hat exploits user mobility but does not rely on mobility in anyway. The proposed certificate exchange mechanism is ideally suited for bootstraping the routing security. It enables nodes to setup security associations on the network layer in a localized fashion without any noticeable time delay. The thesis also introduces two generic cryptographic building blocks as the basis of SelfOrgPKM: 1) A variant on the ElGamal type signature scheme developed from the generalized ElGamal signature scheme introduced by Horster et al. The modified scheme is one of the most efficient ElGamal variants, outperforming most other variant s; and 2) A subordinate public key generation scheme. The thesis introduces t <b>he</b> <b>novel</b> notion of subordinate public keys, which allows the users of SelfOrgPKM to perform self-organized, self-certificate revocation without changing their network identifiers / addresses. Subordinate public keys therefore eliminate the main weakness of previous efforts to solve the address ownership problem in Mobile IPv 6. Furthermore, the main weakness of previous efforts to break t he routing-security interdependence cycle in MANETs is also eliminated by a subordinate public key mechanism. The presented EIGamal signature variant is proved secure in t he Random Oracle and Generic Security Model (ROM+ GM) without making any unrealistic assumptions. It is shown how the strong security of the signature scheme supports t he security of t he proposed subordinate key generation scheme. Based on the secure signature scheme a security argument for SelfOrgPKM is provided with respect to a genera l, active insider adversary model. The only operation of SelfOrgPKM affecting the network is the pairwise exchange of certificates. The cryptographic correctness, low implementation complexity and effectiveness of SelfOrgPKM were verified though extensive simulations using ns- 2 and OpenSSL. Thorough analysis of the simulation results shows t hat t he localized certificate exchange mechanism on the network layer has negligible impact on network performance. The simulation results also correlate with efficiency analysis of SelfOrgPKM in an ideal network setting, hence assuming guaranteed connectivity. The simulation results furthermore demonstrate that network layer certificate exchanges can be triggered without extending routing protocol control packet...|$|E
