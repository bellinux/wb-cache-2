40|$|Following {{aflatoxin}} B 1 (AFB) exposure, rats readily develop liver tumors. However, {{treatment of}} rats {{with a variety}} of com-pounds, including the synthetic <b>dithiolthione</b> oltipraz and the antioxidant ethoxyquin, protects these rodents from AFB-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Several epidemiological studies strongly suggest that AFB is also a causative agent of liver cancer in humans. However, relatively {{little is known about the}} efficacy of cancer chemoprevention in human and non-human primates. To this end, we examined the effects of chemopreventive agents on AFB metabolism in non-human primates. Hepatic aflatoxin B 1 metabolism profiles of macaque (Macaca nemestrina) and marmo-set (Callithrix jacchus) monkeys were determined and compared to humans. Quantitatively, the oxidative metabolism of this my-cotoxin was similar in the three primate species. In contrast to macaques, both humans and marmosets lacked AFB-glutathione conjugating activity. It was concluded that marmosets resembled human AFB metabolism more closely than the macaques, and therefore, marmoset monkeys were chosen for this study. Eleven adult male marmosets were randomly assigned to three groups. Animals received the synthetic <b>dithiolthione</b> oltipraz, the antiox-idant ethoxyquin, or vehicle only. In addition, two single doses of AFB were also administered orally before and after animals were treated with aforementioned compounds. Both oltipraz and ethoxyquin induced aflatoxin B 1 -glutathione conjugating activity in the livers of some but not all marmosets. In addition, 10 mM oltipraz inhibited cytochrome P 450 -mediated activation of AFB to the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite, aflatoxin B 1 - 8, 9 -epoxide, in vitro, up to 51 %. Furthermore, animals treated in vivo with olti-praz, but not ethoxyquin, exhibited a significant reduction (53 % average) in AFB-DNA adduct formation relative to the control animals (p < 0. 05). Together, our data suggest that chemopreven-tion is also effective in primates; however, most likely to a lesser degree than in rodents...|$|E
40|$|Defective DNA repair {{capacity}} {{has been}} shown to be a common feature of cancer, and loss of function mutations in 'stability' genes that normally maintain the integrity of the genome may prove a key rate-limiting step in carcinogenesis. Since even genetically unstable cells require some repair functionality to maintain viability, these cancers likely exhibit an over-reliance on other DNA repair pathways for survival. Therapeutically targeting backup repair processes in such tumours represents a novel means by which to achieve selective tumour toxicity. Full exploitation of these synthetic lethal interactions will require an in-depth knowledge of the genetic basis of DNA repair in combination with an armoury of small molecule inhibitors of cellular targets. To this end, we have designed, optimised and run two high-throughput cell-based screens to identify genes and small molecules that can modulate mismatch repair (MMR) activity. Key to these screening strategies are the resistance of cells with dysfunctional MMR to a range of cytotoxic drugs, including the alkylating agent N -methyl- N '-nitro- N -nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). By exploiting this MMR-dependent toxicity we have assayed for siRNA and small molecules that permit the survival of MNNG-treated MMR-proficient cells to levels comparable to MMR-deficient cells, and which therefore represent putative MMR modulating agents. A screen of 571 siRNA for gene depletions that reduce MNNG sensitivity by at least two population standard deviations identified 10 genes of potential interest, and included the four canonical MMR genes, MSH 2 (2. 87 ± 0. 28 (Z ± SE)), MSH 6 (4. 87 ± 0. 06), MLH 1 (3. 42 ± 0. 43) and PMS 2 (3. 36 ± 0. 44). TDG represented an unexpected hit that decreased MNNG sensitivity by 2. 55 ± 0. 04 population standard deviations. However, clonogenic survival experiments found TDG depletion to be contextual synthetic lethal within an MMR-null background when treated with MNNG, reducing HCT 116 clonogenicity by 37 % (p 80 % in subG 1 content at 48 hours post-MNNG that was independent of MMR status. Interestingly, the characteristic G 2 /M arrest of MNNG-treated MMR-proficient cells remained intact (~ 40 % arrested). Taken together, these observations are not consistent with NSC 197049 acting as an inhibitor of MMR. Dithiolthiones have been described as chemoprotective agents that induce antioxidant defences, whilst we have found NSC 197049 phenocopies known antioxidants ascorbic acid and glutathione in protecting against MNNG-induced toxicity. NSC 197049 may therefore act by bolstering cellular antioxidant defences. The precise mechanism may be novel, since the proto-typical <b>dithiolthione,</b> Oltipraz, failed to be protective in this study. In summary, we have confirmed that MMR is the primary determinant of MNNG sensitivity, and found that TDG is unlikely to be involved in MMR. We have also identified a novel chemoprotective small molecule that is unlikely to represent an MMR inhibitor, but that might be useful in cancer chemoprevention.

40|$|Exposure of murine {{hepatoma}} (Hepa 1 c 1 c 7) {{cells to}} a variety of chemical agents known to protect animals against the neoplastic, mutagenic, and other toxic effects of chemical carcinogens results in dose- and time-dependent inductions of NAD(P) H:quinone reductase (EC 1. 6. 99. 2). This enzyme protects against quinone toxicity by promoting obligatory two-electron reductions that divert quinones from oxidative cycling or direct interactions with critical nucleophiles. Quinone reductase levels are stable in culture, are easily measured, and are useful markers for the inductive effects of chemoprotective agents. The Hepa 1 c 1 c 7 system responds to chemoprotective compounds such as phenolic antioxidants (e. g., BHA [3 (2) -tert-butyl- 4 -hydroxyanisole], BHT (3, 5 -ditert-butyl- 4 -hydroxytoluene), and tert-butylhydroquinone), lipophilic azo dyes belonging to the 1, 1 '-azonaphthalene, Sudan I (1 -phenylazo- 2 -naphthol), and Sudan III [1 -(4 -phenylazophenylazo) - 2 -naphthol] families, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, coumarin and various other lactones, flavonoids, and certain sulfur compounds (e. g., benzylisothiocyanate, <b>dithiolthiones,</b> and dithiocarbamates), all of which are recognized enzyme inducers and chemoprotectors in vivo. Quinone reductase induction in Hepa 1 c 1 c 7 cells therefore provides a simple, versatile, and reliable system for the evaluation of the potency, kinetics, and mechanism of action of anticarcinogens...|$|R
