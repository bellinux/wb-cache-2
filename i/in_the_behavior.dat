5|$|Tires {{generate}} the lateral forces necessary for steering and balance {{through a combination}} of cornering force and camber thrust. Tire inflation pressures have also been found to be important variables <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of a motorcycle at high speeds. Because the front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. Of the two, understeer, in which the front wheel slides more than the rear wheel, is more dangerous since front wheel steering is critical for maintaining balance.|$|E

25|$|The {{individual}} engages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> {{because the}} response-produced stimulation possesses reinforcing characteristics. In other words, engaging <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> produces reinforcing stimulation {{unique to the}} specific context. For example, a child hits his/her eyes because it produces the specific stimulation of various colors and effects. Another example includes a child spinning a bowl on a table to produce the specific auditory stimulation unique to that object. Common forms of automatic stimulation include, {{but are not limited}} to, auditory stimulation, visual stimulation, endorphin release, etc.|$|E

25|$|The {{individual}} engages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> {{because it}} produces a decrease in aversive stimulation. Put another way, something aversive is occurring in some location on the organism's body, and engaging <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> decreases the level of discomfort. For example, a child bangs {{his head against the}} wall to decrease the pain experienced from a toothache. Another example includes a child scratching his arm to decrease the level of itchiness experienced from a bug bite. Common forms of aversive stimulation abated by engaging in specific behaviors include sinus pain, itching, hunger, etc.|$|E

25|$|The {{individual}} engages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> {{to escape}} aversive socially mediated attention.

Another example includes a teacher telling a student to complete a series of math problems, to which the student flips the desk and is sent to the principal's office. Being sent to the principals office reinforced the behavior of flipping the desk because it allowed the child to escape the aversive activity of completing math problems.

This is similar to other diurnal cichlids where visual clues {{play an important role}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior,</b> including breeding. The speckled or three-barred peacock bass (C. temensis) in particular has caused problems due to its extensive variation, but it has now been shown that the speckled pattern is present in non-breeders and the three-barred when breeding. Although minor variations are known from adults of other peacock bass species, none show the extreme variation of the speckled/three-barred peacock bass.|$|E
25|$|In this condition, {{the child}} is allowed to engage {{with a variety of}} items during the session. No demands are placed on the child {{throughout}} the duration of the session. The experimenter provides attention to the individual throughout the session on any behavior that is not the target behavior. If the target behavior occurs, the experimenter removes attention until the behavior has subsided. This session is meant to act as a control condition, meaning that the environment is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring. Said another way, by meeting environmental needs for all possible functions, the individual is not likely to engage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> of interest. This condition is used as a comparison to the other conditions. Any condition that is elevated to a large degree form the control condition, shows a higher degree experimental control indicating the functional relationship between the specific environmental conditions and the behavior of interest.|$|E
