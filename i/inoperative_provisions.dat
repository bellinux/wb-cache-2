This measure appeared on the November 4, 2008 general election ballot in Oregon. It was passed by voters, receiving 72.59% of the vote.|$|E

25|$|Being of {{the opinion}} that the Court could not apply the Indian Act in the case at bar without {{infringing}} the appellant's rights under the Canadian Bill of Rights, Justice Thurlow declared the impugned <b>provision</b> <b>inoperative.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{question}} this Court considered {{can only be}} answered by determining [...] "whether {{or not it is}} the intention of Parliament to confer the power and impose the responsibility upon the courts of declaring <b>inoperative</b> any <b>provision</b> in a Statute of Canada" [...] if a statute cannot be construed and applied to be consistent with the Bill of Rights. If that is the intention of Parliament, Cartwright argues that Parliament would have added an express provision to s. 2 of the Bill of Rights making that unequivocal, like [...] "[...] [...] and if any law of Canada cannot be so construed and applied it shall be regarded as inoperative or pro tanto repealed." [...] Instead, Cartwright argued that the opposite is true: Section 2 of the Canadian Bill of Rights [...] "directs the courts to apply such a law not to refuse to apply it." [...] Therefore, Cartwright wrote that he would dispose of the appeal {{in the same manner as}} Justice Pigeon.|$|R
5000|$|Section 55 {{requires}} that legislation imposing tax deal only with imposing tax {{and that other}} purported provisions {{in a piece of}} taxation legislation be of no effect. Furthermore, laws imposing taxation (except customs duties or excise) shall deal with 'one subject of taxation only', while laws imposing customs shall deal only with customs, and laws of excise only excise. If a law containing a tax provision is found to include any non-tax provisions, the court will render the non-tax <b>provisions</b> <b>inoperative.</b> In practice, if the tax provision is introduced in an amending instrument, the court will most likely strike down the amending instrument rather than render the entire law inoperative, this is what occurred in Air Caledonie International v Commonwealth. [...] The purpose of this section is to protect the powers of the Senate to amend bills. According to Section 53, the Senate cannot amend or originate taxation bills (see above). Thus, without the restrictions imposed by Section 55, the House of Representatives could prevent the Senate from amending any bill simply by putting something into it concerning taxation. This section effectively prohibits riders on money bills such as are common in the United States, or omnibus bills including non-financial measures such as in Canada, and also results in Australian tax law being made up of several pieces of legislation: for example, some Acts setting out how and when tax is to be calculated and paid, while others actually impose the tax.|$|R
