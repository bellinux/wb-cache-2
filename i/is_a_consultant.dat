25|$|There {{were three}} {{separate}} incidents involving Barack Obama's State Department passport file in 2008. Although these occurred over a three-month span, Obama was notified only on March 20, as upper {{levels of the}} State Department themselves first {{became aware of the}} breaches. On March 21, 2008, the United States Department of State revealed that Obama's passport file was improperly accessed three times in 2008. Three contract employees are accused in the wrongdoing. One, who works for The Analysis Corporation (TAC), accessed Obama and McCain's records and was disciplined. The two other workers, who worked for Stanley, Inc.., each accessed Obama's file on separate occasions and were fired. An unauthorized access of Hillary Clinton's file was also made in mid-2007, but was considered a training error and unrelated to the other instances. John O. Brennan, president and CEO of Analysis, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>consultant</b> to the Barack Obama campaign and contributed $2,300 to the Obama campaign in January 2008. Brennan is a former senior CIA official and former interim director of the National Counterterrorism Center. The chairman of Stanley Inc., Philip Nolan, is a Clinton supporter and contributor; his company has had contracts with the United States Department of State since 1992 and was recently awarded a $570 million contract to continue providing support for passport processing. The State Department is focusing an internal inquiry on the TAC employee, but plans to question all three of the contractors who accessed the candidates' files.|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} U.S. {{version is}} that bin Laden's location at Abbottabad was {{identified by the}} CIA by tracking an al-Qaeda courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Hersh reports that in August 2010 a former senior Pakistani intelligence officer walked into the office of Jonathan Bank, the CIA station chief at the US embassy in Islamabad and betrayed the secret of bin Laden's whereabouts in return {{for part of the}} $25 million reward, and has since been relocated with his family to Washington and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>consultant</b> to the CIA. The ISI had captured bin Laden in 2006; he had lived undetected from 2001 to 2006 with some of his wives and children in the Hindu Kush mountains. The ISI got to him by paying some of the local tribal people to betray him. Bin Laden was very ill and was living as prisoner under ISI control in the garrison town of Abbottabad less than two miles from Pakistan's National Military Academy at Kakul (equivalent of United States Military Academy at West Point). The Saudi government also knew about Osama's presence in Abbottabad and had advised the Pakistanis to keep him as a prisoner and gave financial assistance. Major Amir Aziz, a Pakistani Army doctor, was ordered to move near his compound to provide treatment. Aziz was also given a share of the $25 million reward because he got the DNA sample which conclusively proved that it was bin Laden. A real casualty in the whole affair was the doctor named Shakil Afridi. His perfectly legitimate hepatitis B vaccination programme was claimed to be the way the US obtained bin Laden's DNA. Afridi became the sacrificial lamb because the US wanted to protect its real CIA informant, Amir Aziz, who had been held by the Pakistanis. Afridi was sentenced to 33 years by the Pakistanis. Other vaccination programmes were canceled once this lie was put forth.|$|E

2500|$|Dan Hamilton is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC medical drama Holby City, played by actor Adam Astill. He {{first appeared in}} the series thirteen episode [...] "Blue Valentine", broadcast on 15 February 2011. Dan <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>consultant</b> orthopaedic surgeon, who works in the general surgery ward, Keller. He was created in 2010 and Astill successfully auditioned for the role three months prior to beginning filming in November. Dan has been characterised through his boyish and impulsive nature. He portrayed as a wannabe [...] "ladies' man". New to his role as a consultant, Dan plays up to the stereotype associated with public schooled orthopaedic surgeons. His storylines have developed through a relationship with ward sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley) and a rivalry with registrar Antoine Malick (Jimmy Akingbola), whom he later kisses. The latter has attracted a mixed reaction from critics of the series, who felt it was a repetition of gay story-lines featuring in other serial dramas. In May 2012, it was announced that Astill had decided to leave the series.|$|E

2500|$|Neuropathology is {{the study}} of disease of nervous system tissue, usually in the form of either {{surgical}} biopsies or sometimes whole brains in the case of autopsy. Neuropathology is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology, neurology, and neurosurgery. [...] In many English-speaking countries, neuropathology is considered a subfield of anatomical pathology. [...] A physician who specializes in neuropathology, usually by completing a fellowship after a residency in anatomical or general pathology, is called a neuropathologist. In day-to-day clinical practice, a neuropathologist <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>consultant</b> for other physicians. If a disease of the nervous system is suspected, and the diagnosis cannot be made by less invasive methods, a biopsy [...] of nervous tissue is taken from the brain or spinal cord to aid in diagnosis. [...] Biopsy is usually requested after a mass is detected by medical imaging. With autopsies, the principal work of the neuropathologist is to help in the post-mortem diagnosis of various conditions that affect the central nervous system. [...] Biopsies can also consist of the skin. Epidermal nerve fiber density testing (ENFD) is a more recently developed neuropathology test in which a punch skin biopsy is taken to identify small fiber neuropathies by analyzing the nerve fibers of the skin. This test is becoming available in select labs as well as many universities; it replaces the traditional nerve biopsy test as less invasive.|$|E
