5|$|In John (18:1–11), Jesus {{does not}} pray to be spared his crucifixion, as the gospel portrays him as {{scarcely}} touched by such human weakness. The people who arrest him are Roman soldiers and Temple guards. Instead of being betrayed by a kiss, Jesus proclaims his identity, {{and when he}} does, the soldiers and officers <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The gospel identifies Peter as the disciple who used the sword, and Jesus rebukes him for it.|$|E
5|$|The {{combat system}} in Dwarf Fortress is anatomically detailed. Combat is {{displayed}} by viewing the log which describes each weapon striking a specific {{part of the}} character's body. Internal organs can get punctured, combatants can <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> vomit and lose body parts. Each dwarf has individually detailed limbs, each with damageable bone, fat, muscle and skin. Fat can be bruised without breaking bones and vice versa. Injuries sometimes can be permanent. There is a medical system where a hospital {{can be set up}} containing crutches for disabled dwarves, traction benches, plasters and cloth for casts and bandages, thread for suturing, and splints.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, {{he acted}} as escort for No. 11 Squadron RAF. Only one enemy aircraft was sighted by Pattle, {{though none of}} the squadron could see it. He left {{them in order to}} deal with the intruder. Thirty seconds later, they witnessed an explosion and a CR.42 <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> while Pattle rejoined them. It is believed he attacked a reconnaissance Dornier Do 17 from Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 ("dive bomber wing 2") which he claimed destroyed, though it appears it made it back to German lines damaged. On 8 April, despite bad weather, Pattle led an attack on Petrich in Yugoslavia and left a number of enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground.|$|E
5|$|As {{they enter}} the room, the man stands up and holds the briefcase. During the third chorus, they engage in battle and {{circulate}} the room for defence. Inter cut scenes have the group dancing to the song in the room. Perfume member Kashiyuka summons a mini version of herself, holding onto it, and casting a spell against the man, making him <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> As they celebrate, Perfume member Nocchi goes towards him and retrieves the briefcase. However, the man stands up and transforms into a polar bear; he then pushes Nocchi to the ground. Perfume member A-Chan throws an apple as a detraction, and the group attacks the bear by using laser beams. Defeated, the polar bear shrinks and transforms into a plush toy. A-Chan picks up the plush toy, and Kashiyuka opens the briefcase to witness a small gold ornament. The video ends with the group exiting the office.|$|E
5|$|Bianchi {{collided}} with {{the rear of the}} tractor crane, which caused extensive damage to his car; its roll bar was destroyed as it slid underneath. The impact jolted the tractor crane off the ground, causing Sutil's car (suspended in the air by the crane) to <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Marshals moved away from the scene to avoid being struck by Bianchi's Marussia. Calculations in July 2015 indicated a peak of 254 g0 (2,490m/s2), and data from the FIA's World Accident Database—which sources information from racing accidents worldwide—indicate that Bianchi's impact occurred 2.61 seconds after loss of control, at a speed of 123km/h (76mph) and an angle of 55 degrees. Bianchi was reported unconscious after not responding to a team radio call or marshals. Marshals reported the accident, and safety and medical cars were dispatched. Bianchi was extracted from his car and treated at the crash site before being taken by ambulance to the circuit's medical centre. Transport by helicopter was impossible due to the weather; Bianchi was taken by ambulance with a police escort to Mie Prefectural General Medical Center in Yokkaichi, about 15km (9.3mi, a 32-minute drive) from the track.|$|E

5|$|Some animals {{could also}} be {{regarded}} as dragonlike, such as rams. It was said that a rooster, a gander, or a turkeycock could grow a pair of little wings beneath their natural wings, thus becoming powerful dragons. A dragon rooster dug a hole beneath the threshold of his owner's house. As soon as dark clouds appeared, the rooster {{would go into the}} hole, and his spirit would fly out from his body into the clouds to fight with ale. One day the owner killed the rooster, and immediately went mad. Another dragon rooster, with two combs, would <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and lie as if dead during thunderstorms. The Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian and smok in Bulgarian) was regarded as a very beneficial animal. People avoided disturbing it in any way. The Aesculapian snake which inhabited a crop field or a vineyard was seen as its guardian. The snake was said to fly into the hail clouds and drive them away from its field or yard, or it dispersed the clouds by raising its head high in the air and hissing as strong as it could. In the region of Niš, the Aesculapian snakes were said to help the dragon boy in his fights against ale. If an Aesculapian snake attained a certain age, it would grow wings and become a dragon.|$|E
5|$|The most {{pressing}} threat for many species, particularly the smaller ones, comes from species introduced to their colonies. Procellariids overwhelmingly breed on islands away from land predators such as mammals, {{and for the}} most part have lost the defensive adaptations needed to deal with them (with the exception of the oil-spitting fulmarine petrels). The introduction of mammal predators such as feral cats, rats, mongooses and even mice can have disastrous results for ecologically naïve seabirds. These predators can either directly attack and kill breeding adults, or, more commonly, attack eggs and chicks. Burrowing species that leave their young unattended at a very early stage are particularly vulnerable to attack. Studies on grey-faced petrels breeding on New Zealand's Whale Island (Moutohora) have shown that a population under heavy pressure from Norway rats will produce virtually no young during a breeding season, whereas if the rats are controlled (through the use of poison), breeding success is much higher. That study also highlighted the role that non-predatory introduced species can play in harming seabirds; introduced rabbits on the island caused little damage to the petrels, other than damaging their burrows, but they also acted as a food source for the rats during the non-breeding season, which allowed rat numbers to be higher than they otherwise would be, resulting in more predators for the petrels to contend with. Interactions with introduced species can be quite complex. Gould's petrels breed only on two islands, Cabbage Tree Island and Boondelbah Island off Port Stephens (New South Wales). Introduced rabbits destroyed the forest understory on Cabbage Tree Island; this both increased the vulnerability of the petrels to natural predators and left them vulnerable to the sticky fruits of the birdlime tree (Pisonia umbellifera), a native plant. In the natural state these fruits lodge in the understory of the forest, but with the understory removed the fruits <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> where the petrels move about, sticking to their feathers and making flight impossible.|$|E

40|$|<b>Falls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> is a {{major health}} issue in older {{adulthood}} and a primary cause for nursing home placement and premature death. Older adults who are sedentary have a greater likelihood of <b>falling</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> than those who exercise. The present study {{examined the relationship between}} exercise, gender, poverty level, and <b>falls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in older adults. The data utilized in this study was obtained from the California Health Interview Survey, (CHIS) 2007 Adult's survey. The main independent variables for this study are levels and frequencies of exercise. They are characterized as Vigorous Leisure Activity for 3 days/ wk and 20 min/day, Regular Moderate, or Vigorous Activity, and Moderate Leisure Activity for 5 days/wk and 30 min/day. The independent variables, gender, and socioeconomic status are also examined. SES is characterized by combined measures of poverty level and educational attainment. To distinguish between younger seniors versus older seniors, this re- search compiled those in the age group of 60 to 74 years of age, and 75 years of age plus. The dependent variable is, <b>falls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in past 12 months. In order <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> relationships between variables, frequencies and regression analyses were performed. The regression analyses found that the prominent predictors of <b>Falls</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> among <b>the</b> elderly were exercise and gender...|$|R

25|$|In Australia R. romandi {{is found}} in Northern Territory and Queensland. It {{is one of the}} most common paper wasp species in Eastern Queensland. R. romandi lives in both {{tropical}} and temperate climates. However, their habitats are prone to cold winters, which results in seasonal colony activity. Nests can be found hanging from the underside of various tree branches and building eaves at anywhere from 2.5m to 30m above the ground. They commonly attach their nests to Eucalypts, which shed their bark frequently. When this occurs, the nests <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and are abandoned by the colony.

25|$|Sulfate {{aerosols}} promote complex {{chemical reactions}} on their surfaces that alter chlorine and nitrogen chemical {{species in the}} stratosphere. This effect, together with increased stratospheric chlorine levels from chlorofluorocarbon pollution, generates chlorine monoxide (ClO), which destroys ozone (O3). As the aerosols grow and coagulate, they settle down into the upper troposphere where they serve as nuclei for cirrus clouds and further modify the Earth's radiation balance. Most of the hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) are dissolved in water droplets in the eruption cloud and quickly <b>fall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> as acid rain. The injected ash also falls rapidly from the stratosphere; {{most of it is}} removed within several days to a few weeks. Finally, explosive volcanic eruptions release the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and thus provide a deep source of carbon for biogeochemical cycles.|$|E
