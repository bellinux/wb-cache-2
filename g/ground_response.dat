The California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program was initiated in 1971 with the goal of maximizing the volume of data by furnishing and maintaining instruments at selected lifeline structures, buildings, and <b>ground</b> <b>response</b> stations.

The 1979 Imperial Valley and 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquakes were presented as gainful events that were recorded during that period, because both produced valuable data that increased knowledge of how moderate events affect buildings. The success of the Imperial Valley event was especially pronounced because of a recently constructed and fully instrumented government building that was shaken to the point of failure.|$|E

40|$|Vibration {{control of}} an optical table {{employing}} mechatronic inerter networks Fu-Cheng Wang and Sheng-Yao Wu This paper applies a newly developed mechatronic inerter network to suppress vibrations {{of a full}} optical table. Optical tables are normally applied to insulate precision machines from two types of disturbances: ground disturbances from the environment and load disturbances from the equipment. These two disturbances can be independently controlled by disturbance response decoupling (DRD) techniques. For example, we can isolate the ground disturbances by soft passive suspensions and improve the load responses by active control. However, the passive elements cannot be easily adjusted according to the operating conditions. Therefore, this paper applies mechatronic inerter networks to a full optical table, and optimizes the <b>ground</b> <b>responses</b> by connecting the networks to suitable electric circuits. We then apply DRD techniques to improve the load responses without influencing the <b>ground</b> <b>responses.</b> The designed mechatronic inerter networks and active controllers are implemented to a full optical table for experimental verification. Based on the results, the proposed mechatronic inerter networks and DRD structures are deemed effective in improving system responses...|$|R

Moreover, it may cause load redistribution and differential settlement {{in a pile}} group. In this paper, {{the construction of a}} water diversion tunnel with an outside diameter (D) of 5. 55 m constructed in Bangkok is reported. The tunnel was constructed in very stiff clay using an earth pressure balance shield with a cover-to-diameter ratio of 4. 5 and very close to a pile group. The pile group was located within a distance of 1 D from the tunnel springline. Tunneling induced <b>ground</b> <b>responses</b> were measured by using surface settlement points, extensometers and inclinometers. To investigate the influence of tunnelling on the pile group, a three-dimensional, elasto-plastic, coupled-consolidation numerical analysis was also conducted to simulate the pile group <b>responses.</b> Observed <b>ground</b> <b>responses</b> and computed changes of horizontal effective stress and excess pore water pressure around piles are reported.

40|$|This study {{proposes to}} use a method of nonlinear, nonstationary data {{processing}} and analysis, i. e., the Hilbert-Huang transform or HHT, to characterize and quantify the influences of nonlinear phenomena of soil layer(s) near the ground surface or simply site nonlinearity (exemplified as soil nonlinearity and/or liquefaction) in earthquake ground recordings. The paper first reviews the Fourier-based approach to characterizing the nonstationary features in the recordings and demonstrates the deficiencies for the nonstationarity caused by site nonlinearity. The paper then introduces the HHT method and offers the justifications for the HHT in addressing the issues of nonlinearity-related nonstationarity. With the use of hypothetic data and recordings from the 1964 Niigata and 2001 Nisqually earthquake and of Fourier-based approach as a reference, this study shows that the HHT-based approach is effective in characterizing site nonlinearity and quantifying the influences in seismic <b>ground</b> <b>responses.</b> Major {{results from this study}} are shown below. 1. The HHT-based site amplification is defined as the ratio of marginal Hilbert amplitude spectra, similar to the Fourier-based one that is the ratio of Fourier amplitude spectra. The HHT-based site amplification is effective in quantifying site nonlinearity in terms of frequency downshift in the low-frequency range and amplification-downshift factor in intermediate-frequency range. 2. Instantaneous damping, and Hilbert and marginal Hilbert damping spectra are defined in ways similar to instantaneous frequency, and Hilbert and marginal Hilbert amplitude spectra, respectively. Consequently, the HHT-based site damping is found as the difference of marginal Hilbert damping spectra, which can be used as an alternative, complementary index to measure the influences of site nonlinearity in seismic <b>ground</b> <b>responses.</b> ...|$|R
