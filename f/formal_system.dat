5|$|Another {{definition}} sees {{language as}} a <b>formal</b> <b>system</b> of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages {{can be described as}} closed structural systems consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings. This structuralist view of language was first introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure, and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{set about}} {{applying}} his business principles to his cabinet, putting {{his experience as}} both a corporate manager and rowing coach to use in a cabinet system that was orderly and practical. He implemented a <b>formal</b> <b>system</b> whereby a proper agenda for cabinet meetings would be formulated, and the minister responsible for each item would circulate papers to bring other members {{up to speed on}} the issue. His decision-making procedures ensured that his colleagues were informed and actively participated in decisions or if they disagreed, gave leave for cabinet members to absent themselves from meetings to preserve cabinet solidarity. In this respect Bruce earned the quick respect and approval of his colleagues, and in many respects came to dominate cabinet through his industriousness and knowledgability. Cabinet minister George Pearce would later conclude that Bruce was the best of the prime ministers that he served or opposed in his 38-year parliamentary career.|$|E
25|$|When a <b>formal</b> <b>system</b> {{is used to}} {{represent}} formal logic, only statement letters are represented directly.

25|$|Restrictions such {{as these}} are useful as a {{technique}} {{to reduce the number}} of inference rules or axiom schemas in deductive systems, which leads to shorter proofs of metalogical results. The cost of the restrictions is that it becomes more difficult to express natural-language statements in the <b>formal</b> <b>system</b> at hand, because the logical connectives used in the natural language statements must be replaced by their (longer) definitions in terms of the restricted collection of logical connectives. Similarly, derivations in the limited systems may be longer than derivations in systems that include additional connectives. There is thus a trade-off between the ease of working within the <b>formal</b> <b>system</b> and the ease of proving results about the <b>formal</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|Formal theorems {{consist of}} {{formulas}} {{of a formal}} language and the transformation rules of a <b>formal</b> <b>system.</b> Specifically, a formal theorem is always the last formula of a derivation in some <b>formal</b> <b>system</b> each formula {{of which is a}} logical consequence of the formulas that came before it in the derivation.

50|$|The basic {{objects of}} metalogical study are <b>formal</b> languages, <b>formal</b> <b>systems,</b> and their {{interpretation}}s.

25|$|Some logical {{systems do}} not have all four properties. As an example, Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorems show that {{sufficiently}} complex <b>formal</b> <b>systems</b> of arithmetic cannot be consistent and complete; however, first-order predicate logics not extended by specific axioms to be arithmetic <b>formal</b> <b>systems</b> with equality can be complete and consistent.|$|R
25|$|The theorem applies more {{generally}} to any sufficiently strong <b>formal</b> <b>system,</b> showing that {{truth in the}} standard model of the system cannot be defined within the system.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} a formal theorem is {{fundamentally}} syntactic, {{in contrast to the}} notion of a true proposition, which introduces semantics. Different deductive systems can yield other interpretations, depending on the presumptions of the derivation rules (i.e. belief, justification or other modalities). The soundness of a <b>formal</b> <b>system</b> depends on whether or not all of its theorems are also validities. A validity is a formula that is true under any possible interpretation, e.g. in classical propositional logic validities are tautologies. A <b>formal</b> <b>system</b> is considered semantically complete when all of its tautologies are also theorems.|$|E

25|$|Certain computable ordinals are {{so large}} that while they can be given by a certain ordinal {{notation}} o, a given <b>formal</b> <b>system</b> might not be sufficiently powerful to show that o is, indeed, an ordinal notation: the system does not show transfinite induction for such large ordinals.|$|E

25|$|What makes formal theorems {{useful and}} of {{interest}} {{is that they can}} be interpreted as true propositions and their derivations may be interpreted as a proof of the truth of the resulting expression.
