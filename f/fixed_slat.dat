5000|$|In 1935, the RLM (Reichsluftfahrtministerium, Reich Aviation Ministry) invited several {{aviation}} {{companies to}} submit design proposals that would {{compete for the}} production contract for a new Luftwaffe aircraft design suitable for liaison, army co-operation (today called forward air control), and medical evacuation. This resulted in the Messerschmitt Bf 163 and Siebel Si 201 competing against the Fieseler firm's entry. Conceived by chief designer Reinhold Mewes and technical director Erich Bachem, Fieseler's design had a far better short {{take off and landing}} ("STOL") performance. A <b>fixed</b> <b>slat</b> ran along {{the entire length of the}} leading edge of the long wings, while a hinged and slotted set of control surfaces ran along the entire length of trailing edge. This was inspired by earlier 1930s Junkers Doppelflügel, [...] "double-wing" [...] aircraft wing control surface design concepts. For the Fi 156, this setup along each wing panel's trailing edge was split nearly 50/50 between the inboard-located flaps and outboard-located ailerons, which themselves included trim tab devices over half of each aileron's trailing edge length. A design feature rare for land-based aircraft enabled the wings on the Storch to be folded back along the fuselage in a manner similar to the wings of the US Navy's Grumman F4F Wildcat fighter. This allowed the aircraft to be carried on a trailer or even towed slowly behind a vehicle. The primary hinge for the folding wing was located in the wing root, where the rear wing spar met the cabin. The long legs of the main landing gear contained oil-and-spring shock absorbers that had a travel of 40 cm (15-3/4 inches), allowing the aircraft to land on comparatively rough and uneven surfaces - this was combined with a [...] "pre-travel" [...] distance of 20 cm, before the oleos began damping the landing gear shock. In flight, the main landing gear legs hung down, giving the aircraft the appearance of a long-legged, big-winged bird, hence its nickname, Storch. With its very low landing speed the Storch often appeared to land vertically, or even backwards, in strong winds from directly ahead.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—An active slat is {{developed}} {{to increase the}} lift and delay the separation for a DU 96 -W 180 airfoil. The active slat is a <b>fixed</b> <b>slat</b> that can be closed, fully opened or intermittently opened by a rotating vane depending on the need. Experimental {{results show that the}} active slat has reduced the mean pressure and increased the mean velocity on the suction side of the airfoil for all positive angles of attack, indicating an increase of lift. The experimental data and numerical simulations also show that the direction of actuator vane rotation can influence the mixing of the flow streams on the suction side and hence influence the aerodynamic performance. Keywords—Active slat, flow control. I...|$|E
40|$|A design {{technique}} for analytically generating {{a leading edge}} slat which will induce the modulating field required to match a specified pressure distribution on the nose of an elliptical airfoil was developed. This planar potential flow solution can be readily generalized {{to the design of}} slats to prevent boundary-layer separation at the nose of an arbitrary airfoil. The technique is described as semi-inverse because the singularity representation for the slat is constrained so that only realistic slat shapes will be generated. The elliptical airfoil is mapped to a half-plane. In this domain, the slat is represented by a finite series of distributed singularities on an inclined chord line which is placed along a zero order nose flow streamline. These distributed singularities correspond to the singular and regular camber and thickness modes of thin airfoil theory. A suitable slat chord location in the half-plane is selected by examination of the distribution of the specified modulating velocity. For a <b>fixed</b> <b>slat</b> location, the slat-induced velocity field can be written explicitly in terms of the unknown series coefficients. A least squares matching to the specified modulating field is used to select the coefficients. The velocity distribution along the chord line is integrated to determine the slat surface streamlines which are then transformed back to the ellipse plane. The digital computer program for the semi-inverse solution can be executed rapidly. Once an appropriate slat chord location in the half-plane has been selected, an accurate matching of the specified pressure distribution on the airfoil can be achieved. The airfoil nose flow calculated by the semi-inverse solution agrees very closely with the flow computed by the Douglas-Neumann direct solution for the same slat geometry. The airfoil nose flow is very sensitive to the distribution of camber and thickness along the chord line. In some test cases, a modified semi-inverse solution was required in which the minimum acceptable slat thickness was prescribed and a restricted inversion solution was conducted to select the camber mode coefficients required to match the specified modulating field. For a thin airfoil with a severe nose suction peak, a small, thin, highly-cambered slat which is located close to the airfoil nose is desirable...|$|E

50|$|Plane {{was built}} for landing on {{unprepared}} fields and its STOL characteristics include leading edge <b>fixed</b> <b>slats,</b> flaps and drooping ailerons. The cockpit is equipped with two flight controls. The right front and rear seats in the older version of the plane were able to accommodate two stretchers. The aircraft had floats to land on water, but {{they could have been}} exchanged for snow skis. 130 UTVA-66 aircraft were manufactured. The last aircraft were withdrawn from military service in 1999.|$|R
50|$|Slats, {{also known}} as leading edge devices, are {{extensions}} {{to the front of}} a wing for lift augmentation, and are intended to reduce the stalling speed by altering the airflow over the wing. <b>Slats</b> may be <b>fixed</b> or retractable - <b>fixed</b> <b>slats</b> (e.g. as on the Fieseler Fi 156 Storch) give excellent slow speed and STOL capabilities, but compromise higher speed performance. Retractable slats, as seen on most airliners, provide reduced stalling speed for take-off and landing, but are retracted for cruising.|$|R
25|$|The {{prototype}} {{was built}} and first flown in early 1936 (registration SP-AXY), {{funded by the}} Polish division of Osram factory. The plane did not appear a successful design, though. Test revealed lack of directional stability, therefore its rudder was much enlarged, the wings were fitted with <b>fixed</b> <b>slats</b> and a windshield was redesigned. It did not improve the situation much, and in 1937-1938 the prototype was rebuilt and fitted with stronger 60hp Avia 3 engine in a lengthened nose, while the vertical stabilizer and rudder were made smaller. Most significant feature became a front windshield with a negative slope.|$|R
60|$|Consequently {{the plan}} of reflectors was discarded, and Roland {{determined}} that {{the right thing to}} do was to take Margaret into his confidence and explain to her why he and she should not stand together and look down the course of the Artesian ray. She scolded him for not telling her all this before, and a permanent screen was erected around the spot on which the ray was intended to work, formed of Venetian blinds with <b>fixed</b> <b>slats,</b> so that the person inside could readily talk and consult with others outside without being seen by them.|$|R
50|$|The Letov Š-39 was a sport {{aircraft}} {{produced in}} Czechoslovakia during the 1930s. It was a conventional, parasol-wing monoplane with fixed tailskid undercarriage, and seating {{for the pilot}} and passenger in tandem, open cockpits. Because the cabane struts were very short, and the wing therefore placed {{very close to the}} top of the fuselage, the cockpits had the unusual arrangement of the passenger's being in front of the wing while the pilot's was behind it. The outer half of each wing was fitted with <b>fixed</b> <b>slats</b> along the leading edge. An initial batch of 23 machines was built for use by Czech aeroclubs. These were followed by batches of aircraft with alternative powerplants.|$|R
5000|$|The {{handling}} {{characteristics of the}} Seamew were poor. The prototypes were heavily modified with <b>fixed</b> leading-edge <b>slats,</b> slots added in the trailing-edge flaps, alterations to the ailerons and slats added to the tailplane roots. Although something of an improvement over the initial models, the handling was never wholly satisfactory. Arthur Pearcy wrote [...] "only Short Brothers' test pilot Wally Runciman seemed able to outwit its vicious tendencies and exploit its latent manoeuvrability to the limit." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the extreme}} tail unit, the tail wheel was {{retractable}} and {{had its own}} folding doors. The tip or end of the fuselage could be removed to allow quick access for mechanics to enter the tail section and repair the jack mechanism which controlled the tail plane incidence and pivot. The tail incidence was automatically changed when the landing flaps were lowered, {{or it could be}} adjusted manually.This tip would be replaced by dive brakes in the event the Dornier was required to attack precision targets.The horizontal stabilizer surfaces were conventional, as part of a twin tail empennage with [...] "endplate" [...] vertical fin/rudder units, as on the previous production Do 17 airframes. The rudder contained a balance tab while the elevators contained an elevator balance tab and an automatic dive pull-out tab, {{in the event of a}} dive-bombing mission. The stabilisers were fitted with <b>fixed</b> <b>slats,</b> with the trailing edges of the slats positioned inside of the fins. The rudders had very narrow horn balances (the amount of rudder or active control surface forward of the rudder-stabilizer hinge) which allowed for better balance, and the trimming tabs extended the full length of the stabilizers trailing edges. The stabilizers also had the Handley-Page leading edge slots installed on the inboard side.|$|R
5000|$|Fi 156 B: Fitted with a {{new system}} which could retract the {{normally}} <b>fixed</b> leading edge <b>slats</b> and {{had a number of}} minor aerodynamic cleanups, boosting the speed to 208 km/h (130 mph). The Luftwaffe did not consider such a small difference to be important and the Fi-156 B was not produced.|$|R
50|$|One way {{to reduce}} the cruise drag of slots is to make them able to be closed. This {{arrangement}} is known as leading edge slats. Aerodynamically, slats work {{in the same way as}} <b>fixed</b> slots but <b>slats</b> can be retracted at higher speeds when they are not needed. Slats, in turn, are heavier and more complex than slots.|$|R
50|$|In {{aircraft}} design and aerospace engineering, a high-lift device is a component or mechanism on an aircraft's wing {{that increases the}} amount of lift produced by the wing. The device may be a fixed component, or a movable mechanism which is deployed when required. Common movable high-lift devices include wing flaps and <b>slats.</b> <b>Fixed</b> devices include leading edge root extensions and boundary layer control systems, which are less commonly used.|$|R
2500|$|The X-48B first flew on July 20, 2007, {{reaching}} {{an altitude of}} 7,500ft (2,286 m); the flight lasting 31 minutes. [...] The remotely piloted aircraft was successfully stalled {{for the first time}} on September 4, 2008, with <b>fixed</b> leading edge <b>slats,</b> a forward center of gravity, and 23-degree angle of attack (2° beyond the maximum coefficient of lift). [...] Stall testing was repeated on September 11 with a NASA pilot at the console.|$|R
25|$|The Be-103 {{features}} include an advanced, blended wing, swept at 22°, with -long <b>fixed</b> leading edge <b>slats,</b> trailing-link main landing gear, and three-bladed MT-12 reverse pitch propellers. Fuel {{is stored in}} the wet wings. The aircraft is built from aluminum-lithium alloy with titanium used in high-stress areas. A 30-parameter, five-hour flight data recorder, engine fire-detection systems and an ice detector are also standard, as are hydraulic brakes. However, unlike most modern aircraft, the Be-103 is not equipped with wing flaps.|$|R
50|$|The first {{drawings}} for the Pilatus P-5 {{were made in}} 1951. The client was the Federal Military Department (EMD). The main purpose for the P-5 was for artillery observation. It was a single-engine, two-seat high-wing monoplane with fixed wheels. The aircraft frame {{was intended to be}} built out of tubular steel and skinned with metal. The main wings and tail were intended to be made from an alloy, not steel. This aircraft had <b>fixed</b> wing with <b>slats</b> and flaps fitted on to them. The pilot and observer were seated in a generously glazed cabin that had exceptionally good visibility in all directions. This view was due mainly to the curved sides which allowed the aircrew to look almost straight down. This P-5 design was abandoned in 1951 and no prototype aircraft were ever built.|$|R
40|$|Air supply {{diffusers}} used in {{air-conditioning systems}} can be classified as ceiling diffusers, side-wall diffusers, floor diffusers, jet nozzles, and low velocity displacement diffusers. <b>Fixed</b> or adjustable <b>slats</b> are usually used to control airflow directions. Recently, swirling vanes are used in floor diffusers to create swirling outflow jet, so that more rapid mixing with ambient air can be achieved. In this paper we used the latest CFD technique to investigate the airflow pattern and the impact on thermal comfort in the near nozzle region of a floor-level swirl-type diffuser. The preliminary simulation results indicate that re-circulation region in the near nozzle can only be realistically predicted by including the swirling devices in the calculation domain. The results will be further validated with experiments, and the method {{is expected to be}} used to help optimize diffuser designs...|$|R
50|$|On 15 January 1943, the {{prototype}} CA-4, A23-1001, crashed {{on a test}} flight to assess powerplant performance and evaluate aerodynamic effects of a new <b>fixed</b> leading edge <b>slat.</b> During the return to the CAC airfield at Fisherman's Bend, the pilot, Squadron Leader Jim Harper, had detected a fuel leak in the port Pratt & Whitney R-1830 engine. As the problem worsened he attempted {{to shut down the}} engine, feathering the propeller; however, the actuation of the feathering switch caused an explosion and uncontrollable fire. The three man crew subsequently attempted evacuation at 1000 ft, yet only Harper succeeded in parachuting free, while the CAC test pilot Jim Carter and power plant group engineer Lionel Dudgeon were both killed. The airframe subsequently impacted 3 mi south-west of Kilmore, Victoria. The wreckage was recovered and used for components.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design that}} emerged, while superficially {{similar to the}} Wirraway, was really a new type that used some Wirraway {{components}} rather than a conversion. The only major components used in both types without alteration were the tail group and the landing gear. The fuselage was completely new, with a [...] hopper installed between the engine and the high-mounted single-seat cockpit. The Wirraway wing was substantially altered {{for use in the}} Ceres. The outer wing panels had slotted trailing-edge flaps and <b>fixed</b> leading edge <b>slats,</b> while the centre-section was substantially altered to accommodate the hopper, the higher weights of the Ceres, the different flaps (the Wirraway had split flaps) and the new type's fixed landing gear with CAC Mustang main wheels as opposed to the Wirraway's retractable gear (the same landing gear legs were used however). The increase in wingspan and wing area of the Ceres compared to the Wirraway was also incorporated in the centre-section, and the end result was an aircraft with much more docile stalling characteristics than those of the Wirraway. The engine was the same type, a Pratt & Whitney R-1340, but altered so that it was direct-drive instead of geared as on the Wirraway. The three-bladed variable-pitch propeller was also different, being of wider chord and smaller diameter compared to the Wirraway's to suit the Ceres' different operating regime and the direct-drive engine.|$|R
40|$|Among {{the various}} {{building}} envelope elements, the glass area {{takes up the}} largest portion in the office building design. However, a large area of glass can cause problems such as excessive solar radiation, thermal comfort, and glare. Thus {{it is important to}} install the glass area to an appropriate level, and control solar radiation and inflow of daylight with blind devices. This study aims to improve the visual performance of the work plane through the automatic control of the venetian blinds. A total of eight kinds of control strategies were chosen; Case 1 does not control the blinds, Case 2 with the blind <b>slats</b> <b>fixed</b> at the angle of 0 degree, Case 3 to 6 using the existing blind control programs, and Case 7 and 8 with improved blind control. Case 3 with 90 degrees had the best energy performance, but the average indoor illuminance was 113 lux, which is below the standards. Cases 4 and 5 showed higher levels of interior daylight illuminance with the average of 281 lux and 403 lux respectively. However, the fixed angles may have difficulties controlling excessive direct sunlight coming into the room and may cause glare. Cases 6 and 7 used sun tracking angle control and cut-off angle control, and the average interior illuminance was measured 250 lux and 385 lux respectively. Case 8 used the cut-off angle control in an hourly manner, satisfying the standard illuminance of 400 lux with an average interior illuminance of 561 lux. It was evaluated to be the best method to control direct solar radiation and to guarantee proper level of interior illumination...|$|R
5000|$|The Tu-144 {{prototype}} was {{a full-scale}} demonstrator aircraft {{with the very}} different production aircraft being developed in parallel. While both Concorde and the Tu-144 prototype had ogival delta wings, the Tu-144's wing lacked Concorde's conical camber. Production Tu-144s replaced this wing with a double delta wing including spanwise and chordwise camber. They also added two small retractable surfaces called Moustache canard, with <b>fixed</b> double-slotted LE <b>slats</b> and retractable double-slotted flaps. These were fitted just behind the cockpit and increased lift at low speeds.Moving the elevons downward in a delta-wing aircraft increases the lift (force), but also pitches its nose downward. The canards cancel out this nose-downwards moment, thus reducing the landing speed of the production Tu-144s to 315 - 333 km/h, still faster than that of Concorde. The NASA study lists final approach speeds during Tu-144LL test flights as 315 - 335 km/h. An FAA circular lists Tu-144S approach speed as 329 km/h, as opposed to Concorde's approach speed of 300 km/h, based on the characteristics declared by the manufacturers to Western regulatory bodies. It is open to argument how stable the Tu-144S was at the listed airspeed. In any event, when NASA subcontracted Tupolev bureau in the 1990s to convert one of the remaining Tu-144D to a Tu-144LL standard, the procedure set by Tupolev for landing defined the Tu-144LL [...] "final approach speed... {{on the order of}} 360 km/h depending on fuel weight." [...] Brian Calvert, Concorde's technical flight manager and its first commercial pilot in command for several inaugural flights, cites final approach speed of a typical Concorde landing to be 287 - 296 km/h. The lower landing speed compared to Tu-144 is due to Concorde's more refined design of the wing profile that provides higher lift at low speeds without degrading supersonic cruise performance - a feature often mentioned in Western publications on Concorde and acknowledged by Tupolev designers as well.|$|R
