40|$|Farm {{viability}} poses a grave {{challenge to}} the sustainability of agriculture and food systems: the number of acres in production continues to decline as the majority of farms earn negative net income. Two related and often overlapping marketing strategies, (i) locally grown foods and (ii) distribution at farmers markets, can directly enhance <b>food</b> system <b>sustainability</b> by improving farm profitability and long-term viability, as well as contributing to an array of ancillary benefits. We present results of a representative Michigan telephone survey, which measured consumers’ perceptions and behaviors around local foods and farmers markets. We discuss the implications of our findings on greater farm profitability. We conclude with suggestions for future research to enhance the contributions of locally grown foods and farmers markets to overall <b>food</b> system <b>sustainability.</b> Michigan; Probit analysis; marketing strategies...|$|R

5000|$|The United Kingdom's {{delegate}} {{responded to}} the comments made by Mauritius. He said that [...] "the British government has {{no doubt that the}} sovereignty of the Chagos as has been British since the nineteenth century. No international tribunal, including to Annex 7 of the Law of the Sea has ever doubted the islands' sovereignty. The United Kingdom sees Mauritius sovereignty and will cede the island when it is no longer needed for defense. In the meantime, the United Kingdom will decide when do so. Defense is used to counter regional threats in terrorism and piracy. Arbitration awarded does not protect maritime use and with no view on the MPA to maintain Indian Ocean fish stocks and maintain <b>food</b> <b>sustainability.</b> In conclusion, the United Kingdom should maintain discourse with Mauritius and both countries should enter into discussion under the sovereignty umbrella. The United Kingdom attempts discourse and enters into bilateral discussions and looks forward to working with Mauritius to ensure all aspects of the MPA" [...] are maintained.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{significant}} {{advantage of}} IQF technology {{is its ability}} to separate the products during the freezing process, which results in products of higher quality when compared to those which are block frozen for example. This advantage is also important for <b>food</b> <b>sustainability</b> as it allows the defrost and use of the exact needed quantity as opposed to defrosting a bigger block and dispose of the unneeded or unused portion. There is a range of IQF technologies, but the main concept is to transport the product into the freezer {{with the help of a}} processing line belt or infeed shaker. Inside the freezer the product travels through the freezing zone and comes out on the other side. The transportation of the product inside the freezer can be achieved through different technologies depending on the IQF freezer’s brand. There are solutions based on transportation belts inside the freezer which is similar to a conveyor belt. Other latest innovations include bed plates on which the product lands and an asymmetrical movement is used for making the product advance by itself in the freezer.|$|E
50|$|As a Hazon-run {{organization}} {{emphasizing the}} spiritual and transformative properties of nature immersion, Isabella Freedman is committed to environmentally conscious facility management {{and the promotion of}} environmental stewardship. In addition to the many practices that allow Isabella Freedman to conserve energy and water, limit its use of toxic chemicals, and reduce waste (such as its campus-wide composting system), Isabella Freedman offers sustainability tours of its campus and environmentally-focused educational workshops. The Isabella Freedman Farm encompasses 10 acres of fields, orchards, and pasture and grows over forty varieties of vegetables, twenty five varieties of cut flowers, and a diverse mix of herbs and fruits. The herbs, flowers, and produce provide the kitchen with local, seasonal ingredients and are also sold through the farm's CSA program. The farm is certified organic, and the Adamah fellows who maintain it practice sustainable growing methods such as crop rotation, cover cropping, composting, drip irrigation, creating habitat for pollinators, and growing diverse mixes of annual and perennial flowers. Isabella Freedman's trip of goats aid in farm maintenance and provide the milk for its cheese-making workshops, and its flock of chickens help break down the compost heap and provide eggs for the dining hall. Its emphasis on <b>food</b> <b>sustainability</b> allows Isabella Freedman to serve as one of the main bases for the growing JOFEE (Jewish Outdoor Food, farming, and Environmental Education) movement, a field Hazon and other Jewish environmental organizations are continuing to develop.|$|E
5000|$|As a Miss Earth delegate, an {{environmental}} advocacy is a must. When the organization asked what her advocacy is, she answered Biodiversity. For Nicolle, [...] "Biodiversity {{refers to the}} variety of life on Earth and the many ecosystems that harbor those organisms." [...] She then added that, [...] "In a rich diverse ecosystem, there is a habitat that creates natural sustainability for all life making it stronger and more able to recover from any disasters. As the dominant species, we {{have the responsibility to}} ensure suitable environments for all organisms by consciously measuring our activities and the effects they cause. Deforestation for food crops {{is one of the leading}} causes of habitat destruction and animal endangerment. The cultivation of crops such as Palm Oil has consumed Indonesia and Malaysia’s rain forests, significantly shrinking the homes of the now endangered species of the orangutan and the Asian rhinoceros, as well as impacting many plants, herbs and flowers. It has also increased the amount of greenhouse gases and has commenced a cycle of soil depletion in that territory. Deforestation specifically as it relates to biodiversity encompasses a multitude of environmental problems and raises the need for <b>food</b> <b>sustainability</b> movements and the development of the ‘New Economy’ that will reduce the need for so many clearings. Ultimately, the importance of biodiversity as a global issue is as much {{an environmental}} piece as it is a social justice problem that I feel must be strongly pursued." ...|$|E
