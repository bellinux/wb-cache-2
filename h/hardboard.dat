25|$|Most {{workbenches}} {{are made}} from solid wood; the most expensive and desirable are made of solid hardwood. Benches may also be made from plywood and Masonite or <b>hardboard,</b> and bases of treated pine and even steel. There are trade offs with the choice of construction material. Solid wood has many advantages including strength, workability, appearance. A plywood or <b>hardboard</b> bench top {{has the advantage of}} being stable, relatively inexpensive, and in some ways it's easier to work with - particularly for a woodworker who doesn't yet have hand tools. The practical drawbacks of a plywood or composite bench top are that they don't hold their corners and edges well, and they can't be resurfaced with a plane - something that is needed from time to time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a {{two-phase}} algorithm {{was developed}} for the cutting sequencing problems in a modular manufacturing system. This system has a level of flexibility {{that depends on the}} cutting phase of raw material. This paper focuses primarily on the work station. In {{the first phase of the}} algorithm, an integer linear programming model is used to determine the number of <b>hardboards</b> that will be cut. The model was tested with two different objective functions which are to minimize waste and to minimize the number of <b>hardboards</b> used. In the second phase, a heuristic scheduling was developed to determine the pattern of cutting, by considering the due date and the number of customer demand. This algorithm is further implemented in a furniture manufacturer that operates using the make-to-order basis.

500|$|His {{first job}} that {{involved}} ladders {{was given to}} him while he still worked as a joiner. [...] He was asked to point a garden wall and then the gable end of the customer's house. [...] He used several short ladders, lashed together with rope and <b>hardboard.</b> [...] This gave Dibnah valuable experience and his employer expanded the business to include property repairs. [...] Aged about 17–18 he climbed the [...] chimney at Barrow Bridge, for a 10shilling bet. During the night he took two Union flags {{to the top and}} secured each to the lightning conductors there. The Bolton Evening News reported the incident, with a photograph of Dibnah's feat, but attributed it to the activities of students from Manchester University. At about the same time, Dibnah decided to replace the chimney stack at his mother's house on Alfred Street with one of his own design, as his mother used only one fireplace—leaving four of the five chimney pots redundant. As the single opening {{at the top of the}} new stack was only about [...] wide, the flue needed regular maintenance. On one occasion, he was cleaning the flue using a sack of bricks tied to a rope when the sack ripped open, breaking several lead pipes and flooding his mother's kitchen. After the death of his mother, the house was sold and the council placed a preservation order on the chimney, which remains to this day.|$|E

25|$|A {{flush door}} is a {{completely}} smooth door, having plywood or MDF fixed over a light timber frame, the hollow parts of which are often filled with a cardboard core material. Skins can also be made out of <b>hardboards,</b> {{the first of which}} was invented by William H Mason in 1924. Called Masonite, its construction involved pressing and steaming wood chips into boards. Flush doors are most commonly employed in the interior of a dwelling, although slightly more substantial versions are occasionally used as exterior doors, especially within hotels and other buildings containing many independent dwellings.|$|R
40|$|<b>Hardboards</b> (HBs) (wet-process {{high-density}} fibreboards) {{were made}} in an industrial trial using a binder system consisting of cationic mimosa tannin and laccase or just cationic tannin without any thermosetting adhesive. The boards displayed superior mechanical strength compared to reference boards made with phenol–formaldehyde, easily exceeding the European standards for general-purpose HBs. The thickness swell {{of most of the}} boards was slightly greater than the standards would allow, so some optimisation is required in this area. The improved board properties appear to be mainly associated with ionic interactions involving quaternary amino groups in cationic tannin and negatively charged wood fibres rather than to cross-linking of fibres via laccase-assisted formation and coupling of radicals in tannin and fibre lignin...|$|R

50|$|The farmer’s son Eduardo Saidi Tingatinga made {{a living}} in Daressalam by {{painting}} memories of his homeland. Using bicycle paint on 60x60cm <b>hardboards</b> he painted scenes of his village and surrounding animals and plants. Primarily assisted by his cousin January Linda, he sold the paintings at the local market. Later Linda took up painting himself. In 1971 Scandinavian development workers organized an exhibition of both Linda and Tingatinga in the National Museum of Daressalam. The exhibition was such a success that it inspired {{a new generation of}} young artists, thus allowing Tingatinga’s art to establish a whole artistic movement of its own, the Tingatinga-school.The exhibition in Freiberg displays mostly works from the early period of this trend in art, among those 13 works by Tingatinga himself.|$|R
50|$|Although the internationally {{acclaimed}} Tanzanian artist George Lilanga was not {{a student}} of the Tingatinga school, nor a member of the Tingatinga Society, he's known to have frequented Tingatinga artists, and some influence of Tingatinga is evident in his work, for what concerns painting (an art form that Lilanga approached in 1974). This influence has been recognized by Lilanga himself in an interview with Kenji Shiraishi, specifically in reference to the use of enamel paint and square <b>hardboards.</b> Besides using materials and techniques originally adopted by Tingatinga painters, Lilanga's art resembles Tingatinga also in its use of vibrant colors and its composition style, that shares the same horror vacui of Tingatinga art. It has been suggested that Lilanga (who was originally a sculptor) actually learned to paint from Tingatinga painters such as Noel Kapanda and later Mchimbi Halfani, who collaborated with him. The collaboration between Lilanga and Kapanda lasted several years.|$|R
40|$|This review {{considers}} the potential {{and challenges of}} using agro-based oil palm biomasses, including the trunk, frond, empty fruit bunch, and palm press fiber biocomposites, for furniture applications.

40|$|A new {{technique}} {{was developed to}} make highly loaded (up to 95 %) formaldehyde free natural fiber boards. The purpose of the paper is to report a broad study on 85 % kenaf boards using linear thermoplastic polymers as the binder in preparing the boards to determine if these materials have potential in commercial applications by comparing them to other commercial materials. In these materials, linear thermoplastic polymer chains act as an adhesive and the product resembles a typical wood based panel (e. g., phenol formaldehyde fiber board). The process involved the use of small amount of glycerine in the fiber to enhance processibility in a thermo-kinetic mixer followed by hot pressing. In this paper, we report the properties of 85 % by weight kenaf fiber boards using polypropylene as the adhesive. A maleated polypropylene was used to improve the adhesion and stress transfer between the adhesive and kenaf fiber. The addition of 2 % by weight of glycerine based on the dry weight of kenaf fiber resulted in the best properties of the boards. Differential scanning calorimetric studies suggested that the glycerine had a {{little effect on the}} percent crystallinity of the matrix. Dynamic mechanical tests of the 85 % boards showed some differences compared to conventional 60 % by weight kenaf-PP composites. The 85 % kenaf boards had a flexural strength of 75 MPa and a flexural modulus of 6. 8 GPa with a specific gravity of 1. 24. These properties are comparable to standard formaldehyde free high density <b>hardboards</b> with flexural strengths of 48. 3 MPa and flexural modulus of 5. 5 GPa, and a specific gravity of 1. 28.

Accordingly, in this paper, we compared the properties of fiberboard producted from the juvenile wood with that from the mature wood, with a view to investigating on the characteristics of juvenile wood as a material of hard board industry. The test materials were taken from five portions of a 55 -year-old SUGI (Cryptomeria japonica D.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} studies with ultrasonic nondestructive testing and wood fiber composites. The problem {{of the study was}} to ascertain whether ultrasonic nondestructive testing can be used in place of destructive testing to obtain the modulus of elasticity (MOE) of the wood/agricultural material with comparable results. The uniqueness of this research is that it addressed the type of content (cornstalks and switchgrass) being used with the wood fibers and the type of adhesives (soybean-based) associated with the production of these composite materials;Two research questions were addressed in the study. The major objective was to determine if one can predict the destructive test MOE value based on the nondestructive test MOE value. The population of the study was wood/agricultural fiberboards made from wood fibers, cornstalks, and switchgrass bonded together with soybean-based, urea-formaldehyde, and phenol-formaldehyde adhesives;Correlational analysis was used to determine if there was a relationship between the two tests. Regression analysis was performed to determine a prediction equation for the destructive test MOE value. Data were collected on both procedures using ultrasonic nondestructing testing and 3 -point destructive testing;The results produced a simple linear regression model for this study which was adequate in the prediction of destructive MOE values if the nondestructive MOE value is known. An approximation very close to the entire error in the model equation was explained from the destructive test MOE values for the composites. The nondestructive MOE values used to produce a linear regression model explained 83 % of the variability in the destructive test MOE values. The study also showed that, for the particular destructive test values obtained with the equipment used, the model associated with the study is as good as it could be due to the variability in the results from the destructive tests;In this study, an ultrasonic signal was used to determine the MOE values on nondestructive tests.
