There were {{a considerable number of}} disagreements over mining claims and property rights, which Earp had a part in. On March 28, several feet of snow were still on the ground. Bill Buzzard, a miner of dubious reputation, began constructing a building when one of Wyatt's partners, Jack Enright, tried to stop the construction. Enright claimed the building was on part of his property. Words were exchanged and Buzzard reached for his Winchester. He fired several shots at Enright and a skirmish developed. Allies of both sides quickly took defensive positions between snowbanks and began shooting at one another. <b>Deputy</b> <b>Sheriff</b> Wyatt Earp and his brother James stepped {{into the middle of the}} fray and helped peacefully resolve the dispute before anyone was seriously hurt.

Several counties have moved away from these practices. Patrol cars in these counties have different vehicle markings, and <b>deputy</b> <b>sheriffs</b> wear different uniforms. Some examples are Ulster County, which has dark gray uniforms similar to the New York State Police; and Warren County, whose <b>deputy</b> <b>sheriffs</b> wear tan shirts with dark brown pants. Dutchess County <b>Deputy</b> <b>Sheriffs</b> wear tactical Class B uniforms consisting of black shirts and black pants and a Class A uniform with light blue shirts with darker blue pants. In Suffolk County, the sheriff vehicles are black and white (similar to the police/sheriff vehicle scheme used in California).
