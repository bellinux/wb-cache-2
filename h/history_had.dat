5|$|Much of {{this period}} {{represented}} a high point in Galveston's economy. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the open era or the wide-open era because the business owners and the community made little effort to hide the illegal vice activities. The tourist industry spawned by the illegal businesses helped to offset Galveston's decline as a commercial and shipping center following a devastating hurricane in 1900. However, crackdowns against gambling and prostitution in Texas during the mid-20th century made these businesses increasingly difficult to sustain. By the 1950s, this era of Galveston's <b>history</b> <b>had</b> ended.|$|E
50|$|Design <b>history</b> <b>has</b> had to {{incorporate}} {{criticism of the}} 'heroic' structure of its discipline, {{in response to the}} establishment of material culture, much as art <b>history</b> <b>has</b> had to respond to visual culture, (although visual culture has been able to broaden the subject area of art history through the incorporation of the televisual, film and new media). Design <b>history</b> <b>has</b> done this by shifting its focus towards the acts of production and consumption.|$|R

5|$|Never {{before in}} Australian <b>history</b> <b>had</b> so many {{high-profile}} public servants, dignitaries and diplomats {{died in a}} single tragedy. Many passengers who died were Darwin residents and news of the tragedy severely affected the small community, reportedly taking several years to recover.

5|$|The FA Cup win in 1973 {{meant that}} Sunderland, {{for the first}} time in their <b>history,</b> <b>had</b> {{qualified}} for a European competition, in this case the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. They were first drawn against Hungarian side Vasas Budapest, who they beat 3–0 on aggregate. In the next round Sunderland were drawn against Sporting Lisbon. They won the first leg 2–1 at Roker Park, but in the return leg in Lisbon they were beaten 2–0, and were thus knocked out of the competition in the second round.|$|E
5|$|After Ford {{left the}} White House in January 1977, the former President privately {{justified}} his pardon of Nixon by carrying {{in his wallet}} {{a portion of the}} text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt. In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that <b>history</b> <b>had</b> proved Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E

On July 19, he led off {{the bottom of the}} first inning with a home run, and 12 innings later he broke a 3–3 tie with a two-run, walk-off home run. Only four times before in major league <b>history</b> <b>had</b> the same batter led off the bottom of the first inning with a home run, and ended the game with another homer.

5|$|The 2013 season saw new staff, a new coach, Trent Robinson, {{and several}} new players, {{including}} big signings Michael Jennings, James Maloney, Luke O'Donnell and Sonny Bill Williams, {{arrive at the}} club. This culminated in the Roosters finishing the 2013 season with a 24–12 win over the South Sydney Rabbitohs, securing the minor premiership for the 2013 season and were the NRL's best attacking and defensive team. The Roosters defeated the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles 4–0, in week one of the finals, earning a week's rest. The Roosters defeated the Newcastle Knights 40–14 in week three of the NRL finals, progressing to the 2013 NRL grand final, facing the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, winning 26–18. It was a great comeback by the Roosters, down by 10 {{points in the second}} half they went on to score three consecutive tries to seal the win and their 13th premiership. They then {{went on to win the}} 2014 World Club Challenge against Wigan 36–14 to claim the treble of club titles.
