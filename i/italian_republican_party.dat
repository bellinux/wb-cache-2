25|$|Raffaele Rossetti (12 July 1881 – 24 December 1951) was an Italian {{engineer}} and military naval officer who sank the main battleship of the Austro-Hungarian Empire {{at the end}} of World War I. He was also a politician of the <b>Italian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
25|$|Disillusioned by {{the spread}} of {{violence}} in Sicily, to which he believed the Socialist party’s discourse of class struggle had contributed, Colajanni reverted in 1894 to his original republicanism. On April 12, 1895, he {{took part in the}} founding congress of the <b>Italian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> (Partito Repubblicano Italiano).|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{the general}} term 'liberalism' will almost always refer to modern liberalism, a more social variant of {{classical}} liberalism. In Europe, this social liberalism {{is closer to}} European Social democracy although the original form is advocated by some liberal parties in Europe as well, as with the Beveridge Group faction within the Liberal Democrats (United Kingdom), Liberals (Sweden), Danish Social Liberal Party, the Democratic Movement (France), the <b>Italian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> or the Free Democratic Party of Germany, for example.|$|E
5000|$|Having {{embarked}} in {{a journalistic}} career {{at an early}} age, he was a foreign and cultural editor of the Voce Repubblicana, the <b>Italian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party’s</b> daily, and later collaborated with important Italian titles such as l’Astrolabio, directed by Ferruccio Parri, {{the first president of}} the Italian government council after World War II, l’Espresso, the Fiera Letteraria, l’Europeo, Aut and Mondo Nuovo, {{as well as with the}} RAI (the national broadcasting company) [...] He has been a director of Lazio, ieri oggi e domani, the journal of the Placido Martini Institute of Economic and Social Research.|$|R
50|$|The Congress of Verona in November 1943 was {{the only}} {{congress}} of the <b>Italian</b> <b>Republican</b> Fascist <b>Party,</b> the successor of the National Fascist Party. At the time, the <b>Republican</b> Fascist <b>Party</b> was nominally {{in charge of the}} Italian Social Republic, a small fascist state set up in Northern Italy after the Allies entered Rome. The Salò Republic was in fact a German puppet state and most of its internal and external policies were dictated by German military commanders. Nevertheless, Italian fascists were allowed to keep the trappings of sovereignty. It was under these conditions that they organized the Congress of Verona, ostensibly for the purpose of charting a new political course and rejuvenating the Italian fascist movement.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} Republican National Convention of 1936, the Mafia consiglieri entered {{the race for}} Congress. From the 41st District of the House, made up heavily of the <b>Italian</b> West Side, <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> leaders handpicked J. Francis Harter, an Amherst Attorney, as their candidate. When many people opposed because Harter lived outside the 41st District - outside of the City of Buffalo all {{together}} - John Montana used it as his blessing to create a splinter in the Erie County <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> and lead a dissident faction that supported his candidacy as a representative to the U.S. House.|$|R
25|$|The idea of uniting the centrist {{components}} of The Olive Tree coalitions, which were divided in many parties, was discussed {{at least since}} 1996. In the 1996 general election there were actually two centrist lists within the Italian centre-left: the Populars for Prodi, including the Italian People's Party (PPI), Democratic Union (UD), the <b>Italian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> (PRI) and the South Tyrolean People's Party (SVP), and that of Italian Renewal (RI), including the Italian Socialists (SI), which later merged into the Italian Democratic Socialists (SDI) in 1998, and the Segni Pact (PS). In 1998 splinters from the centre-right coalition formed the Democratic Union for the Republic (UDR), later transformed into Union of Democrats for Europe (UDEUR), {{in order to support}} the D'Alema I Cabinet. In 1999 splinters of PPI, UD and other groups formed The Democrats (Dem).|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the Pentapartito – the five {{governing}} parties, Christian Democracy (Democrazia Cristiana), the Italian Socialist Party, the Italian Social-Democratic Party, the <b>Italian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> and the Italian Liberal Party – {{lost much of}} their electoral strength almost overnight due to {{a large number of}} judicial investigations concerning the financial corruption of many of their foremost members (see the Mani Pulite affair). This led to a general expectation that upcoming elections would be won by the Democratic Party of the Left, the heirs to the former Italian Communist Party, and their Alliance of Progressives coalition – unless an alternative arose. On 26 January 1994, Berlusconi announced his decision to enter politics, ("enter the field", in his own words) presenting his own political party, Forza Italia, on a platform focused on defeating the Communists. His political aim was to convince the voters of the Pentapartito, who were shocked and confused by Mani Pulite scandals, that Forza Italia offered both a fresh uniqueness and the continuation of the pro-western free market policies followed by Italy {{since the end of the}} Second World War. Shortly after he decided to enter the political arena, investigators into the Mani Pulite affair were said to be close to issuing warrants for the arrest of Berlusconi and senior executives of his business group. During his political career Berlusconi repeatedly stated that the Mani Pulite investigations were led by communist prosecutors who wanted to establish a soviet-style government in Italy.|$|E

50|$|When the Republic was {{established}} on the 5 October 1910 Revolution, {{the members of}} the party initially stood together, but soon began splitting into different parties, including the Democratic <b>Party,</b> Democratic Leftwing <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> Reformist <b>Party,</b> <b>Republican</b> Union, Evolutionist <b>Party,</b> Centrist <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> Popular <b>Party,</b> Radical <b>Party,</b> <b>Republican</b> Liberal <b>Party,</b> Liberal <b>Republican</b> Union, Reconstitution <b>Party</b> and Nationalist <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|R

His government was unevenly supported by the DC, {{but also by the}} Italian Socialist Party, along with the minor <b>Italian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> and Italian Democratic Socialist Party. The centre-left coalition, a first for the Italian post-war political panorama, stayed in power until the 1968 general elections. His 3rd cabinet (1966–68) stayed in power for 833 days, a record for Italy's so-called [...] "First Republic".|$|E
2500|$|Apart from satirizing Silvio Berlusconi and {{mainstream}} television in Ginger and Fred, Fellini rarely expressed his political views {{in public and}} never directed an overtly political film. He directed two electoral television spots during the 1990s: one for DC and another for the <b>Italian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> or PRI. His slogan, [...] "Non si interrompe un'emozione" [...] (Don't interrupt an emotion), was directed against the excessive use of advertisements in TV. The slogan was also used by the Democratic Party of the Left in the referendums of 1995.|$|E
2500|$|In 1919 Raffaele Rossetti {{retired as}} colonel. With {{the advent of}} the Italian Fascism, he {{became a member of the}} <b>Italian</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> (PRI). He also founded the Anti-fascism {{movement}} [...] "Italia libera" [...] together with Giovanni Conti, Randolfo Pacciardi and others. In 1925 he was assailed by Fascist squads, and decided to move to France. Here he was part of the directive of Giustizia e Libertà, an anti-fascist movement of Italian activists in Paris. In 1930 he exited the movement and, together with Cipriano Facchinetti, founded another anti-fascist movement, La Giovine Italia. In 1932 he was elected secretary of the exiled PRI, but the following year he was replaced by Pacciardi.|$|E
