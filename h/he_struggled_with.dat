5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Coward {{suffered}} from arteriosclerosis and, during the run of Suite in Three Keys, <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> bouts of memory loss. This also affected his work in The Italian Job, and he retired from acting immediately afterwards. Coward was knighted in 1969 and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He received a Tony Award for lifetime achievement. In 1972, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree by the University of Sussex.|$|E
5|$|He {{started the}} first match of 2010–11 away at Wolverhampton Wanderers, but was dropped {{for the next}} match in favour of Collins. Higginbotham signed a {{contract}} extension in October 2010 for a further 12 months, keeping him at Stoke until the summer of 2013. He made his 200th top-flight appearance against Manchester United on 24 October 2010. <b>He</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> injury {{for the rest of}} the first half of the season, and was in and out of the first team.|$|E

5|$|However <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> poor form {{during the}} 1950–51 season {{as his first}} {{marriage}} {{was coming to an}} end and he came into increasing conflict with his teammates. He was angered when the club sold Jackie Sewell to Sheffield Wednesday in March 1951 – breaking Lawton's own transfer record in the process – as he felt the move showed a lack of ambition from the club's directors. He also found that the well paid job he was promised outside of football did not transpire. His tally of nine goals in 31 games in 1950–51 and 13 goals in 31 games in 1951–52 was disappointing, and he was made available for transfer.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{signed with}} the Cincinnati Reds on April 8, 1995. Again <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> injury, and {{was placed on the}} {{disabled}} list once for tendinitis in his right shoulder and once for a strained rib cage muscle. In his only year with the club, Jackson posted a team-best 2.39 ERA, while recording 41 strikeouts over 40 games. Jackson and the Reds made the playoffs, winning the National League Divisional Series but losing the National League Championship Series to the Atlanta Braves in four games. Jackson was granted free agency on November 3, 1995.|$|E
5|$|Patton never seriously {{considered}} a career {{other than the}} military. At the age of seventeen he sought an appointment to the United States Military Academy. Patton applied to several universities with Reserve Officer's Training Corps programs. Patton was accepted to Princeton College but eventually decided on VMI, which {{his father and grandfather}} had attended. He attended the school from 1903 to 1904 and, though <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> reading and writing, performed exceptionally in uniform and appearance inspection as well as military drill. While Patton was at VMI, California's Senator nominated him for West Point.|$|E

He enrolled in the Army {{in search of a}} disciplined environment, served in the Vietnam War, and was wounded in action on November 19, 1965. After his discharge, <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> drug problems. Robinson Jr. eventually completed the treatment program at Daytop Village in Seymour, Connecticut, and became a counselor at the institution. On June 17, 1971, he was killed in an automobile accident at age 24. The experience with his son's drug addiction turned Robinson Sr. into an avid anti-drug crusader {{toward the end of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|The {{winter of}} 1979/80 and the {{followed}} summer saw difficult tours for Willis: the Benson and Hedges World Series Cup and a Test tour in Australia {{followed by a}} home series against the West Indies. Willis partook in all seven of England's matches for the World Series Cup, however <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> six wickets at 41.00. England did secure {{the highest number of}} points however they were beaten in both finals by the West Indies. In the midst of these matches, England and Australia played three Test matches in which Willis took only 3 wickets at 74.66, going wicketless in third Test. In the county front, however, his position at Warwickshire was reaffirmed as he was appointed county captain.|$|E
5|$|After 103 {{appearances}} for Third Division Gillingham {{he moved}} on to top-flight Coventry City in 1983 for a fee approaching £85,000. <b>He</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> injury during his time at Highfield Road, and was never popular with the fans. Keith Houchen also recalled that he did not get along with manager John Sillett and was prone to sulking when left out of the team. Despite this he managed to play over 100 games for City over a four-year period before Leeds United manager Billy Bremner took him to the Second Division for a £110,000 fee. Near the end of his first season at Leeds he played in the club's FA Cup Semi-final defeat to former club Coventry at Hillsborough, as Coventry won 3–2 in extra time. Leeds suffered further heartbreak in 1987 by losing the play-off Final to Charlton Athletic, again after extra time.|$|E

5|$|After a short {{stint in}} the minors in 2000, Nathan {{spent most of the}} season in the majors, {{finishing}} 5–2 and even hitting two home runs. But <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> his control, walking 63 in 93 innings and ending the season with a 5.21 ERA. He was on the disabled list twice: from May 17 to June 6 for right shoulder tendinitis and from July 14 to August 18 for an inflamed right shoulder, necessitating arthroscopic surgery on the afflicted shoulder {{at the end of the}} season. Nathan divided 2001 between the AAA Fresno Grizzlies and AA Shreveport both starting and relieving, finishing with a disappointing combined 3–11 record and an ERA over 7. Nathan improved slightly in 2002 to 6–12 with an ERA of over 5 at Fresno, but finally overcame his postsurgical struggles to return to the Giants in September with 3 scoreless innings in relief.|$|E
5|$|After {{just over}} a year in office, Cook was forced to call a new election, the first double dissolution. Labor won back its {{majority}} in the House, and Fisher returned for a third term as prime minister. <b>He</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> the demands of Australia's participation in World War I, and in October 1915 resigned in favour of Billy Hughes. Fisher subsequently accepted an appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, holding that position from 1916 to 1920. After a brief return to Australia, he retired to London, dying there at the age of 66. In total, Fisher served as prime minister for just under five years; Bob Hawke is {{the only member of the}} Labor Party to have served for longer.|$|E
5|$|In February 2001, he was {{acquired}} by the Canucks. Cloutier enjoyed his most successful years as an NHL goaltender with Vancouver, recording three consecutive 30-win seasons between 2001–02 and 2003–04. In the 2006 off-season, he was dealt to Los Angeles, where <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> injuries {{and a decline in}} play. His contract was bought out by the team following the 2007–08 season. As part of an attempted comeback in 2009, he first signed a deal to try out with the Detroit Red Wings at the team's training camp, then played briefly with the AHL's Rockford IceHogs, before retiring due to chronic injury problems. Internationally, Cloutier was part of two Canadian teams. He won a gold medal at the 1995 World Junior Championship and was a fourth-string goaltender at the 2001 IIHF World Championship.|$|E

5|$|In November 1947, {{he made a}} {{surprise}} move to Third Division South club Notts County for a British record transfer fee of £20,000. He helped the club to win promotion as champions in 1949–50, before {{he moved on to}} Brentford in March 1952 for a club record £16,000. In January 1953, Brentford appointed him player-manager, though he would only remain in charge for nine months. He joined Arsenal as a player in November 1953 for £10,000, where he saw out the remainder of his playing career. He had a promising start to his managerial career by leading Kettering Town to the Southern League title in 1956–57, but then only had two more seasons as manager, getting relegated with Notts County in 1957–58 and then relegated with Kettering Town in 1963–64. During the 1970s <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> debt and related legal problems, which were reported in the media {{as an example of a}} celebrated person having fallen from grace.|$|E
5|$|More detail {{was given}} in Darwin's 1868 book on The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, which tried to explain {{heredity}} through his hypothesis of pangenesis. Although Darwin had privately questioned blending inheritance, <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> the theoretical difficulty that novel individual variations would tend to blend into a population. However, inherited variation could be seen, and Darwin's concept of selection working on a population {{with a range of}} small variations was workable. It was not until the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s that a model of heredity became completely integrated with a model of variation. This modern evolutionary synthesis had been dubbed Neo Darwinian Evolution because it encompasses Charles Darwin's theories of evolution with Gregor Mendel's theories of genetic inheritance.|$|E
5|$|Ramírez pitched for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre for the {{remainder}} of the International League season, finishing with a Class AAA record of 1–5 with a 3.19 ERA in 29 games. Ramírez was promoted to the Yankees when MLB rosters expanded on September 1. He remained with the Yankees for September; along with fellow call-ups Jonathan Albaladejo, David Robertson, Mike Dunn and Mark Melancon, Ramírez was expected to absorb some of the workload in the bullpen, helping to spare the overworked Alfredo Aceves, Phil Hughes, Phil Coke, and Dámaso Marte. Towards the end of the season, he was only used on blowout games as a result of his ineffectiveness. Ramírez finished the season with a 5.73 ERA, allowing fourteen earned runs in 22 innings; though he did strike out exactly one batter per inning, he also issued too many walks as <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> consistency. Though Ramírez did not appear in the 2009 postseason with the Yankees, the organization did present him with a 2009 World Series ring.|$|E

5|$|After his batting {{displays}} in Perth, Pathan {{was promoted to}} open the batting in the Fourth Test in Adelaide, replacing the struggling Wasim Jaffer and thereby allowing Harbhajan to return in a five-bowler attack. In a high-scoring match, Pathan took 3/112, but <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> the responsibility of opening, scoring nine and a duck. In a high-scoring match, he took 3/112 in Australia's 563.Following the Test series, he top-scored with 26 as India were skittles for 74 in the one-off T20 international. Pathan held {{his place in the}} ODI team and played all 10 matches in the Commonwealth Bank Trophy, scoring 118 runs at 19.66 mostly in the lower order and taking 11 wickets at 34.27 at an economy rate of 5.49. His best performance was a 4/41 against Australia at Adelaide to help restrict the hosts to 203 but India then collapsed to a 50-run loss. His top-score of 31 in the series came in partnership with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the closing stages of a successful and tense run-chase against Sri Lanka. Pathan struggled in the two finals against Australia, taking three wickets at 39.00 at an economy rate of 7.46 but his teammates did enough to ensure a 2–0 win.|$|E
5|$|Haynes' father {{attended}} the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876 {{where he learned}} of a school that would fit his son's interests. Using the money he had saved, Haynes decided to attend the college and enrolled in the Worcester Technical Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, in September 1878. The school was revolutionary for its time, combining technical training with a classical liberal arts education. Although he easily passed the difficult entrance exam, he {{found that he was}} ill-prepared for some of his college courses, and <b>he</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> mathematics. To earn an income while away from home, he worked as a custodian and night guard at the local public library. He cleaned the building overnight and used his spare time to read books and study. During his final year at the school, boarding rates were increased beyond what Haynes could afford so with no other option, he lived in the library for several months. He could not afford to return home during his stay at the institute, so during the holidays he spent time with his family and friends in New England.|$|E
5|$|John was {{the eldest}} child of Victor Hervey, 6th Marquess of Bristol. He was distant from his father, who treated him harshly, {{and did not}} get on well with him, though {{he was close to}} his first stepmother, Lady Juliet. After {{spending}} time in London, Monte Carlo, Paris and New York in the 1970s, he settled in part of the family seat, Ickworth House in Suffolk, becoming the 7th Marquess in 1985. Despite inheriting a large fortune of up to £35 million, the Marquess spent most of it during his lifetime. <b>He</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> addiction to cocaine and other drugs, serving several jail sentences for possession, and was known for his flamboyant lifestyle and homosexuality. His brief marriage in the mid-1980s did not last because of this, and he became increasingly depressed as he lost money and faced bankruptcy, culminating in the sale of the remainder of Ickworth House to the National Trust. He died in early 1999 of complications resulting from his drug addiction, and was succeeded by his half-brother, Frederick Hervey, 8th Marquess of Bristol.|$|E
