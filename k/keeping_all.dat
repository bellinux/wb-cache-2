25|$|The lancha was a {{large ship}} adapted to deep waters and used for hake-fishing. The largest of which had twelve oars and could carry 30 men.

The Lancha Poveira was considered by Lixa Filgueiras and Raul Brandão to be descendant from the Viking longboats, <b>keeping</b> <b>all</b> the longboat features but without a long stern and bow.

25|$|Fraternal {{polyandry}} {{achieves a}} similar goal {{to that of}} primogeniture in 19th-century England. Primogeniture dictated that the eldest son inherited the family estate, while younger sons had to leave home and seek their own employment. Primogeniture maintained family estates intact over generations by permitting only one heir per generation. Fraternal polyandry also accomplishes this, but does so by <b>keeping</b> <b>all</b> the brothers together with just one wife {{so that there is}} only one set of heirs per generation. This strategy appears less successful the larger the fraternal sibling group.|$|E
25|$|Originally air {{turbulence}} {{was kept}} to a minimum by <b>keeping</b> <b>all</b> signage flat to the tunnel walls. Now the ventilation space above head height is crowded with ducting, conduits, cameras, speakers and equipment acting as a baffle plates with predictable reductions in flow. Often electronic signs have their flat surface at right angles to the main air flow, causing choked flow. Temporary sign boards that stand at the top of escalators also maximise turbulence. The alterations to the ventilation system are important, not only to heat exchange, but also the quality of the air at platform level, particularly given its asbestos content.|$|E
25|$|IT security: Sometimes {{referred}} to as computer security, information technology security (IT security) is information security applied to technology (most often some form of computer system). It is worthwhile to note that a computer {{does not necessarily mean}} a home desktop. A computer is any device with a processor and some memory. Such devices can range from non-networked standalone devices as simple as calculators, to networked mobile computing devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. IT security specialists are almost always found in any major enterprise/establishment due to the nature and value of the data within larger businesses. They are responsible for <b>keeping</b> <b>all</b> of the technology within the company secure from malicious cyber attacks that often attempt to breach into critical private information or gain control of the internal systems.|$|E

25|$|When the {{genocide}} in Rwanda began in April 1994, some delegates of MSF {{working in the}} country were incorporated into the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) medical team for protection. Both groups succeeded in <b>keeping</b> <b>all</b> main hospitals in Rwanda's capital Kigali operational throughout the main period of {{the genocide}}. MSF, together with several other aid organisations, {{had to leave the}} country in 1995, although many MSF and ICRC volunteers worked together under the ICRC's rules of engagement, which held that neutrality was of the utmost importance. These events led to a debate within the organisation about the concept of balancing neutrality of humanitarian aid workers against their witnessing role. As a result of its Rwanda mission, the position of MSF with respect to neutrality moved closer to that of the ICRC, a remarkable development {{in the light of the}} origin of the organisation.|$|E
25|$|This was all {{the more}} galling given that, under the Spaniards and Austrians, the city's {{inhabitants}} received no compensation for all this: they were to provide housing to the soldiers free of charge. The government claimed that since the garrison's presence brought trade and business which benefited the city's merchants and artisans, it was only fair for citizens to contribute by lodging the troops. Nor was the burden of quartering troops shared equally, by any means: there were many exemptions, reflecting the social inequality of the Ancien Régime society. The justiciar, the aldermen, lawyers, members of the provincial council, and the nobility were exempt. The magistrates assigned soldiers to houses, and to this effect made lists with very detailed descriptions of houses' interiors. Abuses of power could not be prevented: the authorities were known to assign an excessive number of soldiers to the houses of residents who had been involved in disputes with the city. Citizens tried to wriggle out of these obligations by deliberately not <b>keeping</b> <b>all</b> rooms in their house fit for habitation; the wealthier inhabitants were able to avoid taking in soldiers by paying their way out.|$|E

500|$|Even in {{a design}} that is {{intended}} to be synchronously tuned, some staggered tuning effect is inevitable because of the practical impossibility of <b>keeping</b> <b>all</b> tuned circuits perfectly in step and because of feedback effects.
