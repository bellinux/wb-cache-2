500|$|To {{further the}} {{traditional}} [...] "Sonic formula", every level was designed in a tube-like fashion; Sonic {{would be able}} to walk onto walls, thus changing the direction of gravity and the rotation of the level itself, much like the special stages in Knuckles' Chaotix. In addition, an unusual, <b>fish-eye</b> lens-styled camera was put into place so players could see more of their surroundings at any given time. [...] Senn has highlighted that the 3D gameplay still kept true to the Sonic series formula of collecting rings and speeding through game levels. [...] Wallis also made mention of the game's overall layout, consisting of three acts per zone and varying in focuses on speed, exploration, and puzzle solving.|$|E
500|$|A music video, co-directed by Neil Pollock and Jonathan Bekemeier, {{to promote}} the single shows the band playing its {{instruments}} through a distorted <b>fish-eye</b> lens, the camera variously panning horizontally across the performance space and vertically over the individual band members. Keeping {{in the spirit of}} the mimed performance, Francis and bassist Kim Deal open and shut their mouths in time with their prerecorded vocals, yet make no attempt to articulate their lips in synch with the words that they are supposed to be singing. Instead, they simply keep their mouths wide open with blank expressions for the duration of each verse. Francis stated that [...] "Water on the brain" [...] was the theme of the clip.|$|E
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 3: Shatter cracks, flakes, <b>fish-eyes</b> and micro {{perforations}} ...|$|R
50|$|Hydrogen {{present in}} metals can produce {{several kinds of}} {{internal}} defects like blisters, shatter fracture, flakes, <b>fish-eyes</b> and porosity. Carbon steels exposed to hydrogen at high temperatures experience hydrogen attack which leads to internal decarburization and weakening.|$|R
50|$|Flakes and shatter cracks are {{internal}} fissures seen {{in large}} forgings. Hydrogen picked up during melting and casting segregates at internal voids and discontinuities and produces these defects during forging. <b>Fish-eyes</b> are bright patches named for their appearance seen on fracture surfaces, generally of weldments. Hydrogen enters the metal during fusion-welding and produces this defect during subsequent stressing. Steel containment vessels exposed to extremely high hydrogen pressures develop small fissures or micro perforations through which fluids may leak.|$|R
500|$|As the game's design {{had changed}} {{significantly}} and evolved beyond {{the capabilities of}} the struggling Sega 32X, the game was shifted again to the Sega Saturn. The Saturn version of the project was initially developed separately by two teams in parallel starting {{in the second half of}} 1995. One team, led by designer Chris Senn and programmer Ofer Alon, was in charge of developing the main game for PC. The other team, led by Robert Morgan and including programmer Chris Coffin, worked on porting Senn and Alon's work to the Saturn while developing the [...] "free-roaming, 'arena-style'" [...] 3D boss engine. Senn and Alon's [...] "fixed-camera side-scroller" [...] with the ability [...] "to move freely in all directions" [...] was similar to Bug!, and featured a <b>fish-eye</b> camera system (called the [...] "Reflex Lens") that gave players a wide-angle view of the action. As a result, levels appeared to move around Sonic.|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery from MTV {{commented that}} [...] "it's a little {{surprising}} that the just-released clip for Beyoncé's 'Video Phone' has nary a flame or <b>fish-eye</b> shot (there are, of course, plenty of outlandish costumes). However, don't {{make the mistake of}} thinking this video is by any means straightforward— it's plenty WTF! [...] It's definitely not the Gaga we're used to seeing, but her appearance isn't exactly run-of-the-mill, either. And neither is this video, for that matter. Especially not when you're watching Beyoncé snap her gum and shake her hips and grope an AK-47 while the screen pops from electric green to Kool-Aid red." [...] Jocelyn Vena of the same publication noted, [...] "The clip is charged with energy, and the cynics out there might wonder if putting two sizzling divas in a room together created any kind of rivalry." [...] Jim Farber from New York's Daily News compared Knowles' look to that of pin-up model Bettie Page, and said [...] "The clip for 'Video Phone' [...] doesn't offer {{much in the way of}} chemistry or even interaction between the two divas. [...] clip seems about as innovative as a rotary dial up." [...] Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone commented that the video was an [...] "almost seizure-inducing parade of cinematic homages and wardrobe changes." [...] He also compared Knowles' look to Page, as well as Katy Perry and rapper M.I.A. The Daily Mail gave a positive review of the video, calling it avant-garde and naughty.|$|E

40|$|The classic {{perspective}} projection is mostly used when calibrating a camera. Although {{this approach is}} fairly developed and often suitable, {{it is not necessarily}} adequate to model any camera system like <b>fish-eyes</b> or catadioptrics. The {{perspective projection}} is not applicable when field of views reach 180 ° and beyond. In this case an appropriate model for a particular non perspective camera has to be used. Having an unknown camera system a generic camera model is required. This paper discusses a variety of parametric and generic camera models. These models will be validated subsequently using different camera systems. A unified approach of deriving initial parameter guesses for subsequent parameter optimisation is presented. Experimental results prove that generic camera models perform as accurate as a particular parametric model would do. Furthermore, there is no previous knowledge about the camera system needed...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the authors}} {{analyzed}} {{the data of}} thermal environmental indicators observed in typical thermal stress days in Chongqing City, an outstandingly growing megalopolis in China. And they calculated the physiological thermal indicators at several observation points with various landscapes in the city, and discussed on these temporal and spatial features {{from the viewpoint of}} urban structure around them. In the process, because it was impossible to access to electronic spatial information database such as urban planning GIS data and so on, the physiological thermal indicators calculated using observation results were compared to results of numerical simulation using the sky view photograph by <b>fish-eyes</b> lens and Rayman Model. Then the both results agreed well. This means the physiological thermal indicators can be calculated with some accuracy by simple method, even if in the field without detail electronic spatial information database. It is considered that this method is useful for evaluation of thermal environment in the area with a lac...|$|R

Which--(though {{it was not}} the fact; Friedrich's opposition, once that Reichs-Guarantee of his own was got, being mostly passive, [...] "Push it through the stolid element, then, YOU stolid fellows, if you can!")--awoke {{considerable}} outcry in England. Lively suspicion there, of treasonous intentions to the Cause of Liberty, on his Prussian Majesty's part; and--coupled with other causes that had risen--a great deal of ill-nature, in very dark condition, against his Prussian Majesty. And it was not Friedrich's blame, chiefly or at all. If indeed Friedrich would have forwarded the Enterprise:--but he merely did not; and the element was viscous, stolid. Austria itself had wished the thing; but with nothing like such enthusiasm as King George;--to whom the refusal, by Friedrich and Fate, was a bitter disappointment. Poor Britannic Majesty: Archduke Joseph came to be King of the Romans, in due course; right enough. And long before that event (almost before George had ended his vain effort to hasten it), Austria turned on its pivot; and had clasped, not England to its bosom, but France (thanks to that exquisite Kaunitz); and was in arms AGAINST England, dear Hanover, and the Cause of Liberty! Vain to look too far ahead,--especially with those <b>fish-eyes.</b> Smelfungus has a Note on Kaunitz; readable, though far too irreverent of that superlative Diplomatist, and unjust to the real human merits he had.|$|R
2500|$|The virtuosity and {{attention}} to detail in lighting and set design was coupled with Gilliam's trademark obsession for very wide lenses and tilted camera angles; going unusually wide for an audience used to mainstream Hollywood productions, Gilliam made the film's wide-angle shots with 14mm (Zeiss), 11mm, and 9.8mm (Kinoptik) lenses, the latter being a recent technological innovation {{at the time as}} one of the first lenses of that short a focal length that did not <b>fish-eye.</b> In fact, over the years, the 14mm lens has become informally known as [...] "The Gilliam" [...] among film-makers due to the director's frequent use of it since Brazil.|$|E

6000|$|It was cold, {{though the}} month was August; it blew {{and the sky}} was grey and rain {{beginning}} to fall when we came down about noon to a small town on the Norfolk coast, where we hoped to find lodging and such comforts as could be purchased out of a slender purse. It was a small modern pleasure town of an almost startling appearance owing to the material used in building its straight rows of cottages and its ugly square houses and villas. This was an orange-brown stone found in the neighbourhood, the roofs being all of hard, black slate. I had never seen houses of such a colour, it was stronger, more glaring and aggressive than the reddest brick, and there was not a green thing to partially screen or soften it, nor did the darkness of the wet weather have any mitigating effect on it. The town was built on high ground, with an open grassy space before it sloping down to the cliff in which steps had been cut to give access to the beach, and beyond the cliff we caught sight of the grey, desolate, wind-vexed sea. But the rain was coming down more and more heavily, turning the streets into torrents, so that we began to envy those who had found a shelter even in so ugly a place. No one would take us in. House after house, street after street, we tried, and at every door with [...] "Apartments to Let" [...] over it where we knocked the same hateful landlady-face appeared with the same triumphant gleam in the <b>fish-eyes</b> and the same smile on the mouth that opened to tell us delightedly that she and the town were [...] "full up"; that never had there been known such a rush of visitors; applicants were being turned away every hour from every door! ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, truly {{it might}} have been King George's best bargain to close with Friedrich; to {{guarantee}} Julich and Berg, and get Fredrich to stand between the French and Hanover; while George, with an England behind him, in such humor, went wholly into that Spanish Business, the one thing needful to them at present. Truly; but then again, there are considerations: [...] "What is this Friedrich, just come out upon the world? What real fighting power has he, after all that ridiculous drilling and recruiting Friedrich Wilhelm made? Will he be faithful in bargain; is not, perhaps, from of old, his bias always toward France rather? And the Kaiser, what will the Kaiser say to it?" [...] These are questions for a Britannic Majesty! Seldom was seen such an insoluble imbroglio of potentialities; dangerous to touch, dangerous to leave lying;--and his Britannic Majesty's procedures upon it are of a very slow intricate sort; and will grow still more so, year after year, in the new intricacies that are coming, and be a weariness to my readers and me. For observe the simultaneous fact. All this while, Robinson at Vienna is dunning the Imperial Majesty to remember old Marlborough days and the Laws of Nature; and declare for us against France, in case of the worst. What an attempt! Imperial Majesty has no money; Imperial Majesty remembers recent days rather, and his own last quarrel with France (on the Polish-Election score), in which you Sea-Powers cruelly stood neuter! One comfort, and pretty much one only, is left to a nearly bankrupt Imperial heart; that France does at any rate ratify Pragmatic Sanction, and instead of enemy to that inestimable Document has become friend,--if only she be well let alone. [...] "Let well alone," [...] says the sad Kaiser, bankrupt of heart as well as purse: [...] "I have saved the Pragmatic, got Fleury to guarantee it; I will hunt wild swine and not shadows any more: ask me not!" [...] And now this Herstal business; the Imperial Dehortatoriums, perhaps of a high nature, that are like to come? More hopeless proposition the Britannic Majesty never made than this to the Kaiser. But he persists in it, orders Robinson to persist; knocks at the Austrian door with one hand, at the Prussian or Anti-Austrian with the other; and gazes, with those proud <b>fish-eyes,</b> into perils and potentialities and a sea of troubles. Wearisome to think of, were not one bound to it!
