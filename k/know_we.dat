No; nature made us— nature did it all— not the gods of the religions.|$|E

But, you <b>know,</b> <b>we</b> had one member of the United States Senate vote against the PATRIOT Act, the blank check that was given by Congress to this president, I think in total abrogation of the role of Congress under separation of powers and under the power to make war, to declare war.

500|$|Arsenal {{began the}} season with a 2–0 home victory against {{promoted}} Birmingham City; goals from Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord extended the club's winning run to fourteen matches – a new top-flight record. A late equaliser by Wiltord in their next match at West Ham United earned Arsenal a point, having trailed 2–0 in the first half. Three days later, a 5–2 win against West Bromwich Albion moved Arsenal {{to the top of the}} league table. Although they drew to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, having lost captain Vieira through a sending-off, a win against Manchester City meant Arsenal leapfrogged local rivals Tottenham Hotspur to first position. A 3–0 win at Charlton Athletic on 15 September 2002 pleased Wenger, who indicated after the match the league was theirs to lose: [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>we</b> can win the league. We <b>know</b> <b>we</b> can be stronger. At this stage last season we were not as good as we are now."
