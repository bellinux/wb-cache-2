50|$|As {{the crisis}} {{proceeded}} {{over the next}} 1 hours, hostages were continuously threatened as well as police. At one time the gunman had hostages line up single file for having their necks taped together for better control. About 45 minutes into the standoff a young hostage and employee of the restaurant locked himself in the <b>frozen</b> <b>food</b> <b>locker.</b> The distraction caused a burst of gunfire from Strozzi toward the rear doors {{in anticipation of a}} police assault. The distraction allowed one hostage to escape without harm through {{the front door of the}} restaurant. Another time the gunman ordered the carpets saturated with spirits from the restaurant bar indicating that he intended to burn the place down. The husband of an elderly couple was sent out with car keys needed to clear cars from the lot while his wife remained with the group. Strozzi announced that if he did not get demands met by 9 pm, he would proceed to kill hostages and burn the place down.|$|E

40|$|How much meat should I {{have in my}} locker from a 1000 pound steer? This is {{the type}} of {{question}} that is asked most frequently by locker patrons. Many people, now using <b>frozen</b> <b>food</b> <b>lockers</b> have little conception of how much meat, the number of pieces, or the type of cuts that they should expect from one carcass. Neither do they realize what happens to a large part of a steer before reaching the locker. Actually a 1000 pound steer will yield approximately 180 pounds of steaks of varied kinds, 180 pounds of roast and pot roasts, and 90 pounds of stew and ground meat making a total of 450 pounds of table meat which is 45 percent of the live weight of the animal. A comparable shrinkage occurs when a hog or a lamb is butchered...|$|R

It sat 24 in its main dining room, 18 in its dome, and 10 in its reserve private dining room beneath the dome. It was both the first dome diner to be built and the first diner of any kind with an all-electric kitchen. At its front end, the car featured the crew's toilet, an icemaker, and food storage accessible from the kitchen. The kitchen covered roughly the first third of the car, and it entirely constructed of stainless steel and featured a pan floor made of the anti-slip material Martex. The kitchen featured {{a wide array of}} electric appliances, including a <b>frozen</b> <b>food</b> <b>locker,</b> a General Electric (GE) broiler, a GE garbage disposal unit, three GE ranges, a Hobart dishwasher, a hot table, a water heater, a Hotpoint fry kettle, a KitchenAid mixer, three ovens, plate warmers, and Pullman-Standard refrigerators with mechanics made by Frigidaire.

The recommendations are based on investigations under locker plant conditions conducted over a period of 4 years by the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station. In order that the products would be comparable to those obtained by using ordinary household equipment, preparation and processing was done on a small scale in a kitchen laboratory to simulate home conditions. 2 Careful attention was given to details of necessary measures preparatory to freezing as well as to subsequent procedures. The methods herein described have been found to yield frozen products of excellent quality. The information is not intended as a guide for the commercial packing of frozen products.

40|$|THE {{complaint}} is occasionally heard that ^chickens or turkeys obtained from commercial storage or <b>frozen</b> <b>food</b> <b>lockers</b> {{were found to}} be rancid. The fact that large numbers of frozen birds are satisfactorily preserved in storage would indicate that rancidity develops to an ob-jectionable extent only in special cases or under unusual conditions. It might be ex-pected that with the rapid expansion of the practice of evisceration, the problem of rancidity would become more serious, because of the greater area of tissue ex-posed to the air. Cook and White (1939) have investi-gated the development of rancidity in chickens in frozen storage. They reached the conclusion that at a temperature of 7. 5 °F., rancidity did not develop rapidly enough to present a problem during the normal storage period. However, after 25 months storage at this temperature, they found peroxide values indicative of in-cipient rancidity. The development of a fishy flavor in chickens and particularly in turkeys as a result of feeding fish oil or fish meal has been investigated in a number of labora-tories. Most of these studies have been 1 Contribution numbers 316 from the department of chemistry, 135 from the department of home eco-nomics, and 166 from the department of poultr...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1949 The {{purpose of}} this study is to bring {{together}} some data relating to the general structure of the Portland livestock and meat trade and to describe some phases of the functional process of concentration and dispersion in physical terms as well as treat with some factors significant to the marketing picture. The importance of the geographical location of the transportation routes has been of considerable significance in the developemnt of the Portland market as an outlet for the livestock production of eastern Oregon and southern Idaho. The volume of livestock reaching the market has not kept pace with the growth of human population of the area. There has been evident some increase of 'direct' livestock receipts as well as an increase of imports of cured meats. Complete data on this export-import balance of dressed meats are lacking but it would appear that this trade will be of greater significance in the future than in the past. Country killed meats are not as important a factor in the market now as at the time of an earlier study carried out by the Oregon State College Experiment Station in 1934. However country killed veal still accounts for about fifty percent of the veal supply on the market. This is a result of the peculiar situation of the market both in relation to dairy production areas and with respect to legal restrictions which permit the sale of this product on the market. In a random survey of seventeen cities scattered throughout the United States, it was found that the majority of them have meat inspection laws which do not permit the sale of this type of product. Seasonal variation of receipts of various kinds of livestock indicate that this phenomenon is most apparent in the case of sheep and lambs, less so in calves and hogs, and least of all for cattle. Wartime conditions created a substantial increase in the magnitude of the seasonal variation of cattle receipts at the market. From the meat packers' point of view this is an undesirable feature as it complicates the attainment of an optimum combination of their resources in the internal management of their plants. There is an apparent excess of plant capacity over the needs of the market area which has led to a highly competitive situation in the meat trade. This characteristic is carried through to the well defined wholesale level and there are a great many wholesalers competing for the restaurant and retail trade. <b>Frozen</b> <b>food</b> <b>lockers</b> are increasing in number and importance and may be worthy of some more detailed study. Prices and price reporting of the market have been examined with two objectives in mind. First, a method whereby some simple indicator of market trend might be developed which would accurately record market movements. Second, a comparison of live and dressed prices to illustrate such relationships as may exist. It is apparent that the first objective is not to be attained easily. Price relationships between live and dressed meats do appear to be reasonably consistent for calves, lambs and hogs. Further work on these relationships would be desirable as more adequate data are accumulated...|$|R
