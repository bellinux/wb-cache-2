40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a case study}} featuring Axiomatic Design and Multi-Level Hierarchical model (MLH) applied to redesign a <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>pump</b> set. In particular, two different design concepts are presented {{to be applied to}} the supporting frame of the system to limit a vibration problem that can arise during potential malfunctioning of the <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>pump.</b> The selection of the best design has been carried out through reliability evaluation process and through the cost of failure based on the MLH model...|$|E

50|$|During World War II, the {{decision}} was made to fit several Wellington-based engines, particularly of the C class, with <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>pumps</b> in case of Japanese air-raid. At least one locomotive, C 849, was so fitted but the boiler-mounted pumps were not successful, and relied on sufficient water supply from the locomotive's boiler to function. Following the cessation of hostilities, these pumps were quickly removed.|$|R
5000|$|High-pressure pumps {{for larger}} {{missiles}} had been discussed by rocket pioneers such as Hermann Oberth. In mid-1935 Wernher von Braun initiated a fuel pump {{project at the}} southwest German firm Klein, Schanzlin & Becker that was experienced in building large <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>pumps.</b> The V-2 rocket design used hydrogen peroxide decomposed through a Walter steam generator to power the uncontrolled turbopump produced at the Heinkel plant at Jenbach, so V-2 turbopumps and combustion chamber were tested and matched to prevent the pump from overpressurizing the chamber. The first engine fired successfully in September, and on August 16, 1942, a trial rocket stopped in mid-air and crashed due to a failure in the turbopump. The first successful V-2 launch was on October 3, 1942.|$|R
40|$|Ovaj rad predstavlja kratak pregled i osnovu provođenja tipnih ispitivanja i certificiranja centrifugalnih vatrogasnih pumpi s vakuum uređajem. Navedene postupke za područje zemalja Europske unije provode akreditirane pravne osobe. One temeljem postupaka ispitivanja za navedene proizvode izdaju Europske certifikate, CE. Postupci ispitivanja provode se u skladu s važećim europskim normama EN 1028 - 1 i EN 1028 - 2 koje su nakon njihova konačnog nacrta i objave prihvatila sva nacionalna tijela za normizaciju članica zemalja Europske unije. Provedenim ispitivanjima provjeravaju se glavni i opći sigurnosni zahtjevi koji se postavljaju na centrifugalne vatrogasne pumpe. Kao rezultat tih postupaka ispitivanja navedeni proizvodi dobivaju europski certifikat za proizvodnju i primjenu na području zemalja Europske unije. This text {{describe}} testing prcedure for <b>Fire-fighting</b> centrifugal <b>pumps</b> {{they are}} manufactured compliant to Europian Standards EN 1028 - 1 and En 1028 - 2. The testing procedures perform accreditation bodies are authorized for described testing procedures. This procedures {{described in this}} article applies for centrifugal pumps with primming device for fire-fighting use supplied separately without driver and couplings. The <b>fire-fighting</b> centrifugal <b>pumps</b> with primer are defined as terminated by their inlet and outlet connections as well as by their shafts ends. The testing procedures are referes to <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>pumps</b> are defined compliant to specified norms applies for <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>pumps</b> with priming devices for use under ambient temperature between – 15 °C and + 40 °C. The <b>fire-fighting</b> centrifugal <b>pumps</b> with priming devices according to mentions norm shall conform to the safety requirements and/or protective measure. Pressures are defined according to centrifugal pump testing procedures are inlet pressure (pu), outlet pressure (pi), maximum pressure (pamax), limit pressure (pa lim), closing pressure (pa 0), nominal delivery pressure (pN), static pressure test (pps) and dynamic test. Flow rates are expressed and described as delivery rate (Q) and nominal delivery rate (QN). There are the others technical characteristics as well as nominal speed impeller rotation (nN), priming speed impeller rotation (ns), maximum speed impeller rotation, efficiency (Ƞ), nominal efficiency (ȠN). If the <b>fire-fighting</b> centrifugal <b>pump</b> is compliant to EN 1028 - 1 and 1028 - 2 is defined and described according to it nominal hydraulic characteristics. They are nominal delvery rate (QN), nomianl delivery pressure (pN) and nominal speed impeller rotation (nN). This point in its data sheet has desacribed as the centrifugal pump nominal working point. In this point centrifugal pump has defined as geodetic nominal suction heigh at 3 m. Except at this suction heigh centrifugal pumps shall confirm to requirements have defined at suction height at 7, 5 m. In terms of special requirements fire-fighting centrifugal pumpa shall conform to mechanical hazards, electrical hazards, thermal hazard, hazards from neglecting ergonomic design principles, and also hazards due to breakdown and/or incorrect installation of protection devices. In that sence limit pressures (pa lim), dynamic test pressures (paD) closing pressures (pa 0) shall conforms to datas describe to Table 1. to Table 4. Static test pressure shall be 1, 5 times the nominal delivery pressure for nominal pressure pumps (pps= 1, 5 x pn). The nominal delivery rates (QN), and nominal delivery pressures (pN) shal also conform to Table 1. to Table 4. After the accreditation body has finished testing procedures it has duty and obligation manufacturer supply testing report. Testing report shall be prepared containig at least: 1. 	the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s name and trademark, 2. 	a reference to this European Standard, 3. 	the pump designation according to EN 1028 - 1, 4. 	a fabrication number and year of manufacture, 5. 	a serial number of the pump body, 6. 	result of the test, 7. 	confirmation of whether the pump conforms to, 8. 	the date of the tes...|$|R
50|$|Pyronaut {{was sold}} to the Port of Bristol Authority, who took her to Avonmouth and began work on {{converting}} her into a divers boat. This entailed removing all the <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>pumps</b> and moving her engines forward in the hull to create space for a changing room. The work was never completed, and she was sold again to a private owner in 1983, who began to fit out the changing room as a saloon, {{with the intention of}} using Pyronaut as a working/living craft in the south of Ireland. Shortly before completing the work in 1989, he decided to sell the vessel to Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery, based at the now-closed Bristol Industrial Museum where restoration and preservation was completed in 1995.Pyronaut can now be seen outside the new M Shed museum, berthed with the museum‘s tugs Mayflower and John King. Listed as part of the National Historic Fleet,she performs displays during major harbour events as well as operating for trips on some summer weekends. In June 2012 she travelled to London by road {{to take part in the}} Queens Diamond Jubilee Pageant.|$|R
2500|$|This {{class of}} warship has seven {{independent}} Noske Kaeser air-conditioning plants allowing {{the ship to}} operate at a preset temperature and moisture level in ocean water ranging between 4°C and 30°C, and the air temperature between −4°C and 32°C. This also keeps the air pressure in the citadel five millibars higher than on the outside to prevent the drawing in of RBC (radioactive, biological, or chemical) contamination. These ships are also fitted with Sulzer und Weise seawater <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>pumps</b> and sprinkler systems. These are also ready to wet down the warship's ammunition magazines. In addition, a CO2 fire-extinguishing system protects the gas turbine and diesel engineering areas. The galleys are fitted with an ANSUL system and the flight deck and hangar with a Noske Kaeser Hy FEx foam fire extinguishing system. Two Pall Rochem reverse-osmosis plants generate 15 cubic metres of fresh water each every 24 hours. This water is provided to the galleys, messes, and drinking water supplies, {{and it is also}} used for cooling the guns, the air-conditioners, and the engine room, in addition for [...] washing the helicopters. Water pumped to the guns, sensors, and air-conditioners is chilled by two Noske Kaeser refrigerators. An oil-fired hot-water boiler, made by the same company, provides the ship's heating, whereas the hot water for the galley and messes comes from a 600-litre, 45 kilowatt electric geyser.|$|R
