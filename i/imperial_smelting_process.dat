40|$|Previous {{research}} on the oxidation of coke in air, O 2 and CO 2 has been reviewed, {{especially with regard to}} kinetic studies and Zn/Pb blast furnace practice. Coke "reactivity" has been discussed and correlated with surface area changes on carbon burn-off (in air and CO 2 at various temperatures) for Nauitgarw and two other metallurgical cokes. Other carbons (charcoals and graphite) and a-brovnr. coal char~ have been examined by gas sorption, X ray diffraction and thermal analysis in an attempt to relate reactivity, as determined by rate of reaction in CO 2 at 1000 °C, with other solid state properties. Reactivity studies on coal chars have been reviewed also. The inhibition of the Boudouard reaction, by modification of the carbon surface, has been reviewed, especially by the action of'B 203. Cokes and coal char have been subject to B 2 O 3 solution treatment and the mode of action of the inhibitor investigated by isothermal and dynamic thermal analysis and estimation of surface area by gravimetric gas sorption. The action of B 2 O 3 at both low and high degree of carbon burn o f f has been studied. The mineral matter of coke (which forms about 10 % by weight of the material) and the coal char (which forms about 2 %) has been examined by X ray diffraction, optical and electron microscopy and thermal and chemical analysis. Its affect upon the kinetics of oxidation has been investigated. Results have been discussed in relation to the industrial usage of coke in the Zn/Pb blast furnace.

40|$|Previous {{research}} on the precipitation and oxidation of lead sulphide has been reviewed especially in relation to thermodynamic and kinetic studies. Samples of lead sulphide have been precipitated from aqueous solutions of lead salts under varying conditions of pH, concentration, temperature and time of ageing. The precipitates were examined by optical and electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and gas sorption analysis. Their crystallinity, particle size and phase composition have been correlated with the conditions of precipitation. The oxidation of selected samples of precipitated and commercial lead sulphide was investigated by thermal analysis and the above techniques. The phase composition of the oxidation products were studied under varying conditions of temperature, gas flow rate and oxygen content of air. For the low temperature oxidation (~ 500 °C) {{the thickness of the}} lead sulphate product layer was estimated and attempts made to correlate this value with the kinetics of the oxidation. The stability of lead sulphate at high temperature (~ 900 °C) has been investigated. Sintering behaviour of the products in relation to their incomplete desulphurization was examined. Oxidation studies on lead sulphide were extended to lead-zinc ores with respect to the effect of moisture content and bentonite on sintering. This investigation was carried out on a sinter pallet using 22 kg mixes at ISP Research Department of <b>Imperial</b> <b>Smelting</b> <b>Processes</b> Limited, Avonmouth. The possible formation of lead sulphite as an intermediate in the low temperature oxidation of lead sulphide was investigated by studying the thermal stability of the sulphide under various gaseous atmospheres. These studies were extended to zinc sulphite in relation to previous studies on the oxidation of zinc sulphide. These researches form a part of a wider study in the oxidation of sulphides during shipment, storage and processing...|$|R

50|$|At {{the same}} time, the mineral grain {{size of the}} lead-zinc ore mined and {{processed}} at Mount Isa was decreasing, making it harder to separate the lead and zinc minerals. The liberation of sphalerite (zinc sulfide) grains dropped from over 70% to just over 50% between 1984 and 1991. As a result, the Mount Isa lead-zinc concentrator was forced to produce a bulk concentrate {{from the beginning of}} 1986 until late 1996. Bulk concentrates cannot be treated in electrolytic zinc smelters, due to their lead content, and are typically treated in blast furnaces using the <b>Imperial</b> <b>Smelting</b> <b>Process.</b> The <b>Imperial</b> <b>Smelting</b> <b>Process</b> has higher operating costs than the more common electrolytic zinc process, and therefore the payment received by producers of bulk concentrate is lower than that received for separate lead and zinc concentrates. The zinc in the Mount Isa bulk concentrate was eventually worth less than half that of the zinc in the zinc concentrate.|$|E

40|$|The phase equilibria in the Fe-Zn-O {{system in}} the range 900 - 1580 degreesC in air have been {{experimentally}} studied using equilibration and quenching techniques. The compositions of the phases at equilibrium were determined using electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA).

The XRD analysis and the composition measurements both indicate that zincite is the only phase stable in the ZnO-rich area in the range of conditions investigated. The solubility of the iron oxide in zincite rapidly increases at temperatures above 1200 degreesC; the morphology of the zincite crystals also sharply changes between 1200 and 1300 degreesC from rounded to plate-like crystals. The plate-like zincite forms a refractory network-the type of microstructure beneficial to the <b>Imperial</b> <b>Smelting</b> <b>Process</b> (ISP) sinter performance.
