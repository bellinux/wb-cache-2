25|$|The Luftwaffe {{was much}} better {{prepared}} for the task of air-sea rescue than the RAF, specifically tasking the Seenotdienst unit, equipped with about 30 Heinkel He 59 floatplanes, with picking up downed aircrew from the North Sea, English Channel and the Dover Straits. In addition, Luftwaffe aircraft were equipped with life rafts and the aircrew were provided with sachets of a chemical called fluorescein which, on reacting with water, created a large, easy-to-see, bright <b>green</b> <b>patch.</b> In accordance with the Geneva Convention, the He 59s were unarmed and painted white with civilian registration markings and red crosses. Nevertheless, RAF aircraft attacked these aircraft, as some were escorted by Bf 109s.|$|E
25|$|From a distance, the drakes in nuptial plumage appear grey, {{with a dark}} head, a {{yellowish}} behind, and a white stripe {{running along}} the flanks. Their head and upper neck is chestnut, with a wide and iridescent dark <b>green</b> <b>patch</b> of half-moon- or teardrop-shape that starts immediately before the eye and arcs to the upper hindneck. The patch is bordered with thin yellowish-white lines, and a single line of that colour extends from the patch's forward end, curving along {{the base of the}} bill. The breast is buff with small round brown spots. The center of the belly is white, {{and the rest of the}} body plumage is mostly white with thin and dense blackish vermiculations, appearing medium grey even at a short distance. The outer scapular feathers are white, with a black border to the outer vanes, and form the white side-stripe when the bird is in resting position. The primary remiges are dark greyish brown; the speculum feathers are iridescent blackish-green with white tips, and form the speculum together with the yellowish-white tips of the larger upperwing coverts (which are otherwise grey). The underwing is whitish, with grey remiges, dense dark spotting on the inner coverts and a dark leading edge. The tail and tail coverts are black, with a bright yellowish-buff triangular patch in the center of the coverts at each side.|$|E
500|$|In a brief description, William Guilfoyle {{recorded}} a variegated fig from New South Wales [...] "12â€“15ft high" [...] in 1911 as F. rubiginosa variety variegata. A variegated form is in cultivation on Australia's east coast, {{and in the}} United States. It is a chimera lacking in chlorophyll in the second layer of the leaf meristem. The leaves have an irregular central <b>green</b> <b>patch</b> along the midvein with irregular yellow and green elsewhere. Leaves that grow in winter generally have larger green patches than those that do in summer. The chimera is unstable, and branches of all-green growth appear sporadically.|$|E

500|$|Nashville's current uniforms, {{adopted in}} 2015, utilize the team's red, black, and {{platinum}} silver color palette and incorporate elements that reflect Nashville's [...] "Music City" [...] moniker. Home uniforms consist of white jerseys with single lines of red piping around the sleeve openings {{and up the}} front going around the neck. The word [...] "Sounds" [...] is sewn on the chest in red letters surrounded by platinum silver and black which resemble the sound holes on a guitar. A patch of a red, silver, black, and white guitar shown hitting a baseball {{is located on the}} left sleeve. An green Oakland Athletics elephant logo is sewn on the right sleeve. From mid-August 2017 through the 2018 season, a two-tone <b>green</b> <b>patch</b> {{in the shape of the}} state of Tennessee bearing the letters [...] "FYKE" [...] will be worn on the left shoulder in memoriam of Jim Fyke, a Metro government employee and state official who played an integral role in securing a new Sounds ballpark. The player's last name is sewn on the back in black block characters, and his number is displayed below his name in red sound-hole lettering with a silver border and black drop shadow. White pants with a single line of red piping going up the sides are worn with black belts and black socks. The home cap is solid black with the primary [...] "N" [...] guitar pick logo. Batting helmets are glossy black with the same [...] "N" [...] pick logo. Road uniforms are identical to those worn for home games with only a few exceptions: jerseys and pants are made from gray material, [...] "Nashville" [...] is written across the chest instead of [...] "Sounds", pants have no pinstripes, and the cap bears a guitar pick logo with an [...] "S" [...] in place of an [...] "N".|$|E
2500|$|Facebook {{launched}} the Facebook Platform on May 24, 2007, providing {{a framework for}} software developers to create applications that interact with core Facebook's features. A markup language called Facebook Markup Language was introduced simultaneously; {{it is used to}} customize the [...] "look and feel" [...] of applications that developers create. Using the Platform, Facebook launched several new applications, including Gifts, allowing users to send virtual gifts to each other, Marketplace, allowing users to post free classified ads, Events, giving users a method of informing their friends about upcoming events, Video, letting users share homemade videos with one another, and social network game, where users can use their connections to friends to help them advance in games they are playing. [...] Many of the popular early social network games would combine capabilities. [...] For instance, one of the early games to reach the top application spot, (Lil) <b>Green</b> <b>Patch,</b> combined virtual Gifts with Event notifications to friends and contributions to charities through Causes.|$|E

60|$|The little hamlet, Glaze, a {{white and}} <b>green</b> <b>patch</b> {{in the vast}} waste of purple, lay miles down a slope much like the Cottonwoods slope, only this descended to the west.

60|$|Early in the {{afternoon}} from a ridge-top Duane sighted Fairdale, a <b>green</b> <b>patch</b> in the mass of gray. For the barrens of Texas it was indeed a fair sight. But he was more concerned with its remoteness from civilization than its beauty. At that time, in the early seventies, when the vast western third of Texas was a wilderness, the pioneer had done wonders to settle there and establish places like Fairdale.|$|E
60|$|Man, however, was not {{altogether}} absent, though less obviously present, at that time. At the extreme {{western end of}} the lake, where {{the view of the}} regions beyond was most extensive as well as most beautiful, there was a bright <b>green</b> <b>patch</b> of land, free from underwood as well as trees-- a sort of natural lawn--which extended with a gentle slope towards the lake; ending in a pebbly beach on which the waters rested so calm and pure that it was difficult to distinguish the line where dry land and water met.|$|E

60|$|All the woodland, up and down, {{appeared}} to be richer greener as they traveled farther west. Grass grew thick and heavy. Water ran in all ravines. The rocks were bronze and copper and russet, and some had <b>green</b> <b>patches</b> of lichen.|$|R
60|$|I looked round, with a {{chill of}} fear in my heart, at the huge {{swelling}} plain, mottled with the <b>green</b> <b>patches</b> of rushes. Nothing stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which croaked loudly from a tor behind us.|$|R
60|$|I {{got out to}} {{see about}} some tea for my {{traveling}} companions, {{and looked up at}} the outside passengers. One of them seated in the dickey looked down at me. He was a countryman in a smock-frock, with a <b>green</b> <b>patch</b> over one of his eyes. Something in the expression of his uncovered eye made me pause--reflect--turn away uneasily--and then look again at him furtively. A sudden shudder ran through me from top to toe; my heart sank; and my head began to feel giddy. The countryman in the dickey was no other than the Bow Street runner in disguise.|$|E
60|$|Pan {{passed the}} first farmhouse. Beyond {{that he could}} make out only a <b>green</b> <b>patch,</b> where he judged lay the home he was hunting. His buoyant step {{swallowed}} up the rods. Cattle and horses grazed in a pasture. The road turned to the right, round the slope of a low hill. Pan's quick eye caught a column of curling blue smoke that rose from a grove of trees. The house would be in there. Pasture, orchard, cornfield, ragged and uncut, a grove of low trees with thick foliage, barns and corrals he noted with appreciative enthusiasm. The place did not have the bareness characteristic of a ranch.|$|E
60|$|Years have {{rolled away}} since {{the song and}} shout of the fur-trader first awakened the echoes of Ungava. Its general aspect is still the same, for there is {{no change in the}} {{everlasting}} hills. In summer the deer still wander down the dark ravines and lave their flanks in the river's swelling tide, and in winter the frost-smoke still darkens the air and broods above the open water of the sea; but Fort Chimo, the joy and wonder of the Esquimaux and the hope of the fur-trader, is gone, and a <b>green</b> <b>patch</b> of herbage near the flat rock beside the spring alone remains to mark the spot where once it stood.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the wartime}} change to lower-visibility {{insignia}} enlisted collar patches were woven in matte [...] "mouse-grey" [...] with field-grey stripes, which were at first sewn to <b>green</b> collar <b>patches</b> as before but increasingly {{directly to the}} collar, which beginning in 1940 was made in feldgrau like the uniform; grey collar patches were never produced.

50|$|Roboastra luteolineata {{is quite}} large in {{comparison}} to most other sea-slugs. It is black, with yellow lines running lengthwise down the body.

60|$|Then, {{with his}} back against a stone, Venters faced the east, and, stick in hand and idle blade, he waited. The glorious {{sunlight}} filled the valley with purple fire. Before him, to left, to right, waving, rolling, sinking, rising, like low swells of a purple sea, stretched the sage. Out of the grove of cottonwoods, a <b>green</b> <b>patch</b> on the purple, gleamed the dull red of Jane Withersteen's old stone house. And from there extended the wide green of the village gardens and orchards marked by the graceful poplars; and farther down shone the deep, dark richness of the alfalfa fields. Numberless red and black and white dots speckled the sage, and these were cattle and horses.|$|E
6000|$|The ruffian {{whom the}} waiter {{at the inn}} on the bridge saw 'about to join' the youth and the King did not exactly join them, but fell in close behind them and {{followed}} their steps. He said nothing. His left arm was in a sling, and he wore a large <b>green</b> <b>patch</b> over his left eye; he limped slightly, and used an oaken staff as a support. The youth led the King a crooked course through Southwark, and by-and-by struck into the high road beyond. The King was irritated, now, {{and said he would}} stop here--it was Hendon's place to come to him, not his to go to Hendon. He would not endure such insolence; he would stop where he was. The youth said-- ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} daybreak {{when he had}} reached this decision, and he at once arose. He locked up the house and {{went out into the}} <b>green</b> <b>patch</b> which merged in heather further on. In front of the white garden-palings the path {{branched}} into three like a broad-arrow. The road to the right led to the Quiet Woman and its neighbourhood; the middle track led to Mistover Knap; the left-hand track led over the hill to another part of Mistover, where the child lived. On inclining into the latter path Yeobright felt a creeping chilliness, familiar enough to most people, and probably caused by the unsunned morning air. In after days he thought of it as a thing of singular significance.|$|E
