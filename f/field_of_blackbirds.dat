5000|$|Kosovo (Serbian Cyrillic: Косово) is the Serbian neuter possessive {{adjective}} of kos (кос) [...] "blackbird", {{from the}} ancient Greek kοssyfos (κόσσυφος, blackbird) an ellipsis for the Byzantine Gr. toponym Kossyfopedion (the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>blackbirds).</b> In Serbian is known as Kosovo Polje [...] "field of the blackbirds", {{the site of the}} 1389 Battle of Kosovo Field. The name of the field was applied to an Ottoman province created in 1864. In Greek the full name of the historical region is Kossyfopèdio meaning field (-pèdio) of the blackbirds (Kossyfi-).|$|E

He curses the Balkans for forcing him to rest on their land, rather than the land he calls home. As the centuries pass, the Sultan notes that rather than {{attempting}} to unite and [...] "build something together" [...] the Albanians and Serbians continue to wage wars over Kosovo.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the ability of pole-bound hawk-kites to protect maturing <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> corn from <b>blackbird</b> damage. Hawk-kites were placed over half <b>of</b> each experimental <b>field.</b> Damage on the hawk-kite side was slightly, but not significantly, less than on the unprotected side {{as measured by the}} percent of ears damaged by birds, total amount of grain lost to birds, or percent of crop damaged by birds. Bird damage on the hawk-kite side <b>of</b> the experimental <b>fields</b> also did not differ significantly from nearby control fields. Four different types of hawk-kites, which differed in size, design, and in the raptor species printed on them, were used in this study. None of them differed significantly in their ability to reduce bird damage. All of the pole-bound hawk-kites also required considerable labor to keep them in repair. Consequently, their use was not found to be cost-effective in these experiments...|$|R

5|$|Common <b>blackbirds</b> {{spend much}} <b>of</b> their time looking for {{food on the}} ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are {{external}} parasites that most commonly attach to the head <b>of</b> a <b>blackbird.</b> In France, 74% <b>of</b> rural <b>blackbirds</b> {{were found to be}} infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% <b>of</b> <b>blackbirds</b> living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly because it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness <b>of</b> <b>blackbirds</b> except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|R

50|$|Virtually all of North America's raptors take adult {{or young}} red-winged blackbirds, even barn owls, which usually only take small mammals, and {{northern}} saw-whet owls, which are scarcely {{larger than a}} male red-winged.

Crows, ravens, magpies and herons are occasionally predators <b>of</b> <b>blackbird</b> nests. Additional predators <b>of</b> <b>blackbirds</b> <b>of</b> all ages and their eggs include raccoons, mink, foxes and snakes, especially the rat snake.

It is clear that blackbirds can exacerbate levels of risk for failures in agricultural biosecurity and human health. To what degree these levels of risk are raised is largely unknown and should be the focus of future studies because this information will prove vital in the assessment of management options...|$|R
