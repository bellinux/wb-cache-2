Heat exchange using CO 2 gas has recently been proposed for the secondary sodium loop of the sodium fast reactor being developed in Korea because of the strong chemical reaction between liquid sodium and water. A DC conduction-type <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>pump</b> with {{a rectangular}} channel was selected to circulate liquid sodium in the experimental test loop for the sodium&# 8211;CO 2 reaction. Electromagnetic force, which was generated by the Lorentz force of an electrical equivalent circuit, was used to drive the liquid sodium.

40|$|The first {{challenge}} of this proposed {{study was the}} gauges for the loop, which were not functioning properly and giving off inaccurate data due to a loop flow issue. Therefore a new loop design, including gauges, was created to gather accurate data for the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>pump.</b> The <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>pump</b> used in this experiment differs from the standard electromagnetic motors by using rare earth magnets set into opposing steel plates that rotate simultaneously. Accurate data from the velocity and pressure gauges is necessary so {{the correlation between the}} EM pumpâ€™s speed and the flow velocity could be calculated. This technology could be advantageous to industries using metal transportation, by saving both money and time for industries. A loop for molten metal must be created so that differential pressure and flow rate can be tracked accurately. This can be found through the use of research, model development, and previous design work. To accomplish this task, SolidWorks was used to create models of the molten metal loop to be built. Based on this data, the design was manufactured and tested to ensure it can accurately gather data. The important outcomes for this project were to develop correlations between the flux generated by the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>pump</b> and the RPMs. If this was achieved, then the possible incorporation of a Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) system will be incorporated to analyze the different compositions (contaminations) of the molten metal in the loop.
