5|$|Kermes {{is a red}} dye {{from the}} dried bodies of the females of a scale insect in the genus Kermes, {{primarily}} Kermes vermilio. Kermes are native to the Mediterranean region, living on the sap of the Kermes oak. They were used as a red dye by the ancient Greeks and Romans. The kermes dye is a rich red, and has good colour <b>fastness</b> in silk and wool.|$|E
5|$|The {{photostability}} of pigments can {{be enhanced}} {{by the addition of}} cerium. It provides pigments with light <b>fastness</b> and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight. Television glass plates are subject to electron bombardment, which tends to darken them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of cerium oxide. Cerium is also an essential component of phosphors used in TV screens and fluorescent lamps. Cerium sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable up to 350°C. The pigment is a nontoxic alternative to cadmium sulfide pigments.|$|E
25|$|CdS {{is used as}} pigment in plastics, showing good thermal stability, {{light and}} weather <b>fastness,</b> {{chemical}} resistance and high opacity. As a pigment, CdS is known as cadmium yellow. (CI pigment yellow 37) About 2000 tons are produced annually as of 1982, representing about 25% of the cadmium processed commercially.|$|E

25|$|Both the replica and the {{original}} were damaged by fires at Chūgū-ji in the early fourteenth century, but the damaged pieces were preserved and {{in the nineteenth century}} were combined together to create the current version. The colour <b>fastness</b> of {{the original}} material was superior to that of the later replica; in the extant version of the artwork, the brighter sections are all derived from the original.|$|E
25|$|Finally, cotton is an {{absorbent}} fibre which responds {{readily to}} colouration processes. Dyeing, for instance, is commonly {{carried out with}} an anionic direct dye by completely immersing the fabric (or yarn) in an aqueous dyebath according to a prescribed procedure. For improved <b>fastness</b> to washing, rubbing and light, other dyes such as vats and reactives are commonly used. These require more complex chemistry during processing and are thus more expensive to apply.|$|E
25|$|At the time, all dyes {{used for}} {{colouring}} cloth were natural substances, {{many of which}} were expensive and labour-intensive to extract. Furthermore, many lacked stability, or <b>fastness.</b> The colour purple, which had been a mark of aristocracy and prestige since ancient times, was especially expensive and difficult to produce — the dye used, known as Tyrian purple, was made from the glandular mucus of certain molluscs. Its extraction was variable and complicated, and so Perkin and his brother realised that they had discovered a possible substitute whose production could be commercially successful.|$|E

25|$|Ormonde's Royalists {{still held}} most of Munster, but were outflanked by a mutiny {{of their own}} {{garrison}} in Cork. The British Protestant troops there had been fighting for the Parliament up to 1648 and resented fighting with the Irish Confederates. Their mutiny handed Cork and most of Munster to Cromwell and they defeated the local Irish garrison at the Battle of Macroom. The Irish and Royalist forces retreated behind the River Shannon into Connacht or (in {{the case of the}} remaining Munster forces) into the <b>fastness</b> of Kerry.|$|E
25|$|Safe in his {{mountain}} <b>fastness</b> Rajasingha now {{adopted the}} same tactics he had deployed against the Portuguese to harass the Dutch. In 1660 his army {{is known to}} have been in the vicinity of Dutch-held Trincomalee, and seized the Englishman Robert Knox. Knox subsequently moved to Senkadagala and lived there until 1679; his writings provide one of the best sources on the Kandyan kingdom in the 17th century. Rajasingha may also have considered involving the French in Sri Lankan politics in an attempt to get yet another European power to displace the Dutch.|$|E
25|$|To the north-west of Bowfell {{the main}} ridge {{drops to the}} {{depression}} of Ore Gap, named after its reddish soil, rich in haematite. Below the col on the northern side is Angle Tarn. This round waterbody occupies a corrie beneath Hanging Knotts, small trout lurking in its 50ft depths. Its outflow is {{a tributary of the}} Langstrath Beck, making for Stonethwaite. To the south of Ore Gap runs Yeastyrigg Gill, the main headwater of Lingcove Beck, flowing into the <b>fastness</b> of upper Eskdale. Beyond the Gap the ridge makes the stony three-tiered climb to the white-rocked summit of Esk Pike.|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} work, conventional and ultrasonic treatments on exhaust dyeing of natural Luffa cylindrical (LC) fibres with reactive dyes were studied. Accordingly, {{the samples were}} alkali scoured, bleached with H 2 O 2 and dyed with C. I. Reactive Red 241 and C. I. Reactive Blue 19 at 60 C, 60 min with or without ultrasonic energy. The colouristic properties, penetration behaviour and colour <b>fastnesses</b> were investigated and compared with each other. Using ultrasonic energy for dyeing LC fibres enhances the exhaustion of dye, good colouristic properties and colour <b>fastnesses</b> in dyeings are achieved. The ultrasonic power seems promising since it enhances colour yields and reduces process time...|$|R

25|$|As the war began, the Dwarves of Erebor {{refused to}} co-operate with Sauron in his {{hunt for the}} Ring. Therefore, Sauron sent an army of Easterlings to Dale. On 17 March they met the armies of the Dwarves and the Men of Dale. After three days of fighting, Men and Dwarves were overrun and sought refuge in Erebor. King Brand of Dale fell before the gate of Erebor, and King under the Mountain Dáin II Ironfoot fell as he was {{defending}} Brand's body. Many Men and Dwarves made their escape to Erebor however, {{and were able to}} withstand the siege of the mountain <b>fastness.</b> When news spread about the victory in the South, the Easterlings scattered and the sons of Brand and Dáin led their army out of Erebor.|$|E

He pays the <b>fastness</b> for a foretelling, an art practiced to prove the [...] "perfect uselessness of knowing {{the answer to the}} wrong question". He asks if Gethen/Winter will {{be a member of the}} Ekumen in five years, expecting that the foretellers will give him an ambiguous response, but he is answered [...] "yes". This leads him to muse that the Gethenians have [...] "trained hunch to run in harness". After several months of travelling through Karhide, Ai decides to pursue his mission in Orgoreyn, to which he has received an invitation.|$|E

2500|$|This {{contrasts}} {{sharply with}} the naivety of prime minister Bhimsen Thapa – [...] " ... our hills and <b>fastness</b> are formed by the hand of God, and are impregnable." [...] This stance by Bhimsen Thapa is not surprising, as insinuated by Amar Singh, considering Amar Singh had made the usurpations in Butwal and Sheoraj, and whose family derived most of the advantages. Prinsep estimates that the revenue of the usurped lands {{could not have been}} less than a lakh of rupees a year to the Nepalese, in the manner they collected it: the retention of this income was therefore an object of no small importance to the ambitious views of Bhimsen Thapa and the preservation of the influence he had contrived to establish for his family. The Nepalese prime minister realized the Nepalese had several advantages over the British including knowledge of the region and recent experience fighting in the mountainous terrain. However, the British had numerical superiority and far more modern weapons.|$|E

2500|$|Southward {{from the}} summit, Esk Pike throws {{out a long}} {{descending}} ridge into the uninhabited <b>fastness</b> of Upper Eskdale. This divides the Esk from its major upper tributary, Lingcove Beck, which has its beginnings at Ore Gap. Two miles in length, this ridge falls over a series of craggy steps to {{the confluence of the}} two streams at Lingcove Bridge. An old Packhorse Bridge, [...] this is a focal point for those approaching from the south, particularly when the Esk is in spate. The south ridge has a number of subsidiary tops which are recognised by some guidebooks, the principal summits being Pike de Bield (2,657ft / 810 m.), Scar Lathing (1,440ft / 439 m.) and Throstlehow Crag (1,325ft / 404 m.). Scar Lathing is particularly impressive, presenting sheer cliffs above a bend in the Esk. Although of minor significance Pianet Knott on {{the eastern side of the}} ridge also has a very striking appearance from lower down the valley.|$|E
2500|$|Everybody was {{influenced}} {{at the time}} by Arturo Toscanini - {{it was easy to}} understand {{what he was trying to}} do: you didn't need any reference to spiritual dimension. There was a certain order in the way the music was presented. With Toscanini I never felt anything spiritual. With Furtwängler on the other hand, I understood that there I was confronted by something completely different: metaphysics, transcendence, the relationship between sounds and sonorities [...] Furtwängler was not only a musician, he was a creator [...] What happens to those who don't understand the manifold variety of musical performance? Who are unable to hear that famous astral octave because they are deaf to music? Then their integration is related only to a part of a musical score, to the least important one, the raw material. But that's precisely what music is not about [...] Then you find each tempo too slow. Because the slowness or <b>fastness</b> are determined by the complexity of these musical manifestations. Furtwängler had the ear for it: not the physical ear, but the spiritual ear that captures these parallel movements.|$|E
2500|$|To add to {{the mystery}} {{surrounding}} the first American flag, experts can only guess the reason Congress chose stripes, stars, and the colors red, white, and blue for the flag. Historians and experts discredit the common theory that the stripes and five-pointed stars derived from the Washington family coat of arms. While this theory adds to Washington's legendary involvement {{in the development of}} the first flag, no evidence other than the obvious one that his coat of arms, like the Stars and Stripes, has stars and stripes in it exists to show any connection between the two. Washington was aware that [...] "most admire ... the trappings of elevated office," [...] but for himself claimed [...] "To me there is nothing in it." [...] However, he frequently used (for example, as his bookplate) his family coat of arms with three five-pointed red stars and three red-and-white stripes, on which is based the flag of the District of Columbia. The use of red and blue in flags at this time in history may derive from the relative <b>fastness</b> of the dyes indigo and cochineal, providing blue and red colors respectively, as aniline dyes were unknown.|$|E
