An inhibitor to {{the enzyme}} lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (5, 5 '-dithionitrobenzoic acid) was added in some experiments to prevent modification of substrate-lipids contained in secreted lipoproteins.

The major apoprotein of these discoidal fractions had the same electrophoretic mobility as the arginine-rich apoprotein, whereas plasma <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins contained mainly the A-I approtein. In all these respects the discoidal perfusate <b>high</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins closely resemble those found in human plasma which is deficient in lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase.
