The Dutch took over the studio, and production of newsreels at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce fictional films.

5|$|Although {{produced}} by Universal Pictures, The Brute Man was distributed by Producers Releasing Corporation, {{one of the}} smaller film studios from Hollywood's Poverty Row. In 1945, Universal merged with the company International Pictures, and the new organization adopted a policy against developing any more B movies, including Westerns, horror films, serials and movies running 70minutes or less. This resulted in the firing of numerous production personnel members and the sale of several already-developed films, including The Brute Man. The sale was also perpetuated <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> death of star Rondo Hatton. He {{died as a result of}} his acromegaly on February2, 1946, about eight months before The Brute Man was first screened, making it his final film. Universal feared releasing the film so soon after his death would lead to accusations that the studio was exploiting the illness that ultimately killed Hatton. Now embarrassed by the film, the studio was anxious to sell it.|$|E

5|$|Decommissioned in 1949, {{the fort}} {{was used for}} a time as a {{storehouse}} for a shoe factory before it was purchased by the local council. The surrounding land was developed into a public park but the fort itself fell into dereliction, despite its historical and architectural significance.

As a condition of its assistance, the World Bank insisted that 80% of oil revenues be spent on development projects.

On 14 July 2006, the World Bank and Chad signed a memorandum of understanding under which the Government of Chad commits 70% of its spending to priority poverty reduction programmes.|$|E
