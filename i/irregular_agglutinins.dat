40|$|From some {{observations}} {{made with}} immune sera, and {{particularly from the}} evidence provided by tests with occasionally occurring normal and post-transfusion human sera containing <b>irregular</b> <b>agglutinins</b> (cf. reviews in 1, 2) one can conclude that there exist individual properties of human blood other than those which are demonstrable by readily available reagents such as A 1, A 2, B, M, N. Doubtless numerous {{attempts have been made}} to discover additional agglutinogens by the familiar technique used for the demonstration of the factors M and N (3), that is, with immune sera prepared by the injection of human blood into rabbits, but only few results were obtained (e. g. 4, 5), and these were not followed up because it was difficult to produce the immune sera again. Other ways of approaching the problem were therefore desirable and it was thought that new results might be obtained by immunizing with animal instead of human blood, considering that the blood of some animals contains antigens related to agglutinogens present in individual human bloods, for instance the Forssman substance related to A in sheep cells. A result that favored this plan was th...|$|E
