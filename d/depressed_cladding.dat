Their capability for high output power, with high efficiency, has been demonstrated both in CW and pulsed regimes. Cladding-pumped Yb-doped fiber lasers have now reached beyond kW levels with good beam quality. Advances in both fiber technology and high-power multimode diode pump sources, and the inherent power scalability of cladding-pumped fibers, lie behind this power surge.

40|$|S-band (1480 ~ 1520 nm) {{has been}} {{recently}} studied {{as a new}} frequency band for fiber-optic communication. So far, the most promising S-band EDFAs employ the EDFs with <b>depressed</b> inner <b>cladding</b> to achieve fundamental-mode cutoff λc at the longer wavelengths [1]. The <b>depressed</b> inner <b>cladding</b> in EDFs modifies the waveguide dispersion, which in terms varies the refractive index dispersion (RID) n(λ) curves. The effective indices of the longer (shorter) wavelengths become lower (higher) than the index of the outer silica cladding respectively. The ASE at the longer wavelengths can then be substantially suppressed {{so that in the}} shorter wavelengths (S-band) higher population inversion and sufficient amplification can be obtained. The λc can be tuned toward shorter wavelengths by bending the fiber and the total distributed loss for wavelengths longer than the λc can be> 200 dB through an entire 15 -m-long EDF. However, a specially designed EDF is required for S-band amplification and the cutoff efficiency and insertion loss become worse and higher, respectively, when the radius of bending curvature gradually decreases [1]. In contrast to the λc induced by waveguide dispersion, we have demonstrated widely tunable (1250 ~ 1650 nm) side-polished fiber short-pass filters based on material dispersion [2]. The λc is thermo-optically tunable (no moving part) and the high cutoff efficiency (deep stopband and sharp filter skirt) can still be maintained while tuning to different wavelengths.
