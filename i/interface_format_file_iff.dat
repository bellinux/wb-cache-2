50|$|Interchange <b>File</b> <b>Format</b> (<b>IFF),</b> is {{a generic}} {{container}} <b>file</b> <b>format</b> originally {{introduced by the}} Electronic Arts company in 1985 (in cooperation with Commodore/Amiga) {{in order to facilitate}} transfer of data between software produced by different companies.|$|R
50|$|Audio Interchange <b>File</b> <b>Format</b> (AIFF) is {{an audio}} <b>file</b> <b>format</b> {{standard}} used for storing sound data for personal {{computers and other}} electronic audio devices. The format was developed by Apple Inc. in 1988 based on Electronic Arts' Interchange <b>File</b> <b>Format</b> (<b>IFF,</b> widely used on Amiga systems) and is most commonly used on Apple Macintosh computer systems.|$|R
5000|$|The NRG <b>file</b> <b>format</b> uses a {{variation}} of the Interchange <b>File</b> <b>Format</b> (<b>IFF)</b> and stores data in a chain of [...] "chunks". All integer values are stored unsigned in big endian byte order. Version 1 NRG format stores values as 32-bit integers. Nero Burning ROM v5.5 introduced a new NRG <b>file</b> <b>format,</b> version 2, with support for 64-bit integers.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, Electronic Arts {{introduced}} the Interchange <b>File</b> <b>Format</b> (<b>IFF)</b> meta-format (family of <b>file</b> <b>formats),</b> originally devised {{for use on}} the Amiga. These files consisted of a sequence of [...] "chunks", which could contain arbitrary data, each chunk prefixed by a four-byte ID. The IFF specification explicitly mentions that {{the origins of the}} FourCC idea lie with Apple.|$|R

5000|$|The LBM file {{extension}} {{is an image}} file in Interchange <b>File</b> <b>Format</b> (<b>IFF)</b> structure to store image or palette data. Most commonly you can find these files in InterLeaved BitMap (ILBM) format, but some games are using a similar, but simpler-to-use Planar BitMap (PBM) format. Both formats commonly exist under the [...]lbm {{file extension}}, occasionally appearing also as [...]bbm extension.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{operating}} system using magic numbers is AmigaOS, where magic numbers were called [...] "Magic Cookies" [...] and were adopted {{as a standard}} system to recognize executables in Hunk executable <b>file</b> <b>format</b> and also to let single programs, tools and utilities deal automatically with their saved data files, or {{any other kind of}} file types when saving and loading data. This system was then enhanced with the Amiga standard Datatype recognition system. Another method was the FourCC method, originating in OSType on Macintosh, later adapted by Interchange <b>File</b> <b>Format</b> (<b>IFF)</b> and derivatives.|$|R
5000|$|Amiga {{software}} {{started its}} {{history with the}} 1985 Amiga 1000. Commodore International released the programming specifications and development computers to various software houses, prominently Electronic Arts, a software house that then offered Deluxe Paint, Deluxe Music and others. Electronic Arts also developed the Interchange <b>File</b> <b>Format</b> (<b>IFF)</b> <b>file</b> container, to store project files realized by Deluxe Paint and Deluxe Music. IFF became the de facto standard in AmigaOS. The first to be shown were digitizer software ProPaint (in early beta). Both were used by Andy Warhol to produce a black-and-white photo of Debbie Harry at the Launch Gala at Lincoln Center, New York City in July 1985. In 1985 Commodore licensed the software called Transformer from Simile Research {{and put it on}} the market in January 1986, bundled with an external A1020 5.25-inch floppy drive. It emulated 8086 Intel-based PC-XT hardware. It could run MS-DOS and MS-DOS software such as Lotus 123 or WordStar. This provided early access to many applications, while waiting for native Amiga software to be developed. In 1985, Deluxe Paint emerged with graphic features that had been available only on dedicated graphic computers. It was dubbed the first Amiga [...] "Killer application".|$|R

50|$|Hollywood was {{designed}} to be a completely platform independent programming language. Thus, scripts cannot call any API functions of the host operating system directly and are limited to the inbuilt command set. Text rendering is also implemented via a platform independent font backend that ensures that TrueType text looks exactly the same on every platform. Furthermore, all versions of Hollywood support Amiga specific <b>file</b> <b>formats</b> like <b>IFF</b> ILBM images, IFF 8SVX sounds, or <b>IFF</b> ANIM <b>files,</b> to be fully compatible with scripts written on an Amiga system.|$|R
5000|$|<b>IFF</b> <b>files</b> do {{not have}} any {{standard}} extension. On many systems that generate <b>IFF</b> <b>files,</b> file extensions are not important (the OS stores <b>file</b> <b>format</b> metadata separately from the file name). An [...] extension is commonly used for ILBM <b>format</b> <b>files,</b> which use the IFF container format.|$|R
40|$|Data of {{interest}} to biomedical researchers associated with the Human Genome Project (HGP) is stored {{all over the world}} {{in a number of different}} electronic data formats and accessible through a variety of interfaces and retrieval languages. These data sources include conventional relational databases with SQL <b>interfaces,</b> <b>formatted</b> text <b>files</b> on top of which indexing is provided for efficient retrieval (ASN. 1 -Entrez), and binary files that can be interpreted textually or graphically via special purpose interfaces (ACeDB). Researchers within the HGP want to combine data from these different data sources, add value through sophisticated data analysis techniques (such as the biosequence comparison software BLAST and FASTA), and view it using special purpose scientific visualization tools. However, currently there are no commercial tools for enabling such an integrated digital library, and a fundamental barrier to developing such tools appears to be one of language design and optimization: [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|One major {{uncompressed}} audio format, LPCM, is {{the same}} variety of PCM as used in Compact Disc Digital Audio and is the format most commonly accepted by low level audio APIs and D/A converter hardware. Although LPCM can be stored on a computer as a raw audio format, it is usually stored in a [...] file on Windows or in a [...] file on macOS. The AIFF format {{is based on the}} Interchange <b>File</b> <b>Format</b> (<b>IFF),</b> and the WAV format is based on the similar Resource Interchange <b>File</b> <b>Format</b> (RIFF). WAV and AIFF are designed to store a wide variety of audio formats, lossless and lossy; they just add a small, metadata-containing header before the audio data to declare the format of the audio data, such as LPCM with a particular sample rate, bit depth, endianness and number of channels. Since WAV and AIFF are widely supported and can store LPCM, they are suitable <b>file</b> <b>formats</b> for storing and archiving an original recording.|$|R

50|$|At {{about the}} same time, a group of {{third-party}} developers had met at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC '91) and tried to hammer out a standardized document format, based conceptually on the Electronic Arts Interchange <b>File</b> <b>Format</b> (<b>IFF).</b> Apple became interested in this work, and soon dedicated some engineers {{to the task of}} building, or at least documenting, such a system. Initial work was published on the WWDC CDs, {{as well as a number}} of follow-up versions on later developer CDs. A component document system would only work with a known document format that all the components could use, and so soon the standardized document format was pulled into the component software effort. The format quickly changed from a simple one using tags to a very complex object oriented persistence layer called Bento.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} a new MS/MS search algorithm for peptide identification from ETD spectra. Methods: SEQUEST Â® and a new algorithm were used for data analysis, and results were displayed using a beta version of the BioWorks â„¢ user <b>interface.</b> The. XML <b>format</b> <b>files</b> were also used to search ETD spectra with MASCOT â„¢ version 2. 2 using the ETD-TRAP instrument option. Results: The data pre-processing function of the new algorithm significantly reduces the number of spectra that need to be searched. The new algorithm demonstrates higher sensitivity and specificity than either SEQUEST or MASCOT for peptide identification with ETD spectra. The new algorithm generates higher deltaCn scores. This larger score difference between the first and the second best hits indicates that this algorithm is more discriminatory than either SEQUEST or MASCOT. ETD spectra database search using the new algorithm is less time consuming compared to SEQUEST...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept and}} details of implementation, user <b>interface,</b> and <b>file</b> <b>formats</b> of the Coarse-Graining OPTimization "CGOPT" (version 2. 0) {{software}} package are described. It enables {{the user to}} map a full-detailed atomistic model of a polymer system to a coarse-grained mesoscale model (roughly one bead per chemical repeat unit). The features include a control script, an implementation of the simplex algorithm and an implementation of a structure difference algorithm based on potential inversions from distribution functions. Taken together, this machinery is able to automatically modify and optimize the force field by way of user-selected potential functions for mesoscale polymer simulations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Content {{providers}} try {{to restrict}} the usage of their products by their customers {{in order to prevent}} unlicensed distribution. On the other hand, customers ignore these restrictions and share files for free (Gnutella). Content providers and content users treat one another as enemies with conflicting interests. In this paper we bring customers and providers of content back together to a common economic interest. Content providers support their customers to redistribute their products in that they pay for any re-distributed multimedia product a small percentage on commission. Customers have a choice to pay for a received copy or to use it freely. If they use it for free, they will get no commission on re-distribution. If they pay, they will become licensed re-distributors automatically. This paper describes a friendly peer-to-peer file-sharing model of customers, which brings profit to both, content providers and their customers.
