The United States Department of State was offering up to US$5 million for information leading to his arrest and/or conviction.

The broadcast was viewed by over 100 million viewers worldwide. He also made two appearances on Fox News, first on the TV special The Rescue Rumble and later on Your World, both shows were hosted by Neil Cavuto. He later appeared as a guest on the Comedy Central TV series The Colbert Report, a news satire show about modern American politics. According to Moore, the decision to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the show came from Stephen Colbert, the current host for the TV series. A spokeswoman from Comedy Central {{would not comment on}} the motives behind the selection. Moore also wrote several articles in The Nation, The New Republic and National Journal, and the newspapers The St. Petersburg Times, The Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune. The {{question of whether or not}} Barack Obama was a socialist, led to an increased interest in Moore during the election. The Left Party, a Swedish democratic socialist political party, officially endorsed Moore for president during a televised debate in Sweden.|$|E

25|$|Jarrett {{would then}} enter a feud with Mick Foley, who {{attacked}} him while shooting his DVD at the TNA Asylum. The two would {{meet in a}} four-way match at Sacrifice involving Kurt Angle and Sting with Jarrett putting his voting shares in TNA on the line, Angle putting his leadership of The Main Event Mafia, Sting putting his career, and Foley putting the TNA World Heavyweight Championship; Sting {{would go on to}} pin Angle for the victory and leadership of the mafia. Jarrett later pinned Eric Young in order to qualify for the King of the Mountain match, however Young attacked Jarrett after the match in storyline. The following week, Jarrett called out Young and offered to turn the other cheek, but instead Young provoked him by saying that he pays more attention to wrestling than his own daughters just like his father Jerry which resulted in Jarrett slapping Young and assaulting him. Jarrett also would accidentally punch referee Earl Hebner while Hebner was trying to separate the two. On the June 11 episode of Impact!, Mick Foley kayfabe fined and suspended Jarrett and threw him out of the arena as a punishment. The following week, Foley threw a party for Jarrett and welcomed his return to TNA in order to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> his side at Slammiversary. At Slammiversary, Jarrett refused to give Foley the belt in the King of the Mountain match, which was won by Kurt Angle after assistance from Samoa Joe. Shortly after Slammiversary, Jarrett once again disappeared from TNA programming. During his hiatus, it was reported that Jarrett had lost all of his backstage power in TNA and would return only as a wrestler.|$|E

Manager Adrian Pennock stated that [...] "He's come to play football, he's not come {{for money and}} I'm chuffed to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> board. He has the {{experience}} we need and I believe he'll score goals." [...] He made his debut six days later in a 1–1 draw with Hereford United at The New Lawn. On 25 January, he scored his first goals for the club, securing a brace in a 3–0 home win over Chester.|$|E

From day one I felt at home here. I'm {{fortunate enough to have}} played in all the divisions and I see this as the next step of my journey." [...] The Bradford manager, Stuart McCall also revealed that Rehman had taken a large pay cut by joining the club, adding, [...] "Zesh is certainly not signing for Bradford for money—he wants to be a success here, and it will be great to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> board."

500|$|After making Hard Boiled in Hong Kong, {{director}} John Woo {{decided to}} take an offer {{to work in the}} United States, where he would find himself happier as a filmmaker with a preferable work pace and working with more reasonable hours. Woo was first offered this job in the United States by Universal Pictures chairman Tom Pollock after he had seen Woo's film The Killer. Universal was not eager to have Woo direct an entire feature and only agreed after what producer James Jacks called a [...] "difficult period of convincing". Universal was worried about having an Asian director on set who had limited command of English on a large scale project. They hired American director Sam Raimi to oversee the film's production and to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> standby if Woo was not able to fulfill his role as a director. Raimi was very excited to work with Woo as he was fan of his Hong Kong films. Raimi was also confident in Woo's directorial skills, stating that [...] "Woo at 70% is still going to blow away most American action directors working at 100%." ...|$|E
500|$|Australian activist Julian Assange—the {{founder of}} WikiLeaks—appeared as himself. Many of his lines {{were written by}} Australian author Kathy Lette, {{who is one of}} Assange's friends. According to Lette, [...] "Julian and The Simpsons {{producers}} asked me to rewrite his scene and dialogue. I guess they just wanted me to add a little Aussie irony to the script. Julian does not suffer from an irony deficiency! I used to write a sitcom for Columbia Pictures, the long-running series The Facts of Life, so the producers knew I could fire off a quip or two." [...] In 2010, Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant to extradite Assange from Britain to Sweden for questioning in relation to sexual assault allegations made against him there. Assange was arrested in England, before being freed on conditional bail until a decision would be made {{as to whether or not}} he should be extradited to Sweden. Assange recorded his lines over the phone while under house arrest in England. Jean, who directed Assange's performance from Los Angeles, only acquired a phone number to call and received no information about the whereabouts of the activist. According to Jean in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening had found out through a rumor that Assange wanted to appear on the show. Casting director Bonnie Pietila was therefore given the task to contact Assange and make sure the guest appearance could happen. The episode features no reference to Assange's legal situation at the time of his recording. Jean commented that he is [...] "a controversial figure, and there's a good reason he's controversial. There was discussion internally whether or not to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the show, but ultimately we went ahead and did it." [...] Groening has said in an interview that [...] "We [...] dare ourselves to do things and Julian Assange was a dare." ...|$|E
500|$|Lost {{was planned}} to be a multi-cultural show with an {{international}} cast. The producers thought it was essential that an Australian was cast for the part of Claire, and the Oceanic 815 was leaving from Sydney. Emilie de Ravin was working in Edmonton, so was unable {{to go to the}} auditions, which were being held in Los Angeles. From a video she sent to the producers, they were able to tell that de Ravin had the youth and sweetness required for the role, but also looked as though she had some life experience. Sayid was not in the original draft of the pilot episode, but executive consultant Jeff Pinkner had worked with Naveen Andrews on a short-lived ABC series called The Beast, and was keen to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> Lost. The producers were surprised that Andrews was interested in the role. When they cast him, all Andrews was told was that Sayid was from Iraq and had been in the army. Yunjin Kim originally auditioned for Kate. At her audition she told the producers that she spoke fluent Korean, having been raised in South Korea, where she had starred in several films. The producers were impressed with Kim's performance and wrote her the character of Sun, who was {{planned to be}} someone who could not speak English, but after examining her relationship with her husband, the audience would learn that she does in fact speak it. Daniel Dae Kim was cast in the role of Jin, Sun's husband. Dae Kim described his audition as a [...] "really interesting experience". He found it especially hard as it was his first time acting in Korean, and he had not spoken in it regularly since being in high school, when he would talk to his parents.|$|E

2500|$|... "Vendaface" [...] – The Vendaface (voiced by Jerry Nelson) is a {{vending machine}} {{that can give}} any Muppet a facelift. The Vendaface was {{apparently}} only meant to be used once, but David Lazer said that they shouldn't build such an expensive puppet only to use him once. The writers then decided to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the show {{a few more times}} in the first series. The Vendaface later appeared in episode 66 as the Vendawish (voiced by Jerry Nelson) which was a wish-granting machine.|$|E
