5|$|Radu Negru's {{personality}} {{is surrounded by}} legend; no details about him can be proved by other historical sources. Some chronicles <b>identify</b> <b>him</b> with the founder of various churches, such as the monastery at Curtea de Argeș, but they mistake him for later voivodes of Wallachia, such as Radu I (c. 1377–c. 1383) and Neagoe Basarab (1512–1521).|$|E
5|$|Altgens recovered, and {{his next}} {{photograph}} showed the First Lady {{with her hand}} on the vehicle's trunk lid and Secret Service agent Clint Hill standing on the bumper behind her as the driver had begun to accelerate. This photograph was quickly reproduced on the front pages of newspapers around the world. Mrs. Kennedy testified the following June that she was aware of the image, but had no memory of her actions. Hill later wrote that this picture would forever <b>identify</b> <b>him</b> as the Secret Service agent {{on the back of the}} limousine.|$|E
5|$|Desperate {{to recover}} the money, Le Chiffre kidnaps Lynd and tortures Bond, {{threatening}} to kill them both {{if he does not}} get the money back. During the torture, a SMERSH assassin enters and kills Le Chiffre as punishment for losing the money. The agent does not kill Bond, saying that he has no orders to do so, but cuts a Cyrillic 'Ш' (sh) to signify the SHpion (Russian for spy) into Bond's hand so that future SMERSH agents will be able to <b>identify</b> <b>him</b> as such.|$|E
50|$|Other identifications {{have been}} put forward which have been {{considered}} fringe theories. In his book Ages in Chaos, Immanuel Velikovsky <b>identified</b> <b>him</b> with Thutmose III. More recently, David Rohl's New Chronology <b>identified</b> <b>him</b> with Ramesses II, and Peter James has <b>identified</b> <b>him</b> with Ramesses III.|$|R

5|$|In late 1261 Breton {{is noted}} as owing £120 {{in the royal}} records. A {{notation}} next to the debt implies {{that he was a}} canon of Hereford Cathedral at this point, but the Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300 does not <b>identify</b> <b>him</b> as such. Breton does not appear in the records from this point until after the Battle of Evesham in 1265, when he is noted as holding a grant of royal safeguarding.|$|E
5|$|Serbia {{started to}} {{disintegrate}} {{after the death}} of Stefan Dušan. According to Matteo Villani, an unidentified Serbian lord sought Hungarian assistance against his more powerful (and also unnamed) enemy in the late 1350s. Historians John V. A. Fine and Pál Engel write that the Serbian lord {{was a member of the}} Rastislalić family; Gyula Kristó and Iván Bertényi <b>identify</b> <b>him</b> as Lazar Hrebeljanović. Royal charters of 1358 show that Hungarian troops fought in Serbia in October 1358. The next summer Louis also marched to Serbia, but Stefan Uroš V of Serbia avoided battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{case against}} Martin falters as {{evidence}} disappears and witnesses fail to <b>identify</b> <b>him</b> in a line-up. Black is approached by Pepper, Martin's self-appointed lawyer, who extends Black {{an invitation to}} join his legal practice. Martin later claims in court to have killed Bletcher. Elsewhere, another Millennium Group member, Mike Atkins (Robin Gammell), receives {{a telephone call from}} someone pretending to be Black. Meanwhile, Black suspects that the occult-oriented murder may have been committed to draw the Group, and Black, into the open again.|$|E
5000|$|Though of priestly descent, {{he was not}} of the Hasmonean family. The Mishnah (Parah 3:5) <b>identifies</b> <b>him</b> as Hanameel the Egyptian, while Josephus ("Ant." [...] xv. 2, § 4) <b>identifies</b> <b>him</b> {{as being}} from Babylon.|$|R

50|$|He was {{a voting}} member (cardinal elector) of the College of Cardinals in the 2005 papal conclave.

Other books and the BBC also <b>identified</b> <b>him</b> as a long-shot possibility for Pope.|$|R
5|$|Tom Pryce's helmet design was, in {{comparison}} to later drivers', simple and restrained. His helmet was plain white all over until 1970. At that year's race at Castle Combe, his father asked Pryce to make his helmet stand out more {{so that he could}} easily <b>identify</b> <b>him</b> in a pack of cars. Pryce added five black vertical lines to his helmet, placed just above his visor. From that time the only change to this design was the addition of a Welsh flag to the side of his helmet in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Tytila (died around 616) was a semi-historical pagan king of East Anglia, a small Anglo-Saxon kingdom {{which today}} {{includes}} the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. Early sources, including Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, <b>identify</b> <b>him</b> {{as an early}} member of the Wuffingas dynasty who succeeded his father Wuffa. A later chronicle dates his reign from 578, {{but he is not}} known to have definitely ruled as king and nothing of his life is known. He is listed in a number of genealogical lists.|$|E
5|$|Wehha was a pagan {{king of the}} East Angles who, if he {{actually}} existed, ruled the kingdom of East Anglia during the 6th century, {{at the time the}} kingdom was being established by migrants from what is now Frisia and the southern Jutland peninsula. Early sources <b>identify</b> <b>him</b> {{as a member of the}} Wuffingas dynasty, which became established around the east coast of Suffolk. Nothing of his reign is known.|$|E

5000|$|On December 21, 2006, he {{appeared}} {{as one of}} the [...] "strangers" [...] on the NBC game show Identity.

5000|$|... 13th - Patrick Buchanan, [...] (Guthrie Smith <b>identifies</b> <b>him</b> as 7th Chief and Buchanan of Auchmar <b>identifies</b> <b>him</b> as 14th Chief) married Jonet Cunningham of Galbraith and by her a son (Walter his successor) and a {{daughter}} (Anabella). He also had an illegitimate son (Patrick).|$|R
5|$|When Rotting {{first came}} out it stirred {{a huge amount of}} {{controversy}} due to its cover art— a traditional grim reaper figure licking what appears to be Jesus Christ's face. It was based upon a medieval painting. The cover artist himself, Kelson Frost, refused to paint a crown of thorns over the man's head, which would readily <b>identify</b> <b>him</b> as the Christian messiah.|$|E
5|$|After {{this sudden}} spate of activity, Smoke Imix {{continued}} to rule until almost {{the end of}} the 7thcentury; he dedicated another nine known monuments and made important changes to the architecture of Copán, including the construction of Structure2, which closes the northern side of the Great Plaza, and a new version of Temple26, nicknamed Chorcha. Smoke Imix ruled Copán for 67years and died on 15June 695 at the age of 79, an age that was so distinguished that it is used to <b>identify</b> <b>him</b> in place of his name on AltarQ. His tomb had already been prepared in the Chorcha phase of Temple26 and he was buried just two days after his death.|$|E
5|$|Blamey became {{involved}} in his first and greatest scandal soon after taking office. During a raid on a brothel in Fitzroy on 21 October 1925, the police encountered a man who produced Blamey's police badge, No. 80. Blamey later {{said that he had}} given his key ring, which included his badge, to a friend who had served with him in France, so that the man could help himself to some alcohol in Blamey's locker at the Naval and Military Club. His story was corroborated by his friend Stanley Savige, who was with him at the time. Blamey protected the man in question, who he said was married with children, and refused to <b>identify</b> <b>him.</b> The man has never been identified, but the description given by the detectives and the brothel owner did not match Blamey.|$|E

5|$|FBI agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) and {{his partner}} of five years, Robert Danzig (Joe Flanigan), are {{pursuing}} an arms dealer; while Lee apprehends the man, his partner is killed by a second, mysterious man with translucent skin and seemingly superhuman abilities. The skin of Danzig's body also becomes translucent after he dies. When forensics comes on the scene, Olivia and Astrid (Jasika Nicole) appear and take the agent's body without revealing their intentions. Lincoln follows Olivia to the lab, where he is introduced to the Fringe division. Despite Olivia attempting to keep Lincoln away, he continues to follow the investigation as they discover another victim killed in a similar manner. From a witness, they learn about {{the appearance of the}} killer, but are unable to <b>identify</b> <b>him</b> by name.|$|E
5|$|In the Synoptics, Jesus and {{his disciples}} {{go to the}} garden Gethsemane, where Jesus prays to be spared his coming ordeal. Then Judas comes with an armed mob, sent by the chief priests, scribes and elders. He kisses Jesus to <b>identify</b> <b>him</b> to the crowd, which then arrests Jesus.

After the third denial, Peter hears the rooster crow and recalls Jesus' {{prediction}} about his denial. Peter then weeps bitterly.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{figures in}} the center of the painting, to the left of Małachowski, include other {{supporters}} of the Constitution. Priest Hugo Kołłątaj (11) is the most prominent, gesturing in disdain at Suchorzewski. Several other {{figures in the}} vicinity are described in sources, but their precise location is unclear, or the sources contradict one another. The priest holding the Bible (12) is probably Feliks Turski, although some <b>identify</b> <b>him</b> as Tymoteusz Gorzeński. The figures to the right of Kołłątaj represents the Grand Lithuanian Marshal, Ignacy Potocki (13), and perhaps Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski (14) (although some sources identify Czartoryski elsewhere in the painting, in the vicinity of Kościuszko). Surrounding Kołłątaj are likely the priest Scipione Piattoli (15) and Tadeusz Matuszewicz or Matusiewicz (16).|$|E

5|$|Tulsidas {{was born}} on saptami, the seventh day of shukla paksha, the bright half of the lunar Hindu {{calendar}} month Shraavana (July–August). Although {{as many as seven}} places are mentioned as his birthplace, most scholars identify the place with Sookar Kshetra Soron, District Kasganj in Uttar Pradesh, a village {{on the banks of the}} river Ganga. In 2012 Sukarkhet Soron was declared officially by the government of Uttar Pradesh as the birthplace of Tulsi Das. His parents were Hulsi and Atmaram Dubey.
