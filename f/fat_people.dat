500|$|Believing Patrick to be sane, Lois authorizes his release, and {{arranges}} for Patrick to {{stay with}} the family. Patrick soon announces he has a wife, Marion, although she is imaginary and nobody else other than him can see her. This leads Brian and Stewie to believe he is crazy. Lois attempts to overlook the evidence, and instead tries to persuade Peter not to encourage people to be fat. Peter unintentionally traumatizes Patrick later by dressing up like Ralph Kramden and repeatedly using one of Kramden's catchphrases [...] "Pow, right in the kisser!" [...] which brings back memories of Gleason telling him to get out. This triggers Patrick to start killing <b>fat</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} of the episode, TV Squad commented {{positively}} about the storyline, noting that [...] "Unlike The Simpsons tonight, Family Guy actually did work their two storylines together.

[...] Basile moves on to comment that [...] "Being prejudiced against <b>fat</b> <b>people</b> just isn't talked about, but this episode sheds a harsh light on that problem.

500|$|Following the character's {{significantly}} expanded role in {{the second}} season, Fink's portrayal has received predominantly positive reviews. Rosie O'Donnell criticized the character, saying that Fink was unattractive and therefore a bad representation of <b>fat</b> <b>people,</b> but later apologized for these remarks. Lauren made her solo musical debut in the second season, performing The Waitresses' [...] "I Know What Boys Like" [...] in the episode [...] "Comeback". The song was well received by critics, and was released as a single, available for download; it was subsequently included on the EP released in September 2011 through the Target chain, Glee: The Music, Dance Party. Although Lauren also appears in ensemble musical performances, Fink is not credited as a vocalist on the series' soundtrack albums. Lauren's role was reduced {{in the beginning of}} the third season, and she made a final, non-speaking appearance in the third episode, [...] "Asian F". After this, it was confirmed she would appear once again in Glee and doing so in the fourth season's episode [...] "Sadie Hawkins", which premiered on 24 January 2013. After this, she made numerous appearances in flashbacks before appearing one final time in the series finale, [...] "Dreams Come True", during the performance of OneRepublic's [...] "I Lived" [...] by the glee club's alumni.|$|E
500|$|... "Sweets and Sour Marge" [...] {{was written}} by Carolyn Omine and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January20,2002. The idea for the episode was pitched by Omine, who based it on a lawsuit at the time, wherein smokers sued tobacco companies for selling harmful wares. Omine found it [...] "kinda weird" [...] that the people did not {{take responsibility for their}} own health, and joked that, in the future, people might sue food companies for [...] "making them fat", which eventually became the episode's plot. While making the episode, the Simpsons writers decided to compile a list of Springfield's fat residents. According to Omine, the list [...] "never ended", and when the writers realized the amount of <b>fat</b> <b>people</b> there were in Springfield, they decided that the residents should try and [...] "go for the world record" [...] in the [...] "fattest people" [...] category. The writers then decided that the residents were trying to set the world record for largest human pyramid, and then accidentally set the record for fattest population. The episode features the first appearance of Cletus' cousin Dia-Betty. The character was animated by Kirkland's assistant Matt Faughnan, who has since become a regular director for the series. Garth Motherloving, the head of the [...] "Motherloving Sweets and Sugar Company", was portrayed by American actor and comedian Ben Stiller.|$|E

Critser also describes specific health risks linked to obesity and a fast food-rich diet. The book covers some of the same subject matter as Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation (2001), but expands on the health costs of obesity to children and adults.|$|R

This article analyzes medical discourses of obesity and sex in order to argue that fat sex is constructed as a type of failure. Using insights from antisocial queer theory, fat sex is further shown to be queer in its failure to adhere to the specifically heteronormative dictates of what Edelman (2004) calls ‘reproductive futurism’. The analysis finally engages with Halberstam’s (2011) notion of queer failure to demonstrate how deconstructing notions of success and failure might offer fat political projects new ways to imagine the future of fat sex...|$|R
50|$|The Mediterranean Diet is one heavily {{influenced}} by monounsaturated <b>fats.</b> <b>People</b> in Mediterranean countries consume more total fat than Northern European countries, {{but most of the}} fat {{is in the form of}} monounsaturated fatty acids from olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids from fish, vegetables, and certain meats like lamb, while consumption of saturated fat is minimal in comparison. The diet in Crete is fairly high in total fat (40% of total calories, almost exclusively provided by olive oil) yet affords a remarkable protection from coronary heart disease (and probably colon cancer), but unlikely from breast cancer due to a very high oleic acid content.|$|R

40|$|Obesity is {{a complex}} health issue that is {{influenced}} by many different factors. The US Department of Health and Human Services (2001) defines obesity as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or more. Body Mass Index is calculated by dividing weight (kilograms) by height (in metres squared). The Body Mass Index can overestimate <b>fat</b> in <b>people</b> who are very muscular, and it can underestimate <b>fat</b> in <b>people</b> who have lost muscle (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2001). Sorenson (2000) described obesity as a global phenomenon that is rapidly increasing in many populations, and which has threatening implications for public health because of the associated increased risk of Type II diabetes and its cardiovascular complications. In 1999, 61 % of adults in the USA were estimated to be either overweight o...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{presents}} “fattening austerity” {{as a new}} {{conceptual framework}} that will enable a collective resistance to austerity politics and fat oppression. Austerity and fatphobia have not, to our knowledge, been analyzed in tandem. But the discourses that uphold both punitive austerity measures and the pathologization of <b>fat</b> <b>people’s</b> bodies are deeply imbricated. Austerity and anti-fat stigma each invoke a language of crisis to authorize social practices that inflict hunger and bodily injury upon <b>people</b> who are <b>fat</b> and/or poor. In addition, anti-‘obesity’ rhetoric and pro-austerity arguments each utilize the neoliberal values of “personal responsibility” and corporeal “choice” to further marginalize people who are poor, fat, or both. We {{argue that it is}} incumbent upon the political Left—which thus far has been remiss in challenging the anti-fat prejudice that often animates its own movements—to make fat justice a central part of its critique of austerity...|$|R
