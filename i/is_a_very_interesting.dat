5|$|I am very honoured {{to unveil}} this blue plaque and thank English Heritage for honouring John in this way. This {{particular}} flat has many memories {{for me and}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> part of our history. In {{what would have been}} John's 70th year, I am grateful to you all for commemorating John and this particular part of his London life, one which spawned so much of his great music and great art.|$|E
5|$|Passing {{from these}} {{historic}} examples {{we find the}} chair monopolized by the ruler, lay or ecclesiastical, to a comparatively late date. As the seat of authority it stood {{at the head of}} the lord’s table, on his dais, by the side of his bed. The seigneurial chair, more common in France and the Netherlands than in England, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> type, approximating in many respects to the episcopal or abbatial throne or stall. It early acquired a very high back and sometimes had a canopy. Arms were invariable, and the lower part was closed in with panelled or carved front and sides—the seat, indeed, was often hinged and sometimes closed with a key.|$|E
25|$|The latter one <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> situation, in that ROC civilians tend {{to shake}} down the related {{military}} units when {{such kind of}} accidents occur. For some paranoid thinking, people in the ROC military presume that the local policemen would side with civilians. As an unofficial rule in all ROC armed forces, all military drivers, and commissioned or non-commissioned officers are frequently instructed to call in the military police when they find themselves {{are in the middle}} of such a vehicular incident.|$|E

500|$|I {{remember}} once {{going to}} see him when he was ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavorable omen. [...] "No", he replied, [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways." ...|$|E
500|$|Within {{the above}} {{framework}} physicists were then able to calculate {{to a high}} degree of accuracy some of the properties of electrons, such as the anomalous magnetic dipole moment. However, as Feynman points out, it fails totally to explain why particles such as the electron have the masses they do. [...] "There is no theory that adequately explains these numbers. We use the numbers in all our theories, but we don't understand them – what they are, or where they come from. I believe that from a fundamental point of view, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> and serious problem." ...|$|E

On her character and work with Beagan, Leoni said: [...] "Agent Denham is your standard-issue, ball-breaking FBI agent. She's certainly a very tough lady, and it's not my first waltz {{with this type of}} character. However, I was able {{to spend some time with}} Anne, a great technical advisor we had on set. She's got this steely gaze that is terrifying, but what's underneath that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> lady. Beyond the technical aspects of the job, she provided so much more for me to use." ...|$|E

500|$|Most of Gould's {{empirical}} research pertained to land snails. He focused his early {{work on the}} Bermudian genus Poecilozonites, while his later work concentrated on the West Indian genus Cerion. According to Gould [...] "Cerion is the land snail of maximal diversity in form throughout the entire world. There are 600 described species of this single genus. In fact, they're not really species, they all interbreed, but the names exist to express a real phenomenon which is this incredible morphological diversity. Some are shaped like golf balls, some are shaped like pencils. ... Now my main subject is the evolution of form, {{and the problem of}} how it is that you can get this diversity amid so little genetic difference, so far as we can tell, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> one. And if we could solve this we'd learn something general about the evolution of form." ...|$|E
500|$|Inspired by the film, baroque {{pop singer}} Lana Del Rey {{recorded}} a cover version of Bobby Vinton's classic {{rendition of the}} song [...] "Blue Velvet" [...] in 2012. Used to endorse clothing line H, a music video accompanied the track and aired as a television commercial. Filmed in Post-war Americana, the video drew influence from Lynch and Blue Velvet. In the video, Del Rey {{plays the role of}} Dorothy Vallens, performing a private concert similar to the scene where Ben (Dean Stockwell) pantomimes [...] "In Dreams" [...] for Frank Booth. Del Rey's version, however, has her lip-syncing [...] "Blue Velvet" [...] when a little person dressed as Frank Sinatra approaches and unplugs a hidden Victrola, revealing Del Rey as a fraud. When Lynch heard of the music video, he praised it, telling Artinfo: [...] "Lana Del Rey, she's got some fantastic charisma and—this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> thing—it's like she's born out of another time. She's got something that's very appealing to people. And I didn't know she was influenced by me!" ...|$|E

Etim in an interview with Leadership Newspaper stated: [...] "I am not exactly a rookie {{when it comes to the}} Igbo Language but until Phone Swap, I never needed to speak Igbo as a native would. I will admit that it was quite challenging, because I had to learn a specific dialect.

2500|$|There is a Mass in Bodl. MS. 572 (at Oxford), {{in honour of}} St Germanus, {{which appears}} to be Cornish and relates to [...] "Ecclesia Lanaledensis", which has been {{considered}} to be the monastery of St. Germanus, in Cornwall. There is no other evidence of the name, which was also the Breton name of Aleth, now part of Saint-Malo. The manuscript, which contains also certain glosses, possibly Cornish or Breton—it would be impossible to distinguish between them at that date—but held by Professor Loth to be Welsh, is probably of the 9th century, and the Mass is quite Roman in type, being probably written after that part of Cornwall had come under Saxon influence. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> Proper Preface.|$|E
2500|$|The early Heinlein biographer {{and critic}} Alexei Panshin, in his 1968 {{biography}} Heinlein in Dimension, {{took note of}} a controversial theme: [...] "The romantic situation in this story <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting,</b> very odd one: it {{is nothing less than}} a mutual sexual interest between an engineer of thirty and a girl of twelve ('adorable' is Heinlein's word for her), that culminates in marriage after some hop-scotching around in time to adjust their ages a bit." [...] The novel [...] "worried and bothered" [...] John W. Campbell, who said [...] "Bob can write a better story, with one hand tied behind him, than most people in the field can do with both hands. But Jesus, I wish that son of a gun would take that other hand out of his pocket." ...|$|E

2500|$|The lowest-level {{concepts}} {{related to}} visual perception {{for a human}} being probably differ little from the concepts of a frog. In any case, {{the structure of the}} retina in mammals and in human beings is the same as in amphibians. The phenomenon of distortion of perception of an image stabilized on the retina gives some idea of the concepts of the subsequent levels of the hierarchy. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> phenomenon. When a person looks at an immobile object, [...] "fixes" [...] it with his eyes, the eyeballs do not remain absolutely immobile; they make small involuntary movements. As a result the image of the object on the retina is constantly in motion, slowly drifting and jumping back to the point of maximum sensitivity. The image [...] "marks time" [...] in the vicinity of this point.|$|E
2500|$|... "Sullivan ... {{was very}} much in touch with all the music of his time.... There are bits which are {{definitely}} Wagnerian: the use of dotted rhythms, always in 4/4 time – you get the whiff of Meistersinger or Lohengrin, I think. There is, also, for example, a remarkable duet at the end of act 2, I would say Verdian in its sweep. [...] There are, of course, the stand-up arias, never a full ensemble until right at the end. [...] Rebecca's aria <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> piece. [...] Whenever she is singing he uses the cor anglais to stress the sort of Eastern quality, and Sullivan claimed that this theme was one he had heard as a student in Leipzig, when he had attended a service at the Synagogue there. You can tell, and he quickly establishes it in the music, that he was not writing an operetta! [...] Look at this, very early on, some virtuoso stuff. [...] It needs a really accomplished orchestra. [...] He had always been cramped by the small orchestra, only ever one oboe, that he had to make do with at the Savoy. [...] Here he was really able to expand, you can feel it in the music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blache was {{introduced}} to the idea of painting Leah Chase by his art representative at the time Eugene C. Daymude in the summer of 2009. The 20 small oil paintings that comprised the series detailed the day-to-day activities 92-year-old Chef Leah Chase encounters from early morning prep work to greeting guests in the dining room. [...] Blache was heralded for his depiction of the culinary icon for his accuracy and delicate handling of paint, color, and texture. [...] “Asked whether she thought the rendering was accurate, Chase, 89, said the young artist had gotten it right. [...] “I told him, ‘You could have made me look like Halle Berry or Lena Horne, but you made it look like me,’” she said. [...] The painting Cutting Squash was acquired for its permanent collection by the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in 2011. [...] “We are always looking for portraits of nationally prominent figures,” National Portrait Gallery chief curator Brandon Fortune said. [...] “It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> image of a woman at work, doing a very simple task, cutting squash,” [...] [...] [...] “But in some ways it transcends the everyday and becomes something of national significance.” [...] This series reinforces Blache's commitment to documenting everyday labor and showcasing these intimate processes to the public. [...] Another one of the Smithsonian Institution Museums, National Museum of African History and Culture, came calling for another painting of Chase from the Blache series in 2013 and acquired Leah Red Coat Stirring (Sketch) in 2013, making it the third painting from Blache {{to be included in the}} permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
