40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} dynamic tensile and compressive {{properties of}} AT 72 magnesium alloys under high strain rates, the Split Hopkinson tensile Bar (SHTB) and the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar apparatus was used at ambient temperature. The specimens after dynamic tension and dynamic compression {{were analyzed by}} scanning electron microscope (SEM) and metallographic microscope. Dynamic mechanical properties and fracture mechanism were discussed in this paper. The results show that at approximate tensile strain rate, the dynamic tensile strength of ordinary <b>die-casting</b> AT 72 and vacuum <b>die-casting</b> AT 72 is very similar, but the dynamic failure strain is of great difference. AT 72 magnesium alloys under dynamic compressive yield continuously, and have the slight positive strain rate effect. The dynamic compressive behaviors of ordinary <b>die-casting</b> AT 72 and vacuum <b>die-casting</b> AT 72 are nearly the same. The dynamic tensile fracture mechanism of both vacuum <b>die-casting</b> AT 72 and ordinary <b>die-casting</b> AT 72 is inter-granular fracture. The dynamic compressive fracture mechanism of both vacuum <b>die-casting</b> AT 72 and ordinary <b>die-casting</b> AT 72 is quasi-cleavage intra-crystalline failure. The pores have an important effect on dynamic properties of die casting magnesium alloys...|$|R

25|$|Cast threads {{in metal}} parts may be {{finished}} by machining, {{or may be}} left in the as-cast state. (The same can be said of cast gear teeth.) Whether or not to bother with the additional expense of a machining operation depends on the application. For parts where the extra precision and surface finish is not strictly necessary, the machining is forgone in order to achieve a lower cost. With sand casting parts this means a rather rough finish; but with molded plastic or <b>die-cast</b> metal, the threads can be very nice indeed straight from the mold or die. A common example of molded plastic threads is on soda (pop) bottles. A common example of <b>die-cast</b> threads is on cable glands (connectors/fittings).|$|E
