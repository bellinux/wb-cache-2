5|$|The {{content of}} water or other solvent {{molecules}} changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into micelles or vesicles. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>surface)</b> that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.|$|E

Water establishes a concentration gradient around the protein, {{with the highest}} concentration at the protein surface. This water network has a damping effect on the attractive forces between proteins.|$|E

50|$|Surface {{coatings}} {{will occur}} via two theoretical mechanisms, the first being direct hydrophobic {{interaction of the}} lipid tail with a hydrophobic surface resulting in a monolayer of FSL at the surface (Fig. 5b). Hydrophobic binding of the FSL will be via its hydrophobic lipid tail interacting directly with the hydrophobic (lipophilic) surface. The second surface coating will be through the formation of bilayers as the lipid tail is unable to react with the <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>surface.</b> In this case the lipids will induce {{the formation of a}} bilayer, the surface of which will be hydrophilic. This hydrophilic membrane will then interact directly with the <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>surface</b> and will probably encapsulate fibres. This hydrophilic bilayer binding is the expected mechanism by which FSLs are able to bind to fibrous membranes such as paper and glass fibres (Fig. 5c) and (Fig. 9).|$|E

Fluorescently labeled fungal cells were used to quantify the kinetics of adhesion of these cell types to surfaces having various hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties. Aerial conidia adhered poorly to weakly polar surfaces and rapidly to both hydrophobic and <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>surfaces</b> but could be readily washed off the latter surfaces. In contrast, blastospores bound poorly to hydrophobic surfaces, forming small aggregates, bound rapidly to <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and required a longer incubation time to bind to weakly polar <b>surfaces</b> than to <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Submerged conidia displayed the broadest binding specificity, adhering to hydrophobic, weakly polar, and <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The adhesion of the B. bassiana cell types also differed in sensitivity to glycosidase and protease treatments, pH, and addition of various carbohydrate competitors and detergents. The outer cell wall layer of aerial conidia contained sodium dodecyl sulfate-insoluble, trifluoro-acetic acid-soluble proteins (presumably hydrophobins) that were not present on either blastospores or submerged conidia.

Hydrophobic surfaces can be easily hydrophilized by the adsorption of nonionic surfactants or block copolymers containing hydrophobic chain segments; the cooperative interaction between the hydrocarbon moieties contributes more to the free energy of adsorption than the interaction with the hydro- phobic <b>surface.</b> <b>Hydrophilic</b> layers are also readily formed on <b>hydrophilic</b> <b>surfaces</b> provided specific interaction between the hydrophilic end groups and the surface creates a sufficiently hydrophobic surface so that a second layer can be formed through cooperative interaction.
