5|$|Queen Mary 2 {{is not a}} {{steamship}} {{like many}} of her predecessors, but is powered primarily by four diesel engines, with two additional gas turbines used when extra power is required; this integrated <b>electric</b> <b>propulsion</b> configuration is used to produce the power to drive her four <b>electric</b> <b>propulsion</b> pods as well as powering the ship's hotel services. The spaces for these prime movers are also split, and controls are also backed up, {{with the intention of}} preventing a single failure from disabling the ship.|$|E
5|$|An {{aftermarket}} {{electric vehicle}} conversion is the modification {{of a conventional}} internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) or hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) to <b>electric</b> <b>propulsion,</b> creating an all-electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The Mitsubishi <b>Electric</b> <b>propulsion</b> {{system was}} retained, having {{performed}} better than expected. The wheelchair space was made {{available on the}} end of two mid-train cars, nearest to the lifts in above-ground stations. LED displays that blink to warn passengers of closing doors were introduced in the upper middle section of the door. Additional loudspeakers and advertisement panels were also introduced. Hand grips were moved to the support bars of the seats on the ceiling and grabpoles were located near the doors and at both ends of each carriage. The air-conditioning system was modified to match the system used in the C751B cars, with air-conditioning vents and in-flow fans installed.|$|E

5|$|To finance {{electrification}} at {{the beginning}} of the 20th century, American financier Charles Yerkes took it over and made it part of his Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) group. <b>Electric</b> <b>propulsion</b> was introduced in 1905, and by the end of the year electric multiple units operated all of the services. On 1 July 1933, the District Railway and the other UERL railways were merged with the Metropolitan Railway and the capital's tramway and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board.|$|E
5|$|In response, SMRT {{announced}} it was replacing important engineering components on all C151 trains by 2019. This included changing the existing Mitsubishi <b>Electric</b> <b>propulsion</b> system for the newer Insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) propulsion system by Toshiba, technology currently used in the Tokyo Metro's 1000 series and 16000 series trains {{as well as the}} Kyushu 305 series and Hankyu 1000 series trains. As of July 2015, train sets 055/056 and 131/132 are trialed with the new propulsion system. In tandem with the replacement of the signalling system on the East-West Line and North-South Line with the newer Thales SelTrac signalling system, new equipment are installed in the passenger compartment of the trailer cars.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rolling}} stock and Mitsubishi <b>Electric</b> <b>propulsion</b> {{equipment}} were constructed in Japan, many parts were sourced from Europe. The trains were fitted with Stone Platt air-conditioning, Duwag bogies, Sig gangways, Scharfenberg couplers and Westinghouse brakes. Mitsubishi Electric's propulsion equipment was estimated to consume 50% less electricity than Hong Kong's existing MTR M-Train EMU. Its Automatic Train Control (ATC) signalling system was supplied by Westinghouse, capable of running at pre-programmed speeds and activated by the train driver. While theoretically possible to design for a fully driverless operation using this signalling technology, MRT Corporation (MRTC, now SMRT Corporation) decided against this option. The trainsets were assembled in Kobe, Japan, and then shipped to Singapore by Neptune Orient Lines. The first trainset was delivered to MRTC on 8 July 1986 at Bishan Depot, officiated by Yeo Ning Hong.|$|E

50|$|Talisman had a {{passenger}} capacity of over 1250. Large deckhouses {{fore and aft}} and a single tall funnel amidships gave her an unusual appearance for a Clyde Steamer. During the refit on returning to civilian service, new deckhouses were added, providing additional shelter. Her four British Polar diesel engines powered the vessel's electricity generators that provided the power to the <b>electric</b> <b>propulsions</b> motors. Decca radar was fitted in late 1958.|$|R
5|$|Another key design {{decision}} {{was to develop}} the concept car based on a new family of common powertrain components for <b>electric</b> <b>propulsion,</b> which initially was called the E-Flex Systems, “E” stands for electric drive and “Flex” for the different sources of electricity, but later was renamed Voltec drive system. The E-Flex or Voltec powertrain {{is an attempt to}} standardize many components of possible future electrically propelled vehicles, and to allow multiple interchangeable electricity-generating systems. The E-Flex powertrain has the potential to adapt the vehicles to pure battery electric, to fuel cell-powered or to several other sources of energy to create electricity on board, such as engine-generator sets (genset) fueled by gasoline, diesel, biodiesel, ethanol fuel (E100), or flex-fuel (E85). Regenerative braking would also contribute to the on-board electricity generation. In October 2006 the E-flex powertrain was selected for the new propulsion architecture and the name Volt was chosen by General Motors.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a {{proposal}} for an asteroid mission was submitted to the European Space Agency (ESA). Named the Asteroidal Gravity Optical and Radar Analysis (AGORA), this spacecraft was to launch some time in 1990–1994 and perform two flybys of large asteroids. The preferred target for this mission was Vesta. AGORA would reach the asteroid belt either by a gravitational slingshot trajectory past Mars or {{by means of a}} small ion engine. However, the proposal was refused by the ESA. A joint NASA–ESA asteroid mission was then drawn up for a Multiple Asteroid Orbiter with Solar <b>Electric</b> <b>Propulsion</b> (MAOSEP), with one of the mission profiles including an orbit of Vesta. NASA indicated they were not interested in an asteroid mission. Instead, the ESA set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive. Other missions to the asteroid belt were proposed in the 1980s by France, Germany, Italy and the United States, but none were approved. Exploration of Vesta by fly-by and impacting penetrator was the second main target of the first plan of the multi-aimed Soviet Vesta mission, developed in cooperation with European countries for realisation in 1991–1994 but canceled due to the Soviet Union disbanding.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigate}} the {{gravity gradient stabilization}} mode of the Earth artificial satellite designed for microgravity studies. The satellite dimensions and inertia tensor {{are similar to the}} same characteristics of the spacecraft Foton and Progress. We consider two variants of the mode - the passive (uncontrollable) variant and the active (controllable) one. <b>Electric</b> <b>propulsions</b> are used for control of satellite attitude motion in the active variant. We check two conditions for both variants: the low level of residual accelerations on board the satellite and the stability of the motion (preservation of its basic properties {{over a long period of}} time, insensibility to errors in initial conditions). Checking is caring out by mathematical modeling of the satellite attitude motion. We demonstrate that the active variant provides the low level of accelerations but is not stable relative to errors in initial conditions of the motion. The active variant satisfies two conditions above. Interchange of these variants proves to be more economical: the <b>electric</b> <b>propulsions</b> operate only a few hours every 3 - 5 days to damp arising disturbed motion.

25|$|All current {{spacecraft}} use chemical rockets (bipropellant or solid-fuel) for launch, {{though some}} (such as the Pegasus rocket and SpaceShipOne) have used air-breathing engines {{on their first}} stage. Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters (often monopropellant rockets) or resistojet rockets for orbital station-keeping and some use momentum wheels for attitude control. Soviet bloc satellites have used <b>electric</b> <b>propulsion</b> for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north-south stationkeeping and orbit raising.
