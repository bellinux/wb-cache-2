25|$|OBD-II is an {{improvement}} over OBD-I in both capability and standardization. The OBD-II standard specifies the type of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>connector</b> and its pinout, the electrical signalling protocols available, and the messaging format. It also provides a candidate list of vehicle parameters to monitor along with how to encode the data for each. There is a pin in the connector that provides power for the scan tool from the vehicle battery, which eliminates the need to connect a scan tool to a power source separately. However, some technicians might still connect the scan tool to an auxiliary power source to protect data in the unusual event that a vehicle experiences a {{loss of electrical power}} due to a malfunction. Finally, the OBD-II standard provides list of standardized DTCs. As a result of this standardization, a single device can query the on-board computer(s) for these parameters in any vehicle. OBD-II standardization was prompted to simplify diagnosis of increasingly complicated emissions equipment, and though only emission-related codes and data are required to be transmitted through it according to U.S. legislation, most manufacturers have made the OBD-II Data Link Connector the main connector in the vehicle through which all systems are diagnosed and reprogrammed. OBD-II Diagnostic Trouble Codes are 4-digit, preceded by a letter: P for engine and transmission (powertrain), B for body, C for chassis, and U for network. Manufacturers may also add custom data parameters to their specific OBD-II implementation, including real-time data requests as well as trouble codes.|$|E

The J1587 protocol uses different <b>diagnostic</b> <b>connectors.</b> Up to 1995, individual OEMs used their own connectors. From 1996 to 2001, the 6-pin Deutsch-connector was standard. Beginning in 2001, most OEMs converted to the 9-pin Deutsch. Some OEMs still use the 6-pin Deutsch. It has mostly been used for US made vehicles, and also by Volvo. Other European brands have usually used KWP.|$|R
2500|$|The {{regulatory}} {{intent of}} OBD-I was to encourage auto manufacturers to design reliable {{emission control systems}} that remain effective for the vehicle's [...] "useful life". The Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) of OBD-I vehicles can usually be found without an expensive 'scan tool'. Each manufacturer used their own diagnostic link connector (DLC), DLC location, DTC definitions, and procedure to read the DTCs from the vehicle. DTCs from OBD-I cars are often read through the blinking patterns of the 'Check Engine Light' (CEL) or 'Service Engine Soon' (SES) light. By connecting certain pins of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>connector,</b> the 'Check Engine' light will blink out a two-digit number that corresponds to a specific error condition. The DTCs of some OBD-I cars are interpreted in different ways, however. Cadillac (gasoline) fuel-injected vehicles are equipped with actual on-board diagnostics, providing trouble codes, actuator tests and sensor data through the new digital Electronic Climate Control display. Holding down 'Off' and 'Warmer' for several seconds activates the diagnostic mode {{without the need for}} an external scan tool. Some Honda engine computers are equipped with LEDs that light up in a specific pattern to indicate the DTC. General Motors, some 1989–1995 Ford vehicles (DCL), and some 1989–1995 Toyota/Lexus vehicles have a live sensor data stream available, however, many other OBD-I equipped vehicles do not. OBD-I vehicles have fewer DTCs available than for OBD-II equipped vehicles.|$|E

25|$|The ADR 79/01 vehicle {{standard}} (Australian Design Rule 79/01 – Emission Control for Light Vehicles, 2005) is the Australian {{equivalent of}} OBD-II. It {{applies to all}} vehicles of category M1 and N1 with a gross Vehicle Weight rating of 3500kg or less, registered from new within Australia and produced since January 1, 2006 for petrol (gasoline) engined cars and since January 1, 2007 for diesel engined cars. For newly introduced models, the regulation dates applied a year earlier – January 1, 2005 for petrol and January 1, 2006 for diesel. The ADR 79/01 standard was supplemented by the ADR 79/02 standard which imposed tighter emissions restrictions, applicable to all vehicles of class M1 and N1 with a {{gross vehicle weight rating}} of 3500kg or less, from July 1, 2008 for new models, July 1, 2010 for all models.

30|$|White et al. (2007) {{presented}} experimental investigations on representative carbon-epoxy composite {{scarf and}} over-ply joints. Piezoelectric elements {{were used to}} excite and measure {{the response of the}} repaired structure. The frequency response signature of the repaired structure with simulated debondings was found to differ significantly from that one with undamaged repair, considering two sets of boundary conditions. Soejima et al. (2008) developed a novel damage monitoring system, which can monitor the integrity of composite structures in aircrafts. In that system, FBG sensors were used as sensors, and piezoelectric transducers (PZT) were used as the generators of elastic waves, which propagated in the structure to be inspected. Damages such as debonding and delamination were introduced in the bonded sections of the skin and stringers by impact loadings. Zagrai et al. (2008) proposed a structural health monitoring (SHM) approach based on nonlinear ultrasonic response for rapid <b>diagnostics</b> of structural <b>connectors</b> and joints. Experimental studies showed variation in the nonlinear response of the joints due to the applied loadings.|$|R
40|$|Syftet med detta examensarbete var att skapa ett serverprogram i en enkortsdator som arbetar i realtid för att kunna hjälpa människor att köra mer ekonomiskt och miljövänligt i deras vardag. Detta var ett av målen ställda av produktbeställaren Ziggy Creative Colony. Ett mer långsiktigt mål från beställaren är att datorn skall installeras i en bil och kopplas till bilens {{on-board}} diagnostic-II (OBD-II) -uttag. Datorn ska sedan, via OBD-II, kunna samla information som till exempel hastighet, acceleration och bränsleflöde från bilens {{engine control}} unit (ECU). Serverprogrammet ska bearbeta denna information som sedan kommuniceras och visualiseras till bilföraren via en native mobilapplikation. Serverprogrammet byggdes i en linuxbaserad dator: Raspberry Pi och döptes av oss till Car-Pi. Car-Pi designades enligt arkitekturmönstret Model-View-Controller (MVC) som gör det lätt att underhålla, vidare-utveckla och implementera programmet av produktägaren, Ziggy Creative Colony, i framtiden. I och med denna rapport levererar vi programmet Car-Pi tillsammans med ett arkitektdokument och en prototyp till en Android mobilapplikation för att kunna testa Car-Pi och se hur det fungerar i verkligheten. The purpose of this bachelor degree project {{was to create a}} server program in a single-board computer that will function in real time in order to help people drive more economically and eco-friendly. This was one of the goals set by the project owner, Ziggy Creative Colony. Another more long-term goal from Ziggy Creative Colony is that the computer should be installed in a car and connected to the car’s on-board <b>diagnostics</b> (OBD-II) <b>connector.</b> The computer should, via the OBD-II connection, be able to collect information such as speed, acceler-ation and fuel flow from the car’s {{engine control unit}} (ECU). The server program will then process this information that will later be communi-cated and visualized to the car driver via an Android mobile applica-tion. The server program was built in a linux-based computer: Raspberry Pi and named Car-Pi. Car-Pi was designed according to the well-known architectural pattern Model-View-Controller (MVC), which makes it easy to maintain, develop and implement the program by the project owner Ziggy Creative Colony in the future. With this report we are delivering the program Car-Pi together with an architectural document and an Android mobile application-prototype to show how Car-Pi functions in real life...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOn-road {{measurement}} of vehicle tailpipe emissions, analyzing {{the data and}} developing a model, {{is very important to}} identify and recommend improved design and management approaches for the transport sector. A light-duty vehicle, the flex-fuel Nissan Versa equipped with a 1. 6 liter engine and manual transmission was monitored in real operation. The on-board monitoring equipment consisted of a five-gas analyzer for CO, HC(CH 4), NOx, CO 2 and SO 2 in addition to dry systems, with sample lines directly connected to the tailpipe, and an on-board <b>diagnostics</b> (OBD II) <b>connector,</b> GPS, including other additional parameters monitoring (i. e. data logger with embedded microcontrollers). The operating parameters registered in this vehicle were: vehicle speed, engine speed, fuel consumption, angle position of the throttle valve, cooling water, oil and exhaust gas temperatures. The measurements were performed using gasoline with 27 %, and 100 % ethanol blends (E 27 and E 100 respectively, where E 27 is used in emission certification). The vehicle-experiment (driving pattern) was realized in an urban route in the Fortaleza City, Brazil, under typical traffic conditions. The analysis indicates that the average emission rates (kg/h) for CO are more than a factor of 10 higher to NO idling emissions. AVL CRUISE integrated with AVL BOOST software were used to model the vehicle and the flex-fuel engine engine in both certification driving cycles and real operation ones. Real operation data is used to validate the model...|$|R
40|$|The initial {{focus of}} TEDANN is on AGT- 1500 fuel flow dynamics: that is, fuel flow faults {{detectable}} in the {{signals from the}} Electronic Control Unit`s (ECU) <b>diagnostic</b> <b>connector.</b> These voltage signals represent {{the status of the}} Electro-Mechanical Fuel System (EMFS) in response to ECU commands. The EMFS is a fuel metering device that delivers fuel to the turbine engine under the management of the ECU. The ECU is an analog computer whose fuel flow algorithm is dependent upon throttle position, ambient air and turbine inlet temperatures, and compressor and turbine speeds. Each of these variables has a representative voltage signal available at the ECU`s J 1 <b>diagnostic</b> <b>connector,</b> which is accessed via the Automatic Breakout Box (ABOB). The ABOB is a firmware program capable of converting 128 separate analog data signals into digital format. The ECU`s J 1 <b>diagnostic</b> <b>connector</b> provides 32 analog signals to the ABOB. The ABOB contains a 128 to 1 multiplexer and an analog-to-digital converter, CP both operated by an 8 -bit embedded controller. The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) developed and published the hardware specifications as well as the micro-code for the ABOB Intel EPROM processor and the internal code for the multiplexer driver subroutine. Once the ECU analog readings are converted into a digital format, the data stream will be input directly into TEDANN via the serial RS- 232 port of the Contact Test Set (CTS) computer. The CTS computer is an IBM compatible personal computer designed and constructed for tactical use on the battlefield. The CTS has a 50 MHz 32 -bit Intel 80486 DX processor. It has a 200 MB hard drive and 8 MB RAM. The CTS also has serial, parallel and SCSI interface ports. The CTS will also host a frame-based expert system for diagnosing turbine engine faults (referred to as TED; not shown in Figure 1) ...|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{impact of}} the motor vehicle has been felt in every stage {{of the motor vehicle}} operation. In the initial phase of the operation, when the vehicle is new, the amount of {{pollutants}} getting into the environment is less than {{at the end of its}} life, before the scrapping. This is connected with wearing the engine during its operation. However, the need for better performance through the chiptuning or the Box type devices are quite common nowadays, but the impact on the environment may not exceed the permitted emission limits. The article describes the external, so-called Box, module and its impact on the change of the injector opening time, and also on the change of the ROVER 2. 0 CDTi engine power and torque. The simplicity of this device lies in the fact that such a modification can be made by everyone who follows the installation instructions. It is not necessary to conduct the program reading, like in the case of a program exchange in the EEPROM or programming via the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>connector</b> EOBD. The external module (box) is connected between the ECU and the Common Rail injectors. Thus, the control program does not change, but the injector opening time is adequately increased...|$|E
40|$|Smartphones {{could replace}} {{dedicated}} hardware for {{the deployment of}} on-board units in vehicles? Today smartphones and Electronic Control Units (ECU's) have comparable processing power, and smartphone's users are steadily increasing in number, making this kind of device a prime choice for any vehicular application. The real difference between them {{is the amount of}} data coming from the vehicle's ECU's which is available to the latter one. However, some information can be also collected by the smartphone, simply interfacing it to the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>connector</b> named OBD, available on all cars, via a Bluetooth adapter. In the future, possibly in the next few years, more data could be provided through vehicle's Bluetooth, making this approach even more attractive. Another point in favour of this solution is the steady increase in processing and connectivity capabilities of smartphones, so that even old vehicles {{will be able to use}} state-of-the-art ITS applications. This can not be done with an ECU, which cannot be easily replaced or upgraded during the vehicle life. All this makes quite interesting to investigate the potential of what we named a "connected vehicle", i. e. a vehicle where a smartphone is able to retrieve some data from the OBD-II diagnostic interface (or directly from the Bluetooth vehicle's information system in a possible future scenario) and plays a key role in providing services to their users in many different Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) scenario...|$|E
