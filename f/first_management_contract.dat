According to NWC CEO Loay Al-Musallam the Joint Ventures can be profitable despite low water tariffs through the sale of treated effluent, because bulk water and capital investments are provided for free.|$|E

50|$|The {{reform process}} was {{initiated}} in 2000 {{shortly after the}} <b>first</b> <b>management</b> <b>contract</b> covering the capital Yerevan was signed. As a first step, water tariffs were increased. Then the utility in charge of Yerevan, and which was assisted by the private company under the management contract, was transformed from a government department subject to civil service rules to a publicly owned commercially oriented joint stock company. In 2002 a new Water Code was passed {{as the centerpiece of}} the reform process. A powerful State Committee for Water Economy (SCWE) was created as the main decision-making body for sector policies, except for tariff reviews. The next year an autonomous regulatory agency, the Public Services Regulatory Commission, was set up to review requests for tariff adjustments on the basis of objective criteria. These reforms were an important element in securing the benefits achieved in the sector. The first two years of the management contract in Yerevan prior to the reforms had been challenging, characterized by suspicion and even hostility {{between the government and the}} private company. After the reforms were implemented, the situation improved.|$|E
40|$|<b>Management</b> <b>contracts</b> {{appeared}} {{as a form of}} an enterprise management when the era of market economy had dawned. The issues of <b>management</b> <b>contracts</b> are complex and multidimensional because they include economic, social, and legal aspects. The discussion below concerns selected legal aspects of <b>management</b> <b>contracts</b> which remain at the focus of the interest of private as well as public law. In order to determine the legal character of such contracts, the provisions of the Civil Code were analysed, in particular the freedom to contract, as well as the provisions of the Labour Code within the area of the employment relationship characteristics and taking judgements of the Supreme Court into account. Ultimately, the legal nature of a given <b>management</b> <b>contract</b> depends on the circumstances in a given case. The analysed selected provisions of detailed acts which the legislator regulated <b>management</b> <b>contracts</b> with indicate that these contracts are civil law contracts. From the standpoint of public law, in particular tax law, this decides about the manner of the settlement of income from such contracts with tax authorities. Natural persons providing services in person based on agreements concerning the management of an enterprise, <b>management</b> <b>contracts,</b> or similar agreements are or are not VAT payers depending on the legal relationship within which they provide these service...|$|R
