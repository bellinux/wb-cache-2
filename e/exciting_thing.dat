5|$|In 2010, the Las Vegas Sun critic John Katsilometes, {{after being}} unimpressed by the initial show, said Believe had {{improved}} {{by reducing the}} narrative elements and focusing on the magic. In 2011, the Toronto Star wrote: “The show is easily the most <b>exciting</b> <b>thing</b> now on stage in Vegas!” That year the show attracted an estimated $150 million in ticket sales. The show currently has a ten-year performance contract that runs through 2019, and was the best selling magic show in Las Vegas as of 2013.|$|E

"The Next Messiah", a nine-minute [...] "ode to Barbra Streisand and the devil," [...] was [...] "tracked {{completely}} live, {{with all}} the transitions, and it's the most <b>exciting</b> <b>thing</b> I've ever been involved with in the studio. I wish {{the rest of the}} record had been more like that." [...] The song is [...] "actually three different songs that Johnathan Rice and myself wrote together," [...] according to Lewis. [...] "I happen to be a Barbra Streisand fan, and Barbra Streisand fancies a medley, so we discussed stringing the three songs together." ...|$|E
500|$|Pink Floyd {{began to}} use {{feedback}} from their early shows in 1966, inspired by the Who, whom they considered a formative influence. Shortly after arriving in London in 1966, Hendrix visited Marshall's music shop demanding an amp setup like Townshend's and manipulated electronic noises in ways that Townshend had pioneered. The Beatles were fans and socialised with Moon in particular during the mid-1960s. In 1965, Paul McCartney said the Who [...] "are the most <b>exciting</b> <b>thing</b> around" [...] and was inspired to write [...] "Helter Skelter" [...] in the group's [...] "heavy" [...] style; John Lennon borrowed the acoustic guitar style in [...] "Pinball Wizard" [...] for [...] "Polythene Pam".|$|E

500|$|Ryan Cracknell of Apollo Movie Guide, while {{echoing the}} praise for Holden's performance, {{nonetheless}} {{found that the}} film [...] "doesn't hold up so well today". Citing {{what he sees as}} slow pacing and [...] "long bouts of over-the-top dialogue", Cracknell compares the film to [...] "reading a textbook – not the most <b>exciting</b> <b>thing</b> in the world, but it does provide insights into and perspectives on the foundation of early horror movies and how many similarities carry over into movies half a century and more later." [...] Michael W. Phillips, Jr. concurs, calling the film [...] "a marked improvement on the original film [...] still a bit of a snooze, relying too much on forced comedy and not enough on suspense or fright." [...] Phillips again praises Holden's performance and also Pichel's portrayal of Sandor, but finds the rest of the cast weak.|$|E
500|$|Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown, {{producers}} at Universal Pictures, independently {{heard about}} Peter Benchley's novel Jaws. Brown came across {{it in the}} literature section of lifestyle magazine Cosmopolitan, then edited by his wife, Helen Gurley Brown. A small card written by the magazine's book editor gave {{a detailed description of}} the plot, concluding with the comment [...] "might make a good movie". The producers each read the book over the course of a single night and agreed the next morning that it was [...] "the most <b>exciting</b> <b>thing</b> that they had ever read" [...] and that they wanted to produce a film version, although they were unsure how it would be accomplished. They purchased the movie rights in 1973, before the book's publication, for approximately $175,000 (equivalent to $ million in [...] ). Brown claimed that had they read the book twice, they would never have made the film because they would have realized how difficult it would be to execute certain sequences.|$|E
500|$|Harrison taped {{the basic}} track for {{his version of}} [...] "Far East Man" [...] at Friar Park over August and September 1974, during {{sessions}} for his album Dark Horse. Having [...] "brushed up the lyrics a bit", {{as he puts it}} in I, Me, Mine, Harrison retained Newmark and Weeks from the sessions with Wood, and brought in keyboard player Billy Preston and saxophonist and arranger Tom Scott, both of whom would also be part of his all-American tour band. Leng describes [...] "Far East Man" [...] as [...] "the first Harisong to tap into 1970s soul" [...] and notes the [...] "supreme soul credentials" [...] of Newmark, as the former drummer with Sly and the Family Stone, and Weeks, who had supplied the highly regarded basslines on Donny Hathaway Live (1972). Newmark later recalled of his and Weeks' first sessions for Harrison: [...] "We were completely thrilled to be asked to play on his record … It was the most <b>exciting</b> <b>thing</b> to happen to me.

500|$|The video {{begins with}} {{close-up}} shots of several items, including a soft-drink glass, {{a bottle of}} milk, marshmallows, and pages from a briefcase, falling onto the ground. A QR code, which was said to produce the word [...] "LOVE" [...] when scanned, can be seen printed on the glass and bottle, {{and on the ground}} during the scene of the marshmallows falling. In their analysis of the video, Popjustice commented that the falling objects convey an environment of excitement, saying: [...] "the general idea here is that something exciting is happening and someone is so excited by the <b>exciting</b> <b>thing</b> that they have dropped their drink." [...] Several couples are shown removing their clothes, stripping down to their underwear, and proceeding to kiss and caress each other. Minogue then rises up from the inside of a [...] "mountain of writhing bodies" [...] and a flock of doves flies around them. Her attire consists of a black bra, similar to the one Madonna wore in the 1990 music video of [...] "Vogue", wore underneath a [...] "shredded" [...] white top coupled with white go-go boots and knee-pads. She continues singing the song while laying atop the pyramid of couples and changes her position as the song approaches its second verse. A convertible {{standing in the middle of}} a road is shown releasing a bunch of white balloons from its top. The scene switches back to Minogue, from where the camera pans upward to reveal a large white inflatable elephant floating in between two skyscrapers. The flash mob continues growing in size and the height of the pyramid increases. Minogue sways her hand above the participants of the mob, emphasising rings and jewellery designed by UK-based jeweller Shaun Leane. During of the bridge section of the song, Minogue is pulled inside the pyramid and the lighting is dimmed down. The song's breakdown coincides with scenes of a white horse galloping on a road amid various couples kissing each other. As the chorus begins, Minogue again rises up and stands atop the pyramid, which has greatly increased in height. Popjustice pointed out that the increment in the height of the pyramid is reflective of the lines of the song in which Minogue repeats the word [...] "higher". The camera switches to a distant view of the scene, showing the pyramid in between the skyscrapers and the floating elephant and balloons. The video ends with Minogue realising a dove in the air.|$|E

2500|$|The {{drawback}} of {{this method}} is that is very computational intensive, and systems for real time analysis are still to be developed. For the moment, a more interesting approach would be to map simple primitive objects to the person’s most important body parts ( [...] for example cylinders for the arms and neck, sphere for the head) and analyse the way these interact with each other. Furthermore, some abstract structures like super-quadrics and generalised cylinders {{may be even more}} suitable for approximating the body parts. The <b>exciting</b> <b>thing</b> about this approach is that the parameters for these objects are quite simple. In order to better model the relation between these, we make use of constraints and hierarchies between our objects.|$|E
2500|$|Hurdzan's {{career in}} golf {{actually}} began at his elementary school {{years when he}} was a caddie; he later became a greenkeeper to ASGCA past president and Ohio Historical Society inductee Jack Kidwell, and was a golf course superintendent before transitioning to a golf course architect. Howard Richman wrote that Hurdzan said that {{the first time he saw}} an overhead photo with the overlay of a golf course, was the most <b>exciting</b> <b>thing</b> for him. Hurdzan was influenced by Jack Kidwell and Geoffrey Cornish; according to Richman, [...] " [...] believes if there were two saints on earth they had to be architects Geoff Cornish and Kidwell." [...] He told Richman, [...] "Jack would take me to superintendent meetings, and I knew enough to keep my mouth shut and listen. I listened to all of the old-timers' stories and learned." [...] Hurdzan eventually became Kidwell's partner in golf course design, and subsequently owned the business.|$|E
2500|$|Working with Heide Museum for Rings of Saturn, firstly {{we agreed}} on a maquette. Then when I saw the site I knew I had to enlarge the work to do what I call 'conquer the {{landscape}}'. The Australian landscape is an enormously powerful landscape; vast and with clarity of atmosphere, {{and you never know}} in advance how work will look in it. [...] The landscape grips my imagination – I try to measure my work against the vast spaces of this country. Conquering the landscape does not rely on scale but simplicity and clarity of form expressing inner strength and tension. If my sculpture is outdoors or in the public domain I like it to arouse people's curiosity to explore the work. Multidimensional objects look different from every angle.

2500|$|In 2001, {{the band}} {{released}} White Blood Cells. The album's stripped-down garage rock sound drew critical acclaim in the US and beyond, making The White Stripes {{one of the}} more acclaimed bands of 2002, and forefront figures in the garage band revival of the time. John Peel, an influential DJ and the band's early advocate in the UK, said they were the most <b>exciting</b> <b>thing</b> he'd heard since Jimi Hendrix. The New York Times said of White, [...] "beneath the arty facade lies one of the most cagey, darkly original rockers to come along since Kurt Cobain." [...] The album was followed up in 2003 by the commercially and critically successful Elephant. The critic at Allmusic wrote that the album [...] "sounds even more pissed-off, paranoid and stunning than its predecessor ... darker and more difficult than White Blood Cells." [...] The album's first single, [...] "Seven Nation Army", became the band's signature song, reaching number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart for three weeks, winning the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Rock Song, and becoming an international sporting and protest anthem. The band's fifth album, Get Behind Me Satan, was recorded in White's own home and marked a change in the band's musical direction, with piano-driven melodies and experimentation with marimba and a more rhythm-based guitar playing by White.|$|E
