5|$|The duty officer, Captain Thomas Selvester, began {{a routine}} interrogation. Himmler {{admitted}} who he was, and Selvester had the prisoner searched. Himmler {{was taken to}} the headquarters of the Second British Army in Lüneburg, where Doctor Wells conducted a medical exam on him. The doctor attempted to examine the inside of Himmler's mouth, but the prisoner was reluctant to open it and <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> away. Himmler then bit into a hidden cyanide pill and collapsed onto the floor. He was dead within 15 minutes. Shortly afterward, Himmler's body was buried in an unmarked grave near Lüneburg. The grave's location remains unknown.|$|E

6000|$|... 'He {{meant it}} then?' Mullins <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> delicately towards the ground-ash on the table. 'I heard {{something}} about it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{enjoy the}} sunlight--the atmosphere--I go along this path, through that gate"--he <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> over his shoulder--"and round--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "King! War!" [...] said McTurk, <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{toward the}} wall, where hung {{a small wooden}} West-African war-drum, a gift to McTurk from a naval uncle.|$|R
60|$|G. (<b>Jerking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> over <b>his</b> shoulder.) She doesn't seem {{to thrive}} in this God-forsaken country, and there's The Butcha to be {{considered}} and all that, you know.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' said Mr. Bounderby, {{with his}} thumbs {{in the arms}} of <b>his</b> coat, and <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and {{shutting}} <b>his</b> eyes in confidence with the opposite wall: 'how it happens.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Shan't you call?' asked Berry, <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in the {{direction}} of the inn, which stood at the corner between two roads, its sign hanging under a bare horse-chestnut tree in front.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{seem to have}} a sort of {{geological}} museum here," [...] he said, as he sat down, <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{briefly in}} the direction of the brown dust and the crystalline fragments.|$|R
6000|$|From Dromore's {{face the}} {{chaffing}} look went, like a candle-flame blown out; and a coppery flush spread over it. For some seconds {{he did not}} speak, then, <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> towards the picture, he muttered gruffly: ...|$|R
6000|$|John <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> up a little, {{as though}} he had {{received}} a slight blow. The news was not palatable. He kept his form, however, and answered: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was sitting}} in the smoking room there, a few moments ago," [...] he began, <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> toward the door. [...] "There were some men talking--decent fellows, not dirty scandalmongers. They spoke of Louise Maurel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Over yonder by the cherry-tree," [...] said Myles, <b>jerking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in that direction. [...] "An I may go get it, I will trouble ye no more." [...] As {{he spoke}} {{he made a}} motion to leave them.|$|R
60|$|Gudrun went pale, and a {{darkness}} {{came over}} her eyes, like shame, {{she looked up}} with a certain supplication, almost slave-like. He glanced at her, and <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> a little.|$|E

60|$|Corliss started {{swiftly to}} his feet. Bishop <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> about. Two {{women and a}} man had {{staggered}} clumsily in through the door, and were standing just inside, momentarily blinded by the light.|$|E
60|$|The new Gefe Politico only <b>jerked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> sideways, {{and took}} a puff at his {{cigarette}} in sign of his agreement with this method for ridding the town of Gamacho and his inconvenient rabble.|$|E

50|$|In another macabre touch, {{instead of}} a graceful bow or bob of the head to one's dancing partner, a man who {{attended}} a bal des victimes would <b>jerk</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> sharply downwards in imitation of the moment of decapitation. Some sources suggest that women, too, adopted this salutation.|$|R
