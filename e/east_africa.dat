On 24 January, he {{sent a letter to}} the German Governor by courier through Portuguese <b>East</b> <b>Africa.</b> The courier was intercepted and the letter was never received. During the latter stages of the East African Campaign, after the German invasion of Portuguese <b>East</b> <b>Africa,</b> the German colonial army actually helped to suppress anti-Portuguese rebellions, among the Makombe and Barue peoples, worrying that African uprisings would destabilise the colonial order.|$|E

5|$|On 10 January, Seeadler {{departed}} for Bombay, where her boilers were repaired {{in a major}} overhaul. Workers from the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel were sent to do the work. Seeadler was back in service by May, and on 18 May she departed Bombay, arriving in <b>East</b> <b>Africa</b> on 31 May. Cormoran was meanwhile detached from <b>East</b> <b>Africa</b> and allowed to continue to the Pacific. The {{rest of the year}} was uneventful for Seeadler, though she became briefly involved in political developments in <b>East</b> <b>Africa.</b> The British Jameson Raid into the Transvaal in December 1895 threatened some 15,000 German nationals in the Transvaal, along with the investment of 500million gold marks in the country. The German governor considered ordering Seeadler to contribute a landing force to protect the German consul in Pretoria, the capital of the Transvaal, but the defeat of the Jameson Raid rendered the plan redundant. Seeadler nevertheless remained in <b>East</b> <b>Africa</b> while tensions cooled. In mid-February 1896, she went to Cape Town for her yearly overhaul.|$|E
5|$|On 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, {{proclaimed the}} colony of Africa Orientale Italiana (AOI, Italian <b>East</b> <b>Africa),</b> formed from Ethiopia (after the Italian {{victory in the}} Second Italo-Ethiopian War, fought 3 October 1935 – May 1936) and the {{existing}} Italian possessions of Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and France, which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in Italian <b>East</b> <b>Africa</b> {{a danger to the}} British and French colonies in <b>East</b> <b>Africa.</b> Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British supply routes along the coast of <b>East</b> <b>Africa,</b> the Gulf of Aden, Red Sea and the Suez Canal. (The Kingdom of Egypt remained neutral during World War II but the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 allowed the British to occupy Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.) Egypt, the Suez Canal, French Somaliland and British Somaliland were also vulnerable to an attack from Italian <b>East</b> <b>Africa</b> but the rearmament plans of the Comando Supremo (Italian General Staff) were not due to mature until 1942; in 1940 the Italian armed forces were not ready for military operations against a comparable power.|$|E

5|$|By late November 1917, the Germans in <b>East</b> <b>Africa</b> {{were left}} with few options {{if they wanted to}} {{continue}} the war. They were outnumbered drastically and were split up into several different columns. The two largest of these, under Theodor Tafel and Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, were completely cut off from each other. Although von Lettow-Vorbeck's column had defeated a large British force at the Battle of Mahiwa he had lost a large number of troops and expended virtually his entire supply of modern ammunition. With only antiquated weapons and no way of resupplying, von Lettow-Vorbeck decided to invade Portuguese <b>East</b> <b>Africa</b> in hopes of acquiring sufficient supplies to continue the war. There was no legal impediment to this attack; Germany had declared war on Portugal on 9 March 1916.|$|E
