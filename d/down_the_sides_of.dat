5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond {{of the idea of}} having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the legs. To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} {{scrambled to}} their feet and rushed forward while the sappers hurried to break <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the antitank ditch with picks and shovels. They advanced on a series of posts held by the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Italian 115th Infantry Regiment. Posts 49 and 47 were rapidly overrun, as was Post 46 in the second line beyond. Within half an hour Post 48 had also fallen and another company had taken Posts 45 and 44. The two remaining companies now advanced beyond these positions towards a low stone wall as artillery fire began to fall along the broken wire. The Italians fought from behind the wall until the Australians were inside it, attacking with hand grenades and bayonets. The two companies succeeded in taking 400 prisoners.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Bardia {{was fought}} over three days between 3 and 5 January 1941, {{as part of}} Operation Compass, the first {{military}} operation of the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War. It was the first battle {{of the war in}} which an Australian Army formation took part, the first to be commanded by an Australian general and the first to be planned by an Australian staff. Major General Iven Mackay's 6th Division assaulted the strongly held Italian fortress of Bardia, Libya, assisted by air support and naval gunfire, and under the cover of an artillery barrage. The 16th Infantry Brigade attacked at dawn from the west, where the defences were known to be weak. Sappers blew gaps in the barbed wire with Bangalore torpedoes and filled in and broke <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the anti-tank ditch with picks and shovels. This allowed the infantry and 23 Matilda II tanks of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment to enter the fortress and capture all their objectives, along with 8,000 prisoners.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally a {{predominantly}} white kit is worn including white shorts and socks. However the jersey usually features some form of red, like red stripes, crosses or chevrons. These colours are similar to other English sporting teams and are the colours used on the national flag. In 2008 a new kit was introduced featuring a red cross {{on the front and}} red strips <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the jersey, shorts and socks were white too with red strips. Also in 2008, the Rugby Football League chose to abandon the traditional English lion on the badge in favour of a much simpler shield and cross design.|$|E
25|$|The last {{maneuver}} {{requires that}} the health care provider face the woman's feet, {{as he or she}} will attempt to locate the fetus' brow. The fingers of both hands are moved gently <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the uterus toward the pubis. The side where there is resistance to the descent of the fingers toward the pubis is greatest is where the brow is located. If the head of the fetus is well-flexed, it should be on the opposite side from the fetal back. If the fetal head is extended though, the occiput is instead felt and is located on the same side as the back.|$|E

This time the assistant is on a door-sized rectangular board that spins about a central vertical axis. Again the thrower must execute {{a series of}} rapid, consistent and carefully timed throws to land knives on parts of the board {{not covered by the}} assistant's body. Sometimes the aim is to hit the back of the board in the moments that the assistant is turned away from the thrower. Other throwers have placed a vertical row of knives <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the assistant at the moments when the assistant turns to face them.|$|E

25|$|The cars as {{delivered}} featured rattan {{seats and}} incandescent lighting, staples of most pre-WWII subway cars in New York City. All {{areas of the}} cars were lit, as bulbs were placed along the center roofline and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> each car's interior. Additionally, pairs of bulbs on each end lit each end vestibule. As delivered, they did not come with fans, however windows and clerestory vents along the upper roof could be opened for ventilation. All windows were drop sash type (rather than rising sash type) for improved safety and {{to reduce the amount}} of draught in moving cars. Floors were made of wood (maple), and grab holds were provided along the roof for standees. Originally, these grab holds were made of leather (as on elevated trains), and later replaced with the steel grab holds that were IRT standard for many years.|$|E
25|$|At this stage, {{it is only}} {{slightly}} curved or may have no curve at all. The katanas gentle curvature is attained by a process of differential hardening or differential quenching: the smith coats the blade with several layers of a wet clay slurry, which is a special concoction unique to each sword maker, but generally composed of clay, water and any or none of ash, grinding stone powder, or rust. This process is called tsuchioki. The edge of the blade is coated with a thinner layer than the sides and spine of the sword, heated, and then quenched in water (few sword makers use oil to quench the blade). The slurry causes only the blade's edge to be hardened and also causes the blade to curve due to the difference in densities of the micro-structures in the steel. When steel with a carbon content of 0.7% is heated beyond 750°C, it enters the austenite phase. When austenite is cooled very suddenly by quenching in water, the structure changes into martensite, {{which is a very}} hard form of steel. When austenite is allowed to cool slowly, its structure changes into a mixture of ferrite and pearlite which is softer than martensite. This process also creates the distinct line <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the blade called the hamon, which is made distinct by polishing. Each hamon and each smith's style of hamon is distinct.|$|E

500|$|Cerro Azul is {{responsible}} for several of South America's largest recorded eruptions, in 1846 and 1932. In 1846, an effusive eruption formed the vent {{at the site of}} present-day Quizapu crater on the northern flank of Cerro Azul and sent lava flowing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the volcano, creating a lava field 8–9 square kilometres (3–3.5 square miles) in area. Phreatic and Strombolian volcanism between 1907 and 1932 excavated this crater. In 1932, one of the largest explosive eruptions of the 20thcentury occurred at Quizapu Crater and sent [...] of ash into the atmosphere. The volcano's most recent eruption was in 1967.|$|E

500|$|The head is {{somewhat}} large {{in proportion to}} the body, with small ears, and has a unique feature called a [...] "toad eye" [...] caused by extra fleshiness of the eyelids, which helps to deflect water and provide extra insulation. As with most cold-weather pony breeds, the Exmoor grows a winter coat consisting of a highly insulating woolly underlayer and a topcoat of longer, oily hairs that prevent the undercoat from becoming waterlogged by diverting water <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the animal to fall from just a few drip areas. The mane and tail are thick and long, and the dock of the tail is of a type common in cold-weather ponies, having coarse hairs, called a [...] "frost cap," [...] "snow chute," [...] or [...] "ice tail" [...] that deflects rainwater away from the groin and underbelly areas to fall from the long hairs {{on the back of the}} hind legs.|$|E
500|$|The {{fountain}} uses [...] per hour, 97% {{of which}} is recycled back into the system. [...] Getting the water to the spout took ingenuity. Although consideration was given to omitting a LED tile, {{it was determined that}} the images would then look as though they were each missing a tooth. Instead, one tile in each tower is recessed about [...] to allow the installation of [...] clear tubing for the water nozzle. The water regularly spills over the fountain and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the towers and intermittently spouts from the nozzle. Two essential custom fittings contribute to the artistic vision of the fountain: a custom glass block at the upper edge for guiding the water's descent while remaining unobtrusive, and a plastic nozzle fitted to the stainless steel frame to control the rate of water flow and reduce liability to the city for any injuries sustained by the fountain's interactive participants. The interactive participants are usually children playing in the stream from the water spout or under the cascade. The risk that the spouting water would knock people down made the design both a legal and a physical challenge.|$|E
500|$|The jejy voatavo is a chordophone that {{traditionally}} has two sisal strings, three frets and a calabash resonator, although modern versions may {{have as many}} as eleven or thirteen strings, typically made of steel. [...] A maximum of four of these are strung over the frets, while the rest are strung lengthwise <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the neck and are strummed with the fingers in accompaniment to the primary melody which is played with a bow. This more elaborate jejy voatavo is especially popular among the Betsileo of the southern Highlands and the Betsimisaraka of the southeast, who play it in accompaniment to their sung epic poems, called rija. In 19th-century Highlands society under the Kingdom of Imerina, the jejy voatavo was considered to be a slave instrument which only mature men were permitted to play. The lokanga, an evolved jejy with the sound box carved to resemble a three-stringed fiddle, is popular among the Southern Antandroy and Bara ethnic groups. The simplest form of instrument in this family is the jejy lava (musical bow), believed to have been brought to Madagascar by settlers from mainland Africa.|$|E
