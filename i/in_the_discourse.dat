[...] Marianne Hirsch wrote an influential essay on post-memory called [...] "Family Pictures: Maus, Mourning, and Post-Memory", later expanded into a book called Family Frames: Photography, Narrative, and Postmemory.

500|$|... "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] is {{the longest}} of the 1819 odes with 8 stanzas {{containing}} 10 lines each. The poem begins by describing {{the state of the}} poet, using negative statements to intensify the description of the poet's physical state such as [...] "numbless pains" [...] and [...] "not through envy of thy happy lot" [...] (lines 1–5). While the ode is written [...] "to a Nightingale", the emphasis of the first line is placed upon the narrator rather than the bird, and Helen Vendler suggests that the negation of the reader as a party <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discourse</b> happens just as the song of the nightingale becomes the [...] "voice of pure self-expression". In the third stanza, the poet asks the nightingale to [...] "Fade far away", casting it off just as the narrator in [...] "Ode to Indolence" [...] rejects the Love, Ambition, and Poesy and the poet in [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] banishes the figures on the urn to silence. In the fourth stanza, the poet states that he will fly to the nightingale rather than it to him, moving upon the [...] "wings of Poesy", which leaves Walter Jackson Bate to believe that while the poet intends to identify with the bird by describing the poem as being [...] "to" [...] it, the real identification in the narrative exists between the poet and his perceptions of the nightingale's song. In its closing, the poem questions whether the bird's song has been real or part of a dream: [...] "Was it a vision, or a waking dream? / Fled is that music:—do I wake or sleep?" [...] (lines 79–80), and the theme of imagination once again arises as the poet appears, according to Timothy Hilton, unable to distinguish between his own artistic imagination and the song which he believes to have spurred it into action.|$|E
