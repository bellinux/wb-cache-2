FV cows had less visible bone structure in the concerning area, and their body shapes showed greater convexity, i.e. the surface was less sunken between the bones. As a result, the extracted profiles expressed less distortion from a spatial connecting line or described smaller areas. The camera traits were thus more susceptible to deviation in depth measurement {{as well as to}} smoothing and rounding values. The FV cows’ convex body shape could also be recognized in smaller max-min differences for the camera traits dealing with diagonal sections through the rear area or the area under the <b>hip</b> to <b>hip</b> <b>connection</b> compared to HF cows.|$|R
30|$|Equation  6 is deduced {{under the}} {{assumptions}} that {{the geometry of}} the resonance cavity is significantly less than the acoustic wavelength. It was also assumed that the wave motion and mass distribution conditions in the <b>connection</b> <b>tube</b> and the resonant cavity can be ignored. These hypotheses are hard to meet if the ratios of height and width are too large or too small. In addition, when the ratios of height and width become too small, the transverse wave is dominant in the resonant cavity, and the intersection area of the cavity and connecting tube becomes larger. This leads to strong three-dimensional effects in the intersection area and therefore reduces {{the accuracy of the}} calculation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as an identifier-locator (ID-LOC) separation scheme, in which the 128 -bit Host Identity Tag (HIT) {{is used as a}}n ID and the IP address of the host is used as a LOC. In HIP, the mobility control operations are performed based on a centralized Rendezvous Server (RVS) that acts as a mobility anchor for mobile nodes, in which all the HIP control messages are passed through the RVS server. However, this centralized mobility scheme has some limitation, such as the service degradation by a point of failure and the overhead of centralized anchor. In this paper, we propose the two schemes for distributed mobility management (DMM) : HIP-DMM-Push and HIP-DMM-Pull. From the numerical analysis, it is shown that the proposed DMM schemes can provide better performance than the existing centralized scheme, and that the pull-based distributed control scheme (HIP-DMM-Pull) provides the best performance among the candidate mobility schemes in terms of the processing overhead at the central RVS server and the <b>HIP</b> <b>connection</b> setup delays. The proposed distributed control schemes can be used to effectively provide the mobility support in HIP-based wireless/mobile HIP networks, compared to the existing centralized control schemes. This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the existing centralized schemes for HIP mobility control. In Section III, we propose the two distributed mobility control schemes. Section IV analyzes and compares the existing and proposed schemes in terms of the <b>HIP</b> <b>connection</b> setup delays, and the processing overhead at the central RVS server. Section V concludes this paper. II. EXISTING HIP SCHEME In existing schemes for HIP mobility control, all HIT-IPv 4 mapping entries are stored at centralized RVS.

30|$|As none of {{the camera}} traits could fully {{describe}} the individual changes in fat layer or body condition by itself, the correlations to BFT were low or not significant. An additional explanation was, that {{none of the}} traits dealt with the exact BFT measurement point, which would have been difficult to detect from the TOF recordings. The significant correlations to BFT occurred mainly with traits dealing with the tailhead region, but irregularly also with the diagonal sections between the hips and the tail region and the area under the <b>hip</b> to <b>hip</b> <b>connection.</b> For inferential statistics aiming to predict BFT from the presented camera traits, it could be promising to consider a set of predictors that delivered information from the whole surrounding area of the BFT measurement point (Weber et al. 2014).|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We compare {{computational}} resources {{required for}} handling control {{plane of the}} Host Identity Protocol (HIP) using Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) versus Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) encryption algorithms with keys of equivalent strength. We show that servers would establish almost three times more <b>HIP</b> <b>connections</b> per second when ECC is used for generating the session key. For devices with low computational power such as Nokia N 810 Internet Tablet, the use of ECC would notably reduce the delay to establish a HIP association. Unless compatibility with legacy RSA/DSA-only systems is needed, the Host Identity may be an ECC key as well, but such a modification would bring only 50 percent additional performance with the current default keys. However the situation becomes different under higher security requirements when employing ECC for the host identification boosts the performance more than four times, and we consider ECC Host Identities desirable in that case.

40|$|A {{recently}} developed numerical model, describing a self amplification and structure formation process {{which is used}} to model the initial nonlinear growth phase of edge localized modes (ELMs), is applied to the JET tokamak. Connection length simulations of the magnetic topology, including only error fields, for JET reveal the existence of small, so called short <b>connection</b> length flux <b>tubes.</b> Such a configuration is used as starting point for the model. Thermoelectric currents are assumed to flow in the short <b>connection</b> length flux <b>tubes</b> and add additional magnetic perturbations which change the magnetic topology severely. The change in magnetic topology leads to the formation of new, much larger short <b>connection</b> length flux <b>tubes</b> that can conduct much larger currents through the plasma edge. The current density inside the flux tubes is assumed to be constant to calculate the total current. This self amplification process leads to the formation of patterns, known as footprints, on various segments of the inner wall throughout the vessel. The resulting footprints are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Literature {{results show}} that the {{pressure}} piling phenomenon {{is the result of the}} combination of: (1) the precompression effect arising from the jet flow from the ignition vessel); (2) the turbulence induced by the fast flame propagation (jet ignition) in the secondary vessel; and (3) the vent flowing toward the ignition vessel, which mitigates the peak pressure. To control the severity of the explosion in the second vessel it is possible to either limit precompression or to reduce the characteristic ratio between the "reaction" and "venting" times. A mathematical model of the pressure piling phenomenon is proposed herein to study the possibility of reducing the peak pressure in the second vessel by limiting the turbulence level induced and thus increasing the reaction time with respect to the venting time. More precisely, the effect of geometry obtained by using divergent <b>connection</b> <b>tubes</b> from the ignition vessel to the second vessel and by varying the volume ratio between the two vessels has been evaluated, demonstrating that small modifications in the design will prevent the catastrophic behavior of pressure piling. © 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers...|$|R
