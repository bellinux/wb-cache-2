5|$|The tetroxide and {{a related}} {{compound}} potassium osmate are important oxidants for chemical synthesis, despite being very poisonous. For the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, which uses osmate for {{the conversion of}} a double bond into a vicinal diol, Karl Barry Sharpless won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2001. OsO4 <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>expensive</b> for this use, so KMnO4 is often used instead, even though the yields are less for this cheaper chemical reagent.|$|E

Experts interviewed by New Scientist affirmed osmium(VIII) oxide's toxicity, though some highlighted the difficulties of using it in a weapon: osmium(VIII) oxide <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>expensive.</b> The osmium(VIII) oxide may be destroyed by the blast; remaining toxic fumes may also be dispersed by the blast.|$|E
25|$|Residents that do {{not receive}} enough water in summer are forced to buy water from water tankers. This water <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>expensive</b> {{compared}} to subsidized tap water.

Furthermore, {{there is a risk}} of contamination in the water tankers and in roof tanks.|$|E
25|$|Other {{heavy metals}} have been {{considered}} {{as an alternative to}} lead. One example is bismuth which has a similar density (SG=9.78) and a low melting point. It is less toxic, and its salts are highly insoluble which limits absorption by the body. Tungsten (SG=19.25) is another possible replacement for lead, but it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>expensive</b> by comparison, both as a material and to manufacture in suitable shapes.|$|E

25|$|People {{who choose}} to buy their dress may opt for finer fabrics, such as poplin, grosgrain, percale, cotton, wool, cassimere, broadcloth, Russell cord, or corded/ribbed material. For silk, there are a range of types {{including}} artificial silk/rayon, Ottoman (i.e. ribbed or corded silk), taffeta, satin, alpaca, true silk, shot silk, or a mixture. Pure Ottoman silk is rarely used except for official gowns, as it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>expensive.</b> Some gowns may be trimmed with gimp lace, cords, buttons, {{or other forms of}} decoration.|$|E
25|$|In the past, a kimono {{would often}} be entirely taken apart for washing, and then re-sewn for wearing. This {{traditional}} washing method is called arai hari. Because the stitches {{must be taken}} out for washing, traditional kimono need to be hand sewn. Arai hari <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>expensive</b> and difficult {{and is one of}} the causes of the declining popularity of kimono. Modern fabrics and cleaning methods have been developed that eliminate this need, although the traditional washing of kimono is still practiced, especially for high-end garments.|$|E
25|$|This {{method is}} a form of mass spectrometry, and is {{sometimes}} referred to by that name. It uses the fact that charged particles are deflected in a magnetic field and the amount of deflection depends upon the particle's mass. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>expensive</b> for the quantity produced, as it has an extremely low throughput, but it can allow very high purities to be achieved. This method is often used for processing small amounts of pure isotopes for research or specific use (such as isotopic tracers), but is impractical for industrial use.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{a country}} where capital and land are {{abundant}} but labor is scarce as a comparative advantage in goods that require lots of capital and land, but little labor—grains. If capital and land are abundant, their prices are low. As they are the main factors {{in the production of}} grain, the price of grain is also low—and thus attractive for both local consumption and export. Labor-intensive goods on the other hand <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>expensive</b> to produce since labor is scarce and its price is high. Therefore, the country is better off importing those goods.|$|E
25|$|Other {{examples}} include jumping {{in front of}} cars as done in Russia. The driving conditions and roads are dangerous with many people trying to scam drivers by jumping in front of expensive-looking cars or crashing into them. Hit and runs are very common and insurance companies notoriously specialize in denying claims. Two-way insurance coverage <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>expensive</b> and almost completely unavailable for vehicles over ten years old–the drivers can only obtain basic liability. Because Russian courts do not like using verbal claims, most people have dashboard cameras installed to warn would-be perpetrators or provide evidence for/against claims.|$|E
25|$|The {{initiation}} {{into these}} Nnukwu-Ozo titles was and still <b>is,</b> <b>very</b> <b>expensive.</b> Historically, the initiation ceremony into {{the secrets of}} the Nnukwu-Ozo involved the very painful and prestigious Ichi scarification, by which these men were identified in public. The Ichi scarification as part of the ritual has been discontinued in modern times for aesthetic reasons. The last bearer of Ichi marks, Chief Ezenwosu died in the early twentieth century. Other distinctive pieces of regalia that identify the Ozo title holder and the Nnukwu-Ozo title holder in Awka-Etiti are the red cap (with eagle feathers for the Nnukwu-Ozo), the horse tail fly whisk, the round cow hide fan and the elephant tusk.|$|E

Many laboratory instruments <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>expensive.</b> This <b>is</b> justifiable in many cases, as such equipment can perform very specific tasks employing cutting-edge technology. However, there are devices employed in the laboratory that are not highly-technological but still <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>expensive.</b> This <b>is</b> the case of many automated devices, which perform tasks that could easily be done by simple and low-cost devices like simple robotic arms, universal (open-source) electronic modules, or 3D printers.|$|R
25|$|According to the Islamic law, Taiwanese Muslims need to {{be buried}} within maximum of 72 hours after the death. This poses a {{challenge}} since the general Chinese burial in Taiwan often takes weeks or months after the person has died. No cremation is used and the dead is buried in the ground. Burial at the sea is permitted if land cannot be reached within 72 hours. Ali Ma Ju-hu, the then-President of Chinese Muslim Association in 2006, had a discussion with the World Assembly of Muslim Youth in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, {{on the possibility of}} finding help in funding burial ground for Muslims in Taipei since the land <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>expensive.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{price of}} energy inputs and the {{environmental}} costs of every nuclear power plant continue long after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity. Both nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities must be decommissioned, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses. After a cooling-off period that may {{last as long as}} a century, reactors must be dismantled and cut into small pieces to be packed in containers for final disposal. The process <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>expensive,</b> time-consuming, dangerous for workers, hazardous to the natural environment, and presents new opportunities for human error, accidents or sabotage.|$|E
25|$|Barrow is the {{economic}} {{center of the}} North Slope Borough, the city's primary employer. Numerous businesses provide support services to oil field operations. State and federal agencies are employers. The midnight sun has attracted tourism, and arts and crafts provide some cash income. Because transporting food to the city <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>expensive,</b> many residents continue to rely upon subsistence food sources. Whale, seal, polar bear, walrus, waterfowl, caribou, and fish are harvested from the coast or nearby rivers and lakes.
