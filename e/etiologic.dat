5|$|A {{number of}} {{protozoa}} can cause gastroenteritis – most commonly Giardia lamblia – but Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., {{and other species}} have also been implicated. As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children. Giardia occurs more commonly in the developing world, but this <b>etiologic</b> agent causes this type of illness to some degree nearly everywhere. It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend day care, {{men who have sex}} with men, and following disasters.|$|E

25|$|The {{identification}} of substance-induced versus independent psychiatric symptoms or disorders has important treatment implications and often constitutes {{a challenge in}} daily clinical practice. Similar patterns of comorbidity and risk factors in individuals with substance induced disorder and those with independent non-substance induced psychiatric symptoms suggest that the two conditions may share underlying <b>etiologic</b> factors.|$|E
25|$|B. henselae is the <b>etiologic</b> {{agent for}} peliosis hepatis, which {{is defined as}} a {{vascular}} proliferation of sinusoid hepatic capillaries resulting in blood-filled spaces in the liver in HIV patients and organ transplant recipients. Peliosis hepatis can be associated with peliosis of the spleen, as well as bacillary angiomatosis of the skin in HIV patients.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, {{patients}} and their doctors (GPs) have different perceptions of the efficacy of diagnostic and dietary interventions in IBS. Patients consider food intolerance and GPs regard lack of fibre as the main <b>etiologic</b> dietary factor. It {{has been suggested that}} Dutch GPs explore the patients' expectations and potentially incorporate these in their approach to IBS patients.|$|E
25|$|The hantaviruses are a {{relatively}} newly discovered genus of viruses. An outbreak of Korean hemorrhagic fever among American and Korean soldiers during the Korean War (1950–1953) was later {{found to be}} caused by a hantavirus infection. More than 3000 troops became ill with symptoms that included renal failure, generalized hemorrhage, and shock. It had a 10 percent mortality rate. This outbreak sparked a 25-year search for the <b>etiologic</b> agent. Ho-Wang Lee, a South Korean virologist, Karl M. Johnson, an American tropical virologist, and colleagues isolated Hantaan virus in 1976 from the lungs of striped field mice.|$|E
25|$|Setosphaeria rostrata is a {{thermophilic}} fungus with an asexual reproductive form {{treated in the}} genus Exserohilum (as Exserohilum rostratum). This fungus is a common plant pathogen, causing leaf spots as well as crown rot and root rot in grasses. It {{is also found in}} soils and on textiles in subtropical and tropical regions. Exserohilum rostratum is one of the 35 Exserohilum species implicated uncommonly as opportunistic pathogens of humans where it is an <b>etiologic</b> agent of sinusitis, keratitis and CNS vasculitis as well as cutaneous and subcutaneous mycoses. Infections caused by Exserohilum are most often seen in regions with hot climates particularly Israel, India and Southern USA.|$|E
25|$|It {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1993 from rodents collected near {{the home of}} one of the initial patients with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Four Corners region of the western United States. Isolation was achieved through blind passage in Peromyscus maniculatus (deer mouse) and subsequent adaptation to growth in Vero E6 cells. Additional viral strains have also been isolated from P. maniculatus associated with a fatal case in California and P. leucopus from the vicinity of probable infection of a New York case. Black Creek Canal virus was isolated from S. hispidus collected near the residence of a human case in Dade County, Florida. Another <b>etiologic</b> agent of HCPS, Bayou virus, was first isolated from the vicinity of Monroe, Louisiana.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{involves}} {{removal of}} the <b>etiologic</b> mass and decompressive craniectomy. Brain herniation can cause severe disability or death. In fact, when herniation is visible on a CT scan, the prognosis for a meaningful recovery of neurological function is poor. The patient may become paralyzed {{on the same side}} as the lesion causing the pressure, or damage to parts of the brain caused by herniation may cause paralysis on the side opposite the lesion. Damage to the midbrain, which contains the reticular activating network which regulates consciousness, will result in coma. Damage to the cardio-respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata will cause respiratory arrest and (secondarily) cardiac arrest. Current investigation is underway regarding the use of neuroprotective agents during the prolonged post-traumatic period of brain hypersensitivity associated with the syndrome.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the vitamin}} A was not {{identified}} until the 20th century, written observations of conditions created by deficiency of this nutrient appeared much earlier in history. Sommer (2008) classified historical accounts related to vitamin A and/or manifestations of deficiency as follows: [...] "Ancient" [...] accounts; 18th- to 19th-century clinical descriptions (and their purported <b>etiologic</b> associations); early 20th-century laboratory animal experiments, and clinical and epidiomologic observations that identified {{the existence of}} this unique nutrient and manifestations of its deficiency.|$|E
2500|$|Temporomandibular {{disorder}} (TMD, also termed [...] "temporomandibular joint pain-dysfunction syndrome") is {{pain and}} dysfunction of the TMJ and {{the muscles of}} mastication (the muscles that move the jaw). TMD does not fit neatly into any one <b>etiologic</b> category since the pathophysiology is poorly understood and it represents a range of distinct disorders with multifactorial etiology. TMD accounts {{for the majority of}} pathology of the TMJ, and it is the second most frequent cause of orofacial pain after dental pain (i.e. toothache).|$|E
2500|$|Some {{forms of}} {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder (OCD) may be genetically linked to Tourette's, or an alternate {{expression of the}} condition; genetic studies show an increased rate of tics and obsessive-compulsive behaviors or OCD in relatives of patients with Tourette's, and [...] "reinforce the idea {{that at least some}} forms of OCD are etiologically related to TS, and may, therefore, be a variant expression of the same <b>etiologic</b> factors that are important for the expression of tics." [...] Further evidence supporting that OCD and Tourette's are alternative expressions of a common genetic vulnerability is that males inheriting the genetic vulnerability are more likely to display tics, while females are more likely to display obsessive-compulsive traits.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Blehert et al. {{described}} the fungus associated with white-nose syndrome {{as a member}} of the genus Geomyces. In 2009, Gargas et al. were the first to describe the fungus as a unique species; the specific name they chose, [...] "", means [...] "destroying". The fungus was definitively identified as the cause of the syndrome in bats, according to research published in 2011 by scientists at the United States Geological Survey. It was previously unknown whether this fungus was the primary cause of WNS or was an opportunistic pathogen associated with the disease, though strong evidence suggested that the fungus was the <b>etiologic</b> agent. In 2013, an analysis of the phylogenetic relationship indicated that this fungus was more closely related to the genus Pseudogymnoascus than to the genus Geomyces changing its Latin binomial to Pseudogymnoascus destructans.|$|E
2500|$|Personal hygiene care {{consists}} of proper brushing and flossing daily. The purpose of oral hygiene is to minimize any <b>etiologic</b> agents of {{disease in the}} mouth. [...] The primary focus of brushing and flossing is to remove and prevent the formation of plaque or dental biofilm. [...] Plaque consists mostly of bacteria. [...] As the amount of bacterial plaque increases, the tooth is more vulnerable to dental caries when carbohydrates in the food are left on teeth after every meal or snack. [...] A toothbrush {{can be used to}} remove plaque on accessible surfaces, but not between teeth or inside pits and fissures on chewing surfaces. [...] When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from areas that could otherwise develop proximal caries but only if the depth of sulcus has not been compromised. Other adjunct oral hygiene aids include interdental brushes, water picks, and mouthwashes.|$|E
2500|$|Led by Joseph Matarazzo, in 1977, APA added a {{division}} devoted to health psychology. At the first divisional conference, Matarazzo delivered {{a speech that}} {{played an important role}} in defining health psychology. He defined the new field in this way, [...] "Health psychology is the aggregate of the specific educational, scientific and professional contributions of the discipline of psychology to the promotion and maintenance of health, the prevention and treatment of illness, the identification of diagnostic and <b>etiologic</b> correlates of health, illness and related dysfunction, and the analysis and improvement of the healthcare system and health policy formation." [...] In the 1980s, similar organizations were established elsewhere. In 1986, the BPS established a Division of Health Psychology. The European Health Psychology Society was also established in 1986. Similar organizations were established in other countries, including Australia and Japan. Universities began to develop doctoral level training programs in health psychology. In the US, post-doctoral level health psychology training programs were established for individuals who completed a doctoral degree in clinical psychology.|$|E
2500|$|... "La bruxomanie" [...] (a French term, {{translates}} to bruxomania) was suggested by Marie Pietkiewics in 1907. In 1931, Frohman first {{coined the term}} bruxism. Occasionally recent medical publications will use the word bruxomania with bruxism, to denote specifically bruxism that occurs while awake; however, this term can be considered historical and the modern equivalent would be awake bruxism or diurnal bruxism. It {{has been shown that}} the type of research into bruxism has changed over time. Overall between 1966 and 2007, most of the research published was focused on occlusal adjustments and oral splints. Behavioral approaches in research declined from over 60% of publications in the period 1966–86 to about 10% in the period 1997–2007. In the 1960s, a periodontist named Sigurd Peder Ramfjord championed the theory that occlusal factors were responsible for bruxism. Generations of dentists were educated by this ideology in the prominent textbook on occlusion of the time, however therapy centered around removal of occlusal interference remained unsatisfactory. The belief among dentists that occlusion and bruxism are strongly related is still widespread, however the majority of researchers now disfavor malocclusion as the main <b>etiologic</b> factor in favor of a more multifactorial, biopsychosocial model of bruxism.|$|E
