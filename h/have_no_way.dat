5|$|As {{soon as the}} two armies {{were drawn}} up, a clamour arose from the German ranks, loudly {{demanding}} that Chnodomar and his entourage of chiefs should dismount and lead {{the main body of}} German foot warriors from the front. Chnodomar and the chiefs immediately complied. In so doing, Chnodomar forfeited any strategic control of the battle, as, trapped in the centre of the action, he would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of knowing what was happening in other sectors. Julian, on the other hand, maintained a detached position throughout (with his escort) and so was able to respond to events all over the field, such as the initial rout of his cavalry. It is unclear exactly where Julian was stationed but it was likely in the gap between the two Roman lines.|$|E
5|$|Before leaving, {{they attend}} Ron's brother Bill's wedding, {{but during the}} {{reception}} the Ministry of Magic finally falls to Voldemort and the wedding is attacked. They flee to 12 Grimmauld Place in London, the family home of Sirius Black that Harry had inherited a year before. They identify R.A.B. as Sirius' brother Regulus Black, and learn from the house-elf Kreacher, Slytherin's locket was stolen {{from the house and}} then seized by Dolores Umbridge of the Ministry of Magic. They infiltrate the Ministry of Magic using Polyjuice Potion and take back the locket, but <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to destroy it. With the Ministry now after them, the trio goes on the run across the countryside. Under the object's evil influence and the strain of constant vigilance, they argue and Ron leaves.|$|E

25|$|In his {{references}} {{to my own}} work, Gould includes at least nine citations that involve {{more than just an}} expression of Gould's opinion; in these citations Gould purportedly paraphrases my views. Yet in eight of the nine cases, Gould's representation of these views is false, misleading, or grossly caricatured. Nonspecialists could <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of knowing any of this without reading the cited sources. While an author can occasionally make an inadvertent mistake in paraphrasing another, it appears Gould's paraphrases are consistently slanted to serve his own message.|$|E
25|$|Many {{differentials}} <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> {{of limiting}} {{the amount of}} engine power that gets sent to its attached output shafts. As a result, if a tire loses traction on acceleration, either because of a low-traction situation (e.g., - driving on gravel or ice) or the engine power overcomes available traction, the tire that is not slipping receives little or no power from the engine. In very low traction situations, this can prevent the vehicle from moving at all. To overcome this, there are several designs of differentials that can either {{limit the amount of}} slip (these are called 'limited-slip' differentials) or temporarily lock the two output shafts together to ensure that engine power reaches all driven wheels equally.|$|E

25|$|Climate {{change was}} {{referred}} to in several of Giddens’s books from the mid-1990s onwards, but was not discussed at length until {{the publication of his}} work The Politics of Climate Change in 2009. Climate change, Giddens says, constitutes a fundamental threat to the future of industrial civilisation as it spreads across the globe. Given that is the case, he asks, why are countries around the world doing so little to counter its advance? Many reasons are involved, but the prime one is the historical novelty of humanly induced climate change itself. No previous civilisation intervened into nature on a level remotely similar to that which we do on an everyday level today. We have no previous experience of dealing with such an issue and especially one of such global scope, or of the dangers it poses. Those dangers hence appear as abstract, and located at some indefinite point in the future. ‘Giddens’s paradox’ consists of the following theorem. We are likely put off responding adequately to climate change until major catastrophes unequivocally connected to it occur; but by then by definition it will be too late. For we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of reversing the build-up of greenhouses gases that is driving the transformation of the world’s climate. Some such gases will be in the atmosphere for centuries.|$|E

But together with La Forge they discover a Romulan plot and defeating a similarly cloaked Romulan operative, Ro and La Forge alert the crew and return to normal, warning Picard and averting disaster.|$|E

500|$|To do this, every able-bodied Athenian male {{would be}} {{required}} to man the ships. This in turn meant that the Athenians must prepare to abandon Athens. Persuading the Athenians to take this course was undoubtedly {{one of the highlights of}} Themistocles's career. As Holland has it: [...] "What precise heights of oratory he attained, what stirring and memorable phrases he pronounced, we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of knowing...only by the effect it had on the assembly can we gauge what surely must have been its electric and vivifying quality—for Themistocles' audacious proposals, when put to the vote, were ratified. The Athenian people, facing the gravest moment of peril in their history, committed themselves once and for all to the alien element of the sea, and put their faith in a man whose ambitions many had long profoundly dreaded." [...] His proposals accepted, Themistocles issued orders for the women and children of Athens to be sent to the city of Troezen, safely inside the Peloponnesus. He was then able to travel to a meeting of the Allies, at which he proposed his strategy; with the Athenian fleet fully committed to the defence of Greece, the other Allies accepted his proposals.|$|E
500|$|Fever is {{considered}} to be a prominent example of Minogue's constant [...] "reinventions". The image she adopted during this period was described by Baker as [...] "slick, minimalist and postmodern", and it was seen as a step forward from the [...] "camp-infused" [...] tone of Light Years. Larissa Dubecki from The Age used the term [...] "nu-disco diva" [...] to describe Minogue during this period. Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club opined that Minogue's public image and her persona in her music videos [...] "presented herself as a mechanical muse whose every gesture snapped and locked into place with the sound of a vacuum seal". He further remarked that the singer's [...] "hygienic coo summoned a cool sort of cyborg soul, and her videos showed her gliding through sleek futurescapes, tonguing the sweet-and-sour tang of a techno kiss". Adrien Begrand from PopMatters felt that the simplicity of the album made it a [...] "classy piece of work" [...] and commented that Minogue's experience and choice of collaborators resulted in [...] "the thirtysomething Minogue upstaging soulless, brainless music by younger American pop tarts like Britney [...] and Christina [...] ". Robbie Daw from Idolator pointed out that Britney Spear's recording of her 2004 hit [...] "Toxic", Madonna's comeback album Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), Paris Hilton's musical debut Paris (2006), and radio stations' shift towards playing [...] "more groove-oriented sounds" [...] all followed the release of Fever, although he admitted that [...] "we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of knowing whether Kylie Minogue's eighth studio album was directly responsible for these pop happenings". Chris True from AllMusic, in his biography of Minogue, commented that the release of the album and lead single [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] cemented her position as an international music icon, saying [...] "Her place in pop music history would be consolidated in 2001, and she would be reintroduced to America after more than a decade as well".|$|E
