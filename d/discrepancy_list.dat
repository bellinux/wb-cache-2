METHODS: To find candidate information services, we conducted a literature search and examined primary care physicians' websites, especially Dutch websites. Semi-structured depth interviews with the stakeholders, Dutch patients and GPs, were done {{to arrive at a}} final checklist. We then conducted a survey to elicit the level of importance associated with each service on the checklist. The data underwent statistical analysis and relevant requirements were formulated. The requirements were then validated by interviews. General website quality and usability aspects were elicited from the literature. RESULTS: The research resulted in a checklist of 38 selected information services including their priority ratings for patients and GPs; a <b>discrepancy</b> <b>list</b> between GP and patient priorities; and a requirements document containing information services (14 static and 6 functional), and general quality and usability aspects (8 and 5). CONCLUSION: The following items occurred in the top 10 of both user groups: general practice information, information of local public health institutions, self-help information, repeat prescription, links to health web sites. At the bottom on both priority lists were: links to journals, tests and forums. Dutch GPs are much more selective in terms of which information services to provide on-line. Discrepancy between the two groups concerns on-line services that seem to require a change to the GP's workflow, or those services that are not recognized for reimbursing the GP. Although the Dutch patients' requirements seem to generalize to other patients, the conflict list might depend on the primary care syste...|$|E

Specifically, the project takes {{the concept of}} Single Windows (often used {{in the sense that}} governments offer a single portal or {{interface}} to which businesses can submit information, supporting re-ruse by multiple agencies and coordination of government activities) and includes the business side; creating an Extended Single Window. An Extended Single Window includes business information systems and platforms and supports the re-use of business data, both for supporting new business applications and for making it easier to connect to government single windows. The project is not alone in this ambition. For example, in the FP 7 project CASSANDRA, funded by the European Commission, the concept of a data pipeline was developed and put to practice in various international trade lanes comprising four continents in total. Within the Netherlands, the national initiative to support innovations in logistics (Topsector Logistics) yielded the development of a Neutral Logistics Information Platform (NLIP, see www. nlip. org). This platform aimed to support information exchange in international supply chains. Similar to ESW, the starting point in the NLIP were the Port Community Systems (PCSs) in main ports in the Netherlands, and build from there. Given the similarities, ESW has been heavily impacted by the development of NLIP and much of the material in this report is {{in the context of the}} NLIP concept and programme. However, be it a data pipeline, an Extended single window, or a logistics information platform, one of the pressing issues of these ICTs for information exchange in the international supply chain is the issue of governance. Governance primarily concerns what kind of decision structures are needed, for example on the process of agreeing on data ownership, the selection of standards, and the funding structures. What incentives can be created to have parties adopt it, and who should provide these incentives? Is value added functionality an option? If so, what kind of functionality; only for parties that agree to it and have a role in it, or can it actually be part of the funding structure? That makes the question for data ownership, and cost- and benefit distribution even greater. There are several configuration options for global information sharing ’system-of-systems’. For example, commercial platform providers could each offer commercial solutions, the adoption of which would benefit the supply chains using it because all of the platforms adhere to a similar standard for supporting compliance (Bharosa, Klievink, Janssen, & Tan, n. d.). Apart from the commercial platforms of global IT solution providers, one of the most realistic developments paths is to have national platforms as main hubs, or ‘landing places’, connecting the complex logistical processes and stakeholder setting of port environments to the international trade flows, information-wise that is. In this report, we analyse the route towards a national information platform. To ensure our analysis is rooted in empirical material, as a case study we picked a specific Port Community System (PCS) as one of the building blocks of the national information platform. The case study comprises three parts, of which the key findings are:  As the NLIP/ESW is all about value-added functionalities for the sector as a whole by making smart combinations of data, we study three value-added services of the PCS. These three services (cargo information, inland manifest and <b>discrepancy</b> <b>list)</b> illustrate the role of a community system in bringing together a multitude of parties that are all independent but come together in specific trade lanes where the actions and information of one affect those of others.  We analyse the role of the system in an export process. We find that this is largely community functionality that is needed for (the parties in) a port to efficiently operate in a competitive international environment. Our analysis shows how this kind of core functionality generates a steady stream of key data, both public and private, that is necessary to make the above-mentioned value-added service possible. These are often public-private combinations, with often one of more stakeholders that (more) directly benefit from these functionalities, but do require others to contribute (that benefit less or not). A major area for decision making that follows from this analysis is that for a NLIP/ESW, decisions need to be made on which functionalities are permissible and which data may be used for them (i. e. can data that have been provided for community functionality be re-used for value-added services?). This is also related to the issue of data ownership and any rights or permissions a custodian of data may have.  Third, we analyse the role of the system in an import process. Again, this is core functionality, needed by parties involved in importing goods, whether they are involved in the logistics (handling in the port and hinterland transport), the trade lane (e. g. as a buyer or re-seller of the goods), or as an inspection agency (e. g. Customs, food and product safety). In this situation, the ‘cargo information’ service (described as part of step one) offers functionality for various parties involved. However, our analysis shows that this also yields a debate on the pricing of such a service, as well as the cost distribution. A major area for decision making that follows from this, is that of decisions on the finance structure of the system as a whole (e. g. which services are considered community functionality and how to fund that) and of individual services that need to be decided on at the community-level (e. g. how are costs and/or benefits distributed among parties that are involved in the service). From the interviews we learn that stakeholders have multiple perspectives regarding the decisions at the community system level. Though NLIP/ESW is basically a federated system, the abovementioned aspects and areas for decision making transcend the level that individual actors can make decisions on. As NLIP/ESW brings multiple communities (e. g. the community in a specific port or in a specific sector) together, these areas also transcend the level of communities that have existing collaborations at the community level. Dealing with these aspects requires processes or structures for collaboration among stakeholders for agenda setting and decision-making. We argue that this situation can be dealt with by developing a structure (e. g. an institutionalised process, potentially with stakeholder participation) for deciding on these issues in a way that makes the decisions and the process transparent to the stakeholders. Also, the structure needs to accommodate that stakeholders can raise issues, are heard, and committed to the outcomes. This actor-related complexity is the area of governance of NLIP/ESW, the topic of work package 3 in the ESW project, of which this is the final report. When assessing the current governance related to NLIP/ESW, it becomes clear that currently much of the actor-complexity is funnelled on the technical complexity. In other words; the technical arrangement have to accommodate not only the technical complexity but also the positions and interests of the stakeholders that were involved in the development phase. Further adding to the complexity is that the types of operations and information exchanges that the NLIP/ESW should support are highly diverse, if it were to act as a national platform and pipeline ‘landing place’. This complexity cannot only be dealt with by technical solutions, further emphasising the need for solutions in the area of governance. Currently, many governance-related issues are discussed and decided on in a temporary collaboration structure (ESW is a project and NLIP could also be considered a project, or a programme covering multiple projects). Some issues that stakeholders encounter may seem operational or technical problems, but at the core these revolve around deciding what NLIP/ESW may do, aims to do, how it does that, and who pays for what. Our study finds that for the next step in the development of NLIP/ESW, a long-term basis for proper decision-making needs to be developed, also internationally. This basis entails that there be a structure and decision making processes that are able to ensure effective and efficient decision making regarding those aspects that transcend the level of individual actors (Veeneman, Ten Heuvelhof, De Bruijn, & Saanen, 2011). Parts of this structure are already in place in the existing NLIP/ESW programme, but its temporary ‘project’ basis is likely to be too permissive to be able to make decisions without risking a long, dragging process of strategic behaviour and negotiations. Also, the governance structures of the existing NLIP/ESW components (i. e. the PCSs) do work with representation of various stakeholder communities, but our research suggests that parties that are not involved directly (including parties that have representation) do not have a clear understanding of how decisions were made...|$|E

Librarians generally regard these lists as authoritative. OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical medicine journals on both peer-reviewed lists, measure the extent of discrepancies between these two lists, and determine the cause for these discrepancies. DESIGN: Comparison study. MEASUREMENTS: The extent of the discrepancies were tallied once the author had attempted to control for all extraneous variables. Interviews with the editorial staffs of each directory in regard to procedures for compiling the directories did not produce an explanation for these discrepancies. RESULTS: Nearly half (46 %) of the 784 clinical medicine journals were unique to either one directory's list of peer-reviewed journals or the other's, indicating significant discrepancies between the two directories. Specifically, The Serials Directory listed 211 (27 %) unique titles and Ulrich's International Periodicals Directory listed 150 (19 %) unique titles (total unique titles = 46 %).

The target for analysis is basic nursing training guidance of instructor myself. In basic nursing care training in clinical settings, situations in which guidance is thought to be necessary were reconstructed and used as research materials. From the research materials the characteristics of instructor awareness and expression were derived from the speech and behavior of the patientsand students focused on by the instructor 2 ̆ 7 s awareness and the instructor 2 ̆ 7 s expression. Furthermore, the characteristics of the guidance process were highlighted upon the derivation of the meaning of basic training guidance such as what sort of guidance the students were given in the chosen situations. In instructor awareness when guidance is deemed necessary in each situation, it became clear that there were common factors such as the perception of discrepancies in the instructor 2 ̆ 7 s and student 2 ̆ 7 s image of patients and their description of it. These <b>discrepancies</b> are <b>listed</b> as follows. 1. It is perceived that instructor consciousness is aimed at patients while student consciousness is aimed at themselves. 2. It is perceived that instructor is linking patient reality, awareness, and social aspects, the passage of time and environmental conditions while students perceive these patient aspects in a fragmentary manner. 3. It is perceived that instructor describes a target feature and perceive the meaning of a phenomenon while students perceive the meaning of a phenomenon in their own fashion. Whenever guidance is deemed necessary, the discrepancies are seen in instructor awareness from guidance process characteristics. These discrepancies, the learning stage and skill of the nursing process development will be generalized toelements of an instructor awareness structure. 本研究の目的は,基礎看護実習において,指導が必要と判断するときの指導者の認識を明らかにし,指導者の認識の構造についての示唆を得ることである。分析対象は,自己の基礎看護実習指導である。基礎看護実習において,指導が必要と思いかかわった場面を再構成し,研究素材とした。研究素材の中から指導者が注目した患者・学生の言動,指導者の認識,指導者の表現から,指導者の認識と表現の特徴を導き出した。さらに,選択された場面は学生にとってどのような指導をうけた場面であったといえるのか,基礎実習指導上の意味を導き出した上で,指導過程の特徴を導き出した。各場面において指導が必要と判断するとき,指導者は,学生との間に意識が向かう先と患者像と患者像の描き方のいずれかの不一致を認識しているという共通性が明らかになった。不一致の内容を以下に示す。 1. 指導者は,患者に意識を向け,学生は自分自身に意識が向いている,ととらえている 2. 指導者は,患者の実体面,認識面,社会面,時の流れ,環境条件をつなげており,学生は患者の部分を断片的にとらえている,ととらえている 3. 指導者は,対象特性を描いて現象の意味をとらえ,学生は自己流に現象の意味をとらえている,ととらえている 指導が必要と判断するとき,指導者には学生との不一致が認識されており,これら不一致が学生の学習段階と,看護過程展開の技術の修得状況とともに指導者の認識の構造を構成する要素に概念化されることが示唆された...|$|R

Methods: A non-invasive field microphone in the real ear (F-MIRE) -based method has been developed for measuring the {{effectiveness of}} different HPDs as a function of time in the work-place. Details of the test procedures, the equipment used, and the post-processing operations are presented and discussed. The methodology was developed {{in such a way that}} a complete time and frequency representation are possible. The system was used on a total of 24 workers in eight different companies. Work shifts of up to 9 -h long were recorded. Various types of ear-muffs and one type of molded earplugs were tested. Results: Attenuation data reported as a function of time showed, for most workers tested, considerable fluctuations over entire work shift periods. Parts of these fluctuations are attrib...|$|R
50|$|Controversy {{over the}} election's outcome {{continued}} after the certification {{of the hand}} recount results. The Washington State Republican Party called into question the <b>discrepancy</b> between the <b>list</b> of voters casting ballots in King County (895,660) {{and the number of}} ballots reported in the final hand recount (899,199). They claimed that hundreds of votes, including votes by felons, deceased voters, and double voters, were included in the canvass. As an explanation, election officials claimed that they had yet to finalize the list at the time, and argued that discrepancies in the two numbers are common and do not necessarily indicate fraud. As the election officials had expected, once the two lists were completed on January 5, the two numbers were indeed very close to one another. Also on January 5, 2005, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer published an article investigating votes in King County apparently cast by dead people. The PI uncovered eight cases of votes attributed to dead people; these included one administrative error, two ballots cast by the spouses of recently deceased voters (one who voted against Gregoire), one case of a husband apparently voting his dead wife's ballot instead of his own, and a man who legally voted his absentee ballot and then died before election day. One dead woman was marked as having voted in person at the polls.|$|R
40|$|Interpretation of {{pulmonary}} radiographs {{is one of}} {{the most}} difficult aspects of radiology and interobserver variability is high. The aim of this study was to assess variations in interpretation of pulmonary pathology amongst Brazilian veterinarians with different levels of training and experience, using the interpretation by American board-certified radiologists as a reference. We identified areas where interpretation is particularly challenging. Sixty digital canine thoracic radiographic examinations were interpreted by four groups of three Brazilian observers, each group being defined by different levels of training and experience. The radiographic findings of the 4 groups of observers in the study were compared to a reference interpretation established from the findings of three ACVR board-certified radiologists. The degree of <b>discrepancy</b> for each <b>list</b> between each group and the reference interpretation was assessed according to a three-level scoring system: no discrepancy, minor discrepancy, or major discrepancy. Data was analyzed using a Kappa and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests. Brazilian veterinarians with the most training and experience showed the least interobserver variation and best performance when compared to the reference interpretation, followed by those with practical training, but with little work experience in professional practice. The radiographic patterns that were associated with the highest interobserver variability were the vascular, unstructured interstitial and bronchial patterns. Interobserver major discrepancies occurred in all groups, but is more evident in groups with the least training (44. 4...|$|R
40|$|Can {{the use of}} {{electronic}} journal systems replace human intervention by the medicine reconciliation process? By André Luong Keywords: Medicine/medication reconciliation, electronic journal systems/records, pharmacist service, medication discrepancies, care transition Background: The introduction of the national electronic journal systems is considered a solution to provide effective and correct up to date medication information for healthcare professionals and contribute to minimize the potential of error. Medicine Reconciliation (MR) {{is the process of}} obtaining and maintaining and accurate, detailed list of all medicines taken by a patient and using this list anywhere within the health care system to ensure that the patient receives correct medicines. This thesis aimed to determine whether the electronic records provide a sufficient accurate patient medication record to negate the need for human mediated MR. Method: MR were conducted on patients at a Cardiologic bed ward from October 2015 until January 2016. MR were conducted by the IMM- method and documented medicine <b>lists</b> and <b>discrepancies</b> found between the hospital journal, electronic journals and a patient medication history interview. An expert panel consisting of two senior doctors and two pharmacists were asked to score the severity of the discrepancies using a validated scale. Results: 36 patients were included in the study where the study population had a mean (SD) age of 69. 8 (9. 7) and 36. 1 % were female. The mean (SD) number of drugs the patients used were 6. 97 (3. 03). In this study, discrepancies were found in 72, 2 % for both the hospital journal and electronic journal systems. 30 (83, 3 %) of the patients had at least one discrepancy in either the hospital journal or electronic journal systems. For the hospital journals the mean number of <b>discrepancies</b> per <b>list</b> were 2, 58, and 2, 73 for the electronic journal systems. Conclusion: There was no evidence of the impact {{of electronic}} journal systems on the medicine lists to negate the need for human intervention, and the existing process of care transition communication at the healthcare interface is not optimum. Evidence to support the MR intervention and IMM method is needed to conclude on the benefit of the service...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In the phytosociological literature, {{there are}} {{numerous}} different approaches to the designation of diagnostic species. Frequently, this results in <b>discrepancies</b> between the <b>lists</b> of diagnostic species published for {{one and the same}} community. We examined different approaches to determining diagnostic species using as an example Picea abies forests within the broader context of all Central European forests. Diagnostic species of spruce forests were determined from a data set of 20, 164 phytosociological relevØs of forests from the Eastern Alps, Western Carpathians, and the Bohemian Massif, which included 3, 569 relevØs of spruce forests. Phi coefficient of association was used to measure species fidelity, and species with the highest fidelities were considered as diagnostic. Diagnostic species were determined in four ways, including (A) comparison of spruce forests among the three mountain ranges, (B) comparison between spruce forests and other forests, performed separately in each of the mountain ranges, (C) simultaneous comparison of spruce forests of each of the mountain ranges with spruce forests of the other two ranges and with the other forests of all ranges, (D) comparison of spruce forests with the other forests, using pooled data sets from the three mountain ranges. The sets of diagnostic species of spruce forests yielded in comparisons A and B were sharply different; the set resulting from comparison C was intermediate between the first two and comparison D resulted in similar diagnostic species as comparison B. In comparison A, spruce forests of the Eastern Alps had a number o...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the principal determinants that are longitudinally associated with the performance of social roles in the first 3 years following a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Design: Inception cohort with 5 measurements over 3 years. Patients: A total of 156 patients recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Method: Performance of social roles was measured using the 2 role functioning and the social sub-scales of the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36. Potential determinants (n = 43) were divided into the following clusters: patient and disease characteristics (n = 12), psychosocial characteristics (n= 10), basic functions (n= 18) and basic activities (n= 3). Multivariate longitudinal regression analyses were performed with generalized estimating equations. A backwards selection procedure for every cluster per outcome reduced the large number of potential determinants. In order to determine whether longitudinal associations are present the selected determinants were entered into an overall regression model. Results: Twenty-three candidate determinants were selected. Vitality, measured with the SF 36 sub-scale vitality, the T 2 -weighted supratentorial lesion load and the perceived amount of social support, measured with the Social Support <b>List</b> <b>Discrepancies,</b> were longitudinally associated with the performance of social roles in 2 or 3 of the models. Conclusion: Vitality, the perceived amount of social support, and disease activity, i. e. the T 2 -weighted supratentorial lesion load, determine the performance of social roles in the early stages of multiple sclerosis. © 2007 The Authors.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether there were discrepancies between what medications frail elderly outpatients took and what physicians thought they took and whether discrepancies put patients at risk of taking inappropriate drugs and of increasing the potential for drug interactions. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Day Hospital Program at St Mary's of the Lake Hospital in Kingston, Ont. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty community-living elderly patients attending the Day Hospital Program in 1998. Three patients and two family physicians declined to participate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lists of medications being taken by patients compared with lists of medications in physicians' charts. Category according to explicit criteria that each drug fell into and risk of drug interactions {{as determined by the}} Clinidata Drug Interaction Program. RESULTS: Of the 120 patients, 115 had at least one <b>discrepancy</b> between their <b>lists</b> of medications and their physicians' lists. Of the 1390 medications on the lists, 521 (37 %) were being taken by patients without their doctors' knowledge, 82 (6 %) were not being taken by patients when doctors thought they were, and 133 (10 %) were on both patients' and their doctors' lists but with dosages or frequency of administration that were different. More potential drug interactions were identified on patients' lists than on physicians' lists. No increase in risk of inappropriate drug use was identified. CONCLUSION: Family physicians are often unaware of all the medications their patients are actually taking. Medications used by patients without physicians' knowledge increase the likelihood of drug interactions. Family physicians should look at and inquire about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, their patients are actually taking...|$|R
40|$|On {{material}} of 6 most significant Stories of Temporary Years lists {{the analysis of}} discrepancies of genetically correlative lexemes breg and bereg is carried out and protected {{for the purpose of}} definition of the main directions of their use in the lists differing with the place (the northeast, the West, the southwest and the South of Ancient Russia) and time (the 1417 th centuries) of the creation. In all lists dependence of the choice of the correlate defined by origin on thematic features of the text is permanently urgent. At the same time not pleophonic lexeme брегъ without changes remains in contexts of bookSlavic type of language, and the Russicism берегъ is presented in the steady phrases formulas and texts connected with a statement of the events having this or that relation to Novgorod which are characterized by stability of signs East Slavic by origin in all <b>lists.</b> <b>Discrepancies</b> in the use of lexemes breg / bereg are noted first of all in the texts borrowed from other sources and also as a part of prepositional and case designs on брегъ and отъ coast. The analysis of specifics of discrepancies allows to reveal the directions in selection of pleophonic and not pleophonic correlates depending on editorial editing, an orientation of lists and time of their emergence. The research has shown that Old Russian scribes keep the standardized cases of the use of not pleophonic and pleophonic lexemes and consequently also equivalence of their literary status up to the 16 th century. However and in more pozdnik lists when the tendency to primary use of not pleophonic correlate amplifies a little, initially developed genetically non-uniform background of the annalistic text remains...|$|R
