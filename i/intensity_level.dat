5|$|Male {{cocks-of-the-rock}} are polygamous, {{and have}} nothing to do with nesting once mating is done. The male’s energy instead is devoted to very elaborate display rituals that show off its magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where males gather to challenge rivals and beckon the females. The males are easily disturbed, so their behavior is not easy to see. One study reported that the display activity is dependent on light intensity, with the morning display period occurring during the same light <b>intensity</b> <b>level</b> as the afternoon period.|$|E

Intensity VI (Strong) effects were limited to a narrow coastal zone that included Myers Flat in the south and Brookings, Oregon in the north. Damage at this <b>intensity</b> <b>level</b> included broken plate glass windows, cracked walls, foundation and chimney damage, and significant loss of merchandise. In Fields Landing, two homes that came off their foundations, the fallen overpass, and broken gas, water, and sewer lines were associated with intensity VII (Very strong) shaking.|$|E

It was also listed as having been felt (with no specific <b>intensity</b> <b>level</b> given) by residents in high-rise buildings in Reno, Nevada. Closer to the epicenter, several instances of damage were aligned with the highest observed intensity. The structural effects to the gas station's walls and roof at Casa de Fruta, the beam damage {{on the second floor of}} the Ford's department store in Gilroy, and the caved-in roof from the fallen parapet at the law office in Hollister were all considered by the United States Geological Survey to be consistent with intensity VII (Very strong) shaking.|$|E

Therefore, we hypothesize that there will be differences in the electroglottogram-based voice economy parameter quasi-output cost ratio (QOCR) between actresses and nonactresses. This difference should remain across different <b>levels</b> of <b>intensity.</b> Methods. A total of 30 actresses and 30 nonactresses were recruited for this study. Participants from both groups were required to sustain the vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/, in habitual, moderate, and high <b>intensity</b> <b>levels.</b> Acoustic variables such as sound pressure level (SPL), fundamental frequency (F 0), and glottal contact quotient (CQ) were obtained. The QOCR was then calculated. Results. There were no significant differences among the groups for QOCR. Positive correlations were observed for QOCR versus SPL and QOCR versus F 0 in all <b>intensity</b> <b>levels.</b> Negative correlation was found between QOCR and CQ in all <b>intensity</b> <b>levels.</b> Considering the differences among <b>intensity</b> <b>levels,</b> from habitual to moderate and from moderate to loud, only the CQ did not differ significantly. The QOCR, SPL, and F 0 presented significant differences throughout the different <b>intensity</b> <b>levels.</b> Conclusion. The QOCR did not reflect the level of vocal training when comparing trained and nontrained female subjects in the present study. Both groups demonstrated more vocal economy in moderate and high <b>intensity</b> <b>levels</b> owing to more voice output without an increase in glottal adduction...|$|R

In North America, ECE R48 does not apply and while lens cleaners and beam levelers are permitted, they are not required; HID headlamps are markedly less prevalent in the US, where they have produced significant glare complaints.

40|$|Error-diffusion {{is widely}} used to {{generate}} <b>intensity</b> <b>levels</b> between the primary levels of multi-level colour printing devices (ink-jet printers, electrophotographic printers). Standard error-diffusion algorithms produce structure artifacts at rational <b>intensity</b> <b>levels</b> such as 1 / 3, 1 / 2 and 2 / 3. The boundary between structure artifacts breaks the visual continuity in regions of low intensity gradients and generates undesirable false contours. These undesirable structure artifacts are also visible when error-diffusion is used to generate intermediate <b>intensity</b> <b>levels</b> between primary levels. In this contribution, we propose to remove these structure artifacts by introducing small discontinuities in the tone correction curve, thereby avoiding reproducing the <b>intensity</b> <b>levels</b> responsible for the generation of structure artifacts. The method can not be applied to bilevel printing, since the forbidden intensity regions responsible for the structure artifacts would be too large. In multi-level colour printing however, the forbidden intensity regions are small enough and do not produce any visible intensity breaks in varying intensity wedges...|$|R

MÉTODOS: Estudo {{transversal}} com 12 adultos com limiares audiométricos PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} latencies and amplitudes of wave V on the Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potential (BAEP) recording obtained with click and CE-chirp® stimuli {{and the presence}} or absence of waves I, III and V in high intensities. METHODS: Cross-sectional study with 12 adults with audiometric thresholds < 15 dBHL (24 ears) and mean age of 27 years. The parameters used for the recording with both stimuli in intensities of 80, 60, 40, 20 dBnHL were alternate polarity and repetition rate of 27. 1 Hz. RESULTS: The CE-chirp® latencies for wave V were longer than click latencies at low <b>intensity</b> <b>levels</b> (20 and 40 dBnHL). At high <b>intensity</b> <b>levels</b> (60 and 80 dBnHL), the opposite occurred. Larger wave V amplitudes were observed with CE-chirp® in all <b>intensity</b> <b>levels,</b> except at 80 dBnHL. CONCLUSION: The CE-chirp® showed shorter latencies than those observed with clicks at high <b>intensity</b> <b>levels</b> and larger amplitudes at all <b>intensity</b> <b>levels,</b> except at 80 dBnHL.

Two groups of swimming training (continuous, CT, n = 7, and periodized training, PET, n = 7) rats were evaluated during 5 weeks in eight different TP (TP- 1 to TP- 8) through the analysis of the [La] response. The third group was the sedentary control (SC, n = 9). The TP were classified in five <b>intensity</b> <b>levels,</b> three aerobic (A- 1, A- 2, A- 3) and two anaerobic (AN- 1, AN- 2). Analysis of variance (ANOVA one-way, P< 0. 05) indicated significant differences in the [La] among the TP and among the five <b>intensity</b> <b>levels.</b> All TP of the A- 2 and A- 3 <b>intensity</b> <b>levels</b> differed from the A- 1 and AN- 1. The A- 1 and AN- 1 also differed among them.

In 66.4% of the cases, subjects shared the episode again to some third person. [...] Furthermore, subjects who reported higher emotional intensity in response to hearing the emotional story shared their experience and the story more often after the situation. This suggested that the frequency of sharing grows in relation to the intensity of the emotions felt when listening. In a second study, Christophe et Rimé proposed to subjects to recall an emotional experience according to an <b>intensity</b> <b>level</b> given (low, moderate, high). In this study, when emotional intensity was rated higher, more secondary social sharing occurred (79% of the cases).

2500|$|Loudness is {{perceived}} as how [...] "loud" [...] or [...] "soft" [...] a sound is and relates to the totalled number of auditory nerve stimulations over short cyclic time periods, most likely over the duration of theta wave cycles. This means that at short durations, a very short sound can sound softer than a longer sound {{even though they are}} presented at the same <b>intensity</b> <b>level.</b> Past around 200 ms this is no longer the case and the duration of the sound no longer affects the apparent loudness of the sound. Figure 3 gives an impression of how loudness information is summed over a period of about 200 ms before being sent to the auditory cortex. Louder signals create a greater 'push' on the Basilar membrane and thus stimulate more nerves, creating a stronger loudness signal. A more complex signal also creates more nerve firings and so sounds louder (for the same wave amplitude) than a simpler sound, such as a sine wave.|$|E
