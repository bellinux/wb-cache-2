5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that gender differences in attachment patterns of adaptive significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of <b>environmental</b> <b>risk</b> (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). <b>Environmental</b> <b>risk</b> can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless they are in a very high risk environment. Adrenarche is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganization of insecure attachment in middle childhood.|$|E

Race is thus partly a surrogate for environmental factors such as differences in socioeconomic status that are known to affect health.

This can give an approximation of probability for disease or for preferred treatment, although the approximation is less than perfect.|$|E
25|$|Several <b>environmental</b> <b>risk</b> {{factors have}} been {{proposed}} to {{support the hypothesis that}} the actual frequency of autism has increased.

There is overwhelming scientific evidence against the MMR hypothesis and no convincing evidence for the thiomersal (or Thimerosal) hypothesis, so these types of risk factors have to be ruled out. Although it is unknown whether autism's frequency has increased, any such increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics.|$|E
25|$|The Matanza-Riachuelo river (MR), a {{tributary}} of the Río de la Plata (La Plata River), is the most contaminated river basin in Argentina and {{considered one of the most}} polluted water bodies in the world. Pollution levels in Buenos Aires’ rivers are so high that they have been considered “open sewers”, making pollution the greatest <b>environmental</b> <b>risk</b> for the metropolitan area. Pollution levels have increased steadily as urbanization and industrial growth have continuously increased in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires. It is estimated that more than 4,000 industrial facilities are located in the lower and middle sections of the basin. Almost all of these industries discharge untreated effluents into the drainage system or directly into the MR River. In addition to high levels of organic pollution, these discharges contribute toxic contaminants such as heavy metals from petrochemical industries, tanneries, and meat processing facilities. More specifically, the Riacheuleo has levels of Lead, Zinc and Chrome 50 times higher than the legal limit in Argentina; 25% is from industrial sewage and waste, while the remaining 75% originates from domestic sources. The sudden onset of environmental and social degradation of the MR basin has resulted from limited investment in public infrastructure, poor environmental management, lack of adequate urban and industrial planning, and limited public infrastructure investment.|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} proposes and tests {{an explanation for}} the prior finding that temporal discounting is less pronounced for <b>environmental</b> <b>risks</b> than for other types of risks. We hypothesized that the controllability of the consequences brings about higher discount rates because people tend to believe that temporal delay will increase their amount of control, enabling them to avoid unwanted outcomes, thus lowering their risk judgments. The second step in our line of reasoning was that, if temporal discounting occurs for risks that are controllable, a lack of temporal discounting should be evident for <b>environmental</b> <b>risks</b> that remain uncontrollable despite outcome delays. We hypothesize that the lack of temporal discounting of <b>environmental</b> <b>risks</b> observed in previous studies is caused {{by the fact that the}} negative consequences of <b>environmental</b> <b>risks</b> are less controllable than risks in other domains. We predict that, due to the complex nature, the long delays involved and perceived uncertainty of <b>environmental</b> <b>risks</b> people perceive <b>environmental</b> <b>risks</b> as less controllable in comparison with health and monetary risks. We tested our hypotheses by conducting an experiment in which participants, 40 students at the University of Groningen, read brief descriptions of two environmental and two non-environmental risks. In these brief descriptions the temporal delay of the consequences and the controllability of the consequences were varied. After reading the descriptions the participants answered questions aimed to measure, the perceived delay, the perceived controllability, the seriousness, the acceptability and the imaginability of the negative consequences. Because the experimental manipulations failed to affect the participants’ risk judgments our hypotheses remain unsupported. We can not conclude that the perceived controllability of risks affect temporal discount rates and that risks that are considered uncontrollable will have lower discount rates than risks that are considered controllable. And the effect of the different scenarios on the perceived controllability of the participants contradicts our hypothesis that <b>environmental</b> <b>risks</b> are considered to be less controllable than other types of risks. Despite the lack of support for our hypotheses, we provide some recommendations for further research. ...|$|R
