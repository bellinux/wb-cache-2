5|$|Although ox-carts and chariots were {{previously}} used in China, the wheelbarrow {{was first used}} in Han China in the 1st century BC. Han artwork of horse-drawn chariots shows that the Warring-States-Era heavy wooden yoke placed around a horse's chest {{was replaced by the}} softer breast strap. Later, during the Northern Wei (386–534 AD), the <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> horse collar was invented.|$|E
5|$|By the 12th century Middle English was <b>fully</b> <b>developed,</b> {{integrating}} both Norse and Norman features; {{it continued}} to be spoken until the transition to early Modern English around 1500. Middle English literature includes Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, and Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. In the Middle English period the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated, and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as Chaucer.|$|E

5|$|For the {{original}} model, Holden replaced the long-serving Kingswood and Premier large executive cars developed in Australia, with another {{rear wheel drive}} (RWD) platform that was, however, based on a smaller European design by Opel, re-engineered for Australian conditions.

5|$|Immature {{birds are}} {{distinguished}} by their smaller size, smaller, duller-brown bill, dark grey chin and throat, and absent or underdeveloped head plumes, often just {{a scattering of}} yellow feathers.

5|$|In a wind farm, {{individual}} turbines are interconnected with {{a medium}} voltage (often 34.5 kV), {{power collection system}} and communications network. In general, a distance of 7D (7 × Rotor Diameter of the Wind Turbine) is set between each turbine in a <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> wind farm. At a substation, this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage electric power transmission system.|$|E

5|$|In hatching, mambas break {{though the}} egg shell with an egg tooth and {{are born with}} <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> venom glands; capable of inflicting a {{potentially}} lethal bite minutes after hatching. The body of the newly hatched snake contains the residues of the egg yolk, and assimilates them to sustain the young snake until it finds its first prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} LH matures {{the egg and}} weakens {{the wall of the}} {{follicle}} in the ovary, causing the <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> follicle to release its secondary oocyte. The secondary oocyte promptly matures into an ootid and then becomes a mature ovum. The mature ovum has a diameter of about 0.2mm.|$|E
5|$|A free {{jazz and}} {{contemporary}} classical work, Ten Freedom Summers comprises 19 pieces that are mostly <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> suites. They eschew conventional themes for abstract {{expressions of the}} subject matter, which focuses on the Civil Rights Movement and other interrelated topics. Smith cites the segregation of his native Mississippi and playwright August Wilson's The Pittsburgh Cycle as inspirations behind the work. Ten Freedom Summers received widespread critical acclaim and was named {{a finalist for the}} Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2013.|$|E

5|$|A {{juvenile}} {{often has}} a dark, brownish-grey nape that may look {{darker than the}} pale-edged black feathers. It has a dark grey to black head, neck, and upperparts, with white throat, cheeks, and underparts. During the first winter, the bill shape of the young {{may not be as}} <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> as that of the adult, and during the second winter, it much resembles the breeding adult, but with wing coverts lacking white spots.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{have the}} typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs {{on the food}} plant on which their larvae, known as {{caterpillars}}, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when <b>fully</b> <b>developed,</b> pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their whole life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Crickets are hemimetabolic insects, whose {{lifecycle}} {{consists of}} an egg stage, a larval or nymph stage that increasingly resembles the adult form as the nymph grows, and an adult stage. The egg hatches into a nymph {{about the size of}} a fruit fly. This passes through about 10 larval stages, and with each successive moult, it becomes more like an adult. After the final moult, the genitalia and wings are <b>fully</b> <b>developed,</b> but a period of maturation is needed before the cricket is ready to breed.|$|E

5|$|Eliminativists such as Paul and Patricia Churchland {{argue that}} folk {{psychology}} is a <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> but non-formalized theory of human behavior. It {{is used to}} explain and make predictions about human mental states and behavior. This view {{is often referred to}} as the theory of mind or just simply theory-theory, for it is a theory which theorizes the existence of an unacknowledged theory. As a theory in the scientific sense, eliminativists maintain, folk psychology needs to be evaluated on the basis of its predictive power and explanatory success as a research program for the investigation of the mind/brain.|$|E
5|$|Female moths are {{attracted}} to flowering soybean fields. The most severe infestations occur between flowering and when pods become <b>fully</b> <b>developed.</b> Large-scale outbreak is associated with time of peak flowering, when most pods are developed, and peak moth flight, for giant. Moths are also attracted to drought stressed soybeans or fields with poor growth. Dry weather leads to quick drying of corn plants, compelling moths to leave and seek other hosts. Heavy rainfall also decreases corn earworm populations because it drowns pupae in their soil chambers, limits moth flight, washes eggs from leaves, and creates favorable conditions for fungal diseases that kill caterpillars.|$|E

The game was released in Japan in February 2008, and has remained exclusive to the region. When released, it was critically acclaimed by both Japanese and Western journalists and sold strongly in Japan. Western journalists drew positive comparisons with the Mana and Diablo series.|$|E

5|$|Fulfordgate {{was located}} in the {{south-east}} of York, {{away from the city}} centre. It was a large distance from York railway station, while the tram service to Fulford only had one track, and the loop system for tramcars passing each other further restricted the service. During the ground's existence, bus routes had not been <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> and car ownership was not yet become common; it was not easy for the majority of supporters to reach.|$|E
5|$|In mammals, sexual {{differentiation}} {{is determined}} by the sperm that carries either an X or a Y (male) chromosome. The Y chromosome contains a sex-determining gene (SRY) that encodes a transcription factor for the protein tdf (testis determining factor) and triggers the creation of testosterone and Anti-Müllerian hormone for the embryo's development into a male. This differentiation begins about eight or nine weeks after conception. Some sources state that it continues until the twelfth week, while others state that it is clearly evident by the thirteenth week and that the sex organs are <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> by the sixteenth week.|$|E
5|$|Irenaeus' eschatology {{was based}} on a literal {{interpretation}} of the Bible, especially the Book of Revelation. He believed that there would be 6000 years of suffering before the world ends in a fiery purge. This fire would purify believers ahead of a new human community existing in the New Jerusalem. The afterlife, Irenaeus proposed, focuses more on time than space; he looked forward to a time in which humans are <b>fully</b> <b>developed</b> and live the life of God.|$|E
