500|$|The first {{breakaway}} of the {{day came}} from Jonathan Hivert (...) [...] He attacked alone and took both the mountains points and the victory at the first intermediate sprint. Despite at one point having a lead of nearly four minutes, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> was caught by the peloton. Michael Matthews (...) , in eighth place after the prologue, took {{second place in the}} intermediate sprint to win two bonus seconds, moving him to ten seconds behind Kwiatkowski, while John Degenkolb (...) took a second for finishing third.|$|E
60|$|Richard was {{suddenly}} tense. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> his foot {{reached for the}} self-starter.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and,</b> fixing {{abruptly}} {{his eyes}} on Babalatchi, tapped his own forehead significantly.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} {{threw himself into}} a chair. Suddenly <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> again, <b>and</b> {{addressed}} the Baroness.|$|R
60|$|With a groan {{the injured}} man {{turned on his}} side. Then <b>he</b> slowly <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> passed his wet hand over his face. Finally, he {{staggered}} to his feet.|$|R
60|$|Finding that {{he could}} not see us very well from where <b>he</b> <b>sat,</b> <b>he</b> got <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> threw one leg over {{the back of a chair}} and leaned upon it; thus having one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground.|$|R
60|$|Then came another growl or grunt, {{he could}} not tell which. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> looked outside.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} Starling. The latter hung {{his head and}} shook like a guilty schoolboy.|$|E
60|$|I {{went over}} to the faucet and drew him a glass. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> gulped it down.|$|E
6000|$|She {{took her}} {{faithful}} place beside him, fanning him and cooling his forehead; {{and he seemed}} to be falling asleep (always with the money in his hand), when <b>he</b> unexpectedly <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you suffering, father?" [...] I asked, almost fearfully. At {{the sound}} of my voice, <b>he</b> {{suddenly}} <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> there was a great fear in his eyes. Then he fell back again with a cry.|$|R
60|$|There {{was no more}} slumber for me that night, and {{in order}} to keep awake I sat bolt upright. This evidently did not please my companion, for {{presently}} <b>he</b> too <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> looked at me sharply.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> {{began to}} explain with mock solemnity how the detestable woman was set upon marrying him.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> {{with his}} {{incoherent}} words came the {{birth to her}} {{of a new and}} horrible suspicion.|$|E
60|$|Rowan {{pulled himself}} together. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> Deane, obeying a gesture from her, {{crossed the room}} once more.|$|E
60|$|Felix {{at first}} smiled; then {{he leaned back}} amongst the {{cushions}} and laughed outright. When he had ceased, he wiped the tears from his eyes. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> again <b>and</b> looked with admiration at the still, pale figure opposite to him.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, {{after being}} {{hit in the}} back of the neck on the basepaths with a thrown ball, Lowenstein was taken off the field on a stretcher. As he reached the dugout, <b>he</b> {{abruptly}} <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> pumped his fists to the crowd.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> stiffly <b>and</b> stared hard. The white {{figure was}} coming along the pathway through the corn. [...] "It's {{one of those}} niggers from the Fitzgibbon's," [...] said Bailey; [...] "or may I be hanged! I wonder why he keeps sawing with his arm." ...|$|R
60|$|The rye {{that was}} within the sack, however, hurt his head, and <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> opened the sack.|$|E
60|$|Deane {{was awakened}} by a light touch upon his arm. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> was aware of a girl bending over him.|$|E
60|$|For {{several minutes}} he {{remained}} quiet, trying {{to collect his}} thoughts. Then <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> passed one hand slowly over his forehead.|$|E
60|$|The sweet {{clearness}} of her child's {{voice was}} pleasant to him, {{and he wondered}} why he had never noticed it in children's voices before. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> slowly <b>and</b> stared at her. He felt {{that he ought to}} say something, but speech with him was a reluctant thing.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> at that, <b>and</b> {{held his}} head--by {{the look of}} him {{you could see it}} was spinning--and the blood poured on his pyjamas.|$|R
60|$|He rolled {{upon his}} face, {{shutting}} out the blue sky; his body stretched stiff as a bent spring released from its compress, and his nails dented {{the stock of}} his rifle. Then this rigidity softened to sobs that shook him from head to foot. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> haggard <b>and</b> wild-eyed.|$|R
60|$|Sam {{had been}} {{sleeping}} perhaps three hours, {{when he woke up}} with a slight start. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> tried to pierce the darkness around him.|$|E
60|$|Johnny Chuck {{opened his}} eyes. Then <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> rubbed them. For just a few, few minutes he couldn't {{remember}} {{where he was}} at all.|$|E
60|$|So <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> begged. He {{knew that}} Farmer Brown's boy {{knew what he}} wanted. But Farmer Brown's boy kept his hand just where it was.|$|E
60|$|My Lord the Seneschal moved. The {{noise of}} his slumbers {{culminated in a}} sudden, choking grunt, and {{abruptly}} ceased. His eyelids rolled slowly back, like an owl's, revealing pale blue eyes, which fixed themselves first upon the ceiling, then upon Anselme. Instantly <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> puffing <b>and</b> scowling, his hands shuffling his papers.|$|R
60|$|The other's {{paroxysm}} had passed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> weak <b>and</b> fainting, {{too weak}} to rise, his forehead dripping, his lips flecked with a foam made yellow by the mustard {{in which he had}} rolled. He rubbed his eyes with his knuckles, and groans that were like whines came from his throat.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, he took {{it pretty}} well; he was civil enough. Where are you, Loo?' <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in bed <b>and</b> kissed her. 'Good night, my dear, good night.' ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the fever}} {{was coming and}} by nightfall all of the others saw that Slavin was in a bad way. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> began to talk wildly.|$|E
60|$|Sabatini's {{attitude}} of indolence lasted only {{until they had}} turned from the waterway into the main river. Then <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> pointed a little way down the stream.|$|E
60|$|Just as I reached him, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> barked at me. I {{was never}} so taken aback in my life. I pulled up short {{and stared at}} him.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a little}} after midnight that Dick awoke with a cough. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in bed <b>and</b> opened his eyes to find the room almost filled with smoke.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hardy's {{expression}} of lofty scorn {{only served to}} retard his recovery, but <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> at last <b>and,</b> giving his eyes a final wipe, beamed kindly upon his victim.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I will do it,' {{replied the}} king; and he listened {{with all his}} might, till he judged that the white-faced horse was close to him. Then <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very {{straight}} <b>and</b> made ready.|$|R
