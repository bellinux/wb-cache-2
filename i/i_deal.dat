500|$|So {{this song}} is about me {{basically}} saying that just because {{all of those things}} are there [...] doesn't mean that there is not sort of the same person underneath. And then, also that these veils, they are really just protecting me from the thing that I held the most sacred, which is my creativity ... My Aura is the way that <b>I</b> <b>deal</b> with my insanity and I feel quite insane, so this song sounds very insane ... Everyone thinks that everything I do is a statement but some times I'm just moved by something passionate and I want to express it.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about a cold and emotionless man. In the first verse, Madonna enters in a medium range, 'You only see what your eyes want to see'. In the chorus, dance rhythm and ambient sounds are added. In the second verse, more visceral lyrics are added, like 'Love is a bird, she needs to fly'. During the bridge, a broad, string lines provide {{instrumental}} commentary on the lyrics. The song ends with a string ostinato that simply fades away, without fully resolving to the tonic chord. In an interview with The New York Times, Madonna commented that the lyrics to [...] "Frozen" [...] is built around [...] "Retaliation, revenge, hate, regret, that's what <b>I</b> <b>deal</b> with in [...] "Frozen". Everyone's going to say, 'That's a song about Carlos' , but it's not really; it's just about people in general".|$|E
500|$|... "No Surprises", {{recorded}} {{in a single}} take, is arranged with electric guitar (inspired by the Beach Boys' [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice"), acoustic guitar, glockenspiel and vocal harmonies. The band strove to replicate the mood of Louis Armstrong's 1968 recording of [...] "What a Wonderful World" [...] and the soul music of Marvin Gaye. Hoping to achieve a slower tempo than could be played well on their instruments, Godrich had the band record the song at a faster tempo, then slowed the playback for Yorke to overdub his vocals onto, creating an [...] "ethereal" [...] effect. Yorke identified {{the subject of the}} song as [...] "someone who's trying hard to keep it together but can't". The lyrics seem to portray a suicide or an unfulfilling life, and dissatisfaction with contemporary social and political order. Some lines refer to rural or suburban imagery. One of the key metaphors in the song is the opening line, [...] "a heart that's full up like a landfill"; according to Yorke, the song is a [...] "fucked-up nursery rhyme" [...] that [...] "stems from my unhealthy obsession {{of what to do with}} plastic boxes and plastic bottles... All this stuff is getting buried, the debris of our lives. It doesn't rot, it just stays there. That's how we deal, that's how <b>I</b> <b>deal</b> with stuff, I bury it." [...] The song's gentle mood contrasts sharply with its harsh lyrics; Steele said, [...] "even when the subject is suicide... O'Brien's guitar is as soothing as balm on a red-raw psyche, the song rendered like a bittersweet child's prayer." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{then said}} she was [...] "doing this to {{liberate}} America — free us all of our hang-ups". She told Spin magazine [...] "We live in a very repressed society, and <b>I</b> <b>deal</b> with erotic themes. The point I try to make is: Why should we feel ashamed of our sexuality?". Later she revealed that [...] " [...] does not condone unsafe sexual practices". Nicholas Callaway from Callaway Arts & Entertainment said that the book [...] was [...] "inevitably going to be controversial. The book explores every aspect of sexual fantasy. It's hard to calculate the effect, , Sex should be considered 'art'". Originally it was rumored that Time Warner was nervous about {{the release of the}} book; however, in an interview with Vanity Fair, William Sarnoff, president of Warner Books, said he felt that Madonna [...] "should pursue all avenues of creativity as she defines it". The Warner company had also previously assured that they would make sure Sex reached its main target audience and also reminded that the book was safely wrapped in a Mylar bag to prevent in-store peeping and contained a warning label. Michael Kilian of the Chicago Tribune published an article on October 7, 1992, regarding the then upcoming release of Sex: [...] "Prepare thyself, , The mega-event of the millennium is to occur in precisely two weeks. It's an event far more mega than the November election, the collapse of communism or even the crowning of Leanza Cornett as the new Miss America." [...] Kilian also described it as the [...] "personal sexual fantasy picture book in all Christendom, then it goes far beyond all previous 'truly twisted' personal sexual fantasy picture books—perhaps beyond all imagining what such a book could be".|$|E
500|$|Nirvana {{ultimately}} chose Albini {{to record}} its third album. [...] Albini {{had a reputation}} as a principled and opinionated individual in the American independent music scene. [...] While there was speculation that the band chose Albini to record the album due to his underground credentials, Cobain told Request magazine in 1993, [...] "For the most part I wanted to work with him because he happened to produce two of my favorite records, which were Surfer Rosa [...] and Pod [...]" [...] Inspired by those albums, Cobain wanted to utilize Albini's technique of capturing the natural ambiance of a room via the usage and placement of several microphones, something previous Nirvana producers had been averse to trying. [...] Months before the trio had even approached Albini about the recording, rumors circulated that he was slated to record the album. [...] Albini sent a disclaimer to the British music press denying involvement, only to get a call from Nirvana's management a few days later about the project. [...] Although he considered the group to be [...] "R.E.M. with a fuzzbox" [...] and [...] "an unremarkable version of the Seattle sound", Albini told Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad he accepted because he felt sorry for the band members, whom he perceived to be [...] "the same sort of people as all the small-fry bands <b>I</b> <b>deal</b> with", at the mercy of their record company. [...] Before the start of recording sessions, the band sent Albini a tape of the demos it had made in Brazil. [...] In return, Albini sent Cobain a copy of the PJ Harvey album Rid of Me to give him an idea of the acoustics at the studio where they would record.|$|E

2500|$|Edith Grossman, {{who wrote}} and {{published}} a highly acclaimed English {{translation of the}} novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, {{on the verge of}} both tragedy and comedy at the same time. Grossman has stated:The question is that Quixote has multiple interpretations [...] and how do <b>I</b> <b>deal</b> with that in my translation. I'm going to answer your question by avoiding it [...] so when I first started reading the Quixote I thought it was the most tragic book in the world, and I would read it and weep [...] As I grew older [...] my skin grew thicker [...] and so when I was working on the translation I was actually sitting at my computer and laughing out loud. This is done [...] as Cervantes did it [...] by never letting the reader rest. You are never certain that you truly got it. Because as soon as you think you understand something, Cervantes introduces something that contradicts your premise.|$|E
