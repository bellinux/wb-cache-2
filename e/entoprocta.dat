25|$|The Lophotrochozoa, evolved within Protostomia, {{include two}} of the most {{successful}} animal phyla, the Mollusca and Annelida. The former, which is the second-largest animal phylum by number of described species, includes animals such as snails, clams, and squids, and the latter comprises the segmented worms, such as earthworms and leeches. These two groups have long been considered close relatives because of the common presence of trochophore larvae, but the annelids were considered closer to the arthropods because they are both segmented. Now, this is generally considered convergent evolution, owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two phyla. Lophotrochozoa also includes the Nemertea or ribbon worms, the Sipuncula, and several phyla that have a ring of ciliated tentacles around the mouth, called a lophophore. These were traditionally grouped together as the lophophorates. but it now appears that the lophophorate group may be paraphyletic, with some closer to the nemerteans and some to the molluscs and annelids. They include the Brachiopoda or lamp shells, which are prominent in the fossil record, the <b>Entoprocta,</b> the Phoronida, and possibly the Bryozoa or moss animals.|$|E

5000|$|The phylum was {{originally}} called [...] "Polyzoa", but this name was soon replaced by Ehrenberg's term [...] "Bryozoa". The name [...] "Bryozoa" [...] {{was originally}} {{applied only to}} the animals also known as [...] "Ectoprocta", in which the anus lies outside the [...] "crown" [...] of tentacles (based on the Ancient Greek prefix ἐκτο meaning [...] "outside" [...] and word πρωκτος meaning [...] "anus"). After {{the discovery of the}} <b>Entoprocta,</b> in which the anus lies within a [...] "crown" [...] of tentacles (based on the Ancient Greek prefix ἐντο meaning [...] "inside" [...] and word πρωκτος meaning [...] "anus"), the name [...] "Bryozoa" [...] was used at phylum level to include the two classes Ectoprocta and <b>Entoprocta.</b> However, in 1869 Hinrich Nitsche regarded the two groups as quite distinct for a variety of reasons, and coined the name [...] "Ectoprocta" [...] for Ehrenberg's [...] "Bryozoa". Despite their apparently similar methods of feeding, they differed markedly anatomically; in addition to the different positions of the anus, ectoprocts have hollow tentacles and a coelom, while entoprocts have solid tentacles and no coelom. Hence the two groups are now widely regarded as separate phyla, and the name [...] "Bryozoa" [...] is now synonymous with [...] "Ectoprocta". This has remained the majority view ever since, although most publications have preferred the name [...] "Bryozoa" [...] rather than [...] "Ectoprocta". Nevertheless, some notable scientists have continued to regard the [...] "Ectoprocta" [...] and <b>Entoprocta</b> as close relatives and group them under [...] "Bryozoa".|$|E

50|$|Spiralia (commonly {{synonymous with}} lophotrochozoa) {{represent}} a diverse clade of animals whose species comprise {{the bulk of}} the bilaterian animals present today.

However, one unifying feature shared among spiralia is the pattern of cleavage in the early embryo known as spiral cleavage.|$|E
5000|$|The phylum was {{originally}} called [...] "Polyzoa", but this term was superseded by [...] "Bryozoa" [...] in 1831. Another {{group of animals}} discovered subsequently, whose filtering mechanism looked similar, was also included in [...] "Bryozoa" [...] until 1869, when {{the two groups were}} noted to be very different internally. The more recently discovered group was given the name <b>Entoprocta,</b> while the original [...] "Bryozoa" [...] were called [...] "Ectoprocta". However, [...] "Bryozoa" [...] has remained the more widely used term for the latter group.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} view is {{that the}} Bryozoa are a monophyletic group, in which the class Phylactolaemata is most closely related to Stenolaemata and Ctenostomata, the classes that appear earliest in the fossil record. However, in 2005 a molecular phylogeny study that focused on phylactolaemates concluded that these are more closely related to the phylum Phoronida, and especially to the only phoronid species that is colonial, than they are to the other ectoproct classes. That implies that the <b>Entoprocta</b> are not monophyletic, as the Phoronida are a sub-group of ectoprocts but the standard definition of <b>Entoprocta</b> excludes the Phoronida. In 2009 another molecular phylogeny study, using a combination of genes from mitochondria and the cell nucleus, concluded that Bryozoa is a monophyletic phylum, in other words includes all the descendants of a common ancestor that is itself a bryozoan. The analysis also concluded that the classes Phylactolaemata, Stenolaemata and Gymnolaemata are also monophyletic, but could not determine whether Stenolaemata are more closely related to Phylactolaemata or Gymnolaemata. The Gymnolaemata are traditionally divided into the soft-bodied Ctenostomata and mineralized Cheilostomata, but the 2009 analysis considered it more likely that neither of these orders is monophyletic and that mineralized skeletons probably evolved more than once within the early Gymnolaemata.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Entoprocta,</b> {{whose name}} means [...] "anus inside", is a phylum of mostly sessile aquatic animals, ranging from 0.1 to 7 mm long. Mature {{individuals}} are goblet-shaped, on relatively long stalks.

The superficially similar Bryozoa (Ectoprocta) have the anus outside a [...] "crown" [...] of hollow tentacles. Most families of entoprocts are colonial, and all but 2 of the 150 species are marine. A few solitary species can move slowly.|$|E

5000|$|When entoprocts were {{discovered}} in the nineteenth century, they and bryozoans (ectoprocts) were regarded as classes within the phylum Bryozoa, because both groups were sessile animals that filter-fed {{by means of a}} [...] "crown" [...] of tentacles that bore cilia.

[...] "Bryozoa" [...] then became just an alternative name for ectoprocts, in which the anus is outside the feeding organ. However, studies by one team in 2007 and 2008 argue for sinking <b>Entoprocta</b> into Bryozoa as a class, and resurrecting Ectoprocta as a name for the currently identified bryozoans.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The phylogenetic {{position}} of Bryozoa {{is one of}} the most controversial issues in metazoan phylogeny. In an attempt to address this issue, the first bryozoan mitochondrial genome from Flustrellidra hispida (Gymnolaemata, Ctenostomata) was recently sequenced and characterized. Unfortunately, it has extensive gene translocation and extremely reduced size. In addition, the phylogenies obtained from the result were conflicting, so they failed to assign a reliable phylogenetic position to Bryozoa or to clarify lophophorate phylogeny. Thus, it is necessary to characterize further mitochondrial genomes from slowly-evolving bryozoans to obtain a more credible lophophorate phylogeny. Results The complete mitochondrial genome (15, 433 bp) of Bugula neritina (Bryozoa, Gymnolaemata, Cheilostomata), one of the most widely distributed cheliostome bryozoans, is sequenced. This second bryozoan mitochondrial genome contains the set of 37 components generally observed in other metazoans, differing from that of F. hispida (Bryozoa, Gymnolaemata, Ctenostomata), which has only 36 components with loss of tRNA ser(ucn) genes. The B. neritina mitochondrial genome possesses 27 multiple noncoding regions. The gene order is more similar to those of the two remaining lophophorate phyla (Brachiopoda and Phoronida) and a chiton Katharina tunicate than to that of F. hispida. Phylogenetic analyses based on the nucleotide sequences or amino acid residues of 12 protein-coding genes showed consistently that, within the Lophotrochozoa, the monophyly of the bryozoan class Gymnolaemata (B. neritina and F. hispida) was strongly supported and the bryozoan clade was grouped with brachiopods. Echiura appeared as a subtaxon of Annelida, and <b>Entoprocta</b> as a sister taxon of Phoronida. The clade of Bryozoa + Brachiopoda was clustered with either the clade of Annelida-Echiura or that of Phoronida + <b>Entoprocta.</b> Conclusion This study presents the complete mitochondrial genome of a cheliostome bryozoan, B. neritina. The phylogenetic analyses suggest a close relationship between Bryozoa and Brachiopoda within the Lophotrochozoa. However, the sister group of Bryozoa + Brachiopoda is still ambiguous, although it has some attractions with Annelida-Echiura or Phoronida + <b>Entoprocta.</b> If the latter is a true phylogeny, lophophorate monophyly including <b>Entoprocta</b> is supported. Consequently, the present results imply that Brachiozoa (= Brachiopoda + Phoronida) and the recently-resurrected Bryozoa concept comprising Ectoprocta and <b>Entoprocta</b> may be refuted. </p...|$|E
