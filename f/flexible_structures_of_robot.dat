40|$|AbstractThis work {{introduces}} {{a new concept}} for designing and manufacturing an industrial robot by using modern production techniques and a 3 D modelling software. The most important requirements of this project were to build a customized, lightweight and low cost robot, capable to fulfil many industrial working tasks such as palletizing mobile telephone covers. For designing and optimizing the mechanical <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> the palletizing <b>robot</b> a SolidWorks- software was used. Integrating motion simulation tools in SolidWorks intensely reduces the engineering time for finding the optimal mechanical <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>robot</b> according to the industrial task. The robot parts are produced by using the additive manufacturing technology- powder material PA 2200. For solving the forward and inverse kinematics <b>of</b> the <b>robot,</b> the Software tool SimMechanics from MathWorks was used. This environment provided by the software enables building a human machine interface in order to store and program the robot targets.
