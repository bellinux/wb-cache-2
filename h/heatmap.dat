40|$|Pixel-level {{annotations}} {{are expensive}} and time-consuming to obtain. Hence, weak supervision using only image tags {{could have a}} significant impact in semantic segmentation. Recent years have seen great progress in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation, whether from a single image or from videos. However, most existing methods are designed to handle a single background class. In practical applications, such as autonomous navigation, it is often crucial to reason about multiple background classes. In this paper, we introduce an approach to doing so by making use of classifier <b>heatmaps.</b> We then develop a two-stream deep architecture that jointly leverages appearance and motion, and design a loss based on our <b>heatmaps</b> to train it. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of our classifier <b>heatmaps</b> and of our two-stream architecture on challenging urban scene datasets and on the YouTube-Objects benchmark, where we obtain state-of-the-art results.

40|$|Background In {{cognitive}} neuroscience {{the potential of}} deep neural networks (DNNs) for solving complex classification tasks {{is yet to be}} fully exploited. The most limiting factor is that DNNs as notorious ‘black boxes’ do not provide insight into neurophysiological phenomena underlying a decision. Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) has been introduced as a novel method to explain individual network decisions. New method We propose the application of DNNs with LRP for the first time for EEG data analysis. Through LRP the single-trial DNN decisions are transformed into <b>heatmaps</b> indicating each data point's relevance for the outcome of the decision. Results DNN achieves classification accuracies comparable to those of CSP-LDA. In subjects with low performance subject-to-subject transfer of trained DNNs can improve the results. The single-trial LRP <b>heatmaps</b> reveal neurophysiologically plausible patterns, resembling CSP-derived scalp maps. Critically, while CSP patterns represent class-wise aggregated information, LRP <b>heatmaps</b> pinpoint neural patterns to single time points in single trials. Comparison with existing method(s) We compare the classification performance of DNNs to that of linear CSP-LDA on two data sets related to motor-imaginary BCI. Conclusion We have demonstrated that DNN is a powerful non-linear tool for EEG analysis. With LRP a new quality of high-resolution assessment of neural activity can be reached. LRP is a potential remedy for the lack of interpretability of DNNs that has limited their utility in neuroscientific applications. The extreme specificity of the LRP-derived <b>heatmaps</b> opens up new avenues for investigating neural activity underlying complex perception or decision-related processes...|$|R

30|$|While {{conducting}} an individual page analysis which correlated detection scores, {{time spent on}} each page, and cursor position <b>heatmaps,</b> we reported {{that many of the}} participants who failed to correctly identify only one page in our study had missed phishing attacks which relied on pop-ups.

Also, the study showed that the anchoring effect is present when detecting phishing. <b>Heatmaps</b> supported our hypothesis, thus suggesting that recent history has an impact on the ability of people to detect phishing web pages.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} on human pose {{estimation}} using Convolutional Neural Networks. Our main contribution is a CNN cascaded architecture {{specifically designed for}} learning part relationships and spatial context, and robustly inferring pose even for the case of severe part occlusions. To this end, we propose a detection-followed-by-regression CNN cascade. The first part of our cascade outputs part detection <b>heatmaps</b> {{and the second part}} performs regression on these <b>heatmaps.</b> The benefits of the proposed architecture are multi-fold: It guides the network where to focus in the image and effectively encodes part constraints and context. More importantly, it can effectively cope with occlusions because part detection <b>heatmaps</b> for occluded parts provide low confidence scores which subsequently guide the regression part of our network to rely on contextual information in order to predict the location of these parts. Additionally, we show that the proposed cascade is flexible enough to readily allow the integration of various CNN architectures for both detection and regression, including recent ones based on residual learning. Finally, we illustrate that our cascade achieves top performance on the MPII and LSP data sets. Code can be downloaded from [URL] accepted to ECCV 201...|$|R
