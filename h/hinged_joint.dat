Through {{experiment}} and theoretical analysis, this paper researched {{the influence of}} steel bar corrosion of hollow slab <b>hinge</b> <b>joints</b> on the structural mechanical behavior. The results showed that when load was little corrosion of <b>hinge</b> <b>joints</b> steel bar would do little to affect the joint between hollow slabs and <b>hinge</b> <b>joints</b> would work together with hollow slabs as a whole. When load was large, corrosion of <b>hinge</b> <b>joints</b> steel bar would decrease the joint between hollow slabs...|$|R

The designs of existing stretcher are single or double fold and heavy therefore difficult to carry. For the present war scenario, a strong need to design the multifold backpack Casualty Evacuation Stretcher is felt since it will be easy to carry use and store. To make the stretcher backpack, <b>hinge</b> <b>joint</b> is the most suitable method to meet the functional requirements. Various engineering considerations are required to design the <b>hinge</b> <b>joint</b> for the stretcher. The functional requirements of the <b>hinge</b> <b>joint</b> are worked out from the market survey conducted for stretcher. For the present work, an attempt is made to design the stretcher <b>hinge</b> <b>joint</b> by using Integrated Product Design Approach and tools like QFD (Quality Functions Deployment) and CAD.

5000|$|As putting {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of a player's golf game, a variety of teaching tools and trainers exist to assist the player in learning correct technique. Though many tools are simply simulations of a putting green such as indoor putting mats and cups, or attachments such as laser guides, some tools are integral features of a [...] "training club". One such tool is the breakaway; a <b>hinged</b> <b>joint</b> in the shaft of an otherwise normal putter that stays rigid until a certain amount of force is applied, then gives way. This is used to teach golfers to use a steady, even putting motion without any sudden pressure applied by the hands or arms to swing the club, creating a more relaxed, controllable putt. Another feature is a curved face, sometimes severely so. Though most putter faces are flat and, depending on other aspects of the head design, very forgiving, the curved putter face forces the player to contact the ball with the very center of the clubfeet in order to hit a straight shot. All other shots will carom off in odd directions or will curve off the intended putting line. Other training clubs incorporate very lightweight heads which encourage a firmer upper body posture that reduces wrist and arm movement, or to the opposite extreme a very heavyweight head that encourages the user to adopt the [...] "pendulum swing" [...] technique and use the weight of the club instead of muscle power. Almost all of these can be used as a [...] "real" [...] putter, but the idea of these devices is to make putting harder than with a real putter as the desired result only occurs when the player utilizes perfect technique, and therefore they are normally used only in practice environments.|$|E
