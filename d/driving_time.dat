5|$|Several {{private and}} public motor {{carriers}} such as Frito-Lay, United Parcel Service, and Werner Enterprises, have voluntarily implemented electronic on-board recorders to ensure drivers are {{in compliance with the}} federal regulations, to reduce the errors and hassles associated with paper log books, and to improve driver retention and recruitment. EOBRs automatically record the <b>driving</b> <b>time</b> and cannot be easily forged. Any violation of the HOS will automatically be recorded and reported to the company. The FMCSA is considering making EOBRs mandatory for all motor carriers.|$|E

5|$|Truck drivers {{spend up to}} 11hours a day driving, and up to 14hours a day {{engaged in}} various duties (including <b>driving</b> <b>time)</b> such as fueling, filling out paperwork, obtaining vehicle repairs, and {{conducting}} mandatory vehicle inspections. Long-haul drivers often spend weeks away from home, spending their time off and sleeping at truck stops or rest areas. Driving is relatively dangerous work, as truck drivers account for 12 percent and the highest total number of all work-related deaths, and are five {{times more likely to}} die on the job than the average worker. Smoking, lack of exercise, unhealthy eating habits, and work-related injuries also contribute to the driver's generally risk-prone lifestyle. A survey by the National Institutes of Health found 67 percent of long-haul drivers were smokers or had quit smoking.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the empirical hedonic prices for non-standard condominiums and single family houses using nonparametric estimates {{as well as}} a generalized additive model for the spatial generalization of the attractiveness of all Swiss communities. We find that the assumption of log-linearity for continuous variables does not hold but can be replaced by partwise log-linear or quadratic terms. Due to the topographical segmentation of Switzerland, <b>driving</b> <b>times</b> seem to be more adequate than geographical distances to explain the price level of a village with the price level of its neighbours. We show, that using metric multidimensional scaling, the <b>driving</b> <b>times</b> between the villages can be converted into artificial coordinates with three principal axis to serve as a basis for the prediction of the macro-locations of the Swiss villages.

5|$|From 1988, {{environmental}} groups started opposing the Triangle Link. The most active was the {{local chapter of}} the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, who stated that the road would have a negative impact for local boat traffic to the recreational islands of Føyno and Nautøy. They therefore recommended that the municipalities select a pontoon bridge. Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections to ensure that the municipal councils had backing in the public. Also Gisle Tjong, a local citizen, opposed the project, stating that the risk was too large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last. He argued that the tolls could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advance tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the saved-up funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was near consensus in favor of the project. The exception was in southern Bømlø, where there was concerns that their ferry service to the mainland would be terminated, which would result in considerably longer <b>driving</b> <b>time</b> to Haugesund. Concerns were also raised regarding people with fear of tunnels and proposals were made to keep a ferry service for such people.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, an NSB Class Cmb1 diesel {{multiple}} unit was taken into use, {{and the number of}} daily trips increased to four. On days with heavy traffic, it hauled a trailer, which was normally stationed at Sandnes Station. On 10 November 1935, the new Ganddal Station opened, simplifying the stopping at the station. During World War II, the {{multiple unit}}s were disused, and instead the trains were hauled with steam locomotives. From 1 May 1944, the line was converted to standard gauge, and NSB Class 14 multiple units were taken into use, running on wood gas {{until the end of the}} war. In 1945, there were four daily round trips, but at the start of 1946, the number of daily round trips increased to six, and from mid-1946, to ten. From 1947 to 1953, there were eight or nine daily round trips, and from 1953 ten. Class 14 was eventually replaced with NSB Class 86 and NSB Class 87 in 1953. By then, the <b>driving</b> <b>time</b> from Ålgård to Sandnes had been reduced from 38 to 25minutes.|$|E

25|$|The daily <b>driving</b> <b>time</b> {{shall not}} exceed 9 hours. The daily <b>driving</b> <b>time</b> may be {{extended}} to at most 10 hours not more than twice during the week. The weekly <b>driving</b> <b>time</b> may not exceed 56 hours. In addition to this, a driver cannot exceed 90 hours driving in a fortnight. Within each period of 24 hours {{after the end of}} the previous daily rest period or weekly rest period a driver must take a new daily rest period. An 11-hour (or more) daily rest is called a regular daily rest period. Alternatively, a driver can split a regular daily rest period into two periods. The first period must be at least 3 hours of uninterrupted rest and can be taken at any time during the day. The second must be at least 9 hours of uninterrupted rest, giving a total minimum rest of 12 hours. A driver may reduce his daily rest period to no less than 9 continuous hours, but this can be done no more than three times between any two weekly rest periods; no compensation for the reduction is required. A daily rest that is less than 11 hours but at least 9 hours long is called a reduced daily rest period. When a daily rest is taken, this may be taken in a vehicle, as long as it has suitable sleeping facilities and is stationary.|$|E

40|$|State {{and local}} governments {{invested}} 13 % of their revenues on infrastructure in 2002, but existing literature provides only mixed evidence that infrastructure contributes to economic activity. To estimate the effect of infrastructure on the economy, Chapter 1 analyzes how {{the construction of the}} Interstate Highway System (IHS) contributed to regional development in the United States by expanding intercity trade, using data on the construction of the IHS, intercity trade and regional economic activities. Empirical results provide evidence that the IHS reduced <b>driving</b> <b>times</b> among cities and subsequently increased inter-city trade in the following two ways. First, it increased the volume of trade among existing trading partners. Second, it increased the probability of trade among cities that previously did not trade. Moreover, trade expanded more for nationally traded goods more than for locally traded goods, because the former relied more on the IHS than the latter. By expanding trade, the IHS increased regional output, employment and firm entry. Existing literature provides mixed evidence on whether infrastructure contributes to economic growth, because of a problem of reverse causality [...] better infrastructure may not lead to higher growth, but regions with higher growth may invest more in infrastructure. Chapter 2 uses an instrumental variable to identify the impact of the construction of infrastructure, focusing on the construction of the Interstate Highway System (IHS). A close link exists between the 1956 Interstate Highway (IH) plan and pre-existing economic prosperity. But both historical evidence and regression analysis show that construction priority among highway segments partly depended on {{how easy it was to}} build those segments; and ease of construction is plausibly exogenous to economic growth. We instrument the open-to-traffic time for each segment of highway using construction costs from the 1958 Interstate Cost Estimates. We apply the instrument to estimate the effect of new IH on <b>driving</b> <b>times,</b> and find that an OLS regression under-estimates the effect of IH on <b>driving</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R

40|$|Railway {{simulations}} {{have been}} a useful tool within the railway industry. One of the simulators that ProRail, the Dutch infrastructure manager for the railways, uses is the micro-railway simulator FRISO. ProRail wants {{to find out if}} the validity of this simulator could be improved through adding agent based train drivers. In this thesis the development of these agents will be described. Different data sources about train driver behaviour were available and could be used to create a train driver model that could be implemented within the designed agents. Using this, an agent DLL was written in C++ to work together with FRISO. Simulations were then done in order {{to find out if the}} validity had improved with the added agents. Through comparing the resulting <b>driving</b> <b>times</b> with the previous train driver implementation and realisation data, it was concluded that the agents scored better. When looking at the driving behaviour of the agents, it was concluded that this lied closer to the realisation data then that of the FRISO train drivers. It was also noted that certain aspects of train driver behaviour were not modelled correctly by the agents and/or FRISO which resulted in deviations seen in <b>driving</b> <b>times</b> and <b>driving</b> behaviour. The presence of these aspects indicated that a sufficiently accurate model of train driver behaviour is required if reliable simulation results are desired...|$|R
