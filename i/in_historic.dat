5|$|As many as 13 now-extinct {{species of}} macaw have {{variously}} been suggested {{to have lived}} on the Caribbean islands, {{but many of these}} were based on old descriptions or drawings and only represent hypothetical species. Only three endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains: the Cuban macaw, the Saint Croix macaw (Ara autochthones), which is known only from subfossils, and the Lesser Antillean macaw (Ara guadeloupensis), which is known from subfossils and reports. Macaws are known to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from mainland South America to the Caribbean both <b>in</b> <b>historic</b> times by Europeans and natives, and in prehistoric times by Paleoamericans. Historical records of macaws on these islands, therefore, may not have represented distinct, endemic species; {{it is also possible that}} they were escaped or feral foreign macaws that had been transported to the islands. All the endemic Caribbean macaws were likely driven to extinction by humans <b>in</b> <b>historic</b> and prehistoric times. The identity of these macaws is only likely to be further resolved through fossil finds and examination of contemporary reports and artwork.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, as part {{of urban}} renewal, the city razed about 200 {{buildings}} across 25 city blocks (roughly 40% of downtown), destroying the Gateway District and many buildings with notable architecture, including the Metropolitan Building. Efforts to save the building failed but are credited with sparking interest in (but not always succeeding <b>in)</b> <b>historic</b> preservation in the state.|$|E

5|$|The first {{records of}} Herm's {{inhabitants}} <b>in</b> <b>historic</b> times {{are from the}} 6th century, when the island became a centre of monastic activity; the followers of Saint Tugual (also called Tudwal) arrived, establishing Saint Tugual's Chapel. In 709, a storm washed away the strip of land which connected the island with Jethou.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasive}} species {{that causes the}} most damage to bird populations is the cat (Felis catus), both domestic and feral. Cats that are let outside live close to suburban populations and have been estimated to number 640per square mile.

5|$|As many as 13 now-extinct {{species of}} macaw have {{variously}} been suggested {{to have lived}} on the Caribbean islands, {{but many of these}} were based on old descriptions or drawings and only represent hypothetical species. In addition to the Lesser Antillean macaw, only two endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains; the Cuban macaw is known from 19 museum skins and subfossils, and the Saint Croix macaw (A. autochthones) is known only from subfossils. Macaws are known to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from mainland South America to the Caribbean both <b>in</b> <b>historic</b> times by Europeans and native peoples, and in prehistoric times by Paleoamericans. Parrots were important in the culture of native Caribbeans, and were among the gifts offered to Christopher Columbus when he reached the Bahamas in 1492. Historical records of macaws on these islands, therefore, may not have represented distinct, endemic species; {{it is also possible that}} these macaws were escaped or feral birds that had been transported to the islands from elsewhere. All the endemic Caribbean macaws were likely driven to extinction by humans <b>in</b> <b>historic</b> and prehistoric times. The identity and distribution of indigenous macaws in the Caribbean is only likely to be further resolved through paleontological discoveries and examination of contemporary reports and artwork.|$|E
5|$|Cheddar is {{recognised}} as a village. The adjacent {{settlement of}} Axbridge, although {{only about a}} third the population of Cheddar, is a town. This apparently illogical situation is explained by the relative importance of the two places <b>in</b> <b>historic</b> times. While Axbridge grew in importance as a centre for cloth manufacturing in the Tudor period and gained a charter from King John, Cheddar remained a more dispersed mining and dairy-farming village. Its population grew {{with the arrival of the}} railways in the Victorian era and the advent of tourism.|$|E
5|$|Macaws {{are known}} to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from {{mainland}} South America both <b>in</b> <b>historic</b> times by Europeans and natives, and prehistoric times by Paleoamericans. Parrots were important in the culture of native Caribbeans, were traded between islands, and were among the gifts offered to Christopher Columbus when he reached the Bahamas in 1492. It is therefore difficult to determine whether the numerous historical records of macaws on these islands refer to distinct, endemic species, since they could have been based on escaped individuals or feral populations of foreign macaws of known species that had been transported there. As many as thirteen extinct macaws have been suggested to have lived on the islands until recently. Only three endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains; the Cuban macaw (Ara tricolor) is known from nineteen museum skins and subfossils, the Saint Croix macaw (Ara autochthones) is only known from subfossils, and the Lesser Antillean macaw is known from subfossils and reports. No endemic Caribbean macaws remain today; they were likely driven to extinction by humans <b>in</b> <b>historic</b> and prehistoric times.|$|E

5|$|The fauna of Scotland is {{generally}} {{typical of the}} northwest European part of the Palearctic ecozone, although several of the country's larger mammals were hunted to extinction <b>in</b> <b>historic</b> times and human activity has also led to various species of wildlife being introduced. Scotland's diverse temperate environments support 62 species of wild mammals, including a population of wild cats, important numbers of grey and harbour seals and the most northerly colony of bottlenose dolphins in the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} (especially the sister species, Pinguinus alfrednewtoni) and {{molecular}} evidence {{show that the}} three closely related genera diverged soon after their common ancestor, a bird probably similar to a stout Xantus's murrelet, had spread to the coasts of the Atlantic. Apparently, by that time, the murres, or Atlantic guillemots, already had split from the other Atlantic alcids. Razorbill-like birds were common in the Atlantic during the Pliocene, but {{the evolution of the}} little auk is sparsely documented. The molecular data are compatible with either possibility, but the weight of evidence suggests placing the great auk in a distinct genus. Some ornithologists still believe it is more appropriate to retain the species in the genus Alca. It is the only recorded British bird made extinct <b>in</b> <b>historic</b> times.|$|E
5|$|The {{variation}} of plant susceptibility to pests was probably known {{even in the}} early stages of agriculture in humans. <b>In</b> <b>historic</b> times, the observation of such variations in susceptibility have provided solutions for major socio-economic problems. The grape phylloxera was introduced from North America to France in 1860 and in 25 years it destroyed nearly a third (100,000km²) of the French grape yards. Charles Valentine Riley noted that the American species Vitis labrusca was resistant to Phylloxera. Riley, with J. E. Planchon, helped save the French wine industry by suggesting the grafting of the susceptible but high quality grapes onto Vitis labrusca root stocks.|$|E

5|$|With the {{surrender}} of Ani to the Byzantine Empire in 1045 and the Byzantine annexation of Kars in 1064, the final independent Armenian state <b>in</b> <b>historic</b> Armenia, Bagratuni kingdom, came to an end. However, despite foreign domination of the region, which became more pronounced after the Seljuk Turks defeated the Byzantines {{at the battle of}} Manzikert in 1071, Armenians in eastern Armenia were able to maintain autonomy in the two mountainous kingdoms of Syunik and Lori and in the principality of Khachen. From the early to mid-12th century, the combined Georgian and Armenian armies were successful in pushing the Turks out of Eastern Armenia, thereby establishing a period of relative peace and prosperity until the appearance of the Mongols in 1236.|$|E
5|$|After the {{government}} of Nova Scotia established a lifesaving station on Sable Island in 1801, workers trained some of the horses to haul supplies and rescue equipment. Lifesaving staff recorded the importation of a stallion, Jolly, taken there in 1801, who was probably similar in type to the original Acadian horses released on the island. Although Jolly {{was not the first}} horse on the island, {{he was the first to}} be identified by name <b>in</b> <b>historic</b> records, and is known to have survived on the island until at least 1812. Other breeding stock, probably including horses of Thoroughbred, Morgan and Clydesdale breeding, were sent to the island during the first half of the 19th century, in the hopes of improving the type of horses found on the island and raising the price for which they could be sold on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Boise National Forest's 2010 forest plan {{recognizes that}} fire and other {{disturbances}} play {{important roles in}} maintaining the character and function of ecosystems. However, previous management strategies (as recently as the 1990 forest plan) treated fire as an undesirable process, and the Organic Act of 1897 explicitly stated that forests were {{to be protected from}} destruction by fire. <b>In</b> <b>historic</b> conditions fires naturally occurred on the landscape; the suppression of fires allowed dead trees to accumulate in excess of historic levels and land cover types to change, such as a shift to higher shrub and tree densities. An estimated 14 percent of the land in Boise National Forest has been affected by fires since the early 1990s, and about 10 percent of the land capable of timber production was burned so severely that land cover shifted from forest to grass and shrubland (as of 2010).|$|E

Once across to Greenport, NY114 ends quickly at NY25, again just a block or so from the heart of the village. Despite the short distance between the North Ferry terminal and the northern terminus, NY114 includes three streets in Greenport. Northbound Route114 runs on Third Street from the ferry terminal to NY25. Southbound NY114 runs along Fifth Street then one block later turns left onto Wiggins Street, where it heads eastbound until it passes the historic Greenport Railroad Station, and terminates at Third Street and the North Ferry terminal. The portion of NY114 within Greenport is maintained by the village.|$|E
