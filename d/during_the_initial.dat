5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> post-war period, a {{shortage}} of machinery, tools, and materials, {{as well as a}} dearth of new orders, hampered operations. Some salvage work occurred, as well as rubble-clearance and basic repairs. One of the first, rare, major contracts was for a university hospital in Bonn, 1946-49. The introduction of the German mark in 1948 {{and the beginning of the}} Wirtschaftswunder brought more new work.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> {{settlement}} {{period of the}} Niagara area, following the American Revolutionary War, new wagon routes were built over native footpaths. Grimsby and Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake) quickly became established settlements, but travel was cumbersome between them. Pioneers were forced to travel south along the Niagara Road to Queenston, where they turned west and followed the Iroquois Road.|$|E

5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> stages of development from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum {{is an extension of}} the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.|$|E

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> {{campaigns of}} World War II, Germany's light tanks, {{including}} the PanzerI, formed {{the bulk of}} its armoured strength. In March1938, the German Army marched into Austria, experiencing a mechanical breakdown rate of up to thirty percent. However, the experience revealed to Guderian several faults within the German Panzerkorps and he subsequently improved logistical support. In October 1938, Germany occupied Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland, and {{the remainder of the}} country in March 1939. The capture of Czechoslovakia allowed several Czech tank designs, such as the Panzer 38(t), and their subsequent variants and production, to be incorporated into the German Army's strength. It also prepared German forces for the invasion of Poland.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> {{development}} {{stages of}} the film, Pixar revisited their work from the original Toy Story and found that, although they could open the old computer files for the animated 3D models, error messages prevented them from editing the files.
