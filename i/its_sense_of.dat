5|$|Most frogs {{identify}} prey by movement, {{and vision}} {{appears to be}} the primary method by which the cane toad detects prey; however, the cane toad can also locate food using <b>its</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell. They eat a wide range of material; in addition to the normal prey of small rodents, reptiles, other amphibians, birds, and even bats and a range of invertebrates, they also eat plants, dog food, and household refuse.|$|E
5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture forages {{using its}} keen {{eyesight}} to locate carrion on the ground, but also uses <b>its</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell, an ability which is uncommon in the avian world. It locates carrion by detecting {{the scent of}} ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Carter and Rosas' writing, vision had not been {{directly}} studied, but field observations show the animal primarily hunts by sight; above water, {{it is able to}} recognize observers at great distances. The fact that it is exclusively active during the day further suggests its eyesight should be strong, to aid in hunting and predator avoidance. In other otter species, vision is generally normal or slightly myopic, both on land and in water. The giant otter's hearing is acute and <b>its</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell is excellent.|$|E

5|$|The Indian Princess is {{one example}} of an attempt by an artist of the early 19th Century to define an American {{national}} identity. Pocahontas, representing the spirit of America, literally shields Smith from injury and serves as foster mother, protecting colonists from famine and attack, achieving mythic status as a heroic mother, and preserving, nurturing and legitimizing America as a country. The play allows for an acknowledgement of the troubling aspects of the nation’s history of conquest, violence, and greed, by couching the negative implications in a romantic plot. In other words, the romantic conquest helps to soften the harshness and brutality of the colonial conquest. The success of the play reflects a larger cultural desire to express <b>its</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> self through the Pocahontas myth.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Russell Boyd largely {{utilized}} available {{light to}} give the movie a natural feel, which Beresford said was crucial to <b>its</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> authenticity. Harper said Boyd was so quiet during filming that he mostly used just three words: Yeah', 'right' and 'sure. Beresford, Foote and Duvall considered the climactic scene {{to be the one}} in which Mac, tending the family garden, discusses with Rosa Lee his pain over his daughter's death. Beresford and Boyd filmed the scene in a long take and long shot so it could flow uninterrupted, with the lonely Texas landscape captured in the background. When studio executives received the footage, they contacted Beresford and requested close-up shots be intercut, but he insisted on keeping the long take intact. Duvall said he felt the scene underscored Mac's stoicism in the face of tragedy and loss.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{of adult}} nuthatches include owls and diurnal {{birds of prey}} (such as sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks), and nestlings and eggs are eaten by woodpeckers, small squirrels, and {{climbing}} snakes such as the western rat snake. The white-breasted nuthatch responds to predators near the nest by flicking its wings while making hn-hn calls. When a bird leaves the nest hole, it wipes around the entrance with a piece of fur or vegetation; this makes it more difficult for a predator to find the nest using <b>its</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell. The nuthatch may also smear blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities. The estimated average lifespan of this nuthatch is two years, but the record is twelve years and nine months.|$|E

5|$|With prey often {{scarce in}} its oceanic environment, the silky shark is a swift, inquisitive, and {{persistent}} hunter. It feeds mainly on bony fishes and cephalopods, {{and has been}} known to drive them into compacted schools before launching open-mouthed, slashing attacks. This species often trails schools of tuna, a favored prey. <b>Its</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> hearing is extremely acute, allowing it to localize the low-frequency noises generated by other feeding animals, and, by extension, sources of food. The silky shark is viviparous, meaning that the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. Significant geographical variation is seen in its life history details. Reproduction occurs year-round except in the Gulf of Mexico, where it follows a seasonal cycle. Females give birth to litters of up to 16pups annually or biennially. The newborn sharks spend their first months in relatively sheltered reef nurseries on the outer continental shelf, growing substantially before moving into the open ocean.|$|E
25|$|Sociologist Ronald Lawson has {{suggested}} {{that it is the}} group's intellectual and organizational isolation—coupled with the intense indoctrination of adherents, rigid internal discipline and considerable persecution—that has contributed to the consistency of <b>its</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> urgency in its apocalyptic message.|$|E
25|$|<b>Its</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> {{smell is}} very well developed, {{to the point that}} the animal is used for drug {{detection}} in Germany. Its hearing is also acute, though its eyesight is comparatively weak, lacking colour vision and being unable to recognise a standing human 10–15 metres away.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the eyes, almost all arachnids have two other types of sensory organs. The most important to most arachnids are the fine sensory hairs that cover the body and give the animal <b>its</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> touch. These can be relatively simple, but many arachnids also possess more complex structures, called trichobothria.|$|E

25|$|According to Simmel, {{in small}} groups, secrets are less needed because {{everyone}} {{seems to be more}} similar. In larger groups secrets are needed {{as a result of their}} heterogeneity.

25|$|A 2011 {{study found}} that the nasal {{passages}} of Euoplocephalus were looped and complex; possibly an adaptation for heat and water balance and vocal resonance, and researchers discovered an enlarged and vascularised chamber {{at the back of the}} nasal tract, which was considered by the authors to be an adaptation to improve <b>its</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell. The researchers also managed to reconstruct the dinosaur's inner ear and concluded that it was capable of hearing at low frequencies. They suggested that this may have been an adaption to hearing low-toned resonant sounds produced by the nasal passages.|$|E
25|$|Nothing {{improved}} {{when the}} government then tried to go into reverse with contractionary macroeconomic policies and renewed depreciation. Output plunged, but inflation once more went up instead of down, to 163 percent by 1985. By this time, pessimism about the government's capacity to solve anything, inflationary expectations turning into understandable convictions, and the price-increasing effect of devaluation all combined to give Peru a seemingly unstoppable inflation despite the elimination of anything that might be considered excess demand. The government apparently lost <b>its</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> direction, retreated from its attempt to reopen the economy by returning to higher tariff levels, and otherwise did little except wait for its own end in 1985.|$|E

25|$|Several {{artists in}} the 1980s and 1990s contributed work that {{influenced}} or took part in deconstructivism. Maya Lin and Rachel Whiteread are two examples. Lin's 1982 project for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, with its granite slabs severing the ground plane, is one. Its shard-like form and reduction of content to a minimalist text influenced deconstructivism, with <b>its</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> fragmentation and emphasis on reading the monument. Lin also contributed work for Eisenman's Wexner Center. Rachel Whiteread's cast architectural spaces are another instance where contemporary art is confluent with architecture. Ghost (1990), an entire living space cast in plaster, solidifying the void, alludes to Derrida's notion of architectural presence. Gordon Matta-Clark's Building cuts were deconstructed sections of buildings exhibited in art galleries.|$|E
25|$|The {{audiovisual}} elements received mixed reviews. GamePro and Electronic Playground both {{found the}} game fun but were disappointed by its graphics. GamePro additionally criticized the audio quality. Total! {{felt that the}} game {{had some of the}} console's worst 3D effects. Next Generation said that the limitations of the Virtual Boy hardware, and the game's ineffective use of its 3D abilities, makes features in the distance difficult to make out. The News Tribune praised its 3D effects as well as the scene transitions and graphics. Allgame's Scott Alan Marriott felt that the audio and sense of depth were poor, but commended its use of shading. Nintendo Magazine positively praised Golfs presentation and the perspective of the ball. Nintendo Life's Dave Frear also praised <b>its</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> distance and course size.|$|E
25|$|The {{neighborhood}} has become home to numerous contemporary art galleries. One {{of the very}} first was ABC No Rio. Begun by a group of Colab no wave artists (some living on Ludlow Street), ABC No Rio opened an outsider gallery space that invited community participation and encouraged the widespread production of art. Taking an activist approach to art that grew out of The Real Estate Show (the take over of an abandoned building by artists to open an outsider gallery only to have it chained closed by the police) ABC No Rio kept <b>its</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> activism, community, and outsiderness. The product of this open, expansive approach to art was a space for creating new works that did not have links to the art market place and that were able to explore new artistic possibilities.|$|E
