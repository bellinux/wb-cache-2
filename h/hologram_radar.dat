40|$|An {{investigation}} of microwave hologram techniques for application to earth resources was {{conducted during the}} period from June 1971 to November 1972. The objective of this investigation has been to verify the feasibility of an orbital microwave holographic radar experiment. The primary advantage of microwave <b>hologram</b> <b>radar</b> (MHR) over the side-looking airborne radar (SLAR) is that of aspect or viewing angle; the MHR has a viewing angle identical with that of photography and IR systems. The combination of these systems can thus extend the multispectral analysis concept to span optical through microwave wavelengths. Another advantage is the capacity of the MHR system to generate range contours by operating in a two-frequency mode. It should be clear that along-track resolution of an MHR can be comparable with SLAR systems, but cross-track resolution will be approximately an order of magnitude coarser than the range resolution achievable with an arbitrary SLAR system. An advantage of the MHR over the SLAR is that less average transmitter power is required. This reduction in power results from the much larger receiving apertures associated with MHR systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of rotating steel platform in the RCS (Radar Cross Section) measurement of vehicles at 22 - 26 GHz for automotive radar application. Across several measurement steps, we compare different RCS measurement results in order to eliminate the undesired RCS contribution caused mainly by the rotating steel platform. We demonstrate that when it is difficult or impossible to use microwave absorbers on the steel platform, an alternative method can be applied. Finally, {{with the help of}} 2 D radar image post processing, we can also identify and separate the RCS contribution of each element (vehicle, steel platform, ground/multipath/clutter) in the hologram image, and therefore obtain the pure RCS distribution of the tested vehicle. key words – RCS, <b>hologram,</b> <b>radar</b> image, automotive radar I. CONTEXT 24 GHz UWB (Ultra Wide Band) [21. 65 - 26. 65 GHz] automotive radar systems are very popular on the market since they provide most of the driving assistance options at a competitive cost [1] [2]. However, in Europe, regulation and permission of 24 GHz UWB for automotive radar is limited in time. Initially, European Commission (EC) decided the cut-off date would be July 2012, but this date is postponed till January 2018 for new vehicle registration and till January 2022 for vehicles registered before 2018 [3]. Therefore, 26 GHz UWB [24 - 29 GHz] will be ready as a replacement for 24 GHz UWB during the cut-off date. Indeed the shift to the 26 GHz band would be much easier to achieve. Moreover, this technology is allowed with no time limit. This paper deals with RCS measurement of vehicles in the frequency of 22 - 26 GHz for automotive radar application. II. CASE OF STUDY In the automotive radar system, it is mandatory to characterize RCS of VUT (Vehicle Under Test) according to different scenarios (viewing angles, distances and speed) in order to set up the alert threshold for different automotiv...|$|E
