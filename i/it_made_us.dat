Blitz previously directed episodes of The Office, a comedy series created by Parks and Recreation co-creator Greg Daniels. Michael Schur, who created Parks along with Daniels, said of Blitz, [...] "He's such a great director, and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> feel, launching this new show, safe and happy to have him." [...] It was originally {{supposed to be the}} second episode shown in the series, but the broadcast schedule was changed and [...] "Canvassing," [...] the original third episode, was shown second instead. Goor was very upset with the switch so, as a prank, the Parks and Recreation producers sent him an e-mail message claiming NBC was going to be further held until the second season because it was preempted by [...] "a sports thing." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} written by {{consulting}} producer Jon Vitti, his second writing credit of the series since joining {{the staff at the}} beginning of the seventh season. It was directed by series star Steve Carell, the third episode he has directed for the series. The episode marked Amy Ryan's last physical appearance on the series, although she did speak in [...] "Goodbye, Michael". Ryan later said in an interview with New York that [...] "The script was so sweet anyway that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> all have a good cry" [...] especially adding the fact that it was her final appearance. She also expressed her confidence that the series could survive without Carell and that it was the right move for him to leave. Vitti later submitted the episode for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, but it was not nominated.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the music}} on Ecstasy has been criticised as being [...] "directionless and floundered about within the {{framework}} of songs which appeared to be only half formed ideas," [...] which was due to the band's in-studio experimentation with different aspects of their guitar sound. In hindsight, Shields said that [...] "even when we'd finished it we didn't like half the songs we'd done. The record never came out right and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> realise that we were still too twee". In response to the band's [...] "unwanted reputation for jangly feyness", My Bloody Valentine later incorporated elements of American indie rock music and Shields customised his guitars' tremolo systems, resulting in the band pioneering an alternative rock subgenre known as shoegazing. The term [...] "shoegazing", which was considered derogatory, was coined by Sounds journalists in the early 1990s to describe certain bands' [...] "motionless performing style, where they stood on stage and stared at the floor".|$|E

500|$|According to Durst, Limp Bizkit would [...] "comb {{the world}} for the illest guitar player known to man" [...] to replace Borland. After holding a {{nationwide}} audition for a new guitarist, [...] "Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is", the band recorded with Snot guitarist Mike Smith. [...] "Mike brought in a breath of fresh air," [...] Durst said. [...] "Creatively, it fit like a glove. It made life easier and more positive. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> look forward to getting together as a band so much more. The positive effect he had on me just made the whole experience of Limp Bizkit feel like a brand-new entity." [...] Before Smith replaced Borland, Durst played a great deal of guitar. Jon Wiederhorn of MTV wrote, [...] "Limp Bizkit jammed with four finalists after their much-publicized guitarist audition tour, but now it looks like Fred Durst might be taking a cue from his Puddle of Mudd pal Wes Scantlin and handling both vocal and guitar duties himself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lead singer Bono {{explained}} {{that he had to}} ask himself a few hard questions before carrying on recording: [...] "I wanted to check where I was to where I am.

And when a miracle occurred and the soup was thick we couldn’t believe it and ate it as slowly as possible. But even with thick soup in a warm stomach there remained a sucking pain; we’d been hungry for too long. All human emotions—love, friendship, envy, concern for one’s fellow man, compassion, longing for fame, honesty— had left us with the flesh that had melted from our bodies...." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{agreeing to}} subsume its own weapons program within the Americans', {{the plan would}} have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952. Although a {{majority}} of Americans including Truman supported the proposal, several key officials, including the Atomic Energy Commission's Lewis Strauss and Senator Arthur Vandenberg, did not. Their opposition, and security concerns caused by the arrest in early 1950 of Klaus Fuchs, a Soviet spy working at Harwell, ended the negotiations in January 1950. After Britain developed atomic weapons through its own efforts, the scientist Sir Leonard Owen nonetheless stated that [...] "the McMahon Act {{was probably one of}} the best things that happened ... as <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> work and think for ourselves along independent lines." ...|$|E

2500|$|Taylor's nickname, [...] "Dummy", was {{commonly}} {{applied to}} [...] "deaf and dumb" [...] baseball {{players in the}} late 19th and early 20th century. [...] Dummy Dundon and Dummy Hoy were the first professional baseball players to receive the appellation. [...] Others include Dummy Deegan, Dummy Leitner, Dummy Lynch, Dummy Murphy and Dummy Stephenson. [...] Although he accepted the nickname in his playing days, Taylor noted in a 1945 interview that he and Dummy Hoy did not care for the nickname: [...] "In the old days Hoy and I were called Dummy. [...] It didn't hurt us. [...] <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>us</b> fight harder." [...] Taylor's popularity led to an outcry in the deaf press {{against the use of}} the nickname.
