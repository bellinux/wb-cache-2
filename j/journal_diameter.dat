50|$|Acceleration (0-60) for the 4-cylinder {{models is}} {{improved}} (around the mid-9-second mark), with comparable fuel efficiency to its predecessor: 23 mpg/city and 30 mpg/hwy for LX and EX models with automatic transmissions. Emissions of Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG), {{also known as}} unburned hydrocarbons, produced during engine warm-up are considerably lower. The LX and EX engines produce less than 0.0075 grams per mile, qualifying them for California LEV (Low-Emission Vehicle) status. In California, the Accord EX with the available automatic transmission will produce less than 0.003 grams per mile of NMOG, qualifying it as the first gasoline-powered vehicle to reach ULEV (Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle) status. The five-main bearing block is high-pressure die-cast from aluminum alloy. The walls of the block extend below the centerline of the crankshaft, which helps stiffen the bottom end. FEM (Finite Element Method) computer {{analysis was used to}} arrive at optimum thicknesses for the block ribs and walls in order to minimize engine vibration. Additional bottom-end rigidity comes from a larger, stronger bearing-cap beam that ties directly into the cylinder-block skirt. An aluminum-alloy stiffener has been added between the transmission case and the block, just behind the bearing carrier. The stiffener serves to tie the block and transmission together into a single, reinforced unit. FEM was also used to design this stiffener so that it would not only stiffen the area, but also help minimize high-frequency engine vibration. Finite-element analysis of the Accord's piston design by Honda engineers yielded a new ultra-short, lightweight skirt design, which is very rigid and resistant to vibration and piston slap. Like the V-6 engine the pistons are gravity-cast aluminum alloy and utilize full-floating wrist pins in order to minimize noise. The engine's drop-forged single-plane steel crankshaft and connecting rods have been designed to be stronger and operate with less friction, much like the V-6 components. The I-section, drop-forged steel connecting rods have a completely new design and are considerably lighter than their predecessors (475 g vs. 578 g), which helps to minimize vibration. Big end-bearing <b>journal</b> <b>diameter</b> has been reduced from 48 mm to 45 mm. Rod thickness is down from 24 mm to 20 mm and the bolt size is smaller. Like the V-6 rod bolts, those of the 4-cylinder engine are torqued to the plastic region of the bolt material in order to ensure a solid union between the bearing cap and the connecting rod. The engine block incorporates the Honda-designed second-order balance system that cancels the inertial forces common to large-displacement 4-cylinder engines. The system consists of two parallel shafts {{on either side of the}} crank-shaft, 81 mm (3.19 in.) above its centerline. Driven by a toothed belt, the balance shafts rotate in opposite directions at twice engine speed. Eccentric weights built into the shafts generate inertial forces that counteract the second-order forces created by the motion of the pistons and connecting rods. This Honda system minimizes vibration in the entire rpm range.|$|E
40|$|Nonlinear {{analysis}} is increasingly {{applied in the}} dynamics analysis of rotor bearing systems. The use of tilting-pad bearings is now a standard feature of many types of rotor systems. The concern for oil film excitation of the rotor lowest natural frequency is eliminated {{by the use of}} the tilting pad journal bearings. For new higher speed or larger low speed applications, the possibility of the pad flutter instability still remains and most commonly used design tools do not consider the pad inertia as a standard feature. In this paper, taking the Jeffcott rotor supported by two 4 pad bearings as an example, the influence of pad inertia and <b>journal</b> <b>diameter</b> were studied. The influence of shaft diameter and pad inertia was determined by the transient response of a simple rotor-bearing system operating over a wide design speed range.

40|$|The {{crankshaft}} is {{a complex}} component, and as such, the influence of its geometric parameters on stresses seen under service loads is not well understood. The objectives of this work are to investigate {{the effects of a}} wide range of geometric parameters on stresses in overlapped crankshafts, to find correlation between results and to formulate simple methods of predicting peak stress levels: It is intended to achieve this by use of the Finite Element (FE) and Boundary Element (BE) methods. Individual crankthrows are loaded under the important load cases of bending and torsion. Stress concentration factors are determined by normalising peak stresses with respect to the nominal stress occurring in the most appropriate section in the neck between the fillets. Analyses are carried out in 2 D and 3 D, making use of symmetry as far as possible. Many of the governing dimensions of the crankthrow are included in the analyses; crankpin and <b>journal</b> <b>diameters,</b> crankpin and <b>journal</b> overlap, and web thickness. Variations in SCF are plotted over a wide range for each of these parameters. Additionally, features such as fillet size and shape, bore-holes, dimples, cut-back webs and oil holes are investigated. It is found that the effects on stress of individual parameter changes can be superimposed to accurately predict the effect of combining various parameter changes in one model. The crankpin and journal fillet radii and the length of the minimum section between the fillets are shown to be the critical parameters in determining the peak stress levels in the crankshaft. SCFs obtained from the range of analyses performed show good agreement with the classical theory of SCFs in notched bars. Bore-holes and dimples are found to offer significant benefits in terms of peak stress reduction, in addition to their common usage of reducing the out of balance crankpin mass. The FE and BE methods give accurate results for stress analysis of crankshafts and offer several advantages over traditional experimental techniques; they are ideally suited to parametric analyses, can be carried out relatively quickly, results are repeatable because boundary conditions can be exactly defined, and the cost of analysis is significantly reduced...|$|R

Two Generation III foil air bearings with the same design but possessing different initial radial clearances were tested at room temperature against an as-ground PS 304 coated journal operating at 30, 000 rpm. Increases in radial clearance were accomplished by reducing the <b>journal's</b> outside <b>diameter</b> via an in-place grinding system. From each load capacity test the bearing load capacity coefficient was calculated from the rule-of-thumb (ROT) model developed for foil air bearings. The test results indicate that, {{in terms of the}} load capacity coefficient, radial clearance has a direct impact on the performance of the foil air bearing. Each test bearing exhibited an optimum radial clearance that resulted in a maximum load capacity coefficient. Relative to this optimum value are two separate operating regimes that are governed by different modes of failure. Bearings operating with radial clearances less than the optimum exhibit load capacity coefficients that are a strong function of radial clearance and are prone to a thermal runaway failure mechanism and bearing seizure. Conversely, a bearing operating with a radial clearance twice the optimum suffered only a 20 percent decline in its maximum load capacity coefficient and did not experience any thermal management problems. However, it is unknown to what degree these changes in radial clearance had on other performance parameters, such as the stiffness and damping properties of the bearings...|$|R

One drives the cracked gas compressor train {{and the other}} drives the propylene refrigeration compressor. The two machines are similar and this paper concentrates on the turbine driving the cracked gas compressors. Both turbines {{had a history of}} high vibration, short bearing life, and unusual sensitivity to thermal changes and imbalance due to operation near the second critical speed. In addition, numerous blade failures had occurred. When additional turbine performance was required, a complete review of the entire turbine including the blade designs, rotordynarnics, and governor operation was commissioned. The performance upgrade included new blading, disks, seals, and other changes to the steam path. A turning gear was added for slow-roll operation to relieve thermal effects and rotor bow. A technique was developed for mounting the turbine disks on the rotor to minimize axial disk runout and local couple imbalances. The high bearing temperatures and high vibration issues were addressed with changes in shaft and bearing designs. A submerged arc welding process increased the governor end <b>journal</b> <b>diameter</b> from 51 / 4 inches to 7 inches. A rotordynamic optimization analysis resulted in replacing the tilting pad bearing on the governor end with an offset-half lobed journal bearing. The tilting pad bearings on the exhaust end of the turbines were retained but redesigned for optimum performance. Interchangeability of bearings between the two machines was maintained. These shaft and bearing changes resulted in a significant reduction in babbitt temperature, shaft vibration, and imbalance sensitivity as well as control of the second critical speed. The interaction of the rotor with the foundation substructure was found to be significant, and its inclusion in the analysis was required to properly design the optimized bearings. The blade design changes and steam path changes produced a more reliable design and greater than the required extra power. The addition of a turning gear drive has eliminated the thermal bow problems. A new electronic governor system has eliminated the wear associated with the original hydraulic governor.

40|$|PaperPg. 19 - 27. This paper {{presents}} {{the highlights of}} a complete rotor dynamics analysis and bearing optimization study that was performed on a 3800 HP multistage steam turbine. This unit is coupled to a three stage, poster-type, centrifugal air compressor with two high speed pinion shafts engaging a common bull gear. The turbine drives the lower speed pinion at a maximum speed of 10, 500 rpm. Located {{at the other end}} of this same pinion is the first stage impeller wheel. The second and third stages are mounted on the higher speed pinion, rotating at a maximum speed of 13, 600 rpm. The maximum speed of the bull gear is 1, 940 rpm. All the existing compressor bearings are the four-lobe type. The original turbine rotor consists of three stages and has a 41. 34 inch bearing span. The bearings are lemon-bore type with <b>journal</b> <b>diameters</b> of 3. 0 and 4. 0 inches on the inlet and exhaust ends, respectively. This turbine has exhibited subsynchronous vibration, at approximately half rotational speed, during field testing. The half frequency vibration prevented operation above 9, 400 rpm because a shaft resonance was excited and vibration levels became prohibitively high. The analysis of the existing rotor-bearing system predicts that the turbine operates close to the second critical speed and that the rotor is stable under normal load conditions. However, the rotor becomes unstable when the lemon-bore bearings are unloaded. There are two major sources of bearing load in addition to gravity. These loads are misalignment and gear mesh loading. Misalignment can result from differential thermal growth of the turbine and compressor cases and supports. If the coupling does not act as an ideal joint, this differential growth can impose external loads at the bearings. The bearing load resulting from the gear mesh is a reaction to the torque transmission at the gear interface. For example, the turbine driver rotates in the counter-clockwise direction. Therefore, the low speed pinion gear tends to climb up the bull gear, which causes an upward external load on the pinion bearings. As in the case of misalignment, if the coupling is not ideal, the turbine bearings can also be affected by these gear mesh reaction loads. This analysis is primarily concerned with the effect of these external loads that oppose gravity and cause degrees of net bearing unloading because the unloading causes rotor instability. The rotor is unstable with 75 pounds unloading at each bearing or 110 pounds unloading at the exhaust end bearing alone (with a normal gravity load at the inlet end bearing). As a solution to the problem, a new set of bearings was designed to stabilize the rotor and move the peak response speeds away from the operating speed range. The new bearings are five-shoe-tilt-pad bearings with load-between-pad orientation. The inlet end bearing has a 3. 0 inch diameter bore with length-to-diameter ratio of 1. 0; and preload of 0. 8. The exhaust end bearing has a 3. 995 inch diameter bore with a length-to-diameter ratio of 0. 4 and preload of 0. 0. With the new tilt-pad bearing design there are no response peaks in the normal operating speed range and the system log decrement is 2. 8 times higher than with the existing system, under normal load conditions. The log decrement for the tilt-pad bearings is + 0. 52 for an unloading of 100 pounds. Therefore, the tilt-pads provide a stable rotor support that is not sensitive to unloading...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that hydrodynamic journal bearings are responsible for self-excited vibrations and {{have the effect of}} lowering the critical speeds of rotor systems. The forces within the oil film wedge, generated by the vibrating journal, may be represented by displacement and velocity coefficient~ thus allowing the dynamical behaviour of the rotor to be analysed both for stability purposes and for anticipating the response to unbalance. However, information describing these coefficients is sparse, misleading, and very often not applicable to industrial type bearings. Results of a combined analytical and experimental investigation into the hydrodynamic oil film coefficients operating in the laminar region are therefore presented, the analysis being applied to a 120 degree partial journal bearing having a 5. 0 in <b>diameter</b> <b>journal</b> and a LID ratio of 1. 0. The theoretical analysis shows that for this type of popular bearing, the eight linearized coefficients do not accurately describe the behaviour of the vibrating journal based on the theory of small perturbations, due to them being masked by the presence of nonlinearity. A method is developed using the second order terms of Taylor expansion whereby design charts are provided which predict the twentyeight force coefficients for both aligned, and for varying amounts of journal misalignment.

40|$|A low order {{model was}} created to analyze a small scale gas bearing {{designed}} for the MIT microfabricated gas turbine engine. The <b>journal</b> has a <b>diameter</b> of 4. 1 mm and is designed to spin at 2 million rpm. Due to microfabrication constraints, the bearing {{will have a very}} low length to diameter ratio (O(. 1)) and a very large clearance to radius ratio (0 (0. 01)). As a result, the bearing lies outside the standard operating regime and stable operation is a challenge. The model presented in this paper is able to predict the bearing's behavior under hydrodynamic, hydrostatic and hybrid operation. The model is an application of Newton's second law of motion to the journal, after it has undergone a sudden perturbation from an assumed stable operating point. The equations include stiffness coefficients taken from a numerical simulation of the compressible Reynolds equation, and damping coefficients taken from a short width Full-Sommerfeld solution. The equations of motion are then modified, and rewritten in matrix form using variables relevant to the bearing literature. By studying the eigenvalues of the linear model, it is possible to determine at any operating point: 1) whether the journal can sustain stable operation, and 2) the whirling frequency of the journal. The model's results have been validated for hydrodynamic operation based on the Half-Sommerfeld and Full- Sommerfeld model coefficients. Analysis shows {{that the best way to}} operate the bearing is in a hybrid mode where the bearing relies on hydrostatics at low speeds and hydrodynamics at high speeds. However, in transitioning from hydrostatic to hydrodynamic operation, the model shows that the bearing is prone to instability problems and great care must be taken in the operating schedule. by Nicholas Savoulides.
