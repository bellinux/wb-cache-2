40|$|Abstract- Concurrently, a {{symbolic}} approach for analog system-level fault diagnosis and a systematic approach {{to maximize the}} fault location capability are proposed. This unified approach is realized {{as a result of}} combining the simulation before test (SBT) <b>fault</b> <b>dictionary</b> diagnosis method with {{a symbolic}} approach. The traditional SBT <b>fault</b> <b>dictionary</b> method is often costly and inefficient because of a high number of simulations, but it can become very efficient when a symbolic approach is employed. This symbolic approach only requires one analysis for circuit topology to generate the network transfer function and a parameter substitution to obtain the frequency response (or time response) of the system. An efficient program is developed to deal with the frequency responses of the system to provide the optimum testing point set, and to automatidy generate the <b>fault</b> <b>dictionary.</b> The “distance” between the measurement data and the frequency responses from the <b>fault</b> <b>dictionary</b> is evaluated to determine the diagnosis results.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{formulation}} of diagnostic techniques for detecting and isolating faults in hybrid electrical systems. The techniques are developed using model-variation studies. Diagnostic techniques are valuable because they permit the engineer to a priori assess {{the performance of a}} system containing a malfunction. Furthermore, by knowing a priori how a fault will affect output signals, the engineer can design programmed equipment which will automatically monitor the system signals and detect the occurrence of a malfunction. My primary overall objective in this investigation has been to formalize the approach used to develop diagnostic information for hybrid electrical systems. The approach is formulated in Chapter 1. The need for efficient diagnostic analysis methods has grown as systems have become more complex. The heuristic methods for system testing which have been applied in the past are no longer satisfactory. Diagnostic analysis covers the areas of test information generation and test procedure specification. These are complementary. Unless test information can be computed prior to the occurrence of actual system faults, {{there is no way of}} knowing for certain that the test procedures specified are effective. Applications of diagnostic analysis are to test equipment specification and diagnostic data development. The latter application is essential to all diagnostic studies and is particularly useful for compiling <b>fault</b> <b>dictionaries</b> or maintenance charts which list the likely faults, given a set of symptoms. The approach formulated in Chapter 1 is explicated in Chapters 2, 3, and 4. Techniques are developed which are useful for deriving fault detection and isolation information and for specifying efficient tests. Methods for applying diagnostic models to analogue, combinationa 1 and sequential network diagnosis are developed in these chapters. During the draft stages of this thesis, each chapter was written to "stand alone". Unfortunately repetition has not been completely eliminated from this draft and some unnecessary overlap occurs in various places. In addition, the presentation is largely informal in the sense that it is devoid of mathematica 1 development. Because premature mathematical formalism can sometimes obscure the simplicity of the ideas, I have used words where symbols might well have abbreviated the discussion. Owing to the original drafting method and the style of presentation, the number of pages is rather more than might be expected or desired. To the reader, I recommend that Chapter 0 be read quickly. Chapter 1 is long but the ideas are definitive and much of the material forms the background for subsequent chapters. In Chapter 2, the first part may be skimmed. It contains some of the material in Chapter 1 masticated for the analogue network digestive system. The first thirty pages can be scanned. In Chapter 3, Sections 3. 2 and 3. 6 - 3. 7 are largely original. Chapter 4 is short and can be read rather more quickly than the previous chapters...|$|R

En el caso de las FPGAs {{basadas en}} memoria SRAM de Xilinx, éstas soportan Reconfigurabilidad Parcial Dinámica (DPR) por medio del Internal Configuration Access Port (ICAP). Este componente físico permite acceder a la memoria de configuración mientras el sistema está operando y {{por lo tanto}} la DPR puede ser usada para modificar partes específicas del sistema mientras que el resto sigue funcionando sin ser afectado. La arquitectura del sistema pude ser modificada a nivel de componentes lógicos básicos como Look-Up-Tables (LUTs), o a nivel de bloques más grandes como IPs con lo cual la flexibilidad de los sistemas puede mejorar. Ésta es una gran ventaja especialmente en sistemas críticos, como los aeroespaciales, donde el acceso al sistema para modificar su {{hardware}} no es una tarea sencilla. Pero el principal problema que estas FPGAs presentan cuando son utilizadas para aplicaciones críticas es su susceptibilidad a Single Event Upset (SEU) y Multi-bit Upset (MBU) en la memoria de configuración. Éste es un factor limitante que debe ser considerado para evitar malfuncionamiento del hardware implementado. Esta tesis está enfocada en usar DPR como un mecanismo para: i) mejorar la flexibilidad del hardware, ii) emular fallos de forma precisa en diseños ASIC mapeados en FPGAs y iii) mejorar la tolerancia a fallos acumulados o múltiples en la memoria de configuración de circuitos con Triple Redundancia Modular (TMR). Este trabajo aborda estos aspectos considerando como figura de mérito fundamental la velocidad de ejecución de las tareas. Por lo tanto uno de los principales objetivos es acelerar las tareas relacionadas con DPR. En primer lugar un controlador hardware para el ICAP fue diseñado: AC_ICAP. Éste además de soportar lectura y escritura de frames, manejo de bitstreams parciales desde memoria flash y memoria interna de la FPGA, también permite DPR de alta velocidad a nivel de LUTs sin necesidad de bitstreams parciales previamente generados. Esta última característica es posible gracias a ingeniería inversa en el bitstream con la cual se puede ejecutar DPR de LUTs individuales en menos de 5 μs. Ésto representa una mejora en tiempo de reconfiguración de más de 380 veces comparado con el controlador XPS_HWICAP de Xilinx En segundo lugar, la DPR a nivel de LUTs es utilizada en la emulación de fallos para evaluar circuitos ASIC mapeados en FPGAs. Para ello se diseña un CAD que incluye un traductor de la descripción ASIC a una descripción basada en LUTs para ser implementada en FPGAs, generación de diccionarios de fallos y extracción de patrones de prueba. Una plataforma hardware usa el listado de fallos y aprovecha la DPR de la FPGA para la inyección precisa de fallos seguida de la aplicación de los patrones de test para analizar los efectos de los fallos en el circuito. Finalmente la DPR es utilizada para mejorar la tolerancia a fallos de circuitos TMR implementados en FPGAs basados en memoria SRAM. En estos dispositivos la acumulación de fallos en la memoria de configuración puede generar fallos en las réplicas TMR. Por lo tanto la rápida detección y corrección de fallos sin detener el sistema es un requerimiento que se debe cumplir cuando se usan estas FPGAs en la implementación de sistemas críticos. Para ello se insertan detectores de errores de tipo XNOR que convergen en componentes carry-chain de la FPGA y además cada dominio es aislado en áreas diferentes del dispositivo para los cuales se extraen bitstreams parciales. Éstos son utilizados para corregir los fallos cuando los detectores son activados. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices persist as fundamental components {{in the design and}} evaluation of electronic systems. They are continuously reported as final implementation platforms rather than only prototype elements. The inherent reconfigurable characteristics that FPGAs offer {{are one of the most}} important advantages in the actual hardware implementation and redesign of systems. In the case of Xilinx SRAM-based FPGAs they support Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) by means of the Internal Configuration Access Port (ICAP). This hardwired element allows the configuration memory to be accessed at run time. DPR can then be used to change specific parts of the system while the rest continues to operate with no affection in its computations. Therefore the architecture of the system can be modified at the level of basic logic components such as Look-Up-Tables (LUTs), or bigger blocks such as IP cores, and in this way more flexible systems can be designed. It is a great advantage especially in critical and aerospace applications where the access to the system to re-design the hardware is not a trivial task. But on the other hand, the main problem these FPGAs present when used for critical applications is their sensitivity to Single Event Upset (SEU) and Multi-bit Upset (MBU) in the configuration memory. It is a limiting factor that must be considered to avoid misbehavior of the implemented hardware. This thesis is focused on using DPR as a mechanism to: i) improve hardware flexibility, ii) emulate faults on ASIC designs mapped in FPGAs and iii) improve tolerance to accumulated or multiple faults in the configuration memory of Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) circuits. This work addresses the three challenges considering as one of the most relevant figures of merit the speed at which the tasks can be performed. It is therefore one of the main objectives we consider: the speed-up of DPR related tasks. In the first place we developed a new high speed ICAP controller, named AC_ICAP, completely implemented in hardware. In addition to similar solutions to accelerate the management of partial bitstreams and frames, AC_ICAP also supports DPR of LUTs without requiring pre-computed partial bitstreams. This last characteristic was possible by performing reverse engineering on the bitstream. This allows DPR of single LUTs in Virtex- 5 devices to be performed in less than 5 μs which implies a speed-up of more than 380 x compared to the Xilinx XPS_HWICAP controller. In the second place, the fine grain DPR obtained with the utilization of the AC_ICAP is used in the emulation of faults to test ASIC circuits implemented in FPGAs. It is achieved by designing a CAD flow that includes a custom technology mapping of the ASIC net-list to LUT-level FPGA net-list, the creation of <b>fault</b> <b>dictionaries</b> and the extraction of test patterns. A hardware platform takes the fault list and leverages the partial reconfiguration capabilities of the FPGA for fault injection followed by application of test patterns for fault analysis purposes. Finally, we use DPR to improve the fault tolerance of TMR circuits implemented in SRAM-based FPGAs. In these devices the accumulation of faults in the configuration memory can cause the TMR replicas to fail. Therefore fast detection and correction of faults without stopping the system is a required constraint when these FPGAs in the implementation of critical systems. This is carried out by inserting flag error detector based on XNOR and carry-chain components, isolating and constraining the three domains to known areas and extracting partial bitstreams for each domain. The latter are used to correct faults when the flags are activated...|$|R
40|$|From the {{analysis}} of the book proposal form, the authors have reported that no supplementary material will be provided. However, as the book will regard mainly the application of fault tolerant control techniques to real processes, {{it would be interesting to}} have back-of-book CD-Rom or ftp/www links that provide the real examples and data shown in the monograph. The reviewer agrees with the authors regarding the categories that describe the book. It is designed for courses at post-graduate levels, as it is a monograph reporting a detailed treatment on a specific subject. However, it could be seen also as a manual, i. e. used by practitioners. Regarding book’s contents, the authors should try to provide a monograph that is a valuable resource for researchers from both academia and industry. It should be used also in graduate-level courses. Even if the book could try to cover quite different diagnosis and fault-tolerant control methods, the authors should achieve a coherent presentation of them. The reviewer hopes that most readers will find the presentation self-contained. Obviously, the material should be readable and clearly presented. The authors should avoid that points of a section are not very obvious (such as some sections of “Diagnosis and Fault-Tolerant Control” by Mogens Blanke, Michel Kinnaert, Jan Lunze, and Marcel Staroswiecki, see Chapter 4) or insufficiently elaborated (such as Chapter 7 of “Diagnosis and Fault-Tolerant Control”). However, the reader could pursue further topics of interest with the help of the detailed and updated bibliographical notes that the authors aim to provide at the end of the book (Section 7). According to the book’s provisional table of contents, the book seems to be organised in 6 main chapters and the 7 th one is the bibliography. Chapter 1 should be introductory, presenting an overview of the main ideas of the book, examples, and the various types of models used in the book (the same as Sections 1 and 2 of Isermann’s textbook). Chapter 2 should try to present models and methods applicable at a higher-level of abstraction, in which the analytical details of the plant model are absent. This chapter should address briefly also fault modelling, the diagnosis and fault-tolerant control schemes. As claimed by the authors, the major contribution of the monograph seems to concern Chapters 3, 4 and 5, where the approaches presented in the book will be illustrated on several real application examples, namely the three-tank system (Chapter 3), the winding machine (Chapter 4) and the active suspension system (Chapter 5). The major approaches of the book will be illustrated on these examples in these chapters. For each application example, in Section 3, 4 and 5, the monitored system should be described in detail, as shown in the journal paper “Fault-Toleran Control in Dynamic Systems: Application to a Winding machine” by Noura, Sauter, Hamelin and Theillion. For each case, the fault diagnosis and the fault tolerant control should be designed and presented. The fault cases, their descriptions and examples should complete each application chapter. From the provisional Table of Contents, Appendices do not seem to be present, even if they could be added for providing useful background e. g., in linear algebra, system theory basics, and controller design, if necessary. As for Isermann’s book, the descriptions of the terminology of the book and a <b>fault</b> technical <b>dictionary</b> could be included e. g. in Chapter 1 or 2. In particular, Chapters 3, 4 and 5 seem to represent the main contribution of this monograph. In fact, the works regarding FDI and FTC, which will be recalled in Chapter 2, will be validated on real application and not only by simulation, as suggested by the book’s authors. A complete architecture of a fault-tolerant control system should be briefly illustrated in Chapter 2. Therefore, these FTC strategies should be described in more detail in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 by taking into account the system modelling, the nominal control, the fault diagnosis and the fault compensation or the modification of the control law, according to the results issued from the fault diagnosis module, also recalled in Chapter 2. It is worth noting that the presentation of real industrial problems in these fields can be difficult due to confidential aspects. According to the book proposal form and from Prof. Noura’s CV, for many years the authors have been conducted {{the analysis}} of this kind of FDT methods through their application to realistic systems, corresponding to subsystems in large-scale industrial processes. The authors suggested to present the theoretical methods in a pedagogical manner. These methods will be applied to the systems cited above. The results should be clearly illustrated and commented using plots and tables. The generic way to apply these methods to many systems will be shown, when the system model is available, depending on its accuracy and detail level. Finally, according to the book proposal form, the authors have stated that this book may be oriented to both academic and industrial communities. In particular, for industrial practising engineers (R & D industrial area), the various applications involved in the complete design of FTC and FDI systems could provide a useful tool for an immediate transfer including limits of applicability. For the University and academic communities, the monograph could be useful for post-graduate, Ph. D. students and researchers. In fact, the design examples could be used in courses regarding Automatic Control, Electrical or Mechanical Engineering...|$|R

Early detection of faults in a circuit can greatly assist in&# 13; maintenance of the system by avoiding possibly harmful damage borne out of the fault. Approach: A&# 13; novel method for establishing a <b>fault</b> <b>dictionary</b> using Wavelet transform is presented. The Circuit&# 13; Under Test (CUT) is three phase single level inverter. The transform coefficients for the fault free&# 13; circuit {{as well as for the}} simulated faults of CUT are found. The Wavelet transform is applied to the&# 13; output of CUT and Standard Deviation (SD) of the transform coefficients are extracted. Using the&# 13; transform coefficients, <b>fault</b> <b>dictionary</b> has been formed. In order to identify the type of fault, a neural&# 13; network classifier has been utilized. Results: The compatibility of wavelet analysis with the various&# 13; classification techniques for fault diagnosis has been illustrated in this study. The results of the study&# 13; demonstrate the suitability and viability of wavelet analysis in fault diagnosis of power electronic&# 13; circuits. Conclusion: The proposed approach is found to be more reliable in accurate identification and&# 13; isolation of faults using <b>fault</b> <b>dictionary.</b> Moreover, the neural classifier improves the efficiency of the&# 13; system as neural networks do not require prior knowledge as they are capable of learning and evolving&# 13; through a number of learning algorithms...|$|E
