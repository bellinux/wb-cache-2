5|$|As {{viewed by}} the Catholic Church, Baptism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> three sacraments of {{initiation}} as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. It makes a person {{a member of the}} Church. As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit {{on the part of the}} person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin. If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what the Church does when she baptises") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula.|$|E
