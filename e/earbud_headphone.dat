25|$|Passive noise {{isolation}} is essentially using {{the body of}} the earphone, either over or in the ear, as a passive earplug that simply blocks out sound. The headphone types that provide most attenuation are in-ear canal headphones and closed-back headphones, both circumaural and supra aural. Open-back and <b>earbud</b> <b>headphones</b> provide some passive noise isolation, but much less than the others. Typical closed-back headphones block 8 to 12dB, and in-ears anywhere from 10 to 15dB. Some models have been specifically designed for drummers, with the aim to be able to monitor the recorded sound while shutting out the sound coming directly from the drums {{at the same time as}} much as possible. Such headphones claim to reduce ambient noise by around 25dB.|$|R
