2500|$|In {{genetics}} and developmental biology, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is a laboratory strategy {{for creating a}} viable embryo from a body cell and an egg cell. The technique consists of taking an <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocyte</b> (egg cell) and implanting a donor nucleus from a somatic (body) cell. It is used in both therapeutic and reproductive cloning. Dolly the Sheep became famous for being the first successful case of the reproductive cloning of a mammal. [...] "Therapeutic cloning" [...] refers to the potential use of SCNT in regenerative medicine; this approach has been championed as {{an answer to the}} many issues concerning embryonic stem cells (ESC) and the destruction of viable embryos for medical use, though questions remain on how homologous the two cell types truly are.|$|E

The nucleus of the transfected fibroblast was then inserted into the <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocyte</b> of another dog, leading to generation of dog oocytes expressing the red fluorescent protein. These cloned embryos were then implanted into the uterus of a surrogate mother. It was hoped to use this procedure to investigate the effect of the hormone oestrogen on fertility.

40|$|Until recently, {{fertilization}} was {{the only}} way to produce viable mammalian offspring, a process implicitly involving male and female gametes. However, techniques involving fusion of embryonic or fetal somatic cells with <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocytes</b> have become steadily more successful in generating cloned young. Dolly the sheep was produced by electrofusion of sheep mammary-derived cells with <b>enucleated</b> sheep <b>oocytes.</b> Here we investigate the factors governing embryonic development by introducing nuclei from somatic cells (Sertoli, neuronal and cumulus cells) taken from adult mice into <b>enucleated</b> mouse <b>oocytes.</b> We found that some <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocytes</b> receiving Sertoli or neuronal nuclei developed in vitro and implanted following transfer, but none developed beyond 8. 5 days post coitum; however, a high percentage of <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocytes</b> receiving cumulus nuclei developed in vitro. Once transferred, many of these embryos implanted and, although most were subsequently resorbed, a significant proportion (2 to 2. 8 %) developed to term.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the influence of post-cleavage time of nuclear donors {{on the development of}} reconstituted embryos in bovine nuclear transfer. Blastomeres of 16 -cell stage embryos derived from in vitro-maturation, fertilization and culture were used as nuclear donor source. They were treated with 10 μM nocodazole for 12 hr. Blastomeres that cleaved within 3 hr after the removal of nocodazole were used for the study. Metaphase II (M-II) oocytes were used as recipient cytoplasm. In experiment 1, donor blastomeres at 6, 11 and 15 hr after the removal of nocodazole and donor blastomeres not treated with nocodazole were transferred into ethanol-exposed and <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocytes.</b> The reconstituted embryos produced by donor blastomeres at 6 hr after the removal of nocodazole had a significantly higher developmental rate to the blastocyst stage than those at 15 hr and the untreated groups (P< 0. 01). In experiment 2, blastomeres at 6 hr after the removal of nocodazole used as nuclear donors were transferred into ethanol-exposed and <b>enucleated</b> M-II <b>oocytes.</b> The reconstituted embryos with ethanol-exposed and <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocytes</b> as recipient cytoplasm had a significantly higher rate of initial-cleavage (P< 0. 05) and development to the blastocyst stage (P< 0. 01) than non ethanol-exposed and <b>enucleated</b> M-II <b>oocytes.</b> These results demonstrate that the development of reconstituted embryos was improved when cleaved donor blastomeres after the removal of nocodazole were immediately transferred (at 3 - 6 hr post-cleavage) into activated <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocytes</b> by exposure to ethanol...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{amphibian}} oocytes, it {{is known}} that germinal vesicle (GV) materials are essential for sperm head decondensation but not for activation of MPF (CDK 1 and cyclin B). However, in large animals, the role of GV materials in maturation and fertilization is not defined. In this study, we prepared <b>enucleated</b> pig <b>oocytes</b> at the GV stage and cultured them to examine the activation and inactivation of CDK 1 and MAP kinase during maturation and after electro-activation. Moreover, enucleated GV-oocytes after maturation culture were inseminated or injected intracytoplasmically with spermatozoa to examine their ability to decondense the sperm chromatin. <b>Enucleated</b> <b>oocytes</b> showed similar activation/inactivation patterns of CDK 1 and MAP kinase as sham-operated oocytes during maturation and after electro-stimulation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection. During the time corresponding to MI/MII transition of sham-operated <b>oocytes,</b> <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocytes</b> inactivated CDK 1. However, penetrating sperm heads in <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocytes</b> did not decondense enough to form male pronuclei. To determine whether the factor(s) involved in sperm head decondensation remains associated with the chromatin after GV breakdown (GVBD), we did enucleation soon after GVBD (corresponding to pro-metaphase I, pMI) to remove only chromosomes. The injected sperm heads in pMI-enucleated oocytes decondensed and formed the male pronuclei. These results suggest that in pig oocytes, GV materials are not required for activation/inactivation of CDK 1 and MAP kinase, but they are essential for male pronucleus formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} of the nuclear program of a somatic cell from a differentiated to an undifferentiated state {{can be accomplished by}} transplanting its nucleus to an <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocyte</b> (SCNT) in a process termed ‘reprogramming'. This process achieves pluripotency and occasionally also totipotency. Exploiting the obstacle of tetraploidy to full development in mammals, we show that mouse ooplasts transplanted with two somatic nuclei simultaneously (double SCNT) support preimplantation development and derivation of novel tetraploid SCNT embryonic stem cells (tNT-ESCs). Although the double SCNT embryos do not recapitulate the expression pattern of the pluripotency-associated gene Oct 4 in fertilized embryos, derivative tNT-ESCs have characteristics of genuine pluripotency: in vitro they differentiate into neurons, cardiomyocytes and endodermal cells; in vivo, tNT-ESCs form teratomas, albeit at reduced rates compared to diploid counterparts. Global transcriptome analysis revealed only few specific alterations, e. g. in the quantitative expression of gastrulation-associated genes. In conclusion, we have shown that the oocyte's reprogramming capacity is in excess of a single nucleus and that double nucleus transplanted embryos and derivative ESCs are very similar to their diploid counterparts. These results have key implications for reprogramming studies based on pluripotency: while reprogramming in the tetraploid state was known from fusion-mediated reprogramming and from fetal and adult hepatocyte-derived iPS cells, we have now accomplished it with <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocyte...</b>|$|E

However, high numbers of mature, fertilizable oocytes are often difficult to obtain. The culture of primordial follicles as a method of oocyte maturation has had limited success.

30|$|Preceding {{localization}} and engraftment of {{stem cells}} we need to realize the implications of immune barriers on stem cell transplants. In terms of immunity stem cells can be classified as autologous (taken from patient tissues) which doesn’t spark an immune reaction and allogenic (taken from unrelated donors) which may spark immune reaction requiring immune suppression. In order to circumvent the problems of immune suppression in regenerative therapy researchers {{have come up with}} genetically equivalent (isogenic) cells. These isogenic cells are produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT; wherein adult somatic cell nucleus is injected into an <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocyte)</b> forming pluripotent ESCs from adult somatic cells. Alternatively, this is achieved by reprogramming adult somatic cells back to a pluripotent state using a set of transcription factors, also known as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells).|$|E

Separation of polypeptides extracted from the cytoplasm of GV by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE revealed that a 55 kDa polypeptide was present only in the GVs of rat oocytes. At 0, 12, 24, 36, and 44 hr after PMSG injection, prior to the initiation of maturation, <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocytes</b> synthesized the same major polypeptides as cumulus intact (CI) oocytes. During meiotic maturation, no major changes were detected in protein synthesis from prophase (GV stage) to prometaphase I (0 - 6 hr IVM). However, after entry into prometaphase I (7 hr IVM), striking changes were seen; a 24 kDa polypeptide disappeared and expression of a 34 kDa polypeptide became stronger. This pattern lasted until metaphase II. We detected no major differences in the pattern of protein synthesis between CI and <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocytes</b> using two-dimensional PAGE. These results indicate that protein synthesis in the maturing rat oocyte is controlled by cytoplasmic regulators rather than intrinsic nuclear components. Li Meng, Jean Rutledge, Ying Zhu, Gerald M.

40|$|Summary: Lysine {{acetylation}} on core histones of {{somatic cell}} genome can be reprogrammed by <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocyte</b> through two different programs in somatic cloned embryos. Epigenetic reprogramming {{is thought to}} play an important role in the development of cloned embryos reconstructed by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). In the present study, dynamic reprogramming of histone acetylation and methylation modifications was investigated in the first cell cycle of cloned embryos. Our results demonstrated that part of somatic inherited lysine acetylation on core histones (H 3 K 9, H 3 K 14, H 4 K 16) could be quickly deacetylated following SCNT, and reacetylation occurred following activation treatment. However, acetylation marks of the other lysine residues on core histones (H 4 K 8, H 4 K 12) persisted in the genome of cloned embryos with only mild deacetylation occurring in the process of SCNT and activation treatment. The somatic cloned embryos established histone acetylation modifications resembling those in normal embryos produced by intracytoplasmic sperm injection through these two different programs...|$|E
40|$|During {{the natural}} event of {{fertilization}} highly differentiated spermatozoa may {{revert to the}} totipotency of early embryonic stages. Such cells {{have the capacity to}} develop into a whole organism or to differentiate into any of its cells or tissues. Reversion is driven by the cytoplasm of the mature oocyte which is capable of reprogramming the donor nucleus. It is likely that the idea of using the laboratory technique of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) for creating an ovum with a donor nucleus stemmed from this observation. Many {{attempts have been made to}} determine the underlying mechanism of reprogramming and to improve nuclear transfer procedures in order to optimize the outcomes of SCNT. Although numerous reports have demonstrated the proof of principle of using SCNT technology to clone fertile offspring in several different mammalian species, success rates remain low. Most failures appear to result from incomplete reprogramming of the donor nucleus in an <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocyte.</b> The pressing need to improve the efficiency of SCNT may require a modified or entirely novel methodology to be established.

40|$|While {{reprogramming}} {{a foreign}} nucleus after somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), the <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocyte</b> (ooplasm) must signal that biomass and cellular requirements changed {{compared to the}} nucleus donor cell. Using cells expressing nuclear-encoded but mitochondria-targeted EGFP, a strategy was developed to directly distinguish maternal and embryonic products, testing ooplasm demands on transcriptional and post-transcriptional activity during reprogramming. Specifically, we compared transcript and protein levels for EGFP and other products in pre-implantation SCNT embryos, side-by-side to fertilized controls (embryos produced from the same oocyte pool, by intracytoplasmic injection of sperm containing the EGFP transgene). We observed that while EGFP transcript abundance is not different, protein levels are significantly lower in SCNT compared to fertilized blastocysts. This was not observed for Gapdh and Actb, whose protein reflected mRNA. This transcript-protein relationship indicates that the somatic nucleus {{can keep up with}} ooplasm transcript demands, whilst transcription and translation mismatch occurs after SCNT for certain mRNAs. We further detected metabolic disturbances after SCNT, suggesting a place among forces regulating post-transcriptional changes during reprogramming.

On injection of ntES cells into tetraploid blastocysts to generate clonal mice that are nearly completely ntES-cell derived, live pups were obtained; four clonal mice survived until adulthood. On injection of ntES cells into diploid blastocysts, chimeric mice with a high somatic ES cell contribution were generated; germ-line transmission was obtained.

40|$|In {{almost all}} animal species, {{immature}} oocytes are arrested naturally {{in the first}} meiotic prophase, with a large nucleus called the germinal vesicle. A number of previous studies showed that both activation of maturation/M phase-promoting factor (MPF) (assayed by semiquantitative cytological methods) and some other maturational events occur essentially normally in <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocytes</b> from many amphibian species and mice. Hence, for nearly three decades, it has generally been believed that nuclear material is dispensable for MPF activation and the meiotic cell cycle in vertebrate oocytes.

Comparative analysis of gene expression in morula-stage embryos was carried out using single-embryo transcriptome amplification and global gene expression analyses. Genomic DNA fingerprinting and PCR analysis confirmed that the nuclear genome of the cloned embryos originated from the donor somatic cell. Although the human–human, human–bovine, and human–rabbit clones appeared morphologically similar and continued development to the morula stage at approximately the same rate (39, 36, and 36 %, respectively), the pattern of reprogramming of the donor genome was dramatically different.

While modifying epigenetic states of cloned embryos can improve their development, the production rate of cloned embryos can also be enhanced by changing other factors. It has already been shown that abnormal chromosome segregation (ACS) is a major cause of the developmental failure of cloned embryos and that Latrunculin A (LatA), an actin polymerization inhibitor, improves F-actin formation and birth rate of cloned embryos. Since F-actin is important for chromosome congression in embryos, here we examined the relation between ACS and F-actin in cloned embryos. Using LatA treatment, the occurrence of ACS decreased significantly whereas cloned embryo-specific epigenetic abnormalities such as dimethylation of histone H 3 at lysine 9 (H 3 K 9 me 2) could not be corrected.

Karyotype analysis of IVF revealed a similar proportion of diploid embryos in androgenetic and control blastocysts (35 % and 36 %, respectively), although mixoploid blastocysts were frequently observed in both groups (64 %). Androgenotes had lower total cell numbers than control and parthenogenetic embryos, but more cells in ICM cells comparing to parthenogenotes (30. 42 vs. 17. 15 %).

Additionally, cloning efficiency can be reduced by low fusion rate of the cell fusion method, and specialized micromanipula-tion equipment and exacting nucleus isolation techniques are required for the nucleus injection method. Here we report a whole-cell injection technique for nuclear transfer in pigs {{and the production of}} cloned piglets with comparable, if not higher, efficiency than the other two nuclear transfer procedures. First, we tested the feasibility of this technique with three types of frequently used donor cells (cumulus, mural granulosa, and fi-broblasts) and obtained the optimal nuclear reprogramming conditions for these cells. We further improved our protocol by avoiding ultraviolet exposure during enucleation and achieved a 37 % blastocyst rate. We then conducted whole-cell injection using skin fibroblasts from the ear of a sow transgenic for two genes, the porcine lactoferrin and the human factor IX, and pro-duced four live-born cloned transgenic piglets from three recip-ients. The present study demonstrated the applicability of pro-ducing normal, cloned piglets by the simple and less labor-in-tensive whole-cell intracytoplasmic injection. assisted reproductive technology, early development, embry...|$|E
40|$|Generally in mammals, {{individual}} animals contain only maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), as paternal (sperm) -derived mitochondria {{are usually}} eliminated during early development. Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) bypasses the normal routes of mtDNA inheritance and introduces {{not only a}} different nuclear genome into the recipient cytoplast (in general an <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocyte)</b> but also somatic mitochondria. Differences in mtDNA genotype between recipient oocytes and potential mtDNA heteroplasmy due to persistence and replication of somatic mtDNA means that offspring generated by SCNT are not true clones. However, more importantly, {{the consequences of the}} presence of somatic mtDNA, mtDNA heteroplasmy, or possible incompatibility between nuclear and mtDNA genotypes on subsequent development and function of the embryo, fetus and offspring are unknown. Following sexual reproduction, mitochondrial function requires the biparental control of maternally inherited mtDNA, whereas following SCNT incompatibility between the recipient cell mitochondrial and transplanted nuclear genomes, or mtDNA heteroplasmy, may result in energy imbalance and initiate the onset of mtDNA-type disease, or disruption of normal developmental events. To remove the potentially adverse effects of somatic mtDNA following SCNT we have previously produced embryos using donor cells depleted to residual levels of mtDNA (mtDNA R). We now report that these cells support development to term and produced live lambs in which no donor somatic mtDNA was detected, the lambs being homoplasmic for recipient oocyte DNA...|$|E

Nuclear transfer (cloning) is the process of transferring a donor cell nucleus into an <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocyte.</b> The oocyte and donor cell are subsequently fused and activated to allow for nuclear reprogramming and continued development. The first objective was to determine the cloning efficiency in pigs between three activation methods. The second objective was {{to determine the effects of}} nuclear transfer on gene expression of blastocyst stage embryos and day 30 placentas and compare that to normal in vivo pregnancies. It was then determined that treatment of reconstructed pig zygotes with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, Scriptaid, returned some of the aberrantly reprogrammed transcripts to normal levels. Although gene expression was similar between the three activation groups, this study identified differentially expressed transcripts between nuclear transfer and normal in vivo embryos and placentas that will help elucidate the reprogramming errors associated with nuclear transfer in pigs...|$|E
40|$|SummaryProtamines confer {{a compact}} {{structure}} to the genome of male gametes. Here, {{we find that}} somatic cells can be remodeled by transient expression of protamine 1 (Prm 1). Ectopically expressed Prm 1 forms scattered foci in the nuclei of fibroblasts, which coalescence into spermatid-like structures, concomitant {{with a loss of}} histones and a reprogramming barrier, H 3 lysine 9 methylation. Protaminized nuclei injected into <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocytes</b> efficiently underwent protamine to maternal histone TH 2 B exchange and developed into normal blastocyst stage embryos in vitro. Altogether, our findings present a model to study male-specific chromatin remodeling, which can be exploited for the improvement of somatic cell nuclear transfer...|$|R
40|$|Mice {{have been}} cloned by nuclear {{transfer}} into <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocytes</b> {{and here we}} describe the reiterative cloning of mice to four and six generations in two independent lines. Successive generations {{showed no signs of}} prematureageing, as judged by gross behavioural parameters, and {{there was no evidence of}} shortening of telomeres at the ends of chromosomes, normally an indicator of cellular senescence — in fact, these appeared to increase slightly in length. This increase is surprising, given that the number of mitotic divisions greatly exceeds that of sexually produced animals and that any deleterious effects of cloning might be expected to be amplified in sequentially cloned mice. Our results offer a new approach to the study of organismal ageing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In Xenopus embryos, the {{successive}} and rapid cell divisions that follow fertilization {{are accompanied by}} periodic oscillations of intracellular pH (pHi). Cycling of pHi occurs in phase with several other oscillatory activities, namely nuclear divisions, M phase-promoting factor (MPF) activity, and surface contraction waves (SCWs). We report that treatments that abolish cycling of MPF activity and the SCWs also suppress the pHi oscillations, whereas those that block cell division without affecting neither MPF activity nor the SCWs do not suppress the pHi oscillations. Experiments on <b>enucleated</b> <b>oocytes,</b> matured in vitro and activated, demonstrated that the activity governing the rhythmicity of the pHi oscillations resided in the cytoplasm of the oocyte. In this respect, the activit...|$|R
