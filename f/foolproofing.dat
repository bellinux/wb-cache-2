40|$|A {{positive}} isolation disconnect {{was developed}} for component replacement in serviced liquid and gaseous spacecraft systems. Initially a survey of feasible concepts was made to determine the optimum method for fluid isolation, sealing techniques, coupling concepts, and <b>foolproofing</b> techniques. The top concepts were then further evaluated, including the fabrication of a semifunctional model. After all tradeoff analyses were made, a final configuration was designed and fabricated for development testing. This resulted in a 6. 35 mm (1 / 4 inch) line and 12. 7 mm (1 / 2 inch) line positive isolation disconnect, each unit consisting of two coupled disconnect halves, each capable of fluid isolation with essentially zero clearance between them for zero leakage upon disconnect half disengagement. An interlocking <b>foolproofing</b> technique was incorporated that prevents uncoupling of disconnect halves prior to fluid isolation...|$|E

50|$|The term {{fool proof}} {{originates}} in 1902. The term idiot proof became {{popular in the}} 1970s. It may have been invented as a stronger-sounding version of <b>foolproof,</b> as the force of <b>foolproof</b> had declined due to frequent usage. Perhaps for the same reason, 'foolproof' is now a formal term, whereas 'idiot proof' remains informal. Both terms are originally adjectives ("a <b>foolproof</b> plan"), but {{can be used as}} verbs ("foolproof this design").|$|R

40|$|<b>FOOLPROOF</b> is {{intended}} as a component toolkit for implementation of formal languages with binding structures.
