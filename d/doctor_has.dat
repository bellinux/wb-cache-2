5|$|The Doctor {{returns to}} town, and angrily drags Jex {{to face the}} Gunslinger. Amy asserts that the <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> changed for the worse from months of {{travelling}} on his own. Jex pleads that he has atoned, but the cyborg prepares to kill him. Isaac pushes Jex {{out of the way}} and takes the lethal shot. As he dies, Isaac gives the Doctor his marshal badge and has him promise to protect Mercy. The Gunslinger departs, warning he will return for Jex at noon tomorrow.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, {{the mysterious}} {{character}} River Song (Alex Kingston) summons alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) to Roman Britain in 102 AD, where underneath Stonehenge lies a fabled prison called the Pandorica that legend tells holds the most fearsome {{being in the}} whole universe. However, it is discovered that the <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> been put in a trap by an alliance of his greatest enemies to save the universe from cracks in time that were caused by the Doctor's space-time vessel the TARDIS. Amy's fiancé, Rory (Arthur Darvill), who had previously been erased from existence {{from one of the}} cracks in the universe, makes a return, though he is revealed to be an Auton duplicate outfitted with his consciousness.|$|E
5|$|River refuses the Doctor's {{offer to}} travel with him, {{returning}} to her Stormcage prison {{in order to keep}} a promise. She kisses the Doctor goodbye, and as the <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> never kissed her before she deduces that this will be her last kiss with him. In the TARDIS, Amy appears unable to remember seeing her picture in the orphanage and says that she told the Doctor, rather than Rory, when she believed she was pregnant, through fears that travelling in the TARDIS might have affected her child's development. As the trio sets off, the Doctor discreetly uses the TARDIS scanner to attempt to determine if Amy is pregnant.|$|E

5|$|While the Doctor works, Amy {{sees the}} mysterious figure again, and excuses {{herself to the}} restroom. There, the figure, {{a member of a}} species known as the Silence, waits for her and kills an {{innocent}} woman despite Amy's pleas. Realising the alien is wiping her memory of their encounters, Amy takes a picture of the alien. When she leaves the restroom, however, she yet again forgets the encounter. By then the <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> found the girl's location, a building near Cape Canaveral, Florida, at the intersection to streets named Jefferson, Adams, and Hamilton. The Doctor and his companions leave in the TARDIS, followed closely by a curious Delaware.|$|E
5|$|Amy and Rory {{discover}} that the wounded Doctor had told his earlier self to create a diversion, allowing him to rig the Pandorica to fly into the TARDIS explosion. The Doctor postulates that enough of the original universe still exists in the Pandorica to completely restore it via the exploding TARDIS. After a tearful farewell to Amy, Rory, and River where he instructs Amy to focus on her family and Rory to restore them in the new universe, the Doctor engages the Pandorica and flies it into the exploding TARDIS. A second Big Bang occurs. The Doctor comes to consciousness and begins witnessing events in his life in reverse as {{the cracks in the}} universe close. The <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> to stay outside this new universe in order for that to happen. After a final goodbye to Amelia on the night they met, he enters the cracks and disappears.|$|E
5|$|Old Kazran is soon {{visited by}} {{holographic}} {{images of the}} ship's crew in the present. After observing the effects of Abigail's singing, the crew is singing Christmas carols, the sound frequencies of which are helping to stabilise the ship but cannot prevent it from crashing. Amy appears to Kazran and implores his help, but he waves away the holograms. The Doctor appears, and Kazran surmises that he is there to show Kazran his future, {{but he could not}} care less if he dies old and alone; he reveals that Abigail had an incurable disease on entering cryostorage and will only have one more day to live. As he cannot decide which day that should be, Kazran chastises the Doctor for believing he could change his mind. Unbeknownst to Kazran, the <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> brought young Kazran with him; the realisation of how much his bitter future self now resembles his feared father causes a change of heart in Kazran (making his own memory of his future self the show's version of the ghost of Christmas yet to come), and he quickly agrees to release the controls to save the ship.|$|E

The <b>doctor</b> <b>had</b> come. The <b>doctor</b> <b>had</b> looked awfully grave. The <b>doctor</b> <b>had</b> telephoned to New York for another doctor. They were both upstairs now. It was awful, and Ruth must come at once.|$|R
5|$|The Doctor {{manages to}} contact UNIT to {{coordinate}} efforts {{of how to}} return the other passengers safely to Earth. The Doctor and Christina scout ahead, while the others attempt to repair the bus. The Doctor and Christina spot a sandstorm on the horizon when they are met by two Tritovores, a species resembling anthropomorphic flies, who take them to their wrecked spaceship. They explain they were delivering a shipment to San Helios, which had housed over hundred billion just recently but now is desert wherever they scan. The <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> them scan the approaching sandstorm and finds {{it really is a}} swarm of stingray-like aliens that are destroying the ecosystem. He suspects they are generating the wormhole to travel to their next planet to feed upon, and they must hurry and close the wormhole before they can reach Earth. Christina uses her burglary skills to obtain a power crystal and its mounting from the Tritovore ship, but accidentally wakes an alien stingray, which consumes the Tritovores.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} in the pre-dawn hours as the young Nick Adams, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a <b>doctor,</b> <b>has</b> been called out to deliver a baby {{for a woman who}} has been in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on a bottom bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a {{caesarian}} operation on the woman with a jack-knife because the baby is in the breech position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries to hold her down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor during the operation. Nick is sent out of the cabin, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his father on the lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father questions about birth and death, and thinks to himself that he will never die, as he watches his father row.|$|E
5|$|The story {{involved}} a strange force compelling Jamie to pilot the TARDIS to Scotland in 1746 where the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe find themselves isolated from their ship by a forcefield. They {{arrive at the}} foreboding Castle McCrimmon, Jamie's ancestral home near a misty loch. There they are met by Duncan, Factor to the ailing Laird, Sir James McCrimmon. Jamie shows Zoe around and she notices some strange cattle which then stand up - they are Yeti. The Yeti isolate the castle and the villagers fall {{under the influence of}} the Great Intelligence. One villager, Fiona, is immune and Jamie falls in love with her. The Intelligence aims to gain control of Jamie's body and settle in the castle as the Laird of McCrimmon when Sir James dies. The <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> to determine who the Intelligence is working through, with the Laird and the village sorceress being the prime candidates. It transpires that Duncan is protecting Fiona's mother, Morag - a woman with second sight. The Intelligence is defeated and, after Sir James dies with no heirs, Jamie is the last of the clan and is therefore the obvious choice for the new Laird. Accepting his rightful inheritance and responsibility, Jamie bids a reluctant farewell to the Doctor and Zoe to remain with Fiona as the new Laird.|$|E

5|$|If {{the player}} saved Curly Brace earlier, the player may find an item to restore her memories. She remembers that the player character's name is Quote, {{and that they}} were not the killer robots who {{slaughtered}} Mimigas in the past. Instead, they were sent to destroy the Demon Crown to prevent its power from falling into the wrong hands. Quote finds Sue's mother, Momorin, who is building a rocket that will allow access {{to the top of the}} island where the Doctor resides. After helping her complete the rocket, Quote confronts Misery and the Doctor. The <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> purified the essence of the red flowers into a crystal, which allows him to survive even after Quote destroys his body. The Doctor's spirit possesses the Core of the island, but Quote succeeds in destroying that as well, causing the island to begin falling to Earth. Should the player have saved Curly and restored her memories, they may proceed into a bonus stage called the Bloodstained Sanctuary where Curly can be found and rescued; it is also here that Ballos - creator of the Demon Crown and Jenka's younger brother - is imprisoned. A powerful wizard who went insane and destroyed his homeland after being tortured by a jealous king, Ballos was sealed deep within the island by his sister. At some point, his niece Misery forced him to create the demon crown, but she and Balrog became cursed to serve whoever possessed it. Additionally, it is stated via narration that the Demon Crown will repair itself if it is destroyed, and will only truly lose its power if Ballos is killed, necessitating that Quote and Curly take his life.|$|E
5|$|Misery banishes {{the player}} to the Labyrinth {{deep inside the}} island as {{punishment}} for interfering with the Doctor's plans. Curly Brace has also been thrown into the Labyrinth and they cooperate to escape. Balrog helps them to move the boulder blocking the exit, revealing his kind nature. The pair find and defeat the Core, a magical creature whose power keeps the island afloat. However, the Doctor steps in to save it before the island collapses. Depending on certain conditions, the player may rescue Curly Brace, who had sacrificed her air tank to save the player character. When he returns to Mimiga Village, he finds that the <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> captured the Mimigas. In the Egg Corridor, Kazuma offers the player a choice to escape the island with him using a Sky Dragon, leading to an alternate ending in which the Doctor conquers the surface world while Kazuma and the player hide in the mountains. The player may instead choose to confront the Doctor and destroy the island's Core, which would return the Mimigas to normal. The player scales the outer wall of the island to reach the Plantation where the Doctor is using the Mimigas as slave laborers to grow red flowers. The Doctor's servants capture the player and place him in a jail cell with Sue. She is taken away before the player wakes up, but her letter reveals that the Doctor {{was a member of}} the research expedition that included Sue's family and Professor Booster, but he betrayed them once he found the Demon Crown. Sue directs the player to find her mother who may have a plan to stop the Doctor.|$|E
