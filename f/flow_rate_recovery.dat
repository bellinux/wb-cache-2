40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate the application uniformity of subsurface drip distribution systems and the recovery of emitter flow rates. Emission volume in the field, and laboratory measured flow rates were determined for emitters from three locations. Additionally, the effects of lateral orientation with respect to slope on emitter plugging was evaluated. Two different emitters were tested to evaluate slope effects on emitter plugging (type Y and Z). The emitters were alternately spliced together and installed in an up and down orientation on slopes of 0, 1, 2 and 4 % and along the contour on slopes of 1 and 2 %. The emitters were covered with soil and underwent a simulated year of dosing cycles, and then flushed with a flushing velocity of 0. 6 m/s. Initial flow rates for the two emitter types were 2. 38 L/hr with a C. V. of 0. 07. There {{was no significant difference in}} flow rates among slopes for type Y emitters, but there was a significant difference between the 1 % and 2 % contour slopes for type Z emitters. Application uniformity of three different laterals at each site was evaluated. Sections of the lateral from the beginning, middle and end were excavated and emission volumes were recorded for each emitter. Application uniformity of laterals ranged from 48. 69 to 9. 49 %, 83. 55 to 72. 60 %, and 44. 41 to 0 % for sites A, B, and C, respectively. Mean emitter flow rate was 2. 21, 2. 24, and 2. 56 L/hr for sites A, B, and C, respectively under laboratory conditions. Application uniformity under laboratory conditions ranged from 70. 97 to 14. 91 %, 86. 67 to 79. 99 %, and 85. 04 to 0. 00 % for sites A, B, and C, respectively. A flushing velocity of 0. 15 m/s with no chlorination, shock chlorination of 3400 mg/L and flushing velocity of 0. 15 m/s, and shock chlorination of 3400 mg/L and flushing velocity of 0. 6 m/s treatment regiments were applied to all laterals collected to assess emitter <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> <b>recovery</b> to the nominal flow rate published by the manufacturer. All laterals showed an increase in the number of emitters within 10 % of the published nominal flow rate...|$|E
40|$|As it is known, {{different}} {{maintenance and}} rehabilitation activities are conducted in oil & gas wells {{so as to}} ensure optimal <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>recovery</b> volume, well safety and integrity. In doing all these activities, well intervention companies are highly dependent on the performance and reliability of wireline cables. However, senior technical people at Altus Intervention (formerly called Aker Well Service) have identified {{the presence of a}} miss-match between the performance of the currently available wireline cables (specially the 5 / 16 ″ - monoconductor cable) and the demand of a well intervention task as wells goes deeper, deviated, and acidic. For these reasons, the company has initiated this project work so as to look for the improvement potential of the currently used monoconductor cables. In order to pinpoint the limitations of the currently used cables, I have conducted a thorough discussion with senior technical people at Altus Intervention, extracted relevant information and data from the company’s Synergy page, participated in different wireline training courses, and also conduct relevant literature review. Overall, the inherent limitations of the currently used 5 / 16 ″ cables are found to originate from their limited strength, relatively heavy weight, integrity of the insulation material, and poor H 2 S resistance of the steel (high strength version) armor. Moreover, operational related problems such as gas breakthrough, development of kinks and bird nesting, and also the cost of corrosion resistance grades of the cable are found to be leading problems. Thus, formulating a new design approach so as to address these limitations either fully or partially was the main theme of this project work. In an attempt to solve these limitations, I have used a new design approach which effectively combines high strength Kevlar® 49 fiber with abrasion resistance and electrical conducting steel armor wire. The new approach is found to have a higher prospect towards reducing the cable weight, improving the breaking strength, fatigue life, and alleviating short circuiting and other common problems of the currently used 5 / 16 "- monoconductor cables. Furthermore, the conformance of the new concept cable to the harsh well environment, working condition, and operational demand of the well intervention task is also investigated using scientific data, mathematical modeling, software simulation, and other techniques. Though all the results found are highly encouraging, I strongly recommend the development of a prototype cable and undertake all the relevant tests so as to review the conformance of the new cable to the actual working condition. Developing a tailored inspection technique for this concept cable and also extending the concept towards other cable grades are identified as continuation works of this project work. Furthermore, the possibility of finding non-steel based but abrasion resistance materials so as to fully replace the entire armor wire is also sighted as possible and fascinating research topic as this further helps to reduce the cable weight...|$|E

The marker perfusion technique employed was shown, in preliminary experiments, to measure accurately jejunal and ileal fluid and electrolyte transmucosal transport rates under conditions of cholera diarrhea. Fluid loss into the lumen occurred from jejunal and ileal mucosa. The fluid was isotonic in both regions. Bicarbonate concentration was significantly higher in ileal than jejunal fluid during all phases of the disease. Bicarbonate concentration in both regions was significantly higher in acute cholera than during convalescence. Fluid loss into the intestinal lumen ranged from 0. 07 to 10. 9 ml/hr per cm. Losses were significantly greater from jejunum than ileum. Net ileal absorption was recorded in five of 10 acute cholera studies.

Pulse {{electrochemical}} machining (PECM) provides an economical and effective method for machining high strength, heat-resistant materials into complex shapes such as turbine blades, die, molds and micro cavities.

40|$|In this work, I {{present the}} {{development}} of analytical solutions in the Laplace domain for a fully-penetrating, horizontal well producing at a constant <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> or constant wellbore pressure {{in the center of}} a composite, cylindrical reservoir system with an impermeable outer boundary. The composite reservoir consists of two regions. The cylindrical region closest to the wellbore is stimulated, and the permeability within this region follows a power-law function of the radial distance from the wellbore. The unstimulated outer region has homogeneous reservoir properties. The current norm for successful stimulation of low permeability reservoir rocks is multi-stage hydraulic fracturing. The process of hydraulic fracturing creates thin, high permeability fractures that propagate deep into the reservoir, increasing the area of the rock matrix that is exposed to this low-resistance flow pathway. The large surface area of the high conductivity fracture is what makes hydraulic fracturing so successful. Unfortunately, hydraulic fracturing is often encumbered by problems such as high capital costs and a need for large volumes of water. Therefore, I investigate a new stimulation concept based upon the alteration of the permeability of a large volume around the producing well assembly from its original regime to that following a power-law function. I evaluate the effectiveness of the new concept by comparing it to conventional multi-stage hydraulic fracturing. The results of this investigation show that the power-law permeability reservoir (PPR) has a performance advantage over the multi-fractured horizontal treatment (MFH) only when the fracture conductivity and fracture half-length are small. Most importantly, the results demonstrate that the PPR can provide respectable <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> and <b>recovery</b> factors, thus making it a viable stimulation concept for ultra-low permeability reservoirs, especially under conditions that may not be conducive to a conventional MHF treatment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} recent research {{carried out by the}} authors on the development and analysis of mathematical models describing hydrogen production in membrane reactors. The case considered is that of methane steam reforming (SR) in a reactor with the typical double pipe configuration, in which a hydrogen-permeable membrane is present on the outer wall of the innermost tube. The model developed accounts for the rate of reaction, convective and dispersive transport in the axial and radial directions, and hydrogen permeation across the membrane. Density variations with pressure and gas composition have been accounted for, leading to a full coupling of mass and momentum transport. Different geometric aspect ratios have also been studied to assess the influence of catalyst volume on the overall performance of the system. The presence of two distinct transport regimes, in which hydrogen permeation is limited either by transport within the packed bed or permeation across the membrane, has been identified, along with the operating conditions that determine their range of existence. This has allowed the development of a simplified model, valid under the hypothesis that the reaction is fast compared to transport. In the permeation-controlled regime, the permeate <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>recovery</b> may be found by solving a set of two PDEs, whereas an analytical solution is available for the transport-controlled regime.

40|$|The rotary reactor {{differs from}} most {{alternative}} chemical looping combustion (CLC) reactor designs because it maintains near-thermal equilibrium {{between the two}} stages of the redox process by thermally coupling channels undergoing oxidation and reduction. An earlier study showed that this thermal coupling between the oxidation and reduction reactors increases the efficiency by up to 2 % points when implemented in a regenerative Brayton cycle. The present study extends this analysis to alternative CLC cycles {{with the objective of}} identifying optimal configurations and design tradeoffs. Results show that the increased efficiency from reactor thermal coupling applies only to cycles that are capable of exploiting the increased availability in the reduction reactor exhaust. Thus, in addition to the regenerative cycle, the combined CLC cycle and the combined-regenerative CLC cycle are suitable for integration with the rotary reactor. Parametric studies are used to compare the sensitivity of the different cycle efficiencies to parameters like pressure ratio, turbine inlet temperature, carrier-gas fraction and purge steam generation. One of the key conclusions from this analysis is that while the optimal efficiency for regenerative CLC cycle was the highest of the three (56 % at 3 bars, 1200 °C), the combined-regenerative cycle offers a trade-off that combines a reasonably high efficiency (about 54 % at 12 bars, 1200 °C) with much lower gas volumetric <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and consequently, smaller reactor size. Unlike the other two cycles, the optimal compressor pressure ratio for the regenerative cycle is weakly dependent on the design turbine inlet temperature.

In this investigation, the major salivary glands and the oral mucosa were studied, and their role as participants in the excretion of coxsackievirus B- 1 during viremia was evaluated. The effect of the salivary-gland stimulant pilocarpine nitrate on both the salivary <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and the <b>recovery</b> of virus during viremia was determined. A comparison was made {{between the amount of}} virus recovered from whole saliva during viremia in animals deficient in {{one or both of the}} major salivary-gland pairs and animals with a complete complement of salivary glands. The salivary glands in other animals were cannulated, and pure glandular secretions were collected during viremia and assayed for the presence of virus The amount of virus passing from the capillaries of the oral mucosa to the surface was also determined to evaluate this route as a possible site for the excretion of virus into saliva during viremia. The major salivary glands did not excrete appreciable quantities of virus during viremia. The submaxillary-gland secretions did not contain virus, and the parotid-gland secretions showed virus only at extremely high blood virus levels. Either removal of the major salivary glands or decreased salivary <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> increased the concentration of virus in whole saliva. This observation suggested that the production of saliva by the major salivary glands tends to dilute the virus in the oral cavity. A 0. 88 -cm 2 sample of the oral mucosa excreted significantly large amounts of virus during viremia and suggested that the passage of virus through the oral mucosa was the major route for the excretion of virus into saliva during viremia...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} heart rate fall after treadmill exercise testing, or heart <b>rate</b> <b>recovery,</b> {{as a powerful}} predictor of mortality from heart disease. Heart <b>rate</b> <b>recovery</b> depends on central reactivation of vagal tone and decreased vagal activity is {{a risk factor for}} death. If heart <b>rate</b> <b>recovery</b> is defined as the fall in heart rate after 1 minute following peak exercise, then a heart <b>rate</b> <b>recovery</b> value of 12 beats per minute (bpm) or lower {{has been shown to be}} a good prognostic threshold for identifying patients at high risk. Although this finding establishes a simple, useful relationship between heart recovery and mortality, a working understanding of how heart <b>rate</b> <b>recovery</b> interacts with other characteristics of a patient in determining risk of death is still largely unexplored. Such knowledge, addressed in this article, could improve the prognostic value of the exercise test. Our analysis is based on over 23, 000 patients who underwent exercise testing. A rich assortment of data was collected on these patients, including clinical and physiological information, heart <b>rate</b> <b>recovery,</b> and other exercise test performance measures. Our approach was to grow relative risk forests, a novel method that combines random forest methodology with survival trees grown using Poisson likelihoods.

This paper discusses the enhancement of weir skimmer capacity on spill oil recovery by introducing a tangential water jet along the inside bottom of a weir chamber. The jet creates a strong, stable vortex inside the weir. The weir skimmer oil <b>recovery</b> <b>rate</b> increased as the water jet <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> increases, the oil viscosity decreases and film thickness increases. The maximum oil <b>recovery</b> <b>rate</b> was attained when the weir crest was at the same level as the oil/water separation surface.

40|$|Conventional low {{temperature}} thermal desalination (LTTD) uses ocean thermal temperature gradients {{to drive a}} single stage flash distillation process to produce pure water from seawater. While the temperature difference in the ocean drives distillation and provides cooling in LTTD, external electrical energy is required to pump the water streams from the ocean and to maintain a near vacuum in the flash chamber. In this work, an LTTD process from the literature is compared against, the thermodynamic least work and the minimum least work possible for the system, reverse osmosis (RO) and membrane distillation (MD), an alternative thermal desalination technology. In all cases compared, the product water <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> feed seawater inlet temperatures and cold seawater inlet conditions were held constant. Exergy and Second law analysis showed that for the LTTD system studied, under reversible operating conditions with no heat exchange with the atmosphere, a power production of 26 kWh/m 3 of product water was possible. At near zero recoveries (infinite warm feed <b>flow</b> <b>rates)</b> or allowing heat exchange with an infinite ambient at the warm water temperature, maximum power production possible was found to increase to 75 kWh/m 3. In contrast, the LTTD system in literature was found to consume 22 kWh/m 3 while standard seawater RO consumes 2. 3 kWh/m 3. MD {{was found to be}} an effective alternative LTTD technology. Switching to MD from flash distillation eliminates the need for vacuum pumps and also reduces the pumping power consumption by reducing both the required cool and warm water <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> through increased <b>recovery</b> ratios. Furthermore, pressure drops in the condenser on the cool side and the requirement of pumping brine back to atmospheric pressure from a near vacuum in a conventional LTTD flash chamber are avoided. The proposed LTMD system can potentially perform competitively with RO by operating with a specific power consumption less than 2. 5 kWh/m 3, while retaining the environmental benefits of the conventional LTTD system.

A short-pulse technique {{was used for}} measuring particle recovery and collision efficiencies in two porous media (silica gravel and glass beads). Breakthrough curves (BTCs) were measured on-line and well described by analytical solution of an advective-dispersive equation with a first-order deposition kinetic. The effects of hydrodynamic and gravity forces on particle transport and deposition rate were delineated. Results show particles travelling faster than the conservative tracer.
