25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor {{to a lot of}} us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken that most of us turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. I <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> because Both was never up before then. They told me the news. I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. But I kept thinking of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E
500|$|A {{few members}} of Cho's family, those who {{remained}} in South Korea, had concerns about his behavior during his early childhood. Cho's relatives {{thought that he was}} selectively mute or mentally ill. According to Cho's uncle, Cho [...] "didn't say much and did not mix with other children." [...] Cho's maternal great-aunt described Cho as [...] "cold" [...] and a cause of family concern from as young as eight years old. According to his great-aunt, who met him twice, Cho was extremely shy and [...] "just would not talk at all." [...] He was otherwise considered [...] "well-behaved," [...] readily obeying verbal commands and cues. The great-aunt said she <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> after the family's departure for the United States because she heard frequent updates about Cho's older sister but little news about Cho. During an ABC News Nightline interview on August 30, 2007, Cho's grandfather reported his concerns about Cho's behavior during childhood. According to Cho's grandfather, Cho never looked up to him to make eye contact, never called him grandfather, and never moved to embrace him.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a little}} after 4:00, Officer Simonsen phoned Warden Powell, who was {{across the street at}} his residence. [...] Simonsen told the warden there was a {{disturbance}} inside the prison and that someone had been knifed. [...] Under duress from Myles and Smart, the officer told the warden little else, and Powell rushed through Tower 7 along with two guards to see what the [...] "disturbance" [...] was. [...] As soon as he entered Inside Administration, he was yanked through the doorway. [...] His escort realized something was wrong and retreated, escaping back through Tower 7. [...] The guards on top of this tower <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> and had tried to warn the warden, but the blustery spring wind had obliterated their words.|$|E

Please {{look for}} {{up-to-date}} {{information in the}} OSU Extension Catalog: [URL] children break bones or get fevers, they <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong.</b> Often, however, they don’t know what it is, why it is, how it happened, or if they will get better. Because they’re in pain and know so little, illness and injury can be very frightening...|$|R

2500|$|Several of Desmond's lines, such as, [...] "All right Mr. DeMille, I'm {{ready for}} my close-up," [...] and [...] "I am big, it's the {{pictures}} that got small!" [...] are often quoted. Much of the film's wit is delivered through Norma Desmond's deadpan comments, which are often followed by sarcastic retorts from Gillis. Desmond appears to not hear some of these comments, as she is absorbed by her own thoughts and in denial, and so some of Gillis's lines are heard only by the audience, with Wilder blurring {{the line between the}} events and Gillis's narration. Gillis's response to Desmond's cry that [...] "the pictures got small" [...] is a muttered reply, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> with them". Wilder often varies the structure, with Desmond taking Gillis's comments seriously and replying in kind. For example, when the two discuss the overwrought script Desmond has been working on, Gillis observes, [...] "They'll love it in Pomona." [...] "They'll love it everyplace," [...] replies Desmond firmly.|$|E

Greenlee agrees, and they begin {{secretly}} plotting to take David down for his blackmail. Madison becomes upset about the time Ryan spends with Greenlee, and Ryan tries his best to assure her, despite still having feelings for Greenlee.|$|R

We must have <b>known</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> with us or we wouldn't have ordered any survey...Why spend valuable time now looking at what may <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> with Mr. Cheney? It would be more profitable for each of us to dig out of the report the mass of useful and interesting information, new information, and the many useful and definite suggestions." [...] Alfred A. Knopf, Sr.|$|R
50|$|Later, Vulko {{is helping}} the {{seafarers}} to fish when another man shows him the corpse of an Atlantean soldier.

He introduces himself to the Justice League and asks for Aquaman before collapsing. The Justice League brings Vulko to the Watchtower and contact Aquaman. Vulko informs them that Ocean Master is waging war on the surface.|$|R

[...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> with me, and now I {{can see that}} my side is dented in so that I lean over toward the left. It was the Soldier's fault; he shouldn't have been so careless." ...|$|E
6000|$|She had {{probably}} {{made a mistake}} about that, for after they had gone far enough to have reached the camp they still found themselves {{in the thick of}} the woods. So the little girl stopped short and looked around her, and Toto glanced up into her face with his bright little eyes and wagged his tail as if he <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> He couldn't tell much about direction himself, because he had spent his time prowling among the bushes and running here and there; nor had Billina paid much attention to where they were going, being interested in picking bugs from the moss as they passed along. The Yellow Hen now turned one eye up toward the little girl and asked: ...|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing {{the album}} in Rolling Stone, Steve Futterman judged it [...] "Neither triumphant {{resurgence}} nor embarrassing failure". He elaborated that the album successfully recreates the funky grooves of [...] "the classic Family Stone sound" [...] but lacks the sociopolitical immediacy that the band {{had in their}} heyday. He concluded, [...] "When a once politically astute pop statesman writes an ode to New Jersey called 'Hobo Ken,' you <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong.</b> But if you crave the beat, you'll find it here ..." ...|$|R

50|$|The Doctor <b>knows</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong,</b> as {{the monsters}} {{do not appear}} to be the product of a normal {{evolutionary}} process. He traces an interference signal to the abandoned lighthouse on Black Island. Exploring the island with an eccentric local woman, Bronwyn, the Doctor finds an 'interstellar space-hopper' and, in the lamp room of the lighthouse, a psychic transmitter/receiver. Understanding that this is causing the children's nightmares, in turn realising the monsters they dream about, the Doctor is reluctant to dismantle the machine and risk damaging the children. He cannot reach the controls of the telepathic circuits as they are underneath the machine.|$|R
60|$|In the {{haste to}} get supper we all took a hand, and some one threw upon our {{tarpaulin}} tablecloth a tin cup of butter mixed with carbolic acid--a concoction Jones {{had used to}} bathe the sore feet of the dogs. Of course I got hold of this, spread a generous portion on my hot biscuit, placed some red-hot beans on that, and began to eat like a hungry hunter. At first I thought I was only burned. Then I recognized the taste and burn of the acid and <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> Picking up the tin, I examined it, smelled the pungent odor and felt a queer numb sense of fear. This lasted only for a moment, as I well knew the use {{and power of the}} acid, and had not swallowed enough to hurt me. I was about to make known my mistake in a matter-of-fact way, when it flashed over me the accident could be made to serve a turn.|$|E
6000|$|Ellams paused, {{and looked}} {{thoughtful}} when he resumed: [...] "I can't altogether make things plain; {{there was a}} feeling of insecurity, and Wyndham's moodiness got worse. He did not go away so much, and locked his room door at night. I think he did not sleep and took some draught; not drugs white men use, but stuff the negroes make. When he did sleep, he was strangely hard to rouse. He was cool and as nearly fearless as any man I knew, but he began to look haggard and start at unexpected sounds. One morning I could not wake him and went round to the veranda window. Wyndham was fast asleep and a gun lay across his bed. He was a good shot with a pistol, but this was a heavy duck-gun that threw an ounce and a quarter of shot. Well, I was getting nervy, and the factory boys would not stop--it looked as if they <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> I began to wonder how long Wyndham could keep it up." ...|$|E

In 2002, media reports claimed {{she was also}} suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Doctors later discovered she actually had Lewy body dementia; both the Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diagnoses were incorrect. Golden Girls cast members who attempted {{to talk to her}} on the phone or in person found that she couldn't remember them, or anything about the show. Bea Arthur said that even during production of the series, Getty had so much trouble remembering her lines that they should have <b>known</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> from the beginning.|$|R

Score Magazine, gave it 2 out of 5 stars stating, [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> with an album when the instrumental tracks immensely outshine the vocal tracks. I must mention that each of the songs has a strong underlying melody but gross injustice is done to them by Shirish Kunder's lyrics." ...|$|R
