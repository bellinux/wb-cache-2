40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Fusion</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Agreement's</b> {{mission for}} JET is the {{development}} of ITER scenarios exploiting the specific properties of the device. This task requires significant improvements in the measuring techniques. The most innovative diagnostic upgrades are in the fields of edge measurements, detection of fast magnetohydrodynamics modes and "burning plasma" diagnostics. The importance of plasma-wall interactions, and, in particular, the issue of tritium inventory promoted the development of the quartz microbalance, a detector with improved time resolution to measure material redeposition in the remote areas of the inner divertor. Measurement of Alfven cascades with unprecedented spectral resolution, reaching a toroidal n number of up to 16, was obtained using an O-mode microwave reflectometer as an interferometer. For the diagnosis of the fusion products, a new approach is being developed to measure the He ash based on double charge exchange between thermalized particles and neutrals from JET beams. There have been several upgrades of the neutron diagnostic systems, one of which, the new time of flight neutron spectrometer designed for high counting rates is described.

40|$|The {{irradiation}} project HFR phase 1 b {{was planned}} {{and carried out}} in the frame of the <b>European</b> Long-term <b>Fusion</b> Materials <b>Development</b> Programme. It represents the continuation of the former High-Flux-Reactor irradiation programmes which are documented in detail in former FZK-reports. The problem of the irradiation induced embrittlement of possible martensitic alloy candidates is still not finally solved. After evaluation of sub-size Charpy tests with the 2. 4 dpa irradiated specimens, the low activation 7 - 10 %-Cr-W(Ge) VTa alloys showed outstandingly better characteristics compared to the modified commercial 10 - 11 %-Cr-NiMoVNb steels. The emphasis of the phase 1 b project is now on the investigation of low activating OPTIFER-alloys, which exhibit in contrast to the previously irradiated OPTIFER-steels a clearly reduced boron content {{in order to reduce the}} irradiation embrittlement. In the present report the results of instrumented impact tests within the phase 1 b programme (irradiation dose 2. 4 dpa, irradiation temperatures 250, 300, 350, 400, and 450 C) are analysed and assessed in comparison to the results of the MANITU- and HFR phase 1 a-irradiation programmes. Herein, the OPTIFER-V steel, which is nearly identical to the industrial heat EUROFER 97 (which became available after the irradiation), supplied the best results. (orig.)

40|$|The {{irradiation}} project MANITU {{was planned}} {{and carried out}} in the frame of the <b>European</b> long-term <b>fusion</b> materials <b>development</b> programme. The problem of the irradiation induced embrittlement of possible martensitic alloy candidates is still unsolved. But after the evaluation of sub-size Charpy tests with the unirradiated reference specimens of MANITU a first tendency was recognizable. The mechanical properties of the newly developed low activation 7 - 10 % Cr-W(Ge) VTa alloys are partly better compared to the modified commercial 10 - 11 % Cr-NiMoVNb steels. After the evaluation of subsize Charpy tests with specimens irradiated up to 0. 2 and 0. 8 dpa in {{the first phase of the}} MANITU programme, better mechanical properties of the 7 - 10 % Cr-W(Ge) VTa alloys were obvious. In the present report the results of instrumented impact tests within the second phase of the MANITU programme (irradiation dose 2. 4 dpa, irradiation temperatures 250, 300, 350, 400, and 450 C) are analysed and assessed in comparison to the results of the irradiation up to 0. 2 and 0. 8 dpa in the first phase of the project. Among the examined alloys (MANET-I/II, K-Heat, OPTIFER-Ia/II, F 82 H, ORNL 3791) the ORNL steel shows the very best embrittlement behaviour after neutron irradiation. (orig.)

40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>fusion</b> {{programme}} is “reactor oriented ” and it {{is aimed}} at the successive demonstration of the scientific, the technological and the economic feasibility of fusion power. For a reactor-oriented <b>fusion</b> <b>development</b> programme, {{it is essential to}} have a clear idea of the ultimate goal of the programme, namely a series of models of fusion power plants, in order to define the correct strategy and to assess the pertinence of the on-going activities. The European Power Plant Conceptual Study (PPCS) has been a study of conceptual designs for commercial fusion power plants. It focused on five power plant models, named PPCS A, B, AB, C and D, which are illustrative of a wider spectrum of possibilities. They are all based on the tokamak concept and they have approximately the same net electrical power output, 1500 MWe. These span a range from relatively near-term, based on limited technology and plasma physics extrapolations, to an advanced conception. All five PPCS plant models differ substantially from the models that formed the basis of earlier European studies. They also differ from one another, which lead to differences in economic performance and in the details of safety and environmental impacts. The main emphasis of the PPCS was on system integration.
