5|$|Never shall I <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> night, {{the first}} night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky.|$|E
5|$|Never shall I <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> nocturnal silence which {{deprived}} me, for all eternity, of {{the desire}} to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.|$|E
5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E

60|$|However, {{the king}} derived great {{happiness}} from his beloved Christina. It {{must have been}} a pleasant sight to see the powerful monarch of Sweden playing in some magnificent hall of the palace with his merry little girl. Then he <b>forgot</b> <b>that</b> the weight of a kingdom rested upon his shoulders. He <b>forgot</b> <b>that</b> the wise Chancellor Oxenstiern was waiting to consult with him how to render Sweden the greatest nation of Europe. He <b>forgot</b> <b>that</b> the Emperor of Germany and the King of France were plotting together how they might pull him down from his throne.|$|R
5|$|The landed {{aristocracy}} of Spanish descent {{considered the}} illiterate, mixed-race gauchos, who comprised {{the majority of}} the population, to be ungovernable and untrustworthy. The gauchos were tolerated because there was no other labor force available, but were treated with contempt by the landowners. Rosas got along well with the gauchos in his service, despite his harsh and authoritarian comportment. He was known to dress like them, joke with them, take part in their horse-play, and pay them well, but he never allowed them to <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> he was their master rather than their equal. Shaped by the colonial society in which he lived, Rosas was conservative, an advocate of hierarchy and authority, like the other great landowners in the region.|$|E
5|$|The main {{legacy of}} the SSR Abkhazia is that it created, {{for the first time}} in modern history, a defined {{geographic}} entity under the name Abkhazia. The Abkhaz people were cognizant of their republic and its quasi-independent status, and though it was removed in 1931 they did not <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> it had existed. The SSR Abkhazia would take a prominent role during the glasnost and perestroika era of the late 1980s, as Abkhaz leaders called for their state to once again be formed and break away from Georgia, citing the SSR Abkhazia as a precedent. This led to them restoring the 1925 SSR Abkhazian constitution, which ultimately led to the 1992–1993 war between Abkhazia and Georgia, and the modern Abkhaz–Georgian conflict.|$|E

25|$|The {{enemy is}} anybody who's {{going to get}} you killed, no matter which side he's on, and that {{includes}} Colonel Cathcart. And don't you <b>forget</b> <b>that,</b> because the longer you remember it, the longer you might live.|$|E
25|$|Shade: shade is an {{art form}} that {{developed}} from Reading. Rather than the aim to insult, someone works with the medium of backhanded compliments. An example is to suggest that someone's beautiful dress makes people almost <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> she has a five o'clock shadow.|$|E
25|$|Organizations need {{to realize}} that {{internal}} dissent is not itself a crisis, but rather priceless insurance against disaster. Until the ugly headlines appear and the consequences are unavoidable, companies too often <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> they will suffer far more for ignoring their principled dissendents than by giving them a hearing (Bennis, 2004).|$|E

25|$|I {{think of}} those in {{religious}} orders {{and some of the}} clergy in Dublin who have to face these facts from their past, which instinctively and quite naturally they’d rather not look at. That takes courage, and also we shouldn’t <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> this account today will also overshadow all of the good that they also did.|$|E
25|$|The text {{gives no}} {{apparent}} reason for the name in its literal meaning. Adam and his colleagues themselves seem to have thought the name to derive from the legendary Amazons taken from classical Greek mythology. This is clearly said in the text itself to be their own thinking, even though Adam later in his publication seems to <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> and presents it as a common rumor originating from bishop Adalvard.|$|E
25|$|Could I <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> {{the event}} in St. Peter's Square {{took place on the}} day and at the hour when the first {{appearance}} of the Mother of Christ to the poor little peasants has been remembered for over sixty years at Fátima, Portugal? For in everything that happened to me on that very day, I felt that extraordinary motherly protection and care, {{which turned out to be}} stronger than the deadly bullet.|$|E

25|$|I {{wanted to}} do {{something}} refreshing and different, so I mixed genres and drew inspiration from touring, traveling, watching rock bands, and attending festivals… I was like a mad scientist, putting lots of different songs together. Boyz II Men were the first ones to put Destiny's Child on tour. They showed us how to treat an opening act and I will never <b>forget</b> <b>that.</b> That was 15 years ago! Wow, 15 years! I'm old.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the musical}} views of The Five {{tended to be}} anti-German, {{it is easy to}} <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> Balakirev was {{actually}} well-grounded in German symphonic style—all the more impressive when it is remembered that Balakirev was essentially self-taught as a composer. His King Lear overture, written when he was 22, is not a symphonic poem in the vein of Liszt but actually more along the lines of Beethoven's concert overtures, relying more on the dramatic qualities of sonata form than on extramusical content.|$|E
25|$|Looking at Head's {{life and}} the clearly {{scientific}} route that it took, it is often easy to <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> he was also to become a poet. Through his mother he had gained a love of literature and this would do much to direct his choice of acquaintances in later life when he was to become firm friends with authors (most notably to Thomas Hardy) and a mentor to the poet Siegfried Sassoon. This passion was also to initiate another, as in literature he and his future wife Ruth (a writer in her own right) were to find common ground.|$|E

25|$|Thirdly, covetousness is {{the third}} worldly evil, which {{is also known as}} lust. Colet calls this a plague that has {{overtaken}} many priests and blinded many. Many take part in the Church only for the hope of riches and promotions. Priests <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> they should be interested in the good they can do more than the amount of riches that they stand to gain. Paul called covetousness the root of all evils. From it, benefices stack up, including pensions and tithes. Colet states that: “every corruption, all the ruin of the Church, all the scandals of the world, come from the covetousness of priests”.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} of Guizot’s oration was his straightforward style of speaking. He {{was essentially a}} ministerial speaker, far more powerful in defence than in opposition. Nor was he less a master of parliamentary tactics and of those sudden changes and movements in debate which, as in a battle, sometimes change the fortune of the day. His confidence in himself, and {{in the majority of}} the chamber which he had moulded to his will, was unbounded; and long success and the habit of authority led him to <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> in a country like France there was a people outside the chamber elected by a small constituency, to which the minister and the king himself were held responsible.|$|E
25|$|I cannot <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> {{ever since}} I {{was a child}} Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, and {{the person in the}} world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have known him for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. I think they have all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more to me than I do to them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E
