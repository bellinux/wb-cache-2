40|$|Abstract — Media {{streaming}} {{applications are}} becoming {{very popular in}} the Internet world. Since they mainly rely on a not scalable client/server model, the P 2 P model is receiving more and more attention as a system to provide media streaming. Different P 2 P media streaming systems are available, but today the most successful approach seems the chunk-driven P 2 P model. In such system, the basic assumption is that the media file is divided into several chunks/segments and while playing a segment, the client downloads the following one(s). However, since P 2 P networks offer no guarantees to the supported applications, <b>inter-segments</b> playout interruption might disruptively affect the perceived playout quality. To mitigate this, we propose a novel approach that uses both low-level audio and video information to divide the video in stand-alone segments. Using real P 2 P bandwidth aggregate data traffic and a trace-driven simulation, an objective and a subjective evaluation show that if the underlying P 2 P network causes <b>inter-segments</b> playout delay, the perceived playout quality is less affected if our approach is employed.

Objects generated from this type of segmentation hold additional attributes such as mean values per spectral band, distances to neighbouring objects, size, and texture, as well as shape characteristics. However, the accuracy of these high level features depends on the choice of segmentation scale parameters. Several studies have investigated techniques for scale parameter selection. These proposed approaches do not consider the different objects’ size variability found in complex scenes such as urban scene as they rely upon arbitrary object size measures, introducing instability errors when computing image variances.

It is a key step in the IC applications regarding cryptography, security, and digital rights management. However, GLC is challenging due to unpredictable process variations, gate correlations, and difficulties to scale to large designs. We have developed a new approach for hardware and system security using consistency-based GLC and statistical analysis. In particular, we first conduct input vector control, test point insertion, and thermal conditioning to impose extra variations to the IC properties and break the correlations among gates. Then, we partition the circuit into small segments and characterize the gate-level IC properties in each segment. Finally, we employ statistical methods to analyze the consistency of the gate-level properties, both intra- and <b>inter-segments,</b> to identify and diagnose malicious modifications (e. g., hardware Trojans) or other misconduct (e. g., IC counterfeiting) made by an adversary. Based on our research findings in the consistency-based GLC, we develop a group of hardware security applications, including (1) hardware Trojan detection and diagnosis; (2) hardware metering and digital rights management; and (3) remote and in-field wireless security.

S., UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST Directed by: Dr. Joseph Hamill There is an {{increased}} risk for ipsilateral graft rupture and contralateral ACL rupture following ACL reconstruction surgery (ACLR) despite return to sport clearance. The reason for this increased risk is not well understood. Previous literature has shown that decreased coordination variability is indicative of an injured system regardless {{of the absence of}} pain. PURPOSE: To quantify <b>inter-segment</b> coordination variability during three portions of the stance phase of gait in athletes at three progressive time points post-surgery compared to the contralateral limb (NI) and healthy controls. METHODS: Three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data were collected for 10 ACLR and 10 healthy athletes matched for age, gender, and activity level. The ACLR group was measured at 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and when cleared to run post-surgery. Kinematic data were used in a modified vector coding technique to determine <b>inter-segment</b> coordination variability of lower extremity couples of interest. Statistical significance was determined using two factor multivariate ANOVAs (limb x visit) for early (1 - 33 %), mid (34 - 66 %), and late (67 - 100 %) stance with alpha level set at. 05. Tukey post-hoc tests were performed where appropriate. RESULTS: ACLR athletes have decreased <b>inter-segment</b> coordination variability of the involved lower extremity during the late stance phase of gait compared to both the contralateral limb and healthy controls at 4 weeks post-surgery. By 12 weeks post-surgery there were improvements in joint function as exemplified by <b>inter-segment</b> coordination variability of the ACLR involved limb becoming similar to the healthy control limb.

Most of these genes were expressed in several stages. However, some genes are stage- and tissue-specific such as AgCht 8 mainly in pupal and adult stages, AgCht 2 and AgCht 12 specifically in foregut, AgCht 13 exclusively in midgut. Functional analysis of each chitin synthase gene was conducted by using the chitosan/dsRNA nanoparticle-based RNA interference (RNAi) through larval feeding. The repression of the AgCHS 1 transcripts which are predominantly expressed in carcass initiated from the mosquito larval feeding of dsRNA suggests the systemic nature of RNAi in mosquito larvae. In addition, silencing of AgCHS 1 increased larval susceptibilities to diflubenzuron, whereas silencing of AgCHS 2 enhanced the peritrophic matrix disruption and thus increased larval susceptibilities to calcofluor white or dithiothreitol. Furthermore, a non-radioactive method was adapted and optimized to examine the chitin synthase activity in mosquitoes.

Markers were placed according to the OFM requirements. Motion capture was conducted using the VICON NEXUS system on two separate test days, with two tests on each day conducted by two independent examiners. The range of motion (ROM) of the following <b>inter-segments</b> was selected for further analysis: forefoot-hindfoot, forefoot-tibia and hindfoot-tibia in frontal, sagittal and transverse planes. Each step was divided in two parts, a loading phase (from heel strike to midstance) and a push-off phase (from midstance to toe-off). The Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of the measurements with 90 % confidence bounds (SEM 90) and the Minimal Differences needed to be considered real (MD) with 95 % confidence interval were calculated for inter-observer and intra-observer and effect of trial using SPSS. RESULTS: There was a linear correlation between the number of trials and the ICC's (r 2 = 0. 49, p< 0. 001), with six trial leading to good ICC's. Inter-observer repeatability: In the loading phase almost all ICC's were good or excellent (0. 53 - 0. 97) with only one parameter below 0. 60. In the push-off phase two parameters scored moderate agreement, where the other 7 parameters had well to excellent agreement. The SEM 90 values were varying from 0. 85 degrees to 2. 49 degrees in the loading phase and from 0. 92 degrees to 4. 40 degrees in the push-off phase. Intra-observer repeatability: In the loading phase all ICC's were good or excellent (0. 71 - 0. 97). In the push-off phase two parameters scored moderate agreement and the other 7 parameters had well to excellent agreement. The SEM 90 ranged from 1. 15 degrees to 4. 53 degrees in the loading phase and in the push-off phase from 1. 71 degrees to 5. 49 degrees. The SEM 90 values were varying from 0. 85 degrees to 2. 49 degrees in the loading phase and from 0. 92 degrees to 4. 40 degrees in the push-off phase.

This is problematic because the segments of the body differ with respect to several variables that can affect thermoregulation. Here, we report a study that investigated the impact on heat balance during locomotion of <b>inter-segment</b> differences in three of these variables: surface area, skin temperature and rate of movement. The approach adopted {{in the study was}} to generate heat balance estimates with the conventional method and then compare them with heat balance estimates generated with a method that takes into account <b>inter-segment</b> differences in surface area, skin temperature and rate of movement. We reasoned that, if the hypothesis that <b>inter-segment</b> differences in surface area, skin temperature and rate of movement affect heat balance during locomotion is correct, the estimates yielded by the two methods should be statistically significantly different. Anthropometric data were collected on seven adult male volunteers. The volunteers then walked on a treadmill at 1. 2 m/s while 3 D motion capture cameras recorded their movements.

40|$|Abstract. As an {{alternative}} to message passing, Rochester’s InterWeave system allows the programmer to map shared segments into programs spread across heterogeneous, distributed machines. InterWeave represents a merger and extension of our previous Cashmere and InterAct projects, combining hardware coherence within small multiprocessors, Cashmere-style lazy release consistency within tightly coupled clusters, and InterAct-style version-based consistency for distributed shared segments. In InterWeave, each shared segment evolves {{through a series of}} consistent versions. When beginning a read-only critical section on a given segment, Inter-Weave uses a programmer-specified predicate to determine whether the currently cached version, if any, is “recent enough ” to use. <b>Inter-segment</b> consistency is maintained by means of hashed vector timestamps. Automatic data conversions allow each program to employ its own natural data format, byte order, and alignment, with full support for intra- and <b>inter-segment</b> pointers. Timestamping is used to determine and communicate only those pieces of a segment that are different from the cached copy. A preliminary implementation of InterWeave is currently running on our AlphaServer cluster.

This study aims to assess the <b>inter-segment</b> coordination of the shank-thigh and thigh-sacrum pairs using the continuous relative phase (CRP). In total 87 jumps were recorded from 33 athletes with an inertial sensor-based system. The CRP curves indicated that the thighs lead the shanks during the first part of take-off extension and that the shanks rotated faster at the take-off extension end. The thighs and sacrum first rotated synchronously, with the sacrum then taking lead, with finally the thighs rotating faster. Five characteristic features were extracted from the CRP and their relationship with jump length was tested. Three features of the shank-thigh pair and one of the thigh-sacrum pair reported a significant association with jump length. It was observed that athletes who achieved longer jumps had their thighs leading their shanks during a longer time, with these athletes also having a more symmetric movement between thighs and sacrum.

This complex interaction between genomic organization and gene, as well as protein expression is not yet fully understood. Tumor characterization by gene expression analyses is not sufficient, since expression levels are only available as a snapshot of the cell status. So far, research has mainly focused on gene expression profiling or alterations in oncogenes, even though DNA microarray platforms would allow for high-throughput analyses of copy number alterations (CNAs). Methods We analyzed DNA from mouse mammary gland epithelial cells using the Affymetrix Mouse Diversity Genotyping array (MOUSEDIVm 520650) and calculated the CNAs. Segmental copy number alterations were computed based on the probeset CNAs using the circular binary segmentation algorithm. Motif search was performed in breakpoint regions (<b>inter-segment</b> regions) with the MEME suite to identify common motif sequences. Results Here we present a four stage mouse model addressing copy number alterations in tumorigenesis. No considerable changes in CNA were identified for non-transgenic mice, but a stepwise increase in CNA was found during tumor development. The segmental copy number alteration revealed informative chromosomal fragmentation patterns. In <b>inter-segment</b> regions (hypothetical breakpoint sides) unique motifs were found. Conclusions Our analyses suggest genome reorganization as a stepwise process that involves amplifications and deletions of chromosomal regions.

We show that while increased telescope diameter is always an advantage for high dynamic range science (assuming wavefront errors have been corrected sufficiently well), segmentation itself sets a limit {{on the performance of}} Lyot coronagraphs. Diffraction from <b>inter-segment</b> gaps sets a floor to the achievable extinction of on-axis starlight with Lyot coronagraphy. We derive an analytical expression for the manner in which coronagraphic suppression of an on-axis source decreases with increasing gap size when the segments are placed in a spatially periodic array over the telescope aperture, regardless of the details of the arrangement. A simple Lyot stop masking out pupil edges produces good extinction of the central peak in the point-spread function (PSF), but leaves satellite images caused by <b>inter-segment</b> gaps essentially unaffected. Masking out the bright segment gaps in the Lyot plane with a reticulated mask reduces the satellite images'intensity to a contrast of 5 x 10 ^{- 9 } on a 30 m telescope with 10 mm gaps, at the expense of an increase in the brightness of the central peak. The morphology of interesting targets will dictate which Lyot stop geometry is preferable: the reticulated Lyot stop produces a conveniently uni-modal PSF, whereas a simple Lyot stop produces an extended array of satellite spots. A cryogenic reticulate Lyot stop will also benefit both direct and coronagraphic mid-IR imaging. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

SEMs ranged from 1 % to 9 % of stance and 4 % to 27 % of maximum voluntary contraction; {{in most cases the}} 95 % confidence interval crossed zero. Excellent within-day reliability was found for the <b>inter-segment</b> kinematics in both conditions. Between-day reliability ranged from fair-to-good to excellent for kinematic variables and all ICCs were excellent; the SEM ranged from 0. 60 ° to 1. 99 °. ConclusionMulti-segmented foot kinematics can be reliably measured in RA patients with pes planovalgus. Serial measurement of discrete variables for TP and other selected leg muscles via EMG is not supported from the findings in this cohort of RA patients. Caution should be exercised when EMG measurements are considered to study disease progression or intervention effects...|$|E

In this study, we investigated the resting state network using a clinically relevant 3 T whole body MRI scanner from 14 healthy subjects. The correlation coefficient computed from rsfMRI images between each ventral or dorsal horn of different segments was used to generate the correlation matrix. Segments C 2 and C 6 demonstrated stronger correlations with other segments. Segment C 2 has a stronger <b>inter-segment</b> correlation than other segments. Functional connectivity distribution among segments was detected, which demonstrated the neural network in the human cervical spinal cord. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|NoThe {{emphasis}} {{of this paper}} is on investigating the performance of signalling protocols designed for a mobility management scheme, which uses Mobile IP for <b>inter-segment</b> mobility in a hybrid space and terrestrial environment. Initially, the system architecture, which consists of three wireless access networks attached to an IP backbone, is presented. This is followed by a description of the proposed mobility procedures employed in the system, which aim at minimising modifications to existing satellite and terrestrial network protocols. The mobility procedures are simulated in order to evaluate their performance and determine their effectiveness in an operational environment. Results verify the efficiency of the protocols and show that the additional signalling time introduced by the procedures is minimal...|$|E
