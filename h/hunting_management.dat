40|$|Hunting foxes with hounds {{has been}} a {{countryside}} pursuit in Britain since the 17 th Century, but its effect nationally on habitat management is little understood by the general public. A survey questionnaire was distributed to 163 mounted fox hunts of England and Wales to quantify their management practices in woodland and other habitat. Ninety-two hunts (56 %), covering 75, 514 km(2), returned details on woodland management motivated by the improvement of their sport. The management details were verified via on-site visits for a sample of 200 woodlands. Following verification, the area of woodlands containing the management was conservatively estimated at 24, 053 (+/- 2241) ha, comprising 5. 9 % of woodland area within {{the whole of the}} area hunted by the 92 <b>hunts.</b> <b>Management</b> techniques included: tree planting, coppicing, felling, ride and perimeter management. A case study in five hunt countries in southern England examined, through the use of botanical survey and butterfly counts, the consequences of the <b>hunt</b> <b>management</b> on woodland ground flora and butterflies. Managed areas had, within the last 5 years, been coppiced and rides had been cleared. Vegetation cover in managed and unmanaged sites averaged 86 % and 64 %, respectively, and managed areas held on average 4 more plant species and a higher plant diversity than unmanaged areas (Shannon index of diversity: 2. 25 vs. 1. 95).

50|$|Turkeys are large, long-legged {{birds that}} can {{grow up to}} four feet in height and weigh up to 30 lbs in the wild. They have a long, broad, rounded tail with 14-19 blunt feathers. They have a naked, {{wrinkled}} head and feathered body. The North American wild turkey - Meleagris gallopavo - has five distinct subspecies (Eastern, Rio Grande, Florida Osceola, Merriam's, and Gould's). Hybrids also exist where the ranges of these subspecies overlap. All are native only to North America, though transplanted populations exist elsewhere. Their plumage differs slightly by subspecies, but is generally dark to black for males, with buff to cream highlights, and generally drab brown for females. The feathers are quite iridescent and can take on distinct reddish/copper hues in sunlight. Their feathers are well defined with broad, square ends, giving the bird the appearance of being covered in scales. Males have a “beard” of coarse black bristles hanging {{from the center of}} their upper breasts and tend to have more vibrantly colored plumage than do females. They breed in the spring and their typical clutch size is between 10 and 12 eggs. The ocellated turkey (Meleagris ocellata), a different species of turkey, currently exists only in a portion of the Yucatán peninsula. After the 19th and early 20th centuries, wild turkey populations dropped significantly because of hunting and habitat loss. However, populations now flourish again due to <b>hunting</b> <b>management</b> and transplanting. The ocellated turkey, not commonly hunted, is currently threatened due to ongoing habitat loss in the Yucutan.|$|E

40|$|Scientific {{management}} of wildlife requires confronting {{the complexities of}} natural and social systems. Uncertainty poses a central problem. Whereas the importance of considering uncertainty has been widely discussed, studies {{of the effects of}} unaddressed uncertainty on real management systems have been rare. We examined the effects of outcome uncertainty and components of biological uncertainty on <b>hunt</b> <b>management</b> performance, illustrated with grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) in British Columbia, Canada. We found that both forms of uncertainty can have serious impacts on management performance. Outcome uncertainty alone – discrepancy between expected and realized mortality levels – led to excess mortality in 19 % of cases (population-years) examined. Accounting for uncertainty around estimated biological parameters (i. e., biological uncertainty) revealed that excess mortality might have occurred in up to 70 % of cases. We offer a general method for identifying targets for exploited species that incorporates uncertainty and maintains the probability of exceeding mortality limits below specified thresholds. Setting targets in our focal system using this method at thresholds of 25 % and 5 % probability of overmortality would require average target mortality reductions of 47 % and 81 %, respectively. Application of our transparent and generalizable framework to this or other systems could improve managemen...|$|R
