40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: The {{design of}} {{suitable}} air collectors {{is one of}} the most important factors controlling the economics of the solar <b>drying.</b> Air <b>type</b> <b>collectors</b> have two inherent disadvantages: Low thermal capacity of air and low absorber to air heat transfer coefficient. Different modifications are suggested and applied to improve the heat transfer coefficient between the absorber plate and air. These modifications include the use of extended heat transfer area, such as finned absorber. Approach: The efficiency of the solar collector has been examined by changing the solar radiation and the mass flow rate. An analytical and experimental study to investigate the effect of mass flow rate and solar radiation on thermal efficiency were conducted. The theoretical solution procedure of the energy equations uses a matrix inversion method and making some algebraic rearrangements. Results: The average error on calculating thermal efficiency was about 7 %. The optimum efficiency, about 70 % lies between the mass flow rates 0. 07 - 0. 08 kg sec− 1. The thermal efficiencies increase with flow rate and it increase about 30 % at mass flow rate of 0. 04 - 0. 08 kg sec− 1. Conclusion: The efficiency is increased proportional to mass flow rate and solar radiation and. the efficiency of the collector is strongly dependent on the flow rate.

The test design selected for this experiment was a complete random design which was performed with 3 repetitions. Data analysis showed that the <b>dried</b> crop <b>type</b> factor, <b>collector’s</b> <b>type</b> and duration of sampling in crop’s water loss were significant at 1 % statistical level. Data showed that average water loss of spearmint crop was 6 % more than dill at each hour. This is because different physical and textural properties of plants. Also comparison of amount of water evaporation in different durations for both iron and aluminum collectors showed that average amount of water evaporation in dryer with iron collector is 10 % more than the one with aluminum collector. Also statistics indicated that crops dehydrated with solar dryers are more favorable and benefit higher qualities from the viewpoint of marketplace. As the tendency to buy dehydrated dill and spearmint crops with solar dryers is 2 and 2. 4 times, respectively, higher than the crops dehydrated by traditional dryers.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} experimental {{collection of}} Pinctada mazatlanica spat on substrates of different textures and colors placed at different depths within settlement tanks. When larvae reached the pediveliger stage (day 25), black-colored spat <b>collectors</b> ("envelope" <b>type)</b> {{composed of the}} following materials were offered as settlement substrates: onion bag, mosquito net, fishing net, and 63 % shade-cloth. Spat collectors measured 30 x 30 cm and were composed of an outer bag and inner substrate made of the same material. The influence {{of the color of}} spat collector material on recruitment was investigated using a second <b>type</b> of spat <b>collector</b> composed of onion bags as the outer bag and inner substrate ("bag" type). Bags were prepared in 3 different outer/inner (O/I) color combinations of green/green, green/black, and red/black (O/I). Both <b>types</b> of <b>collectors</b> were deployed at different depths within settlement tanks. Approximately 2. 7 % of the initial larval population survived, resulting in 35, 583 spat. Of these, 71. 3 % recruited to bag <b>type</b> <b>collectors,</b> 21. 9 % to envelope <b>type</b> <b>collectors,</b> and 6. 8 % to the surfaces of the culture tanks. Spat recruitment was significantly affected by collector material (P < 0. 01), with fishing net and shade-cloth yielding highest and lowest density of spat, respectively. Similarly, spat collector color combination significantly influenced spat collection (P < 0. 01), with higher recruitment to red and green substrates. For both spat <b>collector</b> <b>types,</b> there was significantly greater (P < 0. 01) recruitment of spat to collectors {{in the middle of the}} water column (60 - 90 -cm depth). This study showed that both the type and color of material used for spat collectors, as well as depth of deployment, influenced recruitment of P. mazatlanica spat.

40|$|AbstractWith the {{objective}} of reducing costs and proliferating use, a special Direct Solar Irradiation Collector (DSIC) solar water heater was developed. To produce a commercially feasible product, a full research and development program was conducted that included several generations of prototypes {{and a range of}} design criteria such as material selection, manufacturing processes, economics, and materials availability. The result was a Parallel Plate <b>type</b> <b>collector</b> made out of polymers which is designed for temperate weather and low pressure household-use. It is able to achieve similar efficiencies and performance than commercial water heaters while cutting its cost by half. The present study introduces the concept and includes numerical and experimental results made on a scaled prototype. The numerical analysis compares the pressure-drop across 3 collectors. The pressure-drop is better by almost a factor of 4 when comparing the DSIC and a Parallel Tubes <b>type</b> <b>collector.</b> Performance tests were conducted outdoors to measure the temperature and solar irradiation as a function of time. Different ratios between collection area and water volume were tested. Temperature was measured simultaneously at different locations to observe the thermal gradient along the collector and water tank. Maximum temperature of 95 °C and max efficiencies on the range of 84 - 92 % were achieved by the DSIC collector...|$|R

The objectives of the study were to evaluate the system behavior, the effect of wing length, and to compare the performance of the systems with wing type and linear CPCs. A detailed dynamic simulation model was developed based on mass and energy balance equations. The simulation results show that the system performance with wing type CPC increases by up to 6 % in the summer and up to 2 % in the winter, compared to the performance with a linear CPC having same collector length. The ice production also increases up to 13 % in the summer with the wing type CPC. This shows that the wing type CPC is helpful to increase the performance of the system compared to the linear CPC with the same collector length and without the need for tracking...|$|R
