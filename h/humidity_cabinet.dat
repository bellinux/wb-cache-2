40|$|The ambient and {{cryogenic}} temperature {{mechanical properties}} and the ambient temperature stress corrosion properties of hot rolled and centerless ground Nitronic 32 stainless steel bar material are presented. The mechanical properties of longitudinal specimens were evaluated at test temperatures from ambient to liquid hydrogen. The tensile test data indicated increasing smooth tensile strength with decreasing temperature to liquid hydrogen temperature. However, below - 200 F (- 129. 0 C) the notched tensile strength decreased slightly and below - 320 F (- 196. 0 C) the decrease was significant. The elongation and {{reduction of area}} decreased drastically at temperatures below - 200 F (- 129. 0 C). The Charpy V-notched impact energy decreased steadily with decreasing test temperature. Stress corrosion tests were performed on longitudinal tensile specimens stressed to 0, 75, and 90 percent of the 0. 2 percent yield strength and on transverse 'C'-ring specimens stressed to 75 and 90 percent of the yield strength and exposed to: alternate immersion in a 3. 5 percent NaCl bath, <b>humidity</b> <b>cabinet</b> environment, and a 5 percent salt spray atmosphere. The longitudinal tensile specimens experienced no corrosive attack; however, the 'C'-rings exposed to the alternate immersion and to the salt spray experienced some shallow etching and pitting, respectively. Small cracks appeared {{in two of the}} 'C'-rings after one month exposure to the salt spray...|$|E
40|$|Low density {{polyethylene}} (LDPE) coatings {{are being}} used in an ever growing range of applications. However, non-polar characteristics of LDPE make its adhesion poor to metal substrate and so become less suitable for anticorrosive coating application. An anticorrosive coating can therefore be developed if LDPE is modified with requisite polar groups. In the present work, a polar group has been introduced in polyethylene matrix by grafting maleic acid. Grafted LDPE was characterized by chemical method, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), melt flow index (MFI), particle size analysis and hot stage optical microscopy. The presence of carbonyl peak of high intensity, high acid value and low melt flow index value confirmed grafting of maleic acid on LDPE. Change in crystallization behaviour of LDPE has been noticed after grafting. Grafted LDPE was applied on grit blasted mild steel surface by flame spray technique and adhesion study showed improved adhesion of grafted LDPE than LDPE. The coated panels were evaluated for resistance to corrosion in salt spray, <b>humidity</b> <b>cabinet</b> and seawater. The corrosion resistance of modified LDPE was also studied by AC Impedance technique. Grafted LDPE showed satisfactory corrosion resistance. Grafted LDPE was pigmented with red iron oxide and pigmented composition has shown improved resistance to corrosion in laboratory tests. © Elsevie...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{eliminate}} {{variation in}} electrometer calibration results caused by high humidity and suboptimal connectors {{on the standard}} capacitors and to implement hardware that prevents overloading of the input stage of electrometers during calibration. Methods: A humidity-controlled cabinet was installed to provide a low-humidity environment for the standard capacitors. All of the coaxial BNC connections were replaced with Triax (TRB) connectors {{with the exception of}} the output from the voltage source. A three-stage RC filter with cascaded RC low-pass sections was designed and tested. Results: The installation of the <b>humidity</b> <b>cabinet</b> resulted in a major improvement in the stability and reproducibility of the electrometer calibration system. For the three years since this upgrade, the Ionizing Radiation Standards (IRS) electrometer calibration results have been consistent regardless of the ambient relative humidity in the lab. The connector replacements improved grounding in the calibration circuit. The three-stage filter allows the voltage at the output to rise in an S-shaped waveform, resulting in a smooth rise of the current through the isolation resistor from zero and back again, with no abrupt transition. For the filter design chosen, 99. 99 of the charge is delivered within 6 s. Conclusions: A three-way improvement to the calibration measurement system was successful in eliminating the observed variations, resulting in an electrometer calibration measurement system that is unaffected by humidity and allowing reliable year-round calibrations of any electrometer encountered since the implementation of these changes.

40|$|The {{presence}} of soluble salts at the metal/paint interface {{is one of}} the main reasons that cause the premature deterioration of the painted metallic structures. This is specially important in the case of zinc substrates due to the increasing amount of galvanised structures that are painted after weathering (duplex system: galvanising+paint). Nevertheless, most of the studies to quantify the tolerable levels of soluble salts for different organic coatings have been carried out with steel substrates. In this paper, the behaviour of some organic coatings applied over pure zinc contaminated with different levels of chlorides and sulphates is analysed.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} the salt spray {{corrosion}} of polymer coating on steel substrate. In the process, firstly, steel coupons are sand blasted, chemically cleaned, and phosphated in different time periods, then the surface of steel is coated with an epoxy-polyester layer at different thicknesses which range from 50 to 180 µm and then they are cured at 200 °C for 20 min. in a liquid petroleum gas atmosphere.

40|$|Abstract: The novel tray-bioreactor was {{designed}} and constructed to produce lipases with high activities. Fermentation was conducted in this bioreactor {{in order to produce}} lipase from agricultural products/residues by Aspergillus niger. Regarding this issue, several agricultural products and residues including rice bran, sugarcane baggase, wheat bran, barley bran and corn meal were employed. Among them rice bran led to maximum lipase production under similar condition.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Primarily to {{establish}} whether artificial saliva (AS) at 37 degrees C is essential as a clinically relevant environment for testing filled, resin composite restorative materials. The effect of other storage conditions was also investigated for comparison and controls: desiccation, {{exposure to the}} laboratory atmosphere, high <b>humidity</b> <b>cabinet,</b> saturated water vapor, and deionized water. METHODS: Two visible light-cured products were used: Heliomolar Radiopaque (HR) and Tetric Ceram (TC) (Ivoclar, Schaan, Liechtenstein). Bar specimens (26 x 1. 5 x 1. 0 mm(3)) were cured at five overlapping spots for 60 s per spot and randomly distributed into groups of six. Trial 1 : one group of each material was exposed first to atmospheric air at 24 degrees C, approximately 50 % RH (24 WV(50)), then to water vapor at 37 degrees C, approximately 97 % RH (37 WV(97)), and then immersed in deionized water at 37 degrees C (37 DW). Trial 2 used three groups of each material, one first exposed to 37 WV(97) followed by 37 DW, {{the other two were}} immediately immersed in 37 DW or artificial saliva (37 AS). Trial 3 : two groups of each material were vacuum desiccated at 37 degrees C, then exposed to 37 degrees C, approximately 100 % RH (37 WV(100)), then immersed in 37 DW or 37 AS. Trial 4 : four groups of HR were treated similarly to Trial 3; one was left under desiccation, and another in 37 WV(100) for the remaining period. Three-point bend tests for flexural strength (F), flexural modulus (E), and total energy to failure (W) were performed at the end of Trials 2 - 4. RESULTS: Environmental moisture absorption was substantial at 24 WV(50) (c. 0. 2 %), at least 40 % of that in 37 DW (HR: c. 0. 7 %, TC: c. 0. 5 %). Saturation was achievable in 37 WV(100). Mass loss on desiccation (HR: c. 0. 4 - 0. 5 %, TC: c. 0. 25 %) was reversible in 37 WV(100). There were some significant effects of exposure conditions on mechanical properties (e. g. F for HR: after desiccation, 85. 7 +/- 1. 4 MPa; after 37 WV(100), 73. 2 +/- 3. 6 MPa; difference: p< 0. 0002), but overall the results were unclear. After a rapid gain in mass, there was a gradual loss in both 37 DW and 37 AS for both materials, slightly more in 37 AS than 37 DW. SIGNIFICANCE: Water vapor absorption is substantial, hence attention must be paid to the laboratory working environment and conditions of storage and testing, i. e. temperature and RH must be stated to assist interpretation of data and comparisons between studies. Test conditions need to be standardized and with reference to normal oral conditions, immediate immersion in artificial saliva at 37 degrees C is the preferred treatment for these materials, whatever time of testing is chosen...|$|E
40|$|Composite {{materials}} are increasingly used in aerospace, naval and high performance civil engineering {{structures such as}} aerospace, submarines, automobiles. The structural components, subjected to in-plane harmonic loads may undergo parametric resonance or dynamic stability due to certain combinations of the applied in-plane forcing parameters and natural frequency of transverse vibration. The parametric instability itself requires investigation of vibration and buckling of structures. The present study deals with free vibration, buckling and parametric resonance behavior of laminated composite plates under in-plane periodic loading under varying temperatureand moisture. In this analysis, the effects of various parameters such as number of layers, aspect ratios, side-to thickness ratios, ply orientations, static load factors, lamination angle {{and the degree of}} orthotropic are studied. A simple laminated plate model based on the first order shear deformation theory (FSDT) is developed for the free vibration, buckling and parametric instability effects of composite plates subjected to hygrothermal loading. The principal instability regions are obtained using Bolotin’s approach employing finite element method (FEM). An eight-node isoparametric quadratic element is employed in the present analysis with five degree of freedom per node. The element is modified to accommodate the laminated composite plates under hygrothermal environment, considering the effects of transverse shear deformation and rotary inertia. The element stiffness matrix, geometric stiffness matrix due to residual stresses, element mass matrix, geometric stiffness matrix due to applied in-plane loads and nodal load vector of the element are derived using the principle of minimum potential energy. They are evaluated using the Gauss quadrature numerical integration technique. Reduced integration technique is applied to avoid the possible shear locking. A computer program based on FEM in MATLAB environment is developed to perform all necessary computations. The basic vibration and buckling experiments are performed on the industry driven woven fiber Glass/Epoxy specimens subjected to hygrothermal environment. The specimens were hygrothermally conditioned in a <b>humidity</b> <b>cabinet</b> where the conditions were maintained at temperatures of 300 K- 425 K and relative humidity (RH) ranging from 0 - 1. 0 % for moisture concentrations. The numerical and experimental results show that there is reduction in natural frequencies and buckling loads with increasing temperature and moisture concentration for laminates both for simply supported and clamped boundary conditions. The dynamic instability study using FEM revealed that, due to the static component of load, the instability regions tend to shift to lower frequencies. The onset of instability occurs earlier and the width of dynamic instability regions increases with rise in temperature and moisture concentration for different parameters. With increase in lamination angle, the width of the instability region becomes smaller. The onset of instability occurs later for square plates than rectangular plates with wider instability region with increase of aspect ratio. The ply orientation significantly affects the onset of instability. It is observed that the excitation frequency increases with introduction of curvatures from flat panel to doubly curved panel in hygrothermal environments. Thus the instability behaviour of laminated composite panels is influenced by increase in number of layers, aspect ratio, side to thickness ratio, increase in static and dynamic load factor, geometry, material, ply lay-up and its orientation. This can be utilized to tailor the design of laminated composite panels in hygrothermal environment...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{ultrasonic}} humidification system on unwrapped meat in a chilled retail display cabinet were assessed. Humidification raised the relative <b>humidity</b> of the <b>cabinet</b> air from a mean of 76. 7 % to just below saturation at 98. 8 %. This reduced the mean evaporative weight loss from whole samples of meat after 14 h from 1. 68 % to 0. 62 % of their initial weight. The rate of deterioration in {{the appearance of the}} meat due to dehydration was reduced to the extent that while the unhumidified trial was terminated after 14 h because all samples were judged to be unacceptable, the humidified trial was continued for 24 h without any major changes in appearance. Levels of presumptive pseudomonas bacteria were relatively high in water samples taken from the humidification system and defrost water during the humidified trial, but Legionella spp. were not isolated. Significant increases in the numbers of bacteria on the meat during either trial were only found in one case, that of humidified minced beef. However, some of the samples had high counts even before display, and this may have masked any effect due to humidification. Differences in levels of air-borne contamination were small and inconsistent. Air temperatures were raised by humidification by between 1 and 2 °C and this was reflected in similarly raised product temperatures. Temperatures of air leaving the evaporator indicated that this was due to icing of the evaporator in the periods leading up to defrosts...|$|R
