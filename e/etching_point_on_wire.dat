50|$|Frequency select mode bases its {{decision}} on the frequencies being emitted from the floor. When an AGV approaches a <b>point</b> <b>on</b> the <b>wire</b> which splits the AGV detects the two frequencies and through a table stored in its memory decides on the best path. The different frequencies are required only at the decision point for the AGV. The frequencies can change back to one set signal after this point. This method is not easily expandable and requires extra cutting meaning more money.|$|R
50|$|A {{balanced}} circuit is circuitry {{for use with}} a balanced line or the balanced line itself. Balanced lines are a common method of transmitting many types of electrical communication signals between two <b>points</b> <b>on</b> two <b>wires.</b> In a balanced line the two signal lines are of a matched impedance to help ensure that interference induced in the line is common-mode and can be removed at the receiving end by circuitry with good common-mode rejection. To maintain the balance, circuit blocks which interface to the line, or are connected in the line, must also be balanced.|$|R
25|$|For a bead sliding <b>on</b> a {{frictionless}} <b>wire</b> subject only {{to gravity}} in 2d space, the constraint on the bead can be {{stated in the}} form f(r) = 0, where {{the position of the}} bead can be written r = (x(s), y(s)), in which s is a parameter, the arc length s along the curve from some <b>point</b> <b>on</b> the <b>wire.</b> This is a suitable choice of generalized coordinate for the system. Only one coordinate is needed instead of two, because the position of the bead can be parameterized by one number, s, and the constraint equation connects the two coordinates x and y; either one is determined from the other. The constraint force is the reaction force the <b>wire</b> exerts <b>on</b> the bead to keep it <b>on</b> the <b>wire,</b> and the non-constraint applied force is gravity acting on the bead.|$|R
2500|$|The term plug is {{in general}} and {{technical}} use in all forms of English, common alternatives being power plug, [...] electric plug, and (in the UK) plug top. The normal technical term (in both British and International English) for an AC power socket is socket-outlet, but in non-technical contexts {{a number of other}} terms are in common use. In British English the general term is socket, but there are numerous common alternatives, including power point, plug socket, wall socket, and wall plug. In American English receptacle (which is a term not defined in IEC 60050) is used in official standards and codes such as the NEMA connector standard and the National Electrical Code. [...] The American National Electrical Contractors Association's National Electrical Installation Standards (NECA 130-2010) defines outlet as [...] "A <b>point</b> <b>on</b> the <b>wiring</b> system at which current is taken to supply utilization equipment." [...] In common use outlet is used to refer to the actual receptacle or socket, sometimes with qualifiers such as wall outlet, electrical outlet and electrical receptacle, all of these sometimes {{to be found in the}} same document. [...] There is also colloquial use of socket in American English.|$|R
40|$|MastersThis computer‐assisted study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the fit {{of a variety of}} commercially available preformed nickel titanium orthodontic arch <b>wires</b> <b>on</b> the dental arches of Saudi male and female subjects presenting with normal occlusion. The objectives were to measure the differences between the tested wires and the dental arches in terms of mean absolute error and to use these measurements to compare between the wires and find the ones that fit the sample best. The materials studied included 40 sets of upper and lower plaster models (20 males and 20 females) Saudi subjects presen ng with Class I normal occlusion and eighteen pairs of upper and lower preformed nickel titanium orthodontic arch wires. The models and wires were digitally imaged and introduced to the computer. Using the MATLAB® environment, multiple programs were written specifically for the purpose image digitization, numerical manipula on and data analysis. The differences between 14 points represen ng the teeth and corresponding <b>points</b> <b>on</b> the <b>wires</b> were measured and the mean absolute error was calculated. When the results of mean absolute error derived from each tested wire were compared and analyzed it was concluded that 3 M Orthoform LA was the best fi ng wire for the mixed (combined female and male cases) as well as the female sample groups, and that Ormco’s Orthos arch large was the best fitting wire for the male sample group...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} {{currents and}} the power losses were observed for superconducting wires that were carrying 60 cps. currents. The wires were made of niobium, niobium alloyed with 10 %, 25 % and 33 % zirconium, and PbBi 18 %. The wire diameters ranged from 10 mils to 62. 5 mils. Near 4. 2 °K all the wires containing niobium remained superconducting until the peak value of the 60 cps. magnetic field at some <b>point</b> <b>on</b> the <b>wire</b> surface had reached or exceeded the bulk critical field of niobium. For the lead alloy the peak value was higher than expected for pure lead. The d. c. transition currents were also measured and were usually greater than the peak a. c. values. In addition, the experiment showed that alternating current power losses occurred while the peak field was far below the transition field. For any given wire, the losses were observed to increase as In. The magnitude of these power losses also varied with the material and {{the diameter of the}} wire. The results agreed reasonably well with data from other experiments. To study the results a model was used which had a superconducting cylinder surrounded by a shell of normal material. Maxwell's and London's equations were solved for this situation. The solutions did not predict the obsered relation between the current {{and the power}} loss, but they suggested that some form of flux trapping or hysteresis behavior-should have been included in the model...|$|R
40|$|The ideal mapping {{technology}} for transmission line inspection is the airborne LiDAR executed from helicopter platforms. It allows for full 3 D geometry extraction in highly automated manner. Large scale aerial {{images can be}} also used for this purpose, however, automation is possible only for finding transmission line positions (2 D geometry), and the sag needs to be estimated manually. For longer lines, these techniques are less expensive than ground surveys, yet they are still expensive. UAS technology {{has the potential to}} reduce these costs, especially if using inexpensive platforms with consumer grade cameras. This study investigates the potential of using high resolution UAS imagery for automatic modeling of transmission line 3 D geometry. The key point of this experiment was to employ dense matching algorithms to appropriately acquired UAS images to have <b>points</b> created also <b>on</b> <b>wires.</b> This allowed to model the 3 D geometry of transmission lines similarly to LiDAR acquired point clouds. Results showed that the transmission line modeling is possible with a high internal accuracy for both, horizontal and vertical directions, even when wires were represented by a partial (sparse) point cloud...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} set-up {{of the hot}} wire method is presented. The present design allows the measurement of the temperatures at two different <b>points</b> <b>on</b> the heating <b>wire</b> with an acquisition system that performs measurements at a frequency of 1 kHz with a 12 bit numerical converter. An analytical solution for the direct model for the time dependent problem of heat transfer is employed. It {{is based on the}} quadrupole method which basically consists in a transfer matrix approach which is possible through the use of Laplace transforms. It extends the electrical analogy of heat transfer problems using the notion of impedance, and allows {{to take into account the}} thermal behavior of the wire, as well as contact resistance and heat loss effects in a very simple straightforward way. In the identification process carried on the temperature experimental data relies on a sampling of the data that is logarithmically spaced in time. The initial guesses for the thermal conductivity values are obtained applying the well known and ideal model of the linear temperature evolution versus the logarithm of the time. These values are used t...|$|R

Performance and Carcass Quality of Broilers Raised <b>on</b> <b>Wire</b> Flooring With and Without Padded Roosts Two {{experiments}} were performed with broilers raised <b>on</b> <b>wire</b> flooring {{with and without}} padded roosts to {{study the effects of}} bird performance and carcass quality. Each experiment had 480 straight-run commercial broilers divided equally into two treatments and reared <b>on</b> <b>wire</b> with and without padded roosts. At 49 days of age, body weights were taken and feed conversions were calculated. Birds were observed for percent mortality, percent deformed legs, percent breast blisters, percent feather follicle infection (folliculitis) and foot pad dermatitis. In Experiment 1, percent incidence breast blisters was the only parameter with a significant difference (P<. 05) between birds <b>on</b> plain <b>wire</b> and birds reared <b>on</b> <b>wire</b> with padded roosts. In Experiment 2, no significant differences were observed in the parameters measured between the birds reared <b>on</b> <b>wire</b> with and without padded roosts. II. Performance and Carcass Quality with Broilers Reared <b>On</b> <b>Wire</b> Flooring, Plastic Inserts, Wood Slats and Plastic Coated Expanded Metal Flooring 2 Each With and Without Padded Roosts Commercial straight-run broilers were reared on non-litter flooring in two experiments. Experiment 1 had (control <b>on</b> wire; <b>wire</b> with padded roosts; wood slats; wood slats with padded roosts; plastic insert over wire; plastic insert over wire with padded roosts; plastic coated expanded metal; plastic coated expanded metal with padded roosts) to study the effects on broiler performance and carcass quality. In Experiment 1, mean body weights, foot pad dermatitis, feed conversion and percent incidences of mortality, deformed legs and body fat were not significantly different among the treatments. Feather soilage score and percent incidence of feather follicle infection were significantly higher (P<. 05) for broilers reared on wood slats with and without padded roosts compared to those reared <b>on</b> <b>wire</b> and plastic inserts. Percent incidence breast blister was significantly higher (P<. 05) for controls <b>on</b> <b>wire</b> than all other treatments. In Experiment 2, mean body weights, feed conversion and percent incidences of feather follicle infection, deformed legs and mortality were not significantly different among treatments. Feather soilage score was significantly lower (P<. 05) with birds reared <b>on</b> <b>wire</b> both with and without padded roosts than those on expanded metal. Foot pad dermatitis scores and percent incidence breast blisters were significantly higher (P<. 05) among controls <b>on</b> <b>wire</b> than birds <b>on</b> <b>wire</b> with padded roosts and birds on expanded metal.
