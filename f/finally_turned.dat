5|$|Through Gotti {{associate}} Angelo Ruggiero, Massino {{was able}} to meet with defense attorney John Pollok in 1984 to negotiate his surrender. He <b>finally</b> <b>turned</b> himself in on July 7 and was released on $350,000 bail. That year, Massino and Salvatore Vitale secured no-show jobs with the Long Island based King Caterers in exchange for protecting them from Lucchese extortion.|$|E
5|$|The transit observed, Endeavour {{departed}} Tahiti on 13 July {{and headed}} northwest to allow Cook to survey and name the Society Islands. Landfall {{was made at}} Huahine, Raiatea and Borabora, providing opportunities for Cook to claim each of them as British territories. However, an attempt to land the pinnace on the Austral Island of Rurutu was thwarted by rough surf and the rocky shoreline. On 15 August, Endeavour <b>finally</b> <b>turned</b> south to explore the open ocean for Terra Australis Incognita.|$|E
5|$|Renovation of Kenilworth Road was {{neglected}} for {{the next}} two decades—financial difficulties and the club's ambitions to build a new ground meant that regeneration was unaffordable, and would also prove unnecessary should relocation occur. However, following the rejection of several potential sites for a new ground, the club <b>finally</b> <b>turned</b> their attentions back to the maintenance of Kenilworth Road. The first real modernisation of the ground came in 1973, with the first addition of seats at the stadium since the construction of the new Main Stand in 1922. The Bobbers Stand became all-seated, {{while the rest of the}} ground remained terracing. The new-look stand could only hold 1,539 seats, and as a result the capacity of the ground dropped to 22,601.|$|E

5|$|Though Brownlee {{was no more}} {{enthusiastic}} than Reid about deficits, his continued confidence in his Provincial Treasurer was evidenced by his decision to give him yet another ministerial portfolio. In 1930 Brownlee secured Alberta's long-sought control over its natural resources from the federal government, and he appointed Reid Alberta's first Minister of Lands and Mines on 10 October 1930. In this capacity, Reid favoured private over public ownership. He opposed calls from his own party to promote government-developed hydroelectricity projects, and viewed the provincially owned railways as a burden to the government, though they <b>finally</b> <b>turned</b> a profit in 1927. He was a leading advocate of selling them to private interests, a course that was eventually followed in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{would end}} up leaving Iberia {{in order to deal}} with the Austrians in Central Europe, but the Peninsular War {{continued}} on long after his absence. He never returned to Spain after the 1808 campaign. Several months after Corunna, the British sent another army to the peninsula under the future Duke of Wellington. The war then settled into a complex and asymmetric strategic deadlock where all sides struggled to gain the upper hand. The highlight of the conflict became the brutal guerrilla warfare that engulfed much of the Spanish countryside. Both sides committed the worst atrocities of the Napoleonic Wars during this phase of the conflict. The vicious guerrilla fighting in Spain, largely absent from the French campaigns in Central Europe, severely disrupted the French lines of supply and communication. Although France maintained roughly 300,000 troops in Iberia during the Peninsular War, the vast majority were tied down to garrison duty and to intelligence operations. The French were never able to concentrate all of their forces effectively, prolonging the war until events elsewhere in Europe <b>finally</b> <b>turned</b> the tide in favor of the Allies. After the invasion of Russia in 1812, the number of French troops in Spain vastly declined as Napoleon needed reinforcements to conserve his strategic position in Europe. By 1814, after scores of battles and sieges throughout Iberia, the Allies had managed to push the French out of the peninsula.|$|E
25|$|This {{story was}} proved {{at least partly}} correct, when it was {{announced}} by the BCB that Fountain had indeed, joined the coaching & support staff of the Bangladesh Team. Kleusener <b>finally</b> <b>turned</b> down the role of bowling coach, which was then awarded to the highly acclaimed, and significantly more qualified, Ian Pont.|$|E

25|$|It {{was already}} too late. The Japanese armies in Central Burma had lost most of their equipment, and their cohesion. They {{would be unable to}} stop the Fourteenth Army {{exploiting}} to within striking distance of Rangoon. Furthermore, with the loss of Mandalay, the Burmese population <b>finally</b> <b>turned</b> against the Japanese. Uprisings by guerilla forces and a revolt by the Burma National Army, which the Japanese had formed two years previously, would contribute to the eventual Japanese defeat.|$|E
25|$|While Modern Life Is Rubbish was a {{moderate}} success, it was Blur's third album Parklife {{that made them}} arguably the most popular band in the UK in 1994. Parklife continued the fiercely British nature of its predecessor, and coupled {{with the death of}} Nirvana's Kurt Cobain in April of that year it seemed that British alternative rock had <b>finally</b> <b>turned</b> back the tide of grunge dominance. That same year Oasis released their debut album Definitely Maybe, which broke Suede's record for fastest-selling debut album.|$|E
25|$|Having taken {{command of}} the Army of Tennessee General Hood {{immediately}} took the offensive, attacking Sherman {{in a series of}} spectacular but ill-advised assaults that ultimately sealed his fate at Atlanta. The first of these came at Peachtree Creek, where the 33rd Alabama was held in reserve and played no role in the contest. Hood's men were initially successful, but miscommunication and fierce Federal counterattacks <b>finally</b> <b>turned</b> the tide in Sherman's favor, and the Army of Tennessee was forced into the fortifications around the city.|$|E
50|$|In 1942, the DAF reorganised its {{tactics and}} {{upgraded}} its inventory. Spitfires were eventually assigned {{in the air}} superiority role, becoming operational in August 1942, which allowed the DAF to <b>finally</b> <b>turn</b> the tide.|$|R
50|$|Daniel {{joined his}} local club Hull City on schoolboy forms in 1969, {{becoming}} an apprentice in 1971, and <b>finally</b> <b>turning</b> professional in September 1973. He played five seasons at Boothferry Park in the Second Division.|$|R

25|$|Gibson's bid {{to freshen}} the {{team up with}} younger players failed to improve things as Park endured another woeful {{campaign}} in which they managed only one win in eighteen prior to the final month of the First Division season. With back-to-back relegation looking imminent, they <b>finally</b> <b>turned</b> things around in remarkable fashion as they won their remaining four games {{to pull off the}} Great Escape. Tommy Hunter and departing bowler John Costain both performed crucially in those matches with the latter taking five wickets in his final appearance.|$|E
25|$|O'Banion's {{murder by}} members of the Chicago Outfit in November 1924 sparked a major gang war in the city. Public opinion <b>finally</b> <b>turned</b> against the gangs, and the number of bombings in Chicago {{declined}} dramatically as extortionists sought more subtle means of intimidating victims. Alterie left Chicago for Colorado (and safety), leaving Shea in charge of the Theatrical Janitors' Union. Unwilling to take sides in the gang war, Shea continued to work as secretary-treasurer and business agent for the union and engaged in low-level extortion for the next five years.|$|E
25|$|Klusener severed all of {{his ties}} with the Indian Cricket League in late 2009 and then {{completed}} a Level-three coaching course provided by Cricket South Africa in Spring 2010. Klusener confirmed he was in negotiations with the Bangladesh Cricket Board about becoming the team bowling coach. However, in early September 2010 the Bangladesh Cricket Board confirmed {{that they were still}} awaiting a response from Klusener. Lance Klusener had <b>finally</b> <b>turned</b> down the offer to take over as Bangladesh's bowling coach, replacing Sri Lanka's Champaka Ramanayake. Klusener was reportedly unable to convince his wife about a permanent move to Bangladesh.|$|E

25|$|Half an hour {{into the}} final day, Warne <b>finally</b> <b>turned</b> the tide back in favour of the Australians and {{effectively}} sealed the victory. Thorpe pushed forward to a fuller delivery and missed it, then Hick was caught {{off the back of}} his bat after the ball ricocheted off his arm. Gooch added 30 with Gatting and another 30 with wicketkeeper Steve Rhodes, but both managed to nick the new ball to Healy off McDermott's bowling. Warne cleaned up the tail to finish with match figures of 11–108 and pick up the man-of-the-match award, and the game was over before tea on the final day, England mustering 323.|$|E
25|$|In a {{remarkable}} mistake, Muller left Laroche's division at Mannheim {{on the east}} bank. Laroche understood very well that his division was badly exposed. He {{would have liked to}} defend the position of Neckerau but it had no bridge, while Mannheim had a bridge. He <b>finally</b> <b>turned</b> to Ney for advice, who suggested moving the bridge to Neckerau. On 18 September, Charles with 22,000 troops assaulted Laroche who had only 5,200 soldiers. Even so, the French resisted stoutly. Ney brought some of his troops to help, but the Austrians overran Neckerau on Laroche's right and drove for the bridge. In the end, the Austrians almost managed to cross to the west bank by the bridge, but were finally stopped.|$|E
25|$|The life of Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (born Nicolae Georgescu) spanned {{most of the}} 20th century, from 1906 to 1994. In {{his native}} Romania, he lived through two world wars and three dictatorships before he fled the country. Living in {{political}} exile in the US {{in the second part}} of his life, he witnessed at a distance the rise and fall of socialism in Romania. He made many important contributions to mainstream neoclassical economics before he <b>finally</b> <b>turned</b> against it and published his paradigmatic magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process. Although this opus was seminal in establishing ecological economics as an independent academic subdiscipline in economics, Georgescu-Roegen died disappointed and bitter that his paradigmatic work did not receive the appreciation he had expected for it in his own lifetime.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s, MGM {{sold its}} rights to The Forty Days of Musa Dagh and after several {{abortive}} attempts, the novel was <b>finally</b> <b>turned</b> {{into a movie}} in 1982, directed by Sarky Mouradian with screenplay by Alex Hakobian. It was a low-budget, low-profile production that seriously abridged the original. In 2006, Sylvester Stallone expressed his desire to direct a film about Musa Dagh, according to Professor Savaş Eğilmez of Atatürk University. An e-mail campaign sponsored by the Armenian-genocide denying Foundation for the Struggle Against Baseless Allegations of Genocide (ASİMED), pressured Stallone into not proceeding with the film. In early 2009, reports surfaced that Mel Gibson was also considering directing a documentary and appearing in the adaptation of Werfel's novel but was dissuaded after receiving 3,000 e-mails from a Turkish pressure group.|$|E
25|$|The Tatra Confederation rose in popularity, having {{dozens of}} cells around Limanowa, Wadowice and Myślenice towns, and almost 500 members {{by the end}} of 1941. However, in January 1942 it was {{infiltrated}} by the Gestapo and broken up. Apostoł escaped arrest by chance, and went into hiding. She moved between Skomielna, Jordanów, and Bogdanówka near Myślenice, where she was <b>finally</b> <b>turned</b> in by an informant and arrested along with her co-conspirator Tadeusz Popek on August 22, 1942. She was brought to the Palace Hotel– the Gestapo headquarters in Zakopane– and interrogated for three months. From there, she was transferred to prison in Kraków and a month later deported to Auschwitz where she worked for the Gardening Commando (prisoner # 26,273). On January 18, 1945 she was evacuated to Ravensbrück, {{along with the rest of}} the female prisoners and taken to its Malchow sub-camp. She escaped near Leipzig from one of the subsequent transports and survived the war.|$|E
25|$|The leftmost attack column {{crossed the}} Ill {{downstream}} at the hamlet of Noffles {{early in the}} morning. It was supposed to veer {{to the right and}} get behind Jellacic's defenses, but it was repulsed. The left-center column assaulted the Blasenberg height but it too was defeated. A third column {{to the left of the}} main road attacked the Saint Michael's Wood but met the same fate as the other columns. Masséna sent 12 battalions charging up the main road while a small force tried a right hook around the flank of the entrenchments. The flanking force made headway before being stalled. Jellacic made economical use of his outnumbered force. Masséna's main assault in front failed and was sent on its way by a final counterattack by Jellacic's men. In the early going the French troops captured about 500 prisoners and seemed to be on the verge of victory, but the heavy defensive fire and rocks thrown at them <b>finally</b> <b>turned</b> them back.|$|E
