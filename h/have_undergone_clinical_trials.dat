40|$|Abdominal aortic {{aneurysm}} (AAA) {{is a common}} degenerative condition with high mortality in older men. Elective surgical or endovascular repair is performed to prevent rupture of large AAAs. In contrast, despite gradual expansion, small AAAs have a low risk of rupture, and there is currently no well-defined treatment strategy for them. Therefore, a pharmacological approach for AAA is expected in the clinical setting. Indeed, several therapeutic effects of pharmacological agents {{have been reported in}} experimental models, and some agents <b>have</b> <b>undergone</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b> Treatment with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory agents appears to inhibit the growth rate of AAA in humans. However, as the sample size and follow-up period were limited in these studies, a large randomized study with long-term follow-up of small AAA should be per-formed to clarify the effect of these agents. Recently, the regression of AAA using molecular pharma-cological approaches was reported in experimental studies. The characteristics of these strategies are the regulation of multiple molecular mediators and the signalling networks associated with AAA formation.

40|$|Alzheimer’s {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder linked to oligomerization and fibrillization of amyloid β peptides, with Aβ 1 - 42 being the most aggregative and neurotoxic one. We report herein the synthesis and conformational analysis of Aβ 1 - 42 -amyloid related β-hairpin peptidomimetics, built on a piperidine-pyrrolidine semi rigid β-turn inducer and bearing two small recognition peptide sequences, designed on oligomeric and fibril structures of Aβ 1 - 42. According to these peptide sequences, a stable β-hairpin or a dynamic equilibrium between two possible architectures was observed. These original constructs are able to greatly delay the kinetics of Aβ 1 - 42 aggregation process as demonstrated by thioflavin-T fluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy. Capillary electrophoresis indicates their ability to preserve the monomer species, inhibiting the formation of toxic oligomers. Furthermore, compounds protect against toxic effects of Aβ on neuroblastoma cells even at substoichiometric concentrations. This study is the first example of acyclic small β-hairpin mimics possessing such a highly efficient anti-aggregation activity. The protective effect is more pronounced than that observed with molecules which <b>have</b> <b>undergone</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b> The structural elements made in this study provide valuable insights {{in the understanding of}} the aggregation process and insights to explore the design of novel acyclic β-hairpin targeting other types of amyloid-forming proteins...|$|E

40|$|Heparanase is {{the unique}} and {{specific}} functional endoglycosidase capable of cleaving heparan sulfate (HS) chains. It exerts its enzymatic activity catalyzing the cleavage of the β (1, 4) -glycosidic bond between glucuronic acid and glucosamine residue. HS cleavage results in remodelling of the extracellular matrix {{as well as}} in regulating the release of many HS-linked molecules such as growth factors, cytokines and enzymes involved in inflammation, wound healing and tumour invasion. A pro-metastatic and pro-angiogenic role for this enzyme has been widely demonstrated in many primary human tumours since high levels of heparanase correlate with lymph node and distant metastasis, elevated micro vessel density and reduced survival of cancer patients. Recently, data have been reported that heparanase regulates heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan- 1 and promotes its shedding from the cell surface. Shed syndecan- 1 in turn controls tumour growth, metastasis and neo-angiogenesis mainly by promoting growth-factor signaling in the tumour milieu. Considering that, once inactivated, there are no other molecules capable of performing the same function, it is evident how this enzyme may be an effective and attractive drug target. Several heparanase inhibitors have been developed and some of them <b>have</b> <b>undergone</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> showing efficacy against tumours. In this mini-review we will discuss current knowledge of heparanase involvement in cancer as well as its targeted inhibition as a promising therapeutic option in tumour treatment...|$|E

Lamivudine has recently received approval {{for clinical use}} against chronic human HBV infection, and both PCV and PMEA <b>have</b> <b>undergone</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> against HBV in their respective prodrug forms {famciclovir and adefovir dipivoxil [bis-(POM) -PMEA]}. Since multidrug combinations {{are likely to be}} used to control HBV infection, investigation of potential interactions between PCV, 3 TC, and PMEA is important. Primary duck hepatocyte cultures which were either acutely or congenitally infected with the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) were used to investigate in vitro interactions between PCV, 3 TC, and PMEA. Here we show that the anti-DHBV effects of all the combinations containing PCV, 3 TC, and PMEA are greater than that of each of the individual components and that their combined activities are approximately additive or synergistic. These results may underestimate the potential in vivo usefulness of PMEA-containing combinations, since there is evidence that PMEA has immunomodulatory activity and, at least in the duck model of chronic HBV infection, is capable of inhibiting DHBV replication in cells other than hepatocytes, the latter being unaffected by treatment with either PCV or 3 TC. Further investigation of the antiviral activities of these drug combinations is therefore required, particularly since each of the component drugs is already in clinical use...|$|E
40|$|The {{recognition}} of invading pathogens and endogenous molecules from damaged tissues by toll-like receptors (TLRs) triggers protective self-defense mechanisms. However, excessive TLR activation disrupts the immune homeostasis by sustained pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines production and consequently {{contributes to the}} development of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), infection-associated sepsis, atherosclerosis, and asthma. Therefore, inhibitors/antagonists targeting TLR signals may be beneficial to treat these disorders. In this article, we first briefly summarize the pathophysiological role of TLRs in the inflammatory diseases. We then focus on reviewing the current knowledge in both preclinical and clinical studies of various TLR antagonists/inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory diseases. These compounds range from conventional small molecules to therapeutic biologics and nanodevices. In particular, nanodevices are emerging as a new class of potent TLR inhibitors for their unique properties in desired bio-distribution, sustained circulation, and preferred pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles. More interestingly, the inhibitory activity of these nanodevices can be regulated through precise nano-functionalization, making them the next generation therapeutics or “nano-drugs. ” Although, significant efforts have been made in developing different kinds of new TLR inhibitors/antagonists, only limited numbers of them <b>have</b> <b>undergone</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials,</b> and none have been approved for clinical uses to date. Nevertheless, these findings and continuous studies of TLR inhibition highlight the pharmacological regulation of TLR signaling, especially on multiple TLR pathways, as future promising therapeutic strategy for various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases...|$|E

Panduratin A arrested cancer cells labelled with Annexin-V and propidium iodide in the G 0 /G 1 phase and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In an animal model study, male Sprague–Dawley rats were fed with AIN diet containing ethanolic extracts prepared from the equivalent of 4 % by weight of dried rhizomes of B. pandurata and C. longa. Aberrant crypt foci (ACFs) were induced by two subcutaneous doses (15 mg/kg body weight) of azoxymethane (AOM) 1 week apart. The rats were killed 10 weeks later, and the ACFs were assessed in the colon. At the dose given to rats, it appeared that the extracts were not toxic. Total ACFs were slightly reduced by B. pandurata extract compared to control group but not significantly different.
