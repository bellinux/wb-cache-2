The ground isolation circuit {{of the present}} invention is constructed using a pair of matched mixer circuits. each of which receives a carrier signal from the same oscillator circuit. The first mixer circuit also receives the baseband signal input after appropriate conditioning, and modulates the baseband signal onto the carrier signal. In the preferred embodiment, the carrier signal has a predetermined frequency which is at least two times {{the frequency of the}} baseband signal. The modulated signal (which preferably comprises an rf signal) is transmitted via an rf transmission line to the second mixer, which demodulates the rf signal to recover the baseband signal. Each port of the mixer circuits connects to an isolation transformer to insure isolation from ground interference...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new method {{for the study}} of heavy-light mesons in the static {{approximation}} of lattice QCD which is optimally effective in <b>isolating</b> <b>ground</b> and excited states. With "MOST" (Maximal Operator Smearing Technique), the heavy quark is smeared at all possible positions relative to the light quark, subject to the constraint of cubic symmetry. With correlation functions constructed using this set as a variational basis, eigenstates of the transfer matrix are projected out at very small time separations, where statistical errors are small. We illustrate the utility of the method with preliminary results for the meson decay constant f_B^ stat, binding energies and wave functions of the lowest states. The method produces dynamically-improved interpolating fields which can be used for matrix element calculations. Comment: 3 pages, uuencode-compressed-tar Postscript file.

5000|$|One such {{source of}} ground noise is the <b>isolated</b> <b>ground</b> loop. The <b>isolated</b> <b>ground</b> loop {{differs from the}} ground loop in {{that there is no}} {{secondary}} connection to power supply ground or other non-signal ground. Instead two signal ground conductors (such as the outer conductor of stereo coaxial audio wire) are common at the amplifier input (by an internal connection in the multi-channel amplifier), they travel some distance whereupon they experience different induction currents and then are made common at some other secondary location (typically a multi-channel signal source device), as in stereo patch cords. The induction currents being different for each of the two outer coaxial conductors set up a current between the two which results in a difference in potential appearing at the negative input terminals at the amplifier, with respect to the positive input terminals. The problem is made worse by the increasing the length of the cables, and their proximity to devices radiating magnetic noise. One solution to this problem incorporates the use of a single ground conductor as a shield (see coax) and the use of multiple other separated internal conductors as positive signal wires inside a single shield conductor, allowing for several separate and distinct positive signals to all arrive at the amplifier input referenced to a single ground shield conductor. This method also insures that all the signal conductors and the single ground shield conductor (like coax) all experience similar induction of unwanted signals. Another solution is the incorporation of [...] "star topology" [...] signal grounding technique wherein no signal ground ever connects to any other signal ground, except at a single centralized location.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is often}} the case that {{electric}} hum at a venue is picked up via a ground loop. In this situation, an amplifier and a mixing desk are typically at some distance from one another. The chassis of each item is grounded via the mains earth pin, and is also connected along a different pathway via the conductor of a shielded cable. As these two pathways do not run alongside each other, an electrical circuit {{in the shape of a}} loop is formed. The same situation occurs between musical instrument amplifiers on stage and the mixing desk. To fix this, stage equipment often has a [...] "ground lift" [...] switch which breaks the loop. Another solution is to connect the source and destination through a 1:1 isolation transformer, called variously audio humbucker or iso coil. Another extremely dangerous option is to break contact with the ground wire by using an AC ground lift adapter or by breaking the earth pin off the power plug used at the mixing deck. Depending on the design and layout of the audio equipment, lethal voltages between the (now <b>isolated)</b> <b>ground</b> at the mixing desk and earth ground can then develop. Any contact between the AC line live terminals and the equipment chassis will energize all the cable shields and interconnected equipment.|$|E

40|$|DC {{flashover}} {{performance of}} ice-covered composite insulators with a parallel air gap (CI/PAG) {{is an important}} technical consideration when such insulators are used to <b>isolate</b> <b>ground</b> wires {{for the purpose of}} DC ice-melting.

The influences of parallel air gap, ice thickness, pollution severity and air pressure on DC negative 50 % flashover voltage (U 50 %) of CI/PAG were investigated. Test results show that the parallel air gap affected both the discharge path and U 50 %. With increasing ice thickness, U 50 % declined by up to 52 %; this effect was more evident when the breakdown occurred in the air gap. The pollution severity affected U 50 % only when the flashover happened along insulator surface. With a decrease of atmospheric pressure, U 50 % decreased. U 50 % and the ratio of air pressure were in a power function relationship with a positive characteristic exponent which was relevant to the discharge path...|$|R

50|$|The {{primary reason}} {{for the use of}} <b>isolated</b> <b>grounds</b> (IG) is to provide a noise-free ground return, {{separate}} from the equipment grounding (EG) return. The EG circuit includes all of the metal conduit, outlet boxes, and metal enclosures that contain the wiring and must be grounded to provide a safe return path in case of fault currents. The IG provides an insulated, separate ground path for the ground reference in electronic equipment, such as computers, hospital equipment, and audio equipment. IG does not break ground loops, which can damage equipment like computers, printers, etc.. Interconnected computer equipment often benefits from single-point grounding. IG is only used with special equipment that require it. The IG is typically insulated and separate {{all the way back to}} the point of earth grounding rod outside of the building. The IG is NOT connected neutral or any other. Due to the installation of a separate, insulated conductor and the associated special outlets required, IG circuits are more expensive to install than standard power circuits.|$|R
