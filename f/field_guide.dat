Virtual <b>Field</b> <b>Guides</b> are however underutilised and can offer students {{a different way of}} learning. Virtual <b>Field</b> <b>Guides</b> have many benefits to students, such as being more inclusive, building student skills and confidence in a controlled environment pre fieldtrip and can increase engagement in the topic studied. There are also benefits to the educator, such as reduced cost, more efficient students on fieldwork tasks and the ability to tailor and update their <b>field</b> <b>guides</b> to suit their needs. However there are drawbacks in the challenge of creation and their outcome as educational standalone tools. This paper reviews the literature around the benefits and draw backs to the creation and incorporation of virtual <b>field</b> <b>guides</b> in geoscience education.|$|R

5|$|In 1992, Rasmussen {{took the}} {{position}} of assistant to S.

When he became ill shortly after beginning the project, Rasmussen took over the project, and with artist John C. Anderton, produced , a two-volume bird guide for the Indian subcontinent which was the first <b>field</b> <b>guide</b> for the area to include sonograms. Volume 1 contains the <b>field</b> <b>guide</b> with over 3400 illustrations in 180 plates, and more than 1450 colour maps. Volume 2 (Attributes and Status) gives specimen measurements, data about identification, status, distribution and habits. Vocalizations are described from recordings, and there are over 1000 sonagrams.|$|E

25|$|The rise of <b>field</b> <b>guides</b> for the {{identification}} of birds was another major innovation. The early guides {{such as those of}} Thomas Bewick (2 volumes) and William Yarrell (3 volumes) were cumbersome, and mainly focused on identifying specimens in the hand. The earliest of the new generation of <b>field</b> <b>guides</b> was prepared by Florence Merriam, sister of Clinton Hart Merriam, the mammalogist. This was published in 1887 in a series Hints to Audubon Workers:Fifty Birds and How to Know Them in Grinnell's Audubon Magazine. These were followed by new <b>field</b> <b>guides</b> including classics by Roger Tory Peterson.|$|R
5|$|Leccinum manzanitae is edible, and its {{taste is}} {{sometimes}} rated highly, although others {{have described the}} flavor as bland. Drying the mushroom may improve the flavor. One <b>field</b> <b>guide</b> advises caution when selecting this species for the table, as there have been poisonings reported with similar-looking mushrooms found in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest region of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Leucopholiota decorosa is a {{saprobic}} species, deriving {{nutrients from}} decaying organic matter, particularly the rotting branches and stumps of deciduous trees. One <b>field</b> <b>guide</b> notes {{a preference for}} sugar maple. It grows singly or in bunches, clustered together {{at the base of}} the stem. In Ohio, it typically fruits from late September to mid November.|$|E
5|$|Mycena nargan {{has a very}} {{distinct}} appearance, and {{is unlikely}} to be mistaken for other Mycenas.

5|$|The edibility of {{the fruit}} bodies of Agaricus deserticola is not known definitively, and there are {{conflicting}} opinions in the literature, with some sources claiming that the edibility is unknown, and consumption should be avoided. However, one popular <b>field</b> <b>guide</b> to North American mushrooms suggests they are edible when they are young, and have a pleasant odor and mild taste.|$|E
5|$|Many of Baltimore's nightclubs {{and other}} local music venues are in Fells Point and Federal Hill. One music <b>field</b> <b>guide</b> points to Fell's Point's Cat's Eye Pub, Full Moon Saloon, Fletcher's Bar, and Bertha's as {{particularly}} notable, {{in addition to a}} number of others, most famously including the Sportsmen's Lounge, which was a major jazz venue in the 1960s, when it was owned by football player Lenny Moore.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Amanita atkinsoniana grow {{on the ground}} in mixed {{coniferous}} and deciduous forests. They have been collected in Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Vermont, and West Virginia. One <b>field</b> <b>guide</b> notes a preference for association with oak where there is ground cover of blueberry (Vaccinium) bushes. The mushroom has also been collected in Quebec, Canada. The southern extent of its range extends to the Mexican state of Michoacán. The mushroom fruits most commonly during late summer and fall after heavy rains.|$|E

It is not a history of ornithology but a natural history, a handbook or <b>field</b> <b>guide</b> systematically describing every species of bird known to occur in Britain. A separate article of about six pages, containing an image, a description, and an account of worldwide distribution, together with reports of behaviour, is provided for each species.|$|E

5|$|Disagreement {{exists as}} to whether Attalea should be {{considered}} a single genus, or a group of related genera. In their 1996 <b>Field</b> <b>Guide</b> to the Palms of the Americas, Andrew Henderson, Gloria Galeano and Rodrigo Bernal combined all the species in the subtribe Attaleinae (as it was then defined) into a single genus, Attalea. In his 1999 Taxonomic Treatment of Palm Subtribe Attaleinae, American botanist Sidney F. Glassman divided the group into five genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana, Scheelea and Ynesa. Rafäel Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised a single genus in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms, and Jean-Christophe Pintaud continued this usage in his 2008 review of the genus.|$|E
