40|$|This work explores a {{strategy}} for generating functional, three-dimensional (3 D) microstructures using (i) photolithography to fabricate micron-scale features, and (ii) self-assembly by spontane-ous folding to generate the 3 D structure.

On crimping this tape into a quasi- 3 D shape and joining it to a second flat tape, the structure becomes a linear, quasi- 3 D structure. In the second part, this structure is allowed to self-assemble into more complex 3 D structure by folding; this folding is driven by capillary interactions between the drops of solder.

50|$|Thermally {{oxidized}} silicon is {{a traditional}} substrate for OFETs where the silicon dioxide serves as the gate insulator.

This technique adopted a liquid based <b>dip-coat</b> method to mount very small amount of catalyst metals {{on the surface of}} the substrates with using Mo/Co bimetallic acetate solution. Merits of this approach lie in its easy, costless, and geometry-flexible nature compared with conventional sputtering and deposition approaches. We used alcohol catalytic CVD (ACCVD) method that can produce relatively high quality SWNTs even at low temperature down to 600 °C. This low temperature process contributes to the prevention of agglomeration of catalytic metals on the surface and chemical reaction between catalytic metal and silicon, which helps us to eliminate any kind of intermediating support materials. Thereby synthesized SWNTs on Si and quartz substrates under various CVD conditions are characterized by means of SEM, TEM, Raman scattering, and optical absorbance measurements.

The quality and diameter distribution of SWNTs were investigated and discussed through the results of Raman scattering and optical absorption. The average diameter of SWNTs was slightly smaller for SWNTs grown on zeolite particles compared with HiPco SWNTs. Finally, fluorescent emission spectra from isolated SWNTs in aqueous surfactant suspension were measured for variable excitation wavelength to determine the structural (n, m) distribution of SWNTs.

40|$|In {{this work}} we review our {{results on the}} preparation, {{characterization}} and testing of copper/ceria structured catalysts for CO abatement in H 2 -rich streams by preferential oxidation. Copper/ceria wash-coated monoliths were prepared by a modified dip coating procedure.

The role of the temperature profile on the performances was also studied and the dependence of thermal profile on the cell density and the wall thermal conductivity was shown. Monoliths with both high cell density and high thermal conductivity of the substrate represent the best option, providing a very good thermal management of the process due to the reduction of hot spots over the catalyst surface. On the other hand, wash-coat adhesion is significantly improved by the presence of nanometric ceria in the slurry used to <b>dip-coat</b> the monoliths, due to the partial penetration of the wash-coat into the substrate macropores.

40|$|Taking {{into account}} the {{influence}} of Si in osteoblast cell proliferation, a series of sol–gel derived silicon based coating was prepared by controlling the process parameters and varying the different Si-alkoxide precursors molar rate {{in order to obtain}} materials able to release Si compounds. For this purpose, methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMOS) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) were hydrolysed together and the sol obtained was used to <b>dip-coat</b> the different substrates. The silicon release ability of the coatings was tested finding that it was dependent on the TEOS precursor content, reaching a Si amount value around ninefolds higher for coatings with TEOS than for the pure MTMOS material. To test the effect of this released Si, the in vitro performance of developed coatings was tested with human adipose mesenchymal stem cells finding a significantly higher proliferation and mineralization on the coating with the higher TEOS content. For in vivo evaluation of the biocompatibility, coated implants were placed in the tibia of the rabbit and a histological analysis was performed. The evaluation of parameters such as the bone marrow state, the presence of giant cells and the fibrous capsule proved the biocompatibility of the developed coatings. Furthermore, coated implants seemed to produce a qualitatively higher osteoblastic activity and a higher number of bone spicules than the control (uncoated commercial SLA titanium dental implant).

ECTFE coating decreased the surface roughness reducing, as a consequence, the hydrophobicity of the membrane.

40|$|Background and aim Retinal pigment {{epithelium}} (RPE) is a monolayer, which lies on Bruch's membrane (BM) between neural retina and choriocapillaris. RPE has {{very important role}} maintaining vision and protecting underlying tissues. Age-related macular degeneration and other retinal disorders are often caused by RPE dysfunction, {{and there is no}} effective treatment available for them so far. However, human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) derived RPE cells can be transplanted to damaged retina providing a potential new treatment. Before heading to clinical applications, further research and optimization is needed. To mature hPSC-RPE cells successfully in vitro, the substrate and environment must mimic the natural extracellular matrix such as BM. This study pursued to optimize the best substrate for maturing hPSC-RPE cells using different coating protocols, materials and proteins. The aim of this project was to find better coating method for previously used one, which has unsatisfactorily supported hPSC-RPE attachment, proliferation and maturation. Methods There were two major phases in this study. First, laminin 521 (L 521) was coated with Langmuir-Schaefer (LS) method on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyimide (PI) membranes. The successfulness of the coatings and L 521 polymerization was investigated with immunostainings. Next, hPSC-RPE cells were passaged to the coatings and their attachment, spreading and pigmentation were observed for eight weeks. Finally, the cells were characterized with immunocytochemical stainings using confocal microscope z-stacks. In the second phase, the best substrate was searched with <b>dip-coat</b> (DC) method using collagen type IV (C-IV), L 521 and nidogen- 1 (Nid) as coating proteins. Different combinations of these proteins were tested on PET inserts. Cells were cultured on substrates 9 - 15 weeks. Dip-coatings and hPSC-RPE cells were analyzed and characterized as in first phase. Results LS-coated L 521 showed polymerization, especially on PI-membrane. hPSC-RPE cells grew on both LS-PET and LS-PI membranes expressing many crucial RPE immunomarkers. However, the maturation turned out to be slower compared to DC sample. C-IV + L 521 proved to be superior DC substrate combination compared to previously used simple C-IV coating. Furthermore, adding different concentrations of Nid to the combination increased progressively pigmentation and some of the immunomarker expressions. However, high Nid concentrations caused cell aggregates and erratic monolayer. Conclusions LS-technicque {{turned out to be a}} potential coating method by polymerizing laminin, but much more research and resources are still needed. DC C-IV + L 521 combination was superior compared to simple C-IV and the addition of Nid improves the maturation, however higher amounts of Nid cause adverse effects...|$|R
30|$|In control experiments, when <b>dip-coating</b> {{speed was}} {{increased}} {{to be higher}} than 80  μm s− 1 (e.g., 120  μm s− 1), non-continuous and defective nanoribbon arrays with inferior crystallinity were observed (Fig. S 2). In addition, if the <b>dip-coating</b> speeds were decreased to be lower than 30  μm s− 1 for BPEA or 60  μm s− 1 for TIPS-PEN, periodically aligned short nanoribbons were formed (Figs.  3 and 4). At lower lifting rates, gradual accumulation of organic semiconductors at the contact line made the meniscus too heavy, which induced an increase in the depinning force. As a result, the contact line would slip to a new position, leading to the formation of discontinuous nanoribbon arrays [39, 40]. All these results strongly suggest that the morphologies of nanoribbon arrays mainly depend on the <b>dip-coating</b> speed. In addition, to maintain a proper <b>dip-coating</b> speed, solvents with relatively low boiling point as well as good solubility are preferred, {{such as the use of}} dichloromethane as the solvent.|$|E
