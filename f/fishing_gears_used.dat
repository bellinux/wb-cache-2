40|$|In the Philippines, {{small-scale}} fishermen {{have traditionally}} relied on informal lenders {{in view of}} the limitations of self-finance and the lack of access to bank credit. An assessment of credit practices and its availability in 5 coastal communities: Culasi, San Jose, Concepcion, San Dionisio, and Nueva Valencia, was conducted from February to August 1990. Ninety-six percent of the respondents surveyed considered fishing as their major source of income with average earnings from fishing of P 1982 /month (25 Philippines Pesos = US$ 1.). Hook and line, gill net, jigger, and spear are the common <b>fishing</b> <b>gears</b> <b>used.</b> Credit was obtained by 83 % of the fishermen surveyed and was used mainly for food and household expenses, and fishing operations. Credit ranging from P 20 to P 20, 000 was obtained from informal or non-institutional sources, such as relatives, friends, small store owners, and traders. Informal credit sources were preferred over formal or institutional sources for the following reasons: accessibility (51 %), fast credit extension (31 %), liberal terms (25 %), and being only source known to the fisherman (18 %). Analysis showed that income has a highly significant linear correlation with amount of credit (r 2 = 0. 1311).

The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the fishing fleet in this area in terms of number of boats, economic situation, social aspects and impact on sea turtle specimens and target species. A multidisciplinary approach was essential to understand how the conservation problems of C. caretta are linked to various characteristics of the fishing fleet. Our data showed a vast discrepancy between the official census and the actual number of boats fishing in the area: 87 % of the observed artisanal vessels lacked a required registration number, and thus were fishing illegally. This has caused serious social problems that worsened over the summer of 2007, when the presence of non-local registered vessels, using drift nets, generated a spatial conflict with the local artisanal fishermen.

Data were from artisanal and recreational surveys carried out between 2006 and 2010.

A total of 87 species were caught by all artisanal fishing gears together (of which 84 % were retained and 16 % discarded). Recreational fishing caught 58 species of which none was systematically discarded.

Data collected were scored and the percentages of the parameters were calculated appropriately. The types of loans disbursed to beneficiaries revealed that 52 % was cash and 48 % was in kind. The credit package ranged between N 5, 000 to N 150, 000 only. Only 48 % of the loans granted were paid while the rest remained unpaid.

Operation of fishing gears is also an indication of economic condition of the fishermen community where they use locally available, less costly materials to make substances of technological delight giving maximum return. The paper describes wide range of traditional as well as modernized <b>fishing</b> <b>gears</b> <b>used</b> by subsistence and professional fishers in the River Ganga and their impact on the fisheries and ecosystem of the same. The minute mesh size fishing gears, like shooting gears used for the collection of spawns of the economically important fishes especially spawns of major carps, in breeding season also impacting the fisheries of the river. The use of this kind of fishing gears is also the major cause of sharp decline of the Indian Major Carps i. e. Catla catla, Labeo rohita, Cirrhinus mrigala and Labeo calbasu in the stretch of the river. The negative impacts indicate the need of season and time based regulation of specific type of fishing gear. An awareness/training programs should be extended amongst the fishermen to create awareness of the long-term effects of their fishing practices. The fishing gears are variously designed to suit the local conditions such as, depth of the water, prevalent current, seasons, and size of the desired fishes.

40|$|The European squid Loligo vulgaris is an {{important}} target species of commercial and recreational fisheries in the NW Mediterranean. Handline jigging {{is one of the}} most common <b>fishing</b> <b>gears</b> <b>used</b> by both of these fisheries to catch squid, which are trapped when they try to seize the lure with their tentacles. An unknown but possibly significant number of squid are able to escape from this gear by losing one or both of their tentacles (drop off rate). Between April and July 2010, two sets of experiments under controlled laboratory conditions were carried out to test (n= 15 squid) the indirect effects of tentacle loss on predation success and predation behaviour. The first set of experiments consisted of estimating the number of attacks and time spent until a squid with no (n= 5), one (n= 5) or two tentacles (n= 5) successfully caught a prey item. Independent trials were carried out with two prey types with very different swimming capabilities (fish and shrimp). The second set of experiments consisted of prey-selectivity trials to determine whether squid prefer fish or shrimp when both are available. The results obtained clearly demonstrate not only that squid missing tentacles have a reduced predation performance but also that they can change predation preferences and predation behaviour. These changes might negatively affect the condition of injured squid (reduced fitness). Consequently, the possibility of squid losing their tentacles deserves more attention in the management decisions for the squid fishery. This indirect handline jigging effect may imply unreported fishing mortality (ghost fishing) that should be considered when making management decisions for this important fishery. © 2011 Elsevier B.
