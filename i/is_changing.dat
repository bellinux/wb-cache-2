Ibn Yunus observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun's position for many years using a large astrolabe.|$|E
5|$|Capella {{has long}} been {{suspected}} to be slightly variable. Its amplitude of about 0.1 magnitudes means that it may at times be brighter or fainter than both Rigel and Vega, which are also slightly variable. The system has been classified as an RS Canum Venaticorum variable, a class of binary stars with active chromospheres that cause huge starspots, {{but it is still}} only listed as a suspected variable in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars. Unusually for RS CVn systems, the hotter star, Capella Ab, has the more active atmosphere because it is located in the Hertzsprung gap—a stage where it <b>is</b> <b>changing</b> its angular momentum and deepening its convection zone.|$|E
5|$|Faraday's and Ampère's work {{showed that}} a {{time-varying}} magnetic field acted {{as a source of}} an electric field, and a time-varying electric field was a source of a magnetic field. Thus, when either field <b>is</b> <b>changing</b> in time, then a field of the other is necessarily induced. Such a phenomenon has the properties of a wave, and is naturally referred to as an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves were analysed theoretically by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864. Maxwell developed a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric field, magnetic field, electric charge, and electric current. He could moreover prove that such a wave would necessarily travel at the speed of light, and thus light itself was a form of electromagnetic radiation. Maxwell's Laws, which unify light, fields, and charge are one of the great milestones of theoretical physics.|$|E

The various chapters of the book present selected studies that together illustrate how a more explicit focus on innovation and innovation theory can provide new insights into and generates knowledge about how media innova-tions develop, the sociocultural conditions of such innovations, the role of technology, and power relations in media developments...|$|R

5|$|In {{the context}} of a PPF, {{opportunity}} cost {{is directly related to the}} shape of the curve (see below). If the shape of the PPF curve is a straight-line, the opportunity cost is constant as production of different goods <b>is</b> <b>changing.</b> But, opportunity cost usually will vary depending on the start and end points. In the diagram on the right, producing 10 more packets of butter, at a low level of butter production, costs the loss of 5 guns (shown as a movement from A to B). At point C, the economy is already close to its maximum potential butter output. To produce 10 more packets of butter, 50 guns must be sacrificed (as with a movement from C to D). The ratio of gains to losses is determined by the marginal rate of transformation.|$|E

Determined {{to stay close}} to her husband, Terri takes a job as the school nurse, despite having no medical qualifications. She encourages Emma's boyfriend, football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) to propose to her, which he does. After asking Will if there is any reason she should not marry Ken, and being warned off Will by Terri, Emma accepts his proposal. Terri is still hiding the fact she experienced a hysterical pregnancy from Will, and upon realizing how much her life <b>is</b> <b>changing</b> due to her pregnancy, Quinn agrees to let Terri secretly adopt her baby.|$|E

5|$|In {{junior high}} school, they meet a tall, {{eccentric}} girl who befriends everyone named Chizuru Sarashina and her prickly friend Momoko Shirai, {{who does not}} get along well with the others—especially Saori. Eventually, Saori and Yoshino rejoin Shuichi's group of friends, though Saori says she still hates Yoshino and Momoko. Shuichi and Anna start dating, much {{to the surprise of}} their friends and Shuichi's sister. Yoshino and Saori manage to halfway repair their friendship, though Saori is still standoffish to others. Shuichi's friends are split up into several classes upon entering their second year in junior high school. Shuichi becomes friends with Shinpei Doi, who previously teased Shuichi about wanting to be a girl. Yoshino attends school in a boy's uniform for a short time, and Shuichi tries to go to school dressed as a girl one day, but is laughed at, and becomes discouraged. Shuichi's friends worry as Shuichi begins skipping school. Although Shuichi eventually starts attending school regularly again, Anna breaks off their relationship. By the time Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter their third year in junior high school, Shuichi's voice <b>is</b> <b>changing.</b> The group of friends start thinking about their future high school plans, and Shuichi and Anna start dating again.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, {{the black}} stork has been rated {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is {{because it has a}} large range—more than 20,000km2(7,700mi2)—and because its {{population}} is thought not to have declined by 30% over ten years or three generations and thus is not a rapid enough decline to warrant a vulnerable rating. Even so, the state of the population overall is unclear, and although it is widespread, it is not abundant anywhere. Black stork numbers have declined for many years in western Europe, and the species has already been extirpated from Scandinavia. The population in India—a major wintering ground—is declining. Previously a regular winter visitor to the Mai Po Marshes, it is now seldom seen there, and appears to be in decline in China overall. Its habitat <b>is</b> <b>changing</b> rapidly in much of eastern Europe and Asia. Various conservation measures have been taken, including Wetlands International's Conservation Action Plan for African black storks, which focuses on improving the wintering conditions of the birds which breed in Europe. It is protected by the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).|$|E
