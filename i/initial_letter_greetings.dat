40|$|In the {{previous}} sections we assumed for simplicity of exposition {{that there is}} just one letter in the reference dataset. However with the explosion of interest in digitizing cultural artifacts, there are now huge collections of carefully annotated <b>initial</b> <b>letters</b> online [10]. Moreover, these collections are growing constantly. For example, there are currently 6, 395 annotated <b>initial</b> <b>letters</b> in the “Virtual Library Humanist Program ” (VLHP) digital library [10], and there are numerous other digital libraries of historical manuscripts that have this scale of annotated <b>initial</b> <b>letters.</b> Given this, {{when we have a}} candidate unlabeled <b>initial</b> <b>letter</b> as a query, how can we quickly find its nearest neighbor in a large annotated <b>initial</b> <b>letter</b> dataset? The usual solution to such problems is to index the data [3][11]. However, as we have previously discussed, the CK 1 -measure is not amenable to most indexing techniques, given that it does not obey the triangular inequality and that no explicit features are extracted. We propose a simple but efficient algorithm to speed up the search. It exploits our novel lower bound, which we have previously shown to be useful for the complementary problem of reducing the number of candidates that need to be tested in the first place. The intuition behind our solution comes from observing the black pixel density distribution for the 6, 395 annotated <b>initial</b> <b>letters</b> for the VLHP archive [10]. In Fig. 1, we see that the black pixel density distribution for this large collection of annotated <b>initial</b> <b>letters</b> is approximately Gaussian. Moreover, and more importantly for us, the variance is relatively large...|$|R
