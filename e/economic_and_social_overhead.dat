40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the {{endogenous}} theory of time preference is extended to analyze those processes of capital accumulation {{and changes in}} environmental quality that are dynamically optimum {{with respect to the}} intertemporal preference ordering of the representative individual of the society in question. The analysis is carried out within the conceptual framework of the dynamic analysis of environmental quality, as has been developed by a number of economists for specific cases of the fisheries and forestry commons. The duality principles on intertemporal preference ordering and capital accumulation are extended to the situation where processes of capital accumulation are subject to the Penrose effect, which exhibit the marginal decrease in the effect of investment in private <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>overhead</b> capital upon the rate at which capital is accumulated. The dynamically optimum time-path of economic activities is characterized by the proportionality of two systems of imputed, or efficient, prices, one associated with the given intertemporal ordering and another associated with processes of accumulation of private <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>overhead</b> capital. It is particularly shown that the dynamically optimality of the processes of capital accumulation involving both private <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>overhead</b> capital is characterized by the conditions that are identical with those involving private capital, with the role of <b>social</b> <b>overhead</b> capital only indirectly exhibited...|$|R

50|$|Although the UDHR of 1948 {{includes}} <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> {{rights in}} Articles 22-27, {{civil and political}} rights are the main focus of the document. It is suggested that this lack of original representation in the UDHR is {{due to a lack of}} consensus on what <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> rights are, their universality and their validity in international law.The creation of the International Covenant on <b>Economic,</b> <b>Social</b> <b>and</b> Cultural rights was also met with much criticism surrounding the implementation of these rights into international law. First, critics argued, and some still exist today, that <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> rights could not and should not be put into international law because they were incapable of being assessed by a court of law. Second, critics state that <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> rights suffer from an inability to be immediately implemented. Finally, critics argue that unlike {{civil and political rights}} that can be more easily provided, <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> rights require much positive action significantly with resources and time.Yet, although the debate on the validity of <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> rights is still present, the existence <b>and</b> status of <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> rights in international law has been consolidated and is unquestionable. It is now consistently stressed in international human rights law, though not always enforced in practice by states, that <b>economic,</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> cultural rights are indivisible from civil and political rights whereby one right cannot be enjoyed without the others. Most importantly, the world will only continue to move into an era of globalization and development that will put <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> rights at the forefront of international and national law.|$|R
