40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{understand}} how 35 <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> in a No Excuses high school, a charter school model designed to promote social mobility, made decisions about if and where to go to college. This study draws on college choice, cultural capital, and performance management literature {{to understand how}} the high school context at the focal school influenced students 2 ̆ 7 college choice processes. Drawing on data from interviews, observations, and documents, this exploratory study found that Performance High provided extensive college resources and support to its students, which was consistent with how researchers conceptualize a 2 ̆ 2 college-going culture 2 ̆ 2 in high schools. Further, the high school used a performance management approach, in which administrators held teachers and students accountable for meeting particular college related metrics, such as the number and types of applications students were required to submit. The study found that <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> submitted applications and enrolled in college at high rates. Thirty-four of the 35 <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> planned to attend college the following fall. However, rather than exhibit the sense of entitlement and expectation that research describes for students who benefit from dominant forms of cultural capital, most of the <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> 2 ̆ 7 college choice processes were characterized by hesitation, ambivalence, and doubt. Further, the findings suggest the performance management approach assimilated students to one model of college choice that did not easily accommodate students 2 ̆ 7 preferences. These findings highlight the difficulties for schools in providing cultural capital for students independent of their families, and suggests the need to reconceptualize 2 ̆ 2 college-going cultures 2 ̆ 2 to not only consider the college outcomes and the density of resources in the high school context, but how well students absorb cultural capital, which may be important for social mobility. ...|$|E
40|$|While {{much has}} been written about the {{efficacy}} of academic support programs for increasing the retention rates of university students deemed academically underprepared, few studies examine how students engage the support classroom with an emphasis on expressions of literacy. This qualitative study responds to recent calls in student development literature for more studies into particular practices of university support programs. Focused on an exemplar support program at a larger, public university in the American Midwest, the study gathered perspectives about the support of academically underprepared students, teasing out the differences in administrators 2 ̆ 7, instructors 2 ̆ 7, and students 2 ̆ 7 voices. Insights from the perspectives revealed that explicit metaphors of support in the programmatic discourse emphasized a skills model for academic development and a utopian model of student safe houses. In the classroom, however, five <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> suggested that literacy learning was far more complex. In particular, students 2 ̆ 7 data revealed the generative potential of sociocultural literacy theory for conceptualizing praxis in an academic support program. Examining how five <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> responded to the complex programmatic perspectives of support showed that student engagement was far more intricate than strong retention rates. First, a close analysis of five <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> revealed that learning academic discourses was more than appropriation of skills; it was ways of discerning which practices to use for different communities and learning to signal one 2 ̆ 7 s role in these communities. Second, students revealed that student community in the support program was a borderland of difference rather than a safe house. Finally, students illustrated that opportunities for creative improvisation in literacy performances was integral to student engagement. The findings have insights for how to conceptualize pedagogy in support programs related to emergent sociocultural theories of Third Space. Specifically, imagining the support classroom as borderland play suggests that the how of student engagement was often how the five <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> proactively co-constructed the learning...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates how low-resource {{high schools}} support (or not) high achieving, low-income students {{depending on how}} they enact college readiness agendas. My study was motivated {{by the lack of}} empirical research in two areas—how college readiness policies are being actualized for high achieving, low-income students and how these students leverage network ties to their schools, families, and communities to access college. I conducted a longitudinal case study analysis of twenty <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> attending two low-resource high schools in the Denver area. Data were analyzed with a new construct—college-going capital—that I developed from aspects of social capital (Bourdieu, 1986) and community cultural wealth (Yosso, 2005). I present three key findings: (1) one school focused on preparing students for careers first and college second, often in large group settings. Unless the <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> actively sought out staff, they had a hard time navigating the college readiness agenda at their school and accessing college. (2) The other school focused on preparing all students beginning in ninth grade for college and created a college readiness agenda that facilitated multiple connections between students and institutional agents. Nonetheless, many of the <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> faced barriers in accessing specific programs. (3) Although both schools took a deficit perspective towards their students, the <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> drew upon many valuable resources of college-going capital outside of school via network ties to families (familial capital) and to peers and community members (communal capital). These findings are particularly useful in a time in which the opportunity gap is only widening among high- and low-income students who have college aspirations. Amidst reduced funding and pressure to meet state accountability measures, low-resource high schools often have few resources to commit to college readiness agendas that cultivate the necessary social networks their students need in order to access college. Yet my findings suggest that high achieving low-income students will benefit if their schools (1) implement college readiness initiatives that facilitate individual connections, (2) ensure that students have multiple opportunities to connect to college-linking programs, and (3) recognize and leverage the college-going capital that their students access outside of school...|$|E

Mayo, Jr., 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 202 pages, appendices A-I. This dissertation examines the discourses around gender present among {{a cohort of}} preservice secondary social studies teachers (n= 25) and how gender discourses manifested throughout their preparatory year with particular interest paid to their thoughts about curricula, schools, and students. Using ethnographic study design, the author presents three significant moments that occurred throughout their preparatory year, and, for three <b>focal</b> <b>students,</b> interviews which occurred {{in their first year}} of teaching. Data include transcripts of three class sessions, completed assignments, reflective journals, and interviews. Building upon Thornton's (1991) work on teachers as "curricular-instructional gatekeepers," the author explores what guided the curricular decision making for the participants and, for the <b>focal</b> <b>students,</b> what discourses they decided to make space for in their first classrooms. Because gender is socially constructed, it is important for future teachers to examine what has contributed to the construction of their own gendered identities {{in order for them to}} be able to see how they as individuals and as members of a larger group contribute to the greater society. Through feminist poststructural discourse analysis, the author finds multiple and competing discourses around the gendered topics of sexual violence and how the students expressed their own genders as connected to culture. Intersections of race and social class with gender and the presence of emotion were important in how the students talked about gender. Also found was the uneven follow-through of implementing practices learned in their teacher education coursework in their first classrooms, and the reluctance of two <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> to include Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) topics in their first classrooms. Additionally, the role of context is considered as essential to the students' decision whether to self-censor...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} how scoring with feedback in formative assessment affects learning in an English {{as a foreign}} language (EFL) writing classroom. Two EFL writing classes were compared: in one class, teacher feedback was given to students on initial drafts, and scores were given {{only at the end}} of the semester; in the second class, teacher feedback and scores were given to students on each draft throughout the semester. This study adopted a mixed-methods approach, including a statistical analysis to explore whether teacher feedback accompanied by scoring makes a difference in student writing, and observation, and interviews of <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> to examine how feedback with scores affects students’ perceptions and attitudes towards writing. The results reveal that the scoring class wrote more accurately than the non-scoring class and that the <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> in the scoring class were not only more aware of both their own and their classmates’ performances, but that they also made efforts to emulate the students they considered effective writers.

40|$|This {{small-scale}} ethnographic {{research study}} investigated student perceptions of social identity and {{agency and the}} usefulness of the construct of the Community of Practice for struggling writers {{in the context of a}} pre-university EAP program. The appropriateness of socio-cultural theories in language teaching and learning today stems from social constructivist and social interactionist theories of the role of language in the discursive construction of society, knowledge and power. This study problematised these constructs in the development of writing for learners in a pre-university Higher Education context. Comparing data from <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> who were struggling with writing and from students who were more successful, the biographies of struggling students and their awareness of their futures, or imagined selves and communities, revealed not only learning histories in which they had radically different identities as learners and writers, but also a lack of clarity about their learning trajectory in the writing program. There was no apparent lack of investment in learning among the <b>focal</b> <b>students,</b> who identified themselves as weak writers, although there was frustration and anger at their predicament. The data suggest that they did not identify with the learning community at the start of the project, probably because they resisted belonging to a community which labeled them as failures. During the study a variety of means were used to elicit participants’ perceptions of their status as novice writers and to support their learning trajectory on an individual basis by elucidating the reasons for and requirements of academic writing. By the end of the study the <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> had developed more awareness of the subject positions the writing trajectory afforded them and had chosen ways in which to continue along their learning path.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} storytelling in learning to teach, exploring the stories one student teacher composed and used {{to make sense of}} daily experiences in the classroom and the ways they contributed to developing understandings of teaching. In it, I analyze how learning to teach involves storytelling, and the ways story modes and forms help create teaching lives rife with particular commitments. I asked: What stories of teaching, learning, and students emerge as student teachers make sense of daily events in a variety of discursive settings? What, and who, influences the construction of student teacher stories? And what consequences do novice teachers’ constructions of teaching stories have for their work and interactions with students, especially with regard to stories of culturally and linguistically diverse students? Drawing on narrative theory and post structural, feminist theories, I conducted a case study using narrative inquiry and ethnographic methods to examine the moment-to-moment storytelling of one student teacher across a range of informal and formal teaching and learning contexts. Data included participant observation, audio-video recording of seminars, teaching observations, teaching debriefs, triad meetings, the <b>focal</b> <b>student</b> teacher’s written blog, and artifacts collected from the student teaching classroom and university coursework. Using an analytic framework that looked at story themes; discourse styles; storytelling moves; and the role of co-authors, analysis focused on narrative themes and contradictions across time and settings. For the <b>focal</b> <b>student</b> teacher, initial story themes of agency, a desire to be open to learning in the experience, and a tendency to trouble success/failure binaries made way for conversational sense-making that often linked difficulties to a variety of possible solutions early in the semester, and a teaching story focused on instructional adaptation by mid-semester, which continued to evolve. The conceptual and practical tools available in the setting and the ways she positioned herself and was positioned by her mentors influenced the student teacher’s stories. Findings also include the ways common stories and storytelling moves influenced teaching decisions and perceptions of students. Implications for teacher education are discussed...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2015. Major: Education, Curriculum and Instruction. Advisors: Diane Tedick, Tara Fortune. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiv, 253 pages. Spanish dual-language immersion {{programs in the}} U. S. increasingly work with both English and Spanish home language students who bring {{a wide variety of}} linguistic resources. One important approach to adapting to this linguistic diversity in immersion schools may be to differentiate support for student language development during content instruction. This paper explores a collaborative design-based study on the efficacy of instructional practices that afford increased student oral proficiency development through language-focused differentiated instruction. The school site was a grade-three classroom in an urban two-way Spanish immersion school that included students from a variety of home language backgrounds. Students from one classroom (n= 24) were assessed for oral proficiency using the Student Oral Proficiency Assessment from the Center for Applied Linguistics. <b>Focal</b> <b>student</b> language production was evaluated with attention to complexity measures at the beginning of and end of the semester-long study. <b>Focal</b> <b>student</b> interactional discourse, as well as teacher and student interviews were analyzed in relation to linguistic diversity and differentiation using constructs from interactional sociolinguistics including authentication, intertextuality and adequation/distinction. Findings suggest that 1) students increased their language complexity as measured by number of different words, mean length of utterance, and subordination. 2) Students appeared to increase their participation in relation to their engagement with the target language structures, their exposure to increasingly complex language, and their developing awareness of how language works. 3) The classroom teacher's perception of linguistic diversity shifted to become less focused on "native speakers" and his conceptualization of "attention to language" changed from a focus on form to an exploration of functional options to facilitate student interaction. Teacher-identified "socially sanctioned niches" became safe spaces for students to engage with language play that reinforced their developing bilingual identities as students negotiated their relationships and made sense of content. Design and implementation of language-focused differentiated instruction is likely to promote linguistic development {{to the extent that it}} can afford (or constrain) the local emergence of bilingual identities in connection with increased language awareness, exposure to a wider variety of complex shared texts from which to draw, and access to increased participation within academic learning experiences...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} examines inclusive {{practices for}} students with high functioning autism and Asperger’s Syndrome in mainstream classrooms, {{as well as the}} implementation of these practices. The theoretical background of the concept of inclusive practices has been informed by sociocultural notions of learning and development and research on Autism Spectrum Disorders, in particular the implications of the condition for learning and social interactions. The concept of inclusive practices is situated in the contexts of research on special education, the practice of labeling students with special needs in schools, and the policies, concepts and practices of inclusion in mainstream schools in North America. The primary goal of the research was to reflect on how sociocultural concepts of learning and development can help in the design of curriculum and practices that support the learning and socialization of students with autism in mainstream classrooms. The findings are evaluated also from the perspective of research on and ongoing debates concerning special education and inclusion, attempting to contribute to our understanding of issues such as the continuum of services, the principle of the least restrictive environment, and full inclusion. Two children with high functioning autism and Asperger’s Syndrome, both fully included in mainstream classrooms, were the <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> of the research.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} synchronous text-based computer-mediated communication (SCMC) tasks may affect English as a Second Language (ESL) learners 2 ̆ 7 development of second language (L 2) and academic literacy. The study {{is motivated by}} two issues concerning the use of SCMC tasks in L 2 writing classes. First, {{although some of the}} alleged benefits of SCMC, including its visual saliency and the possibility of slower processing speed, have been supported by theories of Second Language Acquisition (SLA), more evidence is still needed since empirical studies have not yet produced enough consistent findings. Second, most studies on SCMC have focused on its influence on learners 2 ̆ 7 development of basic communicative competence while {{it has been suggested that}} SCMC may hold great potential for the development of advanced academic literacy (Luo, 2005; Mohan 2 ̆ 6 Luo, 2005) that is considered as an essential goal for L 2 writing classes. Therefore, the dissertation addresses these issues using mixed methods research completed in two phases. A quasi-experiment was conducted in the first phase among forty-four international students enrolled in two sections of an ESL academic writing course to examine the differential effects of SCMC and face-to-face tasks. The differential effects were assessed by comparing the students 2 ̆ 7 improvement on measures of L 2 grammatical and lexical complexity, accuracy, and fluency (Wolfe-Quintero, Inagaki, 2 ̆ 6 Kim, 1998) from a pre-test to a post-test. The results of the quasi-experiment were also used to help select representative <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> for the multiple case studies in the second phase where the SCMC discourse of the <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> was examined for the details of L 2 learning and the development of academic literacy. In analyzing the SCMC discourse of different triads, instances of L 2 learning opportunities based on the Interaction approach and sociocultural theory of L 2 learning were identified and classified, and the patterns of learning for each triad and between triads were discussed. The SCMC discourse was then re-analyzed to examine how the <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> developed their ability to construct effective arguments by participating in the back-and-forth rhetoric and by learning to use meta-discourse devices appropriately. The patterns of learning observed in the SCMC discourse of the <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> were also compared with the patterns observed from their writing samples. The quasi-experiment and the multiple case studies were connected by a mixed methods research design (Creswell 2 ̆ 6 Plano Clark, 2007, p. 73) whose aim was to understand how SCMC tasks might affect both the outcome and the processes of the development of L 2 and academic literacy. The results largely confirmed the benefits of SCMC tasks on L 2 written accuracy and fluency, and suggested that SCMC tasks had great positive potential in engaging students in the processes of arguments to help them learn to incorporate discussions of opposing views in building effective arguments. Future research may further examine the differences of learning between pairs, triads, or small groups working on the same SCMC task. Research on the use of SCMC tasks and the learning of meta-discourse devices can also inform pedagogical decisions...|$|E

40|$|Thousands of Mexican {{students}} commute from Mexico to the United States {{each day}} to attend school. South San Diego's transfronterizo, or cross-border, students (most U. S. citizens) offer a colorful microcosm of the greater diversity evident in American schools. But {{little is known about}} this phenomenon of transfronterizos. The topic demands penetrating research to understand how we can effectively help these students navigate the U. S. education system and routes into higher education. The shift from middle to high school is a critical life transition, particularly for students who were previously educated south of the border, and now endeavor to traverse two countries, two languages, two cultures, and two education systems. This study focuses on the educational experiences of eight students attending a public high school in South San Diego. Each of the <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> crosses the border on a daily or weekly basis from Tijuana, Baja California to attend school in the United States. Drawing on the causal accounts and conceptual tools of social capital theory, my research describes the journeys of these savvy adolescents and seeks to explain how the social ties they variably develop contribute to their comparative success in high school and to seeking admission to college. Through qualitative research, I detail the relative strength of each student’s social ties and networks by moving from three elements of social capital theory: 1) network formation, 2) information channels with regard to obtaining knowledge about college, and 3) trust of peers and adults. I also explore parents’ own knowledge, networks, and social capital through interviews regarding their education and career, expectations of their children, and information channels. In addition, a comparative analysis focuses on the knowledge of college requirements and course selection strategies of <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> relative to a comparison group of peers: bilingual Latino students who have never lived or attended school in Mexico. The comparison allows me to determine if the knowledge and social capital that transfronterizo students build over time resembles that of students living locally. The state university systems in California require that at least 11 college-preparatory courses be completed in high school, known as A-G coursework. I discover that <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> have different academic experiences and varying knowledge of the A-G requirements, largely based on whether they are in the AVID program – a selective initiative that acquaints chosen students with college preparation and downstream options. For the most part, AVID enrollment is granted to students who have an above average GPA. I detail the informal, unwritten criteria for gaining access to this pivotal program at one San Diego high school, and then link students’ social networks and capital to resources and ties fostered by the AVID program. I also find that trust among peers does not translate into obtaining thick information about college. Befriending other students who have college-oriented expectations often determine whether they pursue greater knowledge about university requirements. Parents of <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> are generally uninformed about the A-G requirements, financial aid options, and high-stakes tests such as the SAT and ACT. Focal parents’ work schedules and residence in Tijuana makes it nearly impossible to attend workshops held at school. None of the focal parents’ own social networks and capital facilitate much knowledge about college or how to effectively maneauver through high school. The results of this study have implications for research in transnationalism, education, and U. S. -Mexico border relations. The complexity and uniqueness of each student’s journey to the U. S. for a quality education is a call for understanding the characteristics and needs of cross-border students along the U. S. -Mexico border. In addition, because of the porous nature of the border – e. g., students living in one country and attending school in another or the obligations the students have {{on both sides of the}} border – policymakers could learn a great deal about transfronterizo students engaging in transnational education practices...|$|E

[...] University of Washington, 2012 Decades of {{research}} document underperformance of Latino/a youth in mathematics, yet {{little is known}} about the day-to-day mathematics socialization of Latino/a youth. This research used qualitative case studies of two Algebra 1 classrooms and seven Latino/a <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> to document and describe two major influences on Latino/a youths' mathematics identities: their individual beliefs and their negotiation of identity in classroom settings. I proposed a three-tiered framework for mathematics identity drawing on students' self-concepts, sociocultural learning theory, and Critical Race Theory (CRT) to research the perspectives Latino/a students had about their own mathematics identities. This study focused on how Latino/a students described the role of language and race in learning mathematics, how Latino/a youth exhibited agency in their mathematics educations, and the role of different features of mathematics classrooms in negotiating their mathematics identities. Findings from students' perspectives suggest racial identity plays a role in the mathematics identity negotiation for Latino/a students in complex ways. Some students readily named stereotypes around Asian students as being high achieving, and then positioned Latino/as as lower achieving. Linguistic identity played a key role in how one pair of <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> in each classroom engaged in strategic partnerships and how they displayed agency [...] for one student in her own mathematics identity, and for the other student in an attempt to help her partner learn algebra. The findings from the classroom analysis suggest that attending to multiple aspects of classroom practice can provide insight into how Latino/a youth negotiate their mathematics identities in classrooms, and that the proposed aspects of classroom practice may be a useful analytic framework for classroom research. The findings contribute to important dimensions to attend to in the mathematics identity development and classroom socialization experiences of Latino/a youth, and highlight the potential value of CRT in research on mathematics identity. The frameworks proposed could contribute to equity projects focused on the experiences of Latino/a youth and youth from other communities historically marginalized by schooling...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine how the {{processes}} and different activities that adolescent English L 2 writers engage in producing multimodal texts influence the development of their multimodal and writing competence. This dissertation fills existing gaps regarding how multimodal pedagogies are implemented in L 2 contexts to facilitate adolescent L 2 writers ’ development of writing and multimodal competence. The research was conducted in an English classroom within a junior high school (JHS) located in a small village in southern Ghana. Forty-eight second year JHS students (the equivalent of 8 th grade) participated in the study; three of these were selected as <b>focal</b> <b>students.</b> Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected concurrently through an embedded, developmental case study design, with the quantitative data playing a supportive role. Data collected through this design included surveys, multiple drafts of students ’ expository texts, posters, poster presentations, guided reflections and text-based interviews. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data showed that th...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} a {{qualitative}} case study conducted to investigate the oral and written language proficiency of an Indonesian bilingual child living in The Ohio State, USA. There were three research questions guiding this study as follows: (1) how the bilingual Indonesian child used the languages she spoke in oral and written forms?, (2) how was the child’s oral proficiency for each language she spoke?, and (3) how was the child’s written language proficiency for each language she spoke? The data {{in this study were}} gathered through analytical observation sheets, semi structured interviews, audio and video recording and transcriptions, and reading aloud and writing scoring. Then, the data were analyzed using inductive analysis such as doing field work to observe and recording the data, developing topics and categorizing the data into categories, refining and coding the data into more specific patterns to see the themes of the data, and seeking for narrative structures and visual representations. Based on the results of the study, there were three points concluded. First, my <b>focal</b> <b>student</b> and her community chose different languages to communicate based on the listeners’ cultural background, age, and gender. Second, the Indonesian parents living there had an awareness of the importance of heritage language in spoken and written forms. Third, the student’ oral and written language proficiency in English were higher than in Indonesian and Javanese. In conclusion, the student needed more space for developing her abilities in Indonesian and Javanese. Keywords: bilingual, bilingualism, biliteracy, language proficienc...|$|R
40|$|This 2 -year {{qualitative}} study explores the ironies of educational {{reform in the}} United States as experienced by three second language learners attending a school attempting to transform itself into a high-performance elementary school in California 2 ̆ 7 s Silicon Valley. Drawing {{on the concept of}} “fast capitalism” in a globalized economic work order (Gee, Hull, 2 ̆ 6 Lankshear, 1996) and the tools of critical discourse analysis (Fairclough, 1989), the findings from this investigation reveal that the discourses of school reform in the United States visibly and invisibly placed second language learners in new highly vulnerable positions. In what follows I provide an analysis of this vulnerability by relating the experiences of three families and their attempts to enrol and stay enrolled in the school of their choice. Next, I provide a critical analysis of the discourses of reading and writing instruction and of a text produced by a <b>focal</b> <b>student</b> named Alma in this context. This analysis highlights the ways in which classroom literacy practices inadvertently constrained the efforts of second language learners to acquire academic literacies and ultimately legitimated the school 2 ̆ 7 s decision to declare Alma “not Web material. ” The implications of this study relate to better understanding classroom SLA from a historical, institutional perspective and to supporting teachers and policy makers in addressing the needs of second language learners in a time of rapid social and economic change...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} case study of analytical writing and identity development among diverse, ninth grade adolescents enrolled in an alternative high school preparatory academy. Within the larger school context, the study examines the case of the writing classroom—specifically, the four-month literary analysis unit—and the students’ writing development therein. First, I analyze the discourse of the writing classroom on developing interpretative statements about literature. Analysis shows that the teacher highlighted three aspects of literary reasoning to support five specific expectations for writing a literary interpretation. In particular, the teacher emphasized that students deepen their interpretative statements by analyzing literary techniques and themes. Second, I examine analytical essays to identify trends in student writing development over time. I show that students had to adopt a particular stance toward literary analysis {{in order to meet the}} teacher’s increasing calls to make deeper interpretative statements —a stance that posed tensions for some students. Third, I analyze the data of eight <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> to explore those tensions. I show that students adopted one of three stances toward the discourse and use three <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> to describe those stances. Abraham ventriloquated through the discourse (i. e., he appropriated heuristics without full control over them) while Katarina passed on the discourse (i. e., she upheld personal observations of characters as points of connection to literary analysis), and Kianna made the discourse internally persuasive (i. e., she actively merged the discourse goals with her communicative goals). This dissertation further explores the cultural, historical, and social factors informing the students’ stances and reveals how the internalization of a new discourse is highly variable and deeply personal. These findings complicate contemporary understandings of writing development as either the refinement of cognitive processes or the layered interactions of writer, culture and context. It also demonstrates the utility of using both sociocognitive and identity lenses to study the ways diverse adolescents take up dominant discourses within particular classroom contexts. Finally, the study raises questions about what it means when teachers ask students to adapt to dominant discourses without also providing them the space to adapt the discourse to meet their communicative needs...|$|E
40|$|Qualitative {{research}} methods guide {{data collection and}} analysis (Bogdan & Biklen, 2007; Dyson & Genishi, 2005; Heath & Street, 2008; Schram 2006) of this 18 month study researching the academic lives of 21 Spanish-English language learners classified as limited English proficient (LEP) in two urban, elementary school communities. In this dissertation, I argue language learners in elementary school begin to construct identities with language through the school community resources they are able to access as they participate in school-based activities. These language identities are related to students' engagement and motivation to participate in school, and also hold a relationship with students' language classification status. By triangulating the data of 21 <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> to include: 1) student interviews, 2) observations of students in academic and non-academic school activities, and 3) students' performance on academic tests, findings reveal how all language learners construct one of three language-learning identities - dual, separation, or distant - where a distant identity is associated with students who remain classified LEP or are reclassified as a long-term English language learner upon exiting elementary school...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} if peer relations affect a student?s risk of early school-leaving. We use the sociometric data collection from the Dutch "Secondary Education Pupil Cohort 1999 " to identify peer relations {{in a sample}} of almost 20, 000 students in the first grade of secondary education (mean age 13). This information is matched to data on educational attainment from 1999 to 2010 for these students, to measure later early school-leaving by both the <b>focal</b> <b>students</b> as well as their peers. Our results show that both being friends with future early school-leavers as well as popularity among future early schoolleavers increases the risk of students to be early school-leavers later in their educational career while other characteristics of the peer group such as gender composition, ethnic composition, average (non) cognitive skills and average socioeconomic background have no effects on the risk of early schoolleaving. And while characteristics like gender, ethnicity and socio-economic background {{play an important role in}} peer selection, the future dropout status does not have a major impact on peer selection. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} one way {{in which}} students can develop durable local identities in science classrooms. When students enter new classrooms or lab groups their identities are indeterminate, to varying degrees. Over time, however, students and teachers generally come to identify a given student in robust and predictable ways. The process of developing a stable local identity is intertextual. A more durable identity emerges across events, as signs of identity come to presuppose a consistent trajectory of identification that extends across events. The various trajectories of identification that an individual could have traveled normally get narrowed down, as events of identification become indexically linked along a more rigid trajectory. Such objectification of identity across a trajectory is only provisional, however, as aspects of identity can solidify and then change across events as well. This paper traces the social identification of one student across the course of a two month curriculum unit, showing how he developed a complex but robust identity across several weeks in a new lab group. The analysis first describes entextualization within classroom events, showing how the <b>focal</b> <b>student</b> was positioned in increasingly recognizable ways over a few minutes in one lab group activity. Then it traces the student’s emerging trajectory across many such events, showing how his identity solidifies, and in some respects becomes fluid again, as he gets identified across events. The paper also shows how this solidification depends on conceptual and physical resources particular to science classrooms, including resources drawn from the curriculum. Thus the paper shows {{one way in}} which the objectification of academic subject matter and the objectification of classroom identities can interrelate, when the solidification of social identity is facilitated by academic resources...|$|R
40|$|This study explores {{theoretical}} and pedagogical implications of space, language, {{and power in}} renegotiating identity for immigrant English Language Learners (ELLs) in secondary schools in the United States. The primary research question explored in the study is: How does spoken and written language and discourse shape the production of third spaces for renegotiating immigrant student identity in the ELL writing classroom? I adopt an epistemological lens of space from a postmodern geographic perspective that contends that space is socially produced and is co-constituted by material, abstract and lived spaces. The theoretical framework draws on constructs of social space, space-time, and the chronotope propose reconsideration of third spaces for immigrant ELLs. The context {{of the study is}} an intermediate ELL writing classroom designed around immigrant students developing academic and critical literacy grounded in their lived spaces of immigration. The methodology employed combines ethnography of the classroom space with critical discourse analysis of critical spatial events that are analyzed as moments of spatial production. Ethnographic narrative of the classroom space, governed by guiding concepts of critical literacy and shared behavioral norms, centers on the focal immigration unit in which student immigration narratives provide overarching chronotopes of immigrant student identities. Analysis of classroom spatial production highlights tensions in social space that are mediated by language, discourse and communication surrounding immigrant identities. Transcript analysis of critical spatial events traces intersecting space-times at global, local and micro-local scales of classroom discourse. Findings from ethnographic case study of one immigrant Latino male, who aspires to become a hip hop DJ, illustrate how hip hop discourses frame the chronotope of immigration and represent a shared third space between the teacher and <b>focal</b> <b>student.</b> This study contributes new ideas in theory and research methods by operationalizing third spaces for immigrant ELL student. Implications also follow for curriculum and instruction rooted in lived spaces of experience and for critical reflective practice for educators. ...|$|R
