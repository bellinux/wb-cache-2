Representing <b>fuzzy</b> <b>information</b> in a machine understandable way and reasoning them efficiently can make a GSR system more practical and robust. This paper proposes an innovative fuzzy geospatial ontology model, FGSO, to represent and reason <b>fuzzy</b> geospatial <b>information.</b> In FGSO, the complex fuzzy semantic of spatial relations are described explicitly by a fuzzy spatial relation ontology which also carries out fuzzy spatial reasoning; a fuzzy geospatial ontology based on the fuzzy ontology language, f-SHIF(D), is developed to represent a variety of geospatial information besides spatial relations in a uniform format, and its reasoning module integrates the two ontologies to mine more information.

As a solution to these problems, we proposed a methodology in [l], [Z] that represents and processes <b>fuzzy</b> <b>information</b> at the coarse granular level.

40|$|A {{cognitive}} system is presented, {{which is based}} on coupling a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> system. The aim of the system is to identify optimal solutions for multiple criteria that involve linguistic concepts, and to systematically identify a most suitable solution among the alternatives. The cognitive features are formed by the integration of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> for knowledge representation and evolutionary multi-objective optimization resulting in a decision-making outcome among several equally valid options. Cognition is defined as final decision-making based not exclusively on optimization outcomes but also some higher-order aspects, which do not play role in the pure optimization process. By doing so, the decisions are not merely subject to rationales of the computations but they are the resolutions with the presence of environmental considerations integrated into the computations. The work describes a novel fuzzy system structure serving for this purpose and a novel evolutionary multi-objective optimization strategy for effective Pareto-front formation serving for the goal. The machine cognition is exemplified by means of a design example, where a number of objects are optimally placed according to a number of architectural criteria.

40|$|A fuzzified Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) -type {{recurrent}} fuzzy network (FTRFN) {{for handling}} <b>fuzzy</b> temporal <b>information</b> is proposed in this paper. The FTRFN extends our previously proposed network, TRFN, {{to deal with}} fuzzy temporal signals represented by Gaussian or triangular fuzzy numbers. In the precondition part of FTRFN, matching degrees between input fuzzy variables and fuzzy antecedent sets is performed by similarity measure. In the TSK-type consequence, a linear combination of fuzzy variables is computed, where two sets of combination coefficients, one for {{the center and the}} other for the width of each fuzzy number, are used. Derivation of the linear combination results and final network output is based on left-right fuzzy number operation.

FTRFN can he applied on a variety of domains related to <b>fuzzy</b> temporal <b>information</b> <b>processing.</b> In this paper, it has been applied on one-dimensional and two-dimensional fuzzy temporal sequence prediction and CCD-based temporal gesture recognition.

Solving a complex problem, via a granular computing approach, means splitting the problem into information granules and handling each granule as a whole.

40|$|The {{development}} of fuzzy sets in geographic information systems (GIS) arose {{out of the}} need to handle uncertainty and the ability of soft computing technology to support <b>fuzzy</b> <b>information</b> <b>processing.</b> An overview of the fundamentals of fuzzy sets is used to illustrate its use in GIS. The use of some terms within both the GIS and <b>fuzzy</b> <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> community is clarified. Since one of the key problems when applying fuzzy sets to GIS problems is in the specification of grades of membership, the many methods used to specify memberships in fuzzy sets in GIS applications are presented. The α-cut is defined and shown to be of increasing importance in GIS. Non-compensatory and compensatory connectives are compared. Aggregation operators are reviewed and shown to be useful in a number of GIS studies. Fuzzy relations and fuzzy control systems are briefly discussed with reference to their use in GIS and in relation to the {{development of}} modern soft computing technology. Several features of fuzzy sets make that paradigm attractive for use in GIS.
