5|$|Zion National Park {{includes}} an elevated plateau {{that consists of}} sedimentary formations that dip very gently to the east. This means that the oldest strata are exposed along the Virgin River in the Zion Canyon part of the park, and the youngest are exposed in the Kolob Canyons section. The plateau is bounded on the east by the Sevier <b>Fault</b> <b>Zone,</b> and on the west by the Hurricane <b>Fault</b> <b>Zone.</b> Weathering and erosion along north-trending faults and fractures influence the formation of landscape features, such as canyons, in this region.|$|E
5|$|A major {{geological}} {{structure in}} the region is the Northern Patagonian Batholith.

40|$|International audienceWhile {{groundwater}} {{constitutes a}} crucial resource in many crystalline-rock regions worldwide, well-yield conditions are highly variable and barely understood. Nevertheless, {{it is well}} known that <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> may have the capacity to ensure sustainable yield in crystalline media, but there are only a few and disparate examples in the literature that describe high-yield conditions related to <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> in crystalline rock basements. By investigating structural and hydraulic properties of remarkable yielding sites identified in the Armorican Massif, western France, this study discusses the main factors that may explain such exceptional hydrogeological properties. Twenty-three sites, identified through analysis of databases available for the region, are investigated. Results show that: (1) the highly transmissive fractures are related to <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> which ensure the main water inflow in the pumped wells; (2) the probability of intersecting such transmissive <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> does not vary significantly with depth, at least within the range investigated in this study (0 – 200 m); and (3) high yield is mainly controlled by the structural features of the <b>fault</b> <b>zones,</b> in particular the fault dip and the presence of a connected storage reservoir. Conceptual models that summarize the hydrological properties of high-yield groundwater resources related to <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> in crystalline basement are shown and discussed...|$|R

5|$|Manhattan is {{near the}} Nemaha Ridge, a long {{structure}} that is bounded by several faults. The nearby Humboldt <b>Fault</b> <b>Zone</b> in particular {{poses a threat to}} the city; though Kansas is not known for earthquake activity, an earthquake could occur at any time.|$|E
5|$|A steepening of the {{subduction}} zone during the Late Miocene {{has been linked}} to an increase in volcanic activity and its westward migration, but {{it is unlikely that the}} pattern of activity in the southern Puna next to the Toro <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> can be explained through this alone. A large low velocity and low seismic attenuation anomaly is found between 20 and 24° latitude south. Some geologic evidence, including geochemistry and geographic indicators, imply that lithospheric detachment did occur beneath the southern Puna.|$|E
5|$|Burns is {{in southeastern}} Oregon near the {{northern}} edge of the arid Harney Basin. The basin is part of the High Lava Plains, a region dominated by erupting volcanoes in the late Miocene, five to ten million years ago. Centered on the Brothers <b>Fault</b> <b>Zone,</b> which runs southeast–northwest between Steens Mountain and Bend, the High Lava Plains merge with the Blue Mountains to the north and the Basin and Range Province to the south.|$|E
30|$|In the {{simulation}} of uniaxial compressive tests, several <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> approximately {{perpendicular to the}} loading boundaries were formed {{and some of them}} would become the main <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> which eventually ran through the specimen (see Fig. 10 g, h as well as Fig. 12 d, h).|$|R

5|$|East–west-directed {{compression}} from subduction off {{the west}} coast affected the area in later Mesozoic and early Tertiary time by folding and thrust faulting strata. Evidence for the Sevier Orogeny part of this period {{can be seen in}} the Taylor Creek area in the Kolob section of the park. Chunks of Moenave strata have been compressed to the point of thrusting themselves over the same formation in the Taylor Creek Thrust <b>Fault</b> <b>Zone,</b> located on the east flank of the Kanarra anticline.|$|E
5|$|With the San Jacinto <b>Fault</b> <b>Zone</b> to the northwest, the Elsinore fault to the south-southwest, and the Imperial fault {{centered}} {{directly under}} the Imperial Valley, the area frequently encounters seismic activity, including moderate and damaging earthquakes. Other events in 1852, 1892, 1915, 1940, 1942, and 1987 have impacted the region. More small to moderate events of less than 6.0 (local magnitude) have occurred in this area than any other section of the San Andreas fault system.|$|E
5|$|Within the region, {{millions}} {{felt the}} rupture. Reactions to the earthquake varied: some people near the epicenter did not {{react to the}} shaking, while others panicked. A future earthquake {{in the region is}} extremely likely; in 2005, seismologists and geologists estimated a 90% chance of a magnitude 6–7 tremor before 2055, likely originating in the Wabash Valley seismic zone on the Illinois–Indiana border or the New Madrid <b>fault</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E

40|$|Bayat is any one {{location}} in Java Island which located at Central Java that found Pre-Tertiary rocks exposures. Many rocks are jointed caused by tectonic activity, so many geological structure {{can be found}} on this location. In the fact, {{it is very hard to}} find that geological structure, especially fault, and many explanation about it are general. It need detailed explanation and analysis, so <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> and the forming mechanism are known. <b>Fault</b> <b>zones</b> and its characteristics in West Jiwo Hills, Kecamatan Bayat, Kabupaten Klaten, Jawa Tengah, are this research objects. This research is consist of taking for certain <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> and its characteristics based on field observation and fault analysis with stereographic projection using joint data in research location, and also to take for certain the forming mechanism of <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> to know its tectonic setting. The research method of this research is consist of survey method and descriptive method. The analysis method of this research is consist of topographic analysis, petrographic analysis, stereographic projection, and deciding the relatively chronostratigraphic. The stereographic projection is using field joint data that connected with <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> characteristic, and also using Dips software. Based on its result, the interpretation about the forming mechanism of <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> in research location can be known. The geomorphology of research location is consist of two landform units, Structural-Steep Hills Landform Unit and Denudational-Wavy Plain Landform Unit. The stratigraphy of research location, older to younger, consist of Metamorphic Rocks Unit, Sandstone Unit, Eocene Limestone Unit, Igneous Rocks Intrusion Unit, Miocene Limestone Unit, and Alluvial Unit. The geological structure zone of research location is <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> which consist of two types of fault, dextral fault consist of Sesar Mendatar Tugu, Sesar Mendatar Sari and Sesar Mendatar Kebo, and detachment fault consist of Jowo Detachment <b>Fault.</b> Its <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> has two major orientations, southwest-northeast (N 217 o E) and northwest-southeast (N 330 o E, N 122 o E, dan N 287 o E). The <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> forming mechanism in research location occurred on two tectonic periods, on Last Cretaceous caused by southwest-northeast subduction that forming Sesar Mendatar Tugu and Sesar Mendatar Kebo, and on Last Eocene-Oligocene caused by north-south subduction that forming Sesar Mendatar Sari and Jowo Detachment Fault. ...|$|R

5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the Bjorøy Tunnel, the geology of the area was thought to consist entirely of metamorphic basement rocks similar to those exposed on the surrounding islands. The Jurassic sediments encountered in the tunnel included breccia and conglomerate in contact with the underlying gneisses and a sandstone with coal fragments, some of which was quite unconsolidated. Spore and pollen samples gave an Oxfordian age (Late Jurassic) for the sequence. The sedimentary rocks appear to have been deposited into an eroded depression caused by a <b>fault</b> <b>zone,</b> which later reactivated, disrupting the bedding and causing steep dips.|$|E
5|$|Further south, near Mount St. Helens, is {{a similar}} situation, where the St. Helens <b>Fault</b> <b>Zone</b> (SHZ) is {{believed}} to be the eastern edge of the Crescent Formation, but the pre-Cenozoic continental basement is near Mount Rainier. Separating these is the marine sedimentary formation known as the Southern Washington Cascades Conductor (SWCC); it is possible that it was deposited over a fragment of Siletzia. Or not: the oldest parts of the SWCC likely predate Siletzia, and the nature and location of the contact between these two formations is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Tensional forces {{forming the}} Basin and Range physiogeographic {{province}} {{to the west}} about 20 to 25million years ago in Tertiary time created the two faults that bound the Markagunt Plateau (which underlies the park): the Sevier Fault on {{the east and the}} Hurricane Fault on the west. The Hurricane <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> is a major, active, steeply west-dipping normal fault that stretches at least 155miles (250km) from south of the Grand Canyon northward to Cedar City, Utah. Along the southern boundary of the park, tectonic displacement along this fault is about 3,600ft (1,098m). Several other normal faults also developed on the plateau.|$|E
40|$|Normal <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> {{affecting}} the pre-rift limestones in the Corinth rift comprise breccia layers separated by slip surfaces, but also numerous stylolites and calcite veins attesting {{the importance of}} aseismic fluid-driven mass transfer in fault activity. Cathodoluminescence microscopy shows that external (meteoric?) water circulated in the <b>fault</b> <b>zones,</b> whereas mass transfer in the surrounding rocks implied a closed system with water chemically equilibrated with the host-limestone. From these observations, we propose preliminary models of structural development and fluid flow in active <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> in superficial conditions, with a tendency to concentration of deformation and fluid flow related to fault tip propagation...|$|R
30|$|The {{structure}} {{and development of}} <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> {{are closely related to}} the evolution of earthquake ruptures. Although <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> occupy a small volume of the crust, they strongly affect crustal dynamic processes such as earthquakes and fluid flow in the crust (e.g., Faulkner et al. 2010). <b>Fault</b> <b>zones</b> consist of a core, in which strain is high and localized, surrounded by a highly fractured region called the damage zone (e.g., Chester and Logan 1986; Chester et al. 1993). Damage zones also influence fluid flow properties and the frictional strength of faults through their effects on pore pressure (Caine et al. 1996).|$|R
30|$|The {{structure}} of <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> {{has been studied}} in field surveys of exhumed <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> (Faulkner et al. 2003; Shigematsu et al. 2009). High-resolution earthquake locations determined in a field survey have shown a close relationship between seismicity and fault plane features (Valoroso et al. 2014), and high-resolution hypocenter determinations of natural seismicity have shown that active <b>fault</b> <b>zones</b> are narrow features (Hauksson 2010; Powers and Jordan 2010). Valoroso et al. (2014) speculated that coseismic deformation is concentrated along the main fault plane and {{is responsible for producing}} the observed damage zone structure. The loading experiment in this study corroborates these earlier observations.|$|R
5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was recorded}} on Gray-Milne-Ewing seismographs at weather observation stations at Gifu, Nagoya, Osaka, and Tokyo {{as well as}} a station housed at the Imperial University of Tokyo. Although the units went off scale after 8.5 seconds at Gifu and 13.5 seconds at Nagoya (probably due to an inundation of large S-waves) the seismograms they produced have been beneficial for seismologists to develop an understanding of the fault rupture process. The records from the stations at Gifu and Nagoya were especially useful as they were the closest to the <b>fault</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
5|$|The earthquake's {{epicenter}} lay near Manhattan, Kansas, a town {{just off}} the connection of the Kansas River and the Big Blue River. Nearby is the anticline Nemaha Ridge, which {{has been associated with}} at least a few earthquakes of Kansas. A 300‑million-year-old Precambrian granite range bounded by faults, it hosts the Humboldt <b>Fault</b> <b>Zone,</b> which, in addition to serving as the range's easternmost boundary, has produced {{a large portion of the}} state's earthquakes. Each year, it is responsible for at least several small tremors less than magnitude 2.7. It cuts through Permian rock, and according to the Geological Society of America, may actually be a complex fault. Previously, it was believed to be a simple, Precambrian structure.|$|E
5|$|Following the event, a {{field survey}} was {{conducted}} along the <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> {{with the goal of}} estimating the peak ground acceleration of the shock based on visually evaluating precarious rock formations and other indicators. Ground disturbances that were created by the earthquakes were also surveyed, both in the valley and in the foothills, with both vertical and horizontal displacements present in the epicentral area. The strong motion records that were acquired from the event were significant, and a reconnaissance report was recognized for its coverage of the event, and how it set a standard for those types of engineering or scientific papers. Repercussions of the sequence of earthquakes were still being felt in the heavily damaged downtown area of Bakersfield well into the 1990s as city leaders attempted to improve safety of the surviving unreinforced masonry buildings.|$|E

5|$|From {{its origin}} to Birdwood the river follows rolling, {{relatively}} level country before entering a hilly section {{that continues to}} Gumeracha. The river then follows sedimentary rock strata before entering a gorge after Cudlee Creek. It flows through the gorge to Athelstone, passing over the Eden <b>Fault</b> <b>Zone</b> of the Adelaide Hills face and associated escarpment. After the scarp it flows over sedimentary rocks of varying resistance to erosion, {{which has led to}} interspersed narrows and broad basins. From the base of the Adelaide Hills to Adelaide's central business district it runs in a shallow valley with a terraced floor, then down the slope of its own alluvial fan. The structure of this fan shows that the river formerly entered Gulf St Vincent via the Port River. Over time the Torrens deposited sediment, choking its own outflow; becoming locked behind coastal sand dunes and forming the swampy areas of the Cowandilla Plains and the reedbeds.|$|E
5|$|The dam {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the 1950s; construction work commenced in 1968, involving the diversion of the North Fork American River through a tunnel {{and the construction of}} a massive earthen cofferdam. Following a nearby earthquake and the discovery of a seismic fault that underlay the dam site, work on the project was halted for fears that the dam's design would not allow it to survive a major quake on the same <b>fault</b> <b>zone.</b> Although the dam was redesigned and a new proposal submitted by 1980, spiraling costs and limited economic justification {{put an end to the}} project until severe flooding in 1986 briefly renewed interest in Auburn's flood control potential.

5|$|The oldest {{activity}} is an ignimbrite erupted 0.65 ± 0.18 mya, called the Tuzgle ignimbrite. On {{the rim of}} the caldera left by this eruption is a lava dome complex named the Old Complex Unit. 0.3 ± 0.1 mya ago effusive activity commenced with the Pre-platform and Platform units that were then followed by a tectonic event that dissected these units. Afterwards, the Post-platform and Young Flow Units were erupted. The youngest unit is latitic and was dated 0.1 ± (0.1-0.3) mya ago. This unit may be Holocene or PleistoceneHolocene in age. It is possible that the continuing activity of the Chorrillos <b>fault</b> <b>zone</b> is compressing the magma chamber and feeder dyke of Tuzgle, thus impeding eruptive activity. The well-preserved summit crater and youthful-looking lava flows have been assigned Holocene ages.|$|E
