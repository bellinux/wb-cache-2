In this study, this problem was addressed by attenuating amphiphile charge density within a cholate micelle environment. The amphiphile consisted of a cationic peptide, acetyl-CWKKKPKK-amide, conjugated to dilaurylphosphatidylethanolamine. In the presence <b>of</b> cholate, multiple <b>equivalents</b> <b>of</b> cationic <b>charge</b> were required {{to bring about the}} completion of DNA condensation.

Aggregation, as measured by static light scattering at 90 ° and by turbidity, was not observed until further additions of peptide–lipid conjugate were made beyond the end point of DNA condensation. Liposome complexes containing the non-aggregated, compacted DNA were formed by adding dioleoylphosphatidylcholine followed by removing the cholate by dialysis.
