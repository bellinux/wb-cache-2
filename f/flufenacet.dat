40|$|Inhibitors of {{very long}} chain fatty acid {{synthesis}} (VLCFAs, HRAC group K 3) including flufenacet-based products are key herbicides in weed management strategies in particular of Western European cereal growing areas.

In comparison, herbicide resistance to VLCFAs inhibitors develops considerably slower. Yet, resistance to the ‘low-risk’ herbicide <b>flufenacet</b> was documented in multi-resistant ryegrass (Lolium spp.) in the northwestern United States.

S. A., including the soft white winter wheat producing regions of the Pacific Northwest. Pyroxasulfone is a soil-applied herbicide with the potential to control broadleaf and grass weed species, including grass weed biotypes resistant to Group 1, 2 and 7 herbicides, in several crops for which registration has been completed or is pending including wheat, corn, sunflower, dry beans and soybeans. Field experiments were conducted during 2006 - 2009 near Corvallis, OR, to evaluate the potential for Italian ryegrass control in winter wheat with applications of pyroxasulfone. Application rates of PRE treatments ranged from 0. 05 - 0. 15 kg ai ha⁻¹. All treatments were compared to standard Italian ryegrass soil-applied herbicides used in winter wheat including diuron, <b>flufenacet,</b> and <b>flufenacet</b> + metribuzin. Visual evaluations of Italian ryegrass and ivyleaf speedwell control and winter wheat injury were made at regular intervals following applications. Winter wheat yields were quantified at grain maturity. Ivyleaf speedwell control was variable and Italian ryegrass control following pyroxasulfone applications ranged from 65 to 100 % and was equal to control achieved with <b>flufenacet</b> and <b>flufenacet</b> + metribuzin treatments and greater than that achieved with diuron applications. Winter wheat injury from pyroxasulfone ranged 0 to 8 % and was most associated with the 0. 15 kg ha⁻¹ application rate. However, this early-season injury did not negatively impact winter wheat yield. Pyroxasulfone applied at the application rates and timings in these studies resulted in high levels of activity on Italian ryegrass and excellent winter wheat safety. Based on the results, pyroxasulfone {{has the potential to be}} used as a soil-applied herbicide in winter wheat for Italian ryegrass management and its utility for management of other important grass and broadleaf weeds of cereal-based cropping systems should be evaluated...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, an {{increasing}} occurrence {{of resistance to}} Apera spica-venti, especially to ALS inhibitors and partially to ACCase inhibitors has been reported for the new federal states, too. The dominance of winter wheat and winter rape in crop rotations associated with a unilateral application of herbicides has increased the selection pressure. In order to counter further spread of herbicide resistance, the right choice of the mode of action of the herbicide or herbicide combination and highly efficacious herbicide treatments are the methods of choice, of course {{in addition to the}} agronomic aspects, such as sowing date and crop rotation. The research determined how and to what extent dicotyledonous weeds are associated with loose silkybentgrass. Based on the results, single herbicides or herbicide tank mixes were tested to achieve the expected level of control. As a result, treatments which have achieved very high level of control against A. spica-venti and the most common dicotyledonous weeds can be recommended. A total of 191 trial sites have been included in the analysis of A. spica-venti. Using the HRAC-classification of herbicides used, groups were formed which might contribute to solving problems specifically linked to the detected resistance situation of the site. In the autumn, flufenacet-containing herbicides, such as Malibu (<b>flufenacet,</b> pendimethalin), Herold SC (<b>flufenacet,</b> diflufenican), Bacara Forte (<b>flufenacet,</b> flurtamone, diflufenican), Carmina 640 (chlortoluron, diflufenican) and Fenikan (isoproturon, diflufenican) demonstrated high efficiency against A. spica-venti. Combinations of herbicides with the HRAC classification of N and E provide further opportunities for the implementation of anti-resistance management strategies, such as Sumimax + Ciral (flumioxazin + metsulfuron, flupyrsulfuron) or Boxer (prosulfocarb) + Diflanil 500 SC (diflufenican) or Beflex (beflubutamid).

The purpose {{of this research was}} to screen selected putative resistant populations of Italian ryegrass for resistance to the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) -inhibiting herbicides diclofop and pinoxaden and the acetolactate synthase (ALS) -inhibiting herbicides imazamox, pyroxsulam, and mesosulfuron in the greenhouse and to use field experiments to develop herbicide programs for Italian ryegrass control. Resistance to diclofop was confirmed in eight populations from Tennessee. These eight populations did not show cross-resistance to pinoxaden. One additional population (R 1) from Union County, North Carolina, was found to be resistant to both diclofop and pinoxaden. The level of resistance to pinoxaden of the R 1 population was 15 times that of the susceptible population. No resistance was confirmed to any of the ALS-inhibiting herbicides examined in this research. Field experiments demonstrated PRE Italian ryegrass control with chlorsulfuron (71 to 94 %) and <b>flufenacet</b> + metribuzin (84 to 96 %).

In the herbicide experiments two treatments were applied by PRE emergence herbicides (metribuzin, clomazone, dimethenamid and metribuzin, <b>flufenacet,</b> clomazone) and another two treatments were sprayed {{with a combination of}} PRE + POST emergence herbicides (metribuzin, <b>flufenacet,</b> thifensulfuron and pendimethalin, thifensulfuron, bentazone, cycloxydim). Furthermore, a POST herbicide treatment was implemented (thifensulfuron, bentazone, thifensulfuron and fluazifop-P-butyl). In the mechanical weed control experiments, treatments were: three times hoeing, PRE emergence harrowing plus three times hoeing, hoeing and harrowing in rotation or three times harrowing. In both experiments an untreated control was included. A 90 % weed control efficacy and 23 % yield increase was observed in the POST herbicide treatment. PRE + POST treatments resulted in 92 % to 99 % weed control efficiency and 15 % yield increase compared to the untreated control. In the mechanical weed control experiments the combination of PRE emergence harrowing and POST emergence hoeing resulted in 82 % weed control efficiency and 34 % higher yield compared to the untreated control.

In Oregon, the number of populations with multiple-resistance continues to increase. To manage these resistant populations, the resistance patterns must be determined. In this study, five Italian ryegrass populations (CT, R 1, R 2, R 3 and R 4) from two cropping systems were studied for resistance patterns and mechanisms. The CT population is from a Christmas tree plantation and was resistant to at least six herbicides with four different mechanisms of action: atrazine, diuron (2. 4 -fold), glyphosate (7. 4 -fold), hexazinone (3. 1 -fold), imazapyr (1. 8 -fold), and sulfometuron. The resistant indices (RI) for sulfometuron and atrazine could not be calculated because 50 % growth reduction for the CT population was not reached even with the highest rates applied, 17. 6 kg ai ha⁻¹and 16 kg ai ha⁻¹, respectively, which are 16 times the recommended field application rates for this two herbicides. The CT population accumulated less shikimate than the S population. There were two mutations in the CT population, Trp 591 to Leu in the ALS gene and Ser 264 to Gly in the psbA gene, which explain the ALS and PII cross resistance, respectively. R 1, R 2, R 3 and R 4 were collected from annual cropping systems. All four populations were resistant to <b>flufenacet.</b> RIs for two populations, R 2 and R 4, were 8. 4 and 5. 9, respectively. R 2 and R 4 also were resistant to mesosulfuron-methyl, pinoxaden, quizalofop and clethodim. R 4 was resistant to diuron, but R 2 was not.

40|$|International audienceAcyl {{chain length}} {{is thought to}} be crucial for biophysical {{properties}} of the membrane, in particular during cell division, when active vesicular fusion is necessary. In higher plants, the process of cytokinesis is unique, because the separation of the two daughter cells is carried out by de novo vesicular fusion to generate a laterally expanding cell plate. In Arabidopsis thaliana, very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) depletion caused by a mutation in the microsomal elongase gene PASTICCINO 2 (PAS 2) or by application of the selective elongase inhibitor <b>flufenacet</b> altered cytokinesis. Cell plate expansion was delayed and the formation of the endomembrane tubular network altered. These defects were associated with specific aggregation of the cell plate markers YFP-Rab-A 2 a and KNOLLE during cytokinesis. Changes in levels of VLCFA also resulted in modification of endocytosis and sensitivity to brefeldin A. Finally, the cytokinesis impairment in pas 2 cells was associated with reduced levels of very long fatty acyl chains in phospholipids.

40|$|BACKGROUND The {{efficacy}} of pre-emergence herbicides within fields is spatially variable due to soil heterogeneity. We quantified {{the effect of}} soil organic matter on the {{efficacy of}} two pre-emergence herbicides; <b>flufenacet</b> and pendimethalin, against A. myosuroides and investigated the implications of variation in organic matter for weed management using a crop-weed competition model. RESULTS Soil organic matter {{played a critical role}} in determining the level of control achieved. The high organic matter soil had more surviving weeds with higher biomass than the low organic matter soil. In the absence of competition, surviving plants recovered to produce the same amount of seed as if no herbicide were applied. The competition model predicted that weeds surviving pre-emergence herbicides could compensate for sub-lethal effects even when competing with the crop. The ED 50 was higher for weed seed production than seedling mortality or biomass. This difference was greatest on high organic matter soil. CONCLUSION These results show that the application rate of herbicides should be adjusted to account for within-field variation in soil organic matter. The results from the modelling emphasised the importance of crop competition in limiting the capacity of weeds surviving pre-emergence herbicides to compensate and replenish the seedbank...|$|E
40|$|Emiliania huxleyi {{and some}} related prymnesiophyte algae produce a novel group of {{polyunsaturated}} long-chain C 37 - 39 alkenones, alkenoates, and alkenes as their major neutral lipids, however their biosynthesis pathway is unknown. Like triglycerides, these lipids {{are believed to}} be utilized as storage lipids and are accumulated in lipid bodies {{to be used as a}} fuel source, presumably. Also C 31 - 33 cis-alkenes have been identified in E. huxleyi but {{are believed to be}} different in synthesis and function. By studying the synthesis of these lipids I set out to discern how these two types of neutral lipids are formed in E. huxleyi. I used a combination of techniques, including GC-MS analysis, radiolabeling, and inhibitors, to examine lipid pools during growth cycles, bicarbonate dosing, and light-dark manipulations. By using GC-MS analysis I identified the presence of C 31 - 33 cis-alkenes exclusively in E. huxleyi strains CCMP 1516 and 371, and Isochrysis galbania strain CCMP 1323; where E. huxleyi strains CCMP 1742, 3266, and 3268 had both cis-alkenes and C 37 - 38 trans-alkenes. I also found accumulation of both cis-alkenes and C 37 - 38 trans-alkenes in light to dark manipulations was similar to that seen in storage lipids, suggesting that the long chain cis-alkenes are in fact another storage lipid and may share a similar synthesis pathway to the trans-alkenes. Using radiolabeling studies I found external acetate is not acquired under light dependent mechanisms and is utilized primarily in production of polar lipids; while external bicarbonate acquisition and use in lipid synthesis is light-dependent, and as a cellular building block it is distributed more evenly amongst lipid pools. Also, flow of carbon into CCMP 1516 and 3268 cells from external bicarbonate into lipid pools is inhibited by cerulenin (fatty acid synthase inhibitor), <b>flufenacet</b> (elongase inhibitor), and quizaloflop (acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor). Platensimycin (fatty acid synthase II inhibitor) only affects flow of bicarbonate into CCMP 1516 C 31 - 33 cis-alkenes. Finally, flow of carbon into CCMP 1516 cells from external acetate into lipid pools is inhibited by cerulenin. <b>Flufenacet</b> and quizaloflop only affects flow of acetate into C 37 - 39 trans-alkenes. Platensimycin has no effect on the flow of acetate into lipid pools in CCMP 1516.

40|$|Although {{cytokinesis}} {{is vital}} for plant growth and development, our mechanistic understanding of the highly regulated membrane and cargo transport mechanisms in relation to polysaccharide deposition during this process is limited. Here, we present an in-depth characterization of the small molecule endosidin 7 (ES 7) inhibiting callose synthase activity and arresting late cytokinesis both in vitro and in vivo in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). ES 7 is a specific inhibitor for plant callose deposition during cytokinesis that does not affect endomembrane trafficking during interphase or cytoskeletal organization. The specificity of ES 7 was demonstrated (1) by comparing its action with that of known inhibitors such as caffeine, <b>flufenacet,</b> and concanamycin A and (2) across kingdoms with a comparison in yeast. The interplay between cell plate-specific post-Golgi vesicle traffic and callose accumulation was analyzed using ES 7, and it revealed unique and temporal contributions of secretory and endosomal vesicles in cell plate maturation. While RABA 2 A-labeled vesicles, which accumulate at the early stage of cell plate formation, were not affected by ES 7, KNOLLE was differentially altered by the small molecule. In addition, the presence of clathrin-coated vesicles in cells containing elevated levels of callose and their reduction under ES 7 treatment further support the role of endocytic membrane remodeling in the maturing cell plate while the plate is stabilized by callose. Taken together, these data show the essential role of callose during the late stages of cell plate maturation and establish the temporal relationship between vesicles and regulatory proteins at the cell plate assembly matrix during polysaccharide deposition.

The calculated resistance factors for the herbicides varied between biotypes and occurring resistance mechanisms. Independent of the range of the resistance factors, low levels already caused decreased effectiveness under real field conditions. Despite confirmed target-site and enhanced metabolic resistances, most of the tested herbicide mixtures and sequence applications provided useful efficacy levels. Soil-acting herbicides have become the backbone for controlling heavy infestations of black-grass populations in practice. Especially <b>flufenacet</b> and its mixtures provide high efficacy levels for the reduction of the first grass weed flush. Within the herbicide strategy study, Atlantis WG® appeared as the most effective post emergence applied product, especially on biotypes with metabolic resistances. With regard to missing alternative solutions in the near future, a mid to long-term sustainable crop-production can only be assured with mixtures and sequence applications of different herbicides and modes of action combined with integrated weed management tools...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{the results of}} over fifteen years of {{experimentation}} are summarized, concerning the possibility of use of herbicides included in several chemical classes and with various mechanisms of action on poplar clones of different species, European and North American. The active ingredients were tested mainly singly or in commercial mixtures as well, applied before emergence (interpreted here as sprout of poplar cuttings not yet occurred and before weed infestation) or after emergence (interpreted here as cuttings with sprouts 20 - 25 cm long and after weed colonisation). Almost 50 % of the 43 tested formulations {{has proved to be}} unserviceable in poplar nursery because of the hard damage induced on plantlets, i. e. dicotyledonicides and those with a wide action range, especially applied after emergence. It was the case of acetolactate synthase inhibitors and synthetic auxins. About 25 % of formulations has proved to be utilizable with limited risks and 20 % without risk. After emergence, the lowest damage was caused by graminicide compounds included in the class of acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors (e. g. diclofop-methyl, cycloxydim); before emergence, very good applicative opportunities were showed by microtubule assembly inhibitors, especially propyzamide, and the cellulose synthesis inhibitor isoxaben. Among the herbicides utilizable with some risk after emergence, the photosynthesis inhibitors pyridate and phenmedipham (singly or in mixture) were interesting since they are the only ones that allow the control of broad-leaved weeds in the presence of herbaceous poplar shoots. Before emergence, <b>flufenacet</b> and isoxaflutole were remarkable as well, the latter being active versus hardly limited weeds. In summary, besides the two aforesaid compounds, the graminicide cycloxydim and - more cautiously - clodinafop and propaquizafop may be hopefully introduced in poplar nurseries after emergence, in association with the wide action range mixture of phenmedipham, desmedipham and ethofumesate...|$|E
40|$|In autumn 2009 and 2010, {{black-grass}} {{samples from}} different regions in Germany were sown {{into a field}} near Münster. The sandy soil of the field was free of black-grass seeds until the sowing date. The aim of the trial was to compare the fitness and resistance value of different black-grass populations under outdoor conditions. Particularly the impact of pre-emergence herbicides was of interest. Different efficiency factors of CADOU SC® (<b>flufenacet)</b> against the tested black-grass populations were observed. The disparities {{in the level of}} control were even greater under the use of STOMP AQUA® (pendimethalin), BOXER® (prosulfocarb) and ARELON TOP® (isoproturon). A hundred percent control of all black-grass populations in both seasons was only achieved by the use of KERB FLO® (propyzamide). It was visible that the black-grass populations that were difficult to control had a powerful constitution, even better than that of those populations {{that turned out to be}} highly susceptible to the herbicide treatments. The fall results in both seasons of the experiment (2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011) were consistent. This was also confirmed for the efficacy results for foliar herbicides in spring. Subject to field history, there was a wide range in sensitivity to the tested herbicides. Black-grass populations from coastal regions were poorly controlled by FOCUS ULTRA® (cycloxydim) or SELECT 240 EC® (clethodim) + PARA SOMMER® (paraffin oil), but were highly susceptible to MOTIVELL® (nicosulfuron). Contrary results were observed with reference to the blackgrass populations from the inland. These populations were derived from fields where the crop rotation contains of 66 % cereals and 33 % maize. The populations from the coast were sampled in crop rotations dominated by cereals or cereals followed by oil seed rape. Poor efficacy of ATLANTIS OD® (mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron) was observed in black-grass populations from the coastal regions as well as from the inland...|$|E
40|$|The term ‘emerging contaminants’ is {{generally}} {{used to refer}} to compounds previously not considered or known to be significant to groundwater (in terms of distribution and/or concentration) which are now being more widely detected. As analytical techniques improve, previously undetected organic micropollutants are being observed in the aqueous environment. Many emerging contaminants remain unregulated, but the number of regulated contaminants will continue to grow slowly over the next several decades. There is a wide variety of sources and pathways for these compounds to enter the environment and these include agriculture and urban areas. Some of these contaminants can have human or ecological health effects and {{there is a need for}} better understanding of their fate in environmental systems. This report provides a short review of the types of organic micropollutants which can be found in the aqueous environment. These include nanomaterials, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, industrial additives and by-products, personal care products and fragrances, water treatment by-products, flame/fire retardants and surfactants, as well as caffeine and nicotine metabolites and hormones. Many of the compounds are relatively small polar molecules which are not effectively removed by conventional drinking water treatment using activated carbon. Pesticides and some industrial compounds are presently covered by the Water Framework Directive, the Groundwater Regulations and the Drinking Water Directive. Additional parameters, such as bisphenol A and nonyl-phenol are anticipated to be covered by revisions to the Drinking Water Directive. Others are currently unregulated. In order to assess the hazards presented by such compounds, information on usage, persistence, leachability and a robust sensitive analytical method is required. The UK metaldehyde problem was not originally discovered due to lack of an analytical method and was exacerbated by recalcitrance in water treatment. For many pesticides these requirements are fulfilled and an assessment of risk of leaching to groundwater can be made. However, for pesticide metabolites this information can be sparse and for compounds such as pharmaceuticals it can be lacking. A simple hazard assessment for currently approved pesticides was made from information on UK usage, persistence, sorption to soil carbon and published leaching indices. The following compounds were assessed as having the greatest potential for leaching to water: 2, 4 -D, amidosulfuron, bentazone, clopyralid, dicamba, florasulam, fosthiazate, imazaquin, iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, maleic hydrazide, MCPA, MCPP-P, metribuzin, metsulfuronmethyl, quinmerac, oxamyl, and triclopyr with a further 46 also having potential. Of these, 19 had an octanol/water partition coefficient (Kow) less than that of metaldehyde and therefore are likely to be incompletely removed by water treatment. A simple assessment for pesticide metabolites, based only on organic carbon/water partition coefficient (Koc) and persistence data, in this study gave results which agreed in principle with other studies. The different approaches indicate that the metabolites of chlorothalonil, cyanazine, diflufenican, <b>flufenacet,</b> iodosulfuron-methyl, metaldehyde, metazachlor and metsulfuron-methyl are likely to pose the greatest risk to drinking water. In many cases these metabolites are derived from parents which have a lesser risk. Other organic micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, cannot as yet be assessed in the same way due to a lack of persistence data since the majority of persistence studies have been directed at water treatment. A range of organic micropollutants from urban settings have been detected in ground and surface water. Commonly detected compounds include: bisphenol A, carbamazepine, galaxolide, ibuprofen, iopamidol, phthalates, phenyl ethoxylates, and sulfamethoxazole. Case studies show that a small number of contaminants may be used to characterise the contaminant loading and also be used to assess the migration pathways in urban areas. Data interpreted by BGS from the Environment Agency’s monitoring programme for organic pollutants indicates that the 30 most frequently detected compounds comprise both established and emerging compounds and include a number of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, petroleum compounds, triazine herbicides, chlorinated solvents, degradation products and THMs, caffeine, DEET and industrial compounds such as bisphenol A and tributyl phosphate. Specific determinands include a range of currently licensed and phased out pesticides with a few metabolites, pharmaceuticals including carbamazepine and triclosan, caffeine, nicotine and food additives and alkyl phosphates. These data exhibit hot spots which may indicate possible research areas. Future research should focus on a compound identified in the literature and detected by Environment Agency monitoring. Possible topics could be a study of migration through the unsaturated zone. In many cases the mechanism for migration of emerging contaminants from the surface to groundwater is very unclear...|$|E
40|$|Maize {{damage has}} been {{observed}} {{from time to time}} in many parts of South Africa where registered herbicides were applied. Differential cultivar tolerance to certain herbicides was identified as an important factor in many cases where herbicide selectivity was inadequate. A study was done to investigate the existence of differential tolerance of maize genotypes to selected herbicides. Several maize genotypes were screened for tolerance to selected herbicides, both in the greenhouse and in the field. Maize genotypes demonstrated significant differences in their tolerance to all herbicides. Some genotypes were severely injured by certain herbicides while others were not affected at all by the same herbicide. This suggests that maize genotypes should be screened for tolerance to herbicides in order to reduce crop injury by using only appropriate ones for specific genotypes. Generally, hybrids were more tolerant to herbicides than inbreds, indicating that screening may be most necessary in seed production, where inbreds are used, than in commercial production where only hybrids are used. Tolerance of maize to herbicides was more variable to metazachlor than to other herbicides, and metazachlor also injured more genotypes than other herbicides. This was probably due to differences in herbicide mechanism of action. Shoot or root dry mass reduction of some of the maize genotypes occurred without visual injury symptoms, thus suggesting that visual injury may not reliably indicate susceptibility or tolerance to herbicides. The degree of correspondence of herbicide effects on maize in the greenhouse and the field was determined. Comparison of results from the greenhouse and the field showed that there is positive correlation between herbicide effects in the greenhouse and in the field. There was generally good correspondence of major parameters, such as shoot dry mass and injury symptoms, in the greenhouse and in the field. Similarly these parameters were positively correlated with the grain yield obtained from the field. It appears that shoot dry mass and visual injury symptoms could be good predictors of the yield. This indicates that reliable data could be generated through quicker screening at greenhouse level. A total of four herbicides, metazachlor, dimethenamid, acetochlor and the combination atrazine / metolachlor / terbuthylazine, had significant correlations while only two, <b>flufenacet</b> and acetochlor + atrazine/sulcotrione, had no significant correlations for major parameters with the yield. This indicates that the correlation of data was herbicide-dependent. The influence of temperature on maize tolerance to alachlor, metazachlor and metolachlor was investigated. Results showed that low temperatures reduce the tolerance of maize to these herbicides. This could mean that low temperature may reduce the selectivity of these herbicides. Fluctuating temperature conditions of 10 °C at night and 35 °C during the day, which are found in some maize producing areas, did not affect maize tolerance to the herbicides. The possibility of improving metazachlor tolerance in maize was also investigated. Evidence provided for possible gene effects on the tolerance of metazachlor indicates that maize tolerance to the herbicide could be improved by crossing tolerant parents. The results suggest that it may be possible to improve metazachlor tolerance by crossing appropriate parent lines with dominant genes for tolerance to metazachlor. Ultrastructural changes in the maize seedling root and shoot cells caused by metazachlor were investigated. In susceptible genotypes root cell nucleoli were found to be abnormally large, empty and more abundant than those in untreated control plants. In susceptible plants the chromatids appeared disorganised in cell nucleoli, and both the nuclear and plasma membranes showed signs of disintegrating. There were more and larger vacuoles in the herbicide-susceptible plants. Leaf cells from the susceptible plants had more empty vacuoles and more chloroplasts with generally disorganised content. The bundle sheath chloroplast membranes were dilated in susceptible plants, and the orientation of the grana was disrupted. In the herbicide-tolerant plants, the ultrastructure was not different from that of all the untreated plants. The established differential tolerance of maize to herbicides necessitates the screening of all genotypes to all registered herbicides in order to recommend specific herbicides for certain maize genotypes. Due to the large number of genotypes that would require screening, techniques that yield reliable data quickly have obvious merit. Pot experiments under controlled conditions, which could be selected to promote herbicide bioactivity, are likely to provide data with which the best possible predictions on the risk of herbicide damage in the field could be made. Based on this requirement, environmental factors that should be considered for greenhouse work are: soil with low adsorptive capacity, soil water content close to the field capacity level, and cool temperatures. When screening for herbicide tolerance, the use of herbicide rates in excess of the recommended rate could obviate the need for special environmental conditions, since all the aforementioned factors basically promote the accumulation of higher than usual amounts of herbicide at the site of action in the plant. Therefore, the use of at least a 2 X-herbicide rate in screening experiments is advised. Thesis (PhD (Plant Production: Weed Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.
