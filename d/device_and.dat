OpenHMPP directives describe remote procedure call (RPC) on an accelerator device (e.g. GPU) or more generally a set of cores. The directives annotate C or Fortran codes to describe two sets of functionalities: the offloading of procedures (denoted codelets) onto a remote <b>device</b> <b>and</b> the optimization of data transfers between the CPU main memory and the accelerator memory.|$|E
