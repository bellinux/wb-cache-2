The model accounts for phase and frequency signals and thus reflects both, frequency and phase behavior. The system model is investigated in detail. Each component is <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> its transfer function {{to obtain an}} overall input/output behavior for the frequency and the phase domain. Furthermore, the physical characteristics of the noise sources within the structure are studied and their effects on the phase noise of the PLL are determined. The system level model is independent of the actual implementation, however, the relation to an existing frequency synthesizer for wireless communications is discussed. Simulation results confirm the accurateness of the presented model {{with respect to the}} time and frequency behavior of the system. I...|$|E

It is necessary to make this information available for the selection (or elimination) of available solutions, their orchestration, and their execution. Current standards barely address this class of problems. The approach {{presented in this paper}} is the first step towards self-organizing federation languages. The system interfaces are <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> exchangeable data. The context of information exchange (syntax, semantics, and pragmatics) is captured as metadata. These metadata are used to identify the elements of a formal federation language that links model composability and simulation interoperability based on conceptual model elements. The paper describes the formal process of selection, orchestration, and execution and the underlying mathematics for the information exchange specifications that bridge conceptual and engineering levels of the federation process. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{starting}} point {{of this paper is}} a system <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a UML class diagram where system states are characterized by OCL invariants and system transitions are defined by OCL pre- and postconditions. The aim of our approach is to assist the developer in learning about the consequences of the described system states and transitions and about the formal implications of the properties that are explicitly given. We propose to draw conclusions about the stated constraints by translating the UML and OCL model into the algebraic specification language and system Maude, which is based on rewrite logic. We will concentrate in this paper on employing Maude’s capabilities for state search. Maude’s state search offers the possibility to describe a start configuration of the system and then explore all configurations reachable by rewriting. The search can be adjusted by formulating requirements for the allowed states and the allowed transitions. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hybrid simulator for the fast calculation of x-ray projections. Uncollided radiations are determined with a ray-driven method whereas the scattering signal is partitioned into single and multiple scattering, respectively estimated with an accelerated deterministic method and a coarse Monte Carlo simulation.

The hybrid method has been validated with the Monte Carlo code Geant 4 on aluminium phantoms with varying size and object-to-detector distance. Good agreement has been found between the two methods. The acceleration achieved by the hybrid method on a single projection lies between two to four orders of magnitude. The proposed simulator has been developed for industrial cone-beam CT scanners and the correction of scatter artefacts...|$|E

The library blocks include models for the superconducting cavities, the rf power source, the beam, and the rf feedback system. The rf control relevant electrical and mechanical characteristics of the cavity are <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> timevarying state space models. Included are perturbations from Lorentz force detuning and microphonics with the appropriate parameters for several mechanical resonances. The power source is calibrated in terms of actual power and includes saturation characteristics and noise. An arbitrary time structure can be imposed on the beam current to reflect a macro-pulse structure and bunch charge fluctuations. For rf feedback several schemes can be selected: Generator driven system or self-excited loop, traditional amplitude and phase control or I/Q control. The choices for the feedback controller include analog or digital approaches and various choices of filters for the gain stages. Feed forward can be added to further suppress repetitive errors. The results of a performance analysis of the TTF Linac rf system using these tools are presented. ...|$|E
