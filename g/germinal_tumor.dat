40|$|Facial {{teratoma}} is {{an extremely}} rare <b>germinal</b> <b>tumor</b> in newborn babies. It is often diagnosed antenatally by means of ultrasound and even MRI. The prognosis of this tumor depends mainly on the size {{and the location of}} the lesion (eye, respiratory and digestive tracts). Multidisciplinary examination is needed to ensure the newborn’s survival. Pre-operative conditioning is needed to avoid complications and carcinogenic risks. The aim {{of this article is to}} Specify the anatomical features of facial teratoma and consider the interests of foetopathology review. We report a male baby, prematurely born at 28 WA dead at hour 23. Physical examination reveals a frontal mass on the left side of the face plus a facial dysmorphia. Dissection shows hyperplasia of lungs, hypertrophied liver and a splenomegaly. Histological examination reveals neural tissue associated with areas of cartilage and hair; hence the diagnosis of congenital teratoma of the face. Antenatal diagnosis of congenital teratoma of the face is very crucial allowing a multidisciplinary care involving obstetricians, neonatologists, surgeons and anesthesiologists...|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} risk of thromboembolic events {{is well known in}} patients with cancer. We aimed to highlight this relationship in a case of testicular cancer. A 25 -year-old young man was admitted to our hospital with complaints of sudden onset chest pain and dyspnea.

A partial reduction of breath sounds in the basal posterior of the right lung was present on lung auscultation. Posteroanterior chest radiography was interpreted as normal. Echocardiographic evaluation revealed severe dilatation and hypertrophy of the right heart, and the pulmonary arterial pressure was 75 mmHg. Multi-detector computed tomography showed a submassive pulmonary embolism and inferior vena cava thrombosis. The level of serum alpha-fetoprotein was slightly higher than normal. A right testicular mass was found upon physical examination. A right orchiectomy operation was performed.

40|$|Cancers {{of unknown}} origin {{represent}} approximately 5 % of all cancers {{and are therefore}} as frequent as some solid tumors such as gastric or pancreatic cancers. The diagnosis of cancer of unknown origin {{should be based on}} a detailed pathological examination including immunohistochemical techniques and electron microscopy; hormonal receptors should also be measured. Besides detailed medical history and physical examination, only a few additional tests should be carried out: routine chemistry including the assay of HCG, alphafoetoprotein and specific antigen of the prostate, chest X-ray, thyroid scan, mammography and abdominal CT scan. Other tests are generally not of sufficient specificity and sensitivity. Unknown primary tumors arising in the cervical area are frequently squamous cell carcinomas corresponding to occult primary tumors of the upper aerodigestive mucosae and are efficiently treated by cervicofacial radiotherapy or lymph node dissection. Women presenting with axillary lymph nodes with no obvious primary tumor should be treated according to the guidelines used for breast cancer. The patients with inguinal lymph nodes of unknown origin are usually treated with radiation therapy. The syndrome of <b>germinal</b> <b>tumors</b> of extragonadic origin are usually treated with radiation therapy. The syndrome of <b>germinal</b> <b>tumors</b> of extragonadic origin corresponds to cases of undifferentiated or poorly differentiated carcinomas in patients under 50 years of age and with one of the following characteristics: involvement of the median organs, lung involvement, lymph node involvement or increase of alphafoetoprotein or HCG. The therapeutic approach recommended for these patients consists of the chemotherapeutic combination used for testicular cancer. For all other patients, the prognosis remains poor. Patients with local symptoms may be treated by radiation therapy; others may receive a combination of fluorouracil, doxorubicin and mitomycin. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Testis {{cancer is}} most {{commonly}} discovered because of painless testicular enlargement. Careful examination remains the best non-invasive diagnostic procedure.

40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} {{demonstrates that}} adult tissue contains {{a population of}} very primitive pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Recently, our group identified a population of very small SCs in murine bone marrow (BM) and other adult organs that express several markers characteristic for epiblast/germ line-derived SCs. We named these rare cells “very small embryonic like stem cells (VSELs). ” We hypothesized that these cells, which are deposited during early gastrulation in developing tissues/organs, {{play an important role}} in the turnover of tissue-specific/committed SCs. Based on this, we envision that germ line is not only the origin but also a “basis/skeleton” for the SC compartment in adult life forms. We noticed that VSELs could be mobilized into peripheral blood (PB) and the number of these cells circulating in PB increases during stress and tissue/organ injuries (e. g., heart infarct, stroke). Furthermore, our data indicates that VSELs are protected from uncontrolled proliferation and teratoma formation by a unique pattern of methylation of selected somatic imprinted genes. Finally, we envision that in pathological situations, VSELs could be involved in the development of some malignancies (e. g., teratomas, <b>germinal</b> <b>tumors,</b> pediatric sarcomas) ...|$|R
40|$|Fetal {{intracranial}} {{tumors are}} rare. The diagnosis is generally made on histology after birth. The {{aim of this}} study was to analyze clinical and imaging data in a series of fetal intracranial tumors and emphasize the findings that may help approach the diagnosis antenatally. We retrospectively analyzed imaging and clinical findings in 27 cases of fetal intracranial tumors assessed by ultrasound (27 / 27) and MR imaging (24 / 27). A histological diagnosis was always obtained. Main diagnoses included 15 <b>germinal</b> <b>tumors</b> (13 teratomas), 4 glial tumors, 2 craniopharyngiomas and 3 hamartomas. Average gestational age at diagnosis was 27 weeks for teratomas, 21 weeks for hamartomas and 34 weeks for glial tumors. All tumors but one were supra tentorial, and the lesion extended in the posterior fossa in two teratomas. A heterogeneous pattern, which was more frequently seen in teratomas, was better visualized by MR than US imaging. In addition, in two cases of teratomas, MR imaging better assessed the extension of the tumor. Teratomas and gliomas are the most frequent brain tumors in the fetus.

40|$|Abstract Introduction We {{describe}} {{a case of}} {{non-small cell lung cancer}} that was found to stain positive for beta-human chorionic gonadotropin on immunohistochemistry. Only a few case reports have described lung cancers that secrete beta-human chorionic gonadotropin. Case presentation A 68 -year-old Caucasian man presented with symptoms of weakness, fatigue and weight loss for the past two months. On examination, he was found to have generalized lymphadenopathy, and radiologic workup revealed numerous metastases in the lungs, liver and kidneys. Biopsy of the supraclavicular lymph node revealed metastatic large cell lung cancer with beta-human chorionic gonadotropin hormone positivity. The serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level was 11, 286 mIU/ml (upper limit of normal, 0. 5 mIU/ml in non-pregnant females). He was diagnosed with stage 4 lung non-small cell lung cancer. The patient refused chemotherapy. He was discharged home with hospice care. Conclusion The markedly elevated serum values of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin initially prompted the medical team to investigate <b>germinal</b> <b>tumors.</b> In the presence of a negative testicular ultrasound, workup was performed to find an extratesticular source of the tumor. Finally, the diagnosis was made with a tissue biopsy. This case illustrates that atypical markers can be seen in many cancers, emphasizing the role of immunohistochemistry and tissue biopsy in establishing the diagnosis. </p...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY- Elevated serum {{concentrations}} of alphal" fetoprotein were detected in rats 3 {{days after the}} injection of galactosamine. These elevations were temporally as" sociated {{with the proliferation of}} hepatocytes which occurred as a restitution response to the liver injury in-duced by galactosamine. -J Natl Cancer Inst 53 : 289 - 291, 1974. ALPHA 1 -FETOPROTEIN (a 1 F) is a serum potein with physical-chemical properties similar to albumin (1 - 3); it is found in only trace amounts in normal adult human (4) or rat (5) serum « 0. 06 JLg/ml) but in greatly elevated concentrations in fetal sera, pregnancy sera, or in the sera of individuals with hepatocellular cancer or <b>germinal</b> <b>tumors</b> (6 - 10). Elevated serum alF concentrations may also be associated with conditions of nonmalignant hepato-cellular proliferation such as viral hepatitis (8, 11 - 16) or, infrequently, cirrhosis (8, 14, 16, 17). In the rat, elevated serum ajF concentrations are observed after partial hepatectomy (1, 2, 18, 19) or the administration of CCI. (1, 2, 16). The elevations following partial hepatectomy occur just after waves of cellular proliferation (19). Recently liver-cell damage has been produced in rats by the administra-tion of galactosamine (Gal N) (20 - 24). The morpho-logic similarity of Gal N-induced liver injury to human viral hepatitis has been stressed (20, 23). In this study, we examined the effect of Gal N upon serum alF concentrations in the rat. Gal N induces a temporary elevation in the serum concentration of ajF similar to that seen after partial hepatectomy, which suggests that alF serum elevations follow the induction of division of hepatocytes during the reparative prolifera-tion response of the normal liver to Gal N-induced injury...|$|R
40|$|Most human B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas {{arise from}} {{germinal}} centers. Within these sites, the mismatch repair factor MSH 6 participates in antibody diversification.

40|$|The BOB. 1 /OBF. 1 /OCAB. 1 {{protein is}} a lymphocyte-specific {{transcriptional}} coactivator. It {{interacts with the}} Oct 1 and Oct 2 transcription factors and contributes to the transcriptional activity of octamer motifs. The analysis of established B cell lines had suggested that BOB. 1 /OBF. 1 is constitutively expressed at all stages of B cell development. Here we show that expression of BOB. 1 /OBF. 1 is regulated within the B cell lineage. Specifically, germinal center B cells show highly increased BOB. 1 /OBF. 1 levels. We can induce the up-regulation by stimulating primary splenic B cells, eg, by triggering CD 40 signaling {{in the presence of}} interleukin- 4. Expression of BOB. 1 /OBF. 1 is detectable but reduced in spleens from mice unable to undergo the germinal center reaction due to mutations in the TNF receptor p 55 or lymphotoxin β (LTβ) receptor genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that BOB. 1 /OBF. 1 expression is highly regulated in human B cell lymphomas. Whereas lymphomas representing pre- and postfollicular B cell developmental stages are negative for BOB. 1 /OBF. 1, high-level expression of BOB. 1 /OBF. 1 is characteristic of <b>germinal</b> center-derived <b>tumors.</b> In these tumors BOB. 1 /OBF. 1 is typically coexpressed with high levels of Bcl 6. These results imply that overexpression of BOB. 1 /OBF. 1, like overexpression of Bcl 6, might {{play a role in the}} pathogenesis of germinal center-derived B cell lymphomas.

40|$|The BCL- 6 gene is {{frequently}} involved in translocations occurring at the 3 q 27 locus and is rearranged in approximately 30 % of diffuse large cell lymphomas {{and in a}} small fraction of follicular lymphomas. The BCL- 6 gene encodes for a Kruppel-type zinc-finger protein, the cell/tissue expression and function of which is unknown. In this study, we describe a new monoclonal antibody (PG-B 6) that is specifically directed against a fixative-sensitive epitope on the amino-terminal region of the BCL- 6 protein. By immunocytochemical analysis, BCL- 6 localizes in the nucleus where PG-B 6 staining gives a microgranular/diffuse pattern with exclusion of the nucleoli. The main reactivity of PG-B 6 in tonsil and spleen is with the nuclei of germinal center B cells, whereas B cells within the mantle and marginal zones do not express BCL- 6. No other lymphoid cells in the tonsil express BCL- 6 except for a subset of CD 3 +/CD 4 + intrafollicular and interfollicular T cells. A few lymphoid cells of unknown phenotype express BCL- 6 in the thymus. Extra-lymphoid BCL- 6 expression includes a weak nuclear positivity of epithelia. In non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, BCL- 6 expression parallels that observed in normal lymphoid compartments, eg, expression in <b>germinal</b> center-derived <b>tumors</b> (follicular and diffuse large cell lymphomas), but not in mantle cell and marginal zone lymphomas. In most diffuse large cell lymphomas, the BCL- 6 protein is expressed at high levels in cases with or without BCL- 6 gene rearrangements. These findings indicate that BCL- 6 expression is specifically regulated during B lymphocyte development and suggest that BCL- 6 may play a role during B cell differentiation in the germinal center...|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{to define}} {{predictors}} that influence longevity {{in patients with}} recurrent non-seminomatous <b>germinal</b> testicular <b>tumors</b> (NGTT) on standard second-line chemotherapy (CT) including cisplatin and iphosphamide. Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical packages Graph Pad Prism 4. 00 for Windows and SPSS 15. 0 for Windows. Subjects and methods. Case history data were analyzed in 693 patients with disseminated NGTT who had received current CT and followed up at the Department of Clinical Pharmacology and CT, N. N. Blokhin Russian Cancer Research Center, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. The median follow-up was 32 (range 3 - 215) months. The disease progressed in 181 (26 %) patients. Detailed information was available {{on the nature of}} second-line CT in only 138 patients. Half (71 (51. 7 %) of the 138 patients had second-line CT including iphosphamide. Uni- and multivariate analyses were made to identify predictors that influence longevity in patients with recurrent NGTT on standard secondline CT including cisplatin and iphosphamide. Results. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 32 % (95 % confidence interval 25 - 41 %). The multivariate analysis showed the morphological pattern of a primary tumor (a yolk sac tumor component), a pre-induction CT lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of ?d 1. 5 units of the upper normal range, progression during induction CT, and a pre-second-line CT LDH level of ?d  1000 U/l to be negative predictors. According to the number of negative factors, the patients were classified into 3 groups: 1) good prognosis [n = 10 (14 %) of the 71 patients], 100 % 3 -year OS; 2) intermediate prognosis (one negative factor) [n = 33 (46. 5 %) of the 71 patients], 50. 2 % 3 -year OS; 3) poor prognosis (?d  2 negative factors), 6. 7 % 3 -year OS. Conclusion. Standard iphosphamide-containing therapy enables all patients to be treated in the good prognosis group of those with recurrent NGTT.

40|$|The two {{dominant}} {{models of}} carcinogenesis postulate stochastic (clonal evolution) or hierarchic organization of tumor ({{cancer stem cell}} model). According to the latter, at the <b>germinal</b> center of <b>tumor</b> evolution is a cancer stem cell (CSC) which, similar to normal adult stem cells, possesses the capacity of self-renewal and a differentiation potential. Over the past few years, compelling evidence has emerged {{in support of the}} hierarchic cancer model for many solid tumors including hepatocellular cancers. The CSCs are posited to be responsible not only for tumor initiation but also for the generation of distant metastasis and relapse after therapy.

Identification and detailed characterization of liver CSCs is therefore imperative for improving prevention approaches, enhancing early detection, and extending the limited treatment options.

One (5 %) patient had ascites. Using the IOTA terms and definitions, all but one dysgerminoma were moderately (43 %) or very well (50 %) vascularized solid tumors. One tumor was multilocular-solid. According to pattern recognition, most dysgerminomas were highly vascularized, purely solid tumors with heterogeneous internal echogenicity divided into several lobules, had a smooth and sometimes lobulated contour and were well-defined relative to the surrounding organs. Conclusion The ultrasound finding of a highly vascularized, large, solid, lobulated adnexal mass with irregular internal echogenicity in a woman 20 - 30 years old should raise the suspicion of ovarian dysgerminoma.

40|$|SUMMARY-The {{incidence}} of malignant {{tumors of the}} testis in developed white populations varied sharply in space and time. The contemporary distribution has been bimodal, with high death rates in young adults and the elderly. About 1910, rates in the young were low {{and those in the}} elderly were higher than today. The age-specific trends were simply related to each other. In recent years the incidence and mortality rates have been similar in the U. S. white population, England and Wales, and Sweden. The rates for Denmark and Norway were substantially higher. The distribu-tion of the tumors by age of the host and pathologic type was similar in these countries, in spite of the variation in incidence. The data showed that there are two major environmental etiologic factors in tumors of the testis, which suggested that the <b>germinal</b> cell <b>tumors</b> of the testis are derived at all ages from tissue predisposed in early life. -J Natl Cancer Inst 49 : 339 - 354, 1972. MORTALITY from malignant tumors of the testis in whites today shows a distribution by age which has two peaks-one in young adults and one in the elderly (1 - 3) (text-fig. 1). This pattern is not stable-the death rate in young adults is rising (1, 3, 4), and relationships at all ages are changing (5). Incidence data are only available for recent decades, but have risen sharply for young men in Denmark (6, 7). The incidence and mor-tality data for the U. S. white population, England and Wales, and the Scandinavian countries are analyzed to further clarify these changes. by age. Until 1933, the statistics referred to only the Death Registration States-this probably did not matter since the populations were accurately known, and Texas was the only State missing by 1933. From 1930 - 38, the number of deaths were published by 5 -year age groups for malignant tumors of the testis, and mortality rates could be calculated. In 1939, the tabulation was reduced.

Methods The Registry of Cancer in Children, started in 1996 in the IMSS-MC, is an on-going, prospective register. The data from 1996 through 2001 were analyzed and the different types of cancer were grouped according to the International Classification for Cancer in Children (ICCC). From this analysis, the general and specific frequencies by age and by sex were obtained for the different groups of neoplasms. Also, the frequency of the stage of the disease that had been diagnosed in cases of children with solid tumors was obtained. Results A total of 1, 702 new cases of children with cancer were registered, with the male/female ratio at 1. 1 / 1. Leukemias had the highest frequency with 784 cases (46. 1 %) and, of these, acute lymphoblastic leukemias were the most prevalent with 614 cases (78. 3 %). Thereafter, in descending order of frequency, were tumors of the central nervous system (CNST) with 197 cases (11. 6 %), lymphomas with 194 cases (11. 4 %), <b>germinal</b> cell <b>tumors</b> with 110 cases (6. 5 %), and bone tumors with 97 cases (5. 7 %). The highest frequency of cancer was found in the group of one to four year-olds that had 627 cases (36. 8 %). In all the age groups, leukemias were the most frequent. In the present work, the frequency of Hodgkin's disease (~ 4 %) was found to be lower than that (~ 10 %) in previous studies and the frequency of tumors of the sympathetic nervous system was low (2. 3 %). Of those cases of solid tumors for which the stage of the disease had been determined, 66. 9 % were diagnosed as being Stage III or IV. Conclusions The principal cancers in the children treated in the IMSS-MC were leukemias, CNST, and lymphomas, consistent with those reported by developed countries. A 2. 5 -fold reduction in the frequency of Hodgkin's disease was found. Of the children, the stage of whose disease had been determined, two thirds were diagnosed as having advanced stages of the disease. </p...|$|R
