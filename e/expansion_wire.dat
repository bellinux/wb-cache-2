Such preferential evaporation and directional diffusion of atoms resulted in an intriguing axial shrinkage and an abnormal radial <b>expansion</b> of the <b>wire.</b> It was also observed that with the beam energy deposition rate being lowered, although both the diffusion and the evaporation slowed down, the processing transferred from an evaporation-dominated status to a diffusion-dominated status.|$|R

30|$|Considering {{electronic}} devices, {{the fatigue}} failure occurs more frequently under cyclic loadings. In a daily {{use of an}} electronic device, we switch some transistors on and off such that heat is produced on the component and traces as well as vias (wires conducting electric signals). This heat increases {{the temperature of the}} circuit board. As a consequence, copper and the composite material try to expand differently—regarding their coefficients of thermal expansion—so-called thermal stresses occur. Unfortunately, such stresses are higher than the yield stress such that plastic deformation is induced. Since the produced heat escapes the device by an active or passive cooling, the electronic device tries to shrink or expand to its original shape. Due to the plastic deformation, this shape change generates stresses again. Hence a cyclic loading implies a plastic deformation in each cycle. The plastic deformation is irreversible and in each cycle the amount of plastic deformation accumulates. Sooner or later, there appear cracks caused by fatigue. In order to prevent these cracks, we may try to match the constants of thermal <b>expansion</b> of <b>wire</b> and composite material. Therefore, a possible improvement of fatigue properties in a circuit board relies on the choice of the composite material. In this study we investigate a non-conventional composite material and its effect to the reliability of the circuit board by using computation of thermo-electro-mechanical simulations.|$|R

40|$|We propose an {{optimization}} {{method for}} power distribution network that explicitly deals with timing.

40|$|Wire {{explosion}} {{experiments have}} been carried out at the University of Nevada, Reno. These experiments investigated the explosion phase of wires with properties and current-driving conditions comparable to that used in the initial stage of wire array z-pinch implosions on the Z machine at Sandia National Laboratories. Specifically, current pulses similar to and faster than the pre-pulse current on Z (current prior to fast rise in current pulse) were applied to single wire loads to study wire heating and the early development of plasmas in the wire initiation process. Understanding such issues are important to larger pulsed power machines that implode cylindrical wire array loads comprised of many wires. It is thought that the topology of an array prior to its acceleration influences the implosion and final stagnation properties, and therefore may depend on the initiation phase of the wires. Single wires ranging from 4 to 40 pm in diameter and comprised of material ranging from AI to W were investigated. Several diagnostics were employed to determine wire current, voltage, total emitted-light energy and power, along with the <b>wire</b> <b>expansion</b> velocity throughout the explosion. In a number of cases, the explosion process was also observed with x-ray backlighting using x-pinches. The experimental data indicates that the characteristics of a wire explosion depend dramatically on the rate of rise of the current, on the diameter of the wire, and on the heat of vaporization of the wire material. In this report, these characteristics will be described in detail. Of particular interest is the result that a faster current rise produces a higher energy deposition into the wire prior to explosion. This result introduces a different means of increasing the efficiency of wire heating. In this case, the energy deposition along the wire and its subsequent expansion, is uniform compared to a ''slow'' current rise (170 A/ns compared to 22 A /s current rise into a short circuit) and the expansion velocity is larger. The energy deposition and <b>wire</b> <b>expansion</b> is further modified by the wire diameter and material. Investigations of wire diameter indicate that the diameter primarily effects the expansion velocity and energy deposition; thicker wires explode with greater velocities but absorb less energy per atom. The heat of vaporization also categorizes the wire explosion; wires with a low heat of vaporization expand faster and emit less radiation than their high heat of vaporization counterparts...|$|R

The results of SEM indicated both a measurement component and a structural component of the underlying model were plausible. Based on the adequacy of overall model fit, the study was able to further test the proposed hypotheses. The test results reveal that citizens are more willing to involve transactional e-government services when they have greater overall trust belief toward e-government web sites and government itself.

The project purpose is to design a facility which permits the measurement and study of the three dimensional wall jets using water and meant to use optical devices to measure the properties of the flow. After a deep review of the literature, I started to find the way to design in the most accurate manner the test section of the facility.

When a voltage was applied with oscillating polarity, the biofilm attached to the wire expanded and contracted. The biofilm expanded by approximately 4 % when the wire was cathodic but was reduced to 74 % of the original thickness when the wire was anodic. The phenomenon was reproduced by alternately flushing the flow cell with media adjusted to pH 3 and pH 10 with no electric current.

This may be beneficial for fast ignition, since not only were more electrons with lower energies seen in the experiment but also the lower prepulse intensity will reduce the amount of preplasma present on arrival of the main pulse, reducing the distance the hot electrons have to travel.

A 0. 33 % absolute higher performance of MBB against the established H-pattern solar cell has already been demonstrated by Braun [1]. This work focuses on the interconnection of Multi Busbar cells (MBB) by infrared soldering and the optimization of the front metallization design in order to achieve reliable solder joints. We find the following factors to be crucial for the MBB-interconnection process: a homogeneous radiation field, a process-adapted downholder device, a homogeneous wire coating, a precise wire positioning and a method to absorb the <b>wire</b> <b>expansion</b> caused by the elevated solder temperatures. We measure peel forces up to 5. 7 N/mm as the average peel force value of five pad rows from the center of two MBB cells containing 160 soldered pads. Furthermore a one-cell MBB-module shows a more homogeneous series resistance with an approximately 0. 3 Omega cm(2) lower series resistance compared to a one-cell 3 -busbar module, which we determine by C-DCR (coupled determination of the dark saturation current and the series resistance). Finally two 20 -cell MBB modules manufactured with an automated MBB-stringer pass the TC- 200 test without significant changes in IV, EL and module optical appearance...|$|R
40|$|High {{engineering}} {{critical current}} density JE of > 500 A/mm 2 at 20 T and 4. 2 K can be regularly achieved in Ag-sheathed multifilamentary Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 Ox (Bi- 2212) round wire when the sample length is several centimeters. However, JE(20 T) in Bi- 2212 wires of several meters length, {{as well as}} longer pieces wound in coils, rarely exceeds 200 A/mm 2. Moreover, long-length wires often exhibit signs of Bi- 2212 leakage after melt processing that are rarely found in short, open-end samples. We studied the length dependence of JE of state-of-the-art powder-in-tube (PIT) Bi- 2212 wires and gases released by them during melt processing using mass spectroscopy, confirming that JE degradation with length is due to wire swelling produced by high internal gas pressures at elevated temperatures [1, 2]. We further modeled the gas transport in Bi- 2212 wires and examined the <b>wire</b> <b>expansion</b> at critical stages of the melt processing of as-drawn PIT wires and the wires that received a degassing treatment or a cold-densification treatment before melt processing. These investigations showed that internal gas pressure in long-length wires drives creep of the Ag sheath during the heat treatment, causing wire to expand, lowering the density of Bi- 2212 filaments, and therefore degrading the wire JE; the creep rupture of silver sheath naturally leads to the leakage of Bi- 2212 liquid. Our work shows that proper control of such creep {{is the key to}} preventing Bi- 2212 leakage and achieving high JE in long-length Bi- 2212 conductors and coils...|$|R
