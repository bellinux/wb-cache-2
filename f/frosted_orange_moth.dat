50|$|The <b>frosted</b> <b>orange</b> <b>moth</b> (Gortyna flavago) is a moth of the Noctuidae family {{which is}} found in Europe, Armenia, Syria and east through the Palearctic to western Siberia. It has also been {{recorded}} in Algeria. The frosted orange is a night-flying species with orange and brown speckled wings allow for perfect camouflage against autumn leaves in the daytime. It is attracted to light and does not come to flowers, and its larva inhabit the stems and roots of the species' food plants.|$|E

50|$|Thaumatotibia (Cryptophlebia) leucotreta, {{commonly}} known as the false codling <b>moth,</b> <b>orange</b> <b>moth,</b> citrus codling <b>moth</b> or <b>orange</b> codling <b>moth,</b> is a moth in the Tortricidae family under the order of Lepidoptera.

40|$|A {{resident}} {{population of the}} yellow-headed fireworm, Acleris minuta (Robinson) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is established in the commercial nurseries of southwestern Iowa. This species sporadically reaches pest status causing considerable damage to rosaceous and ericaceous plantings;A conceptual life system model has been constructed to explain the bionomics of A. minuta populations. The conceptual model consists of an ovipositional subsystem, a developmental subsystem for larval instars 1 - 4, a developmental subsystem for larval instars 5, 6, 2 ̆ 6 7 under a summer and winter color morph scheme, and an overwintering subsystem;Acleris minuta is a multivoltine pest with 4 discrete generations in southwestern Iowa. The adult moths are seasonally dimorphic. Adults from the first 3 generations emerge as <b>orange</b> <b>moths,</b> while adults from the fourth generation emerge as gray <b>moths.</b> <b>Orange</b> <b>moths</b> are capable of mating on day 1 post emergence between the hours of 0500 - 0800 CDST. Gray moths which emerge in the fall are not capable of mating even if environmental conditions are favorable. Apparently, {{both males and females}} overwinter and mate in the spring;Larval development proceeds through 5 stadia, 6 stadia, or 7 stadia. Reduced growth rates caused by nutrient deficiencies and other adverse environmental conditions increase the frequencies of supernumerary molts. The 6 and 7 instar modes of development are more prevalent during the fourth generation;Laboratory and ecological life tables have been constructed. Ten species of parasitoids caused significant mortality during 1977 and 1978...|$|R
50|$|Dichomeris citrifoliella, the <b>orange</b> webworm <b>moth,</b> is a moth in the Gelechiidae family. It was {{described}} by Chambers in 1880. It is found in North America, {{where it has been}} recorded from Michigan and Wisconsin to Florida and Texas.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Orange</b> Sallow <b>Moth</b> or Aureolaria Seed Borer (Rhodoecia aurantiago) is {{a species}} of moth of the Noctuidae family. It has a {{scattered}} distribution from southern Maine and the hills around Boston, Massachusetts, west across southern Ontario to south-western Wisconsin and Missouri, south into Florida and Texas.|$|R

5000|$|This is a {{steeply sloping}} hill, {{which is a}} fine example of grazed chalk {{grassland}} in the southern Buckinghamshire Chilterns. There is a wide variety of plants, some of which provide food for the larvae of important butterflies on the site. Two butterflies are rare, the silver spotted skipper [...] and the Adonis blue. Another rare invertebrate is the <b>orange</b> clearwing <b>moth.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fifehead Wood {{provides}} the light <b>orange</b> underwing <b>moth</b> (Archiearis notha) with its sole Dorset residence. The site {{also has a}} large variety of butterflies, such as the white admiral (Limenitis camilla) and the purple hairstreak (Neozephyrus quercus).Breeding populations of several different birds inhabit Fifehead Wood. Grey heron and great spotted woodpeckers may be spotted,and treecreepers can also be observed spiraling within the habitat, as they ascend tree trunks in a progression of small hops.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flowers of}} Monarda bradburiana produce copious {{quantities}} of nectar and are attractive to bumblebees and other long-tongued bees, butterflies, hummingbird moths, beeflies and hummingbirds. Pollen is harvested by halictid bees which cannot reach the nectar, and a specialist pollinator is Doufourea monardae, {{a small black}} bee. This is a food plant for the caterpillars of the hermit sphinx, the gray marvel, the <b>orange</b> mint <b>moth</b> and the raspberry pyrausta moth. Herbivorous mammals tend to avoid the foliage, perhaps because it has an odour of oregano.|$|R
50|$|Orange County {{was formed}} in 1852 from {{portions}} of Jefferson County. It was named after the orange fruit, the common citrus fruit grown by the early settlers of this County {{near the mouth of}} the Sabine River.Due to periodic spells of quite cold winter weather (<b>frosts)</b> in <b>Orange</b> County, it is no longer the home of orange trees and citrus orchards. The production of those fruits in Texas long ago was moved a long way southwest into the Rio Grande Valley, where the weather is almost always warm all winter long. Citrus trees produce their fruit in the wintertime, which makes them especially vulnerable to frost and icy weather.|$|R
50|$|For Digital Delay, Frost uses a Boss DD-6 pedal and a Line 6 DL4 Modeler stompbox, as well {{as using}} MXR M-106 6-Band Graphic EQ, {{and a number of}} Electro-Harmonix effects {{including}} an Electro-Harmonix POG, Holy Stain and Holy Grail, whilst using an Orange Channel Footswitch. During the recording of Not Accepted Anywhere, the album sleeve states that <b>Frost</b> uses both <b>Orange</b> and Marshall guitar amplifiers.|$|R
50|$|The snacks are {{typically}} wrapped, individual portions of food, {{such as a}} brownie cookie, snack cake, bag of peanuts, or a Moon Pie, usually in the flavors of chocolate, banana, or <b>orange</b> <b>frosted</b> marshmallow cake. Several newer flavors of coconut, vanilla, mint, peanut butter, and salted caramel have been added, over the years. The tossed snacks have also included various bags of pork rinds crackers. Other snacks include dried fruits and whole bags of candy and gum.|$|R
50|$|The adult moth has black wings {{with white}} {{markings}} {{on both the}} forewings and hindwings. The forewings have two white spots that are more elongated while the hindwing only has a single spot near to the centre; the wingspan is 35-45 mm. The thorax and abdomen of the moth are black with bands of <b>orange.</b> The magpie <b>moth</b> is diurnal which, coupled with its colourful markings means it is often mistaken for a butterfly. It is most active from September to June in the mornings and evenings {{where it can be}} seen flying over the tops of host plants.|$|R
50|$|Citrus {{trees are}} not {{generally}} <b>frost</b> hardy. Mandarin <b>oranges</b> (C. reticulata) {{tend to be}} the hardiest of the common Citrus species and can withstand short periods down to as cold as −10 C, but realistically temperatures not falling below −2 C are required for successful cultivation. Tangerines, tangors and yuzu can be grown outside even in regions with more marked sub-freezing temperatures in winter, although this may affect fruit quality. A few hardy hybrids can withstand temperatures well below freezing, but do not produce quality fruit. Lemons can be commercially grown in cooler-summer/moderate-winter, coastal Southern California, because sweetness is neither attained nor expected in retail lemon fruit. The related trifoliate orange (Citrus trifoliata) can survive below −20 C; its fruit are astringent and inedible unless cooked but a few better-tasting cultivars and hybrids have been developed (see citranges).The trees thrive in a consistently sunny, humid environment with fertile soil and adequate rainfall or irrigation. Abandoned trees in valleys may suffer, yet survive, the dry summer of Central California's Inner Coast Ranges. At any age citrus grows well enough with infrequent irrigation in partial shade, but the fruit crop is smaller. Being of tropical and sub-tropical origin, oranges, like all citrus, are broadleaved and evergreen. They do not drop leaves except when stressed. The stems of many varieties have large sharp thorns. The trees flower in the spring, and fruit is set shortly afterward. Fruit begins to ripen in fall or early winter months, depending on cultivar, and develops increasing sweetness afterward. Some cultivars of tangerines ripen by winter. Some, such as the grapefruit, may take up to eighteen months to ripen.|$|R
