40|$|The {{prevalence}} of {{low back pain}} (LBP) was investigated in 598 Italian professional drivers exposed to whole-body vibration (WBV) and ergonomic risk factors (drivers of earth moving machines, fork-lift truck drivers, truck drivers, bus <b>drivers).</b> The control <b>group</b> consisted of {{a small sample of}} 30 fire inspectors not exposed to WBV. Personal, occupational and health histories were collected by means of a structured questionnaire. Vibration measurements were performed on representative samples of the machines and vehicles used by the <b>driver</b> <b>groups.</b> From the vibration magnitudes and exposure durations, alternative measures of vibration dose were estimated for each subject. Daily vibration exposure, expressed in terms of 8 -h energy-equivalent frequency-weighted acceleration, A(8), averaged 0. 28 – 0. 61 (range 0. 10 – 1. 18) ms 2 rms in the <b>driver</b> <b>groups.</b> Duration of exposure to WBV ranged between 1 and 41 years. The 7 -day and 12 -month {{prevalence of}} LBP was greater in the <b>driver</b> <b>groups</b> than in the controls. In the professional drivers, the occurrence of 12 -month LBP, high intensity of LBP (Von Korff pain scale score X 5), and LBP disability (Roland & Morris disability scale score X 12) significantly increased with increasing cumulative vibration exposure. Even though several alternative measures of vibration exposure were associated with LBP outcomes, nevertheless a more regular trend of association with LBP was found for vibration dose expressed as Paviti (m s 2 h), in which the frequency-weighted acceleration, av, and lifetime exposure duration, t, were given equal weight. In multivariate data analysis, individual characteristics (e. g. age, body mass index) and a physical load index (derived from combining manual materials handling and awkward postures) were significantly associated with LBP outcomes, while psychosocial work factors (e. g. job decision, job support) showed a marginal relation to LBP. This study tends to confirm that professional driving in industry is associated with an increased risk of work-related LBP. Exposure to WBV and physical loading factors at work are important components of the multifactorial origin of LBP in professional drivers...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} neurological outcome in road traffic accidents (RTA) with spinal cord injury (SCI). The study was undertaken in National Spinal Unit of Special Medical Rehabilitation Hospital, in Vara`dinske Toplice, Croatia. Hospital records of 154 inpatient RTA SCI patients, in years 1991 – 2001 were reviewed. Six groups of patients were formed: car drivers, co-drivers, back seat passengers, motorcycle drivers, bicycle drivers and pedestrians. Neurological assessments at admission to rehabilitation and before discharge were done according to American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale. Methods of descriptive statistics were used. Overall 49 % of RTA SCI patients presented with complete injury (ASIA A) at admission to rehabilitation, 93 % of initially complete spinal cord injured patients remained complete at discharge and 72 % previously non-ambulatory incomplete (ASIA B-E) patients achieved ambulation. Complete injury was acquired more often in motorcycle drivers and car <b>drivers</b> <b>group</b> (67 % and 54 %, respectively). Road traffic spinal cord injuries are, and will remain the leading cause of traumatic SCI, with high proportion of complete injury at rehabilitation onset, especially in motorcycle drivers and car <b>drivers</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R
40|$|Since Greenwood and Woods' (1919) {{study in}} {{tendency}} of accident, many researchers {{have insisted that}} various human factors (sensation seeking, anger, anxiety) are highly correlated with reckless driving and traffic accidents. Oh and Lee (2011) designed the Driving Behavior Determinants Questionnaire, a psychological tool to predict danger level of drivers and discriminate them into three groups (normal, unintentionally reckless, and intentionally reckless) by their characteristics, attitude, and expected reckless behavior level. This tool's overall accuracy of discrimination was 70 %. This study aimed {{to prove that the}} discrimination reflects the behavioral difference of drivers. Twenty-four young drivers were requested to react to the visual stimuli (tests for subjective speed sense, simple visual reaction time, and left turning at own risk). The results showed no differences in subjective speed sense among the <b>driver</b> <b>groups,</b> which means drivers' excessive speeding behaviors occur due to intention based on personality and attitude, not because of sensory disorders. In addition, there were no differences in simple reaction time among <b>driver</b> <b>groups.</b> However, the results of the ‘Left turning at drivers’ own risk task” revealed significant group differences. All reckless drivers showed a greater degree of dangerous left turning behaviors than the normal group did...|$|R

40|$|Understanding and {{predicting}} a driver’s behaviors {{in a vehicle}} is a prospective function embedded in a smart car. Beyond the patterns of observable behaviors, driver’s intention could be identified based on goal-driven behaviors. A computational model to classify driver intention in visual search which is finding a target with one’s eyes as moving selective attention across a search field, could improve the level of intelligence that a smart car could demonstrate. To develop a computational cognitive that explains the underlying cognitive process and reproduces drivers’ behaviors, particular parameters in human cognitive process should be specified. In this study, 2 issues are considered as influential factors on a driver’s eye movements: a driver’s visual information processing characteristics (VIPCs) {{and the purpose of}} visual search. To assess an individual’s VIPC, 4 psychological experiments&# 8212;Donders’s reaction time, mental rotation, signal detection, and Stroop experiments&# 8212;were utilized. Upon applying k-means clustering method, 114 drivers were divided into 9 <b>driver</b> <b>groups.</b> To investigate the influence of task goal on a driver’s eye movement, driving simulation was conducted to collect a driver’s eye movement data under the given purpose of visual search (perceptual and cognitive tasks). The empirical data showed that there were significant differences in a driver’s oculomotor behavior, such as response time, average fixation time, and average glance duration between the <b>driver</b> <b>groups</b> and the purposes of visual search. The effectiveness of using VIPC for <b>grouping</b> <b>drivers</b> was tested with task goal classification model by comparing the models’ performance when <b>drivers</b> were <b>grouped</b> by typical demographic data such as gender. Results show that grouping based on VIPC improves accuracy and stability of prediction of the model on a driver’s intention underlying visual search behaviors. This study would benefit future studies focusing on personalization and adaptive interfaces in the development of smart car. Copyright &# 169; Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. close 0...|$|R
