Barns of this type {{were based on a}} longitudinal frame, with two rows of posts connected by arcade plates. Because such barns tend to be both long and high, they experience high structural loads from the wind. They therefore have numerous <b>internal</b> <b>braces,</b> acting {{in much the same way}} as buttresses, to strengthen the structure. This gives the barn its distinctive internal appearance, with a lattice of beams and braces holding up the roof.

Opinions by collectors have indicated that the Elias Howe instruments had a pressed soundboard, which kept its shape with <b>internal</b> <b>braces.</b> The Howe-Orme guitar also shared the adjustable neck system.|$|E
5000|$|The barn {{measures}} 58.55 m long, 11.3 m wide, and 11.9 m high, with twelve bays, {{running in}} a north-south direction. It occupies a footprint of about 661 m2 and has an internal volume of about [...] There are three doors {{on the east side}} to permit the entry of wagons. The exterior of the barn is weatherboarded, with a hipped tiled roof. It was originally a much larger structure, with two wings, but the north wing was dismantled in 1774 and rebuilt in the now-demolished hamlet of Heathrow, {{on the site of the}} modern airport. The vast majority of the surviving structure is original; it has been estimated that 95 per cent of the timbers, including the external weatherboarding, have survived from the original building. It has been described by English Heritage as [...] "a supreme example of late-medieval craftsmanship - a masterpiece of carpentry containing one of the best and most intact interiors of its age and type in all of Europe."It is an outstanding example of a late medieval aisled barn and is the largest timber-framed building in England. Barns of this type were based on a longitudinal frame, with two rows of posts connected by arcade plates. Because such barns tend to be both long and high, they experience high structural loads from the wind. They therefore have numerous <b>internal</b> <b>braces,</b> acting in much the same way as buttresses, to strengthen the structure. This gives the barn its distinctive internal appearance, with a lattice of beams and braces holding up the roof. The techniques used in its construction are similar to those employed on the great cathedrals being built at the time, and some of the same craftsmen were probably involved.The barn's main posts are made of oak. Each is about 14 in square and sits on a block of Reigate sandstone, a common building material in medieval London. The posts were cut into shape using axes, adzes and saws, the marks from which can still be seen in some instances. The builders cut and fitted the timberwork together on the ground and scratched Roman numerals, called assembly marks, on the joints to indicate where pieces of timber were to be combined. Some of the pairs of main posts were made from the trunks of very large individual trees which were cut in two. They were all placed upside down, relative to the original direction of the tree. This was because the bottom of a tree is always wider than the top; the greater width was needed to accommodate the joints with the beams that support the roof. Despite the care that the builders took to get the joints right, they may have made some mistakes along the way, as some of the timbers have holes for pegs and mortises that were never used. Alternatively, the timbers may have been reused from another construction.The rows of arcade posts support tie beams, with curved braces to strengthen the frame. The collar beam, which supports the opposing principal rafters, is supported by the crown post. Roof purlins run the length of the barn and are tenoned into the principal rafters, with additional support from curved wind braces. Some aspects of this design are unusual, both in the way that they are executed and in terms of their early date. A number of features in the barn's carpentry are described by English Heritage as [...] "experimental, precocious and regionally unusual," [...] which is attributed to the very high level of skill of the master carpenters who built it.|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the clinical results of an arthroscopic modified Brostrom operation with an <b>internal</b> <b>brace</b> through comparison with an arthroscopic modified Brostrom operation without an <b>internal</b> <b>brace.</b> We hypothesized that an arthroscopic modified Brostrom operation with <b>internal</b> <b>bracing</b> could be useful for early rehabilitation and obtaining satisfactory clinical results.|$|R

30|$|As {{far as the}} <b>internal</b> <b>brace</b> is {{concerned}} [33], a non-absorbable braided suture is put via a suture passing device through the proximal end of the torn ACL. The <b>internal</b> <b>brace</b> comprises a non-absorbable braided tape which is placed on a fixation device. The construct is pulled through the drilled tibial tunnel and, afterwards, up into the femoral tunnel via the passing sutures. The fixation device is put onto the lateral surface of the femur. The distal end of the <b>internal</b> <b>brace</b> {{is placed in the}} tibial metaphysis via a bioabsorbable suture anchor screw.|$|R
40|$|AbstractExcavations in urban–developed {{areas were}} {{commonly}} supported by diaphragm walls with <b>internal</b> <b>braces</b> or tieback anchors. There are still required the necessary civil works {{to serve the}} demands and also to solve the environmental problems. Wales and cross-lot struts {{are by far the}} predominant method for wall support, the large working space inside the excavation provided by a tieback anchor system has a significant construction advantage. This paper aims to evaluate the soil stiffness parameters of the alluvial Taipei soil for tie-back diaphragm wall based on back analysis of case study. The case histories of the Taipei County Administration Centre (TCAC) and NTU Hospital (NTUH) were studied in this paper. The deformation analysis was carried out by available finite element analysis tool using PLAXIS. In the analysis, beam element method together with an elastic perfect plastic soil model was used to design the diaphragm wall and the tieback anchor system. The soil was modelled as Mohr-Coulomb model. According to the basic design, the clay deposits are modelled as undrained behaviour while silty-sand behaves in drained condition. The simulation results show that the maximum horizontal movement occurred at around the bottom of wall. At the final stage of construction, the root mean square deviation (RSMD) between measured and calculated the wall movement was 4 % and 7 % respectively at TCAC and NTUH sites. It was concluded that tied-back diaphragm wall can be satisfactorily modelled using elasto-plastic Mohr-Coulomb soil model. The predicted soil's modulus of elasticity can be obtained from the SPT-N relationship, for clay deposit layer and for silty-sand deposit...|$|E
30|$|According to our results, the {{patients}} who underwent the Brostrom repair with an <b>internal</b> <b>brace</b> were allowed early rehabilitation without the need of early protection. Improvement of AOFAS score from before surgery to two weeks after surgery was statistically significant in {{the patients}} with an <b>internal</b> <b>brace</b> (p <  0.001), whereas improvement of AOFAS score from before surgery to six weeks after surgery was statistically significant in the patients without an <b>internal</b> <b>brace</b> (p =  0.001).

30|$|According to Smith et al. [33], the {{temporary}} <b>internal</b> <b>brace</b> (Arthrex) {{might be a}} very interesting solution for children with open periarticular physes who experience an ACL rupture. Requirement for this treatment is an adequate ACL remnant, which permits direct repair. The major disadvantage {{of this study is}} that it includes only 3 patients in a 2 -year follow-up with no comparison to other treatment options. The excellent results cannot be taken into serious consideration before a larger series will be published. This was the only clinical study that we found concerning the <b>internal</b> <b>brace,</b> so there was no trial in adult populations apart from a case report with excellent results [44]. In a preclinical canine model, Cook et al. illustrated that using a quadriceps tendon allograft with <b>internal</b> <b>brace</b> (QTIB) prevented early failure, allowed for direct, four-zone graft-to-bone healing, and functional graft remodeling while avoiding problems noted with use of all-synthetic grafts [29]. Despite that, the use of a quadriceps allograft in combination with the synthetic <b>internal</b> <b>brace</b> is totally different than the clinical study in children, where the <b>internal</b> <b>brace</b> device was used without any graft to improve self-healing of the native ACL.|$|R

The American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) score was administered to assess the functional status.

30|$|Our search {{resulted}} {{in only one}} animal study about <b>internal</b> <b>brace,</b> while no cadaveric studies were found. The aim of this study, by Cook et al., was to describe a canine model for all-inside arthroscopic complete ACL reconstruction, {{with the use of}} a quadriceps tendon allograft with <b>internal</b> <b>brace</b> (QTIB) [29]. Ten animals underwent complete transection of the native ACL followed by all-inside ACL reconstruction with the QTIB construct with suspensory fixation, while 10 contralateral knees were used as controls. The dogs were evaluated over a 6 -month period using a range of outcome measures required for preclinical animal models, and it was shown that the use of <b>internal</b> <b>brace</b> for ACL reconstruction could effectively contribute to knee stability and improve function without causing premature osteoarthritis.|$|R

30|$|Our search {{resulted}} in one clinical study [33] and a case report, which was excluded from our analysis [44]. Smith et al. investigated {{the outcomes of}} ACL repair {{with the use of}} an <b>internal</b> <b>brace</b> (Arthrex) in a small series of three children [33]. Two children with a complete proximal ACL rupture and a third with a concomitant tibial spine avulsion underwent direct surgical repair, enhanced with an <b>internal</b> <b>brace,</b> which was removed after 3  months [33]. The authors noted that this method led to complete ACL healing and knee stability 3  months after surgery, a return to normal activities was done at 4  months, and excellent knee function without growth disturbance was found beyond 2  years [33]. The study demonstrated that <b>internal</b> <b>brace</b> could be an attractive alternative to ACL reconstruction, where an adequate ACL remnant allows direct repair [33].|$|R

Furthermore, the rate of returning to sports at 12  weeks after surgery showed a significant difference between the two groups (p <  0.001). There was no difference between anterior drawer test and rate of complications (p =  0.882).|$|R

50|$|The {{site was}} {{previously}} {{occupied by a}} city-owned parking garage, two four story brick buildings, and a parking lot. After demolition of these structures, a slurry wall was installed around the perimeter, in panels 8-22 feet long. The soil within the slurry was then excavated, and <b>internal</b> <b>bracing</b> installed, with tiebacks along some of the wall. Once the excavation was completed, large spread footings were placed for the internal columns. The below grade parking garage floors were then placed, while erection of the steel frame commenced above. This {{is known as the}} up-up approach (as opposed to up-down). As each floor was placed and cured, the <b>internal</b> <b>bracing</b> was removed. This method allowed the foundation to be installed within feet of the existing structures, without any settlement of those structures.|$|R

50|$|In general, bracing {{allows a}} stronger, lighter {{structure}} than {{one which is}} unbraced, but external bracing in particular adds drag which slows down the aircraft and raises considerably more design issues than <b>internal</b> <b>bracing.</b> Another disadvantage of bracing wires is that they require routine checking and adjustment, or rigging, even when located internally.|$|R
