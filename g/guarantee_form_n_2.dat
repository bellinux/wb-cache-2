In all CunNCO clusters, the NCO species prefered to occupy the single-fold coordination site and the small copper cluster tended to bond with the nitric. The Cun structures were only distorted slightly and the NCO species retained linear structure. The N-C bond-length contraction and C-O bond-length elongation were observed clearly. The reactivity enhancement of NCO species toward CO 2 was obvious. But, no reactivity enhancement of NCO to <b>form</b> <b>N</b> <b>2</b> related to the N-C bond strength could be observed.

The rapid inhibition of R. rubrum <b>N</b> <b>2</b> ase in vivo by NH 4 + was shown to result from the conversion of <b>N</b> <b>2</b> ase A to <b>N</b> <b>2</b> ase Rinactive. On depletion of NH 4 + from the culture, whole-cell <b>N</b> <b>2</b> ase activity returned; however, the enzyme remained in the R form.

Both types of true denitrifiers released NO while reducing nitrite anaerobically {{in the presence of}} the uncoupler 3 -chlorophenylhydrazonepropanedinitrile (CCCP), as seen previously only in Paracoccus denitrificons. In contrast, the pseudodenitrifier Rhizobium "hedysari" HCNT 1, which grows as neither adenitrifier nor a fermenter, failed to reduce nitrate or nitrite or to nitrify ammonia when grown aerobically but reduced nitrite to <b>N</b> <b>2</b> O after growth at low oxygen tension even without any nitrogen oxide in the culture medium.

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis the density {{functional}} B 3 LYP {{has been used}} to study reactions of NO and O 2 in redox active enzymes. Reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous oxide (<b>N</b> <b>2</b> O) is an important part in the bacterial energy conservation (denitrification). The reduction of NO in three different bimetallic active sites leads to the formation of hyponitrous acid anhydride (<b>N</b> <b>2</b> O 22 -). The stability of this intermediate is crucial for the reaction rate. In the two diiron systems, respiratory and scavenging types of NOR, it is possible to cleave the N-O bond, <b>forming</b> <b>N</b> <b>2</b> O, without any extra protons or electrons. In a heme-copper oxidase, on the other hand, both a proton and an electron are needed to <b>form</b> <b>N</b> <b>2</b> O. In addition to being an intermediate in the denitrification, NO is a toxic agent. Myoglobin in the oxy-form reacts with NO forming nitrate (NO 3 -) at a high rate, which should make this enzyme an efficient NO scavenger. Peroxynitrite (ONOO-) is formed as a short-lived intermediate and isomerizes to nitrate through a radical reaction. In the mechanism for pumping protons in cytochrome oxidase, thermodynamics, rather than structural changes, might guide protons to the heme propionate for further translocation. The dioxygenation of arachidonic acid in prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase forms the bicyclic prostaglandin G 2, through a cascade of radical reactions.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the electrochemical reduction of nitric oxide (NO) {{on a series of}} metals (Pd, Rh, Ru, Ir, and Au) has been studied, both for the reduction of adsorbed NO and for the continuous NO reduction.

The physiological significance of this Mn <b>2</b> +-dependent <b>N</b> <b>2</b> ase activating system was suggested here by observations that growth of R. rubrum and Rhodopseudomonas capsulata on <b>N</b> <b>2</b> gas (a condition that produces active <b>N</b> <b>2</b> ase R) required Mn 2 +, but growth on ammonia or glutamate did not.

Chromatium <b>N</b> <b>2</b> ase, in contrast, was always fully active and did not require Mn 2 + activation, suggesting that only the purple nonsulfur bacteria are capable of controlling their <b>N</b> <b>2</b> ase activity by this new type of regulatory system.

If p {{is of the}} form 4 Z + 1, then p is the only prime that divides successive integers of the <b>form</b> <b>n</b> <b>2</b> + K, and p divides successive pairs precisely when n is of the form bp + 2 Z, for any integer Z?. If p is of the form 4 Z + 3, then p is the largest prime that divides successive integers of the <b>form</b> <b>n</b> <b>2</b> - + (3 Z + 2), and p divides successive pairs precisely when n is of the form bp + (2 Z + 1), for any integer b. Furthermore, p {{will be the only}} prime divisor if and only if p = 3. The purpose of this note is to generalize these results to the general quadratic. Specifically, we prove the following Theorem 2 : Let p be an odd prime and define P(n) = a <b>2</b> <b>n</b> <b>2</b> + a in + a 0 * where n and all coefficients are integers and a 2 * 0. If p divides P(n) and P(n + d), where d is an integer not divisible by p, then p divides a^d 2 - a 2 + ka^a ^ and n satisfies the equation (<b>2</b> <b>n</b> + d) a 2 + ai E 0 mod p. Proof: Suppose that p divides P(n) and P(n+ d).

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>N</b> <b>2</b> H 4 decomposition on Fe, Ru, Pt and Cu surfaces was analyzed by UBI-QEP (Unity Bond Index-Quadratic Exponential Potential) method. The {{results show that}} N-N bond cleavage in <b>N</b> <b>2</b> H 4 is dominant decomposition route with the order of metal activity: Ru similar to Fe > Pt > Cu, but the product selectivity is significantly varied with metal surfaces. The main products on Fe and Ru are predicted to be H, and N- 2 which is little <b>formed</b> via species <b>N</b> <b>2</b> Hx, and the activity on Ru is higher than that on Fe, in contrast, on Pt and Cu the products are NH 3, N- 2 and H- 2, and the <b>formed</b> species <b>N</b> <b>2</b> H during decomposition could be transformed into N- 2 and H- 2, and the activity on Pt is more than that on Cu...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of nitrogen molecules <b>N</b> <b>2</b> with the host lattice of compound semiconductors is investigated using first principles density functional calculations. In ZnO {{it is found}} that <b>N</b> <b>2</b> causes localized states in the band gap either by <b>forming</b> an <b>N</b> <b>2</b> O molecule or by breaking a Zn O bond. This mechanism contributes to the observed low nitrogen doping efficiency in ZnO. The appearance of localized states caused by <b>N</b> <b>2</b> was also found in other semiconductors such as MgO and NaC...|$|R
40|$|Nonthermal plasma {{technique}} has drawn extensive attentions for removal of air pollutants such as NOx and SO 2. The NO removal mechanism in pulse discharged plasma {{is discussed in}} this paper. Emission spectra diagnosis indicates that the higher the discharge voltage is, the more the NO are removed and transformed into O, <b>N,</b> <b>N</b> <b>2,</b> NO 2, and so forth. Plasma electron temperature Te is ranged from 6400 [*]K at 2. 4 [*]kV discharge voltage to 9500 [*]K at 4. 8 [*]kV. After establishing a zero-dimensional chemical reaction kinetic model, the major reaction paths are clarified as the electron collision dissociation of NO into N and O during discharge and followed by single substitution of N on NO to <b>form</b> <b>N</b> <b>2</b> during and after discharge, compared with the small fraction of NO 2 formed by oxidizing NO. The reaction directions can be adjusted by <b>N</b> <b>2</b> additive, and the optimal <b>N</b> <b>2</b> /NO mixing ratio is 2 [*]:[*] 1. Such a ratio not only compensates the disadvantage of electron competitive consumption by the mixed <b>N</b> <b>2,</b> but also heightens the total NO removal extent through accelerating the NO oxidization process...|$|R
