40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method {{to identify the}} danger of rock burst from the response of <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> torque during <b>drilling</b> process to overcome many defects of the conventional volume of drilled coal rubble method.

In light of the analysis, a new device for testing <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> torque is developed and a series of experiments is performed under different conditions; the results show that <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> torque linearly increases with the increase of coal stress and coal strength; the faster the drilling speed, the larger the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> torque, and vice versa. When monitoring rock burst by <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> torque method, the index of rock burst is regarded as a function in which coal stress index and coal strength index are principal variables.

30|$|A {{variety of}} methods {{have been used to}} {{transmit}} signals from the ground to the equipment in the bottom hole assembly. At 90  years, some scientists have proposed to carry out underground operations by controlling the change in the rotational rate of the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe.</b> Using the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> rotation rate {{as the basis for the}} transfer command, the sensor connected to the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> can measure the rotation rate of the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe.</b> The rotation axis of the sensor is coincident with the rotation axis of the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe.</b> When the rotational speed increases, the centrifugal force increases, in the role of centrifugal force sensor in the radial extension. Whereas a decrease in the rate of rotation of the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> will cause the sensor to retract, that is, the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> rotation rate may be indirectly expressed as a radial expansion of the sensor. Using a sensor, a spring, and an excitation source, the instrument can perform command transfer based on drill string rotation rate changes. The mechanical structure of the entire sensor and excitation system is very complex and can only measure the change in the rate of rotation of the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe.</b> It cannot measure the increase in the angle of rotation of the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe.</b> This method may cause large errors in the signal transmission when the drill string is rotated at a low rate due to the centrifugal force acting on the sensor in drilling the inclined shaft.|$|R

50|$|In DTH drilling, the {{percussion}} mechanism - {{commonly called}} the hammer - is located {{directly behind the}} drill bit. The <b>drill</b> <b>pipes</b> transmit the necessary feed force and rotation to hammer and bit plus compressed air or fluids for the hammer and flushing of cuttings. The <b>drill</b> <b>pipes</b> {{are added to the}} drill string successively behind the hammer as the hole gets deeper. The piston strikes the impact surface of the bit directly, while the hammer casing gives straight and stable guidance of the drill bit. This means that the impact energy does not have to pass through any joints at all. The impact energy therefore is not lost in joints allowing for much deeper percussion drilling. This is a great breakthrough for smaller portable water well drilling rigs, that before were limited. The DTH on smaller rigs now can get same results as large heavy truck rigs.|$|E

5000|$|Studies {{done for}} the Minerals Management Service have {{questioned}} the reliability of shear rams in deep-water drilling. Figure 1 shows {{the result of a}} 2002 study on offshore oil rigs. This study was designed to answer the question “Can a given rig’s BOP equipment shear the pipe to be used in a given drilling program at the most demanding condition to be expected?” [...] Seven of the fourteen cases in this study opted not to test, another had insufficient data to draw a definitive conclusion, and three failed to shear the pipe under realistic conditions of expected well bore and seawater pressure. In each case of failure, increasing the pressure on the rams above its design value, successfully sheared the pipe.

5000|$|The {{top drive}} allows the {{drilling}} rig to drill the longer section of a stand of <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> in one operation. A rotary table type rig can only drill 30 ft (single <b>drill</b> <b>pipe)</b> sections of <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> whereas a top drive can drill 60 - 90 ft stands (double and triple <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> respectively, a triple being three joints of drillpipe screwed together), depending on {{the drilling rig}} size. Handling longer sections of <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> enables a <b>drilling</b> rig to make greater daily progress because up to 90 ft can be drilled at a time, thus requiring fewer [...] "connections" [...] to add another 30 ft of <b>drill</b> <b>pipe.</b> Another advantage of top drive systems is time efficiency. When the bit progresses under a kelly drive, the entire string must be withdrawn from the well bore {{for the length of}} the kelly in order to add one more length of <b>drill</b> <b>pipe.</b> With a top drive, the draw works only has to pick up a new stand from the rack and make up two joints. Making fewer and quicker connections reduces the risk of a stuck string from annulus clogging while drilling fluid is not being pumped.|$|R

5000|$|The {{ability to}} be cast and molded, {{combined}} with high wear resistance, has also led to Liquidmetal {{being used as a}} replacement for plastics in some applications.

Liquidmetal was used in the Biolase dental laser Ilase and the Socketmobile ring bar code scanner. Liquidmetal has also notably been used for making the SIM ejector tool of some iPhone 3Gs made by Apple Inc., shipped in the US. This was done by Apple as an exercise to test the viability of usage of the metal. They retain a scratch-free surface longer than competing materials, while still being made in complex shapes.

50|$|Oil well {{drilling}} utilises tri-cone roller, carbide embedded, fixed-cutter diamond, or diamond-impregnated drill bits {{to wear away}} at the cutting face. This is preferred {{because there is no}} need to return intact samples to surface for assay as the objective is to reach a formation containing oil or natural gas. Sizable machinery is used, enabling depths of several kilometres to be penetrated. Rotating hollow <b>drill</b> <b>pipes</b> carry down bentonite and barite infused drilling muds to lubricate, cool, and clean the drilling bit, control downhole pressures, stabilize the wall of the borehole and remove drill cuttings. The mud travels back to the surface around the outside of the drill pipe, called the annulus. Examining rock chips extracted from the mud is known as mud logging. Another form of well logging is electronic and is commonly employed to evaluate the existence of possible oil and gas deposits in the borehole. This can take place while the well is being drilled, using Measurement While Drilling tools, or after drilling, by lowering measurement tools into the newly drilled hole.|$|E
50|$|On 30 April, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce asked Halliburton {{to brief}} {{it as well}} as provide any {{documents}} it might have related to its work on the Macondo well. Attention has focused on the cementing procedure and the blowout preventer, which failed to fully engage. A number of significant problems were identified with the blowout preventer: There was a leak in the hydraulic system that provides power to the shear rams. The underwater control panel had been disconnected from the pipe ram, and instead connected to a test ram. The blowout preventer schematic drawings, provided by Transocean to BP, did not correspond to the structure that was on the ocean bottom. The shear rams were not designed to function on the joints where the <b>drill</b> <b>pipes</b> were screwed together or on tools that were passed through the blowout preventer during well construction. The explosion may have severed the communication line between the rig and the sub-surface blowout preventer control unit such that the blowout preventer would have never received the instruction to engage. Before the backup dead man's switch could engage, communications, power and hydraulic lines must all be severed, but it is possible hydraulic lines were intact after the explosion. Of the two control pods for the deadman switch, the one that was inspected had a dead battery. Employee Tyrone Benton told the BBC on 21 June that a leak was spotted on a crucial piece of equipment in the oil rig's blowout preventer weeks before the accident, and that Transocean and BP were emailed about it.|$|E

40|$|Deep {{drilling}} using a rigid drillstring {{requires the}} assembly and disassembly of multiple <b>drill</b> <b>pipes.</b> The interfaces between these pipes provide {{a challenge for}} automation because they must transmit large drilling forces and movements while, at the same time, minimise the actions and forces that are needed to make or break the interface. A geometry which can address these requirements has been suggested by the authors. This approach would use a push-and-twist bayonet system to engage <b>drill</b> <b>pipes,</b> with torque transmission through the bayonet studs. A variety of L-shaped and T-shaped bayonet paths have been proposed to ensure that separation of specific <b>drill</b> <b>pipes</b> can be achieved {{through a combination of}} clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation and single-point clamping. Sustained drills into a variety of media are used to show that percussive impulses are transmitted across the interface, whilst ensuring that the drill interface is able to withstand the shock loading associated with hammer-drilling. These tests are repeated and contrasted to control experiments using a single-piece control drillstring, which allows the performance of the interface and any degradation over time to be quantified. Results suggest that the bayonet-style connection performs well with no significant performances losses encountered or structural degradation noted...|$|E

50|$|On 23 March 2011, BOEMRE and the Coast Guard {{published}} the forensic examination report prepared by U.S. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) Columbus, the contractor that performed the examination. The report {{concluded that the}} primary cause of failure was that the blind shear rams failed to fully close and seal due to a portion of <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> trapped between the shearing blocks. This happened because the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> elastically buckled within the wellbore due to forces induced on the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> during loss of well control, consequently, <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> in process of shearing was deformed outside the shearing blade surfaces, and, consequently, the blind shearing rams were not able to move the entire pipe cross section into the shearing surfaces of the blades. Therefore, oil continued to flow through the <b>drill</b> <b>pipe</b> trapped between the ram block faces and subsequently through the gaps between the ram blocks. Since the pipe buckled when well control was lost, the blind shear rams would have failed to function as planned no matter when they were made active.|$|R
