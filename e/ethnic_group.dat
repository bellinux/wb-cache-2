40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a profile of}} the comparative economic, social and demographic characteristics of people from minority <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> living in England and Wales, mainly using data from the 2001 Census of Population.

The relative youth, geographical concentration and economic disadvantage of these <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> are presented as key characteristics for their social inclusion and social cohesion. Contrasts between <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> in demography, family composition, social structure and labour market participation are discussed, highlighting the continued disadvantage of minority <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> taken as a whole relative to white people, but also the economic progress of some <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} if Caucasians’ perceptions of other <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> were shaped by television viewing {{and lack of}} diversity in the geographical area of Idaho. Idaho is sparsely diverse, thus this study was expected to reiterate past research findings. Which indicated, that the less an individual of another ethnic culture comes into contact with other ethnicities, the more negative perceptions will be held by that individual. And although Caucasians’ perceptions were pertinent to this study other <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups,</b> participated {{as part of the}} survey. The participants included 72. 90 % Caucasians/White and 27. 10 % and four other <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups.</b> Contrary to past research, this study found no significant indication that perceptions were shaped by the media or lack of diversity in the area. However, the likely significant indicator of this lack of finding is that this study did not name specific <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> in the study questions. This author used the word “other ethnicities,” in the survey questions to avoid generalization of other <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> from the participants. It {{is interesting to note that}} the participating <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> tended to perceive other <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> as one group. This might indicate that <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> have a stronger within group mentality. Further research needs to address why such mentality is more predominant in the <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R
