40|$|AbstractBackgroundAn {{outbreak}} of Acinetobacter baumannii in neurological {{intensive care unit}} was detected, causing nosocomial infection on 6 cases and colonization on 5 cases. MethodsFive major clones of A baumannii circulating {{in the intensive care}} unit were detected by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The outbreak was controlled by aggressive intervention with <b>disinfection</b> of <b>equipments</b> and environment, and audit of hand-washing practice by the staff in this intensive care unit. ResultsThe A baumannii could be isolated from equipments and the environment, including the chart folders 5 / 8 (62. 5 %), work trolley 1 / 2 (50. 0 %), ambulance bag of patient 1 / 3 (33. 3 %), hands of healthcare-workers 7 / 22 (31. 8 %), surfaces of monitors 1 / 4 (25. 0 %), bottle of suction fluid 1 / 4 (25. 0 %); but not isolated from the hands of healthcare-workers after disinfection with wash practice. ConclusionsDifferent strains of A baumannii may cause infection, exist in medical environment, and colonize the patients at the same time. It may develop into true infection anytime. We conclude that hand hygiene as well as <b>disinfection</b> of <b>equipments</b> and the environment are the two most important factors to control and prevent the {{outbreak of}} A baumannii...|$|R

40|$|On the {{occasion}} of quality controls in food business and during official food surveillance, didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC) residues {{in excess of the}} currently applicable MRL of 0. 01 mg/kg were detected in food. DDAC is a quaternary ammonium compound belonging to the group of cationic surfactants. It is used in disinfectants and detergents. DDAC is both a biocide and a pesticide active substance. In addition, DDAC is contained in products used as plant strengtheners. The available data indicate “background” levels of DDAC above the currently applicable default MRL for most commodities. Based on the available data the cause can not always be clearly identified. It is noticed, that for citrus fruit and large tropical fruit, e. g. banana and mango, occasionally especially high residues were reported. It is likely that these fruits received post-harvest treatments with DDAC. Very high residues were also observed for fresh herbs. These residues can be the result of the use of a plant strengthener, which has meanwhile been withdrawn from the market. Disinfection of planting pots or equipment might also have been a source. DDAC residues in milk and ice cream might be due to <b>disinfection</b> of <b>equipment.</b> Based on German and EU consumption data, the BfR estimated the dietary intake of DDAC residues from contaminated food. Neither the ARfD nor the ADI are exceeded. The BfR comes to the conclusion that neither an acute nor a chronic risk for consumers is likely. The BfR considers it as reasonable to raise the MRLs for DDAC to an adequate extent, if the changes are reviewed as soon as more information becomes available from national product authorizations for biocides containing DDAC. Furthermore it is recommended to establish clear guidance on adequate cleaning/washing procedures to be followed after <b>disinfection</b> of <b>equipment</b> that gets in contact with food...|$|R

Methods: A various range of the on-site medical waste <b>disinfection</b> <b>equipment</b> (autoclave, chemical disinfection, hydroclave, and dry thermal treatment) was considered to select 10 out of 22 hospitals in Tabriz to be included in the survey. The apparatus were monitored mechanically, chemically, and biologically for a six months period in all of the selected hospitals. Results: The results of the chemical monitoring (Bowie-Dick tests) indicated that 38. 9 % of the inspected autoclaves had operational problems in pre-vacuum, air leaks, inadequate steam penetration into the waste, and/or vacuum pump. The biological indicators revealed that about 55. 55 % of the samples were positive. The most of applied devices were not suitable for treating anatomical, pharmaceutical, cytotoxic, and chemical waste. Conclusion: Although on-site medical waste treating facilities have been installed in all the hospitals, the most of infectious-hazardous medical waste generated in the hospitals were deposited into a municipal solid waste landfill, without enough disinfection. The responsible authorities should stringently inspect and evaluate the operation of on-site medical waste treating equipment.

40|$|Hypochlorite {{has been}} used as a {{disinfectant}} for more than 100 years. It has many of the properties of an ideal disinfectant, including a broad antimicrobial activity, rapid bactericidal action, reasonable persistence in treated potable water, ease of use, solubility in water, relative stability, relative nontoxicity at use concentrations, no poisonous residuals, no color, no staining, and low cost. The active species is undissociated hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Hypochlorites are lethal to most microbes, although viruses and vegetative bacteria are more susceptible than endospore-forming bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. Activity is reduced by the presence of heavy metal ions, a biofilm, organic material, low temperature, low pH, or UV radiation. Clinical uses in health-care facilities include hyperchlorination of potable water to prevent Legionella colonization, chlorination of water distribution systems used in hemodialysis centers, cleaning of environmental surfaces, disinfection of laundry, local use to decontaminate blood spills, <b>disinfection</b> of <b>equipment,</b> decontamination of medical waste prior to disposal, and dental therapy.

40|$|Drinking {{water is}} {{disinfected}} to inactivate waterborne pathogens. The {{most common form}} of disinfection is chlorination, although ozone and UV light are also used in some plants of the world. <b>Disinfection</b> <b>equipment</b> depends on the type of disinfectant used. In developing countries, the water disinfection problem is large and complex. There are a number of appropriate methods but chlorine continues {{to be one of the}} most popular options. In Algeria, it is the only method of disinfection used. Chlorine is a very effective disinfectant, it is relatively easy to handle, the capital costs of chlorine installation are low, simple to dose, measure and control and it has a relatively good residual effect. Chlorination efficiency depends on chlorine residual, contact time, type of chemical used, location in the treatment process, and on characteristics of the water being treated. The chlorine demand involves the reaction of chlorine with compounds in water, reducing the amount of chlorine available to kill microorganisms. Chlorination of humic substances in drinking water is known to produce mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds such as trihalomethanes. Because of their chemical quality, Algerian waters could lead to complex and competitive reactions during chlorination step. The widespread detection of chloroform and other organohalogenated compounds contamination in the water reservoirs appear to be largely a consequence of the use of chlorination for the disinfection of drinking water. Those documented as probable human carcinogens and mutagens have been detected in large amounts and have been considered as the major component of DBPs. Taking into account above drawn conclusions, greater efforts are needed to evaluate and set priorities for drinking water disinfection in Algeria. The challenge is to maintain the level of microbial protection while minimizing the exposure of the consumers to DBPs. I...|$|E

It {{is one of the}} most common causes of reported food-borne diseases in the United States. Although several Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) have been identified, SEA, a highly heat-stable SE, is the most common cause of SFD worldwide. Outbreak investigations have found that improper food handling practices in the retail industry account for the majority of SFD outbreaks. However, several studies have documented prevalence of S. aureus in many food products including raw retail meat indicating that consumers are at potential risk of S. aureus colonization and subsequent infection. Presence of pathogens in food products imposes potential hazard for consumers and causes grave economic loss and loss in human productivity via food-borne disease. Symptoms of SFD include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps with or without diarrhea.

40|$|Abstract A survey {{involving}} 181 {{water treatment}} plants across 7 provinces of South Africa: Mpumalanga, Limpopo, North West, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Western Cape was undertaken {{to identify the}} challenges facing small water treatment plants (SWTPs) in South Africa. Information gathered included ownership and design capacity of the plants, water sources, and various methods of <b>disinfection,</b> <b>equipment</b> currently employed and performance of the treatment plants. In general, the majority (over 80 %) of the SWTPs surveyed in the designated provinces were owned by the district municipalities. The designed capacities of these plants varied between 1 and 60 Mℓ/d; the smallest capacity was 100 m 3 /d and the largest 120 Mℓ/d. The small water treatment plants abstracted their raw water from either surface or groundwater {{or a combination of}} both water sources with greater preponderance for surface water sources (over 86 %). Water treatment practices were noted to be the conventional types mainly coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection. Two types of coagulants namely polyelectrolyte (66 %) and alum (18 %) were commonly used by the water treatment plants across the provinces studied. Rapid gravity filtration, pressure filter and slow sand filtration systems accounted for 60 %, 23 % and 9 % of the filtration systems across the provinces, respectively. The predominant types of disinfectants employed were chlorine gas (69 %) followed by sodium (15 %) and calcium (14 %) hypochlorite. Over 50 % of the various SWTPs did not comply with the SANS 241 Class I (< 1 NTU) and Class II (1 to 5 NTU) recommended turbidity values. The recommended target range of 0. 3 to 0. 6 mg/ℓ free chlorine residual concentrations at the point of use was not always met by 40 % of the plants. Seventy percent of the SWTPs complied with the SANS 241 criteria of microbiological safety of drinking water vis-à-vis total and faecal coliforms. Operational problems affecting the efficiency of small water treatment plants included: inability to appropriately determine the flow rate, chemical dosage and turbidity, lack of chlorine residual at the point of use and lack of water quality monitoring. To produce safe drinking water, appropriate operational practices must be implemented in all small water treatment plants...|$|E

The case study is based on the social problem of an rising unemployment while outsourcing is becoming increasingly popular for manufacturing companies in Sweden. The case company is a medical technology company that manufactures supplies articles to <b>disinfection</b> <b>equipment.</b> The case study brings up opinions about what is essential to study in a manufacturing company when a long-term decision on flow efficiency is to be taken. The study aims to create an understanding of how an internal production flow in a manufacturing company can achieve high efficiency. Estimation is to be created on how the actual internal production flow is different in relation to the flow that occurs when processes are transferred externally. The determining between producing internally or removing parts of production must include an review of the factors that affect the company's profitability. Initially it is essential for manufacturing companies to evaluate their current situation carefully to develop in the right direction in the future. A disposition model is presented after the theory chapter to structure the work and give the reader {{a clear view of the}} coming parts in the case study. At first the current situation of the case company is studied. After that the empirical data linked with the relevant theory becomes an analysis of the current state.

Finally the comparison is evaluated and the factors that have the greatest impact on the company's decision making are clarified. The result that the case study has generated is that the essential factors affect each other and that a business should focus on reviewing the factors together, to achieve a desired production flow efficiency. The reviewing of factors generates a support if outsourcing should be applied in a future corporate development. It also shows how the employees of the company are affected by this choice...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the latest developments in closed soilless growing systems in the Netherlands, where growers are obliged to invest in environmently friendly cropping systems, in order to comply with new legislation. Subjects of discussion will be the reasons for regulation, the growers' reaction to the proposed legislation, the methods to comply with legislation and related problems such as the availability of good water, the systems applied and the developments in the disinfection of nutrient solutions. For the latter, the interest of growers in the possibilities of slow sand filtration to disinfect the nutrient solution will be mentioned. In the last ten years there has been an awakening of environmental consciousness in society. Agriculture and horticulture have had to face their polluting aspects, too, such as the leaching of nutrients, the emission of pesticides and the waste of materials such as plastics and substrates. Initial legislation was rather rough (“all growers should change to closed systems”) and not based on research. Later, forced by court judgements and social pressure, new regulations (the Waste Water Disposal Decree) have set a timetable for all nurseries to adopt specific measures in order to decrease the leaching of water and fertilizers to the environment. The recirculation of drain water and the collecting of rainwater have become compulsory for substrate growers. On the other hand, recirculation via the soil and the traditional drainage system has been approved as a “closed” substrate system. For soil-bound crops, maximum water supply and collecting rainwater will be compulsory. In the last few years, low market prices have shown very clearly which closed systems were profitable and which were not. As a consequence, a discussion arose about the benefits for the environment of the new regulations and the costs for the growers. There were few new developments in growing systems, as the growers' first point of attention was economic survival. This year, 1996, prices have been better and the growers are again looking for possibilities {{to improve the quality of}} their systems. In the Netherlands, it has always been said that disinfection of the recirculating nutrient solution is a must for long-term crops to avoid a disaster due to an outbreak of root diseases. However, existing sterilizing systems are not always applied, mainly because of the high costs. Now, developments in <b>disinfection</b> <b>equipment</b> focus on the removal of pathogens without a complete sterilization of the nutrient solution. Investigations of the prospects of slow sand filtration as a cheap, robust disinfection method have proved its feasibility only on a small scale. Now, it can be seen that the development and application of closed soilless growing systems is approaching maturity in the Netherlands. On the other hand, developments i...|$|E

Šio darbo tikslas – įvertinti elektrochemiškai aktyvuoto tirpalo – neutralaus anolito ANK – dezinfekuojamąsias savybes laboratorinėmis ir gamybinėmis sąlygomis sanitariškai apdorojant melžimo įrenginius. Įvertinus įrenginyje STEL- 10 N- 120 - 01 pagamintą 0, 05 proc. koncentracijos neutralų anolitą (ANK) nustatyta, kad šis tirpalas slopino Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Salmonella {{enteritis}} ir Klebsiella bakterijų augimą. Melžimo įrenginius dezinfekuojant ir neutraliu anolitu (ANK), ir šarminiu tirpalu prieš praplaunant vandeniu, mikroorganizmai neaugo. Praplovus vandeniu pieno kolboje ir kolektoriuje mikroorganizmų rasta (p > 0, 05). Po plovimo vandeniu naudojant anolitą (ANK), inhibitorinių medžiagų vandenyje nenustatyta, o naudojant šarminį tirpalą – nustatyta. Melžimo įrenginius galime dezinfekuoti anolitu (ANK), tik labai svarbu, kad naudojamas vanduo atitiktų Geriamo vandens higienos norma.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{study was}} made to {{determine}} the fate of Samonella organisms after in-gestion by the laying hen. Three species of Salmonella were used, i. e., senftenberg, thompson and typhimurium. Approximately one million cells of each species were introduced into the crop of 12 White Leghorn type laying hens for 10 days. The trials involving each species were carried out consecutively with thorough <b>disinfection</b> of <b>equipment</b> between trials. From each hen, feces and eggs were analyzed daily for Salmonella for the 10 day period. At {{the end of the}} 10 day trial a sample of blood was drawn from each hen for Salmonella analysis. In addition, the hens were slaughtered and a sample of the ovaries, kidneys, heart, liver and lungs was aseptically removed for analysis. Results showed that approximately 25 % of the fecal samples were found to contain the species of Salmonella under study. The percentage of positive recoveries from egg shells was less than 10 % for all three species studied. Among the egg contents examined for all three species, only one egg yielded a positive recovery. All tissue samples were found to be negative. It was concluded that there was no contamination of body tissues even after con-tinuous ingestion of large doses of Salmonella organisms. Neither was there a problem of egg meat contamination among intact eggs...|$|R
