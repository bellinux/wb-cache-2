5|$|After the World Security Council members {{arrive for}} the Helicarriers' launch, Rogers {{broadcasts}} Hydra's plot to {{everyone at the}} Triskelion. Romanoff, disguised {{as one of the}} Council members, disarms Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D's database so that Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Following a struggle, Fury kills Pierce. Meanwhile, Rogers and Wilson storm two Helicarriers and replace the controller chips, but the Winter Soldier destroys Wilson's suit and fights Rogers on the third. Rogers fends <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> replaces the final chip, allowing Hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other.

The Winter Soldier rescues the unconscious Rogers before disappearing into the woods.

5|$|Desmond Jennings {{opened the}} first inning with a single, but was thrown out at second base trying to stretch the hit into a double. Wil Myers then walked, {{advanced}} to third base on singles by Ben Zobrist and Evan Longoria, and finally scored on a sacrifice fly by Delmon Young. Rays starter David Price struck out leadoff batter Ian Kinsler, then allowed a walk to Elvis Andrus but picked <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> finished the inning by retiring Alex Ríos. The score remained 1–0 until {{the top of the}} third inning, when Jennings drew a walk and scored on a home run by Longoria to give the Rays a 3–0 lead. The Rangers struck right back in the bottom half, as Craig Gentry led off the inning with a single. After advancing to second on a Leonys Martín groundout, he scored on a single to right field by Kinsler. The Rays scored again in the sixth, as Longoria doubled to lead off the inning, and advanced to third base on a groundout by Young. The next batter, David DeJesus, hit a double to right field that scored Longoria and put the Rays ahead, 4–1.

5|$|Dr. Caligari is not {{the only}} symbol of arrogant {{authority}} in the film. In fact, he is a victim of harsh authority himself during the scene with the dismissive town clerk, who brushes <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> ignores him to focus on his paperwork. Film historian Thomas Elsaesser argues that Dr. Caligari's murderous rampage through Cesare {{can be seen as a}} rebellious, anti-authoritarian streak in response to such experiences as these, even in spite of his own authoritarianism. The Expressionistic set design in this scene further amplifies the power of the official and the weakness of his supplicant; the clerk towers in an excessively high chair over the small and humiliated Dr. Caligari. The scene represents class and status differences, and conveys the psychological experience of being simultaneously outraged and powerless in the face of a petty bureaucracy. Another common visual motif is the use of stairways to illustrate the hierarchy of authority figures, such as the multiple stairs leading up to police headquarters, and three staircases ascending to Dr. Caligari in the asylum.|$|E
5|$|He {{makes it}} to her in time and administers the {{antidote}} before the infection can take hold. Bennett then contacts him and Hansen makes him promise that if he gives Bennett the research, Bennett will save Anna. He soon discovers that Kamsky infected himself with a strain of exocel DNA, and now wishes {{to do the same}} to Anna. Hansen finds Kamsky's laptop and transmits the antidote data to Bennett, but nothing else. As a furious Bennett berates Hansen, he and Anna agree to blow up the rig using C4. As Hansen plants the charges, he learns Kamsky had gone completely insane; after infecting himself with exocel serum, he released the imprisoned exos on the rig and planted a group of exocels on the Eastern Spirit. He then went into hiding to await his metamorphosis. When Hansen has planted all of the charges, he heads to the heliport to meet Anna. Before they can take off however, they are attacked by a mutated Kamsky; the same creature who rescued Anna from the sea. Kamsky is desperate for Anna to remain with him on the rig, but Hansen is able to fight <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> kill him. He and Anna then escape in a helicopter as the rig explodes below them.|$|E
5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E

5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} A.J. Styles against Christopher Daniels in a Thirty-Minute Iron Man match. In an Iron Man match, a {{time-limit}} {{is set for}} a particular amount, in this case thirty-minutes. The match will continue until time runs out and the competitor who gained the most falls when time runs out by pinfall, submission, count-out, or disqualification is the overall winner of the bout. Daniels attempted to get Styles to submit early in the bout by using his Koji Clutch submission hold. Later on, Daniels earned a two-count after landing on Styles with his signature B.M.E. aerial maneuver. Styles also gained a near-fall by holding Daniels on his shoulders before twisting <b>him</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> slamming him to the mat {{for what he calls}} a Rack Bomb. With only 13 seconds left in the match and the score still tied zero to zero, Styles performed his signature Styles Clash maneuver and followed with the pin. As time ran out, Styles had the most falls thus retaining the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
