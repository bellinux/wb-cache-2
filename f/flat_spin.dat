5|$|Kraken Unleashed (named for {{the fictional}} sea monster {{of the same}} name) is a steel floorless roller coaster located at SeaWorld Orlando in the United States. Manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard, the ride {{features}} a total of seven inversions including two vertical loops, a dive loop, a spiraling camelback (zero-g roll), a cobra roll and a <b>flat</b> <b>spin</b> Kraken opened on June 1, 2000. It is also the world's second longest floorless coaster elongating up to 4,177 feet (1,273 m). The coaster was refurbished and renamed to Kraken Unleashed. The refurbishment included Virtual Reality.|$|E
5|$|To the {{attacker}}s' surprise, Voss {{did not try}} {{to escape}} the aerial trap. Instead, he flicked his triplane about in a <b>flat</b> <b>spin</b> and fired at his attackers in a headon firing pass, holing McCudden's wings. Voss riddled Cronyn's SE.5 from close range, putting him out of the dogfight. Cronyn had to turn in under his attacker and throw his aircraft into a spin to escape being killed. His wingmates attacked Voss while Cronyn also limped for home.|$|E
5|$|On 11 April 1939 he {{narrowly}} {{escaped with}} his life alongside Geoffrey de Havilland; both men parachuting to safety. They had taken a Moth Minor into the air to test its response to spins. The prototypes had an anti-spin parachute but preceding tests had been carried out without the need to resort to the safety measure. Geoffrey put the aircraft into a left-hand spin which was recovered. Climbing back to 8,000 feet the aircraft was put into it a right-hand spin. The engine cut out, the nose reared-up and the aircraft stalled and entered a <b>flat</b> <b>spin.</b> Geoffrey asked John through the Gosport tube to try to escape their perilous situation after the controls proved non-responsive to de Havilland's efforts. Both decided to parachute out. Upon doing so the Moth declined its nose and recovered from the spin. The engine ignition had been left on and the wind-milling propeller started the engine. The aircraft began circling the descending airmen at dangerously close range. Fortunately it descended {{at a faster rate}} and was destroyed when it hit the ground. Cunningham casually took pictures of the wreckage and his parachute which exemplified his cool nature.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the center}} of gravity often being further back on the {{longitudinal}} axis than on most tractor airplanes, pushers can be more prone to <b>flat</b> <b>spins,</b> especially if loaded improperly.|$|R
40|$|A spin tunnel {{study is}} {{reported}} on a scale model of a research airplane typical of low-wing, single-engine, light general aviation airplanes to determine the tail parachute diameter and canopy distance (riser length plus suspension-line length) required for energency spin recovery. Nine tail configurations were tested, resulting {{in a wide range}} of developed spin conditions, including steep <b>spins</b> and <b>flat</b> <b>spins.</b> The results indicate that the full-scale parachute diameter required for satisfactory recovery from the most critical conditions investigated is about 3. 2 m and that the canopy distance, which was found to be critical for <b>flat</b> <b>spins,</b> should be between 4. 6 and 6. 1 m...|$|R
50|$|In 1999 airshow {{performer}} Wayne Handley {{broke the}} world record for the most consecutive <b>flat</b> <b>spins</b> in a Giles G-202 performing 78 spins. The record was broken in 2014 by Spencer Suderman in 2014 in a Pitts S2-B performing 81 spins from 23,000 ft altitude.|$|R

25|$|At {{approximately}} 5:15p.m., at {{an altitude}} of approximately , Flight 28 was struck by the B-34. The DC-3 lost its rudder to the propeller from the B-34's right engine, along with portions of its tail. It fell from the sky in a <b>flat</b> <b>spin</b> and impacted a rocky ledge in Chino Canyon, below San Jacinto Peak, before crashing into the desert and exploding.|$|E
25|$|On 21 October 1954, a pilot {{attached}} to Gloster from RAE Farnborough was killed while flying Javelin XA546 after having entered {{what appeared to}} be an intentional spin. On 8 December 1955, a service test pilot S/L Dick was testing XA561 for the A when the aircraft entered a <b>flat</b> <b>spin</b> during manoeuvres, which the anti-spin parachute could not stop, and he ejected. Following this, a stall-warning device was developed for the Javelin.|$|E
50|$|The R.31 entered {{service with}} the Belgian Air Force in 1935, {{replacing}} the Breguet 19 in the 9e and 11e Escadrilles d'Observation based at Liège. In service, {{it was not}} popular, as it had poor handling, being vulnerable to entering <b>flat</b> <b>spins</b> if mishandled, with all aerobatics therefore being banned.|$|R
50|$|A typical {{counter of}} presorted coins uses {{a bowl with}} <b>flat</b> <b>spinning</b> disc at the bottom to {{distribute}} coins around the bowl perimeter. An opening in {{the edge of the}} bowl is only wide enough to accept one coin at a time. Coins either pass through a light-beam counter, or are pushed through a spring-loaded cam that only accepts one coin at a time.|$|R
50|$|These {{elements}} {{allow for}} spectacular aerobatics such as hovering, 'harriers', torque rolling, blenders, rolling circles, <b>flat</b> <b>spins,</b> and more; maneuvers that are performed below the stall {{speed of the}} model. The type of flying could {{be referred to as}} 'on the prop' as opposed to 'on the wing', which would describe more conventional flight patterns that make more use of the lifting surfaces of the plane.|$|R
25|$|On a ride {{during the}} winter of 1931 her plane was in a <b>flat</b> <b>spin</b> and would have crashed. She climbed out of the cockpit {{preparing}} to parachute but her weight on the wing tilted the aircraft enough to take her out of the spin. She climbed back into the cockpit and regained control at 200 feet. This got her a job at Viking as a spokeswoman. In 1931 she also received her transport license.|$|E
25|$|A refined {{version of}} the FVA-1 was {{produced}} as the FVA-2 Blaue Maus (Blue Mouse). This aircraft followed the arrangement and construction of the FVA-1, with a lower seating position to reduce drag, increased span/area to reduce wing loading and reduced empty weight. Several were produced to order {{and at least one}} of these aircraft was fitted with a wheeled undercarriage replacing the main skids and one other was used by Wolfgang Klemperer to research glider launching from balloons. The attempt was unsuccessful as the aircraft entered a <b>flat</b> <b>spin</b> and did not recover before hitting the ground.|$|E
25|$|At {{the moment}} the {{stabilizer}} separated from the aircraft, the plane pitched downwards, headed straight for Belle Harbor. As the pilots struggled to control the aircraft, it went into a <b>flat</b> <b>spin.</b> The resulting aerodynamic loads sheared both engines from the aircraft seconds before impact. The engines landed several blocks north and east of the main wreckage site. Losing the engines cut off power to the FDR at 9:16:00, while the CVR (cockpit voice recorder), utilizing a battery backup, cut off at 9:16:15 moments before impact with the ground. The main impact location was the intersection of Newport Avenue and Beach 131st Street.|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{general aviation}} stall/spin research program is underway at the NASA Langley Research Center. Flight tests {{have examined the}} effects of tail design, wing leading edge design, mass distribution, and minor airframe modifications on spin and recovery characteristics. Results and observations on test techniques are presented for the first airplane in the program. Configuration changes produced spins varying from easily recoverable slow, steep spins to unrecoverable, fast <b>flat</b> <b>spins...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{configuration}} and {{positioning of}} the fins and bindings vary according to rider preference and are adjusted {{for a variety of}} reasons. A wakeboarder will change the type of fins used for different types of tricks. For example, shallow fins (which do not protrude into the water very far) are better for surface tricks, such as <b>flat</b> <b>spins.</b> Many newer board models contain small moulded fins on the board, allowing the rider to use smaller centre fins and also to create less drag.|$|R
5000|$|The {{corkscrew}} was {{the first}} modern-day inversion element to be featured on a roller coaster. It debuted {{with the release of}} Corkscrew, a roller coaster designed by Arrow Dynamics that opened in 1975 at Knott's Berry Farm. Due to its success, the element became a staple of many steel, inverting roller coasters for more than a decade. A variation of the element was created by Bolliger & Mabillard, which the company refers to as a [...] "flat spin". <b>Flat</b> <b>spins</b> snap riders quickly through the inversion at varying speeds, whereas a typical corkscrew element rotates riders at a slower, constant speed.|$|R
25|$|Deliveries to {{operational}} units began in August 1917. Jasta 10 {{was the first}} recipient of the new aircraft, followed by Jasta 4. While markedly better than the earlier Roland designs, the D.III was generally considered inferior to the Albatros D.III and D.V. German pilots variously criticized the Pfalz’s heavy controls, low speed, lack of power, or low rate of climb compared to the Albatros. The D.III slipped in turns, leading to crashes when unwary pilots turned at very low altitudes. Moreover, the Pfalz stalled sharply and spun readily. Recovery from the resulting <b>flat</b> <b>spin</b> was difficult, though some pilots took advantage of this trait to descend quickly or evade enemy aircraft.|$|E
25|$|By September 1937, {{all eight}} Gladiator squadrons had {{achieved}} operational status and had formed the spearhead of London's air defences. Difficulties with introducing the type had been experienced. Although the Gladiator was typically well liked by pilots, the accident rate encountered during operational {{training for the}} type were so numerous that a small replacement batch of 28 Gladiator Mk IIs was hurriedly produced. Most accidents were caused by pilots being caught out by the fighter’s increased wing loading and many aviators had little experience in landing aircraft with such a wide flap area. The aircraft {{had a tendency to}} stall more abruptly, frequently dropping a wing while doing so. The Gladiator proved even easier to enter a <b>flat</b> <b>spin</b> with and great skill was needed to recover.|$|E
25|$|Only two {{examples}} of the two-seater were built, but Nieuport-Delage entered the single-seater in the 1925 concours des monoplaces, a competition by the Army's Technical Service to find a replacement for the NiD 29. The NiD 42 was selected from a field of eleven competitors, and an order for 50 aircraft was placed, of which 25 were eventually delivered. Although impressive {{at the time it}} was designed, technology had already surpassed the NiD 42 when it entered service in 1928, particularly with regard to its wooden structure, and most of the development work associated with the design was made in an effort to cure it of a tendency to enter a <b>flat</b> <b>spin.</b> Nevertheless, it provided the foundation for further development as the NiD 52 and NiD 62.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flat</b> spinA <b>spin</b> induced {{with full}} up elevator, full rudder, and full aileron. Once the spin is {{initiated}} you will level the ailerons and increase engine speed {{a bit to}} pull the aircraft around. This will in turn flatten the spin.|$|R

50|$|Thus tennis shots can be {{categorized}} according to when they are hit (serve, groundstroke, volley, half volley), how they are hit (smash, forehand, backhand, <b>flat,</b> side <b>spin,</b> block, slice, topspin shot), or where they are hit (lob, passing shot, dropshot, cross-court shot, down-the-line shot).|$|R
25|$|The few Re.2000 and 2000GA {{were used}} over Mediterranean Sea as escort and attack aircraft, {{sometimes}} with Macchi 200/202s and C.R.20 two-engine fighters. 377a {{was based in}} Sicily, and fought in Malta and Pantelleria, mainly in an escort role and protecting Axis ships almost until Tunisia (with a range up to 300–350km), well beyond the other RA single seat-fighters; sometimes {{it was used to}} attack Malta with bomblets (spezzoni) and machine guns, typically at dawn. It reported a single 'kill' against a Bristol Blenheim. Overall, their service was not remarkable: there was at least one sudden fatal <b>flat</b> <b>spin,</b> while another Re.2000 had fatal engine damage (a piston was literally driven through the cylinder) and crash-landed, overturning, catching fire and almost killing its pilot (rescued by the ground crew). Although the Reggiane had a long range, it was disliked and even feared by ground crew and pilots, for its difficult maintenance and unpredictable engine reliability and handling. The last Re.2000 was sent back to the factory in September 1942.|$|E
25|$|Deliveries of {{production}} P-63As began in October 1943. The USAAF concluded the Kingcobra was {{inferior to the}} Mustang, and declined to order larger quantities. American allies, particularly the Soviet Union, had a great need for fighter aircraft, however, and the Soviets were already the largest users of the Airacobra. Therefore, the Kingcobra was ordered into production to be delivered under Lend-Lease. In February 1944, the Soviet government sent a highly experienced test pilot, Andrey G. Kochetkov, and an aviation engineer, Fyodor P. Suprun, to the Bell factories {{to participate in the}} development of the first production variant, the P-63A. Initially ignored by Bell engineers, Kochetkov's expert testing of the machine's spin characteristics (which led to airframe buckling) eventually led to a significant Soviet role in the development. After <b>flat</b> <b>spin</b> recovery proved impossible, and upon Kochetkov's making a final recommendation that pilots should bail out upon entering such a spin, he received a commendation from the Irving Parachute Company. The Kingcobra’s maximum aft CG was moved forward to facilitate recovery from spins.|$|E

40|$|A {{low-speed}} {{investigation was}} conducted to determine the dynamic stability derivatives in pitch, roll, and yaw over an angle-of-attack range of - 10 [degree] to 110 [degree] for a twin-jet swept-wing fighter model.

The effect of the vertical and horizontal tail, and horizontal-tail incidence on the derivatives was also evaluated. The results indicate that the model exhibited stable values of damping in pitch over the entire angle-of-attack range, but marked reductions of damping in roll were measured at the stall, and unstable values of damping in yaw were present for the very high angles of attack associated with <b>flat</b> <b>spins.</b> Either removal of the horizontal or vertical tail or full up deflection of the horizontal tail eliminated the unstable characteristics of the damping-in-yaw derivatives.
