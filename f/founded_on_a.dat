5|$|The {{historical}} Mixco Viejo {{has been}} identified as Chinautla Viejo ("Old Chinautla"), near the modern town of Mixco. Mixco Viejo ("Old Mixco") was the capital of the Poqomam Maya kingdom, and was <b>founded</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> defensive mountain-top location in the 12th century AD. The peak population in the early 16th century may have been around 10,000 people.|$|E
5|$|The Historian was {{the first}} debut novel to land at number one on The New York Times bestseller list in its first week on sale, and as of 2005 was the fastest-selling {{hardback}} debut novel in U.S. history. The book sold more copies on its first day in print than The Da Vinci Code– 70,000 copies were sold {{in the first week}} alone. As of the middle of August 2005, the novel had already sold 915,000 copies in the U.S. and had gone through six printings. (For comparison, according to Publishers Weekly, only ten fiction books sold more than 800,000 hardcover copies in the US in 2004.) Little, Brown and Company also released an edition of Dracula in September 2005 with an introduction by Kostova, thinking her readers would want to delve into the original novel after reading hers. Kostova {{is one of the few}} female bestselling authors, but her popularity is unusual because it is <b>founded</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> literary novel.|$|E

25|$|Adelaide was <b>founded</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{vision of}} {{religious}} tolerance which attracted {{a wide variety}} of religious practitioners. This led to it being known as The City of Churches. However, approximately 28% of the population expressed no religious affiliation in the 2011 Census, compared with the national average of 22.3%, making Adelaide one of the least religious cities in Australia.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} Poole, {{a town in}} Dorset, England, {{can be traced back}} to the {{founding}} of a settlement around Poole Harbour during the Iron Age.

Poole experienced rapid growth as it became an important port following the Norman Conquest of England.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{kinds of}} site {{amplification}} of ground motion {{were observed in}} the Loma Prieta earthquake in October 1989. Deep clay deposits underlying sites {{around the perimeter of}} the San Francisco Bay area amplified the ground motion tremendously in the San Francisco and Oakland area causing severe damage. The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, <b>founded</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> deep clay site, was extensively damaged in this earthquake.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of Dorridge is strongly {{linked to the}} Muntz family, who lived in nearby Umberslade Hall. The Muntz family were descendants of Philip Fredrick Muntz, an immigrant of the 18th century, who had left revolutionary France after settling there from Poland. Through industrial wealth, <b>founded</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> brass-making process for creating Muntz Metal, a form of brass used in shipbuilding, the family acquired a considerable estate in the area.|$|E

25|$|It {{is thought}} by some that Hendon Wood Lane was {{originally}} a minor Roman road. Certainly the name, 'Grendel's Gate' (now Barnet Gate, and formally known as 'Grims Gate'), {{is associated with}} the monster from the Saxon epic, Beowulf. This implies that the place was of modest importance as early as 1005. It may have been a centre of a small but significant community, <b>founded</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> woodland economy.|$|E
25|$|Some {{have argued}} that Christianity is not <b>founded</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{historical}} Jesus, but rather on a mythical creation. This view proposes {{that the idea of}} Jesus was the Jewish manifestation of Hellenistic mystery cults that acknowledged the non-historic nature of their deity using it instead as a teaching device.However, the position that Jesus was not a historical figure is essentially without support among biblical scholars and classical historians, most of whom regard its arguments as examples of pseudo-scholarship.|$|E
25|$|Alexander the Great {{attacked}} the Getae in BC 335 {{on the lower}} Danube, but by BC 300 they had formed a state <b>founded</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> military democracy, and began a period of conquest. More Celts arrived during the BC 3rd century, and in BC 1st century the people of Boii tried to conquer some of the Dacian territory {{on the eastern side}} of the Teiss river. The Dacians drove the Boii south across the Danube and out of their territory, at which point the Boii abandoned any further plans for invasion.|$|E

25|$|Poena Damni is {{the most}} widely and best {{reviewed}} work of contemporary Greek literature in translation. Its various editions have received more than 50 international reviews until autumn 2017. The trilogy has also {{given rise to a}} considerable amount of scholarly criticism. It has been acclaimed for creatively surpassing the distinction between modernism and postmodernism while firmly <b>founded</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> large variety of canonical texts of Western Literature. Most critics comment on the use of an intricate network of textual references and paraphrases of classical and biblical works, noting, at the same time, the work's unique style and character.|$|E
25|$|AAST was <b>founded</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{charter school}} {{framework}} in 1992 {{with the mission}} of preparing students for careers {{in math and science}} by promoting a problem-solving, project-based, technical learning environment. AAST has departed from this model and has since become a more standard magnet school. The roots of the program can be seen in its unique science curriculum, which emphasizes and integrates chemistry, biology, and physics, and its hallmark Wednesday lab rotation for the first two years. This academy celebrated ten years of excellence in 2006-07. Much of the AAST model, including the 6-mod project period on Wednesday, has been adopted by the other academies.|$|E
25|$|Montevideo was <b>founded</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{promontory}} {{beside a}} large bay that forms a perfect natural harbor. In the 19th century, the British promoted it as a rival port to Buenos Aires. The city {{has expanded to}} such an extent that by 1990 it covered most of the department. The original area of settlement, known as the Old City, lies adjacent to the port, but the central business district and the middle-class residential areas have moved eastward. The only exception to this pattern of eastward expansion is that banking and finance continued to cluster in the Old City around the Stock Exchange, the Bank of Uruguay (Banco de la República Oriental del Uruguay—BROU), and the Central Bank of Uruguay.|$|E

25|$|Held {{that the}} Constitution of India which is {{essentially}} a social rather than a political document, is <b>founded</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> social philosophy and as such has two main features basic and circumstantial. The basic constituent remained constant, the circumstantial was subject to change. According to the learned Judges, the broad contours of the basic elements and the fundamental features of the Constitution are delineated in the preamble and the Parliament has no power to abolish or emasculate those basic elements of fundamental features. The building of a welfare State is {{the ultimate goal of}} every Government {{but that does not mean}} that in order to build a welfare State, human freedoms have to suffer a total destruction. Applying these tests, the learned Judges invalidated Article 31C even in its un-amended form.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{other cities}} in Colombia such as Cartagena or Bogotá D.C., Barranquilla was not founded during the Spanish colonial period {{and it was not}} <b>founded</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pre-Columbian site. The first mention of the current {{territory}} of Barranquilla dates back to 1533 and was written by Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés. He describes the route of Pedro de Heredia, founder of Cartagena, just weeks before he founded that city, and says that this was a point of landing of canoes for the Indians of Santa Marta within the interior. They had two canoes full of dried shrimp as merchandise and went to the Magdalena River to trade with this commodity, salt and other things. However, the Kamash Indians were known to occupy the area and the settlement itself was established in about 1629. For this reason the city does not celebrate its foundation, but rather the date in which it was declared a town on April 7, 1813.|$|E
25|$|Although not {{experiencing}} clashes {{comparable to}} those in Paris, the city was quickly paralysed. The absence of household waste collection gave the streets a foul odour, and the department was short of petrol from 22 May. Against this movement of left, the extreme right was not absent: While militants had thrown an explosive device in protest at the Communist permanence of the city on 23 December 1967, members of Occident opposed students on 21 May, {{in front of the}} Picardy cinema. During the night of 27–28 May, students tried to take the House of Culture. In the aftermath of President Charles de Gaulle's radio address, his supporters in Amiens demonstrated in the streets on 31 May, while recovery was committed the following week. Faure law promulgated, the University of Amiens was created on 26 October, <b>founded</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> campus in the southwestern suburbs of the city.|$|E
