40|$|Blow {{moulding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important polymer processing method for producing plastic automotive parts. Yet, there are still several problems that affect the overall success of forming these parts. Among them, are thermally induced stresses, relevant shrinkage and part warpage caused by inappropriate solidification conditions. This work presents a finite element model that allows for predicting residual stresses and subsequent deformations that arise during the cooling stage of finished parts. It is expected that the virtual presence of the <b>flash</b> <b>zone</b> has an influence on the development of residual stresses in the numerical model. Deflashing is usually performed immediately after part removal from the mould, therefore, the numerical model is adapted to take this into account. Numerical results obtained with and without flash for a simple part, as well as a complex automotive part, are compared to determine accuracy and limitations of the model.

Furthermore, the simulation model must illustrate the effect of liquid entrainment and buffer-cut wash bed performance on distillation efficiency. Vacuum distillation column internals, fouling and coking mechanism, VDU fouling and its mitigation have been discussed in the literature part. The formation of coke by decomposition of compounds at high heat flux regions in the furnace can be avoided by the increasing the steam rate in the furnace tube. The minimum liquid entrainment and improved vapor distribution to the wash bed can be achieved by installing a suitable feed inlet device in the <b>flash</b> <b>zone.</b> The wash oil reflux must be maintained above the minimum wetting rate of the packing to prevent wash beds from coking.

For the chosen accretion rates, hydrogen burns in a series of recurrent mild flashes and the ashes of hydrogen burning build up a helium layer at the base of which a He flash eventually occurs. In previous studies involving accretion at higher rates and including initially more massive WDs, the diffusion of energy inward from the H shell-flashing region contributes to the increase in the temperature {{at the base of the}} helium layer, and the mass of the helium layer when the He flash begins is significantly smaller than in a comparison model accreting pure helium; the He shell flash is not strong enough to develop into a supernova explosion. In contrast, for the conditions adopted here, the temperature at the base of the He layer becomes gradually independent of the deposition of energy by H shell flashes, and the mass of the He layer when the He flash occurs is a function only of the accretion rate, independent of the hydrogen content of the accreted matter. When the He flash takes place, due to the high degeneracy at the base of the He layer, temperatures in the <b>flashing</b> <b>zone</b> will rise without a corresponding increase in pressure, nuclear burning will continue until nuclear statistical equilibrium is achieved; the model will become a supernova, but not of the classical type Ia variety.

40|$|Abstract. The {{evolution}} of the first generations of stars at zero or extremly low metallicity, and especially some crucial properties like the primary 14 N production, is charactarized by convective-reactive mixing events that are mostly absent from similar evolution phases at solar-like metallicity.

In this paper we describe the astrophysical context of such convective-reactive events, including the difficulty of current one-dimensional stellar evolution models to correctly simulate these evolutionary phases. We then describe the requirements and current state of modeling convective-reactive processes in the first stars environment.

We estimate that {{for the production of}} first-peak heavy elements this site can be of similar importance for galactic chemical evolution as the s-process production by low-mass AGB stars. The He-shell flashes result in the expansion and, ultimately, ejection of the accreted and then i-process enriched material, via super-Eddington luminosity winds or Roche-lobe overflow. The white dwarf models do not retain any significant amount of the accreted mass, with a He retention efficiency of ≤ 10 % depending on mass and convective boundary mixing assumptions.

40|$|The He-shell flash {{convection}} in AGB {{stars is}} {{the site for the}} high-temperature component of the s-process in low- and intermediate mass giants, driven by the 22 Ne neutron source. During this phase several s-process branchings are activated, including some with time scales similar to the convective turn-over time scale. In addition, uncertainties regarding convective mixing at both the bottom and the top of the convective shell are preventing accurate predictions of s-process yields. The upper convection boundary plays a critical role during the H-ingestion episode that may lead to neutron-bursts in the most metal-poor AGB stars.

40|$|We {{present the}} first 3 -dimensional, fully {{compressible}} gas-dynamics simulations in 4 pi geometry of He-shell flash convection with proton-rich fuel entrainment {{at the upper}} boundary. This work is motivated by the insufficiently understood observed consequences of the H-ingestion flash in post-AGB stars (Sakurai’s object) and metal-poor AGB stars. Our investigation {{is focused on the}} entrainment process at the top convection boundary and on the subsequent advection of H-rich material into deeper layers, and we therefore ignore the burning of the proton-rich fuel in this study. We find that, for our deep convection zone, coherent convective motions of near global scale appear to dominate the flow. These very large-scale motions have significant impact upon the flow behavior where the H-rich fluid is entrained. Additionally, we establish the quantitative dependence of the entrainment rate on grid resolution. With our numerical technique and with the relatively stiff convective boundaries that we find to apply for H-entrainment into He-shell <b>flash</b> convection <b>zones,</b> simulations with 10243 cells or more are required to reach a numerical fidelity appropriate for the problem.

40|$|We present {{extensive}} sets {{of stellar}} models for 0. 8 - 9. 0 Msun in mass and - 5 <= [Fe/H] <= - 2 and Z = 0 in metallicity. The present work {{focuses on the}} evolutionary characteristics of hydrogen mixing into the He-flash convective zones during the core and shell He flashes which occurs for the models with [Fe/H] <~ - 2. 5. Evolution is followed from the zero age MS to the TPAGB phase including the hydrogen engulfment by the He-flash convection during the RGB or AGB phase. There exist various types of mixing episodes of how the H mixing sets in and how it affects the final abundances at the surface. In particular, we find H ingestion events without dredge-ups that enables repeated neutron-capture nucleosynthesis in the He <b>flash</b> convective <b>zones</b> with 13 C(a,n) 16 O as neutron source. For Z = 0, the mixing and dredge-up processes vary with the initial mass, which results in different final abundances in the surface. We investigate the occurrence of these events for various initial mass and metallicity to find the metallicity dependence for the He-flash driven deep mixing (He-FDDM) and also for the third dredge-up (TDU) events. In our models, we find He-FDDM for M <= 3 Msun for Z = 0 and for M <~ 2 Msun for - 5 <~ [Fe/H] <~ - 3.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} initially metal-free, low-mass Red Giant stars through the He core flash {{at the tip of}} the Red Giant Branch. The low entropy barrier between the helium- and hydrogen-rich layers enables a penetration of the helium <b>flash</b> driven convective <b>zone</b> into the inner tail of the extinguishing H-burning shell. As a consequence, protons are mixed into high-temperature regions triggering a H-burning runaway. The subsequent dredge-up of matter processed by He and H burning enriches the stellar surface with large amounts of helium, carbon and nitrogen. Extending previous results by Hollowell et al. (1990) and Fujimoto et al. (2000), who claimed that the H-burning runaway is an intrinsic property of extremely metal-poor low-mass stars, we found that its occurrence depends on additional parameters like the initial composition and the treatment of various physical processes. We perform some comparisons between predicted surface chemical abundances and observational measurements for extremely metal-deficient stars. As in previous investigations, our results disclose that although the described scenario provides a good qualitative agreement with observations, considerable discrepancies still remain. They may be due to a more comlex evolutionary path of 'real' stars, and/or some shortcomings in current evolutionary models. In addition, we analyze the evolutionary properties after the He core flash, during both the central and shell He-burning phases, allowing us to deduce some interesting differences between models whose Red Giant Branch progenitor has experienced the H-flash and canonical models. In particular, the Asymptotic Giant Branch evolution of extremely metal-deficient stars and the occurrence of thermal pulses are strongly affected by the previous RGB evolution. (orig.)

In parallel, a wealth of camera trap systems and models has become commercially available, a phenomenon mainly driven by the increased use of camera traps by sport hunters. This has raised the need for developing criteria to choose the suitable camera trap model in relation to a range of factors, primarily the study aim, but also target species, habitat, trapping site, climate and any other aspect that affects camera performance. There is also fragmented information on the fundamentals of sampling designs that deploy camera trapping, such as number of sampling sites, spatial arrangement and sampling duration. In this review, we describe the relevant technological features of camera traps and propose a set of the key ones to be evaluated when choosing camera models. These features are camera specifications such as trigger speed, sensor sensitivity, detection <b>zone,</b> <b>flash</b> type and flash intensity, power autonomy, and related specifications.

40|$|Abstract—The hindrances to the {{adoption}} of public cloud computing services include service reliability, data security and privacy, regulation compliant requirements, and so on. To ad-dress those concerns, we propose a hybrid cloud computing model which users may adopt as a viable and cost-saving methodology to make the best use of public cloud services along with their privately-owned (legacy) data centers. As the core of this hybrid cloud computing model, an in-telligent workload factoring service is designed for proactive workload management. It enables federation between on- and off-premise infrastructures for hosting Internet-based applica-tions, and the intelligence lies in the explicit segregation of base workload and flash crowd workload, the two naturally different components composing the application workload. The core technology of the intelligent workload factoring service is a fast frequent data item detection algorithm, which enables factoring incoming requests not only on volume but also on data content, upon a changing application data popularity. Through analysis and extensive evaluation with real-trace driven simulations and experiments on a hybrid testbed con-sisting of local computing platform and Amazon Cloud service platform, we showed that the proactive workload management technology can enable reliable workload prediction in the base workload zone (with simple statistical methods), achieve resource efficiency (e. g., 78 % higher server capacity than that in base workload zone) and reduce data cache/replication overhead (up to two orders of magnitude) in the <b>flash</b> crowd workload <b>zone,</b> and react fast (with an X 2 speed-up factor) to the changing application data popularity upon the arrival of load spikes.
