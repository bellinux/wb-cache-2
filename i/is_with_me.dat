2500|$|In 1922, Taft {{proposed}} {{that members of}} the Court accompany him to Philadelphia on a ceremonial occasion, but McReynolds refused to go, writing: [...] "As you know, I am not always to be found when there is a Hebrew abroad. Therefore, my 'inability' to attend must not surprise you." [...] McReynolds refused to sit next to Brandeis (where he belonged on the basis of seniority) for the Court photograph in 1924. [...] "The difficulty <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and me alone," [...] McReynolds wrote Taft. [...] "I have absolutely refused to go through the bore of picture-taking again until there is a change in the Court, and maybe not even then." [...] Taft capitulated, and no photograph was taken that year.|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{accounts}} of Josiah's {{death in the}} Bible. The Books of Kings merely state that Necho II met Josiah at Megiddo and killed him (...) [...] The Book of Chronicles (...) gives a lengthier account and states that Josiah was fatally wounded by Egyptian archers and was brought back to Jerusalem to die. His death {{was a result of}} [...] "not listen to what Necho had said at God's command..." [...] when Necho stated: [...] "What have I to do with you, king of Judah? I am not coming against you today, but against the house with which I am at war; [...] and God has commanded me to hurry. Cease opposing God, who <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> so that he will not destroy you." [...] (NRSV) ...|$|E

Three months ago I promised Lord Clarendon, and his government, in this country, that I would provoke {{him into his}} courts of justice, as places of this kind are called, and that I would force him publicly and notoriously to pack a Jury against me to convict me, or else that if I would walk out a free man from this dock, to meet him in another field. My lord, I knew I was setting my life on that cast; but I warned him that in either event the victory would be with me, and the victory <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> Neither the jury, nor the judges, nor any other man in this court, presumes to imagine {{that it is a}} criminal who stands in this dock.

And I am sad because John Barleycorn <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> And John Barleycorn <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> because I was born in what future ages will call the dark ages before the ages of rational civilisation. John Barleycorn <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> because in all the unwitting days of my youth John Barleycorn was accessible, calling to me and inviting me on every corner and on every street between the corners. The pseudo-civilisation into which I was born permitted everywhere licensed shops {{for the sale of}} soul-poison. The system of life was so organised that I (and millions like me) was lured and drawn and driven to the poison shops.|$|E

5000|$|One of Jesus' {{statements}} {{before he}} died were the words to a man hanging alongside him, [...] "you will <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in Paradise." [...] The New World Translation places a comma after the word 'today', dividing it into two separate phrases, [...] "I tell you today" [...] and [...] "you will <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in Paradise". This differs from standard translations of this verse as [...] "I tell you today you will <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in Paradise". Based on scriptures such as Matthew 12:40, 27:63, Mark 8:31 and 9:31, Witnesses believe Jesus' expectation {{that he would be}} bodily resurrected after three days precluded his being in paradise {{on the same day that}} he died.|$|R
