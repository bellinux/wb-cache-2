5|$|A {{large number}} of {{chemical}} compounds are known to exhibit one or several liquid crystalline phases. Despite significant differences <b>in</b> <b>chemical</b> composition, these molecules have some common features <b>in</b> <b>chemical</b> and physical properties. There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotics, bowlics and rod-shaped molecules. Discotics are flat disc-like molecules consisting of a core of adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a bowlic is not flat but like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object). This allows for two dimensional columnar ordering, for both discotics and bowlics. Rod-shaped molecules have an elongated, anisotropic geometry which allows for preferential alignment along one spatial direction.|$|E

5|$|A {{thallium}} atom has 81 electrons, {{arranged in}} the electron configuration 4f145d106s26p1; of these, the three outermost electrons {{in the sixth}} shell are valence electrons.

Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to the neighboring elements mercury and lead, and hence thallium, like its congeners, is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point of 304°C.|$|E

5|$|Being {{the first}} period 8 element, ununennium is {{predicted}} to be an alkali metal, below lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium. Each of these elements has one valence electron in the outermost s-orbital (valence electron configuration ns1), which is easily lost <b>in</b> <b>chemical</b> reactions to form the +1 oxidation state: thus the alkali metals are very reactive elements. Ununennium is predicted to continue the trend and have a valence electron configuration of 8s1. It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties.|$|E

40|$|Entry Barriers and Concentration <b>in</b> <b>Chemicals</b> Shipping" {{is part of}} SNF project 1650 Strategisk atferd i noen utvalgte shippingsegmenter (Strategic {{behaviour}} in some selected shipping segments. Deep-sea chemicals shipping has for {{the last}} decade been dominated by four major players, Stolt-Nielsen, Odfjell, JOTankers and Seachem. During the same period, the risk-adjusted return of these operators has seemingly been higher than for other operators in comparable shipping markets. This report seeks to gain insight in the underlying mechanisms that have sustained the high-return oligopoly <b>in</b> the <b>chemicals</b> shipping market. The first question the report seeks to answer, is whether the oligopolists have exercised market power to deter entry from new competitors and, if yes, in what way. Secondly the report investigates the potential role of price collusion in the market. The purpose of the report is to shed light on both the question of entry deterrence and the question of collusion through theory of industrial organisation. The research strategy is to derive theoretical predictions of optimal behaviour <b>in</b> the <b>chemicals</b> market and then confront these predictions with factual behaviour from chemicals shipping. The report has two main findings. First, it is proposed that the leading incumbents follow a top dog strategy towards potential competition. This means that the established operators <b>in</b> <b>chemicals</b> shipping act tough to restrain small players and prevent potential new entrants. Toughness to deter competition can for instance be seen in the high level of investment <b>in</b> new <b>chemical</b> tankers <b>in</b> recent years, and in the high investments in "state of the art" maintenance of current vessels. Second, on the question of price collusion, it is proposed that the multimarket contact that is prevalent <b>in</b> <b>chemicals</b> shipping can sustain a situation with price collusion. However, this issue needs to be further explored in more data-intensive studies...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide {{benchmark}} comparisons of manufacturing unit value ratios and productivity levels for the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland relative to Germany in 1996. On average, manufacturing prices were {{about half of}} those in Germany for all three countries. Hungary was characterised by relatively low price levels in Food Processing, but relatively high price levels <b>in</b> <b>Chemicals,</b> Rubber and Plastic Products, Non-Metallic Mineral Products and Electrical Equipment. Poland appeared weak on price competitiveness in Wood and Wood Products and Printing and Publishing. The Czech Republic has relatively low price levels <b>in</b> <b>Chemicals.</b> For Total Manufacturing, Hungary shows a clear productivity advantage despite a comparable relative price level (compare Figure 1). The Hungarian productivity advantage is in strong Food Products, Paper and Printing, and Wood Products (even though in the latter case it is benefitting from low relative price levels), but also in Machinery and Transport Equipment and in Other Manufacturing. The Polish productivity level is high in Rubber and Plastic Products, and in the Czech Republic it is high <b>in</b> <b>Chemicals,</b> which <b>in</b> both cases is reflected by relatively low price levels.
