5|$|A heavy chick {{mortality}} at a {{large and}} important colony of the magnificent frigatebird, located on Île du Grand Connétable off French Guiana, was recorded in summer 2005. Chicks showed nodular skin lesions, feather loss and corneal changes, with around half the year's progeny perishing across the colony. An alphaherpesvirus was isolated and provisionally named Fregata magnificens herpesvirus, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> whether it caused the outbreak or affected birds already suffering malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|All serials in {{this season}} {{continue}} directly one after the other, tracing one single problematic voyage of the TARDIS crew. Despite the continuity, each serial is considered its own standalone story. This season also introduced the character of Harry Sullivan as a companion; this character was intended to undertake action scenes, during the period prior to Tom Baker being cast, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> how old the actor playing the new Doctor would be.|$|E
5|$|Parents of {{children}} with Asperger syndrome can typically trace differences in their children's development to as early as 30 months of age. Developmental screening during a routine check-up by a general practitioner or pediatrician may identify signs that warrant further investigation. The United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2016 found <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there are no concerns.|$|E

5|$|Two {{months after}} the protests in Shifang, {{residents}} told the New York Times {{that there were no}} signs that the Sichuan Hongda project was being resuscitated, and that the city had been quiet since the demonstrations concluded. An executive with Sichuan Hongda told Caijing magazine on July 9 that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> whether the construction for copper plant would go forward in the future, and whether it would be located in Sichuan province.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} of the hazard maps {{published}} in the prominent El Espectador newspaper in Bogotá included glaring errors. Without proper graphic scaling, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> how big the map's hazard zones really were. The lahars on the map did not have a distinct ending point, and the main threat seemed to be from pyroclastic flows, not from mudflows. Though the map was colored blue, green, red, and yellow, there was no key to indicate what each color represented, and Armero was located in the green zone (believed to indicate the safest area.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{parasitic}} liver diseases may be {{risk factors}} as well. Colonization with the liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini (found in Thailand, Laos PDR, and Vietnam) or Clonorchis sinensis (found in China, Taiwan, eastern Russia, Korea, and Vietnam) {{has been associated}} with the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with chronic liver disease, whether in the form of viral hepatitis (e.g. hepatitis B or hepatitis C), alcoholic liver disease, or cirrhosis of the liver due to other causes, are at significantly increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. HIV infection was also identified in one study as a potential risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> whether HIV itself or other correlated and confounding factors (e.g. hepatitis C infection) were responsible for the association.|$|E

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> when Renaud {{assumed the}} countship of Soissons from his disgraced father. The latter was {{stripped}} of the County of Eu in 1050 but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> when he relinquished the countship of Soissons. Alberic of Trois-Fontaines identifies Renaud in his Chronicles but {{little is known about}} his rule.|$|R
5|$|During {{this time}} of turmoil, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> who {{actually}} governed the colonies: Joseph I, the shadow government representing Ferdinand VII, the colonial officials, or revolutionaries in each province. The Mexican War of Independence began in 1810 at the instigation of Miguel Hidalgo. Fearing that the revolution would reach colonial Texas, governor Manuel María de Salcedo ordered the Texas borders closed to all foreigners. He was soon reversed by his uncle, the Commandant General. Revolutionaries soon overthrew and imprisoned Salcedo, and a new government was established in Texas. Salcedo persuaded Ignacio Elizondo (his jailer) {{to return to the}} royalist cause and the two organized a counter-coup. Hidalgo was captured and executed in 1811.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> if Beth Israel, {{which had}} already been in {{difficult}} financial shape, would be allowed, or have the means, to re-build its synagogue. The building suffered further flood damage in July 2007 when thieves stole the copper tubing for the main air-conditioning system. They broke the water main, and water from the second floor flooded the building for three days, {{to a depth of}} three to four feet, before it was discovered. The property was put up for sale.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{after the}} {{cancellation}} of their Psychoville, writers Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith were commissioned to produce two series for the BBC by controllers Janice Hadlow and Cheryl Taylor, partially in response to Sky beginning to produce comedy. At the time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> whether this would be two series of Inside No. 9, then known by the working title Happy Endings, or a series of Inside No. 9 {{and a series of}} some other programme. Inside No. 9 was to be produced by a BBC team, which was later revealed to be David Kerr (director), Jon Plowman (executive producer) and Adam Tandy (producer).|$|E

50|$|NAIS, New York is a co-educational, non-selective school. Students {{applying}} are {{not required}} to sit an entrance exam. However, when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> if a child has the appropriate level of English, additional learning needs, or if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> which year the child should enter then the appropriate assessments are administered.|$|R
5|$|In January 1531, Campeggio was {{dismissed}} as cardinal protector, {{although it did}} not become public knowledge until May. At first <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> whether Henry VIII intended to appoint a successor, with Giovanni Domenico de Cupis emerging as an active candidate in March 1532. The king favoured Alessandro Farnese (future Pope Paul III), and instructed his ambassadors on 21 March to offer it to Farnese, and then de Cupis or Giovanni del Monte (future Pope Julius III) {{in the event that}} Farnese declined or was not approved.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years Edouard Ravel {{declared}} his intention to leave {{the bulk of the}} composer's estate to the city of Paris for the endowment of a Nobel Prize in music, but evidently changed his mind. After his death in 1960 the estate passed through several hands. Despite the substantial royalties paid for performing Ravel's music, the news magazine Le Point reported in 2000 that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> who the beneficiaries were. The British newspaper The Guardian reported in 2001 that no money from royalties had been forthcoming for the maintenance of the Ravel museum at Montfort-l'Amaury, which was in a poor state of repair.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> how Hsu {{could have}} {{remained}} at large for 15 years {{and engage in}} prominent political activity without being detected. It was also unclear how a convicted felon, having already fled prosecution once, was allowed out on bail without first having to surrender his passport. Prior to Hsu's second attempt to flee, James Brosnahan, Hsu's attorney in California, defended Hsu stating that Hsu's prominence showed {{that he did not}} behave like a fugitive and that Hsu was moving towards a resolution of the matter, including a plan of restitution for victims of Hsu's actions.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} {{generally}} resident across its range, but sightings of solitary and silent birds {{have suggested that}} the species may be migratory in Bolivia and Brazil. A study published in 2005 suggested it was migratory in Santa Fe, Argentina, as the species was not observed in the area between March and September (the austral winter). In 2006 the species was reported {{for the first time in}} Peru, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> if this represented a vagrant escaping cold weather or a migrant, as the species is mostly uncommon across its range and that area is poorly studied ornithologically.|$|E
5|$|As Taylor took office, Congress faced {{a battery}} of {{questions}} related to the Mexican Cession, acquired by the U.S. after the Mexican War and divided into military districts. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> which districts would be established into states and which would become federal territories, while the question of their slave status threatened to bitterly divide Congress. Additionally, many in the South had grown increasingly angry about the aid that northerners had given to fugitive slaves. While a southern slaveowner himself, Taylor believed that slavery was economically infeasible in the Mexican Cession, and as such he opposed slavery in those territories as a needless source of controversy. His major goal was sectional peace, preserving the Union through legislative compromise. As the threat of Southern secession grew, he sided increasingly with antislavery northerners such as Senator William H. Seward of New York, even suggesting that he would sign the Wilmot Proviso to ban slavery in federal territories should such a bill reach his desk.|$|E
5|$|Despite being fit he {{was often}} {{overlooked}} by then-manager Jacques Santini. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> as to whether Santini really wanted him at all as there was much media speculation that Carrick was bought by Tottenham's Director of Football Frank Arnesen rather than Santini. However, following the departure of Santini and the appointment of new manager Martin Jol he soon emerged as a regular starter in midfield. His first full start for Tottenham was also Jol's first game {{in charge of the}} club away to Burnley in the League Cup on 9 November. During the game he assisted a goal for Robbie Keane as they went on to win 3–0. On 18 December, he produced a display that was influential in helping Tottenham to a 5–1 win at home over Southampton. Carrick subsequently ended the 2004–05 season with 29 league appearances but failed to score as they finished the table in 9th and missed out on a UEFA Cup spot.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, Tongan mission {{president}} John H. Groberg {{declared that}} a 50th Anniversary Golden Jubilee would be held. The concept for the celebration was confusing to church members as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> what the 50th anniversary was honoring. Groberg {{was not quite}} sure himself. However, several years prior to his appointment as mission president, Groberg received inspiration that he would preside over the mission in Tonga and hold a 50th anniversary jubilee during his term. A {{few months before the}} celebration, which was scheduled for November, Groberg received a letter from the widow of Tonga's first mission president. In the letter, she shared that the mission's first conference was held in November 1918. The anniversary of the Tonga's first mission-wide conference became the reason for the jubilee.|$|E
5|$|In September 1887, Robinson {{wrote to}} Lobengula, through Moffat, urging the king not to grant {{concessions}} {{of any kind}} to Transvaal, German or Portuguese agents without first consulting the missionary. Moffat reached Bulawayo on 29 November to find Grobler still there. Because the exact text of the Grobler treaty had not been released publicly, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> to outside observers precisely what had been agreed with Lobengula in July; in the uncertainty, newspapers in South Africa were reporting that the treaty had made Matabeleland a protectorate of the South African Republic. Moffat made enquiries in Bulawayo. Grobler denied the newspaper reports of a Transvaal protectorate over Lobengula's country, while the king said that an agreement did exist, {{but that it was}} a renewal of the Pretorius peace treaty and nothing more.|$|E
5|$|Just {{after midnight}} on September 6, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was ordered back to Pusan {{in order to}} travel to Japan and merge with other Marine units to form the 1st Marine Division. This was done after a heated {{disagreement}} between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. Walker {{said he could not}} hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur said he could not conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning the 17th Infantry Regiment, and later the 65th Infantry Regiment, would be added to Walker's reserves, but Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective. Walker felt the transition endangered the Perimeter at a time when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> if it would hold.|$|E
50|$|Once a {{plant is}} {{infected}} with OFV, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> whether pruning visibly infected tissue will cure the plant of the virus. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> also <b>unclear</b> whether infected plants produce seeds containing viral particles.|$|R
