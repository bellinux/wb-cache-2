40|$|Mining {{sector has}} always been a driving force in country’s growth. Thermal energy is {{generated}} using coal as major raw material which has to be mined and handled before it could be used for power generation or in other industries. Extraction of mineral wealth from underground sources is filled with many uncertainties, rock characteristics is one of those. It is essential to predict the strength of rocks underlying and overlaying the coal so that safe mine could be designed. Various <b>failure</b> <b>criteria</b> have been developed to predict the nature of rock mass failure and its behavior. No <b>failure</b> <b>criteria</b> has been as yet designed specifically for Talcher area. Using the four existing <b>failure</b> <b>criteria</b> and six bore holes’ data, a <b>failure</b> <b>criteria</b> has been developed for Talcher area. Mohr coulomb <b>failure</b> <b>criteria</b> proves to be least acceptable to predict the behavior of Talcher rock mass.

40|$|The design {{optimization}} of laminated composites using naturally inspired optimization {{techniques such as}} vector evaluated particle swarm optimization (VEPSO) and genetic algorithms (GA) are used in this paper. The {{design optimization}} of minimum weight of the laminated composite is evaluated using different <b>failure</b> <b>criteria.</b> The <b>failure</b> <b>criteria</b> considered are maximum stress (MS), Tsai-Wu (TW) and failure mechanism based (FMB) <b>failure</b> <b>criteria.</b> Minimum weight of the laminates are obtained for different <b>failure</b> <b>criteria</b> using VEPSO and GA for different combinations of loading. From the study {{it is evident that}} VEPSO and GA predict almost the same minimum weight of the laminate for the given loading. Comparison of minimum weight of the laminates by different <b>failure</b> <b>criteria</b> differ for some loading combinations. The comparison shows that FMBFC provide better results for all combinations of loading. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Design {{of mining}} and civil {{structures}} in rock typically involves a <b>failure</b> <b>criterion</b> that is cohesive-frictional. The <b>failure</b> <b>criterion</b> {{is used to}} determine whether a state of stress in the rock will lead to inelastic behavior, including brittle failure. For rocks under high hydrostatic stresses, brittle failure is preceded by plastic deformation and the <b>failure</b> <b>criterion</b> is used to determine the onset of plastic deformation. Typically, perfect plasticity is assumed beyond the yield point. However strain hardening and softening relations with nonlocal inelasticity and damage have also been used. Failure criteria and yield surfaces are also often augmented with a cap to avoid unphysical situations where extreme hydrostatic stress states do not lead to failure or plastic deformation.|$|E

40|$|A {{new set of}} <b>failure</b> <b>criteria</b> {{to predict}} {{composite}} failure in single lap bolted joints is proposed. The pres ent <b>failure</b> <b>criteria</b> are an extension of Chang Lessard criteria considering a three dimensional stress field and including out of plane failure modes. The advantage with respect to other three dimensional <b>failure</b> <b>criteria</b> is the consideration of non linear shear stress strain relationship. The <b>failure</b> <b>criteria</b> were imple mented in a finite element model and validated through comparison with experiments in literature. Stresses were calculated by a non linear finite element model developed in ABAQUS/Standard which con siders material and geometric nonlinearities. A progressive damage model was implemented in a USDFLD subroutine. The model predicted the effect of secondary bending and tightening torque showing an excel lent agreement with experimental results.

40|$|The {{empirical}} rock <b>failure</b> <b>criteria</b> play {{an important}} role in predicting the mechanical behavior of rocks, since affecting parameters on the behavioral properties of rocks are complex and numerous. Usually the empirical <b>failure</b> <b>criteria</b> are obtained by statistical methods, namely by means of fitting the mathematical function onto the experimental data.

This paper studies the efficiency and accuracy of conventional empirical rock <b>failure</b> <b>criteria</b> using a new approach, which is based on the analysis of uncertainty amplitude on the constant parameters of each criterion. The approach adopted here, is based on the combination of some parameters such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), type of function, degree of freedom and the confidence level of constants. Correlation coefficient (R 2) is then a comprehensive test and can be used effectively for comparison and accuracy of empirical rock <b>failure</b> <b>criteria...</b>|$|R
