25|$|Authenticity {{continues}} to ignite interest among tourism and marketing scholars and brand heritage can induce {{the feeling of}} authentic experience and increase customer retention. In particular kintsugi implies that the authentic <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>which</b> displays and values its true, dynamic relation to history. By highlighting that the authentic object or site <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>which,</b> despite the ravages of time, retains cultural value (be that local, national, and/or international), site managers can re-figure and promote a conception of authenticity to tourists.|$|E

25|$|Prayer can {{be divided}} into vocal and mental types. Vocal prayer <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>which</b> is made by using some {{approved}} form of words, read or recited; such as the sign of the cross, the Liturgy of the Hours (Divine Office), the Angelus, grace before and after meals, etc. Mental prayer <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>which</b> is made without employing either words or formulas of any kind. Catholics are exhorted to beware of underrating the usefulness or necessity of vocal prayer. Common vocal prayers include the Lord's Prayer (Our Father, Pater Noster), the Hail Mary (Ave Maria, Angelic Salutation), the Glory Be (Gloria Patri, Minor Doxology), and the Apostles' Creed (Symbolum Apostolorum).|$|E

25|$|Vaisheshika espouses {{a form of}} atomism, {{that the}} reality is {{composed}} of four substances (earth, water, air, fire). Each of these four are of two types, explains Ganeri, atomic (paramāṇu) and composite. An atom <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>which</b> is indestructible (anitya), indivisible, and has {{a special kind of}} dimension, called “small” (aṇu). A composite <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>which</b> is divisible into atoms. Whatever human beings perceive is composite, and even the smallest perceptible thing, namely, a fleck of dust, has parts, which are therefore invisible. The Vaiśeṣikas visualized the smallest composite thing as a “triad” (tryaṇuka) with three parts, each part with a “dyad” (dyaṇuka). Vaiśeṣikas believed that a dyad has two parts, each of which is an atom. Size, form, truths and everything that human beings experience as a whole is a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements.|$|E

25|$|For Aristotle, {{the soul}} (psyche) was a simpler concept {{than it is}} for us today. By soul he simply meant the form of a living being.

25|$|Various other notes (relatively flat or sharp {{with respect}} {{to those of the}} major scale) can be {{accessed}} by cross fingering techniques, and all the notes (except the lowest of each octave/register) can be flattened by half holing. Perhaps the most effective and most used cross fingering <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>which</b> produces a flattened form of the seventh note (B flat instead of B on a C whistle, for example, or C natural instead of C sharp on a D whistle). This makes available another major scale (F on a C whistle, G on a D whistle).|$|E
25|$|The {{dilemma is}} that {{classical}} evolutionary theory says {{that what is}} maintained in a lineage <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>which</b> ensures the viability of an organism and its offspring. Ageing can only cut off an individual's capacity to reproduce. So, according to classical theory, ageing could only evolve as a side effect, or epiphenomenon of selection. The disposable soma theory and antagonistic pleiotropy theory are examples in which a compensating individual benefit, compatible with classical evolution theory (See neo-Darwinism) is proposed. Nevertheless, there is accumulated evidence that ageing looks like an adaptation in its own right, selected for its own sake.|$|E
25|$|The first {{condition}} {{is to allow}} for applications near band edges.

The third {{condition is}} to avoid evanescent-wave coupling via higher order modes. The fourth condition <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>which</b> allows a 2:1 operation bandwidth. Although it is possible to have a 2:1 operating bandwidth when the height is less than half the width, having the height exactly half the width maximizes the power that can propagate inside the waveguide before dielectric breakdown occurs.|$|E
