40|$|Studies of {{the most}} <b>immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> {{progenitors}} in the human thymus have been hampered {{by the lack of}} markers and assays that define these cells. In this report we used a novel human fetal thymic organ culture system to determine the potential of T cell precursors isolated from human postnatal thymus, to differentiate into CD 3 + thymocytes, and to investigate early stages of human T cell development. It was found that thymocytes that lack the markers CD 3, CD 4, and CD 8 (triple negative [TN]) can differentiate in an allogeneic organotypic thymic culture. The capacity of TN thymocytes to differentiate was exclusively confined to the CD 34 + population. CD 34 - TN thymocytes failed to differentiate in this system. In contrast, cloned lines of CD 3 - thymocytes could only be established from CD 34 - TN thymocytes. Five subsets of CD 3 - thymocytes were found with the following phenotype: CD 1 -TN, CD 1 +TN, CD 1 +CD 4 +CD 8 -, CD 1 +CD 4 +CD 8 alpha+ beta-, and CD 1 +CD 4 +CD 8 alpha beta+. These subpopulations expressed decreasing levels of CD 34. The CD 1 -CD 3 - population expressed the highest levels of CD 34 supporting the notion that this population is the most <b>immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> precursor in the thymus, whereas the CD 1 +CD 4 +CD 8 alpha+ beta+ which did not express CD 34 seems to be the most mature of these CD 3 - populations. This notion is supported by the observations that CD 34 + cells isolated from fetal liver, which differentiated into T cells in a FTOC, developed into CD 3 + cells via CD 1 - and CD 4 +CD 8 - intermediates.

40|$|The {{failure of}} Thy- 1 and Ly- 6 to trigger interleukin- 2 {{production}} {{in the absence of}} surface T-cell antigen receptor complex (TCR) expression has been interpreted to suggest that functional signalling via these phosphatidylinositol-linked alternative activation molecules is dependent on the TCR. We find, in contrast, that stimulation of <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> via Thy- 1 or Ly- 6 in the absence of TCR expression does trigger a biological response, the cell suicide process of activation-driven cell death. Activation-driven cell death is a process of physiological cell death that likely represents the mechanism of negative selection of <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> The absence of the TCR further reveals that signalling leading to activation-driven cell death and to lymphokine production are distinct and dissociable. In turn, the ability of alternative activation molecules to function {{in the absence of the}} TCR raises another issue: why <b>immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> thymomas, and hybrids fail to undergo activation-driven cell death in response to stimulation via Thy- 1 and Ly- 6. One possibility is that these activation molecules on <b>immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are defective. Alternatively, susceptibility to activation-driven cell death may be developmentally regulated by TCR-independent factors. We have explored these possibilities with somatic cell hybrids between mature and <b>immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> in which Thy- 1 and Ly- 6 are contributed exclusively by the immature partner. The hybrid cells exhibit sensitivity to activation-driven cell death triggered via Thy- 1 and Ly- 6.

40|$|Self-recognition and {{self-tolerance}} are two {{characteristics of}} the receptor repertoire expressed by functionally reactive T cells. Both of these facets of the T cell receptor repertoire are importantly influenced by {{the environment in which}} <b>immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> precursors differentiate. For example, T cells specifically recognize as self the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) l-encoded determinants expressed by cellular elements in their differentiation environment, and fail to recognize as foreign the non-MHC-encoded determinants that are also present in their differentiation environment. It is now known that the nonlymphoid cells present within the thymus perform a unique role in determining the MHC specificities that T cells recognize as self-restriction elements (1, 2). In contrast, the precise role of the thymus in establishing self-tolerance is less clear. From experiments performed in mice engrafted with allogeneic thymuses, it is known that thymic nonlymphoid cells can induce tolerance to antigens that only they express (3).

40|$|During their {{development}} in the thymus, <b>immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> generate and express a unique <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor (TCR) with a virtually random antigenic specificity.

According to the traditional model, only those <b>immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> with an intermediate affinity for self-antigens, which are deemed functional yet not too autoreactive, are permitted to mature. Somewhat unexpectedly, recent studies have suggested that <b>immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> destined to develop into regulatory <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> (Treg), an uncommon type of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> that is involved in the inhibition of adaptive immune responses, are significantly more autoreactive than those that develop into conventional <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> We tested this theory by investigating the influence of autoreactivity on the commitment of developing mouse <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> to the regulatory <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> lineage.

40|$|PTEN is a tumor {{suppressor}} gene but whether cancer can develop in all PTEN-deficient cells is not known. In T cell-specific PTEN-deficient (tPTEN−/−) mice, which suffer from mature T cell lymphomas, we found that premalignancy, as defined by elevated AKT and senescence pathways, starts in <b>immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> precursors and surprisingly not in mature T cells. Premalignancy only starts in 6 -week-old mice and becomes much stronger in 9 -week-old mice although PTEN is lost since birth. tPTEN−/− immature T cells do not become tumors, and senescence has no role in this model because these cells exist in a novel cell cycle state, expressing proliferating proteins but not proliferating to any significant degree. Instead, the levels of p 27 kip 1, which is lower in tPTEN−/− immature T cells and almost nonexistent in tPTEN−/− mature T cells, correlate with the proliferation capability of these cells. Interestingly, transient reduction of these cancer precursor cells in adult tPTEN−/− mice within a crucial time window significantly delayed lymphomas and mouse lethality.

In the absence of E 47 activity, positive selection of both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I – and class II–restricted T cell receptors (TCRs) is perturbed. Additionally, development of CD 8 lineage T cells in an MHC class I–restricted TCR transgenic background is sensitive to the dosage of E 47. Mice deficient for E 47 display an increase in production of mature CD 4 and CD 8 lineage T cells.

40|$|The Ikaros gene encodes {{multiple}} protein isoforms {{that contribute}} critical functions {{during the development}} of lymphocytes and other hematopoietic cell types. The intracellular functions of Ikaros are not known, although {{recent studies have shown}} that Ikaros proteins colocalize with inactive genes and centromeric heterochromatin. In this study, Ikaros proteins were found to be components of highly stable complexes. The complexes from an <b>immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> line were purified, revealing associated proteins of 70 and 30 kD. The p 70 gene, named Helios, encodes two protein isoforms with zinc finger domains exhibiting considerable homology to those within Ikaros proteins. Helios and Ikaros recognize similar DNA sequences and, when overexpressed, Helios associates indiscriminately with the various Ikaros isoforms. Although Ikaros is present in most hematopoietic cells, Helios was found primarily in T cells. The relevance of the Ikaros–Helios interaction in T cells is supported by the quantitative association of Helios with a fraction of the Ikaros. Interestingly, the Ikaros–Helios complexes localize to the centromeric regions of T cell nuclei, similar to the Ikaros localization previously observed in B cells. Unlike the B cell results, however, {{only a fraction of the}} Ikaros, presumably the fraction associated with Helios, exhibited centromeric localization in T cells. These results establish immunoaffinity chromatography as a useful method for identifying Ikaros partners and suggest that Helios is a limiting regulatory subunit for Ikaros within centromeric heterochromatin...|$|E
40|$|NK 1. 1 + T [natural killer (NK) T] cells {{express an}} {{invariant}} T cell antigen receptor alpha chain (TCR alpha) encoded by V alpha 14 and J alpha 281 segments {{in association with}} {{a limited number of}} V betas, predominantly V beta 8. 2. Expression of the invariant V alpha 14 /J alpha 281, but not V alpha 1, TCR in transgenic mice lacking endogenous TCR alpha expression blocks the development of conventional T alpha beta cells and leads to the preferential development of V alpha 14 NK T cells, suggesting a prerequisite role of invariant V alpha 14 TCR in NK T cell development. In V beta 8. 2 but not B beta 3 transgenic mice, two NK T cells with different CD 3 epsilon expressions, CD 3 epsilon(dim) and CD 3 epsilon(high), can be identified. CD 3 epsilon(high) NK T cells express surface V alpha 14 /V beta 8 TCR, indicating a mature cell type, whereas CD 3 epsilon(dim) NK T cells express V beta 8 without V alpha 14 TCR and no significant CD 3 epsilon expression (CD 3 epsilon(dim)) on the cell surface. However, the latter are positive for recombination activating gene (RAG- 1 and RAG- 2) mRNA, which are only expressed in the precursor or <b>immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> lineage, and also possess CD 3 epsilon mRNA in their cytoplasm, suggesting that CD 3 epsilon(dim) NK T cells are the precursor of V alpha 14 NK T cells...|$|E
40|$|It has {{recently}} been recognized that CD 44 comprises a large family of alternatively spliced forms. In the thymus, CD 44 has been postulated {{to play an important}} role in <b>immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> migration and maturation. In this paper, we have studied the expression of CD 44 molecules and two CD 44 ligands, hyaluronan (HA) and fibronectin (FN), during human thymic fetal development. We found that mAbs against all CD 44 isoforms (A 3 D 8 or A 1 G 3) reacted with both thymic epithelial (TE) cells and thymocytes beginning at the time of initial colonization of the human thymus by hematopoietic stem cells at 8. 2 weeks of fetal gestation. However, mAbs specific for splice variants of CD 44 containing membrane-proximal inserts (11. 24, 11. 10 and 11. 9) reacted only with terminally differentiated TE cells in and around Hassall's bodies beginning at 16 - 19 weeks of fetal gestation. Studies of differentiated versus undifferentiated TE cells in vitro confirmed the selective expression of CD 44 variant isoforms on terminally differentiated TE cells. Expression of HA and FN was determined by fluorescence microscopy using either biotlnylated-HA binding protein or an anti-FN mAb. We found that whereas FN was present throughout the human fetal thymus beginning at 8. 2 weeks, HA was not present until 16 weeks of gestational age. These data demonstrate the differential expression of standard versus variant CD 44 isoforms during thymic ontogeny and implicate CD 44 interactions with ligands other than HA as important in the earlier stages of humanthymus developmen...|$|E
40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{expression}} of cell surface antigens {{and their relationship}} to the sequence of T-cell differentiation were delineated by the application of a series of monoclonal antibodies against <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> on tissue sections. The morphologic features and location of T-cell differentiation can be categorized into four stages: 1) subcapsular thymocytes, 2) cortical thymocytes, 3) medullary thymocytes, and 4) peripheral <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> Phenotypically, on the basis of reactivity with monoclonal antibodies, <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> could be separated into two groups: <b>immature</b> and mature <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> All stages of <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> expressed <b>T</b> 200, Lyt 3, Leu 1, OKT 3, Leu 9, and TA 1, although staining intensities varied between thymic cortex and medulla. Mature <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> (medullary thymocytes and peripheral <b>T</b> <b>cells)</b> stained more intensely than <b>immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> for some antigens, such as Leu 1, OKT 3, and Leu 9, and, therefore, probably have a greater antigen density. <b>Immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> exemplified by subcapsular and cortical thymocytes, were characterized by the expression of Tdt, Leu M 3, OKT 6, OKT 9, J 5, BA- 2, OKT 10, and usually coexpressed both helper (T 4 /Leu 3 a) and suppressor (T 8 /Leu 2 a) antigens. With further maturation, medullary thymocytes and peripheral <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> lost reactivity for the above-mentioned markers, acquired A 1 G 3 and Leu 8, and segregated into either T 4 +/Leu 3 a+ or T 8 +/Leu 2 a+ cells. A subpopulation of <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in germinal centers differs from the majority of peripheral <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> by virtue of an absence of expression of Leu 8 /A 1 G 3. This histologically localized subset of <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> may be responsible for the mediation of helper function within the germinal center...|$|R
40|$|To detect {{targeted}} antileukemia agents we {{have designed}} a novel, high-content in vivo screen using genetically engineered, T-cell reporting zebrafish. We exploited the developmental similarities between normal and malignant T lymphoblasts to screen a small molecule library for activity against <b>immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> {{with a simple}} visual readout in zebrafish larvae. After screening 26 400 molecules, we identified Lenaldekar (LDK), a compound that eliminates <b>immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in developing zebrafish without affecting the cell cycle in other cell types. LDK is well tolerated in vertebrates and induces long-term remission in adult zebrafish with cMYC-induced T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). LDK causes dephosphorylation {{of members of the}} PI 3 kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway and delays sensitive cells in late mitosis. Among human cancers, LDK selectively affects survival of hematopoietic malignancy lines and primary leukemias, including therapy-refractory B-ALL and chronic myelogenous leukemia samples, and inhibits growth of human T-ALL xenografts. This work demonstrates the utility of our method using zebrafish for antineoplastic candidate drug identification and suggests a new approach for targeted leukemia therapy. Although our efforts focused on leukemia therapy, this screening approach has broad implications as it can be translated to other cancer types involving malignant degeneration of developmentally arrested cells...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} {{the expression of the}} Leu- 4 (T 3) antigen on the cell surface and in the cytoplasm of blast cells from 23 patients with <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> acute lymphoblastic leukemia and <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> lymphoblastic lymphoma. In the majority of cases (17), the Leu 4 antigen was absent from the cell surface; however, in 16 of these 17 cases, blast cells demonstrated cytoplasmic expression of Leu 4. This discordance between surface and cytoplasmic expression of Leu 4 was also found in thymocytes and appeared to be restricted to Leu 4, in that tests of other <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> antigens rarely revealed discordance between surface and cytoplasmic expression. To study further the cytoplasmic determinant identified by anti-Leu 4 in malignant T lympho-blasts, immunoprecipitation studies were performed that utilized biosynthetic labeling of established <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> lines derived from T lymphoblastic malignancies. By one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electropheresis, identical Leu 4 polypeptide families were immunoprecipitated from sur-face Leu 4 + and surface Leu 4 -/cytoplasmic Leu 4 + <b>cell</b> lines. Because <b>T</b> lymphoblastic malignancies represent prolif-erations of <b>immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> and because the cases studied demonstrated surface phenotypes corresponding to all of the proposed stages of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> ontogeny, it appears that cytoplasmic expression of Leu 4 occurs early in <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> development. The reason for the failure of these <b>immature</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> to transport the Leu 4 molecule to their surface remains to be elucidated...|$|R
