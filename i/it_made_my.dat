500|$|During the tour, filmmaker Baz Luhrmann {{commissioned}} Radiohead {{to write}} a song for his upcoming film Romeo + Juliet and gave them the final 30 minutes of the film. Yorke said: [...] "When we saw the scene in which Claire Danes holds the Colt [...]45 against her head, we started working on the song immediately." [...] Soon afterwards, the band wrote and recorded [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)"; the track plays over the film's end credits but was excluded from the soundtrack album at the band's request. The song helped shape {{the direction of the}} rest of the album; Yorke said it [...] "was the first performance we'd ever recorded where every note of <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> head spin—something I was proud of, something I could turn up really, really loud and not wince at any moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Competing at {{her first}} Olympics {{at the age}} of 24, Christine Merrill was the sole female {{participant}} to run for Sri Lanka in athletics competition. She qualified for the Games by using a wildcard because her personal best time of 56.83 seconds, set at the 2011 Asian Athletics Championships in Kobe, was 0.17 seconds slower than the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for her event, the women's 400 metres hurdles. Before the Olympics Merrill said her target was to reach the semi-finals by pacing herself; although she was aware of the difficulty doing so, she would work hard to achieve her objective. She competed in the fifth heat of the first round on 5 August, finishing ninth (and last) of all athletes, with a time of 57.15 seconds. Merrill finished behind Déborah Rodríguez of Uruguay (57.04 seconds) and Brazil's Jailma de Lima in a heat led by Perri Shakes-Drayton from Great Britain (54.62 seconds). Overall, she finished 30th out of 41 runners, and did not advance to the semi-finals because she was 1.35 seconds slower than the slowest athlete in her heat who made the later stages. After completing her heat, Merrill wrote on Facebook that her day was one she would not forget and thanked everyone for sharing the moment with her: [...] "The roar of the crowd (was) so loud <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> heart echo. The bounce of the rock-hard track. The feeling of the Olympic Spirit." ...|$|E

2500|$|In July 2001, Keaton {{revealed}} {{her thoughts}} on being older and unmarried: [...] "I don't {{think that because}} I'm not married <b>it's</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> life any less. That old maid myth is garbage." [...] Keaton has two adopted children, daughter Dexter (adopted 1996) and son Duke (2001). Her father's death made mortality more apparent to her, and she {{decided to become a}} mother at age 50. She later said of having children, [...] "Motherhood has completely changed me. It's just about the most completely humbling experience that I've ever had." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did you ever, Ruth?" [...] Hesba Powlett exclaimed as {{the door}} closed. [...] "I never did hear such a story in all my life. And {{to think of her}} {{shooting}} four men! <b>It</b> quite <b>made</b> <b>my</b> flesh creep; didn't it yours?" ...|$|R
60|$|His brief {{answer was}} so scornful that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> question, natural though it was, seem absurd. I {{reflected}} {{for a minute}} or two.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, no, {{of course}} no. The dust was only from another swarm of those hateful Saracens. I {{knew it would}} be so. Pah! <b>it</b> has <b>made</b> <b>my</b> tongue more like old boot leather than ever. Have no more drops been {{squeezed}} from the well? It's time the cup was filled!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad ye say so; for yer see I didn't know {{at first}} how you'd tumble to my doing <b>it,</b> until I'd <b>made</b> <b>my</b> pile. And ef I hadn't <b>made</b> <b>it,</b> I wouldn't hev {{set eyes on}} ye agin, old pard--never!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Terence, {{suddenly}} growing serious, [...] "it {{was a dream}} or {{some kind}} of an hallucination. Nobody believes in spirits, these days. If you told the tale out of kindness of heart, Mrs. Bellmore, I can't express how grateful I am to you. <b>It</b> has <b>made</b> <b>my</b> mother supremely happy. That Revolutionary ancestor was a stunning idea." ...|$|R
60|$|At first I {{took the}} world of fact as being exactly as I {{perceived}} it. I believed my eyes. Seeing was believing, I thought. Still more did I believe my reasoning.

6000|$|... "They torture some of 'em," [...] replied Henry. [...] "I've seen a negro whipped till <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> blood boil. Of {{course the}} {{majority}} of 'em are treated fairly good." ...|$|E

6000|$|CHR. This is brave! Now I {{see that}} there was {{something}} to be learnt by our being pardoned by word and deed. Good Mercy, let us labor to keep this in mind; and, my children, do you remember it also.

6000|$|... "But I like it, Matteo; and see {{how strong}} <b>it</b> has <b>made</b> <b>my</b> muscles, not of the arm only, but the leg and back.

Besides, it is delightful, when you are {{accustomed}} to it, to feel the gondola flying away under your stroke." ...|$|R
60|$|Outside, Miss Sellars {{agreed that}} my presentiment had proved correct--that I had not shone to advantage. Our journey {{home on a}} tramcar was a {{somewhat}} silent proceeding.
