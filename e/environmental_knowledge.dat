This paper proposes a method to apply ontology approach in product design. During product reliability design and analysis, <b>environmental</b> effects <b>knowledge</b> reusing is achieved. First, the relationship of environmental effects and product reliability is analyzed. Then environmental effects ontology to describe <b>environmental</b> effects domain <b>knowledge</b> is designed. Related concepts of environmental effects are formally defined by using the ontology approach. This model {{can be applied to}} arrange <b>environmental</b> effects <b>knowledge</b> in different environments. Finally, rubber seals used in the subhumid acid rain environment are taken as an example to illustrate ontological model application on reliability design and analysis...|$|R
40|$|An {{increased}} interest in environmental concern has been embraced within the consumer market, particularly in the apparel market. As such, environmentally friendly clothing items are becoming more prevalent in the mainstream consumer market. In order to better understand factors relating to environmental concern and <b>environmental</b> apparel <b>knowledge,</b> this study compared students’ environmental orientation and <b>environmental</b> apparel <b>knowledge</b> depending on college major and gender, and identified attitudes and perceptions of environmentally friendly clothing at a university located in the Midwestern area in the United States. Results indicated that some majors, particularly those grouped as Environmentally Related majors differed from other major groups. Gender was found {{not to make a}} difference in either environmental orientation or <b>environmental</b> apparel <b>knowledge</b> in this study. Attitudes and perceptions about environmental friendly clothing were evaluated. In addition, some attitudes and perceptions were found to be correlated with scores relating to environmental orientation and apparel knowledge. Department of Family and Consumer SciencesThesis (M.

Using a numerical analysis performed with the hybrid integrated assessment model WITCH, extended to include mutual spillovers between the energy and the non-energy sector, we show that the combination between <b>environmental</b> and <b>knowledge</b> externalities provides a strong rationale for implementing a portfolio of policies for both emissions reduction and the internalisation of knowledge externalities. Moreover, we show that implementing technology policy {{as a substitute for}} stabilisation policy is likely to increase global emissions. technical change, climate change, development, innovation, spillovers...|$|R

40|$|Incorporating {{spirituality and}} {{religious}} themes {{in environmental education}} {{is a way to}} link learners to their meaning systems. Research has shown that incorporation of a spiritual element in educationprovides a way for students to have authentic learning experiences and make meaning of the knowledge they acquire in the classroom. This mixed methods study examined the <b>environmental</b> attitudes, <b>knowledge</b> and actions of students in an introductory environmental science course with a spiritually infused curriculum at a community college. The quantitative data was collected from students in a survey of <b>environmental</b> attitudes, <b>knowledge,</b> and actions. Qualitative studies were conducted using a focus group to complement the quantitative data. <b>Environmental</b> education increases <b>knowledge</b> and awareness about earth’s environment and teaches skills that lead toaction that will ensure stewardship of all aspects of earth’s environment. Integration of spirituality and religious traditions in environmental education offers an alternative approach in curriculumdesign that encourages learners’ environmental attitudes and behaviors to be transformed...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to investigate the effects of Multiple Intelligences strategy and traditional methods of instruction on elementary students’ <b>environmental</b> awareness <b>knowledge</b> levels and their attitudes towards the environment. The pre/post-test controlgroup research model was used in this study. The research was carried out in 2009 – 2010 education-instruction year in an elementary school in Nigde, Turkiye. Totally 60 students in two different classes in the 7 th grade of this school participated in the study. The data obtained in the study were analysed by the computer programme SPSS 15. 0. The arithmetic means and standard deviations were calculated for each group. In order to test the significance between the groups, the t-test was used. The significance level was taken as. 05. The results of {{the research}} showed {{a significant difference between the}} <b>environmental</b> awareness <b>knowledge</b> levels and attitude scores of the experiment groupand the control group. It was also found out that the multiple intelligences instructional strategy activities were more effective in the positive development of the students’ attitudes and their <b>environmental</b> awareness <b>knowledge</b> levels. At the end of the research,it is revealed that the students who are educated by Multiple Intelligences instructional strategy have more <b>environmental</b> awareness <b>knowledge</b> levels and have a higher motivation level than the students who are educated by the traditional methods ofinstruction. It was also found out that the students participated in the experimental process which multiple intelligences strategy was applied enjoyed the activities, had great fun and they became more aware of the environmental issues...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} important {{associations between}} <b>environmental</b> values, <b>knowledge,</b> concern and attitudes about water conservation policies {{in a desert}} metropolis. Specifically, we consider: (a) the combined influence of <b>environmental</b> value orientation, <b>knowledge</b> of drought conditions and concern about water use on support for water conservation policies; (b) the relative association of each individual variable on policy support; (c) factors explaining support to increase water prices and restrict water use; and (d) associations between socio-demographic factors and water policy support. Based on data from the 2009 Las Vegas Metropolitan Area Social Survey, we find that <b>environmental</b> value orientation, <b>knowledge</b> and concern are all significant predictors of water conservation, but concern stands out as the primary predictor for water policy support. Knowledge of drought conditions is the strongest predictor of support for water price increases, while concern predicts support for water use restrictions. We discuss theoretical implications and offer suggestions for water management, conservation and outreach...|$|R

This research is classified survey-correlational. The independent variables are: <b>knowledge</b> of <b>environmental</b> pollution (X 1), environmental attitudes (X 2) and locus of control (X 3) and the dependent variable is the behavior of the community in maintaining settlements environment sustainably (Y).
