In the following stages, the rear develops a fork, the longitudinal lines become green, and the larva itself becomes green. The mature larva is green and about 28mm long. The feeding habits for the larva extend from winter through early spring. It feeds on grasses like slender tussock grass, kangaroo grass, and false brome.|$|E

It prefers shallow, murky environments with soft bottoms, and tends to roam within a fairly localised area. With its bulky <b>grey</b> <b>body,</b> small eyes, and short, blunt snout, the pigeye shark looks almost identical to (and is often confused with) the better-known bull shark (C. leucas).

[...] The Rock Island had rival builder EMD repower their newest, the #621, but this doesn't seem to have extended its career greatly. [...] One notable pair on the Milwaukee Road lived charmed lives. Units #14A, B were delivered in October 1941, and paired up to run the Chicago-Minneapolis Afternoon Hiawatha and overnight Fast Mail back to Chicago. The units, along with EMD E6 #15A, B performed wonderfully during World War II with consists of Hiawathas expanding up to 20 cars and standing room only. The paint scheme was designed by Otto Kuhler, who had designed most of the 1938 Hiawatha and Milwaukee Road class F7 'Baltic' or 'Hudson' 4-6-4 locomotives. It had a yellow stripe up the nose and torpedo flank orange belts on the mostly <b>grey</b> <b>body.</b> This scheme did not last, and it was painted to resemble the other passenger unit EMD E6, #15A, B with the lightning bolt/grey scheme. After the War, they were repainted into the FM Erie-built locomotive scheme, and then in 1950, the Hiawatha orange-maroon band with black roof scheme.|$|E
