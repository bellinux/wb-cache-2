25|$|It {{has thus}} been claimed that Kripke's system indeed leads to contradiction: while its truth {{predicate}} is only partial, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>give</b> truth value (true/false) to propositions {{such as the}} one built in Tarski's proof, and is therefore inconsistent. While there is still a debate on whether Tarski's proof can be implemented to every similar partial truth system, none {{have been shown to be}} consistent by acceptable methods used in mathematical logic.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the arrest}} power {{is meant to}} ensure the defendant's {{presence}} in court, lawyers defending the white-collar criminals who have been perp-walked since the late 1980s have complained it is unnecessary and superfluous in their clients' cases, even if <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>give</b> the appearance of preferential treatment for wealthy defendants. Lea Fastow, the wife of former Enron executive Andrew Fastow, cited the perp walk she was made to take {{even though she had}} expressed her willingness to surrender to a summons in an unsuccessful motion for a change of venue. Some, like Martha Stewart, have still managed to avoid being perp-walked by responding to summonses, or surrendering in the courtroom as soon as the indictment is presented in open court.|$|E

Tom Breihan, a writer from Pitchfork Media, commented that in [...] "its brief onslaught of sneery fun, Vicki Leekx only occasionally reaches the dizzy pop heights of Arular and Kala.

In the series, Ortiz plays Marisol Duarte, a newly hired maid who is determined {{to find out who}} framed her son for the murder of a maid. Ironically, it was revealed in the series' seventh episode [...] "Taking a Message" [...] that Marisol's true identity was that of a professor and her real last name was Suarez.

60|$|I {{will not}} dwell upon the {{particulars}} of the proportional representation system here. There exists an active society which has organised {{the education of the}} public in the details of the proposal. Suffice it that <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>give</b> a method by which a voter may vote with confidence for the particular man he prefers, with no fear whatever that his vote will be wasted in the event of that man's chance being hopeless. There is a method by which the order of the voter's subsequent preference is effectively indicated. That is all, but see how completely it modifies the nature of an election. Instead of a hampered choice between two, you have a free choice between many. Such a change means a complete alteration in the quality of public life.|$|E
6000|$|This {{morning as}} ever was, bright and early up came the whole gang of them, {{a lot of}} sturdy, common-looking lads {{they seemed to be}} for the most part, and fell to on my new road. [...] Old Poe was in the highest of good spirits, and looked better in health than he has done any time in two years, being {{positively}} rejuvenated by the success of his scheme. He jested as he served out the new tools, and I am sorry to say damned the Government up hill and down dale, probably with a view to show off his position as a friend of the family before his work-boys. Now, whether or not their impulse will last them through the road does not matter to me one hair. [...] It is {{the fact that they have}} attempted it, that they have volunteered and are now really trying to execute a thing that was never before heard of in Samoa. Think of it! It is road-making - the most fruitful cause (after taxes) of all rebellions in Samoa, a thing to which they could not be wiled with money nor driven by punishment. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>give</b> me a sense of having done something in Samoa after all.|$|E

6000|$|Now <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>give</b> me {{real pain}} {{to speak in}} this almost unappreciative way of the old masters and their martyrs, because good friends of mine in the ship--friends who do {{thoroughly}} and conscientiously appreciate them and are in every way competent to discriminate between good pictures and inferior ones--have urged me for my own sake not to make public the fact that I lack this appreciation and this critical discrimination myself. I believe that what I have written and may still write about pictures will give them pain, and I am honestly sorry for it. I even promised that I would hide my uncouth sentiments in my own breast. But alas! I never could keep a promise. I do not blame myself for this weakness, because the fault must lie in my physical organization. It is likely that such a very liberal amount of space {{was given to the}} organ which enables me to make promises, that the organ which should enable me to keep them was crowded out. But I grieve not. I like no half-way things. I had rather have one faculty nobly developed than two faculties of mere ordinary capacity. I certainly meant to keep that promise, but I find I can not do it. It is impossible to travel through Italy without speaking of pictures, and can I see them through others' eyes? ...|$|E

We're talking of good innocent people deeply worked upon by a horrid discovery, and going much further, in their view of the lurid, as such people almost always do, than those who have been wider awake, all round, from the first. What I was to have got from my friend, in such a view, in exchange for what I had been able to do for him--well, that would have been an equivalent, of a kind best known to myself, for me shrewdly to consider." [...] And she easily lost herself, each time, in the anxious satisfaction of filling out the picture. [...] "It would have been seen, it would have been heard of, before, the case of the woman a man doesn't want, or of whom he's tired, or for whom he has no use but SUCH uses, and who is capable, in her infatuation, in her passion, of promoting his interests with other women rather than lose sight of him, lose touch of him, cease to have to do with him at all. Cela s'est vu, my dear; and stranger things still--as I needn't tell YOU! Very good then," [...] she wound up; [...] "there is a perfectly possible conception of the behaviour of your sweet wife; since, as I say, there's no imagination so lively, once it's started, as that of really agitated lambs. Lions are nothing to them, for lions are sophisticated, are blases, are brought up, from the first, to prowling and mauling. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>give</b> us, you'll admit, something to think about.

60|$|The {{meaning of}} {{representative}} government is, {{that the whole}} people, or some numerous portion of them, exercise through deputies periodically elected by themselves the ultimate controlling power, which, in every constitution, must reside somewhere. This ultimate power they must possess in all its completeness. They must be masters, whenever they please, of all the operations of government. There is no need that the constitutional law should itself give them this mastery. It does not in the British Constitution. But what <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>give</b> practically amounts to this: the power of final control is as essentially single, in a mixed and balanced government, as in a pure monarchy or democracy. This is the portion of truth {{in the opinion of}} the ancients, revived by great authorities in our own time, that a balanced constitution is impossible. There is almost always a balance, but the scales never hang exactly even. Which of them preponderates is not always apparent {{on the face of the}} political institutions. In the British Constitution, each of the three co-ordinate members of the sovereignty is invested with powers which, if fully exercised, would enable it to stop all the machinery of government. Nominally, therefore, each is invested with equal power of thwarting and obstructing the others; and if, by exerting that power, any of the three could hope to better its position, the ordinary course of human affairs forbids us to doubt that the power would be exercised. There can be no question that the full powers of each would be employed defensively if it found itself assailed by one or both of the others. What, then, prevents the same powers from being exerted aggressively? The unwritten maxims of the Constitution--in other words, the positive political morality of the country; and this positive political morality is what we must look to if we would know in whom the really supreme power in the Constitution resides.|$|E
