The code was entered on a keyboard which had just five piano type keys, operated with two fingers of the left hand and three fingers of the right hand. Once the keys had been pressed they were locked down until mechanical contacts in a <b>distributor</b> <b>unit</b> passed over the sector connected to that particular keyboard, when the keyboard was unlocked {{ready for the next}} character to be entered, with an audible click (known as the [...] "cadence signal") to warn the operator. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.|$|E
40|$|Background: The Ministry of Health has {{a special}} {{guidance}} for increasing the utilization of generic drugs in governmental health facilities. Beside, The Ministry of Health also has regulation for writing a generic drugs prescription at governmental hospital (permenkes RI No. 085 /Menkes/Per/I/ 1989). This regulation push the doctors in governmental hospital to write prescription on generic and essential drugs, for the patient treatment. The objective {{of this research was}} getting information about the availability of generic and essential drugs in governmental health facilities as well as private health facilities upon same district and cities in Indonesia. Methods: This research has been conducted in July to December 2006, using the cross sectional research design. Location selected consist of three areas, there were archipelagoes, wide continent and development area. A purposive sample has been selected, there were 10 <b>distributor</b> <b>unit,</b> 10 govermental hospitals, 20 primary health centers (puskesmas), and 20 dispensaries, as well as 10 drugstores. The method of data collection were interviewed using structure question instrument, prescription observation in hospital, primary health centers, and dispensaries, private dispensaries in hospital, drugstore as well. Results: A descriptive analyzed has been done to get some tables presenting as result. The results show that the range of availability of generic drugs in primary health centers 84. 89 – 100 % (x¯ = 95. 4 %), in governmental hospital 11. 29 – 95. 65 %) (x¯ = 51. 44 %) and in dispensaries 1. 97 – 66. 6 % (x¯ = 18. 73 %). Generic medicine prescription in primary health centers 91. 60 – 100 % (x¯ = 98. 82 %) while the essential medicine prescription in primary health centers 92. 83 – 100 % (x¯ = 97. 22 %). The range of generic medicine prescription in governmental hospital is 14. 58 – 100 % (x¯ = 55. 38 %), and essential medicine prescription in governmental hospital 52. 30 – 91. 75 % (x¯ = 69. 93 %). In dispensaries generic medicine prescription have range 2. 63 % - 80. 20 % (x¯ = 26. 24 %), while the essential medicine prescription in dispensary 46. 85 – 78. 88 % (x¯ = 52. 74 %). Due to those results, the suggestion are to develop Rational Drug Use Training in hospital and private clinic continuely. Besides advocation to distric health office (Dinkes Kab/kota) to implement utilization generic and essential medicine and also activation of Pharmacy and Therapy Commission to monitoring and evaluating rational drug use.   Key words: generic medicine, essential medicine, primary health care, governmental hospital, dispensary, drugstore</p...|$|E

40|$|The hydrodynamics of gas-liquid {{apparatus}} - bubble columns, airlifts, … - {{is strongly}} affected by liquid properties {{as well as}} by reactor design and operating conditions. The present contribute reports on the effects of the liquid features on the hydrodynamics of gas-liquid apparatus. In particular, the effects of viscosity - Newtonian fluid – and of relaxation time – non-Newtonian fluid – were separately addressed in bubble columns (BCs). The experimental apparatus consisted of two lab scale BCs. The first BC was characterized by square cross section and was equipped with a single needle gas distributor to inject single bubbles and chains of bubbles. The second BC was characterized by circular cross section and was equipped with needles gas <b>distributor.</b> The <b>units</b> were equipped with gas flow controller, humidifier, diagnostic instrumentation, data acquisition unit, and a high-speed digital camera. The liquids investigated were: a) distilled water; b) aqueous solutions of sodium alginate; c) aqueous solutions of glycerol; d) aqueous solutions of glycerol and polyethylene oxide. The alginate solutions and glycerol solution are Newtonian fluids, the solutions d) are constant-viscosity elastic fluids (Boger fluids). Results highlighted the hydrodynamics of single- or chain-bubbles in Boger fluids as well as the behaviour of fully developed two-phase flow in BC...|$|R
40|$|This paper, {{by drawing}} upon {{accountability}} theories, aims {{to explore and}} examine practices related to discharging economic and legal accountability in Malaysian unit trust industry. The evidence was primarily constructed from two main sources, documentary review and in-depth interviews. Document review was undertaken on various documents issued by the industry regulators and industry players. Meanwhile, semi-structured interviews were carried out with representative from the regulators, unit trust management companies (UTMCs), a <b>unit</b> trust <b>distributor</b> company, and <b>unit</b> trust advisors. Evidence suggests that economic and legal accountability, which are commonly exercised {{as a form of}} external oversight and control, has been dominated the industry, for example, via the issuance and enforcement of various rules, acts, regulations, and guidelines over the industry players. While economic and legal accountability, which typically prioritized a limited range of influential stakeholders, are important and crucial for investors’ protection and in developing a sound unit trust industry, too much emphasis, may cause other stakeholders affected – directly or indirectly- by UTMCs activities left unconsidered or received inadequate attention...|$|R
5000|$|Various {{crankshaft}} vibration problems [...] dogged {{the engine}} from the start, and to compound matters quick-fix balancing weights {{attached to the}} crankshafts developed the unfortunate habit of detaching themselves and flying off within the engines causing several catastrophic engine failures. Each side of the engine had {{to have its own}} water radiator, fuel metering <b>unit,</b> <b>distributor</b> and water pump, with a common oil radiator. The sheer complexity of the engine led to a truly terrible record of unreliability; engine, transmission and related problems caused 27 of the powerplant's 30 retirements from 40 entries. Jackie Stewart said of the engine [...] "it was unnecessarily large, used more fuel, carried more oil and needed more water - all of which added weight and diminished the vehicle's agility"The initial 32 valve engine produced 395 horsepower at 10,250 RPM, with a later 64 valve variant raising this to 420 hp at 10,500 RPM. While these constituted reasonable figures compared to the Ferrari, Honda and Weslake V12s and the Cosworth V8 of 1967, the H16 had an extremely narrow power band and was by some distance the heaviest engine on the grid, starting out weighing 555 lb when introduced in 1966 with the final lightweight version lowering this to 398 lb.|$|R
40|$|During summer 2007 a 2 - 4 MWth {{indirect}} gasification {{section was}} {{integrated into the}} loop of the existing 8 - 12 MWth circulating fluidized bed boiler at Chalmers University. With help of a particle <b>distributor</b> the gasification <b>unit</b> {{is connected to the}} loop after the cyclone. Hot bed material entrained from the boiler is so transferred to the gasifier providing the heat for the production of a nearly nitrogen free product gas. Non gasified char is returned together with the bed material into the boiler and converted. Biomass can be fed into both sections; the boiler and the gasifier. The gasification is separated from the boiler via two loop seals and a particle distributer, directing particles either back to the boiler or into the gasification section. For that reason the CFB boiler can be operated even after the retrofit independently, just like before, or in combined combustion/gasification mode. This possibility keeps the risk for a retrofit low. As, furthermore, the investment costs for the integration are considerably lower than standalone gasification units of that size, the retrofit is an easy way to extend the potential of a CFB Boiler towards bi- and tri generation (heat, power, fuel) and enter new markets. The first experimental season with the installation proved stable operation of both the boiler and the gasification. Furthermore, the full functionality in combustion only mode was shown. The gasifier was operated for 60 h with wood pellets and wood chips. First analysis of the producer gas composition shows high contents of methane, making the installation a good match for SNG production. The heating value of the gas is about 14, 4 MJ/nm 3...|$|R
5000|$|According to IDW, {{the first}} issue had reached over 90,000 pre-orders by October 2012 and {{exceeded}} 100,000 just before its release; most single issues of comics do not see sales in excess of 10,000 to 12,000, particularly for publishers other than DC Comics or Marvel, according to Price. In light of this number, IDW announced plans to run a second printing of the first comic along with the collectible box set in December, and ultimately ended up reprinting the issue four times. The large number of pre-orders for an all-ages comic has been considered a boom for the comics industry; the pre-order numbers exceeded those for other, more traditional comics like DC's The New 52 and Marvel NOW! relaunches, putting it on track {{to be one of}} the best-selling issues for 2012. As many of the purchasers of these comics are likely to be first-time comic buyers, the comic's success may also filter to improved sales of other comic titles. Total sales of the standalone first issue, as tracked by Diamond Comic <b>Distributors,</b> exceeded 80,000 <b>units,</b> making it the fifteen best comic for the month and an uncommon occurrence of a non-DC, non-Marvel comic breaking the top 20, according to Russ Burlingane of Comicbook.com. The first issue of Friendship Is Magic was one of only two non-DC/Marvel publications (the other being The Walking Dead #100) to be in the top 100 issue quantity sales for 2012, ranked at #90, and ranked #61 based on revenue. According to Heather Nuhfer and Amy Mebberson, {{the first issue}} of the comic is the best-selling issue published by IDW as of March 2013. John Mayo of Comic Book Resources points out that even with lower sales figures, the 7th issue of the comic sold more than three times the number of copies of the combined Star Trek and Doctor Who IDW-licensed and fan-heavy series, and believes that [...] "whatever IDW is doing to promote My Little Pony is working". The success of My Little Pony and other children's comics like Adventure Time help to boosting overall sales in the comics industry by 15% in 2012.|$|R
