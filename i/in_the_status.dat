5|$|Another {{war with}} Russia {{followed}} in 1632 and was concluded without much change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> quo. King Władysław IV {{then proceeded to}} recover the lands lost to Sweden. At {{the conclusion of the}} hostilities, Sweden evacuated the cities and ports of Royal Prussia but kept most of Livonia. Courland, which had remained with the Commonwealth, assumed the servicing of Lithuania's Baltic trade. After Frederick William's last Prussian homage before the Polish king in 1641, the Commonwealth's position in regard to Prussia and its Hohenzollern rulers kept getting weaker.|$|E
5|$|Allgame gave {{positive}} {{reviews of}} the game. It said that game includes everything from hidden items, simplistic gameplay, fun and replay value, and basic but good-looking graphics. Defunct Games called Wonder Boy in Monster Land the most challenging game in the Wonder Boy series, noting the lack of passwords or continues in the Master System version, the relatively few chances to earn extra lives, and a time limit. The review said {{that the ability to}} earn gold and upgrade equipment which are laid out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> screen tremendously adds to the replay value. It praised the responsive, though sometimes not precise, controls and the tight hit detection. Moreover, it said that the graphics were colorful and that it complemented the music and its simplistic sound effects well. Overall, the review said that the game is recommended for Master System and platforming fans alike.|$|E
5|$|From 1809 to 1898, {{a period}} called Pax Russica, the {{peripheral}} {{power of the}} Finns gradually increased, and the Russian-Finnish relations were exceptionally peaceful compared with {{other parts of the}} Russian Empire. Russia's defeat in the Crimean War in the 1850s led to attempts to speed up the modernization of the country. This caused more than 50 years of economic, industrial, cultural and educational progress in the Grand Duchy of Finland, including improvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> of the Finnish language. All this encouraged Finnish nationalism and cultural unity through the birth of the Fennoman movement, which bound the Finns to the domestic governmental system and led to the idea that the Finnish Grand Duchy was an increasingly autonomous state of the Russian Empire.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the first}} award of the GC to an Australian in 1942 {{and the final}} bestowal to Constable Michael Kenneth Pratt in 1978, 14 Australians were {{directly}} decorated with the medal. Of these, nine were awarded to military personnel and five to civilians. Eight of the medals were awarded posthumously. At {{the time of the}} institution of the GC, living recipients of the Empire Gallantry Medal automatically became recipients of the new award, and were required to return their previous medal; two Australians became GC holders through this method. In 1971, the British Government announced that living recipients of the Albert Medal and Edward Medal would henceforth be recipients of the GC with the option of exchanging their insignia for that of the GC. The decision for such an action {{was the result of the}} decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> and significance of the two awards, leading recipients to feel they were not receiving the recognition they were due. Of the 27 Australian holders of the Albert Medal, six were living at the time and all opted to exchange their insignia for the GC. None of the eight Australians awarded the Edward Medal were alive in 1971, and thus no Australian became a recipient of the GC through this exchange. Including exchange awards, a total of 22 Australians were decorated with the GC.|$|E
25|$|The CPU recognizes seven {{interrupt}} levels. Levels 1 through 5 {{are strictly}} prioritized. That is, a higher-numbered interrupt can always interrupt a lower-numbered interrupt. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> register, a privileged instruction {{allows one to}} set the current minimum interrupt level, blocking lower or equal priority interrupts. For example, if the interrupt level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> register is set to 3, higher levels from 4 to 7 can cause an exception. Level 7 is a level triggered Non-maskable interrupt (NMI). Level 1 can be interrupted by any higher level. Level 0 means no interrupt. The level is stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> register, and is visible to user-level programs.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} Jews {{migrating}} {{to the land}} of Israel rose significantly between the 13th and 19th centuries, mainly due to a general decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> of Jews across Europe and an increase in religious persecution. The expulsion of Jews from England (1290), France (1391), Austria (1421), and Spain (the Alhambra decree of 1492) were seen by many as a sign of approaching redemption and contributed greatly to the messianic spirit of the time.|$|E
