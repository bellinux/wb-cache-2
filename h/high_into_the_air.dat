5|$|On 16 October 1984, B-52G 57-6479, {{assigned}} to the 92d Bomb Wing, Fairchild AFB, Washington, clipped its wing on Hunts Mesa, an outcropping in Monument Valley, Arizona, and crashed, sending a fireball <b>high</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Two of the seven crew perished in the crash, including Col. William Ivy, the wing's deputy commander for operations.|$|E
5|$|Back at the Alley, Sing {{undergoes}} a transformation {{brought on by}} the Beast's attack, fully healing himself and making him a kung-fu master himself. He sees to the well-being of the Landlords as the Gang arrives. Sing easily defeats the Gang and faces the Beast alone. The Beast uses his Toad style maneuvers to launch Sing <b>high</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> While aloft, Sing comes to peace with Buddha, and is able to use the Buddhist Palm method to subdue the Beast. The Beast accepts his defeat and asks Sing to be his master.|$|E
5|$|Immense {{quantities}} {{of dust and}} coal rose <b>high</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> in an inverted cone...In the village of Heworth, this cloud caused a darkness like that of early twilight and covered the roads so thickly that the footsteps of passengers were deeply imprinted in it. As soon as the explosion was heard, wives and children of the workmen ran to the pit. Wildness and terror were pictured in every countenance. The crowd soon collected to several hundreds, some crying out for a husband, others for a parent or a son, and all affected by a mixture of horror, anxiety and grief.|$|E
60|$|Usanga, all {{unconscious}} of {{what was}} going on behind him, drove the plane <b>higher</b> and <b>higher</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
60|$|Where were we to go next? <b>Into</b> <b>the</b> far west, {{to see how}} all the {{way along}} the railroads the new rocks and soils lie above the older, and yet how, when we get westward, the oldest rocks rise <b>highest</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
50|$|Taller {{players are}} often {{thought to have}} an {{advantage}} in basketball because their shots have less distance {{to travel to the}} basket, they start out closer to the rebound, and their ability to reach <b>higher</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> yields a better chance of blocking shorter players' shots.|$|R
5|$|In late 1984, geologists {{noticed that}} seismic {{activity}} in the area had begun to increase. Increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and phreatic eruptions also alerted geologists to the possibility of an eruption. Phreatic events, when rising magma encounters water, continued well into September 1985 (one major event took place on September 11, 1985), shooting steam <b>high</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Activity began to decline in October, probably because the new magma had finished ascending into Nevado del Ruiz's volcanic edifice.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} at Miami International Airport {{was partly}} {{shot at the}} Dunsfold Aerodrome, in Surrey, which is known from British car show Top Gear, with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports. In filming the scene in which the engine thrust of the moving aircraft blows the police car <b>high</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to move it up and backwards {{at the moment of}} full extension away from the plane.|$|E
5|$|Because males emerge {{earlier than}} females, the males compete for mating territories {{surrounding}} the nests {{in which the}} females are located. During a fight, the males risk damaging their wings or appendages by butting and grappling. Another defense technique is to grab another male and carry it <b>high</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> which {{is thought to be}} a demonstration of strength. As a general rule, the larger the male the more predominant he is in battles. Age influences the success in the defense and security of territory; the younger the wasp the greater the chance of a successful takeover of territory. Some small males even engage in non-territorial mating tactics, and delay their emergence so as to have a fairer chance of survival.|$|E
500|$|These massive eruptive columns are the {{distinctive}} feature of a Plinian eruption, and reach up [...] <b>into</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere. The densest {{part of the}} plume, directly above the volcano, is driven internally by gas expansion. As it reaches <b>higher</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>the</b> plume expands and becomes less dense, convection and thermal expansion of volcanic ash drive it even further up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stratosphere. At {{the top of the}} plume, powerful prevailing winds drive the plume in a direction away from the volcano.|$|R
60|$|Then, ruffling his crest angrily, Policeman Blue Jay flew {{to attack}} the big white robber, and was {{astonished}} to find he could not catch it. For the white bird flew <b>higher</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> than he could, and also flew much faster, so that it soon escaped and passed out of sight.|$|R
50|$|These massive eruptive columns are the {{distinctive}} feature of a Plinian eruption, and reach up 2 to 45 km <b>into</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere.

5|$|Ferdinand ordered 400 men {{to enter}} the saps; these men would storm the castle once the mine had been detonated. The {{remainder}} of his cavalry and foot soldiers were {{to wait in the}} fields below. Some sources assert that the fuse was lit at around 1:00 pm, although the 19th-century local historian Heinrich Joseph Flo√ü argued that these sources are mistaken, and that the explosion clearly occurred in the morning. All sources agree that the explosion, with a dreadful crack, propelled chunks of the towers and walls <b>high</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Almost half the Godesburg collapsed instantly. According to a newspaper report dated 13 January 1584, debris raining on the valley below damaged several houses, and destroyed some of them completely.|$|E
5|$|In a {{situation}} with more time, Virginia Tech would have kicked the ball off to Florida State and {{hoped for a}} defensive stop to give the offense {{a chance for a}} game-winning drive. With less than twominutes remaining, however, and with Virginia Tech having used all its timeouts, the only chance for the Hokies was to attempt a difficult onside kick. A successful recovery would give the Hokies another chance on offense. Kicker Brandon Pace teed up the ball, and kicked it forwards, bouncing the ball <b>high</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> to create a jump ball situation. Virginia Tech's Xavier Adibi recovered the ball, but because the kick had only traveled nineyards before the recovery, the ball was awarded to Florida State. NCAA rules state that an onside kick must travel at least 10yards before the kicking team can legally touch the ball, and Pace's kick had not traveled the requisite distance.|$|E
5|$|Langsdorff {{was unwilling}} to risk {{the lives of his}} crew, so he decided to scuttle the ship. He knew that {{although}} Uruguay was neutral, the government was on friendly terms with Britain and if he allowed his ship to be interned, the Uruguayan Navy would allow British intelligence officers access to the ship. Under Article 17 of the Hague Convention, neutrality restrictions limited Admiral Graf Spee to a period of 72 hours for repairs in Montevideo, before she would be interned {{for the duration of the}} war. On 17 December 1939, Langsdorff ordered the destruction of all important equipment aboard the ship. The ship's remaining ammunition supply was dispersed throughout the ship, in preparation for scuttling. On 18 December, the ship, with only Langsdorff and 40 other men aboard, moved into the outer roadstead to be scuttled. A crowd of 20,000 watched as the scuttling charges were set; the crew was taken off by an Argentine tug and the ship was scuttled at 20:55. The multiple explosions from the munitions sent jets of flame <b>high</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and created a large cloud of smoke that obscured the ship which burned in the shallow water for the next two days.|$|E
60|$|Larger {{and larger}} grew the island, and {{although}} they were headed directly toward it, the umbrella seemed to rise <b>higher</b> and <b>higher</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>the</b> farther it traveled. They had not journeyed ten minutes before they came directly over the island, and looking down {{they could see the}} forests and meadows far below them. But the umbrella kept up its rapid flight.|$|R
5000|$|Dirt jumping - Dirt jumping (DJ), {{similar to}} freeride, it is a {{competition}} of skill, differing that {{it involves the}} rider to jump off mounds of dirt to perform the best tricks with the best style. It differs to freeriding that the jumps are usually much larger and designed to lift <b>the</b> rider <b>higher</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and <b>the</b> bicycle is different from its counterpart.|$|R
5000|$|In golf, a well-struck shot {{will result}} in a large amount of {{backspin}} that will carry <b>the</b> ball <b>higher</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and farther. Backspin also helps with distance control, as if there is enough backspin, the ball will [...] "check" [...] if it lands on the putting surface, and sometimes even creep backwards (in the opposite direction that the ball was flying) upon landing.|$|R
5|$|Rocket bombs, {{aerodynamic}} {{wings and}} explosive payloads: The first known rockets fitted with aerodynamic wings {{are described as}} the 'flying crows with magic fire' in the oldest strata of the Huolongjing (early-to-mid 14th century), compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen during the early Ming Dynasty (1368‚Äì1644). The body of the rocket was shaped like a bird (specifically a crow), packed with gunpowder, and made of bamboo laths forming a long basketwork frame that was reinforced with glued paper. A decorative head and tail were attached {{to the front and}} back ends, while the wings were nailed to the sides. Under each wing were two slanting rockets to propel the weapon; a main fuse was lit that ignited a fourfold fuse connected to each rocket and running through a drilled hole {{in the back of the}} bird. The book then claims that the rocket, after being launched <b>high</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and aimed at encampments or enemy boats, automatically produced an explosion upon impact that could be seen from considerably long distances.|$|E
5|$|The next day, a Nazi U-boat appears and {{intercepts}} the ship. Belloq and Dietrich {{seize the}} Ark and Marion but cannot locate Jones, who stows away aboard the U-boat and travels {{with them to}} {{an island in the}} Aegean Sea. Once there, Belloq plans to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to Hitler. Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy the Ark with a panzerfaust, but Belloq calls his bluff and Jones surrenders rather than destroy such an important historical artifact. The Nazis take Indy and Marion to an area where the Ark will be opened and tie them to a post to observe. Belloq performs a ceremonial opening of the Ark, which appears to contain nothing but sand, all that remains of the Ten Commandments. Suddenly, angelic ghost-like beings emerge from the Ark. Indy cautions Marion to keep her eyes closed and not to observe what happens next. Belloq and the others look on in astonishment as the apparitions are suddenly revealed to be angels of death. A vortex of flame forms above the Ark and shoots bolts of fiery energy into the gathered Nazi soldiers, killing them all. As Belloq, Toht and Dietrich all scream in terror, the Ark turns its fury on them: Dietrich's head shrivels up, Toht's face is melted off his skull and Belloq's head explodes. Flames then engulf the remains of the doomed assembly, save for Indy and Marion, and the pillar of fire rises into the sky. The Ark's lid is blasted <b>high</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> before dropping back down onto the Ark and sealing it. Jones and Marion find their ropes burned off and embrace.|$|E
25|$|Ball 5: 1 run, Grout hit {{the ball}} <b>high</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Hall dropped the catch, and another run resulted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then let's be careful," [...] remarked Files, who {{was full}} of wisdom; but Polychrome wanted to test {{the quality of the}} rubber, so she began dancing. Every step sent her <b>higher</b> and <b>higher</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> so that she resembled a big {{butterfly}} fluttering lightly. Presently she made a great bound and bounded way across the stream, landing lightly and steadily on the other side.|$|R
50|$|Dirt Jumping evolved {{alongside}} BMX {{racing and}} {{is similar to}} BMX or Mountain bike racing in that the rider jumps off of mounds of dirt. It differs in that the jumps are usually much larger and designed to lift <b>the</b> rider <b>higher</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Additionally, <b>the</b> {{goal is not to}} complete the course with the fastest time, but rather to perform the best tricks with the best style.|$|R
50|$|Soul Edge {{was created}} {{prior to the}} {{introduction}} of the so-called 8-Way Run. The characters can sidestep to either side by double-tapping down to move to the foreground or tapping down then up to the background. The jump maneuver (which in Soulcalibur is more like a hop) moves <b>the</b> player <b>higher</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> even allowing it to pass above the opponent (much like in Tekken). The game uses an active block system performed by pressing the block button, and a combat system based on the three attack buttons: horizontal attack, vertical attack, and kick.|$|R
25|$|The bomb is a kick {{that goes}} <b>high</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Both teams watch {{and wait for}} the ball to come down, and both teams usually having an equal chance at regathering it.|$|E
25|$|At about 10:15 on 26 April {{while the}} ship was at anchor off Punta Arenas, an {{explosion}} occurred in the forward magazine. Eyewitnesses described how objects of every type were thrown <b>high</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> and a huge column of smoke was seen {{to rise from the}} ship. The ship sank instantly.|$|E
25|$|A common {{occurrence}} in explosive eruptions is for column collapse to occur. In this case, the eruption column is too dense {{to be lifted}} <b>high</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> by air convection, and instead falls down the flanks of the volcano to form a pyroclastic flow or surge. On some occasions, if ash isn't dense enough to fall, it may create pyrocumulonimbus.|$|E
2500|$|Sagan and {{his colleagues}} {{expected}} that a [...] "self-lofting" [...] of the sooty smoke would occur when it absorbed the sun's heat radiation, with little to no scavenging occurring, whereby the black particles of soot would be heated by the sun and lifted/lofted <b>higher</b> and <b>higher</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> thereby injecting <b>the</b> soot <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stratosphere where it would take years for the sun blocking effect of this aerosol of soot {{to fall out of}} <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> and with that, catastrophic ground level cooling and agricultural impacts in Asia and possibly the Northern Hemisphere as a whole.|$|R
50|$|On the Game Boy Advance version, players {{increase}} their attributes via the X-Rage meter, where players {{fill up the}} meter by performing tricks, which later will cause a coin {{to appear on the}} halfpipe. After the player grabs the coin, they're flown <b>higher</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> and players are to perform a 10-trick combo. If the player successfully accomplishes this, gems will fall down onto the halfpipe, which players can collect. If players grab enough gems of a particular color, the skater the player is playing as will have his attributes raised in a specific section.|$|R
50|$|Weapon-jumping {{techniques}} {{requires the}} player jumps {{off the ground}} and, by using the proper weapon, immediately afterwards fires a bullet (rocket, grenade, plasma or BFG plasma) onto the spot on the floor exactly or very near beneath her/him. The damage of the resulting blast delivers momentum to the player's character and propels her/him <b>higher</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> than possible by regular jumping. The gain in momentum {{can be used for}} vertical, horizontal, and diagonal movement. In Q3A four weapons makes self-splash damage and can be combined with each other‚Äîrocket and grenade launcher, BFG10K and plasma gun.|$|R
25|$|Brennan Mulwray (Victor Webster) is an Elemental Electrical {{with the}} ability to {{generate}} enough electricity from his body to power a small city. He can also shoot powerful electrical bolts from his palms which, if fired downward, are capable of launching him <b>high</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> His primary weakness is water. Before Adam Kane found Mulwray, he was a thief. Mason Eckhart captured him and used him to hunt down the other New Mutants. However, Mulwray escaped and managed to join Mutant X along with Emma DeLauro.|$|E
25|$|A {{trampoline}} is a gymnastic {{and recreational}} device {{consisting of a}} piece of taut, strong fabric stretched over a steel frame using many coiled springs to provide a rebounding force which propels the jumper <b>high</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> In a trampoline, the fabric is not elastic itself; the elasticity is provided by the springs which connect it to the frame. While the trampoline is an old invention which relied on crude and flawed designs, the modern trampoline was invented by George Nissen and Larry Griswold around 1934.|$|E
25|$|On 22 November, Seahorse skillfully maneuvered {{past three}} enemy escorts, {{launched}} four torpedoes from periscope depth, and sank the cargo ship, Daishu Maru. On 26 November, the submarine contacted another enemy convoy {{and began to}} close the range. Determined to mount an attack before the targets entered the mined Tsushima Strait, the submarine launched four torpedoes at long range quickly sinking a cargo ship; and then, dodging enemy escorts, let go four stern shots at a second target. The results seemed disappointing‚Äîuntil a sudden blast sent flames and debris mushrooming <b>high</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> completely destroying the 7,309-ton tanker, San Ramon Maru.|$|E
50|$|When {{extended}} to higher numbers of props (five, seven, nine, etc.) the cascade maintains the basic pattern of throwing one prop before catching another {{on its way}} down. Higher numbers require the balls to be tossed <b>higher</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> {{in order to allow}} more time for a complete cycle of throws. However, {{in order to keep the}} number of props in the juggler's hands to a minimum, it is necessary to begin the pattern by throwing, from alternating hands, all but one prop (in the same hand as the first throw, which started with one more prop than the other) before any catches are made.|$|R
5000|$|In late October 2016, the ACTUV {{demonstrated}} another DARPA program, the Towed Airborne Lift of Naval Systems (TALONS), {{aimed at}} increasing ships' sensor capabilities by elevating them <b>higher</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> using a parachute. For two days for 90 minutes each day, TALONS was deployed from a [...] "nest" [...] {{installed on the}} back of the ACTUV vehicle, rising to 1000 ft while the ship maneuvered at [...] "operationally realistic speeds." [...] Compared to mast-mounted sensors sitting 150-200 ft above the waterline, the parasailing sensor array increased surface-track radar range by six times, doubled its EO/IR discrimination range, and more than tripled omnidirectional radio range.|$|R
50|$|Moorcroft is {{best known}} for winning the 2001 Mark of the Year, with a {{spectacular}} high-flying mark in round 14, 2001 against the Western Bulldogs, taking the mark over Bulldogs' forward Brad Johnson. The mark was particularly notable in that Moorcroft first jumped onto Johnson's back, then leapt <b>higher</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> by leveraging himself off Johnson; this is very rare, as players will usually jump onto their opponent's back, then appear to hang at the same height while taking the mark (hence the colloquial term hanger for such a mark). For a similar reason, Johnson {{is often referred to as}} the springboard for this mark, when the term stepladder is used for the player underneath a hanger.|$|R
