25|$|Harris {{wanted to}} join the United States Marine Corps, but his {{application}} was rejected shortly before the shootings because he was taking the drug fluvoxamine, an SSRI antidepressant, which he was required to take as part of court-ordered anger management therapy. According to the recruiting officer, Harris did not <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> rejection. Though some friends of Harris suggested that he had stopped taking the drug beforehand, the autopsy reports showed low therapeutic or normal (not toxic or lethal) blood-levels of Luvox (fluvoxamine) in his system, which would be around 0.0031-0.0087mg%, {{at the time of}} death. After the shootings, opponents of contemporary psychiatry like Peter Breggin claimed that the psychiatric medications prescribed to Harris after his conviction (ostensibly for obsessive-compulsive disorder) may have exacerbated his aggressiveness.|$|E

25|$|The fleet sailed {{further and}} further south, {{avoiding}} the Portuguese territories in Brazil, and become the first to reach Tierra del Fuego {{at the tip of}} the Americas. On October 21, starting in Cape Virgenes, they began an arduous trip through a 373-mile (600km) long strait that Magellan named Estrecho de Todos los Santos, the modern Strait of Magellan. On November 28, three ships entered the Pacific Ocean—then named Mar Pacífico because of its apparent stillness. The expedition managed to cross the Pacific. Magellan died in the battle of Mactan in the Philippines, leaving the Spaniard Juan Sebastián Elcano the task of completing the voyage, reaching the Spice Islands in 1521. On September 6, 1522 Victoria returned to Spain, thus completing the first circumnavigation of the globe. Of the men who set out on five ships, only 18 completed the circumnavigation and managed to return to Spain in this single vessel led by Elcano. Seventeen others arrived later in Spain: twelve captured by the Portuguese in Cape Verde some weeks earlier, and between 1525 and 1527, and five survivors of the Trinidad. Antonio Pigafetta, a Venetian scholar and traveller who had asked to be on board and become a strict assistant of Magellan, kept an accurate journal that become the main source for much of what we <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> voyage.|$|E

[...] He agreed that Roman numerals were ill-advised for the eagle, and on June 24, new models were sent to the Mint by Hering. [...] These models, along with a bronze casting which was produced privately, were used by Barber to prepare a die, and experimental pieces were struck on July 19. [...] These [...] "high relief" [...] pieces required multiple strikes of the press to fully bring up the design. [...] Saint-Gaudens wrote to the Mint in mid-July, [...] "I am waiting to <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> in order to proceed with the other reliefs", and he was sent one of the new pieces, along with a Liberty Head eagle for comparison, for which he paid by check.|$|E

A paralysed Tony comes backstage to visit him and talks about how far Jim's career has come. Jim broke up with Laura and has not seen her since his run in Macbeth. After Tony leaves, Kirstie arrives to see Jim. She is now Tony's full-time carer. She has watched Jim's performance {{every day of the}} week, and says she knew that he just needed [...] "a little push" [...] to achieve greatness. She tells him that Laura committed suicide by slitting her wrists in the dressing room's shower. Jim did not <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> because he was overseas filming a role in Game of Thrones at the time. He believes that Laura pushed Tony off the battlements and could not live with her guilt. Kirstie reveals that she herself is the one who pushed Tony, and spiked his juice with alcohol backstage. She also got Felicity sacked because Felicity would not let Jim perform as Macbeth. Kirstie is wearing the engagement ring that she took from Laura's corpse. She tells Jim that she is waiting for him [...] "in the wings ... like an understudy". She leaves, and as Jim prepares to go onstage, he sees bloody visions of Laura's death.|$|E
500|$|After Oakley and Weinstein left The Simpsons, {{they created}} Mission Hill in 1997, {{a show about}} a hip, lazy, 24-year-old {{cartoonist}} named Andy French, and sold it to The WB for a fall 1999 debut. They pitched the show in 1998 [...] "as an animated series for young adults with a sophisticated, Simpsons-style sensibility." [...] They aimed to make the show about realistic issues affecting young adults, which were too mature for The Simpsons. The network was impressed and initially ordered 13 episodes; they ordered five more once the first was completed. Oakley explained: [...] "The audience we're going for is one that's sophisticated, that likes high and low humor, that's very savvy in animation. [...] this show is definitely a case {{where a lot of}} people don't get it. It's not setup, setup, setup, punch line. It's observational humor. It's jokes told in a weird way, in the background or with a bizarre sound effect." [...] The show was plagued by [...] "public relations" [...] difficulties, which meant it was [...] "tarnished" [...] from the start. A badly edited two-minute promotional video for the show, sent to advertisers in April 1999 for the annual upfronts, was poorly received. Oakley and Weinstein had been informed that the upfronts did not matter. Similarly, because no episodes were finished in time, journalists were not able to see anything of the show at the network's schedule presentation in July. Subsequently, as Weinstein commented to the Washington Post, [...] "for seven months, the only impression people had of the show was based on a two-minute tape that looked terrible. Six major publications panned it before they even saw it." [...] The pilot garnered largely negative reviews from publications such as The Deseret News; and earned a positive write-up in Variety. Furthermore, the show was forced to change from its originally planned title of The Downtowners due to its closeness to an MTV show. All of these factors combined to ensure the show received little attention, and the WB ran only a few commercials for it. Weinstein stated: [...] "I don't know exactly why America doesn't <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> show. It's like Teen People came out with its fall preview, and we're not even in it." [...] Mission Hill came {{at a time when the}} TV schedules were already saturated with animated shows; some of the response could be chalked up to its genre.|$|E

The country's The Chronicle {{newspaper}} wrote: [...] "It {{is not an}} overstatement {{that almost}} 99.99 percent of Zimbabweans didn’t <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> animal until Monday. Now we have just learnt, thanks to the British media, that we had Africa’s most famous lion all along, an icon!" [...] The BBC's Farai Sevenzo wrote: [...] "The lion's death has not registered much with the locals". [...] At the same time, Zimbabwean officials stated that the killing of Cecil had already caused a decrease of tourism revenues. A significant decrease was noted in Hwange, where the lion had lived. Many international tourists, who had planned to see the lion, had cancelled their trips. [...] "This killing is a huge loss to our tourism sector that was contributing immensely to the national wealth", said Emanuel Fundira, {{the president of the}} Safari Operators Association of Zimbabwe. [...] "We had a lot of people, in terms of visitors, coming in to the country to enjoy and view Cecil, so really this was a great loss," [...] Fundira said, and that Cecil's presence was [...] "a draw card," [...] and compared his death to [...] "the demise of an icon". The director of the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority, Karikoga Kaseke, said that tourism had been booming, but that Zimbabwe was now perceived as a country which was not interested in protecting and promoting animal rights, and this had also had a negative effect on the tourism sector.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, CSI {{executive}} producer Anthony Zuiker began casting for the then-unnamed Miami based spin-off. First cast was Emily Procter, as Calleigh Duquesne. Regarding {{her decision to}} leave The West Wing and join Miami, Procter stated that [...] "It was like choosing between a boyfriend that {{wants to be with}} you casually or a man that says I love you." [...] She described her character as [...] "a weird girl [...] bright and very nerdy. She wears a lot of boot-cut corduroy pants and turquoise necklaces and looks like a hippie. I just like to pretend I'm Velma in Scooby-Doo." [...] Adam Rodriguez, Rory Cochrane, and Khandi Alexander were cast alongside Procter, completing the supporting ensemble. For the lead, CBS suggested David Caruso. Zuiker, who stated that he had [...] "heard about the NYPD Blue thing," [...] was initially hesitant. Elaborating, Zuiker stated that he [...] "sort of jumped in and said, 'Naw, I don't <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> guy. The show's tough enough to get off the ground and I don't want to walk into any problems." [...] CBS president Les Moonves had announced in January that a Miami spin-off was imminent, yet [...] "It wasn't until we sort of, like, at the eleventh hour, really started to look at our options as to who was going to play Horatio, [...] revisited Caruso. And [...] said, 'Yeah, we'll have him come out for dinner, see what he's about.'" [...] Caruso was later cast as Caine. He was the last pilot cast member to be contracted to series.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 November 1992, the Provisional Irish Republican Army {{attempted}} {{to place a}} large improvised explosive device near the tower. The IRA had already worked out that to cause maximum damage, the bomb had to be placed under the Docklands Light Railway bridge to disrupt infrastructure near the Canary Wharf Tower for a devastating effect. The bomb was in a van which was driven to the designated place. [...] As the bombers were about to make their escape, security guards approached the van because it was parked illegally on double yellow lines. Two men {{got out of the}} vehicle and one pointed a revolver at one of the security guards. The gun failed to fire. The terrorists were then pursued as far as the boundary of the wharf, but they escaped. [...] Armed police were on the scene within minutes and the army bomb squad discovered that the vehicle contained a bomb. The detonator failed to ignite the main charge, and the bomb did not go off, so there was no bomb damage to Canary Wharf. The wharf was sealed off {{for a couple of days}} whilst an intensive search took place for further devices. [...] A few days later, the IRA described it as 'sheer ill luck' as the bomb failed to detonate. [...] There was criticism that the intelligence services did not <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> massive bomb travelling through London. [...] As a result of this attempted bombing, the observation floor was closed (see Public access section) and security was dramatically increased at Canary Wharf.|$|E

He wouldn't have done it, and Vince knew that. That's why he didn't tell Pat...". However, in Dave Meltzer's online account of events before, during, and after the Screwjob, he states [...] "Vince McMahon held a meeting at the hotel with Jim Ross, Jim Cornette, Pat Patterson and Michaels. Reports are that at least two of the aforementioned names looked extremely uncomfortable leaving the meeting" [...] which suggests that Patterson may in fact have been in on the Screwjob. This is corroborated by a Pro Wrestling Torch article from November 15, 1997 by Wade Keller which states, [...] "However, a two-hour meeting was held on the second floor of the Montreal Marriott on Saturday night with McMahon, Jim Ross, Pat Patterson, Jim Cornette, and Michaels. Bret was wrestling that night in Detroit. There is some belief that at this meeting McMahon proposed the idea of the finish to whoever of that group wasn't already in on it. Ross and Patterson entered the meeting in a good mood and when they were seen in the hotel lobby afterwards, were said to be irritable, forlorn, and shaken." ...|$|E
