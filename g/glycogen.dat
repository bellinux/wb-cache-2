5|$|A {{very well}} {{understood}} example of extrinsic control is {{the regulation of}} glucose metabolism by the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced in response to rises in blood glucose levels. Binding of the hormone to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and <b>glycogen.</b> The metabolism of <b>glycogen</b> is controlled by activity of phosphorylase, the enzyme that breaks down <b>glycogen,</b> and <b>glycogen</b> synthase, the enzyme that makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting <b>glycogen</b> synthase, but activating phosphorylase. Insulin causes <b>glycogen</b> synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing {{a decrease in the}} phosphorylation of these enzymes.|$|E
5|$|It is a big, strong cat, {{similar to}} the Maine Coon breed, with long legs, a bushy tail and a sturdy body. The breed {{is very good at}} climbing, since they have strong claws. The {{lifespan}} is usually 14 to 16 years, though kidney and heart diseases {{have been reported in the}} breed. Specifically in this breed, complex rearrangements of <b>glycogen</b> branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause a perinatal hypoglycaemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in <b>glycogen</b> storage disease type IV.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{cells are}} {{another example of}} {{specialized}} cells that contain an abundance of smooth ER. These cells provide {{an example of the}} role of smooth ER in carbohydrate metabolism. Liver cells store carbohydrates in the form of <b>glycogen.</b> The breakdown of <b>glycogen</b> eventually leads to the release of glucose from the liver cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. However, the primary product of <b>glycogen</b> breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate. This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the liver cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, so that it can then leave the cell.|$|E
5|$|Examples of post-translational {{modification}} include phosphorylation, myristoylation and glycosylation. For example, in {{the response to}} insulin, the phosphorylation of multiple enzymes, including <b>glycogen</b> synthase, helps control the synthesis or degradation of <b>glycogen</b> and allows the cell to respond to changes in blood sugar. Another example of {{post-translational modification}} is the cleavage of the polypeptide chain. Chymotrypsin, a digestive protease, is produced in inactive form as chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas and transported in this form to the stomach where it is activated. This stops the enzyme from digesting the pancreas or other tissues before it enters the gut. This type of inactive precursor to an enzyme {{is known as a}} zymogen or proenzyme.|$|E
5|$|The cycle {{describes}} how the human body uses chemical reactions to break some carbohydrates such as <b>glycogen</b> in muscle tissue into lactic acid, while synthesizing others.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{possess a}} pancreas, liver and gall bladder. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is {{determined}} by its function as a <b>glycogen</b> and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up. Adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates are {{aldehydes}} or ketones, {{with many}} hydroxyl groups attached, that can exist as straight chains or rings. Carbohydrates {{are the most}} abundant biological molecules, and fill numerous roles, such as the storage and transport of energy (starch, <b>glycogen)</b> and structural components (cellulose in plants, chitin in animals). The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides and include galactose, fructose, and most importantly glucose. Monosaccharides can be linked together to form polysaccharides in almost limitless ways.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates make up {{the bulk}} of the fruit bodies, {{comprising}} 9.23% of the fresh weight (see table), and 65.4% of the dry weight. The carbohydrate component contains the monosaccharides glucose, mannitol and α,α-trehalose, the polysaccharide <b>glycogen,</b> and the water-insoluble structural polysaccharide chitin, which accounts for up to 80–90% of dry matter in mushroom cell walls. Chitin, hemicellulose, and pectin-like carbohydrates—all indigestible by humans—contribute to the nutritionally desirable high proportion of insoluble fibre in B.edulis.|$|E
5|$|His {{prolific}} output, {{mainly in}} chemical pathology, included {{research into the}} metabolism of <b>glycogen,</b> uric acid, and urea; studies into an epidemic of cholera in Amsterdam; the toxicity of Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade); various pigmented substances in the blood (including porphyrins); {{the nature of the}} heart sounds; and several contributions in tropical medicine, in which he was considered an expert. He also described the blood disorder methaemoglobinaemia.|$|E
5|$|Kidney {{and heart}} {{diseases}} {{have been reported}} in the breed. In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's <b>Glycogen</b> branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in <b>glycogen</b> storage disease type IV in the breed. This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it. There are DNA tests available for GSD IV, and it is highly recommended (some cat associations obligate their Norwegian Forest cat breeder members) to carry out the DNA test before using such animals for breeding. PawPeds provide a pedigree database which comes together with health programmes, through publishing each single cat's test result, to provide useful information for breeders to make a well-informed breeding decision. The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia, which is a rare, partially hereditary disease of the hip joint.|$|E
5|$|With other eukaryotes: Fungal cells contain membrane-bound nuclei with {{chromosomes}} {{that contain}} DNA with noncoding regions called introns and coding regions called exons. Fungi have membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria, sterol-containing membranes, and ribosomes of the 80S type. They have a characteristic range of soluble carbohydrates and storage compounds, including sugar alcohols (e.g., mannitol), disaccharides, (e.g., trehalose), and polysaccharides (e.g., <b>glycogen,</b> {{which is also}} found in animals).|$|E
5|$|In most brachiopods, diverticula (hollow extensions) of {{the mantle}} {{penetrate}} through the mineralized {{layers of the}} valves into the periostraca. The function of these diverticula is uncertain and {{it is suggested that}} they may be storage chambers for chemicals such as <b>glycogen,</b> may secrete repellents to deter organisms that stick to the shell or may help in respiration. Experiments show that a brachiopod's oxygen consumption drops if petroleum jelly is smeared on the shell, clogging the diverticula.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{stages of the}} disease, the biopsy {{typically}} shows steatosis (deposition of fatty material), increased <b>glycogen</b> in the nucleus, and areas of necrosis (cell death). In more advanced disease, the changes observed are quite similar to those seen in autoimmune hepatitis, such as infiltration by inflammatory cells, piecemeal necrosis and fibrosis (scar tissue). In advanced disease, finally, cirrhosis is the main finding. In acute liver failure, degeneration of the liver cells and collapse of the liver tissue architecture is seen, typically on a background of cirrhotic changes. Histochemical methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable, and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{are able}} to dive {{for long periods of}} time. Both {{pinnipeds}} and cetaceans have large and complex blood vessel systems which serve to store oxygen to support deep diving. Other important reservoirs include muscles, blood, and the spleen which all have the capacity to hold a high concentration of oxygen. They are also capable of bradycardia (reduced heart rate), and vasoconstriction (shunting most of the oxygen to vital organs such as the brain and heart) to allow extended diving times and cope with oxygen deprivation. If oxygen is depleted, marine mammals can access substantial reservoirs of <b>glycogen</b> that support anaerobic glycolysis of the cells involved during conditions of systemic hypoxia associated with prolonged submersion.|$|E
5|$|Some {{bacteria}} produce intracellular nutrient storage granules {{for later}} use, such as <b>glycogen,</b> polyphosphate, sulfur or polyhydroxyalkanoates. Certain bacterial species, {{such as the}} photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, produce internal gas vacuoles, vesicles which they use to regulate their buoyancy—allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels. The gas vacuoles are freely permeable to gas. Intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria. Used primarily for photosynthesis, they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids. An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artefacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy. Inclusions {{are considered to be}} nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes. The most common inclusions are <b>glycogen,</b> lipid droplets, crystals, and pigments. Volutin granules are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic polyphosphate. These granules are called metachromatic granules due to their displaying the metachromatic effect; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes methylene blue or toluidine blue.Microcompartments are widespread, membrane-bound organelles that are made of a protein shell that surrounds and encloses various enzymes. Carboxysomes are bacterial microcompartments that contain enzymes involved in carbon fixation. Magnetosomes are bacterial microcompartments, present in magnetotactic bacteria, that contain magnetic crystals.|$|E
5|$|About 90% of beetle species enter {{a period}} of adult diapause, a quiet phase with reduced {{metabolism}} to tide unfavourable environmental conditions. Adult diapause {{is the most common}} form of diapause in Coleoptera. To endure the period without food (often lasting many months) adults prepare by accumulating reserves of lipids, <b>glycogen,</b> proteins and other substances needed for resistance to future hazardous changes of environmental conditions. This diapause is induced by signals heralding the arrival of the unfavourable season; usually the cue is photoperiodic. Short (decreasing) day length serves as a signal of approaching winter and induces winter diapause (hibernation). A study of hibernation in the Arctic beetle Pterostichus brevicorni showed that the body fat levels of adults were highest in autumn with the alimentary canal filled with food, but empty by the end of January. This loss of body fat was a gradual process, occurring in combination with dehydration.|$|E
5|$|The brain consumes up {{to twenty}} percent of the energy used by the human body, more than any other organ. Brain {{metabolism}} normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source, but during times of low glucose (such as fasting, endurance exercise, or limited carbohydrate intake), the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose. The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise. Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies. However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells. The brain stores glucose in the form of <b>glycogen,</b> albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop anchors {{itself to}} the {{substrate}} with a few byssus threads. It is unclear what {{the purpose of these}} is but they may serve to help orient the scallop with regard to the current for optimal feeding. Another possibility is that they may angle the scallop ready for a quick getaway. They are easily broken when the scallop starts to swim. It is a filter feeder. It exposes its mantle by separating its valves and passes water through its gills by ciliary action. A large scallop can process about 4 litres of water an hour per gram of its weight. Phytoplankton are sieved from the water by the gills and moved to the mouth in ciliated grooves. Here they are sorted by a pair of labial palps (mouth appendages), before being ingested. Rejected particles are formed into mucous-wrapped blobs. These are ejected from the mantle cavity at intervals along with the faeces by a rapid clapping of the valves. When the gonads are ripening, a raised level of microalgae in the diet has been found to increase gonadal development. At this time, <b>glycogen</b> storage in the main adductor muscle is depleted as energy is transferred from there to the gonads.|$|E
25|$|G6P, {{the product}} of glucokinase, is the {{principal}} substrate of <b>glycogen</b> synthesis, and glucokinase has a close functional and regulatory association with <b>glycogen</b> synthesis. When maximally active, GK and <b>glycogen</b> synthase appears to {{be located in the}} same peripheral areas of hepatocyte cytoplasm in which <b>glycogen</b> synthesis occurs. The supply of G6P affects the rate of <b>glycogen</b> synthesis not only as the primary substrate, but by direct stimulation of <b>glycogen</b> synthase and inhibition of <b>glycogen</b> phosphorylase.|$|E
25|$|After a meal {{has been}} digested and glucose levels begin to fall, insulin {{secretion}} is reduced, and <b>glycogen</b> synthesis stops. When {{it is needed}} for energy, <b>glycogen</b> is broken down and converted again to glucose. <b>Glycogen</b> phosphorylase is the primary enzyme of <b>glycogen</b> breakdown. For the next 8–12 hours, glucose derived from liver <b>glycogen</b> is {{the primary source of}} blood glucose used {{by the rest of the}} body for fuel.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glycogen</b> {{functions}} {{as one of}} two forms of long-term energy reserves, with the other form being triglyceride stores in adipose tissue (i.e., body fat). In humans, <b>glycogen</b> is made and stored primarily in {{the cells of the}} liver and skeletal muscle. In the liver, <b>glycogen</b> can make up from 5–6% of the organ's fresh weight and the liver of an adult weighing 70kg can store roughly 100–120grams of <b>glycogen.</b> In skeletal muscle, <b>Glycogen</b> is found in a low concentration (1–2% of the muscle mass) and the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70kg can store roughly 400grams of <b>glycogen.</b> The amount of <b>glycogen</b> stored in the body—particularly within the muscles and liver—mostly depends on physical training, basal metabolic rate, and eating habits. Small amounts of <b>glycogen</b> are also found in other tissues and cells, including the kidneys, red blood cells, white blood cells, and glial cells in the brain. The uterus also stores <b>glycogen</b> during pregnancy to nourish the embryo.|$|E
25|$|Induce <b>glycogen</b> {{synthesis}} – When glucose {{levels are}} high, insulin induces {{the formation of}} <b>glycogen</b> by the activation of the hexokinase enzyme, which adds a phosphate group in glucose, thus resulting in a molecule that cannot exit the cell. At the same time, insulin inhibits the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which removes the phosphate group. These two enzymes are key {{for the formation of}} <b>glycogen.</b> Also, insulin activates the enzymes phosphofructokinase and <b>glycogen</b> synthase which are responsible for <b>glycogen</b> synthesis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glycogen</b> in muscle, liver, and {{fat cells}} {{is stored in}} a {{hydrated}} form, composed {{of three or four}} parts of water per part of <b>glycogen</b> associated with 0.45millimoles of potassium per gram of <b>glycogen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Phosphoprotein {{phosphatase}} {{is activated}} by the hormone insulin, {{which indicates that}} there is a high concentration of glucose in the blood. The enzyme then acts to dephosphorylate other enzymes, such as phosphorylase kinase, <b>glycogen</b> phosphorylase, and <b>glycogen</b> synthase. This leads to phosphorylase kinase and <b>glycogen</b> phosphorylase's becoming inactive, while <b>glycogen</b> synthase is activated. As a result, <b>glycogen</b> synthesis is increased and glycogenolysis is decreased, and the net effect is for energy to enter and be stored inside the cell.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glycogen</b> {{synthesis}} is, unlike its breakdown, endergonic—it {{requires the}} input of energy. Energy for <b>glycogen</b> synthesis comes from uridine triphosphate (UTP), which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in a reaction catalysed by UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. <b>Glycogen</b> is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose initially by the protein glycogenin, which has two tyrosine anchors for the reducing end of <b>glycogen,</b> since glycogenin is a homodimer. After about eight glucose molecules {{have been added to}} a tyrosine residue, the enzyme <b>glycogen</b> synthase progressively lengthens the <b>glycogen</b> chain using UDP-glucose, adding α(1→4)-bonded glucose. The <b>glycogen</b> branching enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the <b>glycogen</b> molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.|$|E
25|$|The body {{builds up}} a store of <b>glycogen</b> from {{converted}} carbohydrates in muscle cells. <b>Glycogen,</b> a fuel used by muscles for energy, is depleted during work and restocked when a horse rests. Oxygen-carrying blood metabolizes <b>glycogen,</b> but the blood can not flow {{fast enough to}} metabolise the excess stored <b>glycogen.</b> The <b>glycogen</b> that is not metabolized aerobically (by the oxygenated blood) must then be metabolized anaerobically, which then creates the cell waste products and heat, and ER has begun. A horse on a high-grain diet with little work collects more <b>glycogen</b> in its muscles than it can use efficiently when exercise begins, which is why horses on a high-grain diet {{are more likely to}} develop ER.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to the way}} <b>glycogen</b> is synthesised, every <b>glycogen</b> granule has at {{its core}} a glycogenin protein.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} disease in which <b>glycogen</b> {{metabolism}} becomes abnormal is diabetes, in which, because of abnormal amounts of insulin, liver <b>glycogen</b> can be abnormally accumulated or depleted. Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes <b>glycogen</b> metabolism, as well.|$|E
25|$|The GBE1 gene {{provides}} {{instructions for}} making the <b>glycogen</b> branching enzyme. This enzyme {{is involved in the}} production of a complex sugar called <b>glycogen,</b> which is a major source of stored energy in the body. Most GBE1 gene mutations result in a shortage (deficiency) of the <b>glycogen</b> branching enzyme, which leads to the production of abnormal <b>glycogen</b> molecules. These abnormal <b>glycogen</b> molecules, called polyglucosan bodies, accumulate within cells and cause damage. Neurons appear to be particularly vulnerable to the accumulation of polyglucosan bodies in people with this disorder, leading to impaired neuronal function.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these two metabolic pathways, glucose 6-phosphate may also be converted to <b>glycogen</b> or starch for storage. This storage is in the liver and muscles {{in the form of}} <b>glycogen</b> for most multicellular animals, and in intracellular starch or <b>glycogen</b> granules for most other organisms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glycogen</b> Phosphorylase Isoenzyme BB-(GPBB) is {{an early}} marker of cardiac {{ischemia}} {{and is one of}} three isoenzyme of <b>Glycogen</b> Phosphorylase.|$|E
25|$|Various inborn {{errors of}} {{metabolism}} {{are caused by}} deficiencies of enzymes necessary for <b>glycogen</b> synthesis or breakdown. These are collectively referred to as <b>glycogen</b> storage diseases.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 4grams of glucose {{are present}} in the blood of humans at all times; in fasted individuals, blood glucose is {{maintained}} constant at this level at the expense of <b>glycogen</b> stores in the liver and skeletal muscle. <b>Glycogen</b> stores in skeletal muscle serve as a form of energy storage for the muscle itself; however, the breakdown of muscle <b>glycogen</b> impedes muscle glucose uptake, thereby increasing the amount of blood glucose available for use in other tissues. Liver <b>glycogen</b> stores serve as a store of glucose for use throughout the body, particularly the central nervous system. The human brain consumes approximately 60% of blood glucose in fasted, sedentary individuals.|$|E
25|$|Glucose is {{the major}} energy source in most life forms. For instance, polysaccharides are broken down into their {{monomers}} (<b>glycogen</b> phosphorylase removes glucose residues from <b>glycogen).</b> Disaccharides like lactose or sucrose are cleaved into their two component monosaccharides.|$|E
25|$|When athletes ingest both {{carbohydrate}} and caffeine following exhaustive exercise, their <b>glycogen</b> stores {{tend to be}} replenished more rapidly; {{however, the}} minimum dose of caffeine at {{which there is a}} clinically significant effect on <b>glycogen</b> repletion has not been established.|$|E
25|$|A person {{inherits}} loss-of-function {{mutations in}} the GBE1 gene from each parent, {{and the lack}} of <b>glycogen</b> branching enzyme (the protein encoded by GNE1) leads to buildup of unbranched <b>glycogen</b> in cells, which harms neurons more than other kinds of cells.|$|E
