40|$|Introduction// In Myanmar, people’s {{participation}} {{has been}} prioritized as an imperative of national forest policy in 1995 {{endorsed by the}} community forestry instructions (CFIs). Today, there are about 42, 148 ha of community forestry (CF) management by 572 user groups (USGs). In CF management, the people are engaging three types of activities: (1) to preserve or improve the production system such as planting trees and promoting the growth of trees, (2) to use forest resources for subsistence needs, (3) to get cash by selling the timber harvested or furniture made by the timber. Initial participation by {{the people and their}} continuation of CF activities are considered to be indispensable for sustainable forest management. In practice, however, the improvement of forest management and protection are often threatened because of difficulties in continuing the activities even though initial participation was achieved. Providing secure property rights is among the major factors that contribute to continuing CF activities. Thus the objectives of the dissertation are (1) to find out the factors affecting initial participation of USG members in management activities in Myanmar, (2) to assess the role of property rights in sustaining CF activities in the Philippines, and (3) to draw implications for Myanmar policy in terms of property rights issues from the case of the Philippines. //Analytical framework and data collection// Decentralized forest management is an alternative way for conventional centralized approach that encourages people participation in forest management. For achieving sustainable forest governance in this approach, participation of communities and the role of property rights are among the major factors. In order to investigate important factors for initial participation of local people, which is the first objective of the research, a framework that explores the nature of causal relationships among economic, social /institutional and physical factors was constructed by modifying existing framework. Data were collected from four USGs of agroforestry (AF) type and natural forest (NF) type of CFs in central dry zone of Myanmar. Semi-structured formal interviews were conducted at household level (15 households from each of sample USG in the AF type, 50 % of households from sample USG in the NF type) to know their social and economic situations. Other data were collected by applying key informant interviews, participant observation, informal interviews and reviews of the meeting records of USGs. In order to analyze the role of property rights in decentralization that shape sustainable forest governance, the second objective of the study, two concepts are applied as analytical framework: (1) “bundle of rights” consisting of the right of access, withdrawal, management, exclusion, and alienation, and (2) “three levels of rules” such as operational, collective-choice and constitutional rules. Different property rights will achieve different forest governance outcomes in terms of forest resources as well as income. The research is undertaken in 3 systems of community-based forest management (CBFM) located in northern Philippines: central government-initiated program (CGIP), local government-initiated program (LGIP) and traditional forest management (TFM) system. 111 households from 9 villages were randomly selected to collect data such as demographics data, property rights, income from selling crops and numbers of trees on their farms. Key informant and informal interviews with 41 respondents were also conducted. To facilitate decentralized policy for sustainable forest governance in Myanmar by improving property right issues through lessons from the Philippines, the third objective of the study, property right issues from three CBFM programs in the Philippines and two types of CF from Myanmar were compared by applying SWOT analysis. In SWOT analysis, the policies were regarded as external factors to generate ‘opportunities’ and ‘threats’: the communities such as POs in the Philippines and USGs in Myanmar might have some ‘strengths’ and ‘weaknesses’. Then the policy implication to support strategies to be taken by the USG in Myanmar were proposed by considering how {{to make use of the}} ‘opportunity’, how to defend against the ‘threats’, how to promote the ‘strengths’, and how to overcome the ‘weaknesses’. //Factors affecting participation of USG members in the Dry Zone, Myanmar// In AF type CF, performance of USG was measured by the number of trees managed by households in each individual plot. Under the favorable market situations, all respondents have income which encourage initial participation in CF. The study showed that the more the leaders work on the farm, the better their active participation in discharging their responsibilities for supervising, monitoring and decision making which affect rule awareness and cooperation among members in the execution phase. It was found that social/institutional factors can mediate the negative effect of economic factors. In NF type CF, performance of USG was measured in terms of the proportion of members participating in collective resource management. Under the situation where economic benefits are not yet received, those who had experience as village head could take better coordination and leadership. The achievement of collective action was higher when majority of members participated in decision-making process and vise versa. Additionally, the legal rights of CF motivated the people who have experience in traditional forest management as common property to participate in collective activities. When the institution lacked strong rule enforcement due to the weakness of social/institutional factors, it seemed that physical factor was more important for poor participation. //Property rights issues of CBFM in the Philippines// In both CGIP and LGIP, the people are granted all the five bundles of rights on the individual plots within the CBFM area, or full ownership. They are free to decide species of forest trees, fruit trees or crops as long as making sound ecological practices. Income from AF crops supported livelihoods of the households. In the TFM, the people can decide how to manage their resource and maximize the profit, although individual right holders are prohibited to sell or transfer their private property. Comparing withdrawal right on trees among three systems, the local people in TFM system are granted the most liberal and assured rights because they can devise operational rules in terms of quantity of resource use, timing of harvesting and harvesting technology, whereas such rules are regulated by higher level actors in CGIP and LGIP. The local people in CGIP gained operational and collective choice rights on the communal forest. Such devolution from the central government to local organization resulted in good forest management, although there are variations in three associations. On the other hand, LGIP i. e. devolution to local government unit, grant to communities limited operational level-rights and the management of whole watershed area is driven by local government, which weaken the function of the local organization in the long run. In the case of TFM, everybody can access and harvest the trees. //Comparison of the cases of Myanmar with the Philippines// In the Philippines, there were some opportunities: (1) Access, withdrawal, and management rights including marketing of forest products, and exclusion rights has been transferred to PO members; (2) PO members are permitted to rehabilitate the land by planting agricultural crops, fruit trees, trees or by making fish-breeding pond to enhance participation and support food security, and (3) PO members are given access to local financial, technical and seedlings support from other departments. The right to make operational rules, however, was controlled by national authority, which was obvious ‘threats’. The PO in the Philippines has the ‘strengths’ such as existence of internal regulation to define the powers and authority of the PO leaders and women’s involvement in collective-decision making and ‘weakness’ such as limited collective activities through participation of PO members. In Myanmar, the ‘opportunities’ were: (1) USGs were allowed to have the rights of access, withdrawal, management and exclusion, (2) Withdrawal rights to harvest naturally grown trees are not regulated, (3) They are not required to distribute any of CF benefits to the Forest Department (FD), and (4) The department provides seedlings of tree to USG. ‘Threats’ were: (1) CFIs did not prescribe the right of commercial harvest of forest products and the procedure involved when extracting forest products, (2) Exclusion rights were not ensured because there was no strong legal mechanism to punish the encroachers, even they are given the right to exclude outsiders, and (3) Legal status of the USG after termination of the project was fragile, (4) The management rights for the improvement of the land only emphasized on forest trees and, (5) Access to finance was limited for the USG members. The FUGs have ‘strengths’ such as existence of collective action under strong leadership, and ‘weaknesses’ such as lack of internal regulation to define the authority of the USG leaders and women’s involvement in collective decision making process. //Conclusion and policy implications// Decentralization in Myanmar is likely to be another form of centralization provided with few new benefits and little autonomy, while the approach of CBFM in the Philippines can be considered decentralization without devolution of authority, except TFM system. In order to overcome the threat of prohibition of commercial <b>harvest</b> <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>trees,</b> the scope of CFIs should allow commercial harvest to supply wood-based industries. FD shall issue additional orders for commercial <b>harvest</b> <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> including authorized procedures for obtaining cutting permits. To ensure exclusion rights and secure legal status of USGs, article 15 of forest law, which permit establishing village owned firewood plantation, should be strengthened. Moreover, CFIs should add a section on forest protection and conservation that provides secured and strong institutional power to exercise exclusion right. To improve the management right of USGs, section 19 (e) of CFIs, which concern with property right on how to manage and rehabilitate the land, should provide USGs to decide on how to rehabilitate the land including what type of tree and crops to plant. Lack of financial incentive for USG members can be overcome by providing other incentive including non-forest based alternative livelihood system through institutional linkage with other departments concerned. The existing strength of USGs like collective action under strong leadership can be applied in national programs like the national greening policy e. g. Bago Yoma greening program. In order to overcome the weakness, USGs should modify internal regulations to define authority of leaders and to allow women’s involvement; the FD should create sections of CFI to promote and legalize such internal regulations. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2013 - 03 - 25; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士（農学）; 学位記番号: 博農第 3938 号; 研究科・専攻: 農学生命科学研究科農学国際専...|$|E
40|$|Corruption {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious {{obstacles}} for ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation. In particular, more than half of the loss <b>of</b> <b>forested</b> area in many tropical countries is due to illegal logging, with corruption implicated in a lack of enforcement. Here we study an evolutionary game model to analyze the illegal <b>harvesting</b> <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>trees,</b> coupled with the corruption of rule enforcers. We consider several types of harvesters, who may or may not be committed towards supporting an enforcer service, and who may cooperate (log legally) or defect (log illegally). We also consider two types of rule enforcers, honest and corrupt: while honest enforcers fulfill their function, corrupt enforcers accept bribes from defecting harvesters and refrain from fining them. We report three key findings. First, in the absence of strategy exploration, the harvester-enforcer dynamics are bistable: one continuum of equilibria consists of defecting harvesters and a low fraction of honest enforcers, while another consists of cooperating harvesters and a high fraction of honest enforcers. Both continua attract nearby strategy mixtures. Second, even a small rate of strategy exploration removes this bistability, rendering one of the outcomes globally stable. It is the relative rate of exploration among enforcers that then determines whether most harvesters cooperate or defect and most enforcers are honest or corrupt, respectively. This suggests that the education of enforcers, causing their more frequent trialing of honest conduct, can be a potent means of curbing corruption. Third, if information on corrupt enforcers is available, and players react opportunistically to it, the domain of attraction of cooperative outcomes widens considerably. We conclude by discussing policy implications of our results...|$|R
40|$|Intensive {{forest biomass}} harvesting, or the removal <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> slash (woody debris from tree {{branches}} and tops) {{for use as}} biofuel, {{has the potential to}} negatively affect the soil microbial community (SMC) due to loss of carbon and nutrient inputs from the slash, alteration of the soil microclimate, and increased nutrient leaching. These effects could result in lowered forest productivity and threaten the long-term sustainability <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> management. Retaining organic material post-harvest, including greater amounts <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> slash and live trees, within harvested areas may ameliorate some negative effects <b>of</b> biomass <b>harvesting</b> on soil processes. We evaluated the effects <b>of</b> biomass <b>harvests</b> with reserve tree and slash retention on the SMC and soil nutrient bioavailability (assessed using plant-root simulator probes) in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) forests in northern Minnesota during the spring and summer, 1 – 3 years after harvest. Variable biomass removal levels tested include complete removal (whole tree <b>harvest</b> <b>of</b> boles and branches), complete slash retention (bole only harvest), and 20 % slash retention (amount suggested by regional biomass harvesting guidelines). Compared to the unharvested control, biomass harvests had no effect on the multivariate SMC composition or microbial biomass, but did result in a 1 – 4 % increase in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal abundance and reduced bacterial stress two and three years after harvest. Additionally, biomass harvesting increased NH 4 bioavailability during year one, and reduced NO 3 bioavailability during year two when compared to unharvested controls. Among the three biomass harvests with differing levels of slash removal there were few differences in overall SMC composition, microbial biomass, and soil nutrients; however, the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, gram positive and actinomycete bacteria were significantly higher in harvested treatments with more slash retained. These results are specific to single rotation biomass harvesting in aspen stands due to the unique relationships between plants and their associated SMCs, and may not be directly applicable to <b>forest</b> biomass <b>harvesting</b> <b>of</b> other commercial <b>forest</b> <b>tree</b> species, or multiple rotations...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: Forest {{cultures}} in continental part of Croatia are mainly based on bracken-covered areas and moors on deserted agriculture soils and pastures. Successful afforestation i. e. establishment <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> cultures depends {{among other things}} on the understanding of habitats and ecology <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>trees.</b> The choice <b>of</b> best species <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> for afforestation needs {{to be based on}} the research in soil and climate characteristics of target habitats. The aims of this research were to show mesoclimatic characteristics of Ličko sredogorje and microclimatic and pedological characteristics of Ličko polje. Also, based on habitat characteristics and ecology <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>trees,</b> the aim was to determine species <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> suitable for afforestation of bracken-covered areas. Materials and Methods: Climate, microclimate, pedological and plant nutrition researches were done at the area of Lika highlands. Climate analysis was done according to air temperatures, amount of precipitation, relative air humidity and other climate elements and appearances. Composite soil samples were taken from the depth of 0 - 30 cm in order to determine plant nutrition potential. Samples were prepared for further analysis in the laboratory. Results: The highest average annual air temperature of 9. 6 °C was found at weather station Gračac and the lowest at Korenica station (8. 1 °C). Average amount of precipitation for this region was around 1500 mm. Monthly rain factors were ranging from arid to perhumid. Considering thermal character of the climate, the area has moderately warm climate. Average volumetric soil humidity is 14. 2 %. Soil has strong acid reaction, is very humus, good to richly supplied with total nitrogen, content of physiologically active phosphorus and potassium is low, and C/N ration normal.
