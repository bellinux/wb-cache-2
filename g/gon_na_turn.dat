Despite its popularity, there is little research and literature on this twelve-step recovery program. In this thesis I argue that NA is aligned with neoliberal political rationalities, which are involved in promoting specific forms of individual responsibility and self-government in the construction of 'addict' subjectivities.

These arguments are elaborated upon through a discourse analysis of the Narcotics Anonymous Basic Text and a governmentality theoretical framework. Specifically, I use Foucault's modes of objectification to explore four ways by which people in <b>NA</b> are <b>turned</b> into subjects (scientific objectification, dividing practices, unifying practices and self-objectification).

It attempts to present a straightforward answer to the following questions: (i) how is structural (nominative and accusative) Case assigned in NA, given the recent developments and challenges in Chomsky’s (2001, 2005) Agree theory?, and (ii) how are Case and agreement features valued in NA syntax? A closer examination of structural Case in NA demonstrates that, unlike Standard Arabic, NA has an abstract Case system which is not morphologically realized, a similar phenomenon to that of English. Furthermore, the study examines structural Case assignment in VSO and SVO structures and points out that structural Case in NA is assigned via an Agree relation between a probe and a goal within a c-command domain. That is, in VSO structures in NA, nominative Case is assigned by the C-T complex via an Agree relation established between T and the subject in [Spec-TP] while accusative Case is a reflex of an Agree relation between the light v and the object DP.

40|$|ABSTRACT Batrachotoxin (BTX) -modified Na ÷ {{currents}} {{were characterized}} in GHn cells with a reversed Na + gradient under whole-cell voltage clamp conditions. BTX shifts {{the threshold of}} Na + channel activation by ~ 40 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction and nearly eliminates the declining phase of Na * currents at all voltages, suggesting that Na + channel inactivation is removed. Paradoxically, the steady-state inactivation (h®) of BTX-modified Na + channels as determined by a two-pulse protocol shows that inactivation is still present and occurs maximally near- 70 inV. About 45 % of BTX-modified Na ÷ channels are inactivated at this voltage. The development of inactivation follows a sum of two exponential functions with ~d<f*t,) = 10 ms and ~d~sJo~) = 125 ms at [...] 70 mV. Recovery from inactivation can be achieved after hyperpolarizing the membrane to voltages more negative than- 120 mV. The time course of recovery is best described by a sum of two exponentials with "rr~f~,,) = 6. 0 ms and ~'r~sio~) = 240 ms at- 170 mV. After reaching a minimum at- 70 mV, the h ~ curve of BTX-modified <b>Na</b> + channels <b>turns</b> upward to reach a constant plateau value of ~ 0. 9 at voltages above 0 mV. Evidently, the inactivated, BTXmodified Na + channels can be forced open at more positive potentials. The reopening kinetics of the inactivated channels follows a single exponential with a time constant of 160 ms at + 50 InV. Both chloramine-T (at 0. 5 mM) and or-scorpion toxin (at 200 nM) diminish the inactivation of BTX-modified Na ÷ channels. In contrast, benzocaine at 1 mM drastically enhances the inactivation of BTX-modified Na + channels. The h ® curve reaches a minimum of < 0. 1 at- 70 mV, indicating that benzocaine binds preferentially with inactivated, BTX-modified Na + channels. Together, these results imply that BTX-modified Na + channels are governed by an inactivation process...|$|R

Cheese {{is one of the most}} targeted products because of its high sodium content. In order to understand how to reduce salt in cheeses without modifying salty perception, the interactions between cheese structure and in-mouth sodium release have to be studied. In this way, model cheeses have been selected due to their great variability of formulation. The current study was conducted to determine how the release of sodium ions and aroma compounds could be modified by structure and composition of model cheeses (lipid/protein ratio, sodium content [...] .). The experimental approaches were performed by in vitro and in vivo investigations. Sodium mobility in model cheeses was analysed by 23 Na Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Diffusion and partition coefficients of sodium ions between cheese and water were obtained from in vitro measurements. Microstructural properties of model cheeses were analysed with Confocal Laser Scanning (CLS) microscopy and textural properties were characterized by rheological measurements. Then, aroma release was investigated by Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry (APCI-MS) during cheese consumption. Significant differences between model cheeses were found concerning sodium and aroma release. 23 <b>Na</b> NMR spectroscopy <b>turned</b> out to be an accurate method to quantify the total amount of sodium. Moreover this spectroscopy gave information on Na+ ions distribution, mobility and environment. Indeed, the presence of a fraction of 'bound' sodium ions was evidenced in all the cheeses. The hard model cheese with low lipid/protein ratio showed a higher fraction of 'bound' Na+ and a more specifically ordered environment around the ions. These aspects could be linked to lower diffusion and partition coefficients found in the hard model cheese, highlighting a lower sodium release.. In addition, aroma release was studied by APCI-MS. The in vivo experiments showed that aroma compounds were more released from the hard flavoured model cheese (low fat content) than the soft one. The results were relevant either with in vitro conditions or with in vivo consumption of model cheeses. In view of these results, it is obvious that composition, structure and micro-organisation mostly determine sodium and aroma release in model cheeses...|$|R
5000|$|In fall 783, after {{not being}} given rewards after being summoned to Chang'an in {{anticipation}} of further service to the east, the army of Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu) rebelled at Chang'an, forcing Emperor Dezong to flee to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). The Jingyuan army supported Zhu Tao's brother Zhu Ci, then at Chang'an, as emperor of a new state of Qin, and Qin forces subsequently put Emperor Dezong under siege at Fengtian. When this news reached the armies fighting the rebels in the east, the collective Tang forces in the east scattered, with Ma and Li Qiu returning to their circuits, Li Baozhen taking defensive position at Linming, and Li Huaiguang heading toward Chang'an, hoping to save Emperor Dezong. Subsequently, when Tian tried to persuade Wang and Zhu Tao's subordinate Ma Shi (馬寔) to attack Li Baozhen's position at Linming with him, Li Baozhen had Jia secretly persuade Wang that such a battle would not be to Wang's benefit—as if Linming fell, it would become part of Weibo territory, while a defeat would damage Hengji's army. Wang thus declined Tian's invitation and returned to Hengji. Subsequently, at Jia's further persuasion—pointing out that Zhu Tao's title of Prince of Ji showed an implicit ambition to take Wang's Ji Prefecture (冀州, in modern Hengshui, Hebei) and that Zhu Tao was planning to involve Huige forces and attack south to join with Zhu Ci—Wang made a secret pact with Li Baozhen and Ma Sui to turn against Zhu Tao. Wang was further able to persuade Tian and LI <b>Na</b> to <b>turn</b> against Zhu Tao as well. In 784, when Wang, Tian, and Li Na publicly renounced their princely titles, Emperor Dezong, then still at Fengtian although no longer under siege by Zhu Ci, accepted Wang's, Tian's, and LI Na's pledge of allegiance and officially made them military governors again, while honoring Li Baozhen with an honorary chancellor title. Tian Yue was subsequently assassinated and succeeded by his cousin Tian Xu, who continued to be aligned with imperial forces. When Zhu Tao and Huige forces subsequently attacked Tian Xu, Li Baozhen and Wang arrived to aid him. It was said, however, that despite the pact, Li Baozhen's army and Wang's army still viewed each other as enemies due to their long-time rivalry, and the armies suspected each other. Li Baozhen, {{in order to show}} Wang his good faith, took only a few soldiers with him and went into Wang's camp to meet him, further showing his good faith by sleeping there. Wang, touched by Li Baozhen's display, stated, [...] "My body has been promised to Brother Ten and will die for you." [...] Together, they defeated Zhu Tao, forcing him to flee back to Lulong and end his campaign to take over the region. (Zhu Tao subsequently renounced his princely title as well and died shortly thereafter.) For Li Baozhen's contributions, Emperor Dezong created him the Duke of Ni, and then the Prince of Yiyang. After the end of the wars, early in Emperor Dezong's Zhenyuan era (785 - 805), Li Baozhen visited Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Dezong but returned to Zhaoyi thereafter. In 787, when Emperor Dezong tried to put him in charge of an operation to regain the western prefectures lost to Tufan, Li Baozhen declined.

Anoxic effects were studied on normal nerve in vitro, which showed that nerve conductionblock follows, not as a consequence of inhibition of Na/K ATPase, but is caused byanother ATP-dependent mechanism. This energy dependent mechanism may either be neededfor the maintenance of the resting potential or it may be directly related to thefunction of the Na-channels. The likely effect in both cases, is a reversible inactivationof Na-channels. An increased resistance to ischaemia was demonstrated in diabetic nerve in vitro(nerve conduction studies), and in diabetic patients (studied with nerve conductionand vibratory thresholds). A delayed effect of anoxia was similarly discovered innormal nerve after blocking of Na/K-ATP-ase activity with ouabain. As there is evidenceof a decreased Na/KATP-ase activity in diabetic rat nerve, the common mechanism maybe a decreased ATP-consumption. A delayed recovery after anoxia was demonstrated in diabetic rat nerves in vitro. A delayed recovery was also found after ischaemia in diabetic patients studying mediannerve conduction and vibratory thresholds in the same innervation territory. Afterthe ischaemic test the nerve action potential in the diabetic group recovered tothe 50 % level after 5. 13 +- 0. 45 min, whereas it took less than one min in the controls. The half time for recovery of vibration threshold was 8. 8 +- 1. 0 min in the patientswith diabetes mellitus and 2. 6 +- 0. 3 min in controls. A model is proposed where a decreased Na/K-ATPase activity in diabetic nerve, likein ouabain-treated normal nerve, results in an intra-axonal <b>Na</b> accumulation, whichin <b>turn,</b> through the axolemmal Na/Ca exchange, may cause an increase in intracellularthe Ca-concentration and an impaired post-ischaemic recovery. The impaired recoveryafter ischaemic injuries may contribute to the higher incidence of entrapment neuropathiesin diabetes mellitus. Osteopenia can be a complication in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Overweight,common among patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), couldbe a confounding factor, counteracting the development of osteopenia. We found evidenceof osteopenia and neuropathy in the non-obese GK rat model of NIDDM. The GK rat couldthus be a suitable model for studies of reduced bone density and a possible causalrelationship between neuropathy and osteopenia in NIDDM.

40|$|Faithfully {{shuttling}} {{scores of}} different solutes between various bodily compartments, epithelia are strategically {{equipped with a}} plethora of diverse ion channels, cotransporters, exchangers and active pumps. Despite their functional eccentricities, however, these transport molecules don't toil away as renegade individualists. Rather, by continuously talking to their transporting companions through multiple and overlapping signaling pathways [1, 2], they consort to preserve intracellular homeostasis {{in the face of}} physiologic alterations in transcellular solute transport. The renal proximal tubule is no exception to the cross-talk phenomena. While recapturing the bulk of the glomerular ultra-filtrate, the proximal tubule amazingly reabsorbs about ten times its own weight in intracellular Na about once every minute [3, 4]. The cellular volume and intracellular potassium content are turned over at similar pace. Obviously, under the pressure of these herculean transcellular transport rates, intracellular homeostasis is constantly threatened. Even small physiological alterations in the filtered solute load and subsequent changes in transport through the cell would have dramatic and deleterious consequences on the intracellular milieu if it wasn't for the cross-talk signaling pathways that balance the activities of transporters carrying solutes into the cell with those that affect solute exit. For instance, consider the homeostatic conversation between the Na,K-ATPase and the potassium conductive pathway on the basolateral membrane [2, 5 – 13] observed during a substrate-evoked boost in transcellular Na reabsorption (Fig. 1). In the proximal tubule and other leaky epithelial, like the small intestine [3, 4, 14 – 16], the vectorial transport of Na from lumen to blood is governed by the in-series operation of a number of different, Na-coupled solute carriers at the apical membrane and an active Na-translocation step, the Na,K-ATPase, on the basolateral membrane. By design, the passage of Na into the cell is dependent on the availability of its cotransported partners [4, 14 – 18]. Subsequently, when substrates like glucose or amino acids are added to the lumenal compartment, apical <b>Na</b> entry is <b>turned</b> on [14, 17, 19]. Transcellular sodium reabsorption then accelerates as the active efflux step across the basolateral membrane, the Na,K-ATPase, increases to match passive Na entry by mechanisms involving a Nai-dependent alteration in the turnover rate [16] and possibility an increase in functional pump number or change in kinetic properties [20]. Remembering, that the Na,K-ATPase actively translocates three sodium ions in exchange for two potassium ions per cycle [21], first principals predict that the increase in pump rate would occur at the expense of a harmful elevation of intracellular K and cell volume. Neither happens. Instead, the basolateral K conductive pathway, comprised of K-selective channels [reviewed in 22, 23], is summoned to augment its activity in parallel with the increase in Na,K-ATPase turnover. The synchronized cross-talk response insures that the obligate active influx of potassium through the Na,K-ATPase will be efficiently recycled back across the basolateral membrane. In this way, intracellular K activity [7, 12], cell volume [5] and membrane potential [11, 24] are preserved during physiological surges in electrogenic Na transport. An analogous response reduces the extent passive K efflux and prevents deleterious K dumping when the activity of the Na,K-ATPase is reduced [15, 25, 26]. Although the tight and parallel coupling between the activity of the Na,K-ATPase and the magnitude of the K conductance at the basolateral membrane is a fundamental and essential property of nearly all salt translocating epithelial [2], the underlying transduction mechanism had proved to be rather elusive. Only in the last few years, with the application of the patch-clamp technique and the ability to mointor intracellular levels of potential coupling modulators, have the pieces of the pump-leak coupling puzzle begun to fit together. The role variety of putative signaling modulators, such as membrane stretch [6, 27 – 29], changes in Ca [10, 30] and pHi [11, 31 32] have now been clarified. Several laboratories have conclusively implicated the role of ATP-sensitive K channels and changes in intracellular ATP levels [13, 25, 26]. The present review focuses on these recent developments and the role of KATP in the cellular physiology of the renal proximal tubule...|$|R
