25|$|Kabbalah's <b>definition</b> <b>varies</b> {{according}} to the tradition and aims of those following it, from its religious origin {{as an integral part}} of Judaism, to its later Christian, New Age, and Occultist/western esoteric syncretic adaptations. Kabbalah is a set of esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between an unchanging, eternal, and mysterious Ein Sof (infinity) and the mortal and finite universe (God's creation). While it is heavily used by some denominations, it is not a religious denomination in itself. It forms the foundations of mystical religious interpretation. Kabbalah seeks to define the nature of the universe and the human being, the nature and purpose of existence, and various other ontological questions. It also presents methods to aid understanding of the concepts and thereby attain spiritual realization.|$|E

2500|$|Kabbalah (literally [...] "receiving"), is an esoteric method, {{discipline}} and {{school of thought}} of Judaism. Its <b>definition</b> <b>varies</b> according to the tradition and aims of those following it, from its religious origin {{as an integral part}} of Judaism, to its later Christian, New Age, or Occultist syncretic adaptations. Kabbalah is a set of esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between an unchanging, eternal and mysterious Ein Sof (no end) and the mortal and finite universe (his creation). While it is heavily used by some denominations, it is not a religious denomination in itself. Inside Judaism, it forms the foundations of mystical religious interpretation. Outside Judaism, its scriptures are read outside the traditional canons of organised religion. Kabbalah seeks to define the nature of the universe and the human being, the nature and purpose of existence, and various other ontological questions. It also presents methods to aid understanding of these concepts and to thereby attain spiritual realisation.|$|E
2500|$|Life {{satisfaction}} (global {{judgments of}} one's life) {{and satisfaction with}} specific life domains (e.g. work satisfaction) are considered cognitive components of SWB. The term [...] "happiness" [...] is also commonly used in regards to SWB and has been defined variously as [...] "satisfaction of desires and goals" [...] (therefore related to life satisfaction), as a [...] "preponderance of positive over negative affect" [...] (therefore related to emotional components of SWB), as [...] "contentment", and as a [...] "consistent, optimistic mood state" [...] and may imply an affective evaluation of one's life as a whole. [...] Life satisfaction can also {{be known as the}} [...] "stable" [...] component in one's life. [...] Affective concepts of SWB can be considered in terms of momentary emotional states as well as in terms of longer-term moods and tendencies (i.e. how much positive and/or negative affect a person generally experiences over any given period of time). Life satisfaction and in some research happiness are typically considered over long durations, up to one's lifetime. [...] "Quality of life" [...] has also been studied as a conceptualization of SWB. Although its exact <b>definition</b> <b>varies,</b> it is usually measured as an aggregation of well-being across several life domains and may include both subjective and objective components.|$|E
