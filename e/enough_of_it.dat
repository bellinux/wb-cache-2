25|$|By summer 1076, through piracy and raids Gisulf II of Salerno incited the Normans {{to destroy}} him; that season, under Richard of Capua and Robert Guiscard the Normans united to besiege Salerno. Although Gisulf ordered his {{citizens}} to store two years' worth of food, he confiscated <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> to starve his subjects. On 13 December 1076, the city submitted; the prince and his retainers {{retreated to the}} citadel, which fell in May 1077. Although Gisulf's lands and relics were confiscated, he remained at liberty. The Principality of Salerno had already been reduced {{to little more than}} the capital city and its environs by previous wars with William of the Principate, Roger of Sicily and Robert Guiscard. However, the city was the most important in southern Italy and its capture was essential {{to the creation of a}} kingdom fifty years later.|$|E
25|$|When {{the colony}} of New South Wales {{was founded in}} 1788, it ran into the problem {{of a lack of}} coinage. Foreign coins – {{including}} British, Dutch, Indian and Portuguese – were common in its early years, but much of this coin left the colony by way of trade with visiting merchant ships. Barter was a necessity amongst the colonists, with the most popular, rum becoming an unofficial currency. One of the first attempts to restrict the practice was by Governor King, who on 19 November 1800 set an arbitrary price for foreign coinage, but there was never <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> To try and resolve the shortage, he requested the supply of sixpences to be used as shillings, but failed to get a hearing. The practice of using rum as a currency was prohibited by Governor Bligh in 1806, eventually culminating in the overthrow of the government in the Rum Rebellion.|$|E

25|$|On 18 February 1943, the Scholls {{brought a}} {{suitcase}} full of leaflets {{to the university}} main building. They hurriedly dropped stacks of copies in the empty corridors for students to find {{when they left the}} lecture rooms. Leaving before the lectures had ended, the Scholls noticed that there were some left-over copies in the suitcase and decided to distribute them. Sophie flung the last remaining leaflets from the top floor down into the atrium. This spontaneous action was observed by the university maintenance man, Jakob Schmied. Hans and Sophie Scholl were taken into Gestapo custody. A draft of a seventh pamphlet, written by Christoph Probst, was found in the possession of Hans Scholl {{at the time of his}} arrest by the Gestapo. While Sophie Scholl got rid of incriminating evidence before being taken into custody, Hans did try to destroy the draft of the last leaflet by tearing it apart and trying to swallow it down. However, the Gestapo recovered <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and were able to match the handwriting with other writings from Probst, which they found when they searched Hans's apartment.|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} study that Dr. Kupferberg introduces to Dr. Melfi, which she later carefully reads and which makes her decide to finally drop Tony Soprano as her patient, is an actual three-volume study called The Criminal Personality, written by Dr. Samuel Yochelson and Dr. Stanton Samenow, published between 1977 and 1986. David Chase discovered the study {{when he and}} some Sopranos writers attended a psychiatric conference. Chase further asked forensic psychologist Nancy Duggan to analyze Tony Soprano's mental state and the progress of his psychotherapy with Melfi; Dugan also opined that talk therapy was enabling Melfi's patient to commit crime and justify his actions for himself. The Criminal Personality greatly impressed Chase after he read it and he decided that its introduction in the show would spell the end of Tony and Melfi's psychotherapy story arc in the series. After the airing of the episode, psychotherapists reported an outpouring of questions and concern from their clientele about the ethics of dropping patients unilaterally. Chase also commented about the seeming lack of finality in Tony Soprano's therapy, stating that its depiction was most realistic as psychotherapy most often is marked with moments of progress but is essentially an endless process until one party decides it has had <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|Thulium was so {{rare that}} none of the early workers had <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> to purify {{sufficiently}} to actually see the green color; they had to be content with spectroscopically observing the strengthening of the two characteristic absorption bands, as erbium was progressively removed. [...] The first researcher to obtain nearly pure thulium was Charles James, a British expatriate working on a large scale at New Hampshire College in Durham. In 1911 he reported his results, having used his discovered method of bromate fractional crystallization to do the purification. [...] He famously needed 15,000 purification operations to establish that the material was homogeneous.|$|E

Tom Doyle views [...] "the new wave-ish rockers" [...] like [...] "Spin It On" [...] as [...] "too smoothed out to be truly edgy" [...] and the two spoken-word tracks as [...] "weird – {{and not in a}} good way". Doyle considers that while Back to the Egg has its [...] "moments of inspiration", [...] "There was too much material , and yet not <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> to gel into a cohesive album." ...|$|E

[...] He had established decent relationships with George Washington, commander of the army, as well as Philip Schuyler and Horatio Gates, both of whom had command of the army's Northern Department during 1775 and 1776. [...] However, an acrimonious dispute with Moses Hazen, commander of the 2nd Canadian Regiment, boiled over into a court martial of Hazen at Ticonderoga during the summer of 1776. Only action by Gates, then his superior at Ticonderoga, prevented his own arrest on countercharges levelled by Hazen. [...] He had also had disagreements with John Brown and James Easton, two lower-level officers with political connections that resulted in ongoing suggestions of improprieties on his part.

500|$|Much of {{the army}} at Ticonderoga was ordered to march south in November, to {{reinforce}} Washington's army {{in the defense of}} New Jersey. [...] In Albany, Arnold was again made to face formal charges. [...] Brown and Hazen had each drawn up charges relating to earlier actions. [...] Hazen charged defamation of character over the accusations Arnold had earlier levelled against him, and Brown accused him of a variety of minor charges, but also two peculiar ones: first, that Arnold had deliberately spread smallpox throughout the army in Quebec, and second, that Arnold had, during the raid on Saint-Jean, made [...] "a treasonable attempt to make his escape ... to the enemy." [...] General Gates refused a hearing of Brown's charges, and a court martial, although it determined that Arnold's accusation against Hazen constituted [...] "an aspersion of Colonel Hazen's character", imposed no punishment.

500|$|On {{his way to}} {{the final}} of the Northern Ireland Trophy, which he lost 6–9 to Ding Junhui, he {{defeated}} semi–final opponent Dominic Dale 6–0, in only 53 minutes—a record for a best-of-11-frames match. O'Sullivan then reached the quarter-finals of the Grand Prix, but lost 1–5 against eventual champion Neil Robertson. In December 2006, in his quarter-final match of the UK Championship against Hendry, O'Sullivan conceded in dramatic fashion part-way into the sixth frame of the best-of-17 match. He had gone 0–4 down after a strong start from Hendry, before finally taking a frame back. At the beginning of the sixth frame, O'Sullivan opened with a break of 24, before leaving himself a difficult shot from black to red. After missing the red, he calmly shook the hand of both Hendry (saying to him that he had [...] "had <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> mate") and the match referee, Jan Verhaas, {{and walked out of the}} arena, stunning everyone present. The incident caused minor disruption to the other quarter-final match, between Graeme Dott and Steve Davis, being played simultaneously in the same arena. Dott later said that he initially thought that O'Sullivan and Hendry were having a fight when he heard an audience member shout [...] "Get a grip, Ronnie." [...] It was later officially confirmed that O'Sullivan had forfeited the match, which was awarded 9–1 to Hendry. O’Sullivan issued a statement later that day, apologising and saying that he would be [...] "back on his feet fighting stronger and harder than ever very soon." [...] On 31 May 2007, World Snooker fined him a total of £20,800 over this incident, and docked 900 ranking points from him.|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{was positive}} about the episode, writing [...] "This was the strongest overall Thursday this season for NBC's comedies, and 'Sun Tea' brought the evening to a fine close.

[...] He opined that if the episode gave more time to Kathy being represented by Teddy Ruxpin [...] "I would have given 'Sun Tea' my stamp of approval". In regards to the environment story, Sepinwall said it [...] "tied in nicely with both Frank's disgusting jars and the apartment plot". Nick Catucci [...] of New York magazine said that the episode was [...] "chockablock with great mini-sketches, gags, and flights of fancy."

Gandert enjoyed Jack/Tracy and Liz's plots, respectively, was glad that Chris Parnell returned as Dr. Spaceman, and said that Gore [...] "also rarely disappoints", but was not complimentary towards NBC [...] " [...] its green week thing" [...] into [...] "Sun Tea". Time contributor James Poniewozik observed that [...] "the best bits" [...] from this episode were [...] "Teddy Ruxpin the lawyer; the declaration that 'I, Bertram Geiss, am still Daddy's fancy boy'; and, especially, the show's treatment of the Green Is Universal mandate." ...|$|E
