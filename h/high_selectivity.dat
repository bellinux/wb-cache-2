In a single-pass heating cycle experiment, benzene, butadiene, and butane were catalyzed with different selectivities as function of cluster size: palladium and rhodium atoms selectively produce benzene, and the <b>highest</b> <b>selectivity</b> for butadiene is observed for Pd₆, whereas Pd₂₀ reveals the <b>highest</b> <b>selectivity</b> for butane. Ag atoms are inert. These results provide an atom-by-atom {{observation of the}} selectivity of small cluster catalysts...|$|R

25|$|Quazepam has potent sleep {{inducing}} {{and sleep}} maintaining properties. Studies in both {{animals and humans}} have demonstrated that EEG changes induced by quazepam resemble normal sleep patterns whereas other benzodiazepines disrupt normal sleep. Quazepam promotes slow wave sleep. This positive effect of quazepam on sleep architecture {{may be due to}} its <b>high</b> <b>selectivity</b> for type1 benzodiazepine receptors as demonstrated in animal and human studies. This makes quazepam unique in the benzodiazepine family of drugs.|$|E
25|$|Quazepam has an {{absorption}} half-life of 0.4 {{hours with}} a peak in plasma levels after 1.75 hours. It is eliminated both renally and through feces.

40|$|The {{selective}} hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde was studied over carbon nanofibers (CNF) supported platinum and ruthenium catalysts.

For the catalysts with oxygen on the CNF surface, the larger metal particles (3. 5 nm) displayed the <b>highest</b> <b>selectivity</b> towards cinnamyl alcohol.

30|$|However, the PDT {{efficacy}} is {{compromised by}} insufficient selectivity and low solubility.

25|$|Typically, the IF center {{frequency}} fIF is {{chosen to be}} less than the desired reception frequency fRF. The choice has some performance advantages. First, it is easier and less expensive to get <b>high</b> <b>selectivity</b> at a lower frequency. For the same bandwidth, a tuned circuit at a lower frequency needs a lower Q. Stated another way, for the same filter technology, a higher {{center frequency}} will take more IF filter stages to achieve the same selectivity bandwidth. Second, it is easier and less expensive to get high gain at a lower frequency. When used at high frequencies, many amplifiers show a constant gain–bandwidth product (dominant pole) characteristic. If an amplifier has a gain–bandwidth product of 100MHz, then it would have a voltage gain of 100 at 1MHz but only 10 at 10MHz. If the IF amplifier needed a voltage gain of 10,000, then it would need only two stages with an IF at 1MHz but four stages at 10MHz.|$|E
25|$|Adults {{are large}} flies, and unusual amongst brachyceran flies {{because they have}} a dense {{covering}} of fine setae (like hairs) and colored patterns that make them appear like bumble-bees (Hymenoptera). All species of the Oestridae are so highly adapted to the myiasis type of parasitism that the adults do not feed and have only residual mouthparts (see photograph of Hypoderma iparece). All these flies have an obligate myiasis life-cycle, with a complete metamorphosis. The females lay eggs with <b>high</b> <b>selectivity</b> on their special hosts and at specific sites there. For example, eggs laid on the legs of horses in the case of species of Gasterophilus. The horse licks at the irritated skin and the larvae transfer to the mouth of horse. The larvae penetrate tissues in the oral cavity, feed parasitically whilst migrating through tissue of the esophagus to finally reach the stomach. The final larval stage is completed with the larvae attached to the mucosa of the horse's stomach. When ready to pupate the larvae detach and are voided in the horse's feces. Another example is Dermatobia hominis, torsalo-fly, which is an important parasite of cattle, and sometimes humans, in tropical regions of South America. The larvae cause a localized, furuncular (= like a boil) myiasis in the skin of their hosts. The larvae infest these sites when transported there accidentally by blood feeding mosquitoes; the adult female Dermatobia flies lay their eggs on the legs of mosquitoes, a dispersal mechanism called phoresy.|$|E
500|$|Waveguides are a {{low-loss}} medium. [...] Losses in waveguides mostly {{come from}} ohmic dissipation caused by currents induced in the waveguide walls. [...] Rectangular waveguide has lower loss than circular waveguide {{and is usually}} the preferred format, but the TE01 circular mode is very low loss and has applications in long distance communications. [...] Losses can be reduced by polishing the internal surfaces of the waveguide walls.

500|$|The {{first volume}} {{production}} of mechanical filters was undertaken by Collins Radio Company {{starting in the}} 1950s. These were originally designed for telephone frequency-division multiplex applications where there is commercial advantage in using high quality filters. Precision and steepness of the transition band leads to a reduced width of guard band, which in turn leads {{to the ability to}} squeeze more telephone channels into the same cable. [...] This same feature is useful in radio transmitters for much the same reason. [...] Mechanical filters quickly also found popularity in VHF/UHF radio intermediate frequency (IF) stages of the high end radio sets (military, marine, amateur radio and the like) manufactured by Collins. [...] They were favoured in the radio application because they could achieve much higher Q-factors than the equivalent LC filter. [...] High Q allows filters to be designed which have <b>high</b> <b>selectivity,</b> important for distinguishing adjacent radio channels in receivers. [...] They also had an advantage in stability over both LC filters and monolithic crystal filters. The most popular design for radio applications was torsional resonators because radio IF typically lies in the 100 to 500kHz band.|$|E

2500|$|As first {{described}} by Hartwig, alkanes can be selectively borylated with <b>high</b> <b>selectivity</b> {{for the primary}} C–H bond using Cp*Rh(η4-C6Me6) as the catalyst.

The rhodium-catalyzed borylation of methyl C–H bonds occurs selectively without a dependence on the position of the heteroatom. Borylation occurs selectively at the least sterically hindered and least electron rich primary C–H bond in a range of acetals, ethers, amines, and alkyl fluorides. [...] Additionally, no reaction is shown to occur in the absence of primary C–H bonds, for example when cyclohexane is the substrate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fabrication}} of high-aspect-ratio structures requires {{the use of}} a photoresist able to form a mold with vertical sidewalls. Thus the photoresist must have a <b>high</b> <b>selectivity</b> and be relatively free from stress when applied in thick layers. [...] The typical choice, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is applied to the substrate by a glue-down process in which a precast, high-molecular-weight sheet of PMMA is attached to the plating base on the substrate. The applied photoresist is then milled down to the precise height by a fly cutter prior to pattern transfer by X-ray exposure. Because the layer must be relatively free from stress, this glue-down process is preferred over alternative methods such as casting. [...] Further, the cutting of the PMMA sheet by the fly cutter requires specific operating conditions and tools to avoid introducing any stress and crazing of the photoresist.|$|E
2500|$|Carbon dioxide adsorbs to a MOF through {{physisorption}} or chemisorption {{based on}} the porosity and selectivity of the MOF leaving behind a Greenhouse gas poor gas stream that is more environmentally friendly. The carbon dioxide is then stripped off the MOF using temperature swing adsorption (TSA) or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) so the MOF can be reused. Adsorbents and absorbents require regeneration steps where the [...] {{is removed from the}} sorbent or solution that collected it out of the flue gas in order for the sorbent or solution to be reused. Monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions, the leading amine for capturing , have a heat capacity between 3-4 J/g K since they are mostly water. Higher heat capacities add to the energy penalty in the solvent regeneration step. Thus, to optimize a MOF for carbon capture, low heat capacities and heats of adsorption are desired. Additionally, high working capacity and <b>high</b> <b>selectivity</b> are desirable in order to capture as much [...] as possible from the flue gas. However, there is an energy trade off with selectivity and energy expenditure. As the amount of [...] captured increases, the energy, and therefore cost, required to regenerate increases. A large drawback of using MOFs for CCS is the limitations imposed by their chemical and thermal stability. Current research is looking to optimize MOF properties for CCS, but it has proven difficult to find these optimizations that also result in a stable MOF. Metal reservoirs are also a limiting factor to the potential success of MOFs.|$|E
