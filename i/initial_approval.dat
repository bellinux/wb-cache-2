5|$|The Ypsilanti Heritage Festival Parade {{began in}} 1979, {{and has been}} held every year. In 2007, the parade {{attracted}} wider attention when parade organizers approved {{the inclusion of a}} group protesting a proposed city income tax and subsequently revoked the permission. Festival coordinators explained that their rule was to exclude groups marching to represent controversial or political issues, and that the <b>initial</b> <b>approval</b> was an error.|$|E
5|$|A {{decision}} by the US Army in the mid-2000s to replace all of its CH-47Ds with new-build CH-47Fs by 2017 endangered {{the viability of the}} Australian Chinooks. This was because the Australian Army's arrangements for the logistical support of its small fleet of CH-47Ds were heavily leveraged off those for the US Army's large fleet. In response, the Australian Army also established a project to acquire CH-47F Chinooks to replace its CH-47Ds in the mid-2000s. The Australian Government provided <b>initial</b> <b>approval</b> for a CH-47F purchase in September 2007. As part of this decision, the Government chose to procure the helicopters through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales program to minimise potential risks to the schedule and cost of the project.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of Valtorta argue that, {{according}} to canon law, the Roman Pontiff has full {{power over the}} whole Church, hence the <b>initial</b> <b>approval</b> given by Pope Pius XII effectively nullified any subsequent ruling by the Holy Office, including the Holy Office's action under his own reign and its later condemnation {{of the work and}} placing it on the Index, even with the approval of Pope John XXIII, in 1960.|$|E

5000|$|Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited is {{a public}} sector {{undertaking}} in India under the administrative control of the Department of Fertilizers, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers. The company began in 1961 when Indian government consolidated several state run fertiliser companies into a single SBU. FCI has manufacturing units in 5 states: Sindri complex (Jharkhand), Gorakhpur complex (Uttar Pradesh), Ramagundam complex (Telangana), Talcher complex (Odisha) and an un-commissioned project in Korba (Chhattisgarh). The organisation was declared [...] "sick" [...] in 1992 and in 2002 Government of India initiated actions to close the company.

25|$|The Force Intervention Brigade was {{originally}} authorized for a one-year period beginning in March 2013 under the MONUSCO mandate. However, since its <b>initial</b> <b>approval,</b> the Force Intervention Brigade has been reauthorized annually through Resolution 2211 (2015), which extended the MONUSCO mandate to 31 March 2016, and Resolution 2277 (2016), which extended the mandate to 31 March 2017.

25|$|Since the <b>initial</b> <b>approval</b> of {{the system}} from the public, local and {{national}} government, and environmental groups, Metrolink {{has become something of}} a victim of its own popularity. Many routes are extremely busy, especially at peak times, and prices have risen at far above the rate of inflation. The network has also gained a reputation for being somewhat unreliable. In 2011, Stagecoach Manchester who operated the Metrolink under contract to Transport for Greater Manchester, sold the contract to the RATP Group.|$|E
25|$|In November 2006, declaring {{satisfaction}} with the F-35's progress to date, the government gave 'first-pass' <b>initial</b> <b>approval</b> to the project under which F-35s will be acquired, deferring to late 2008 a {{decision on whether to}} actually order the aircraft. Following this <b>initial</b> <b>approval,</b> on 13 December 2006 Australia signed the JSF Production, Sustainment and Follow-on Development Memorandum of Understanding, which commits Australia to the next phase of the F-35's development. In October 2006 the deputy chief of the Air Force, Air Vice Marshal John Blackburn, publicly stated that the RAAF had considered suitable aircraft which could be acquired if the F-35 was delayed, but that such aircraft were not believed to be necessary {{on the basis of the}} F-35 program's progress at the time. Concerns over the F-35 delivery schedule developed in Australia during 2007. In February the defence minister announced that a risk mitigation strategy, which involved obtaining F/A-18F Hornets, was being developed to prevent a gap in the RAAF's air combat capability if the F-35 program was delayed. This strategy was adopted, and an order for 24 F/A-18Fs was announced on 6 March 2007. The first aircraft was delivered in 2009 and the first squadron was declared operational in December 2010.|$|E

25|$|Within days of its passage, United Aircraft and Transport Company (UATC) {{acquired}} the controlling interest of National Air Transport after a brisk but brief struggle between UATC and Clement M. Keys of NAT. The merger, begun in February 1930 {{to plug the}} only gap in UATC's cross-country network of airlines, had been amicable until three weeks before its finalization, when Keys reversed his <b>initial</b> <b>approval.</b> Ironically Brown was angered by the negotiations, worried that {{the specter of a}} potential monopoly would endanger the imminent passage of the Air Mail Act. The merger swiftly created the first transcontinental airline.|$|E
25|$|D'Alzon founded two {{congregation}}s, one for men (the Assumptionists) and one {{for women}} (the Oblates of the Assumption). The congregation of the Augustinians of the Assumption received its <b>initial</b> <b>approval</b> (‘decree of praise’) in 1857 and its definitive approval in 1864 (although its constitutions were not finally approved until 1923), and d'Alzon resigned from his post as vicar general in 1878 after 43 years of service. With his first disciples he undertook bold apostolic goals: the foreign missions (Australia, eastern Europe), education, the press, and pilgrimages. He died on November 21, 1880 in Nîmes and was declared Venerable by Pope John Paul II in December 1991.|$|E
25|$|As the {{population}} of St. Louis County grew, local subdivisions began multiplying and incorporating into tiny cities and towns, producing more than 90 separate municipalities by the 1960s. Those in favor of regional planning found some success, however, in the 1965 creation of the East-West Gateway Coordinating Council, a regional council given the power to advance applications for federal aid from cities in the region. Among the more controversial proposals {{to come from the}} East-West Council was the proposal to build a second regional airport, located somewhere on the Illinois side of the region. In spite of <b>initial</b> <b>approval</b> for the plan in the 1976, Secretary of the Interior Brock Adams canceled the airport project in 1977 under political pressure from Missourians, who feared a loss of business at Lambert International Airport.|$|E

50|$|In January 2006, the FDA {{unveiled}} {{a major change}} to the format of prescription drug information, {{commonly referred to as}} the Physician Labeling Rule (PLR). The new format requires that the content of labeling be organized in a specific manner.

It was intended that the upgrade project, under which almost 80 percent of the route would have been made operable at 200 km/h, would be finalised if possible by 1994.|$|R
25|$|The {{period between}} {{the death of a}} king, and the {{election}} of a new king, was known as the interregnum. During the interregnum, the senate elected a senator to the office of Interrex to facilitate the election of a new king. Once the Interrex found a suitable nominee for the kingship, he presented this nominee to the senate for an <b>initial</b> <b>approval.</b> If the senate voted in favor of the nominee, that person stood for formal election before the People of Rome in the Curiate Assembly (the popular assembly). After the nominee was elected by the popular assembly, the senate ratified the election by passing a decree. The Interrex then formally declared the nominee to be king. The new king then took the auspices (a ritual search for omens from the Gods), and was vested with legal authority (imperium) by the popular assembly.|$|E
25|$|Air Canada {{pursued a}} {{judicial}} review of TPA's plans to open the airport to other airlines. The action was heard in Federal Court in July 2010, and the Court dismissed Air Canada's claims against the TPA's decisions of December 2009 and April 2010 {{with respect to the}} airport slot allocations. Continental Airlines had also been reported as having interest in setting up Canada-U.S. flights from the airport. In June 2010, Air Canada and Continental Airlines received <b>initial</b> <b>approval</b> to fly {{into and out of the}} airport. Continental was allocated 16 slots, Air Canada 30 and Porter an additional 44 slots. In October 2010, Air Canada and the TPA concluded an operating agreement, and Air Canada was to begin operating flights starting in February 2011. Air Canada began flying out of the airport on May 1, 2011. However, United Continental Holdings, (the merged Continental Airlines and United Airlines) decided not to fly out of the airport. The 16 slots previously held by United Continental Holdings were awarded to Porter in September 2011.|$|E

2500|$|The {{artificial}} sweetener aspartame {{has been the}} subject of several controversies since its <b>initial</b> <b>approval</b> by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1974. The FDA approval of aspartame was highly contested, with critics alleging that the quality of the initial research supporting its safety was inadequate and flawed and that conflicts of interest marred the 1981 approval of aspartame. In 1987, the U.S. Government Accountability Office concluded that the food additive approval process had been followed properly for aspartame. The irregularities fueled a conspiracy theory, which the [...] "Nancy Markle" [...] email hoax circulated, along with claims, counter to the weight of medical evidence, that numerous health conditions (such as multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus, methanol toxicity, blindness, spasms, shooting pains, seizures, headaches, depression, anxiety, memory loss, birth defects, and death) are caused by the consumption of aspartame in normal doses.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the years}} of the monarchy, the Senate's most {{important}} function was to select new kings. The period between the death of one king and the election of the next, was called an interregnum. When a king died, a member of the Senate (the [...] "interrex"') would nominate a candidate to replace the king. After the Senate gave its <b>initial</b> <b>approval</b> of the nominee, he would then be formally elected by the people, and then receive the Senate's final approval. So while the king was officially elected by the people, it was effectively the Senate's decision. The Senate's most significant role outside of royal elections was as an advisory council to the king. While the king was not bound by the Senate's advice, the growing prestige of the Senate made its advice increasingly impolitic to ignore. Technically, the Senate could also make laws, though it would be incorrect to view the Senate's decrees as legislation in the modern sense. Only the king could decree new laws, although he would often involve both the Senate and the Curiate Assembly (the popular assembly) in the process.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{tentative}} Interstate numbering plans, the freeways in Michigan now numbered I-96 and I-196 {{were supposed to}} be part of the I-94 corridor, and the freeway between Muskegon and Grand Rapids was to be I-94N. Later, the <b>initial</b> <b>approvals</b> by the federal government routed I-96 from Benton Harbor north to Grand Rapids and then east to Detroit, and I-196 was the spur route from Grand Rapids to Muskegon. The first segment of freeway built was a relocated section of US16 near Coopersville and Marne. The freeway opened at the end of 1957 or in early 1958, and the first markers for I-196 were erected in 1959. The full Grand Rapids–Muskegon I-196 freeway was completed and opened to traffic in December 1962, connecting to an I-96 freeway that led east toward Lansing; the US16 corridor was a continuous freeway with two different Interstate designations. Before the Grand Rapids–Benton Harbor segment was completed, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD), predecessor to the modern MDOT, petitioned federal highway officials to switch the Interstate designations west of Grand Rapids. Permission for this switch was granted in 1963, and the signs were changed in January 1964. Consideration was also made to name the Grand Rapids–Benton Harbor freeway I-67. The previously completed I-196 was redesignated as an extension of I-96, and the completed freeway segments southwest of Grand Rapids were redesignated I-196; I-67 was rejected by the American Association of State Highway Officials.|$|R
