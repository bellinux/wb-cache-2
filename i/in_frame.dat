5|$|General praise went to {{the variety}} of choice in its {{narrative}} and gameplay, despite the former being seen as lacking in places and the latter being held back by other {{factors such as the}} limitations of the Biomod upgrade system and its limited environment sizes. Poor AI behavior was also a recurring criticism. The Xbox version was praised for its performance and graphics despite several reviewers noting distracting drops <b>in</b> <b>frame</b> rate and other technical issues. The PC version was frequently criticized as having similar frame rate issues in addition to problems with the controls, the necessity for a powerful computer to run the game properly, {{and the fact that the}} game was scaled down to run on the Xbox.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{script was}} laid out similar to a comic book, with {{pictures}} {{on the left and}} dialog and descriptions on the right. Jeunet planned every shot, which made it easier for visual effects artists to do their work. Blue Sky Studios was hired to create the first CGI Aliens to appear on film. Impressed with the company's work on Joe's Apartment creating CGI cockroaches, Jeunet and Pitof opted to hire the company to create 30 to 40 shots of CGI Aliens. The decision was made to use CGI Aliens rather than puppets or suited actors whenever the creatures' legs were <b>in</b> <b>frame,</b> as Jeunet felt that a man in a suit is easy to distinguish when the full body is seen.|$|E
5|$|The series' {{first three}} titles, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, and Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, {{received}} praise for their frantic gameplay style, visual flair, playable character rosters, {{and the quality}} of their sprite animations. The games' Dreamcast and Sega Saturn ports were also lauded for their technical performance, matching the capabilities of the arcade versions. Conversely, the PlayStation ports were criticized for their removal of tag team battles and noticeable decline <b>in</b> <b>frame</b> rate and animation quality – changes which stemmed from the console's RAM limitations.|$|E

Jaime is forced to cut every piece he installs down to fit. His mistake in the spray foam was using the can right-side up instead of upside-down.|$|R

5|$|The Buckeye is {{the only}} purely American breed to sport a pea comb, and this, {{combined}} with its stocky build, makes it a supremely cold hardy chicken. Other breeds of fowl developed in the U.S. (such as the Ameraucana) may sport pea combs, but these chickens were primarily created from foreign birds. It also bears some traits of Game fowl <b>in</b> <b>frame</b> and disposition, being assertive in character {{and a very good}} forager. Generally calm, the cock birds in rare cases may become aggressive. Despite its game heritage, it tolerates confinement well, although it will be much happier and produce better if allowed to range on grass. The Buckeye is said by breeders to be disinclined towards feather picking. A good meat producer and layer of between 150 and 200 eggs per year, the Buckeye is a dual purpose chicken wellsuited to small farmyard and backyard flocks.|$|E
5|$|While {{the video}} was filmed {{as a single}} shot on at least three {{different}} occasions, they planned on using post-editing to slow down or speed up {{certain parts of the}} take to keep it in time with the final soundtrack. There is a noted cut in the video, in which the camera passes through a set of curtains on the transition to the downstairs portion of the machine; according to one of the machine designers, Hector Alvarez, this cut was introduced by the band, speculating it was introduced to avoid a shot of one of the band members or cameraman <b>in</b> <b>frame</b> or otherwise to keep the machine video synchronized to the machine. Both Tim Nordwind, bassist for the band, and Adam Sadowsky, president of Syyn Labs, said that while the machine worked in its entirety 3 times, and no cut was needed, the decision was made so a better result on the downstairs portion could be included in the final version. There was also a second cut which can be noticed by watching a piano against a wall as the camera passed behind some rods; the piano can be seen apparently warping in shape and position.|$|E

25|$|Thus, we {{can solve}} {{problems}} <b>in</b> <b>frame</b> B by assuming that Newton's second law holds (with respect to quantities in that frame) and treating Ffictitious as an additional force.|$|E
25|$|The {{interpretation}} of this equation is that the velocity of the particle seen by observers <b>in</b> <b>frame</b> A consists of what observers <b>in</b> <b>frame</b> B call the velocity, namely vB, plus two extra terms related to {{the rate of change}} of the frame-B coordinate axes. One of these is simply the velocity of the moving origin vAB. The other is a contribution to velocity {{due to the fact that}} different locations in the non-inertial frame have different apparent velocities due to rotation of the frame; a point seen from a rotating frame has a rotational component of velocity that is greater the further the point is from the origin.|$|E

25|$|In her {{earliest}} depictions {{at temple}} entrances, the goddess Ganga appeared standing beneath the overhanging {{branch of a}} tree, as seen {{as well in the}} Udayagiri caves.

(The parasol can be clearly seen <b>in</b> <b>frame</b> 3 above; its stem can be seen <b>in</b> <b>frame</b> 4, but the rest has broken off.) The cover undergoes another transformation in the temple at Kharod, Bilaspur (ninth or tenth century), where the parasol is lotus-shaped, and yet another at the Trimurti temple at Badoli where the parasol has been replaced entirely by a lotus.|$|E

25|$|Fig. 2-9 {{illustrates}} {{the motions of}} a 1nbsp&m rod that is traveling at 0.5nbsp&c along the x axis. The edges of the blue band represent the world lines of the rod's two endpoints. The invariant hyperbola illustrates events separated from the origin by a spacelike interval of 1nbsp&m. The endpoints O and B measured when nbsp&=nbsp&0 are simultaneous events in the S′ frame. But to an observer <b>in</b> <b>frame</b> S, events O and B are not simultaneous. To measure length, the observer <b>in</b> <b>frame</b> S measures the endpoints of the rod as projected onto the x-axis along their world lines. The projection of the rod's world sheet onto the x axis yields the foreshortened length OC.|$|E

25|$|Originally it {{was thought}} that glycophorin C and D were the result of a gene {{duplication}} event but it was only later realised that they were encoded by the same gene. Glycophorin D (GPD) is generated from the glycophorin C messenger RNA by leaky translation at an <b>in</b> <b>frame</b> AUG at codon 30: glycophorin D = glycophorin C residues 30 to 128.
