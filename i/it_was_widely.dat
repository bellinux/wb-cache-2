5|$|Holmboe's {{significant}} impact on mathematics in the fledgling Norway was his textbook in two volumes for secondary schools. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>widely</b> used, but faced competition from Christopher Hansteen's alternative offering, sparking {{what may have been}} Norway's first debate about school textbooks.|$|E
5|$|After its {{victory in}} the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the British Empire was deeply in debt. Looking for new sources of revenue, the British Parliament sought, for the first time, to {{directly}} tax the colonies, beginning with the Sugar Act of 1764. The earlier Molasses Act of 1733, a tax on shipments from the West Indies, had produced hardly any revenue because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>widely</b> bypassed by smuggling, which {{was seen as a}} victimless crime.|$|E

5|$|Although the Richard III Society {{remained}} {{interested in}} discussing the possible location of the king's grave, they did not search for his remains. Individual members suggested possible lines of investigation, but neither the University of Leicester nor local historians and archaeologists took up the challenge, probably because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>widely</b> thought that the grave site had been built over or the skeleton had been scattered, as John Speed's account suggested.|$|E
5|$|Article 33 of the BSAC {{charter of}} 1889 gave the British {{government}} {{the right to}} alter or repeal any of the administrative provisions of the charter after 25 years. So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>widely</b> anticipated by all sections of southern African political opinion after 1910 that the BSAC's administration would {{come to an end}} in 1914. Yet the BSAC remained in place.|$|E

However, by early June it emerged that while {{she had left the}} Labour Party, she had not in fact joined the Conservatives and did not intend to.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, the {{documentary}} Life Itself was released. Director Steve James, whose films had been widely advocated by Ebert, started making it while the critic was still alive. The film studies Ebert's life and career, while also filming Ebert during his final months, and includes interviews {{with his family}} and friends. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>widely</b> praised.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>widely</b> {{believed}} the film would win {{most of its}} Oscar nominations, but it received only the award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay), shared by Welles and Mankiewicz. Variety reported that block voting by screen extras deprived Citizen Kane of Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actor (Welles), and similar prejudices were {{likely to have been}} responsible for the film receiving no technical awards.|$|E

5|$|Laika {{died within}} hours from overheating, {{possibly}} {{caused by a}} failure of the central R-7 sustainer to separate from the payload. The true cause and time of her death were not made public until 2002; instead, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>widely</b> reported that she died when her oxygen ran out on day six or, as the Soviet government initially claimed, she was euthanised prior to oxygen depletion.|$|E
5|$|On {{the next}} racing day, the other riders were {{reluctant}} to continue racing and asked the organisers for a postponement. French rider Jean Stablinski suggested that the race continue, with a British rider, whose team would wear black armbands, allowed to win the stage. Barry Hoban won the stage, This was later a subject of argument as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>widely</b> believed that the race winner should have been Denson, Simpson's other teammate and close friend.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} was {{opposed by the}} governments of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth. Religious, legal, political and moral objections were raised. As British monarch, Edward was the nominal head of the Church of England, which did not then allow divorced people to remarry in church if their ex-spouses were still alive. For this reason, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>widely</b> believed that Edward could not marry Simpson and remain on the throne. Simpson was perceived to be politically and socially unsuitable as a prospective queen consort because of her two failed marriages. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>widely</b> assumed by the Establishment that she was driven by love of money or position rather than love for the King. Despite the opposition, Edward declared that he loved Simpson and intended to marry her whether his governments approved or not.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Darwin, Wallace {{began his}} career as a {{travelling}} naturalist already believing in the transmutation of species. The concept had been advocated by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Erasmus Darwin, and Robert Grant, among others. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>widely</b> discussed, but not generally accepted by leading naturalists, and was considered to have radical, even revolutionary connotations.|$|E
5|$|Until the 19th century {{very little}} {{was known about}} hill forts, as none had been {{excavated}} and their original purpose had been long forgotten. In the medieval period, their construction was attributed variously to iconic figures such as King Arthur, King Alfred, the Danes, Julius Caesar, and even giants.

5|$|About {{two hours}} later, it became {{apparent}} that the badly coordinated uprising had failed, as the remaining 550 native soldiers refused to participate in the mutiny, instead helping to quell the rebellion. Some went into the town to protect French civilians and office buildings from attack. Three Vietnamese sergeants were subsequently awarded the Médaille militaire for their role in the suppression of the mutiny, while six other tirailleurs received the Croix de Guerre. The attack initially generated confusion among the French administration. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>widely</b> reported by the French media in Vietnam and Europe that the Indochinese Communist Party had organised the uprising.|$|E
5|$|According to Melman, Abu Nidal had {{recommended}} Hindawi to Syrian intelligence.

It was sent to London in a diplomatic bag and given to Hindawi. According to Seale, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>widely</b> believed that the attack {{was in response to}} Israel having forced down a jet, two months earlier, carrying Syrian officials to Damascus, which Israel had supposed was carrying senior Palestinians.|$|E
5|$|At the July 1945 general {{election}} Dunglass lost his Parliamentary {{seat in the}} landslide Labour victory. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>widely</b> assumed that as his father, the 13th earl, was in his seventies, Dunglass's political career was behind him, as he would soon inherit the earldom. There being at that time no provision for peers to disclaim their peerages, this would bring with it an obligatory seat in the House of Lords, with no option of remaining in the Commons, where most political power resided. Dunglass was appointed {{a director of the}} Bank of Scotland in 1946, and although he never considered banking as a long-term occupation he gained valuable first-hand experience in commerce and finance. He remained with the bank until 1951.|$|E
