The CSOs, intended for use in very rare occasions, were not covered by the existing legislation for waste emissions.|$|E
25|$|Until 1988, {{the park}} land had been privately owned. However, {{the area had}} been {{severely}} degraded with lakes and canals going dry and the salinity and pollution of the remaining water making farming nearly impossible. The pollution was primarily coming from the Buenaventura River, with carried with it <b>dirty</b> <b>water</b> from other rivers {{in the south of}} the city. By the 1980s, these chinampa farmers had been prohibited from growing any edible plants on their lands.|$|E

Despite this, it appears to have a fairly low tolerance to reduced salinities and is not found in estuaries themselves.|$|R

On March 14, 1473, during a {{dedication}} procession, a girl accidentally threw <b>dirty</b> <b>water</b> {{from the window}} of the house of one of the wealthiest conversos (the customary way to dispose of it.) The water splashed on an image of the Virgin being carried in procession in honor of a new society (from which conversos had been excluded by Bishop D. Pedro.) A local blacksmith started arousing a rabble against the Jews, who he blamed for the insult, which immediately joined in a fierce shout for revenge.|$|E
25|$|The Ganga Action Plan, {{which was}} taken on {{priority}} and with much enthusiasm, was delayed for two years. The expenditure was almost doubled. But {{the result was}} not very appreciable. Much expenditure was done over the political propaganda. The concerning governments and the related agencies were not very prompt {{to make it a}} success. The public of the areas was not taken into consideration. The releasing of urban and industrial wastes in the river was not controlled fully. The flowing of <b>dirty</b> <b>water</b> through drains and sewers were not adequately diverted. The continuing customs of burning dead bodies, throwing carcasses, washing of dirty clothes by washermen, and immersion of idols and cattle wallowing were not checked. Very little provision of public latrines was made and the open defecation of lakhs of people continued along the riverside. All these made the Action Plan a failure.|$|E

Alternative hypotheses include formation by collapses, or by flooding caused by cryovolcanism.|$|E
500|$|In the 18th century {{selective}} breeding of white common ducks {{led to a}} white domestic duck, generally known as the English White. Since at least the 1690s ducks had been farmed in Aylesbury, and raising English Whites became popular in Aylesbury and the surrounding villages. By 1813 it was remarked that [...] "ducks form a material article at market from Aylesbury and places adjacent: they are white, and as it seems of an early breed: they are bred and brought up by poor people, and sent to London by the weekly carriers". The duck farmers of Aylesbury {{went to great lengths}} to ensure the ducks retained their white colouring, keeping them clear of <b>dirty</b> <b>water,</b> soil with a high iron content and bright sunlight, all of which could discolour the ducks' feathers. Over time, {{selective breeding}} of the English White for size and colour gradually led to the development of the Aylesbury duck.|$|E
40|$|Sediment traps of <b>dirty</b> <b>waters</b> are, {{generally}} speaking, temporary hydrotechnical constructions {{associated with}} the purification of mine waters from mineral-organic suspensions. Once coal mining is finished and artificial supplies are cut off, such sediment traps – depending on hydrological and hydrotechnical conditions – undergo drainage or are utilised as water reservoirs. Drained sediment traps most commonly go {{through a period of}} self-generated reclamation – renaturalisation and become, similarly to water reservoirs, eco-hydrological objects. Bearing in mind the fact that the role of sediment traps is cleaning <b>dirty</b> <b>waters,</b> it seemed advisable to recognise the properties of sediments accumulated in them and to assess their impact on the arising plant communities. Two years after its closure, the entire area of the sediment trap (16 ha) was subjected to soil science and phytosociological investigation. Differentiated moisture content and soil conditions of the sediment tank surface were favourable for the settlement of various species characterised by differing site requirements which conferred a completely new quality to this post-industrial land and its biodiversity. The invasion of herbaceous and woody plants indicates that despite the function of sediment tank played earlier in the brown coalmine infrastructure, the material which was accumulated in it provided a favourable habitat for the development of plant cover. It may be assumed that it can be attributed to a significant admixture of brown coal...|$|R

Zhou Dunyi is known to have said that the best quality of life is that of a pure lotus growing out of <b>dirty</b> <b>waters,</b> where the lotus is the natural equivalent of the noble person.

500|$|During {{the second}} verse, a mad scientist, portrayed by Kinney, {{seemingly}} tortures Gaga, who {{is wearing a}} yellow dress with glasses made of barbwire, as another version of the singer, with teal-colored hair, performs a dance routine with her backup dancers in a barn. As the chorus begins for the second time, Gaga appears as Yüyi the Mermaid, with gills {{on her face and}} neck, as she lies in a tub filled with <b>dirty</b> <b>water.</b> At the end of the chorus, the camera zooms to a brunette Gaga inside a water tank while she sings [...] "You and I" [...] in the desert scene, and in the cornfield with Calderone. Interspersing scenes again show Gaga having her wedding, Yüyi in her tub, and Gaga seated on a chair with a conveyor belt. During May's guitar solo, Gaga dances in the cornfield with other dancers dressed in the same white dress, as Yüyi and the scientist kiss. While singing the chorus for the final time, Gaga kisses Calderone in one sequence and runs across the field in another. As the video reaches its conclusion, the tortured Gaga is being slid down as the conveyor belt turns on. The video ends with Yüyi and the scientist together in the bath tub, as a depiction of their dream wedding flashes across, before a last shot of the barn as the screen turns black.|$|E
500|$|Crawley's {{two main}} {{building}} firms had their yards {{and works in}} the Victorian streets near the railway line. [...] Richard Cook's firm, which built the houses and streets of the 19th-century [...] "New Town" [...] development, was founded in 1861 and was based {{at the corner of}} two of the new streets. [...] The works included a brickyard; poor drainage led to soil and <b>dirty</b> <b>water</b> from it polluting the surrounding area. [...] The Crawley and Ifield Vigilance Committee, an amateur pressure group, demanded improvements for several years, and proper drains were eventually laid. [...] Cook and Sons' advertisements revealed the range of products manufactured: the works made bricks, tiles, pipes and pottery, and his team of labourers carried out all types of building and contracting work. [...] James Longley and Sons became the most famous business in Crawley and one of its largest: in 1898 more than 700 people worked for it. [...] Longley moved his small firm from Turners Hill in 1881 when he bought Malthouse Farm and its brickworks. [...] Expansion was rapid, and they received commissions for Christ's Hospital school near Horsham, the King Edward VII sanatorium in Midhurst, Graylingwell Hospital in Chichester, the choir stalls in Westminster Abbey and almost every railway station owned by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway. [...] Longley and Sons, which soon became Longley and Company, quickly became one of southeast England's main building firms; but it was nearly ruined on 20 March 1924 when the joinery and timber works, all stock inside it and sixty machines were destroyed by fire. [...] The firm recovered, though, and was able to tender {{for a wide range of}} contracts in the New Town era, including Hazelwick School, much of the Manor Royal industrial estate, Crawley fire station, the Queen's Square shopping area and Crawley College's tower block extension.|$|E
