5|$|In flight, the red-throated loon has a {{distinctive}} profile; its small feet do not project far past {{the end of}} its body, <b>its</b> <b>head</b> and neck droop below the horizontal (giving the flying bird a distinctly hunchbacked shape) and its thin wings are angled back. It has a quicker, deeper wingbeat than do other loons.|$|E

5|$|Non-bluffing (aposematic) {{displays}} {{occur in}} mammals which possess powerful defences such as spines or stink glands, and which habitually warn off potential predators rather than attempting escape by running. The lowland streaked tenrec (Hemicentetes semispinosus) raises the spines on <b>its</b> <b>head</b> and back {{when confronted by}} a predator, and moves <b>its</b> <b>head</b> up and down. Porcupines such as Erethizon erect their long sharp quills and adopt a hunched, head-down posture when a predator is nearby. The spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) balances on its front legs, its body raised vertically with its bold pelage pattern conspicuously displayed, and its tail (near the scent glands) raised and spread out.|$|E
5|$|Observed in this species, the wing-fluttering {{display is}} seen in several situations: females responding, and presumably acquiescing, to male {{courtship}} displays, juveniles begging for food, by helpers to older birds, and immature males to senior ones. The fairywren lowers <b>its</b> <b>head</b> and tail, outstretches and quivers its wings and holds its beak open silently.|$|E

5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of Nigersaurus are grouped within the subfamily Nigersaurinae {{of the family}} Rebbachisauridae, {{which is part of}} the sauropod superfamily Diplodocoidea. Nigersaurus was probably a browser, and fed with <b>its</b> <b>head</b> close to the ground. The region of its brain that detected smell was underdeveloped, although its brain size was comparable to that of other dinosaurs. There has been debate on whether <b>its</b> <b>head</b> was habitually held downwards, or horizontally like other sauropods. It lived in a riparian habitat, and its diet probably consisted of soft plants, such as ferns, horsetails, and angiosperms. It is one of the most common fossil vertebrates found in the area, and shared its habitat with other dinosaurian megaherbivores, as well as large theropods and crocodylomorphs.|$|E

5|$|The heavy dagger-like bill is evenly tapered and greyish, {{sometimes}} {{having a}} black tip. The bill colour and angle distinguish this species from the yellow-billed loon. The neck {{is short and}} thick. It swims very low in the water, with sometimes only <b>its</b> <b>head</b> held above and horizontal to water. It must run across the water surface to get in flight. During flight, <b>its</b> <b>head</b> is slightly lower than its body, with its feet trailing behind. It has a skeletal structure {{made up of a}} number of solid bones (this is usual for the Gaviiformes and penguins but unlike most flying birds which have bones with extensive pneumatization, hollow and filled with air to make the lighter), which adds weight but helps in diving.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is quite terrestrial, hopping with <b>its</b> <b>head</b> held up and body erect; when excited, it will flick its wings and tail. The flight {{consists}} of undulating bounds interspersed with glides.|$|E
5|$|This rockfowl usually lives either {{alone or}} in pairs, {{although}} small flocks of three to ten birds are not uncommon. It normally moves through its habitat {{in a series of}} runs and long, springing hops on the ground and in low branches. It uses its tail for balance while hopping and running. When in a flock, rockfowl hop almost in unison. In the unusual occurrences when the species does fly, it is fast and is capable of navigating through the trees and rocks well. When it is standing still, the rockfowl has its tail down and <b>its</b> <b>head</b> looking up. Typically, it silently evades any unusual movements in their forest. However, if these birds know that they have been sighted, they can become quite inquisitive and occasionally approach observers. This is not a shy species once it knows that it has been seen, and often studies things of interest, including humans, from an open location. When this species is suspicious, it raises the small crown on <b>its</b> <b>head</b> and the ruff on its neck while uttering a muffled groan. It is most active in the early morning and late evening, and from 10:30 am to 7:00 pm remains perched with little activity either in liana-tangled areas or in caves away from the nests. To scratch <b>its</b> <b>head,</b> the species lifts its foot over <b>its</b> <b>head.</b> It bathes in small pools. While its lifespan in the wild is unknown, it has lived up to 25 years in captivity.|$|E
50|$|Usually {{the system}} {{consists}} of accelerometers that alert the system when excess acceleration or vibration is detected.

50|$|When perched the pied {{kingfisher}} often bobs <b>its</b> <b>heads</b> {{up and down}} and will sometimes raise its tail and flick it downwards. It calls often with sharp chirruk chirruk notes. Unlike some kingfishers, it is quite gregarious, and forms large roosts at night.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper formulates and solves a continuoustime {{version of}} the widely studied Vicsek {{consensus}} problem in which each agent independently updates <b>its</b> <b>heading</b> at times determined by its own clock. It is not assumed that the agents’ clocks are synchronized or that the “event ” times between which any one agent updates <b>its</b> <b>heading</b> are evenly spaced. Heading updates need not occur instantaneously. Using the concept of “analytic synchronization ” together with several key results concerned with properties of “compositions ” of directed graphs, it is shown that {{the conditions under which}} a consensus is achieved are essentially the same as those applicable in the synchronous discrete-time case provided the notion of an agent’s neighbor between its event times is appropriately defined.
