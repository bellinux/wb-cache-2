2500|$|For 1981, the Spirit sedan-based VAM Gremlin saw the {{greatest}} changes since 1979. Both versions obtained a 55-amp alternator, coolant recovery tank and <b>fan</b> <b>shroud</b> regardless of trim level or {{the presence of}} the air conditioning system, as well as a new shared grille design with vertical bars and a single horizontal one in the bottom plus a shared new seat pattern design. For the first time, door panels completely covered all previously exposed metal parts. International symbols appeared in the instrument cluster warning lights and the light beam switch was integrated to the steering column marker light lever. The Gremlin X received numerous updates. All chromed items were deleted other than the front end and rear licence plate light housings while the rear spoiler passed on to the option list. Both bumpers changed to blacked out units. Side decals were almost gone, with only a small [...] "Gremlin X" [...] one at the bottom corner of each C-pillar. A new leather-wrapped sports steering wheel with six simulated hex socket bolts on the horn button was used. A four speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage and a 3.07:1 rear gear ratio became standard. Units with automatic transmission retained the 3.31:1 rear gear ratio of all previous years. The optional equipment list now included eight-spoke sports-style steel wheels using the same volcano hubcaps as the standard wheels.|$|E
2500|$|The top of {{the line}} models were named American GFS (Concord DL two-door), American ECD (Concord DL four-door), and Camioneta American Automática (Concord DL wagon). All three {{featured}} automatic transmissions, power brakes, power steering, [...] six-cylinder (258 on ECD) with new-for-the-year Motorcraft two-barrel carburetor and 8.0:1 compression ratio, 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio, light group (courtesy, ashtray, glovebox, hood and trunk; the last one unavailable on the wagon), custom steering wheel, woodgrain panels on dashboard, parcel shelf, clock, retractable seat belts, luxury upholstery, tinted windshield, bright molding package (wheel arches, drip rails, rocker panels, front hood edge, hood ornament), engine displacement [...] "4.6" [...] emblems ("4.2" [...] on ECD), wheel covers, and bumper guards. The GFS model included a floor-shift transmission and reclining individual high-back seats, while the ECD and automatic wagon had column-shift coupled with a bench front seat. Both sedan models incorporated vinyl roof either in full form (ECD) or Landau type (GFS). The most unusual looking of these models in contrast with AMC's versions was the GFS model as it incorporated the flip-open rear side opera windows and the targa band used in the 1977 AMC Hornet AMX models (the same treatment used in the Hornet-based 1977 VAM American GFS). The optional equipment list on these models included air conditioning system with heavy duty cooling (seven-blade flexible fan, three-line radiator, <b>fan</b> <b>shroud,</b> coolant recovery tank and 55 amp alternator), reading dome light, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, passenger's side remote mirror, and rear defroster.|$|E
2500|$|The 1977 VAM Pacer {{was almost}} {{the same as in}} the {{previous}} year on the outside but even more luxurious on the inside. The largest difference between both models was in the seat designs. The Cassini pattern was replaced with a more discreet luxury design with a [...] "zigzag" [...] placement of plain soft buttons on the upholstery forming diagonal lines. The AM monaural radio was replaced by an AM/FM monaural unit, three-point retractable seatbelts took the place of the hip-only units, the glovebox obtained its respective light free of extra charge. Mechanically, the [...] engine obtained substantial engineering upgrades {{in the form of an}} all-new head design with improved cooling system and Quench-type combustion chambers, a higher 8.0:1 compression ratio and a new two-barrel aluminum intake manifold while the rear differential gear ratio changed from 3.31:1 to 3.07:1. This upgrade gave the VAM Pacer an estimated 12 net horse power increase over the previous year, meaning improved fuel economy and an improved top speed without losing torque and towing capacity. The year of 1977 was the first in which a VAM car could be ordered with a factory air conditioning system, the Pacer being no exception. Units equipped with the A/C obtained the complete set of five dashboard air vents and also included a 55-amp alternator, a flexible seven-bladed cooling fan, a three-line radiator, and a <b>fan</b> <b>shroud.</b> The previously optional luxury wheel covers were moved onto the standard equipment list.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{influence}} of shroud on aerodynamic characteristics and noise of a forward curved fan {{has been estimated}} by the performance test of an actual machine. Moreover, {{influence of}} unsteady internal flow on broadband noise in the low frequency domain has been analyzed by the numerical simulation. The static pressure of the forward curved <b>fan</b> with <b>shroud</b> (MF 9 S) became high {{than that of the}} <b>fan</b> without <b>shroud</b> (MF 9). The maximum efficiency of MF 9 S was increased 1. 6 % than MF 9 due to the improvement of the static pressure. On the other hand, the fan noise of MF 9 S at the maximum efficiency point became approximately 1 dB larger than MF 9 due to the influence on the broadband noise {{in the vicinity of the}} 200 Hz. The stalled cell was formed at the front side of the impeller of MF 9; the cell was rotated around the impeller with 40 % rotation speed of the impeller. The cell formed seven pseudo blades around the impeller. It has clarified that the broadband noise in the low frequency domain is generated at the vicinity of the frequency which is rotation speed of the stalled cell...|$|R
40|$|The {{cooling fan}} {{installation}} {{has become a}} critical feature since the power requirement for a typical heavy-duty truck engine fan {{is in no way}} negligible. Also it contributes in large amounts to the total noise emitted by the truck. In order to develop their products further, Volvo 3 p issued a Master Thesis Project to study the general behavior and performance of one of their current <b>fan</b> <b>shrouds</b> in a truck installation. The main purpose was a general study in order to further optimize the cooling performance of the truck. The tool to use was CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics), in the means of commercial available code. For this thesis ANSA together with the Star-CD package was used. In the optimization part, the primary objective was to optimize the mass flux through the radiator core, secondary considerations was uniformity of the flow. Generally the cooling performance increase the most if areas of low velocities are activated. With the limitations imposed by CFD kept in mind, such as turbulence models, discretization and under relaxation, this work suggest an availability of 27 % of improvement of the mass flux, corresponding cooling performance improvement is 13 %. This is for the default case of a fan speed of 1600 rpm and a pressure drop of 700 Pa, over the entire installatio...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} present a {{comparison}} between measured and CFD simulated fan performance characteristics of three different types of heavy duty truck fans. The test bench incorporates a <b>fan,</b> <b>fan</b> ring, <b>shroud</b> and 3 D engine blockage. The latter creates a severe constraint {{to the use of}} simplified 3 D CFD fan models (MRF-model). The results illustrates that the MRF methodology is consistent with test data for axial flow conditions up to fan transition, i. e. this methodology could be used for applications with a correctly installed axial fan. However after fan transition the methodology is not consistent any more...|$|R
2500|$|The Lerma is introduced, an {{original}} adaptation combining VAM American sedan with {{the rear of}} the smaller Rally creating a line of two- and four-door hatchbacks in a European style. The VAM American for 1981 in high trim included as standard equipment a rear defroster, reading dome lights, intermittent wipers, dual remote controlled mirrors, and AM/FM stereo radio. The option list now added a tilt steering column and power seats. All units had the AMC-designed Spirit grille for the year along with <b>fan</b> <b>shroud</b> and coolant recovery tank as standard equipment regardless of the presence of the air conditioning system. Appearance changes included [...] "Noryl" [...] wheel covers for the high trim versions. The base models were upgraded, and ordering any of the three body styles with automatic transmission now included as standard equipment: a quartz digital clock, retractable seat belts, tinted windshield, parcel shelf, full light group (except reading dome light), woodgrain panels applied on the dashboard, wheel trim rings, full bright molding package (hood, rocker panels, wheel lips, drip rails), and protective rubber side moldings aside from the already existing power steering and bumper guards. This meant a mid-range model between the standard basic units and the GFS/ECD/DL ones. This created for the first time an automatic base wagon that was not a DL. However, despite this change, VAM did not create any designation or distinction for the new better-equipped base models. In 1981 and 1982 there were four versions of the station wagon model: base manual, base automatic, basic DL, and equipped DL.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} the VAM Pacer was entirely {{different}} compared to the AMC Pacer. The car was focused to be a high-end luxury car from its introduction to its end, while American Motors counterpart started as an economy car and import fighter. This was reinforced after the first 200 units produced when the three-speed automatic transmission joined the standard equipment list, which by default created the addition of an [...] "Automático" [...] emblem on the bright rear panel. The VAM Pacer became the most costly and luxurious VAM car at the mid-year discontinuation of the 1976 Classic line. The uniqueness of the model coupled to its level of luxury and price range practically made the car a flagship for the company, {{even though it was}} never officially considered as such. Probably the most unusual aspect of the 1976 VAM Pacer lies in its seat designs. VAM created a design based on AMC's Oleg Cassini interior for the 1974–1975 Matador coupe that used not just in the Pacer but in all three VAM Classic models for the year. The Pacer's seats incorporated a golden Cassini crest on the adjustable headrests and a pattern with copper buttons forming squares. Unlike the AMC Pacer, the VAM Pacer had a very short list of factory optional equipment. These included rear wiper and washer, rear defroster, reading dome light, trunk cover, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, luxury wheel covers and heavy duty cooling system (seven-bladed flexible fan and <b>fan</b> <b>shroud).</b> An universal air conditioning system was available only as a dealership option among a few others not present in the factory list.|$|E
2500|$|The biggest {{news was}} the {{addition}} of a high-performance version of the two-door sedan called American 06/S. This model was characterized by the factory-modified [...] engine. Developed by VAM's engineering department, its net output was [...] at 4200 rpm and net torque was rated at [...] at 2600 rpm. The special model came standard with power brakes with front disks, power steering, front sway bar, heavy duty suspension (stiffer springs and shocks), TREMEC 170-F four-speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage, 3.31:1 rear differential gear ratio, heavy duty cooling (coolant recovery tank, <b>fan</b> <b>shroud,</b> seven-bladed flexible fan and three-line radiator), leather-wrapped three-arm sports steering wheel, reclining high-back bucket seats, dynamic three-point seat belts, center console with armrest and Rallye gauges (clock, vacuumeter, ammeter and oil pressure), digital tachometer, woodgrain panels on dashboard, parcel shelf, light group (except dome), AM radio with a passenger side rear quarter panel-mounted antenna, dual remote-controlled mirrors, high trim upholstery with map pouches and carpet inserts on the door panels, tinted windshield, blacked-out bumpers, VAM-designed sports steel grille, sports steel 14×6 wheels with blacked out volcano hubcaps, and D70×14 radial tires. The [...] "Hornet in Flames" [...] decal design used by AMC for the 1977 and 1978 AMXs was used in the 06/S over both the hood and trunk lid alongside large white [...] "06 / S" [...] decals over each quarter panel. Optional on this vehicle was a sunroof, rear defroster, reading dome light and AM FM radio. Only 499 units were produced, making it the most collectible Concord-based model for Mexico and practically the local equivalent of the 1971 Hornet SC/360 model. It was replaced with the Spirit coupe-based Rally GT model starting in 1980.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, a new custom 4130 chromoly frame helped address {{a lot of}} the visual balance issues and {{accommodated}} solutions to {{a lot of the}} mechanical balance issues. The heat shielding issues were solved and the large polished aluminum radiator was dressed up with a chrome <b>fan</b> and <b>shroud,</b> although some remove the shroud and prefer the more raw and muscular look. The radiator is still the Boss Hoss's weakest aesthetic feature, but there has been vast improvement. The 2006 models dress up the enormous radiator as well as or better than the much smaller radiators of other high-volume manufacturers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} an investigation to establish the impact of mistuning on the performance and design of blade-to-blade friction dampers of the type used to control the resonant response of turbine blades in gas turbine engines. In addition, it discusses the importance of friction slip force variations on the dynamic response of <b>shrouded</b> <b>fan</b> blades...|$|R
40|$|Two {{state of}} the art finite element {{reduction}} techniquespreviously validated against the direct finite element method,one based on classical modal analysis and another based oncomponent mode synthesis, are applied for efficient mistunedfree vibration and forced response analysis of several bladeddisk geometries. The methods are first applied to two testcases in order to demonstrate the differences in computationalefficiency as well as to validate the methods againstexperimental data. As previous studies have indicated, nonoticeable differences in accuracy are detected for the currentapplications, while the method based on classical modalanalysis is significantly more efficient. Experimental data(mistuned frequencies and mode shapes) available for one of thetwo test cases are compared with numerical predictions, and agood match is obtained, which adds to the previous validationof the methods (against the direct finite element method). The influence of blade-to-blade coupling and rotation speedon the sensitivity of bladed disks to mistuning is thenstudied. A transonic fan is considered with part span shroudsand without shrouds, respectively, constituting a high and alow blade-to-blade coupling case. For both cases, computationsare performed at rest as well as at various rotation speeds. Mistuning sensitivity is modelled as the dependence ofamplitude magnification on the standard deviation of bladestiffnesses. The finite element reduction technique based onclassical modal analysis is employed for the structuralanalysis. This reduced order model is solved for sets of randomblade stiffnesses with various standard deviations, i. e. MonteCarlo simulations. In order to reduce the sample size, thestatistical data is fitted to a Weibull (type III) parametermodel. Three different parameter estimation techniques areapplied and compared. The key role of blade-to-blade coupling,as well as the ratio of mistuning to coupling, is demonstratedfor the two cases. It is observed that mistuning sensitivityvaries significantly with rotation speed for both fans due toan associated variation in blade-to-blade coupling strength. Focusing on the effect of one specific engine order on themistuned response of the first bending modes, it is observedthat the mistuning sensitivity behaviour of the fan withoutshrouds is unaffected by rotation at its resonant condition,due to insignificant changes in coupling strength at thisspeed. The <b>fan</b> with <b>shrouds,</b> on the other hand, shows asignificantly different behaviour at rest and resonant speed,due to increased coupling under rotation. Comparing the twocases at resonant rotor speeds, the <b>fan</b> without <b>shrouds</b> is lessor equally sensitive to mistuning than the <b>fan</b> with <b>shrouds</b> inthe entire range of mistuning strengths considered. This thesis 9 ̆ 2 scientific contribution centres on themistuning sensitivity study, where the effects of shrouds androtation speed are quantified for realistic bladed diskgeometries. However, also the validation of two finite elementreduction techniques against experimental measurementsconstitutes an important contribution. NR 2014080...|$|R
2500|$|The 1981 {{model year}} {{represented}} a radical upgrade for VAM's top performance line. An all-new [...] "rally" [...] emblem design in all-lower case letters and computer-like typography appeared on both front fenders. The Rally AMX obtained a new [...] "waved" [...] stripe design {{located on the}} front edge of the hood and fenders with an integrated [...] "AMX" [...] leyend on the right front corner. It was very discreet compared to the last year's decals while the [...] "AMX over Rally" [...] and [...] "4.6 Litros" [...] stickers were removed. The Rally GT got also discreet [...] "GT" [...] stickers for the front of the hood bulge and [...] "GT 4.6/X" [...] stickers for the right corner of the rear spoiler. The previous year's [...] "American GT" [...] side decals and [...] "GT" [...] central rear spoiler emblem were deleted. Both versions shared all-new impressive Recardo-type reclining bucket seats with adjustable headrests, all new door panels in vinyl with cloth and carpet inserts but that no longer had map pouches, AMC's barred grille design used in the Eagle models made in aluminum instead of plastic, international symbols on the instrument cluster warning lights, the high beams switch integrated to the steering column, a new leather-wrapped sports steering wheel design with six fake Allen bolts on the horn button forming a hexagon, AM/FM stereo radio with four speakers as standard equipment and higher quality dashboard woodgrain panels. Mechanically, the coolant recovery tank and <b>fan</b> <b>shroud</b> became present. The optional equipment list was vastly improved; the set of power doorlocks and windows that debuted the year before in the American (Concord) line became available in the Rally. The GT got the electric antenna while the AMX included the rear spoiler with electric trunk release, both as standard equipment. The full optional equipment list for the Rally AMX was air conditioning, automatic transmission, intermittent wipers, reading dome light, rear defroster, sports steel wheels, electric antenna, power door locks and power windows; the list of the Rally GT was restricted to the electric locks and windows only {{while the rest of the}} accessories were standard except for the unavailable automatic transmission and air conditioning.|$|E
2500|$|The Rally-based Spirit liftbacks were {{available}} in two sports versions, the standard [...] "Rally AMX" [...] and the high performance [...] "Rally GT" [...] in their first year. Both versions came standard with a Transmission Technologies Corporation (Tremec) 176-F four-speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage, power brakes with front disks and rear drums, power steering, front and rear sway bars, heavy-duty shock absorbers and springs, seven-bladed flexible cooling fan, tinted windshield, leather-wrapped three-arm sports steering wheel, tachometer, center console with armrest and [...] "Rallye" [...] gauges plus rear ashtray, reclining bucket seats with adjustable headrests, split-back rear seat, three-point retractable seatbelts, woodgrain panels on dashboard, full light group (hood, courtesy, ashtray, glove box) except reading dome light, blacked-out dual remote-controlled mirrors and VAM-designed aluminum grille with a central [...] "Rally" [...] emblem. The Rally AMX had the standard [...] I6 using a 3.07:1 rear gear ratio, while the Rally GT came with the high-performance [...] version of this VAM engine and a 3.31:1 rear gear ratio. The heavy duty cooling system consisting of <b>fan</b> <b>shroud</b> and coolant recovery tank was optional on the AMX and standard on the GT, some units of this version came with a clutch fan instead of the regular belt-type. The Rally AMX was the [...] "base model" [...] {{of the line and}} the Rally GT was closer to the European tradition of performance cars with its analog tachometer (instead of the AMX's digital tach), while convenience items such as air conditioning or automatic transmission were not available. The GT model also included a rear spoiler with electric liftgate lock release and eight-spoke steel wheels (which were optional on the AMX). The AMX came with VAM's own design five-spoke wheels with trim rings and blacked-out volcano hubcaps. The marketing effort by VAM's sales department had most GT units be equipped from the factory with all the options originally intended to be extra cost, such as rear defroster, reading dome light, intermittent wipers, and AM FM stereo radio aside from the already mentioned steel wheels and rear spoiler. These items were all optional on the AMX.|$|E
5000|$|Miller {{opted for}} an unorthodox {{configuration}} {{in developing a}} racing aircraft that would be {{as fast as possible}} on [...] The JM-2 features a cantilever mid-wing, a single-seat enclosed open cockpit under a bubble canopy, tricycle landing gear with fixed main wheels and a retractable nose wheel, and a single engine in pusher configuration, mounted within a <b>fan</b> <b>shroud,</b> with the spinner acting as the aircraft's tailcone. The <b>fan</b> <b>shroud</b> structure provides a place to mount the rudders and the tailplane is mounted high in T-tail configuration {{as an extension of the}} shroud. There is a small canard surface mounted on the nose.|$|E
40|$|In {{the pursuit}} of ever more {{fuel-efficient}} engines, the fan diameter and bypass ratio are increasing rapidly. Although it allows the engine to perform more efficiently, it penalizes the aircraft performance with bigger nacelles, meaning more weight and bigger wetted drag-generating area. The nacelle design of such high bypass ratio engine is a problem, as the efficiency gain from the engine is counterbalanced, and sometimes eliminated by the nacelle weight and drag penalty. The paper presents a method that allows for a parametric design of two-dimensional axisymmetric nacelle geometry based on the shape function approach. An automated process is created that generates nacelle designs based on only a few parameters, meshes, and numerically computes the flow around the designed nacelles. A drag bookkeeping system is defined, and the nacelle drag is extracted from the simulation and analysed. The computed drag of nacelles, ranging from conventional length and thickness nacelles, through short/thin nacelles and ultrashort <b>fan</b> <b>shrouds</b> is analysed. Contrary to the first belief, ultrashort nacelles generate more drag than conventional length when the after-body drag-generating surfaces are considered. Furthermore, the study shows that shorter nacelle will greatly increase the flow velocity around the nacelle cowl and create a shock that induces wave drag. A boundary layer ingesting propulsor provides an alternative way to increase propulsive efficiency. The same automated design method was used to generate two differently sized propulsors mounted behind a fuselage, and the flow was numerically computed. In this case the flow around the nacelle cowl {{was found to be}} subsonic without shocks. The value of boundary pressure loss and ingested drag was shown to be predictable from the total pressure in the boundary layer on a similar fuselage without propulsor...|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{internal}} combustion engines are cooled by a closed circuit carrying liquid coolant through channels {{in the engine}} block and cylinder head, where the coolant absorbs heat, to a heat exchanger or radiator where the coolant releases heat into the air (or raw water, {{in the case of}} marine engines). Thus, while they are not ultimately cooled by the liquid, because of the liquid-coolant circuit they are known as water-cooled. In contrast, heat generated by an air-cooled engine is released directly into the air. (Direct Cooled Engine) Typically this is facilitated with metal fins covering the outside of the Cylinder Head and cylinders which increase the surface area that air can act on. Air may be force fed {{with the use of a}} <b>fan</b> and <b>shroud</b> to achieve efficient cooling with high volumes of air or simply by natural air flow with well designed and angled fins.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} validation of an analytical trailing-edge noise model dedicated to low-speed fans operating in free field. The model is intrinsically related to the aerodynamics of the blades and should lead to a useful fast-running tool {{to be included in}} a blade-design process in an industrial context. The investigations are made on a two-bladed low-speed axial <b>fan</b> without <b>shroud,</b> installed inside an anechoic room. The blades are instrumented with two sets of embedded small-size microphones (2. 5 mm diam), and the wall-pressure signals are acquired via a slip ring mounted on the fan axis. The chord-based Reynolds number is about 200, 000, and the tip Mach number about 0. 07. The data base is completed by far-field measurements made with a single microphone on a moving support. The analytical model is based on a previously published extension of Amiet's trailing-edge noise theory. A blade is split into several strips in the spanwise direction, and the model is applied to each strip. For this the input data are interpolated from the measurements performed with the aforementioned sets of microphones.

50|$|Large {{downdraft}} fans, usually {{powered by}} gasoline engines, {{are placed on}} top of open manholes {{at either end of}} the section to be tested. If possible all lines in the manholes except for the line between the manholes are partially blocked. Smoke is created using either a smoke bomb or liquid smoke. Smoke bombs are lit and placed on a grate or in a holder on top of each fan, while liquid smoke is injected into the fan via a heating chamber. The fans create a pressure differential that forces the smoke into the sewer at a pressure just above atmospheric. With properly installed plumbing, the traps will prevent the smoke from entering the house and redirect it out the plumbing vents. Defective plumbing systems or dry traps will allow smoke to enter the inside of the house.The area around the section being tested is searched for smoke plumes. Plumes coming from plumbing vents or the interface between the <b>fan</b> <b>shroud</b> and manhole rim are normal; however, smoke plumes outside of the manhole rim are not.

Mechanically, the 282 CID L engine obtained substantial engineering upgrades {{in the form of an}} all-new head design with improved cooling system and Quench-type combustion chambers, a higher 8.0:1 compression ratio and a new two-barrel aluminum intake manifold while the rear differential gear ratio changed from 3.31:1 to 3.07:1. This upgrade gave the VAM Pacer an estimated 12 net horse power increase over the previous year, meaning improved fuel economy and an improved top speed without losing torque and towing capacity. The year of 1977 was the first in which a VAM car could be ordered with a factory air conditioning system, the Pacer being no exception. Units equipped with the A/C obtained the complete set of five dashboard air vents and also included a 55-amp alternator, a flexible seven-bladed cooling fan, a three-line radiator, and a <b>fan</b> <b>shroud.</b> The previously optional luxury wheel covers were moved onto the standard equipment list.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Axial flow fan {{has been}} used for large amount of flow rate in air {{handling}} units of industrial application fields. The <b>fan</b> involves a <b>shrouding</b> duct as flow guidance for uniform flows. Pressure difference between before and ahead of rotating blades causes the flows movements. The case where the flow resistance such as a heat exchanger is located prior to the rotors is typical in-field model for several air conditioning systems. Main interest lies on the looking for an optimal position of axial fan in a circular duct. Experimental apparatus for fan performances and numerical research for detail analysis are adopted in this investigation in parallel. The optimal location of an axial fan is recognized by both no reverse flows and larger amount of flow rate in the down stream. All numerical data are validated by experimental measurements using a wind tunnel...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} NASA {{sponsored}} {{engine component}} improvement program, and fan package was developed {{to reduce fuel consumption}} in current CF 6 turbofan aircraft engine. The new fan package consist of an improved fan blade, reduced fan tip clearance due to a fan case stiffener, and a smooth <b>fan</b> casing tip <b>shroud.</b> CF 6 engine performance and acoustic tests demonstrated the predicted 1. 8 % improvement in cruise sfc without an increase in engine noise. Power management thrust/fan speed characteristics were defined. Mechanical and structural integrity was demonstrated in model fan rotor photoelastic stress tests, full-size fan blade bench fatigue tests, and CF 6 engine bird ingestion, crosswind, and cyclic endurance tests. The fan was certified in the CF 6 - 500 c 2 /E 2 engines and is in commerical service on the Boeing 747 - 200, Douglas DC- 10 - 30, and Atrbus industrie A 300 B aircraft...|$|R
40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} {{stability of}} titanium and composite blades of low aspect ratio is examined over {{a range of}} design parameters, using a Rayleigh-Ritz formulation. The blade modes include a plate-type mode to account for chordwise bending. Chordwise flexibility is {{found to have a}} significant effect on the unstalled supersonic flutter of low aspect ratio blades, and also on the stability of tip sections of <b>shrouded</b> <b>fan</b> blades. For blades with a thickness of less than approximately four percent of chord, the chordwise, second bending, and first torsion branches are all unstable at moderately high supersonic Mach numbers. For composite blades, the important structural coupling between bending and torsion cannot be modeled properly unless chordwise bending is accounted for. Typically, aft fiber sweep produces beneficial bending-torsion coupling that is stabilizing, whereas forward fiber sweep has the opposite effect. By using crossed-ply laminate configurations, critical aeroelastic modes can be stabilized...|$|R
5000|$|The Lerma is introduced, an {{original}} adaptation combining VAM American sedan with {{the rear of}} the smaller Rally creating a line of two- and four-door hatchbacks in a European style. The VAM American for 1981 in high trim included as standard equipment a rear defroster, reading dome lights, intermittent wipers, dual remote controlled mirrors, and AM/FM stereo radio. The option list now added a tilt steering column and power seats. All units had the AMC-designed Spirit grille for the year along with <b>fan</b> <b>shroud</b> and coolant recovery tank as standard equipment regardless of the presence of the air conditioning system. Appearance changes included [...] "Noryl" [...] wheel covers for the high trim versions. The base models were upgraded, and ordering any of the three body styles with automatic transmission now included as standard equipment: a quartz digital clock, retractable seat belts, tinted windshield, parcel shelf, full light group (except reading dome light), woodgrain panels applied on the dashboard, wheel trim rings, full bright molding package (hood, rocker panels, wheel lips, drip rails), and protective rubber side moldings aside from the already existing power steering and bumper guards. This meant a mid-range model between the standard basic units and the GFS/ECD/DL ones. This created for the first time an automatic base wagon that was not a DL. However, despite this change, VAM did not create any designation or distinction for the new better-equipped base models. In 1981 and 1982 there were four versions of the station wagon model: base manual, base automatic, basic DL, and equipped DL.|$|E
5000|$|The top of {{the line}} models were named American GFS (Concord DL two-door), American ECD (Concord DL four-door), and Camioneta American Automática (Concord DL wagon). All three {{featured}} automatic transmissions, power brakes, power steering, 282 CID L six-cylinder (258 on ECD) with new-for-the-year Motorcraft two-barrel carburetor and 8.0:1 compression ratio, 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio, light group (courtesy, ashtray, glovebox, hood and trunk; the last one unavailable on the wagon), custom steering wheel, woodgrain panels on dashboard, parcel shelf, clock, retractable seat belts, luxury upholstery, tinted windshield, bright molding package (wheel arches, drip rails, rocker panels, front hood edge, hood ornament), engine displacement [...] "4.6" [...] emblems ("4.2" [...] on ECD), wheel covers, and bumper guards. The GFS model included a floor-shift transmission and reclining individual high-back seats, while the ECD and automatic wagon had column-shift coupled with a bench front seat. Both sedan models incorporated vinyl roof either in full form (ECD) or Landau type (GFS). The most unusual looking of these models in contrast with AMC's versions was the GFS model as it incorporated the flip-open rear side opera windows and the targa band used in the 1977 AMC Hornet AMX models (the same treatment used in the Hornet-based 1977 VAM American GFS). The optional equipment list on these models included air conditioning system with heavy duty cooling (seven-blade flexible fan, three-line radiator, <b>fan</b> <b>shroud,</b> coolant recovery tank and 55 amp alternator), reading dome light, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, passenger's side remote mirror, and rear defroster.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} the VAM Pacer was entirely {{different}} compared to the AMC Pacer. The car was focused to be a high-end luxury car from its introduction to its end, while American Motors counterpart started as an economy car and import fighter. This was reinforced after the first 200 units produced when the three-speed automatic transmission joined the standard equipment list, which by default created the addition of an [...] "Automático" [...] emblem on the bright rear panel. The VAM Pacer became the most costly and luxurious VAM car at the mid-year discontinuation of the 1976 Classic line. The uniqueness of the model coupled to its level of luxury and price range practically made the car a flagship for the company, {{even though it was}} never officially considered as such. Probably the most unusual aspect of the 1976 VAM Pacer lies in its seat designs. VAM created a design based on AMC's Oleg Cassini interior for the 1974-1975 Matador coupe that used not just in the Pacer but in all three VAM Classic models for the year. The Pacer's seats incorporated a golden Cassini crest on the adjustable headrests and a pattern with copper buttons forming squares. Unlike the AMC Pacer, the VAM Pacer had a very short list of factory optional equipment. These included rear wiper and washer, rear defroster, reading dome light, trunk cover, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, luxury wheel covers and heavy duty cooling system (seven-bladed flexible fan and <b>fan</b> <b>shroud).</b> An universal air conditioning system was available only as a dealership option among a few others not present in the factory list.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{estimation}} of the performance and stability for a shrouded-fan unmanned rotorcraft whose mission profile also prescribes the flight in ground effect. The not so simple estimation of the aerodynamic coefficients and of the thrust in the various situations makes the performance calculation and the stability analysis difficult tasks. This {{is because of the}} strong interaction between the <b>fan</b> flow and <b>shroud</b> that causes quite different flow structures about the airframe depending on flight conditions. A further difficulty is related to the ground effect which produces substantial modifications in the rotor thrust and aerodynamic coefficients. To evaluate performance and stability, two models have been developed. One determines the aerodynamic coefficients of the shroud, whereas the other one calculates thrust and moment of the rotors system. Both models take into account the mutual interference between fan flow and fuselage and ground effect. Performance and stability are then discussed with reference to significant flight conditions...|$|R
40|$|The University Of Windsor/DaimlerChrysler Fan Test Facility {{is part of}} a {{study to}} develop a {{simplified}} numerical model for predicting the behaviour of automotive cooling fans. The facility could be used to validate computational fluid dynamic software. Three-dimensional velocity vector information is required on planes at specified axial locations downstream from the fan. The facility consists of a 3 m x 3 m x 3 m test chamber, which contains a <b>fan</b> and <b>shroud</b> combination located in the ceiling. The fan is attached to a vertical rotating shaft, which is driven by a variable speed DC motor arrangement. An X-array hot-wire probe is positioned, consecutively, at two downstream locations to determine the 3 components of velocity over the plane. The 2 ̆ 2 ram air 2 ̆ 2 effect is simulated by drawing additional air through the fan using a blower on the exhaust from the test chamber. An orifice plate is used to determine the overall flow rate through the facility. The entire operation is automated using a microcomputer and a multi input/output card. Operating conditions allow for flow rates between 0. 28 m 3 /s and 1. 133 m 3 /s with pressure differences across the fan of less than 2500 Pa. This thesis outlines the development of the physical facility and the associated computer software used to gather data. Sample results are presented in the form of velocity components, velocity magnitude, and volume flow rate versus pressure performance characteristics.

40|$|This paper dealswith the {{experimental}} validation of an analytical trailing-edge noisemodel dedicated to low-speed fans operating in free field. The model is intrinsically {{related to the}} aerodynamics of the blades and should lead to a useful fast-running tool {{to be included in}} a blade-design process in an industrial context. The investigations aremade on a two-bladed low-speed axial <b>fan</b> without <b>shroud,</b> installed inside an anechoic room. The blades are instrumented with two sets of embedded small-size microphones (2. 5 mm diam), and the wall-pressure signals are acquired via a slip ring mounted on the fan axis. The chord-based Reynolds number is about 200, 000, and the tip Mach number about 0. 07. The data base is completed by far-field measurements made with a single microphone on a moving support. The analytical model is based on a previously published extension of Amiet’s trailing-edge noise theory. A blade is split into several strips in the spanwise direction, and themodel is applied to each strip. For this the input data are interpolated from the measurements performed with the aforementioned sets of microphones. The trailing-edge noise model is more reliable for observer positions within 30 from the fan-rotation plane.
