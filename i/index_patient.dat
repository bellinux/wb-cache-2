40|$|Background-: Arrhythmogenic right {{ventricular}} dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is an {{autosomal dominant}} inherited disease with incomplete penetrance and variable expression. Causative mutations in genes encoding 5 desmosomal proteins {{are found in}} ≈ 50 % of ARVD/C <b>index</b> <b>patients.</b> Previous genotype-phenotype relation studies involved mainly overt ARVD/C <b>index</b> <b>patients,</b> so follow-up data on relatives are scarce. Methods and Results-: One hundred forty-nine ARVD/C <b>index</b> <b>patients</b> (111 male patients; age, 49 ± 13 years) according to 2010 Task Force criteria and 302 relatives from 93 families (282 asymptomatic; 135 male patients; age, 44 ± 13 years) were clinically and genetically characterized. DNA analysis comprised sequencing of plakophilin- 2 (PKP 2), desmocollin- 2, desmoglein- 2, desmoplakin, and plakoglobin and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to identify large deletions in PKP 2. Pathogenic mutations were found in 87 <b>index</b> <b>patients</b> (58 %), mainly truncating PKP 2 mutations, including 3 cases with multiple mutations. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification revealed 3 PKP 2 exon deletions. ARVD/C was diagnosed in 31 % of initially asymptomatic mutation-carrying relatives and 5 % of initially asymptomatic relatives of <b>index</b> <b>patients</b> without mutation. Prolonged terminal activation duration was observed more than negative T waves in V 1 to V 3, especially in mutation-carrying relatives < 20 years of age. In 45 % of screened families, ≥ 1 affected relatives were identified (90 % with mutations). Conclusions-: Pathogenic desmosomal gene mutations, mainly truncating PKP 2 mutations, underlie ARVD/C in the majority (58 %) of Dutch <b>index</b> <b>patients</b> and even 90 % of familial cases. Additional multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis contributed to discovering pathogenic mutations underlying ARVD/C.

40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} {{individuals}} are being referred to cardiogenetics outpatient clinics with potentially inherited arrhythmia (ARR) or cardiomyopathy (CM). To inform relatives at-risk, we ask <b>index</b> <b>patients</b> to distribute "family letters" containing {{information on the}} risks, possible genetic and other screenings, and preventive options. We assessed the responses to these letters in terms of referrals to a cardiologist and/or clinical geneticist. Fifty-six <b>index</b> <b>patients</b> were asked to distribute 249 family letters: 85 in the ARR group and 164 in the CM group. Within a mean follow-up period of 2 years (range 1 - 5 years) the number of relatives actually referred to the clinical geneticist and/or cardiologist was 57 % (142 of 249). There {{was a significant difference}} (P < 0. 01) between the ARR (80 %) and CM groups (45. 1 %). To verify the results obtained from our files at the cardiogenetics department we sent a questionnaire to 52 <b>index</b> <b>patients</b> (response 50 %). This showed that 23 / 26 (88 %) <b>index</b> <b>patients</b> bad distributed the letters to their relatives and that for 19 / 23 <b>index</b> <b>patients</b> one or more relatives had been screened. This is comparable with our files, which showed that 57 % of relatives of <b>index</b> <b>patients</b> with a potentially inherited cardiac disease underwent screening, particularly in the ARR group. The actual response was underestimated because some relatives were investigated elsewhere or may still decide to be screened in the future. We conclude that distributing family letters is an effective way to inform and encourage relatives to undergo screening for high-risk inherited cardiac disease. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, In...|$|R
40|$|The risk of {{recurrence}} of Hirschsprung's disease in sibs is reasonably well established. Survivors of early successful operations (rectosigmoidectomy) are now reaching adult life and are asking about risks to their children. The authors report a preliminary study {{on which to}} base a risk estimate. Studies on sibs show that for short segment <b>index</b> <b>patients</b> the risk to brothers is about 1 in 20 and for sisters about 1 in 100. For long segment patients the risk is about 1 in 10 irrespective of sex. In the present study it was found that one son in 52 was possibly affected, and one daughter in 47 was certainly affected, of short segment <b>index</b> <b>patients.</b> Of long segment <b>index</b> <b>patients</b> one son in three was probably affected, and the one daughter was certainly affected. One long segment patient had a child with a short segment affected and one short segment patient had a child with a long segment affected. This confirms the impression, given by single case reports of parent and child affected, that there is less likelihood of concordance in length of aganglionic segment in parent and child than in sibs. For the present it is appropriate to give an estimated risk of about 2 % for offspring of short segment <b>index</b> <b>patients,</b> but a relatively higher risk for offspring of long segment <b>index</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R

5000|$|POR {{deficiency}} is {{the newest}} form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia first described in 2004. The <b>index</b> <b>patient</b> was a newborn 46,XX Japanese girl with craniosynostosis, hypertelorism, mid-face hypoplasia, radiohumeral synostosis, arachnodactyly and disordered steroidogenesis. However, the clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients with POR deficiency are long known in the literature as so-called mixed oxidase disease, as POR deficiency typically shows a steroid profile that suggests combined deficiencies of steroid 21-hydroxylase and 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase activities. The clinical spectrum of POR deficiency ranges from severely affected children with ambiguous genitalia, adrenal insufficiency, and the Antley-Bixler skeletal malformation syndrome (ABS) to mildly affected individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome-like features. Some of the POR patients were born to mothers who became virilized during pregnancy, suggesting deficient placental aromatization of fetal androgens due to a lesion in microsomal aromatase resulting in low estrogen production, which was later confirmed by lower aromatase activities caused by POR mutations. However, {{it has also been}} suggested that fetal and maternal virilization in POR deficiency might be caused by increased dihydrotestosterone synthesis by the fetal gonad through an alternative [...] "backdoor" [...] pathway first described in the marsupials and later confirmed in humans [...] Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of urinary steroids from pregnant women carrying a POR-deficient fetus described in an earlier report also supports the existence of this pathway, and the relevance of the [...] "backdoor" [...] pathway along with POR dependent steroidogenesis have become clearer from recent studies. The role of POR mutations beyond CAH are being investigated; and questions such as how POR mutations cause bony abnormalities and what role POR variants play in drug metabolism by hepatic P450s are being addressed in recent publications. However, reports of ABS in some offsprings of mothers who were treated with fluconazole, an antifungal agent which interferes with cholesterol biosynthesis at the level of CYP51 activity - indicate that disordered drug metabolism may result from deficient POR activity.|$|E

40|$|Background: Despite the use {{of genetic}} services, counselees do not always share {{hereditary}} cancer information with at-risk relatives. Reasons for not informing relatives may be categorized as a lack of: knowledge, motivation, and/or self-efficacy. Purpose: This study aims to develop and test {{the psychometric properties of}} the Informing Relatives Inventory, a battery of instruments that intend to measure counselees’ knowledge, motivation, and self-efficacy regarding the disclosure of hereditary cancer risk information to at-risk relatives. Method: Guided by the proposed conceptual framework, existing instruments were selected and new instruments were developed. We tested the instruments’ acceptability, dimensionality, reliability, and criterion-related validity in consecutive <b>index</b> <b>patients</b> visiting the Clinical Genetics department with questions regarding hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer or colon cancer. Results: Data of 211 <b>index</b> <b>patients</b> were included (response rate[*]=[*] 62 %). The Informing Relatives Inventory (IRI) assesses three barriers in disclosure representing seven domains. Instruments assessing index patients’ (positive) motivation and self-efficacy were acceptable and reliable and suggested good criterion-related validity.

Conclusions These SNPs are the first common, low-penetrant variants reported to be associated with adenomatous polyposis not caused by a defect in the APC, MUTYH, POLD 1 and POLE genes. Even though familial occurrence of polyposis was very rare, CRC was over-represented in FDRs of polyposis patients and, if confirmed, these relatives will therefore benefit from surveillance...|$|R
40|$|Background. Large {{clinical}} trials {{have demonstrated the}} therapeutic efficacy of oseltamivir against influenza. We assessed the indirect effectiveness of oseltamivir in reducing secondary household transmission in an incident cohort of influenza <b>index</b> <b>patients</b> and their household members. Methods. We recruited index outpatients whose rapid test results were positive for influenza from February through September 2007 and January through September 2008. Household contacts were followed up for 7 - 10 days during 3 - 4 home visits to monitor symptoms. Nose and throat swabs were collected and tested for influenza by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction or viral culture. Results. We followed up 384 <b>index</b> <b>patients</b> and their household contacts. <b>Index</b> <b>patients</b> who took oseltamivir within 24 h of symptom onset halved the time to symptom alleviation (adjusted acceleration factor, 0. 56; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 42 - 0. 76). Oseltamivir treatment {{was not associated with}} statistically significant reduction in the duration of viral shedding. Household contacts of <b>index</b> <b>patients</b> who had taken oseltamivir within 24 h of onset had a nonstatistically significant lower risk of developing laboratory-confirmed infection (adjusted odds ratio, 0. 54; 95 % CI, 0. 11 - 2. 57) and a marginally statistically significant lower risk of clinical illness (adjusted odds ratio, 0. 52; 95 % CI, 0. 25 - 1. 08) compared with contacts of <b>index</b> <b>patients</b> who did not take oseltamivir. Conclusions. Oseltamivir treatment is effective in reducing the duration of symptoms, but evidence of household reduction in transmission of influenza virus was inconclusive. © 2010 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
