KGM developed relatively good <b>dry</b> bond <b>strength</b> in extremely small solid amounts, irrespective of alkaline treatment. However, the water resistance was extremely low {{for all of}} the conditions.

When KGM and chitosan were combined, the adhesiveness under the dry condition was enhanced, and the bonding properties were superior to those of casein and soybean glues. Therefore, it is expected that chitosan and chitosan–KGM composite can be used as environmentally friendly wood adhesives.|$|R
