5|$|The Varaha, in the 83 {{verses of}} Chapter 2, {{explains}} to Ribhu {{how to achieve}} the most exalted knowledge of Brahmavidya, and then what <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>He</b> tells Ribhu that the four means of this knowledge are to practice conduct of one's Varna (caste) and one's Ashrama (stage in life), from ascetic austerity {{and with the help}} of a Guru (spiritual teacher). The Varaha then states that the path to Brahmavidya is through the capacity to distinguish between the ephemeral and the eternal, detachment from the material world unto the spiritual world. A sincere longing for spiritual liberation and six virtuous qualities (shama) are essential in order to achieve Brahmavidya, asserts the Upanishad, these being tranquility, self-restraint, doing work without craving for rewards, endurance, faith, and meditation. Varaha states in verse 2.4 that the truly blessed are those who know Brahman and Atman and have thus become one with them.|$|E

5|$|Ti Noel is well {{established}} early on as not only a witness to events, but also as someone who makes observations and offers reflection. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> who considers slavery under Henri Christophe worse than that under French rule because blacks are now enslaving fellow blacks. It is also he who offers reflections about the difficulty of this world allowing {{for the possibility of}} greatness during the concluding remarks of the novel. His perspective represents that of the folk, including his belief in the African gods.|$|E
5|$|Character {{designer}} Tetsuya Nomura {{has explained}} that Vincent's character shifted {{from that of}} horror researcher, to detective, to chemist, and finally to {{the figure of a}} former Turk with a tragic past. Director Yoshinori Kitase {{was in charge of the}} cutscene in which Vincent joins the party, while scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wrote his backstory. Nojima had a great deal of trouble with Vincent's dialogue, as he very rarely speaks. In the original script of the game, Vincent was introduced in a similar fashion, but was a handsome, sarcastic personality. He would join Cloud's group after learning they were in pursuit of Hojo, but he had no knowledge of the results of the experimentation to which he was subjected. Additionally, he would be also privy to more information regarding Shinra's involvement with the creation of Sephiroth, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> who would explain to Cloud the story of Sephiroth's origins. When the game was still in development, Nomura and his staff considering removing Vincent and Yuffie Kisaragi altogether, as they did not have enough time to work them into the story properly. As a result, Vincent and Yuffie ultimately appeared as optional characters in the game.|$|E
5|$|Toriyama was {{commissioned}} {{to illustrate the}} characters and monsters for the first Dragon Quest video game (1986) in order to separate it from other role-playing games of the time. He has since worked on every title in the series. For each game Yuji Horii first sends rough sketches of the characters with their background information to Toriyama, who then re-draws them. Lastly, Horii approves the finished work. Toriyama explained in 1995 that for video games, because the sprites are so small, {{as long as they}} have a distinguishing feature so people can tell which character <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>he</b> can make complex designs without concern of having to reproduce it like he usually would in manga. Besides the character and monster designs, Toriyama also does the games' packaging art and, for , the boats and ships. The series' Slime character, which has become a sort of mascot for the franchise, is considered to be one of the most recognizable figures in gaming.|$|E
60|$|Running at the {{forefront}} of the pack was a large grey wolf--one of its several leaders. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> who directed the pack's course on the heels of the she-wolf. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> who snarled warningly at the younger members of the pack or slashed at them with his fangs when they ambitiously tried to pass him. And <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> who increased the pace when he sighted the she-wolf, now trotting slowly across the snow.|$|R

25|$|Yedigei is {{the main}} protagonist. He is a railway worker on the Sarozek who was once {{a soldier in the}} second World War and before that, a {{fisherman}} on the Aral Sea. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> who undertakes the responsibility for Kazangap's burial and most of the story is told from his perspective.|$|E
25|$|He adapted a book, In the Spring the War Ended, into a {{screenplay}} {{but it was}} not filmed. Neither were scripts he did of The Thing of It Is and Papillon.

25|$|News Knight {{is about}} the news {{broadcast}} that McDonald has always wanted to do. As a result, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> who sets the news agenda. This is mainly {{in the form of}} McDonald's top three stories of the week, which are discussed with the panel. Therefore, it is more akin to a traditional news broadcast rather than a talk show, but with a comic agenda.|$|E
60|$|But <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> further, {{the fiercest}} of the litter. He {{could make a}} louder rasping growl than any of them. His tiny rages were much more terrible than theirs. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> that first learned the trick of rolling a fellow- cub over with a cunning paw-stroke. And <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> that first gripped another cub by the ear and pulled and tugged and growled through jaws tight-clenched. And {{certainly}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> that caused the mother the most trouble in keeping her litter {{from the mouth of}} the cave.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he told us}} anecdotes of how he {{had gone}} across the Channel when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so rough that the {{passengers}} had to be tied into their berths, and he and the captain {{were the only two}} living souls on board who were not ill. Sometimes <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> and the second mate who were not ill; but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> generally <b>he</b> and one other man. If not he and another man, then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> by himself.|$|R
60|$|The chief {{figure at}} the wedding of Miss Ailie was {{undoubtedly}} Mr. T. Sandys. When one remembers his prominence, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> difficult to think th{{at the wedding}} could have taken place without him. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> (in his Sabbath clothes again, and now flaunting his buttonhole brazenly) who in insulting language ordered the rabble to stand back there. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> who dashed out to the 'Sosh to get a hundred ha'pennies for the fifty pennies Mr. McLean had brought to toss into the air. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> who went round in the carriage to pick up the guests and whisked them in and out, and slammed the door, and saw to it that the minister was not kept waiting, and warned Miss Ailie that if she did not come now they should begin without her. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> who stood near her with a handkerchief ready in his hand lest she took to crying on her new brown silk (Miss Ailie was married in brown silk after all). As a crown to his audacity, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> who told Mr. Dishart, {{in the middle of a}} noble passage, to mind the lamp.|$|R
25|$|There is no {{election}} pitting Paul Garrett against Morgan Wendell in the novel. Wendell {{is elected}} Commissioner of Resources, and Garrett reluctantly accepts his offer {{to be his}} principal deputy. The novel also portrays Morgan Wendell as a more reasonable and balanced man than what is depicted in the miniseries. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>he,</b> not Paul Garrett, who makes the reference to Warren G. Harding as the anti-standard by which all politicians should be judged.|$|E
25|$|Leslie is {{the male}} lizard who {{appears at the}} end of act I. Like Charlie, Leslie is a bit more fearful, defensive, and mistrusting than his mate. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> who first watches the human couple. Leslie is also the first to {{approach}} Nancy and Charlie, poking them in the side. When Charlie does not reply right away, Leslie becomes frustrated. While Leslie's guard remains high, especially around Charlie, for most of the play, he is also curious, much more so than his human male counterpart.|$|E
25|$|Nowhere has Channel Nine {{ever talked}} the one-day game down, nowhere have we ever {{said this is}} a 'B team'. It's rubbish and George should stick to playing cricket and leave (television) rights to the people who know what they're talking about. I reckon he's got his hands full as <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>He</b> needs to {{concentrate}} on staying in the side. And he needs to understand where his money's coming from. Without the TV rights deal, George is probably working in a coalmine or flipping burgers at McDonald's.|$|E

50|$|With {{a working}} life that spanned fifty years, Sergei Levitsky {{distinguished}} {{himself in the}} technical sphere of photographic development. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> who designed a bellows camera which significantly improved the process of focusing, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> who introduced interchangeable decorative backgrounds, {{as well as the}} retouching of negatives to reduce or eliminate technical deficiencies.|$|R
25|$|Of course, we may {{expect to}} hear more about this part of the question; but even supposing Sir Morton Peto's apology to be true in point of fact, what a pitiful apology <b>it</b> <b>is!</b> <b>He,</b> an {{experienced}} man of business, and the regular financial adviser to the company, disclaims all responsibility for unjustifiable financial actions, if only the company's solicitors tell hint that it is all right. Surely it is not a legal question, but a moral question, whether it is permissible to concoct fictitious documents for the purpose of evading the provisions of an Act of Parliament.|$|E
25|$|It {{opens with}} the arrival of a {{messenger}} in Susa, the Persian capital, bearing news of the catastrophic Persian defeat at Salamis to Atossa, the mother of the Persian King Xerxes. Atossa then travels to the tomb of Darius, her husband, where his ghost appears to explain the cause of the defeat. <b>It</b> <b>is,</b> <b>he</b> says, the result of Xerxes' hubris in building a bridge across the Hellespont, an action which angered the gods. Xerxes appears {{at the end of the}} play, not realizing the cause of his defeat, and the play closes to lamentations by Xerxes and the chorus.|$|E
25|$|The dalang, {{sometimes}} referred to as Dhalang or Kawi Dalang, is the puppeteer artist behind the entire performance. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> who sits behind the screen, sings and narrates the dialogues of different characters of the story. With a traditional orchestra in the background to provide a resonant melody and its conventional rhythm, the dalang modulates his voice to create suspense thus heightening the drama. Invariably, the play climaxes with the triumph of good over evil. The dalang is highly respected in Indonesian culture for his knowledge, art and as a spiritual person capable of bringing to life the spiritual stories in the religious epics.|$|E

25|$|The {{ordinary}} {{cannot be}} a bishop if married or with dependent children. In that case, while not having episcopal holy orders, {{in particular the}} power to ordain to the diaconate, priesthood and episcopacy, he has the powers and privileges of other prelates who are canonically equivalent to diocesan bishops, such as territorial prelates. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> who by issuing dimissorial letters admits candidates to holy orders, having first obtained {{the consent of the}} governing council. As an ordinary, he may personally install such candidates in the preliminary ministries of lectorate and acolytate. Like other equivalents of diocesan bishops, he is a full member of the episcopal conference and may use certain episcopal symbols, such as mitre, crosier, ring, pectoral cross, zucchetto, choir dress with purple cassock.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Fanta, he {{can recall}} his father, but {{chooses not to}} tell Fanta of their father to protect her. It is {{revealed}} that Fanta's memories were erased once she arrived in Avalon, but Oran ensured that she and Pain would not. He and his mother do not get along and merely tolerate one another, though Oran admits to Fanta that she favors Pain over Fanta because her happiest memories in the human world were before Fanta was born, when Pain was growing up. While Pain strongly dislikes his mother-he refuses to call her 'mother', and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> who gathered up evidence against Oran's crimes- he has some warm emotions towards her in truth. When Sangjae asks Pain to permit killing of Oran to save the faery world, Pain refuses.|$|E
25|$|If an adjudicator has a pecuniary or {{monetary}} {{interest in}} the matter {{he or she is}} presiding over, no matter how small <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>he</b> or she is automatically disqualified from making the decision. The decision, if made, may be set aside. Thus, in Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal Proprietors (1852), the House of Lords held that the Lord Chancellor, who was a shareholder of one of the companies that was a party to certain legal proceedings he was presiding over, was disqualified from hearing the case. His ruling had to be annulled. This was not because there was a real possibility of bias, but because the situation created a possibility that a reasonable person might suspect the existence of bias, which would taint the fairness of the proceedings.|$|E

60|$|For a {{while there}} was silence, till {{suddenly}} a sound was heard in the dark sanctuary where stood the statue of the god, a sound as of a stick tapping upon the granite floor. Then the curtains of that sanctuary were drawn, and standing between them there appeared the figure of an ancient, bearded man, with stony eyes, who was clad in a beggar's robe. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> who had met Tua and Asti in the wilderness and eaten up their food. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> who had saved them in the palace of the desert king. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> who but last night had walked the camp of Abi.|$|R
