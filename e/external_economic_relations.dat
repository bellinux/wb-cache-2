40|$|This paper aims at {{showing how}} a link has been {{progressively}} established between the <b>economic</b> <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> of the European Communities and {{the decisions taken}} by the member states in the European political cooperation (EPC) process. EPC has been now transformed into a common foreign and security policy (CFSP) by the treaty on European Union. Before discussing the efficiency or the consistency of political conditionality in EC <b>economic</b> <b>external</b> <b>relations,</b> {{the purpose of this}} paper is to investigate the political and legal aspects of the building of a link between EC and EPC/CFSP in the international arena. Therefore, one has to make some preliminary remarks to recall the origin of CFSP and to grasp the nature of such a "common" policy. We will then move on to the most striking aspect of the EC-EPC/ CFSP linkage: the economic sanctions issue. Afterwards, we will point out some consequences of the EC economic sanctions practice (positive economic measures or regulation concerning the export of dual-use goods), and finally, we will try to assess the recurring presence of a kind of democratic conditionality in the <b>economic</b> <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> of the EU...|$|R

While {{existing}} literature has mostly adopted national viewpoints and a socioeconomic perspective, this book integrates these existing fragmented analyses, views them from a broader perspective and places them in the wider context of the social and demographic transformation of Europe and the political and economic narrative of continental integration.

By showing that migration policies and their impact on European national societies and economies cannot be fully understood without taking into account the EC framework, this book, therefore, contributes to migration studies as a whole...|$|R
