5|$|Ceres {{promises}} that {{only during the}} time when Proserpine lives with her will the earth be <b>fertile.</b>|$|E
5|$|Every {{species is}} <b>fertile</b> enough {{that if all}} {{offspring}} survived to reproduce, the population would grow (fact).|$|E
5|$|Mechanisms {{suggested}} for egg discrimination in worker policing include queen hydrocarbons, <b>fertile</b> worker hydrocarbons, and nestmate recognition.|$|E
5|$|Most of Lower Silesia is {{a rolling}} plain of <b>fertile</b> land. It {{includes}} black and alluvial soils near Breslau (Wrocław) and in river valleys, mixed with more sandy soils. Located between the Oder {{river and the}} foot of the Sudeten Mountains, its mild climate, <b>fertile</b> soils and extensive water network made it a coveted agricultural resource.|$|E
5|$|Nestlings, fledglings, and juveniles have brown plumage and pink-brown {{bills with}} shorter tails than adults. Young males develop blue tail {{feathers}} and darker bills by late summer or autumn (following a spring or summer breeding season), while young females develop light blue tails. By the subsequent spring, all males are <b>fertile</b> and have developed cloacal protuberances, which store sperm. In contrast, during the breeding season, <b>fertile</b> females develop oedematous brood patches, which are bare areas on their bellies.|$|E
5|$|Ox Ool {{is located}} in the hill country a few {{kilometers}} south of Motul de San José, and has <b>fertile</b> soil for agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Southwestern Ontario is flat, {{primarily}} agricultural land, {{that takes}} advantage of the <b>fertile</b> clay soil deposited throughout the region.|$|E
5|$|Stroma is {{bisected}} by a fault {{which runs}} in a north-south direction through its centre, intersected by another fault running in an east-northeast direction across {{the north of the}} island. The soil {{on either side of the}} fault line is significantly different; the eastern and southern parts of Stroma are covered by <b>fertile</b> clay fed by bedrock minerals, while less <b>fertile</b> boggy ground predominates on the west side.|$|E
5|$|The local legend {{suggests}} that the Cailleach and her family were given shelter in the glen by the locals and while they stayed there the glen was always <b>fertile</b> and prosperous. When they left they gave the stones to the locals with the promise {{that as long as}} the stones were put out to look over the glen at Bealltainn and put back into the shelter and made secure for the winter at Samhainn then the glen would continue to be <b>fertile.</b>|$|E
5|$|The most <b>fertile</b> period (the {{time with}} the highest {{likelihood}} of pregnancy resulting from sexual intercourse) covers the time from some 5 days before until 1 to 2 days after ovulation. In a 28‑day cycle with a 14‑day luteal phase, this corresponds to the second {{and the beginning of}} the third week. A variety of methods have been developed to help individual women estimate the relatively <b>fertile</b> and the relatively infertile days in the cycle; these systems are called fertility awareness.|$|E
5|$|When the LIFE {{project was}} first proposed, it {{focused on the}} nuclear fusion–fission hybrid concept, which uses the fast {{neutrons}} from the fusion reactions to induce fission in <b>fertile</b> nuclear materials. The hybrid concept was designed to generate power from both <b>fertile</b> and fissile nuclear fuel and to burn nuclear waste. The fuel blanket was designed to use TRISO-based fuel cooled by a molten salt made from a mixture oflithium fluoride(LiF) andberyllium fluoride(BeF2).|$|E

5|$|Afterwards, {{says the}} völva, the sky will turn black before fire engulfs the world, the stars will disappear, flames will dance before the sky, steam will rise, {{the world will}} be covered in water and then it will be raised again, green and <b>fertile.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aspleniummontanum is a small, {{evergreen}} fern which {{grows in}} tufts. The leaves are bluish-green and highly divided, proceeding {{from a long}} and often drooping stalk. A.montanum is monomorphic, with no difference in form between sterile and <b>fertile</b> fronds.|$|E
5|$|Carmarthenshire is {{a county}} of rich, <b>fertile</b> {{farmland}} and productive seas and estuaries, {{that give the}} county a range of foods that motivate many home cooks and restaurateurs. Carmarthenshire has ambitions to become the premier food-producing county of Wales, based on its strong reputation for first class products.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} post-independence period, an {{important}} share of Argentina's exports came from cattle and sheep production. The livestock-raising economy {{was based upon}} the abundance of <b>fertile</b> land in the littoral provinces. Cropping apparently lacked comparative advantage compared to livestock grazing.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{study which}} used {{endogenous}} retrovirus markers {{to investigate the}} history of sheep domestication found the Jacob to be more closely linked to sheep from Africa and South-west Asia than to other British breeds, though all domestic breeds {{can be traced back}} to an origin the <b>Fertile</b> Crescent.|$|E
5|$|In {{colonies of}} the ponerine ant, Pachycondyla inversa, workers eat the eggs of <b>fertile</b> female workers, known as gamergates, and display {{aggressive}} behavior towards egg-laying females.|$|E
5|$|M. nigrocincta is a gamergate species, {{which allows}} female workers to be <b>fertile,</b> {{and these are}} then able to {{reproduce}} in both queenless and queenright (colonies with a queen) colonies. This means a colony which loses its queen can still thrive {{in the absence of}} the queen. In laboratory colonies of M. nigrocincta where there was no queen present, worker-laid eggs were reared to mature males, showing that workers are highly <b>fertile.</b> The average life expectancy of an adult worker M. nigrocincta ant is 1.1 to 1.2 years, with a maximum expectancy of 1.3 years (400 or more days). Larvae collected from M. nigrocincta are 4.7mm in length but increase to 9.7mm when matured.|$|E
5|$|Nescopeck Creek {{is in the}} {{geological}} region known as the Ridge and Valley region. This region is characterized by <b>fertile</b> valleys and steep ridges. However, the eastern reaches of the Nescopeck Creek watershed are near {{the border of the}} Appalachian Plateau region.|$|E
5|$|Plant species often {{hybridize}} {{more readily}} than animal species, and the resulting hybrids are <b>fertile</b> more often. Many plant species {{are the result of}} hybridization, combined with polyploidy, which duplicates the chromosomes. Chromosome duplication allows orderly meiosis and so viable seed can be produced.|$|E
5|$|The colonial {{government}} {{discovered that there}} was <b>fertile</b> terrain in the islands of Mona and Monito in 1856. After the discovery, they selected Baldorioty de Castro as the supervisor {{of a series of}} experiments to determine the terrain's components.|$|E
5|$|The comet {{was also}} <b>fertile</b> ground for hoaxes. One that reached major {{newspapers}} {{claimed that the}} Sacred Followers, a supposed Oklahoma religious group, attempted to sacrifice a virgin {{to ward off the}} impending disaster, but were stopped by the police.|$|E
5|$|The development, eruption, {{and close}} {{monitoring}} of Axial Seamount provided a <b>fertile</b> model on submarine volcanic eruptions to scientists; several scientific {{papers on the}} topic were published soon after.|$|E
5|$|The only <b>fertile</b> {{areas on}} Nauru {{are on the}} narrow coastal belt, where coconut palms flourish. The land {{surrounding}} Buada Lagoon supports bananas, pineapples, vegetables, pandanus trees and indigenous hardwoods such as the tomano tree.|$|E
5|$|Transgenic mice with {{homozygous}} {{depletion of}} NEDD9 are vital and <b>fertile,</b> but have immunological abnormalities {{that result in}} pre-malignant conditions later in life, defects are initially subtle, but increase in later life; B cell homing to the spleen and lymphocyte trafficking are deficient.|$|E
5|$|With {{an area of}} , Shapinsay is {{the eighth}} largest island in the Orkney archipelago. It is low-lying and <b>fertile,</b> {{consequently}} most of the area is given over to farming. Shapinsay has two nature reserves and is notable for its bird life.|$|E
5|$|Within-crop diversity, a {{specific}} crop {{can result from}} various growing conditions, for example a crop growing in nutrient-poor soil {{is likely to have}} stunted growth than a crop growing in more <b>fertile</b> soil. The availability of water, soil pH level, and temperature similarly influence crop growth.|$|E
5|$|York {{lies in the}} Vale of York, a {{flat area}} of <b>fertile</b> arable land bordered by the Pennines, the North York Moors and the Yorkshire Wolds The city was built at the {{confluence}} of the Rivers Ouse and Foss on a terminal moraine left by the last Ice Age.|$|E
5|$|A {{combination}} of favorable geographical features {{contributed to the}} success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich <b>fertile</b> soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{possesses}} definite comparative {{advantages in}} agriculture, {{as the country}} is endowed with {{a vast amount of}} highly <b>fertile</b> land. Between 1860 and 1930, exploitation of the rich land of the pampas strongly pushed economic growth. During the first three decades of the 20th century, Argentina outgrew Canada and Australia in population, total income, and per capita income. By 1913, Argentina was the world's 10th wealthiest nation per capita.|$|E
5|$|Being {{located in}} the Indo-Gangetic Plains of North India, the land is very <b>fertile</b> because low level floods in the Ganges {{continually}} replenish the soil. Varanasi is located between the Ganges confluences with two rivers: the Varuna and the Assi stream. The distance between the two confluences is around , {{and serves as a}} sacred journeying route for Hindus, which culminates with a visit to a Sakshi Vinayak Temple.|$|E
5|$|Below {{the tree}} line there are several zones of climax forest. Birch dominates {{to the west and}} north, Scots Pine with Birch and oak in the eastern Highlands and oak (both Quercus robur and Q. petrea) with Birch in the Central Lowlands and Borders. Much of the Scottish {{coastline}} consists of machair, a <b>fertile</b> dune pasture land formed as sea levels subsided after the last ice age. Machairs have received considerable ecological and conservational attention, chiefly because of their unique ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham's {{early history}} {{is that of}} a remote and {{marginal}} area. The main centres of population, power and wealth in the pre-industrial English Midlands lay in the <b>fertile</b> and accessible river valleys of the Trent, the Severn and the Avon. The area of modern Birmingham lay in between, on the upland Birmingham Plateau and within the densely wooded and sparsely populated Forest of Arden.|$|E
5|$|By 7,000 BC, sowing and {{harvesting}} reached the <b>fertile</b> soil of Mesopotamia, where Sumerians systematized it and scaled it up. By 8,000 BC, farming was entrenched {{on the banks}} of the River Nile. About this time, agriculture was developed independently in the Far East, probably in China, with rice rather than wheat as the primary crop. Maize was domesticated from the wild grass teosinte in West Mexico by 6,700 BC.|$|E
5|$|Chad {{has several}} regions: a desert {{zone in the}} north, an arid Sahelian belt in the centre and a more <b>fertile</b> Sudanian Savanna zone in the south. Lake Chad, after which the country is named, is the largest wetland in Chad and the second-largest in Africa. The capital N'Djamena is the largest city.|$|E
