To achieve this, it is studied on an extrusion profile type which has seam weld and transverse weld regions. Design/methodology/approach: Producing extrusion profile has been performed by a press, which has a capacity of 1460 tones, in a real producing and carried out by changing the exit temperature and ram speed, which are the important parameters. Exit temperature TE, is chosen as 440, 475, 500, 520 and 560 °C. Extrusion speed is also taken {{in the base of}} ram speed VR, and production is carried out at the speeds of 2, 4, 6, 10 and 15 mm/s. Therefore the effects of extrusion parameters on macrostructure properties have been investigated. Findings: It is seen clearly that some differences are occurred from the viewpoint of structural features between the regions, when the experimental results are observed without regarding the extrusion parameters. In addition, it was observed commonly the structure of the material had a change through re-crystallization with increasing temperatures. This situation decreases the significance of seam weld regions. But insignificancy of seam weld region is designed as possible as can be from the viewpoint of decorative. However, when the macro structural figures have been investigated as the ram speed increases more significance on seam welds occurs. Research limitations/implications: Also some macrostructural differences in <b>extrusion</b> <b>welds</b> may occur for between having the other important extrusion parameters such as pressure and extrusion ratio. Therefore, effect of the other parameters can be investigated in future. Practical implications: In application, <b>extrusion</b> <b>welds</b> occur on both solid and hollow profiles.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{aluminium}} extrusion has great {{importance in the}} metal forming industry because {{of its ability to}} produce profiles of various complicated geometries, shapes and sizes. The flow of metal within the extrusion die influences the mechanical properties of extruded products. Metal flow being the core of process, attracts academia and industries to develop better understanding how does metal flow occur during extrusion. <b>Extrusion</b> <b>welding</b> is another prominent topic which has attained attention of industry that is keen to produce hollow profiles with sound extrusion welds. The aim of my research work has been to gain increased understanding about metal flow, <b>extrusion</b> <b>welding</b> and deformation characteristics of aluminium when extruding through a porthole die. I have focused to encircle the topic of flow of metal and to characterize welding conditions during production of aluminium hollow profiles. The art to achieve real metal flow from extrusion process has been developing for some decades. Initially it was the intention to expand the study {{to the end of the}} work by including 3 Dsituations of <b>extrusion</b> <b>welding</b> corresponding to that occurring in industrial extrusion. But as the work proceeded it was realized that the conditions are so complex in <b>extrusion</b> <b>welding,</b> that it was sufficient challenge to map what takes place in the simplified 2 D-extrusion process. A state of the art grid pattern technique has been used to achieve metal flow from extrusion experiments where the conditions are close to perfect 2 D-flow creating an extruded strip with an interior extrusion seam weld. The work comprises of concept development to the final results both for symmetric and non-symmetric metal flow during extrusion. The FE-models have been made to mimic the experimental results and obtain information about different aspects of extrusion process and their influence on metal flow, deformation characteristics and weld formation. The work has substantially increased the knowledge about the non-symmetric flow of metal around the die bridge for hollow profile production. It is found that there is more volume of metal flow and at higher velocity through the bigger porthole of the die. The extrusion weld line is therefore pushed towards the big porthole side at the rear end of the bridge and displaced towards the side of small porthole over the length of extruded profile. It has been shown that by FEA it is straight forward to investigate the local metal flow at the rear end of the bridge where the extrusion weld is created. The analysis shows that a dead (or stagnant) zone of metal will appear at the rear end of the die bridge (where welding occurs) when both pointed and butt-ended rear end of the bridge are used. Because of slow flow velocity in the dead zone, and much increased velocity at the tail end behind it, the material here will become severely stretched. The term stretching zone has therefore been attributed to this region where the material elongates strongly. It is clear that the presence of this stretching zone at this location and the phenomenon of the material becoming heavily stretched contribute to give favourable seam welding conditions here. A comprehensive picture of the topic is made by creating new knowledge both with the help of FEA and experimental results of metal flow. Grid patterns made from contrast pins combined with finite element analysis for study of metal flow of metal forming has proved to be very useful for understanding the complex mechanics of Al extrusion.

Along the mid-axis of the extrusion process the effective strain subjected to the extrusion material can be determined in three different ways. One way is to determine the strains from grid pattern experiments that reveal the real deformations. When it comes to FEA there are two options; the strains can be determined from the initial and final positions of a number of material points distributed along the mid-axis of the material, where after traditional theoretical strain-equations can be used to calculate the effective strain distribution along the axis. Another possibility is to use the post-processor of the software to calculate the strain distribution. In this work the effective strain distribution along the mid-axis of the billet inside the container volume were determined by all these three methods.

40|$|Because {{the cost}} of {{third-party}} construction quality assurance (CQA) of geomembrane liner installations is typically comparable to {{the cost of}} the geomembrane liner, CQA must be optimized to obtain the most benefit for the owner, rate payers, and environment. A regulation-based CQA protocol usually includes testing the material, observing the quality control (QC) program ofthe liner installer, and performing destructive tests on samples of the geomembrane seams. Another well-established type of third-party CQA is leak location surveys using an electrical leak location method. This paper compares representative costs, benefits, and results of the two types of CQA used on geomembrane liners where both types were used. The relative merits of the two types of CQA are discussed. Examples of direct cost benefits are also presented. A large percent of regulation-based CQA is the destructive testing of double wedge welded seams.

The required extrusion load is depending on the process parameters such as the flow stress of the billet material, velocity field, strain rate distribution, and thermal conditions within extrusion.

40|$|The present {{work have}} {{investigated}} variants of an AA 6082 aluminium alloy. Five different alloys with various amounts of Mn, Cr and Zr {{have been subjected}} to three homogenization procedures. After homogenization, the aluminium billets were extruded into plates that were artificially aged to T 6 -temper. Further, the profiles were MIG welded to obtain a heat affected zone. The effect of these parameters on microstructure and mechanical properties of the various alloys in welded state have been studied. The microstructure after <b>extrusion</b> and <b>welding</b> were investigated by optical microscope and hardness measurements. In addition, subsequent heat treatments have been performed in an attempt to further increase the density of dispersoids for one specific alloy. Welding of age-hardened aluminium alloys change the microstructural hardening phase that can be a challenge for the mechanical properties in the heat affected zone (HAZ) and lead to a reduction of the yield strength. The strength of the ageing effect is crucial for the load-bearing capacity of welded structure. The degree of work hardening in the HAZ is important to achieve the same yield strength level as the base material. Introduction of dispersoids in the alloys can affect the microstructure and strength of the aluminium alloys, and in the present work, an attempt to increase the strength by the introduction of dispersoids is carried out. Results from this study show that chemical composition, homogenization procedure, artificial ageing and welding influence the grain structure and mechanical properties of these AA 6082 -alloys.

Finite Element Analyses, however, have been often used for the cost reducing and for a better local investigation of variables like pressure and effective stress inside the welding chamber. In spite of that, up to now, commercial FE codes present a “structural” limit during the welding phase due to the impossibility to simulate element joining when material reaches the required process conditions. From this point of view, the Natural Element Method (NEM) provides significant advantages; in fact, the meshless characteristic of NEM is “natively” able to simulate joining of free surfaces, as it occurs during porthole die <b>extrusion,</b> simulating the <b>welding</b> line formation inside the welding chamber.

40|$|Aluminum is a metal {{widely used}} {{in areas such as}} a {{construction}} material in buildings, transportation,oil and gas industry, in packaging for preserving food and drink, electric cables, heatexchangers and many other areas. The wide area of use is due to aluminum being a relatively lightmetal (1 / 3 of the weight of steel), has relatively high strength, good formability, high corrosionresistance, is a good conductor of heat and electricity, has good reflectivity, and can be recycledover and over again. The latter lowers the CO 2 footprint and the energy consumption substantially. This master?s thesis is very relevant to the oil and gas industry, transportation industry (car,ship, train, etc.) and to other industries involving the use of metal inert gas (MIG) welded aluminum. Welded aluminum profiles of an Al-Mg-Si alloy, AA 6082, is to be characterized in termsof fatigue. Fatigue is the dominant cause of collapse of components in structures that experienceapplied cyclic loads over a certain limit. Fatigue behavior of a structure relies on mechanical design,the actual surrounding environment and the materials microstructure, mechanical strength,intrinsic properties and surface quality. The fatigue behavior will be discussed on the basis ofvariations in the microstructure (morphology and grain structure) of the weld metal, the HAZ andthe base material. Also, the influence of surface quality and the external environment (humidityand temperature) will be investigated. As welding reduces the strength of aluminum, two postweld treatments, PWHT and shot peening, will therefore be investigated to see how they affectthe strengths of welded aluminum. Various techniques and equipment will be used such as fatigueand tensile machines, roughness and surface measuring instruments, hardness tester, optical lightmicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This master?s thesis is part of an international collaboration project between Norway and Qatarwhere the participating industrial partners are Hydro, Qatar Petroleum (QP) and Qatalum (primaryaluminum plant in Qatar where QP and Hydro owns 50 % each). The microstructures were investigated of both the base materials and across the weld. The microstructure of the base material showed the typical fibrous grain structure of the AA 6082 alloyalong with a recrystallized layer along the surfaces from the <b>extrusion.</b> The <b>welded</b> profiles presentedtypical characteristics as recrystallization and nucleation in the weld, grain growth in theheat affected zone (HAZ) and a fusion line. The AA 6082. 52 -T 6, welded fall 2012, revealed a very poor welding. The HAZ went throughoutthe welded profiles. This affected all of the properties of this profile, reducing the yield strengthwith 71 % and the ultimate tensile strength by 50 % compared to the base material. The fatigueresistance was also reduced, by 35 %. The fatigue fractography also revealed large poresdue to entrapped air during welding. Therefore, these results are not representative for weldedAA 6082. 52 -T 6. The AA 6082. 50 base material had lower strengths than AA 6082. 52 due to some differences inthe chemical composition. The AA 6082. 50 -T 6 was welded spring 2013 and showed an improvedwelding. The resulting decrease of yield strength compared to the base material was 40 % andthe ultimate tensile strength by 20 %. The fatigue resistance was decreased by 40 % compared tothe base material. By introducing PWHT, the fatigue resistance increased with 26 % compared tothe as welded. The yield strength increased with 40 % and the ultimate tensile strength with 6 %. Shot peening of the as welded specimens did not increase the strength of the material as muchas the PWHT. The yield strength increased with 10 % and the ultimate tensile strength with 4 %. The fatigue resistance however, increased with 38 % and showed a better fatigue limit than thebase material. The fatigue fractography of AA 6082. 50 -T 6 showed all of the usual characteristics of a fatiguefailure. Some irregularities were found in the shot peened specimens suggesting some hydrogendiffusion had occurred. Some hydrogen diffusion is also suspected in the PWHT specimens.
