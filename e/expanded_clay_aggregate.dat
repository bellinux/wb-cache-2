40|$|An {{aluminium}} scrap recycling waste called non-metal product (NMP) was tested {{as raw material}} for production of <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> <b>aggregates.</b> Processing of NMP created in the {{aluminium scrap}} recycling companies {{is one of the}} most challenging tasks due to its toxic nature - in accordance with the Basel Convention, Annex III, marking of this waste is H 4. 3 (reaction with water results in highly inflammable substances) and H 10 (reaction with water results in increased concentration of toxic gases, for instance, ammonia). The main phases of the starting waste are spinel (FeAl 2 O 4) or (MgAl 2 O 4) and aluminium nitride (AlN). The main task of the present research is to investigate the possibility of non-waste utilization of NMP and reprocessing it into environmental friendly material. The heat treat-ment in the temperature higher than 1100 oC was selected as appropriated method in order to eliminate impurities of NMP, like ammonia and others.

40|$|Abstract—This {{paper is}} {{concerning}} {{the issues of}} behaviour of lightweight <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> <b>aggregates</b> concrete exposed to high temperature. Lightweight <b>aggregates</b> from <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> are produced by firing of row material up to temperature 1050 °C. Lightweight aggregates have suitable properties {{in terms of volume}} stability, when exposed to temperatures up to 1050 °C, which could indicate their suitability for construction applications with higher risk of fire. The test samples were exposed to heat by using the standard temperature-time curve ISO 834. Negative changes in resulting mechanical properties, such as compressive strength, tensile strength, and flexural strength were evaluated. Also visual evaluation of the specimen was performed. On specimen exposed to excessive heat, an explosive spalling could be observed, due to evaporation of considerable amount of unbounded water from the inner structure of the concrete.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{basic information}} on the mechanical properties of steel fibre-reinforced lightweight concrete, manufactured using pumice stone or <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> <b>aggregates.</b> Results are presented for standard compressive tests and indirect tensile tests (splitting tests on cylinder specimens and flexure tests on prismatic beams using a three-point loading arrangement) under monotonically increasing or cyclically varying loads. The influence of steel fibres and aggregate types on modulus of elasticity, compressive and tensile strength and post-peak behaviour is evaluated. Test results show that compressive strength does not change for pumice stone aggregates, while an increase is observed for expanded clay; tensile strength and fracture toughness are significantly improved for both pumice stone and <b>expanded</b> <b>clay.</b> The results also show that with both <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> and pumice stone lightweight aggregates a suitable content of fibres allows one to obtain performances comparable with those expected from normal weight concrete, the important advantage of lower structural weight being maintained...|$|R
