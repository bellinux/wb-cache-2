5|$|Nicholas de Balmyle (d. 1319 × 1320), {{also called}} Nicholas of St Andrews, was a Scottish {{administrator}} and prelate {{in the late}} 13th century and early 14th century. A graduate of an unknown university, he served his earliest years as a clergyman at St Andrews, moving on to hold churches in Lothian as well as <b>deputising</b> (as Official) to two archdeacons of Lothian.|$|E
5|$|As the Afrika Korps {{retreated into}} Libya and Tunisia, the 2nd Division, {{as part of}} X Corps, was in pursuit. A series of engagements with the enemy followed, occupying Kippenberger and his men. After the battle at Takrouna, the 5th Brigade was {{withdrawn}} from the frontlines, having lost 38% of its strength. He remained a highly regarded officer, <b>deputising</b> as commander of the 2nd Division in Freyberg's occasional absence from the field in higher commands.|$|E
5|$|Germany invaded Poland in {{the early}} morning of 1 September 1939. The British Cabinet met late that morning and issued a warning to Germany that unless it withdrew from Polish {{territory}} Britain would carry out its obligations to Poland. When the House of Commons met at 6:00pm, Chamberlain and Labour deputy leader Arthur Greenwood (<b>deputising</b> for the sick Clement Attlee) entered the chamber to loud cheers. Chamberlain spoke emotionally, laying the blame for the conflict on Hitler.|$|E

5|$|Producer Alan Douglas {{had helped}} Duke Ellington with errands {{when they were}} both working in Paris in the early 1960s. Later, after Douglas had joined United Artists and moved to New York, he received, {{according}} to his own account, a surprise visit from Ellington, who suggested recording a piano-based album (Ellington was known as a big band leader). Douglas suggested Charles Mingus as double bassist, who then insisted on having Max Roach as drummer. Mingus had played with Ellington before, <b>deputising</b> for the regular bassist in the leader's orchestra in 1953, but was fired after four days, following a fight with another musician, Juan Tizol.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of printing, written legal texts became more available, reducing the need for students to attend readings and lectures. However, {{this meant that the}} students denied themselves the opportunity to query what they had learnt or discuss it in greater detail. Eventually, students now had a way to learn without attending lectures, they began to excuse themselves from lectures, meetings and moots altogether; in the early 17th century they developed a way of <b>deputising</b> other students to do their moots for them. The Benchers and Readers did little to arrest the decline of the practice of lecturers and readings, first because many probably believed (as the students did) that books were an adequate substitute, and secondly because many were keen to avoid the work of preparing a reading, which cut into their time as practising barristers. These problems were endemic to all the Inns, not just Gray's Inn.|$|E
5|$|Bell was {{selected}} {{to play in the}} opening match of the 1904–05 season, a 1–4 home defeat to West Bromwich Albion. Bell kept his place in the side for the following match against Chesterfield, but was dropped for the trip to Bolton Wanderers in favour of youngster William Hutchinson, a summer signing from non-League club Alston. He was recalled for the visit of Liverpool on 22 October 1904, <b>deputising</b> for the unavailable Doug MacFarlane, but then spent more than two months out of the team. Bell made two further appearances for Burnley that season, playing in consecutive defeats to Bolton Wanderers and Blackpool in January 1905. He found himself more involved in the first-team during the 1905–06 campaign, making 19 league appearances. On 13 January 1906, he played in the first FA Cup game of his career as Burnley were eliminated by Southern League side Tottenham Hotspur in the first round. Bell scored his first goal of the season on 10 February 1906, netting the opening goal in the 2–2 draw against Burslem Port Vale. During March 1906, he scored in the home wins over Leeds City and Chelsea.|$|E

5|$|In the 2008–09 season, Buffon {{was once}} again sidelined by several injuries. From September through January, reserve goalkeeper Alexander Manninger held his {{position}} between the sticks, gaining praise for his <b>deputising.</b> Due to recurring injuries, Manninger's performances and Juventus's poor form {{towards the end of}} the season (as Buffon was seen despondent whilst the team drew with both Lecce and Atalanta), there were further rumours that Buffon was displeased and wanted to part ways with the club. He admitted he was disappointed with the current results, but assured that he had no intention of leaving. After a discussion with management, he said he was reassured about the club's future and signed a contract extension to 2013. Buffon and Juventus finished the season on a high note, with two victories, finishing in second place behind Internazionale. They were knocked out of the Coppa Italia semi-finals by eventual champions Lazio and of the Champions League in the round of 16 by Chelsea. Buffon was nominated for the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2009 for the sixth consecutive season since first being nominated in 2004. Buffon made his 300th appearance for Juventus in a 3–3 home draw against Chievo in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Robert was Lord Chancellor {{from spring}} 1140 to summer 1154, serving King Stephen of England. It {{is not known}} exactly when Stephen {{appointed}} Robert chancellor nor why Stephen choose him for the office. The historian Richard Sherman speculated that Stephen appointed Robert as a favour to Walter de Gant, perhaps because of Walter's presence at the Battle of Cowton Moor in 1138. Three charters which date from March 1140 to January 1141 and {{are supposed to be}} witnessed by Robert all have difficulties with either the dating or whether the signature attributed to Robert is actually Robert, so exact dating of his term of office isn't possible from charter evidence. For a brief period in 1141, Stephen's rival Empress Matilda also appointed two chancellors– William de Vere and William fitzGilbert– but they did not interrupt Robert's term of service. Robert was with Stephen at Caistor during the middle of 1143, where he was a witness on charters. Throughout his approximately 14 years as chancellor, Robert only witnessed 20 charters certainly and perhaps another 13 that are not securely attributed to Robert. Stephen's two previous chancellors, Roger le Poer and Philip de Harcourt, had a much higher rate of attesting charters– 62 in 3.5 years for Roger and 12 in 9 months for Philip. Even Baldric, Robert's subordinate and holder of the office of keeper of the royal seal, attested 17 charters during Stephen's reign. Various reasons have been put forward for why Robert attested at a lower rate than the earlier chancellors, including indifference to his office, <b>deputising</b> the duties to another clerk, or difficulty in following the itinerant court due to age. Robert's last secure appearance as chancellor as a witness to a charter is one dated to the summer of 1154 at Lincoln.|$|E

25|$|By 1931, as {{the economy}} headed towards crisis, both in Britain and around the world, {{with the onset of}} the Great Depression, Baldwin and the Conservatives entered into a {{coalition}} with Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. This decision led to MacDonald's expulsion from his own party, and Baldwin, as Lord President of the Council, became de facto Prime Minister, <b>deputising</b> for the increasingly senile MacDonald, until he once again officially became Prime Minister in 1935.|$|E
