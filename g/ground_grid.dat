Different shapes of <b>grounding</b> <b>grids</b> have also been considered in [4] in calculating ground resistance using the finite-element method (FEM). A substation <b>grounding</b> <b>grid</b> has been analyzed with the variation of soil layer depth in [5]. Ref. [6] conducted a study where they measured the impedances of four <b>grounding</b> <b>grids</b> using tuned-frequency test equipment operating close to the system operating frequency. FEM was used in [7] for computing the <b>grounding</b> <b>grid</b> resistance. A scheme was proposed in [8] for calculating the ground resistance using FEM to the resolution of solid models in 3 D view. As discussed in many literatures including [3, 4, 7], although FEMs are the most accurate methods for computing <b>grounding</b> <b>grid</b> resistance, these methods are quiet complicated and time consuming for grounding system design purpose. In [9], it is shown that the low or high resistivity soil layer formed in raining or freezing season affects the safety of grounding system, and leads to the changes of grounding resistance of the grounding system, step and touch voltages on the ground surface. A practical example of ground resistance measurement has been presented in a 154  kV substation under commercial operating condition [10]. In [11], a research study has been carried out to show the validity of the formula available in the literature against the measured earth resistance values at the field site. Ref. [12] has evaluated the role played by the foundations in a substation yard as grounding element and estimated the magnitude of the fault and leakage currents carried by the foundations. An artificial intelligent network approach is used for developing the relationship between the ground resistance and the vertically inserted electrode in the soil in [13]. Dimensional and grid electrodes are used for the measurement of ground resistance near a residential area in [14]. A methodological approach has developed for estimating the ground resistance of the several grounding system with various ground enhancing compounds using ANN [15]. Ref. [16] has measured soil resistivity and grounding resistance at the four selected sites of the Lambak Kanan residential area of Brunei Darussalam and compared with simulation results. However, the main drawback is the smaller number of measurement sites. A linear three-pole wiring method has proposed to measure the grounding resistance of buildings structure in water through variance analysis and correlation coefficient analysis methods, and solves the problem about how to measure the grounding resistance of buildings structure in water [17]. AC, DC and impulse tests have performed on rod and grid electrodes and the measured quantities are compared with computed values obtained from numerical models. Measured ground resistance and impedance at low frequency showed reasonable agreement with simple standard formulae and computational models, but revealed a significant falloff with current magnitude in the range often used for the practical testing of the high-voltage grounding systems [18].|$|R
