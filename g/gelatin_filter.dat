50|$|Filter mounting: This mount is {{used for}} {{attaching}} filters to EF lenses. There are three types: front threaded mount, inner drop-in mount, and rear gelatin holders. Front threaded filters are used on most lenses, and are attached by threading and tightening the filter. Inner, drop-in filter mounts are used on super telephoto EF lenses. They are attached by first pressing the two buttons on the filter mount, and pulling it out. Then either a round threaded filter is attached, or one can use a <b>gelatin</b> <b>filter.</b> Rear <b>gelatin</b> <b>filter</b> holders are used by cutting out a sheet of gelatin, to the size shown {{on the back of}} the lens and then sliding it into the holder. Filter mounts are useful for all types of photography, and every EF lens has either one or two of the three types used.|$|E
50|$|Wide angle L-lenses {{typically}} have a <b>gelatin</b> <b>filter</b> holder on the mounting {{point of the}} lens, which allows the photographer to cut a small, square piece of gelatin out of a larger filter sheet {{and place it on}} the lens. On film cameras, these are typically used to correct the color temperature, but on digital cameras this is largely unnecessary, as the color temperature can be corrected in software. The mount is still commonly used for neutral density gelatin sheets though, especially on certain wide-angle lenses where the protruding front element precludes the use of any screw-in filters. Some telephoto L-lenses, such as the EF 70-200mm zoom lenses, or the EF 300mm f/4L IS USM do not have rear <b>gelatin</b> <b>filter</b> holders. Super-telephoto lenses such as the EF 500mm f/4L IS USM, or the EF 200mm f/2L IS USM do have a rear 52mm drop-in filter holder which can be used to hold gelatin type filters.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the physical collection efficiency of commercially available filters for collecting airborne bacteria, viruses, and other particles in the 10 – 900 nm (nanometer) size range. Laboratory experiments with various polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polycarbonate (PC) and <b>gelatin</b> <b>filters</b> in conjunction with ButtonTM Inhalable samplers and three-piece cassettes were undertaken. Both biological and non-biological test aerosols were used: Bacillus atrophaeus, MS 2, polystyrene latex (PSL), and sodium chloride (NaCl). The B. atrophaeus endospores had an aerodynamic diameter of 900 nm, whereas MS 2 virion par-ticles ranged from 10 to 80 nm. Monodisperse 350 nm PSL particles were used as this size was believed to have the lowest filtration efficiency. NaCl solution (1 % weight by volume) was used to create a polydisperse aerosol in the 10 – 600 nm range. The physical collection efficiency was determined by measuring particle concentrations size-selectively upstream and downstream of the filters. The PTFE and <b>gelatin</b> <b>filters</b> showed excellent collection efficiency (> 93 %) for all of the test particles. The PC filters showed lower collection efficiency for small particles especially < 100 nm. Among the tested filters, the lowest collection efficiencies, 49 and 22 %, were observed for 1 and 3 -mmpore size PC filters at the particle sizes of 47 and 63 nm, respectively. The result...|$|R

Materials and methods: Bacterial aerosols were collected with <b>gelatin</b> <b>filters,</b> in a single-chair clinic during ultrasonic scaling treatments on two patients with periodontitis. Results: The results showed that bacterial aerosols contamination could spread a horizontal distance of 100 cm and a vertical distance of 50 cm from a patient’s oral cavity, and remain airborne suspended for 20 minutes. Conclusion: Proper environmental and personal infection control measures, including isolation, ventilation, and full-cover facial shield, are recommended to diminish the contaminating risk in dental clinics...|$|R
40|$|An {{inhalation}} exposure {{system was}} characterized to deliver aerosolized monkeypox virus (MPXV), and a nonhuman primate (NHP) inhalation monkeypox model {{was developed in}} cynomologus macaques. A head-only aerosol exposure system was characterized, and two sampling methods were evaluated: liquid impingement via an impinger and impaction via a <b>gelatin</b> <b>filter.</b> The aerosol concentrations obtained with the <b>gelatin</b> <b>filter</b> and impinger were virtually identical, indicating that either method is acceptable for sampling aerosols containing MPXV. The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) was for individual aerosol tests in the aerosol system characterization and the NHP study ranged from 1. 08 to 1. 15 &# 181;m, indicating that the aerosol particles were of a sufficient size to reach the alveoli. Six cynomolgus macaques (four male and two female) were used on study. The animals were aerosol exposed with MPXV and received doses between 2. 51 x 104 to 9. 28 x 105 plaque forming units (pfu) inhaled. Four of the six animals died or were euthanized due to their moribund conditions. Both animals that received the lowest exposure doses survived {{to the end of}} the observation period. The inhalation LD 50 was determined to be approximately 7. 8 x 104 pfu inhaled. These data demonstrate that an inhalation MPXV infection model has been developed in the cynomolgus macaque with disease course and lethal dose similar to previously published data...|$|E

Scattered or reflected stray light caused large errors in spectrofluorometer analysis or natural sample surfaces. Most spurious light components can be eliminated by recording successive fluorescence spectra for each sample, using identical instrument settings, first with an appropriate glass or <b>gelatin</b> <b>filter</b> on the excitation side of the sample, and subsequently with the same filter on the emission side of the sample. This technique appears more accurate than any alternative technique for testing the fluorescence of natural surfaces...|$|E

50|$|Wratten is also {{credited}} with introducing the noodling process for pre-washed gelatin emulsion in 1878, which substantially increases {{the surface area}} of the emulsion and thus {{the efficiency of the}} process. This allowed creating more sensitive photographic plates than previously possible. In 1906 Wratten incorporated his company with his son, S. H. Wratten, and C. E. Kenneth Mees as owners. Mees, a recent graduate of London University, was placed in charge of new product development, and soon introduced panchromatic plates sensitive to longer wavelengths. To allow photography using particular wavelengths of light, Mees developed dyed <b>gelatin</b> <b>filters</b> which were placed between the plate or lens and the subject matter. These colored filters, later known as Wratten filters, began with yellow filters dyed with tartrazine (CAS # 1934-21-0), but were soon available in many more colors. George Eastman purchased Wratten and Wainwright in 1912, to be merged with Kodak Ltd.. Frederick and S. H. Wratten continued working at Kodak's branch in Harrow, while Mees moved to Rochester, New York to found Eastman Kodak's Research Laboratories.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIt was {{previously}} demonstrated that microbial communities of pig manure were composed of both bacteria and archaea. Recent {{studies have shown}} that bacteria are aerosolized from pig manure, but none have ever focused on the airborne archaeal burden. We sought here to develop and apply molecular ecology approaches to thoroughly characterize airborne archaea from swine confinement buildings (SCBs). Eight swine operations were visited, twice in winter and once during summer. Institute of Occupational Medicine cassettes loaded with 25 -mm <b>gelatin</b> <b>filters</b> were used to capture the inhalable microbial biomass. The total genomic DNA was extracted and used as a template for PCR amplification of the archaeal 16 S rRNA gene. High concentrations of archaea were found in SCB bioaerosols, being as high as 10 (8) 16 S rRNA gene copies per cubic meter of air. Construction and sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene libraries revealed that all sequences were closely related to methanogenic archaea, such as Methanosphaera stadtmanae (94. 7 % of the archaeal biodiversity). Archaeal community profiles were compared by 16 S rRNA gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. This analysis showed similar fingerprints in each SCB and confirmed the predominance of methanogenic archaea in the bioaerosols. This study sheds new light on the nature of bioaerosols in SCBs and suggests that archaea are also aerosolized from pig manure...|$|R

40|$|An {{integrated}} approach for {{the characterization of}} bioaerosol was employed in different sites (that include hypogeal and semi-confined areas), characterized by great cultural/artistic interest besides peculiar architectural structures, thermo- hygrometric and lighting parameters. These typologies of indoor environments preserve several artworks like mural paintings, stone-works, paper or parchments that are susceptible of microbial colonization. The presence of fungal spores and low air change can induce both potentially effects to human health (users/operators) or biodegradation of historical-artistic manufacts.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to quantify the recovery efficiency of culturable B. thailandensis from several common aerosol sampling devices to ensure that collected microorganisms could be reliably recovered post-collection. The sampling devices tested included 25 -mm <b>gelatin</b> <b>filters,</b> 25 -mm stainless steel disks used in Mercer cascade impactors, and two types of glass impingers. The results demonstrate that while several processing methods tested resulted in significantly lower physical recovery efficiencies than other methods, it was possible to obtain culturable recovery efficiencies for B. thailandensis and physical recovery efficiencies for 1 μm fluorescent spheres of at least 0. 95 from all of the sampling media tested given an appropriate sample processing procedure. The results of the present study also demonstrated that the bubbling action of liquid media in all-glass impingers (AGIs) can result in physical loss of material from the collection medium, although additional studies are needed to verify the exact mechanisms involved. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that the collection mechanism as well as the post-collection processing method can significantly affect the recovery from and retention of culturable microorganisms in sampling media, potentially affecting the calculated airborne concentration and any subsequent estimations of risk or dose derived from such data...|$|R
40|$|Using uranine as a {{physical}} tracer, this study assessed the sampling efficiencies of four bioaerosol samplers (Andersen 6 -stage impactor, all glass impinger “AGI- 30,” OMNI- 3000, and Airport MD 8 with <b>gelatin</b> <b>filter)</b> for collecting Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Campylobacter jejuni), and bacteria without cell wall (Mycoplasma synoviae) which were aerosolized in a HEPA isolator. In addition, the half-life times of these bacteria in aerosols were estimated. The uranine concentrations collected by the samplers were used for calculating the physical efficiencies, and the bacteria/uranine ratios were used for calculating the biological efficiencies. The results show the Airport MD 8 had the highest physical efficiency. Compared with the Airport MD 8, the physical efficiencies of the AGI- 30 and the OMNI- 3000 were 74 % and 49 %, respectively. A low physical efficiency of the Andersen impactor (18 %) was obtained, but it was mainly caused by the incomplete recovery of uranine when handling the air samples, so could not be ascribed to the sampler efficiency. Both the Andersen impactor and the AGI- 30 showed high biological efficiencies for all four bacterial species. The biological efficiencies of the OMNI- 3000 for C. jejuni (1 %) and of the Airport MD 8 for E. coli (38 %) and C. jejuni (2 %) were significantly lower than 100 %, indicating that their sampling stresses inactivated the bacterial culturability. The half-life times at 21 - 23 °C temperature and 80 - 85 % relative humidity were 43. 3 min for E. faecalis, 26. 7 min for M. synoviae, 21. 2 min for E. coli, and 4. 0 min for C. jejuni in the air...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The {{airborne}} {{transmission of}} infectious diseases in livestock production is increasingly receiving research attention. Reliable techniques of air sampling are crucial to underpin the findings of such studies. This study evaluated the physical and biological efficiencies and detection limits of four samplers (Andersen 6 -stage impactor, all-glass impinger "AGI- 30 ", OMNI- 3000 and MD 8 with <b>gelatin</b> <b>filter)</b> for collecting aerosols of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Materials and Method. IBDV aerosols mixed with a physical tracer (uranine) were generated in an isolator, and then collected by the bioaerosol samplers. Samplers' physical and biological efficiencies were derived based on the tracer concentration and the virus/tracer ratio, respectively. Detection limits for the samplers were estimated with the obtained efficiency data. Results. Physical efficiencies of the AGI- 30 (96 %) and the MD 8 (100 %) {{were significantly higher than}} that of the OMNI- 3000 (60 %). Biological efficiency of the OMNI- 3000 (23 %) was significantly lower than 100 % (P < 0. 01), indicating inactivation of airborne virus during sampling. The AGI- 30, the Andersen impactor and the MD 8 did not significantly inactivate virus during sampling. The 2 -min detection limits of the samplers on airborne IBDV were 4. 1 log(10) 50 % egg infective dose (EID 50) m(- 3) for the Andersen impactor, 3. 3 log(10) EID 50 m(- 3) for the AGI- 30, 2. 5 log(10) EID 50 m(- 3) for the OMNI- 3000, and 2. 9 log(10) EID 50 m(- 3) for the MD 8. The mean half-life of IBDV aerosolized at 20 degrees C and 70 % was 11. 9 min. Conclusion. Efficiencies of different samplers vary. Despite its relatively low sampling efficiency, the OMNI- 3000 is suitable for use in environments with low viral concentrations because its high flow rate gives a low detection limit. With the 4 samplers investigated, negative air samples cannot guarantee virus-free aerial environments, which means that transmission of infectious agents between farms may still occur even when no virus has been detected...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficiencies and suitability of samplers for airborne microorganisms and dust, which could be used in practical livestock houses. Two studies were performed: 1) Testing impaction and cyclone pre-separators for dust sampling in livestock houses; 2) Determining sampling efficiencies of four bioaerosol samplers for bacteria and virus. Study 1. The overloading problem of the EU reference impaction pre-separator (IPS) was tested in layer houses and compared with cyclone pre-separators (CPS) for sampling PM 10 and PM 2. 5. Study 2. Physical and biological efficiencies of Andersen 6 -stage impactor, all glass impinger (AGI- 30), high air flow rate sampler OMNI- 3000, and MD 8 with <b>gelatin</b> <b>filter</b> were investigated for collecting aerosolized bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni and Mycoplasma synoviae and live Gumboro vaccine virus. A tracer (uranine) was used to determine physical efficiencies and bioaerosol deposition. The study was done in a HEPA isolator (volume: 1. 3 m 3). The results show the PM 10 IPS did not become overloaded in 24 h measurements in layer houses, whereas PM 2. 5 IPS became overloaded within 1 h. CPS did not become overloaded during 48 h sampling of both dust fractions. The OMNI- 3000 (62 %) had lower physical efficiency than the MD 8, while the other samplers had similar efficiencies as MD 8. All the bioaerosol samplers had high biological efficiencies for all four bacterial species, except for C. jejuni (1 %) when measured with the OMNI- 3000 and for E. coli (38 %) and C. jejuni (2 %) when measured with the MD 8. The biological efficiencies of the Andersen impactor (61 %), the AGI- 30 (90 %) and the MD 8 (163 %) were not significantly different from 100 % for collecting the aerosolized virus.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the distribution patterns and exposure concentrations of bioaerosols in industries suspected to have high levels of bioaerosol exposure. Methods: We selected 11 plants including 3 livestock feed plants (LF industry), 3 metal working fluids handling plants (MWFs industry), and 5 sawmills and measured total airborne bacteria, fungi, endotoxins, as well as dust. Airborne bacteria and fungi were measured with one stage impactor, six stage cascade impactor, and <b>gelatin</b> <b>filters.</b> Endotoxins were measured with polycarbonate filters. Results: The geometric means (GM) of the airborne concentrations of bacteria, fungi, and endotoxins were 1, 864, 2, 252  CFU/m 3, and 31. 5 EU/m 3, respectively at the sawmills, followed by the LF industry (535, 585  CFU/m 3, and 22. 0 EU/m 3) and MWFs industry (258, 331  CFU/m 3, and 8. 7 EU/m 3). These concentrations by industry type were significantly statistically different (p < 0. 01). The ratio of indoor to outdoor concentration was 6. 2, 1. 9, 3. 2, and 3. 2 for bacteria, fungi, endotoxins, and dust in the LF industry, 5. 0, 0. 9, 2. 3, and 12. 5 in the MWFs industry, and 3. 7, 4. 1, 3. 3, and 9. 7 in sawmills. The respiratory fractions of bioaerosols were differentiated by bioaerosol types and industry types: the respiratory fraction of bacteria in the LF industry, MWF industry, and sawmills was 59. 4 %, 72. 0 %, and 57. 7 %, respectively, and that of fungi was 77. 3 %, 89. 5 %, and 83. 7 % in the same order. Conclusion: We found that bioaerosol concentration was the highest in sawmills, followed by LF industry facilities and MWFs industry facilities. The indoor/outdoor ratio of microorganisms was larger than 1 and respiratory fraction of microorganisms was more than 50 % of the total microorganism concentrations which might penetrate respiratory tract easily.

40|$|Background: Regular {{inspection}} of the cleanliness of the ventilation systems, {{as well as their}} periodic cleaning and disinfection, if necessary, are the main factors of the proper maintenance of each system. Performing maintenance operations on the ventilation system, workers are exposed to risk associated with the exposure to harmful biological agents. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the employees' exposure to bioaerosols during maintenance work on ventilation systems. Material and Methods: Bioaerosol measurements were carried out using a button sampler. The microbial particles were collected on <b>gelatin</b> <b>filters.</b> Settled-dust samples from the inner surface of the air ducts and filter-mat samples were selected for the microbiological analysis. In the collected air, dust and filter samples the concentration of bacteria and fungi were determined. Results: Bacteria and fungi concentrations ranged between 3. 6 × 102 - 2. 2 × 104 CFU/m 3 and 4. 7 × 102 - 4. 5 × 103 CFU/m 3 at workplaces where the operations connected with mechanical ventilation cleaning were performed and 2. 2 × 104 - 1. 2 × 105 CFU/m 3 and 9. 8 × 101 - 2. 5 × 102 CFU/m 3 at workplaces where filter exchange was performed, respectively. The qualitative analysis of microorganisms isolated from the air in all studied workplaces revealed that the most prevalent bacteria belonged to Bacillus genus. The average concentrations of bacteria and fungi in filter-mat samples were 3. 3 × 103 CFU/cm 2 and 1. 4 × 104 CFU/cm 2, respectively. In settled-dust samples, average concentrations were 591 CFU/ 100 cm 2 and 52 CFU/ 100 cm 2, for bacteria and fungi respectively. Conclusions: Workers cleaning ventilation systems are exposed to harmful biological agents classified into risk groups, 1 and 2, according to their level of the risk of infection. The research conducted in the workplace can be the basis of risk assessment related to exposure to harmful biological agents during maintenance work in ventilation.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{fluorescence}} of tubercle bacilli {{stained with}} auramine and rhoda-mine {{does not require}} ultra-violet light. It {{can be caused by}} blue light up to 406 mp. A’copper sdphate ammonia liquid filter, suitably diluted, will transmit this wave-band. A <b>gelatin</b> screen <b>filter,</b> absorbing all light below 510 mp. is used in the eyepiece. Normal, high intensity projection Alament lamps, combined with lamp condensers of large aperture, provide suitable light sources. The numerical aperture of the microsoope condenser must be fully used by immersion in glycerol. The fluorescence is vellry bright with the usual biological, and certain binocular, microscopes. The simplicity of the equipment enables fluorescence microscopy of tubercle bacilli to be used at low cost in any laboratory. The phenomenon of fluorescence as applied to stained bacilli may be described as follows. Certain fluorochroms (e. g. auramine) absorb light of a certain wave-length, and convert it into light energy of another wave-length. This effect is observed by illuminating the specimen with suitable light passed through a filter which transmits a wave-band capable of causing fluorescence, and b...|$|R

40|$|Coughing {{plays an}} {{important}} role in influenza transmission; however, there is insufficient information regarding the viral load in cough because of the lack of convenient and reliable collection methods. We developed a portable airborne particlecollection system to measure the viral load; it is equipped with an air sampler to draw air and pass it through a <b>gelatin</b> membrane <b>filter</b> connected to a cone-shaped, megaphone-like device to guide the cough airflow to the membrane. The membrane was dissolved in a medium, and the viral load was measured using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction and a plaque assay. The approximate viral recovery rate of this system was 10 % in simulation experiments to collect and quantify the viral particles aerosolized by a nebulizer. Using this system, cough samples were collected from 56 influenza A patients. The total viral detection rate was 41 % (23 / 56), and the viral loads varied significantly (from < 10, less than the detection limit, to 2240 viral gene copies/cough). Viable viruses were detected from 3 samples with ≤ 18 plaque forming units per cough sample. The virus detection rates were similar among different groups of patients infected with different viral subtypes and during different influenza seasons. Among patients who did not receive antiviral treatment, viruses were detected in one of six cases in the vaccinated group and four of six cases in the unvaccinated group. We found cases with high viral titers in throat swabs or oral secretions but very low or undetectable in coughs and vice versa suggesting other possible anatomical sites where the viruses might be mixed into the cough. Our system is easy to operate, appropriate for bedside use, and is useful for comparing the viral load in cough samples from influenza patients under various conditions and settings. However, further large-scale studies are warranted to validate our results. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 729 号 学位授与年月日:平成 26 年 12 月 3 日Author: Etsuko Hatagishi, Michiko Okamoto, Suguru Ohmiya, Hisakazu Yano, Toru Hori, Wakana Saito, Hiroshi Miki, Yasushi Suzuki, Reiko Saito, Taro Yamamoto, Makoto Shoji, Yoshihisa Morisaki, Soichiro Sakata, Hidekazu NishimuraCitation: PLoS ONE, 9 (8), e 103560; 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to design biodegradable nanospheres of cationized gelatin as a carrier of cellular internalization of plasmid DNA. Ethylenediamine was chemically introduced into the carboxyl groups of gelatin to obtain cationized gelatin. The <b>gelatin</b> solution was <b>filtered</b> through a glass membrane under high pressure and dropped into 2 -butanol, acetone or a mixture of the two to form nanospheres of cationized gelatin. The microspheres of cationized gelatin were prepared by the conventional water-in-oil emulsion method. The resulting nano- and microspheres of cationized gelatin were dehydrothermally treated at 160 °C for different time periods to allow them to cross-link chemically. The size of nanospheres, prepared by the filtration method and changed by the type of solvents, was 1. 86, 0. 83 or 0. 24 μm. The in vitro degradation of spheres became faster as the time period of dehydrothermal treatment was shorter. The degradation time of spheres in HCl solution linearly increased with an increase in the cross-linking time, irrespective of the sphere size. However, in the collagenase solution, when compared at the similar cross-linking density, the smaller spheres were degraded more slowly than the larger ones. The plasmid DNA incorporated in the nanospheres was released from the nanospheres with their degradation. The nanospheres incorporating plasmid DNA were internalized into cells, and intracellularly degraded with time to release plasmid DNA. The time period of plasmid DNA release was prolonged by increasing the nanosphere degradation time...|$|R
40|$|Green {{fluorescent}} protein (GFP) visually {{shows the}} expression of proteins by fluorescing when exposed to certain wavelengths of light. The GFP in this experiment was used to identify cells actively releasing viruses. The experiment focused {{on the effect of}} microgravity on the GFP expression of Akata B-cells infected with Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). Two flasks were prepared with 30 million cells each and two bioreactors were prepared with 50 million cells each. All four cultures were incubated for 16 days and fed every four days. Cellometer readings were taken on the feeding days to find cell size, viability, and GFP expression. In addition, the cells were treated with Propodium monoazide (PMA) and run through real time PCR to determine viral load on the feeding days. On the International Space Station air samples are taken to analyze the bacterial and fungal organisms in the air. The Sartorius Portable Airport is being investigated for potential use on the ISS to analyze for viral content in the air. Multiple samples were taken around Johnson Space Center building 37 and in Clear Lake Pediatric Clinic. The filter used was the <b>gelatin</b> membrane <b>filter</b> and the DNA was extracted directly from the filter. The DNA was then run through real time PCR for Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) and EBV as well as GAPDH to test for the presence of DNA. The results so far have shown low DNA yield and no positive results for VZV or EBV. Further inquiry involves accurately replicating an atmosphere with high viral load from saliva as would be found on the ISS to run the air sampler in. Another line of research is stress hormones that may be correlated to the reactivation of latent viruses. The stress hormones from saliva samples are analyzed rather than blood samples. The quantity found in saliva shows the quantity of the hormones actually attached to cells and causing a reaction, whereas in the blood the quantity of hormones is the total amount released to cause a reaction. The particular hormones tested for were cortisol, alpha-amylase, and DHEA. The DHEA was very high in the two control samples tested. Regularly, samples came into the lab from local clinics to be tested for various viruses. Saliva, blood, body scrapes, and tears were received from the clinics and then run for VZV, EBV, and Human Simplex Virus 1 (HSV- 1) with the results then reported back to the clinician. Blood, saliva, and urine from astronauts were also tested for viruses and logged. In addition, several cell cultures were brought up and grown, including adherent Human Lung Fibroblast (HFL) cells infected with VZV, and Akata B-cells infected with EBV...|$|R
