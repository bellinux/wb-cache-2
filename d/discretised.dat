25|$|In any <b>discretised</b> wavelet transform, {{there are}} only a finite number of wavelet {{coefficients}} for each bounded rectangular region in the upper halfplane. Still, each coefficient requires the evaluation of an integral. In special situations this numerical complexity can be avoided if the scaled and shifted wavelets form a multiresolution analysis. This means that there has to exist an auxiliary function, the father wavelet φ in L2(R), and that a is an integer. A typical choice is a = 2 and b = 1. The most famous pair of father and mother wavelets is the Daubechies 4-tap wavelet. Note that not every orthonormal discrete wavelet basis can be associated to a multiresolution analysis; for example, the Journe wavelet admits no multiresolution analysis.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{focuses on}} the incompleteness arising from model misspecification combined with trading restrictions. While asset price dynamics {{are assumed to be}} continuous time processes, the hedging of contingent claims occurs in discrete time. The trading strategies under consideration are understood to be self-financing with respect to an assumed model which may deviate from the ``true'' model, thus associating duplication costs with respect to a contingent claim to be hedged. Based on the robustness result of Gaussian hedging strategies, saying that a superhedge is achieved for convex payoff-functions if the ``true'' asset price volatility is dominated by the assumed one, the error of time <b>discretising</b> these strategies is analysed. It turns out that the time discretisation of Gaussian hedges gives rise to a duplication bias caused by asset price trends, which can be avoided by <b>discretising</b> the hedging model instead of <b>discretising</b> the hedging strategies. Additionally it is shown, that on the one hand binomial strategies incorporate similar robustness features as Gaussian hedges. On the other hand, the distribution of the cost process associated with the binomial hedge coincides with the distribution of the cost process associated with the Gaussian hedge in the limit. Together, the last results yield a strong argument in favour of <b>discretising</b> the hedge model instead of time <b>discretising</b> the strategies...|$|R

50|$|As a scientist, Southwell {{developed}} relaxation {{methods for}} solving partial differential equations in engineering and theoretical physics during the 1930 and the 1940s.

40|$|In the literature, two {{different}} {{models have been}} used to compute link travel times in dynamic traffic assignment (DTA), and elsewhere we investigated how these are affected by <b>discretising</b> the link length. Here we consider <b>discretising</b> time as well as space (the link length). We vary the <b>discretising</b> of time with spatial discretisation held fixed, and vice versa, and also vary both together. The results show that “coordinated ” discretisation is usually the most efficient in approximating the limit solution (continuous time, continuous space) and, even when it is not the most efficient, it has other advantages. The results have implications for algorithms for DTA and for the choice of discrete versus continuous time models. For example, refining the discretisation of time (without refining it for space) can make the solution less accurate, so that in the widely used whole-link models (i. e. without spatial discretisation) it is more efficient to use the largest feasible time steps, close to the link travel time...|$|R
