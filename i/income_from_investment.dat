Uncertainty about labor income arises endogenously, because labor supply evolves randomly over time in response to changes in nancial wealth. We derive {{closed-form solution}}s for optimal consumption, labor supply and investment strategy. We also obtain approximately log-linear relationships between optimal consumption, labor supply and retirement age, respectively. Moreover, we derive Euler equation under uncertainty of asset returns and derive a similar growth equation for expected optimal labor supply.

The types of Pension Fund investment allowed, are term deposit, deposit certificates, stocks, bonds, other marketable securities, direct placement, promissory notes, lands and buildings, fund guards share units and Bank Indonesia certificates.

40|$|Pension Fund {{is a type}} {{of mutual}} fund which works {{involving}} a number of parties and requiring the observance of a number of conditions. The thesis deals with analysis of pension fund investment portfolio, with a view to getting a picture on the investment performance of a pension fund, in these respects, Dana Pensiun BRI, and making evaluation thereof compared with the target set by the management. This thesis also presents the management with alternatives on the formation of the investment portfolio that will ensure optimum return on investment. The investments covered by the analysis include deposit, stock exchange shares, bonds, mutual funds, promissory notes, taking a stake, debenture and property assets. The data used are based on the investment report of 1999 - 2002 periods. To measure the return and investment risks, the analysis uses return and deviation standard. The combinations of portfolio that assure optimum return are determined using correlation and regression analysis to identify which fields of investment contribute to increase in the total income. The results of the analysis show that the return on investment in the 1999 - 2002 period exceeds the target, but the period of 2000 and 2001 shows the reverse conditions. These were all attributable to the external factors that contributed to the investment climate. At the same time, the analysis shows that the fields of investment that contribute to increase in <b>income</b> <b>from</b> <b>investment</b> are deposits, bonds, and taking a stake.

30|$|Take {{the rooftop}} {{photovoltaic}} {{power generation system}} for example. The system has a long working life with zero fuel cost and negligible maintenance cost but requires huge initial investment. Hence its cost depends on {{the capacity of the}} system, the unit-price of the equipment, and the expense of installation and construction. The capacity of the system is related to the overall investment, and it is bound up with the roof of the user and the previous budget. The general capacity of a rooftop photovoltaic power generation system is mainly 3 â€“ 5 kW, which makes, by our informal count, the total investment 4377 â€“ 7295 dollars. According to our investigation, there are three main parts of the <b>income</b> <b>from</b> <b>investment</b> in the rooftop photovoltaic power generation system for a private investor. The first part is the income through the state subsidies. The state subsidy for distributed photovoltaic power stations is 6.13 cents per kWh (including tax) with a subsidy period of 20 years. The second part is the savings from self-produced electricity. The self-produced solar photovoltaic power, whether it is for satisfying self-consumption or for selling to others, is able to be applied to saving money by reducing electricity bills. In other words, the system operates itself just like a virtual power plant. The third part is the sales earnings in commercial transactions. The private investors can receive proceeds from the sale of electricity by selling the distributed solar photovoltaic power to the power grid corporation at the benchmarking of electricity price of the desulfurization coal-fired units. If one private investor is willing to build such a system of 5 kW installed capacity with an investment of roughly $ 7300, he/she is more than capable of recovering costs in about 6 â€“ 7 years and getting nearly 15 % yield in the next 13 years in China. The basic data is business information which is not convenient to publish. The result is also provided by the marketing department of 3 enterprises in Shanghai. These data are to support the research basis of the paper, so the calculation formula is not discussed as key content.|$|E
40|$|The stormy years {{following}} {{introduction of the}} single market appear to be over at last. In {{spite of the fact}} that the premium level in the main segments was cut for good, insurers were for the first time able to impose substantial increases in premium rates in 2001, a development which is reflected in the consumer price index. Premium revenues were also augmented by a greater number of insured risks. The need for Austrian insurers to correct their price policy was driven chiefly by the negative actuarial results of the property and liability insurance. More than a third of the insurers in this business were unable to compensate losses from the actual insurance business by <b>income</b> <b>from</b> <b>investment.</b> Echoing the overall economic development, income from premiums on life insurance also showed stunted growth in 2001. The only volume to develop with genuine dynamism was that of annuity insurance premiums (+ 42. 8 percent). Payouts from life insurance rose dramatically in 2001, as a consequence of the 1996 tax reform which produced a surge in advanced insurance contracts. Those contracts are now beginning to mature. Demand for supplementary health insurance coverage has been declining for years, but insurers could still boost revenues by increasing premium payments. Expenditure on claims was affected by an increase of almost 3 percent in the number of claims incurred. After the disasters of 2000, the number of claims incurred levelled off throughout the property liability insurance sector. Developments in both revenues and expenditures markedly moderated the claims ratio for the entire business segment. In 2001, private insurers recorded the lowest growth rate of provisions during the past decade. The lower growth rate in actuarial reserves for life insurance was not fully compensated by the upswing in the two other segments. With regard to the portfolio structure, the shift from loans to mutual funds continues; cash holdings expanded considerably in 2001. The return on investment dipped slightly, so that the gap to the yield on federal bonds narrowed to some 1. 5 percentage points.
