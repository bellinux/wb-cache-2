I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
500|$|Inspiration for [...] "The Bill" [...] {{came when}} Shearsmith and Pemberton, {{the creators of}} Inside No. 9, saw a group arguing over a bill at a restaurant. Pemberton said that, unexpectedly, [...] "they were arguing about wanting to pay it, and we <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> and thought, 'Could that be one episode?' ... And then it's about {{sustaining}} that one idea". For him, [...] "when you're in the writing phase, you can see anything in day-to-day life that could spark your imagination"; after seeing this dispute, the writers immediately returned to their office to begin writing.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} the first verse of [...] "Born Again" [...] were written while Third Day's lead singer, Mac Powell, was folding laundry. Powell {{recalled}} that [...] "I was doing some chores at home. I was sitting {{down on the floor}} folding laundry and I had that song in my head. All of a sudden it just came out--a full first verse literally. It wasn’t like I said a line and worked out a few other lines, it literally <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out.</b> I just spoke it and sang it and it scared me because that never happens". Powell said he then [...] "got up and I was running around the house, throwing stuff everywhere looking for a pen and a piece of paper".|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{had first}} {{performed}} [...] "Vogue" [...] at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards, {{where she and}} her dancers were clad in 18th century-inspired fashions, inspired by Marie Antoinette. Madonna re-created an 18th-century French court, with sexual innuendo in the performance. At one point the singer flipped open her large skirt, allowing one of her dancers to crawl inside and come out through the other side. Her dancer Carlton Wilborn explained that [...] " [...] level of production had never been done on MTV. The costumes, the fans, the drama... MTV just had no idea, we <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> and rocked." [...] O'Brien described the performance as a [...] "moment of inspired brilliance", while Taraborrelli noted it as a [...] "classic, camp show that elevated the standards of future performances on that program". It was later ranked by Billboard as the sixth best performance {{in the history of the}} award show.|$|E
500|$|Country Grammar success {{cemented}} Nelly's {{position as}} one of the most successful hip hop acts of the emerging decade. Vibe emphasized Nelly's expeditious fame, writing that the rapper debuted without the benefit of [...] "guest spots or Pen and Pixel produced teasers on his CD cover". The magazine continued to note the rapper's absence of being associated with a notable group, [...] "he <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> and sold two million records in less than a month". Nelly's success helped in making St. Louis more notable for emerging hip hop acts, increasing the city's general reputation. Country Grammar experienced commercial success, topping the US Billboard 200 chart for five weeks in 2000, eventually going on to sell over 9 million copies in the US, making it the ninth best-selling rap album of all time in the country. It is one of the highest certified albums in the US history, being certified ten times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Nelly ranked third on the Billboard 2000–2009 decade-end chart, due to the success of Country Grammar as well as his follow-up album Nellyville (2002). The latter album went on to sell 6,488,000 copies in the US.|$|E
500|$|During a 2001 {{interview}} with Gary Graff from Wall of Sound Magazine, Maida recounted {{the inspiration for}} the lyrics of [...] "Are You Sad". He was in New York recording [...] "In Repair" [...] at the old Hit Factory studio, which was later known as Avatar Studios. Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through. [...] "When you're making a record, you kind of go into hiding, especially when I'm writing lyrics or writing music; I tend not {{to keep in touch with}} any friends or family or stuff. But my brother and I have a good relationship, and I want to keep it good. I couldn't get a hold of him for, like, a week, and I knew he was going through a shitty time — typical young-20s, no job, having a tough life. I wanted to talk to him desperately, and this song <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of me, [...] "Are You Sad?" [...] It came out really quickly on a shitty travel guitar". The meaning of [...] "If You Believe" [...] was revealed in a 2001 {{interview with}} Cleveland.com, [...] "That song's about having an out-of-body experience and seeing that the afterlife is real," [...] Maida confirms, [...] "and telling people that there's something machines can't have, and we've got it.|$|E

500|$|In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it {{was then}} learned that her {{biological}} father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: [...] "Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill." [...] During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps speaking about how her character has been thrown in different directions, Walton said: [...] "It used to bother me. I would try and keep a steady course with it, and now I can’t. Now I just roll with the punches. It’s impossible." [...] Walton noted that Jill was finally {{happy to have a}} blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: [...] "Liz dies within a week {{and all of a sudden}} it’s, 'I am a Fenmore'. And we really didn’t have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. My first thought as Jill is, 'I actually know who my blood is, and I have a sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister." [...] On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, [...] "Most people don’t like Jill, and she hasn’t particularly loved Lauren. I have never had that much to do with Lauren, really." [...] Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: [...] "The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father’s memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [...] and had no interest in a close relationship." [...] Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, [...] "From my point of view, I think that Lauren has a really big heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and that <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of her pain. So, it looks like Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet." ...|$|E

It's a noun and it's an adjective." [...] The word alien subsequently became the {{title of the}} film and, by extension, the name of the creature itself.|$|E

2500|$|Moreover, Moreton denounces night {{houses and}} cellars as places where prostitutes and thieves meet {{and carry on}} their hellish trade. Here criminals [...] "wait for signal of their scout; here they cast their schemes, and bring in advices; here they {{encourage}} and initiate young thieves; here they barter and sell their stolen goods; these are their exchanges and asylums after mischief". Thus, night houses stand as wicked fortresses for criminals {{and they must be}} suppressed. They were indeed real headquarters of felons, ideal places for the arrangement of their business and for the exchange of goods and information. Apparently they functioned as an unorthodox [...] "club" [...] for wandering criminals where you could be sure to be welcome and to find companionship if a juicy goal <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Norman Finkelstein {{argues that}} there has been no {{significant}} rise in antisemitism: [...] "What does the evidence show? There has been good investigation done, serious investigation. All the evidence shows there's no evidence at all for a rise of a new anti-Semitism, whether in Europe or in North America. The evidence is zero. And, in fact, there's a new book put out by an Israel stalwart. His name is Walter Laqueur, a very prominent scholar. It's called The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism. It <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out,</b> 2006, from Oxford University Press. He looks at the evidence, and he says no. There's some in Europe among the Muslim community, there's some anti-Semitism, but the notion that in the heart of European society or North American society there's anti-Semitism is preposterous. And in fact — or no, a significant rise in anti-Semitism is preposterous." ...|$|E
2500|$|Luhrmann was {{impressed}} with the verse-speaking of his Romeo, Leonardo DiCaprio, saying [...] "the words <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of his mouth as if it was the most natural language possible". Others were less kind: Daniel Rosenthal comments that [...] "DiCaprio's throwaway, sometimes inaudible delivery is, for those not inclined to swoon uncritically at his beauty, the movie's weakest link." [...] Juliet, the sixteen-year-old Claire Danes, was praised for portraying a poise and wisdom beyond her years, and as the first screen Juliet whose speech sounded spontaneous. Miriam Margolyes played the nurse for laughs as a plump Hispanic, forever crying [...] "Hooliet! Hooliet!" [...] Pete Postlethwaite, with his Celtic Cross tattoo, captures the [...] "charming ambiguity" [...] of the Friar. Paul Sorvino and Diane Venora play the Capulets as a boozy gangland patriarch and a miserable southern belle, unhappily married and frequently abusive to each other.|$|E

If I'm like a volcano and I'm about to explode, I better run to an instrument because it's about to come out. For me, I don't really go back. I probably should. I have a bajillion pieces of songs.

2500|$|Bruno {{took the}} fight to Lewis, but Lewis won the first round. Bruno then went on the {{offensive}} and took the second round, with Lewis trying to use his left jab to win points. Bruno hit Lewis {{on the right of}} his head in the third round, which shook him. Lewis later said that [...] "It didn't hurt me", but the punch concentrated Lewis' efforts on the job in hand. At the end of the sixth round, both Castellano and Roth had the fight level at 57–57, with Morgan scoring the fight 59–55 in favour of Bruno. At the start of the seventh round Bruno hit Lewis with a left jab and continued with a series of short punches. Lewis said [...] "He thought he had me... but actually I just lost my footing. I saw every punch coming". Lewis then hit Bruno with a looping left hook which staggered him, and continued with a series of head punches. Lewis said [...] "I saw him drop his right hand and <b>just</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> with my left hook". In a momentary break during the onslaught, Lewis was warned by Vann for stiff-arming with his left hand. Upon resuming Lewis finished off Bruno, who was by then staggering on unsteady legs and completely unable to defend himself. Vann stopped the fight one minute and twelve seconds into the seventh round.|$|E
