40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{research}} {{direction for the}} large family of instrumental musical interfaces where sound is generated using digital granular synthesis, and where interaction and control involve the (<b>fine)</b> <b>operation</b> of stiff, flat contact surfaces. First, within a historical context, a general absence of, and clear need for, tangible output that is dynamically instantiated by the grain-generating process itself is identified. Second, to fill this gap, a concrete general approach is proposed based on the careful construction of non-vibratory and vibratory force pulses, in a one-to-one relationship with sonic grains. An informal pilot psychophysics experiment initiating the approach was conducted, which took into account the two main cases for applying forces to the human skin: perpendicular, and lateral. Initial {{results indicate that the}} force pulse approach can enable perceivably multidimensional, tangible display of the ongoing grain-generating process. Moreover, it was found that this can be made to meaningfully happen (in real time) in the same timescale of basic sonic grain generation. This is not a trivial property, and provides an important and positive fundament for further developing this type of enhanced display. It also leads to the exciting prospect of making arbitrary sonic grains actual physical manipulanda.

40|$|AIM:To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} the surgical correction of high myopia using a posterior chamber phakic implantable contact lens(PCPICL). METHODS: Totally 79 eyes of 43 consecutive patients undergone ICL implantation or toric implantable contact lens(TICL) up to 2 a postoperative were retrospectively analyzed. Visual acuity, refraction, intraocular pressure(IOP), average cornea endothelial cell density(ECD), central vault of the ICL and slit-lamp findings, etc. at 1 d～ 2 a after operation were observed. RESULTS: The uncorrected visual acuity(UCVA) of all eyes was significantly improved from preoperative 3. 49 ± 0. 24 to postoperative 4. 89 ± 0. 17. Best corrected visual acuities(BCVA) didn't decline after operation and 91 %(72 eyes) of UCVAs were better than preoperative BCVAs. The preoperative spherical equivalent was - 12. 14 ± 4. 14 diopters(D) while it was - 0. 43 ± 0. 90 D at last follow-up. The difference on IOP at 1 d after operation(14. 82 ± 3. 46 mmHg) and preoperative(15. 59 ± 2. 66 mmHg) had statistical significance(P etc. were not found. CONCLUSION: After 2 a of follow-up,ICL implantation has good visual and refractive results with excellent biocompatibility and few adverse reactions. By accurate preoperative examination and measurement, intraoperative <b>fine</b> <b>operation</b> and close observation of postoperative follow-up, the complications can be effectively prevented.

Within the HEV, {{the best candidate}} for electric-propulsion system is Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (IPMSM). Despite of <b>fine</b> <b>operation,</b> constant state of flux and high cost due to limited and expensive rare-earth magnet price, alternative to the IPMSM was at desirable state. HEFSM was identified as new candidate of electric-propulsion system for HEV. HEFSM utilized both Permanent Magnet (PM) as primary excitation and Field Excitation Coil (FEC) as secondary excitation to produce flux. As such variable and high flux control capabilities make HEFSM more attractive. Thus HEFSM have the potential in improving torque and power density. On top of that, both PM and FEC was located at stator which make HEFSM become more robust and easy to design compared to the IPMSM. In this study, different model using 6 slot and various pole of HEFSM were designed using Geometry Editor in JMAG Designer Version 13. Simulation on the each model were completed. The measurement of HEFSM initial performance is critical to understand the condition and reaction of each model. Thus analysis {{on the performance of}} each model based 2 D finite element analysis (FEA) were performed at no-load and at load condition. Among performance analysis for HEFSM at no-load are UVW coil test, flux distribution and cogging torque. At load condition, each model of HEFSM were introduced by varied armature current densities (Ja) and FEC current densities (Je) from 0 to 30 A/mm 2. Hence investigation on performance such as Torque versus various current density and Torque versus Speed were executed. It is very vital to understand the performance of HEFSM at no load and at load are varied by adding 10 % of FEC circumference of cross section area.

This is mainly because with their applications the whole systems becomes more and more compact while enhancing the durability. On the other even with the more robust applications hand more accurate & <b>fine</b> <b>operation</b> could achieve by using such modern programming devices. This project was origin from based on an actual requirement of designing (10 v battery charging panel (to energize the batteries in spring charge type breakers) for electrical engineering division of Jaya Container Terminal(J. C. T) of Sri Lanka Ports Authority. But this technique would use to not only to charge batteries of spring charge breakers. but also batteries widely use in YHF communication hand held sets, explosive detectors, emergency lamps, etc [...] Rechargeable batteries are vital to portable electronic equipment such as laptop computers and cell phones. Fast charging circuits must be carefully designed and are highly dependent on the particular battery's chemistry. The most popular types of rechargeable batteries in use today are the Sealed-Lead-Acid (SLA), Nickel-Cadmium(NiCd), Nickel-Metal-Hydride (NiMH), and Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion). Li-Ion is fast becoming the chemistry of choice for many portable applications because it offers a high capacity-tosize (weight) ratio and a low self-discharge characteristic. Depending on the battery chemistry the charging characteristics of a battery differs to each other. In this project simply what I have done is allows the particular battery to follow its charging characteristic curve when they where you could not find in conventional charging techniques. The charging process is controlled by the software program microcontroller (PIC 16 F 876). Since the battery chemistries are different for different types of batteries, several sets of programs would have to written to the controller for each battery given by the manufacturer. There are some theoretical design calculations included for designing of power electronics modules. DCDC converter, square pulse generator, single rail power & dual rail power supplies,(etc [...] ) Calculations have been done based on highly theoretical facts. Therefore some practical observations are tends to differ from the theoretical approach. Most of the theories studied in the power electronic lessons of my M.

40|$|A {{microwave}} reflectometer is {{an instrument}} to measure a complex ratio between reflected and incident waves at an input port of a uniform transmission line that is terminated in a Device Under Test (DUT). The conventional reflectometer is formed by a four-port network with two ports connected to a microwave source and DUT, and the remaining ports coupled to a heterodyne receiver which acts as a Complex Ratio Detector (CRT). By using the heterodyne receiver technique, the two microwave signals at the input to CRT are converted in the linear manner to an Intermediate Frequency (IF) of hundreds of kHz where they are processed using digital means. As the ratio of two original microwave signals has to be preserved at IF, a very advanced electronic circuitry is required to accomplish the linear conversion process. This complicated electronic circuitry leads to a large size of the conventional reflectometer and its high price tag. Many applications require compact-size and low-cost reflectometers. They can be built using N-port networks, with N being greater than 5, equipped only in scalar (power) detectors. The thesis describes {{the concept of a}} multi-port reflectometer which determines the complex reflection coefficient of DUT with the use of scalar detectors instead of the complex ratio detector. It is shown that this device can be designed using an assembly of linear circuits in the form of quadrature (Q) and/or divider (D) hybrids. Assuming ideal operation of these components, it is shown that the reflection coefficient of DUT can be determined using simple mathematical operations on the power values measured by scalar detectors. Alternatively, it can be obtained from the intersection of power circles in a complex reflection coefficient plane. These simple mathematical expressions can be used to obtain an approximate real-time operation of reflectometer. For more accurate results, the multi-port has to be calibrated using calibration standards. A review of full calibration methods for a multi-port reflectometer is presented. In order to obtain wideband performance, the multi-port reflectometer has to be formed by components all having wideband performance. To obtain its low manufacturing cost, these components should preferably be of planar format and lead to a full integration of reflectometer. The thesis investigates a variety of planar couplers and dividers which can offer wideband performances. However, not all of them can lead to a fully integrated multi-port reflectometer. In order to overcome this shortfall, a multilayer microstrip-slot technique is proposed and investigated to obtain wideband components that can lead to a full integration of multi-port reflectometer. It is demonstrated that through the use of multilayer microstrip-slot technique, ultra wideband microwave 3 -dB couplers and two-way dividers of in-phase or out-of-phase type can be designed. It is shown that the chosen configurations of dividers are compatible with the 3 -dB couplers so that a fully integrated reflectometer can be formed. This compatibility is accomplished through the use of suitably designed microstrip to slotline transitions. An attractive feature of the designed couplers and dividers is that they are of sub-wavelength size and thus are very compact. A <b>fine</b> <b>operation</b> of these components is demonstrated via full electromagnetic wave simulations and experimental tests over and ultra wide frequency band of 3. 1 to 10. 6 GHz. Rogers substrate RO 4003 featuring a relative dielectric constant of 3. 38 and a loss tangent of 0. 0027 is chosen as a microwave substrate for the design of these components. The design and analysis are carried out with the commercially available full EM simulator CST Microwave Studio while the experimental tests are done with the Vector Network Analyser, HP 8510 C. By using these components, an ultra wideband complex ratio measuring unit (CRMU), which is the heart of a multi-port reflectometer, is designed. This CRMU is fully integrated and of compact size. Its operation over an ultra wide frequency band is demonstrated via simulations. A particular attention is paid to its real-time mode of operation. Using this mode of operation, the complex ratio of two waves can be displayed on an oscilloscope using an analog electronics performing simple mathematical operations on the measured powers by detectors. While discussing the operation of CRMU, the attention is paid to the location and spacing of power circles centres (q-points) which are used for geometrical interpretation of operation of this device. Good operation of CRMU in this approximate operation mode indicates that the device will operate very well when it is fully calibrated. For simulations of CRMU, CST Microwave Studio, Agilent’s Advanced Design System (ADS) and MATLAB software are applied. Having accomplished the successful design of CRMU, the last step includes the formation of a fully integrated multi-port reflectometer. To this purpose an extra circuitry including multilayer microstrip-slot 3 -dB couplers is added to CRMU. The purpose of this additional circuitry is to reroute the incident and reflected signals from the DUT to the input ports of CRMU. A few configurations of multi-port relectometer formed by multilayer microstrip-slot couplers or dividers are investigated via simulations with respect to real-time mode of operation. Then, the best performing configuration is selected for the final development. The device is manufactured in Rogers RO 4003 substrate. Its S-parameters are measured with HP 8510 C analyser and compared with the simulated values. Having obtained a relatively good agreement between the simulated and measured results, the device is calibrated using multiple calibration standards. Its operation is verified for selected DUTs by comparing the measured reflection coeffcients with those obtained using the conventional VNA (HP 8510 C) over an ultra wide frequency band. A relatively good agreement is obtained between the two sets of measured results. The obtained results prove that the multilayer microstrip-slot technology can successfully be used {{for the development of a}} compact low-cost and fully integrated UWB multi-port reflectometer. Because of its compact size and good electrical performance, this device can be used in many microwave sub-systems offering a limited space for implementation of microwave measurements. The thesis shows that the accomplished multi-port device can also be used to build UWB communication transceivers. The concept of such UWB transceivers is addressed in the final sections of this thesis...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} on ancient ferrous artefacts belonging to different historical periods has indicated {{significant differences in}} various parameters characterizing the slags entrapped in these artefacts, in cases where they were obtained by using different production methods. Such differences have been observed by comparing ‘‘ancient period’’ artefacts with ‘‘subsequent period’’ artefacts. ‘‘Ancient period’’ products were obtained by direct reduction of iron ore, without carburizing and at temperatures below the melting point of the reduced sponge iron. In the ‘‘subsequent period’’, the indirect process started to be introduced, with the production, in a first reduction stage, of a liquid cast iron {{that had to be}} converted to wrought iron during a second <b>fining</b> <b>operation.</b> The understanding of the characterizing parameters of the slags has in fact progressed {{to the point where they}} represent a useful tool not only for inferring the origins of the starting ore but also for distinguishing between direct or indirect production. In the present research work, an accurate study of the entrapped slags has been carried out on an artefact from the Val Gabbia III site, identified in previous studies as a miner’s chisel. This study aims to carry out further metallurgical investigation into the miner’s chisel microstructure and the entrapped slags in order to help ascertain which production method was in use at the Val Gabbia III site; in fact, based on the intrinsic characteristics of the chisel, and the fact that the site where it was found, i. e. layers of the V–VI cent AD in Val Gabbia III site, was characterized by the presence of an almost 3. 5 kg cast iron block, previous investigators were led to suppose that it may be a very early site of indirect iron smelting.
