Method : This was an explanatory research with cross sectional approach. This research took sample of 86 women in childbearing-age from four villages which were chosen purposively. Questionare, tool of blood sampling and laboratory testing, and sheet of laboratory result were used as instruments in this research. Data were collected by laboratory testing to blood samples and interviewing childbearing-age women. Result : All childbearing-age women had normal cholinesterase enzyme level, but 50 % of them had cholinesterase enzyme below mean level. Envolvement of childbearing-age women in farming activities was 74, 4 %. Based on cholinesterase enzyme level and envolvement in farming activities, it was concluded that 33 childbearing-age women (38, 4 %) had pesticides exposure.

Among them, anxiety holds a prioritary position. The aim of the research was to shed light on the signs and symptoms of craniomandibular <b>disfunction</b> manifested in a group of patients and on their possible association with psycho-emotional characteristics (stress, anxiety). Materials and method. A cross-sectional study was performed on a group of 54 subjects (16 M, 38 W), by means of a screening questionnaire for craniomandibular <b>disfunction,</b> containing 20 questions structured on five issues: pain, <b>disfunction,</b> parafunction, psycho-emotional status, trauma/iatrogenic condition. For psychological examination, the STAI I and II (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) questionnaires were applied. These psychometric instruments, containing 20 items, provide the current level of anxiety scores of the subject and the degree to which he/she is prone to anxiety. The NCSS Dawson edition statistical program was used to analyze the collected data. Results. The score of psycho-emotional characteristics evaluation correlates with the severity of craniomandibular <b>disfunction</b> (r = 0. 5743). The specific score of the signs and symptoms manifested in craniomandibular <b>disfunctions</b> shows a good correlation with the disfunctional condition (0. 7737). In the investigated group, fewer subjects assessed anxiety, however the predisposition to anxiety is the dominant trend, more evident in male subjects. Conclusions. Within the limits of this investigation, the psycho-emotional factors included in the screening questionnaire appear to play a role in defining a prioritary craniomandibular disfunctional state. At the same time, the results provided by the used psychometric instruments are less conclusive.

The effects of microcystins (MCYs), {{a family of}} peptide type protein-phosphatase inhibitors and cylindrospermopsin (CYN), an alkaloid type of protein synthesis blocker {{will be discussed in}} this review. We are focusing mainly on cyanotoxin-induced changes of chromatin organization and their possible cellular mechanisms. The particularities of plant cells explain the importance of such studies. Preprophase bands (PPBs) are premitotic cytoskeletal structures important in the determination of plant cell division plane. Phragmoplasts are cytoskeletal structures involved in plant cytokinesis. Both cyanotoxins induce the formation of multipolar spindles and disrupted phragmoplasts, leading to abnormal sister chromatid segregation during mitosis. Thus, MCY and CYN are probably inducing alterations of chromosome number. MCY induces programmed cell death: chromatin condensation, nucleus fragmentation, necrosis, alterations of nuclease and protease enzyme activities and patterns. The above effects may be related to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or <b>disfunctioning</b> of microtubule associated proteins. Specific effects: MCY-LR induces histone H 3 hyperphosphorylation leading to incomplete chromatid segregation and the formation of micronuclei. CYN induces the formation of split or double PPB directly related to protein synthesis inhibition. Cyanotoxins are powerful tools in the study of plant cell organization...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of anal fistulas {{in patients with}} IBD continues to be extremely challenging and, indeed, somewhat frustrating. Despite a global closure rate of about 75 %, all patients should be informed {{about the risk of}} infection, early failure, eventual temporary <b>disfunctioning</b> stoma and the possibility of late recurrence (about 15 %). Closure of a RVF in Crohn's disease should not be considered an easy undertaking, especially in patients with several Crohn localisations. The technique can be adapted to the local situation. Construction of a temporary stoma is not mandatory. However, stoma construction seems to be beneficial when extensive perianal or recto-vaginal dissection including eventual tissue interposition is required. Advancement flaps are an attractive surgical alternative for the {{management of}} all anal transsphincteric fistulas, also in Crohn's disease, because sphincter architecture and function are well preserved. Improved medical treatment and the changed approach from conservative to reparative surgery may well have resulted in a decreased need or at least in a delay of the need for a proctectomy. Although the surgical principles of advancement flap techniques are sound, these techniques have not been used for many decades.

Nevertheless, it has increasingly become liable to institutional complexity and central control in an emerging system - discussed as 'the project state' or 'projectified world' in recent literature. The intersection of different institutional realities (European, domestic, regional, local, sectoral, spatial, etc.) and the resulting institutional bricolage is inevitably contested.

40|$|Pantouflage" in France. The {{movement}} of upper-level bureaucrats {{into the private}} sector (le pantouflage) has been developing in France for about a century. This article attempts to synthesize the monographs on the subject, clarifying it {{in the light of}} new research and opening up new avenues of interpretation suggesting further studies. This phenomenon first appeared in the stratum of bureaucrats with technical capabilities (e. g. state engineers and finance inspectors), then in the main body of bureaucrats—due to political purges—and finally, in the twentieth century, amongst high-level army officers. The reasons vary with the particular stratum in question, economic and administrative conjonctures, the age of resigning bureaucrats and their social extraction. At a deeper level this phenomenon is a sign of the <b>disfunctioning</b> of the French administration, especially during the Third Republic but also of the lack, up until the years between the two World Wars, of channels designed to provide special training to upper-level officials in economic sectors who were partly siphoned off from the public sector. This "brain drain", whose importance should not be over-stated, was not entirely negative in its effects; it led in the long run to a reform of the administration's all too obvious shortcomings, and contributed to the indirect democratization of recruitment in business circles. It contributes to economic power's domination over th efield of administrative power, even when social differentiation of recruitment of these two types of elites is accentuated. Charle Christophe.

Several studies indicate that chronic inﬂammation or chronic psychosocial stress can induce, or at least con- tribute to, major depression. In this review the precise molecular pathway of p 38 MAPK in which chronic stress can eventually cause {{depression is}} discussed, with a synergistic role for proinﬂammatory cytokines. We propose a mechanism in which chronic stress acts on the adrenergic pathway, activating the p 38 MAPK and eventually increase the activity and afﬁnity of the serotonin transporter leading to a decrease of serotonin in the synapse. In addition, proinﬂammatory cytokines present due to systemic inﬂammation or peripheral inﬂammation, provide a positive feedback loop resulting in a chronic state of inﬂammation. Proinﬂammatory cytokines can also activate the adrenergic system and thereby creating a synergistic effect combined with chronic psychosocial stress resulting again in serotonin transporter <b>disfunctioning.</b> Alterations in the seroto- nergic system {{are known to have}} wide spread behavioral effects, which could lead to depression-like features. Furthermore, future research prospectives, new treatments possibilities and additional monitoring options are discussed.

Method Neurocognitive data were acquired for solid non-CNS tumor survivors (n= 20) and age-matched controls without history of cancer (n= 20) (age x ̅= 22. 34, [16. 14 - 30. 40 years], 18 females, 22 males) by using an extensive battery of cognitive assessments including intelligence, verbal and visual memory, and attentional functioning. Patients were treated according to different chemotherapy protocols i. e. EURAMOS 1, RMS 2005, NRSTS 2005, Euro-Ewing 99, MMT 95. Results After multivariate analysis for each main cognitive domain including all subscales, specific subfunctions were examined in univariate analyses, for all subscales separately. (1) Multivariate analyses MANOVAs yielded a main effect of patient vs. control for verbal memory (p=. 006) and attentional functioning (p=. 022). We did not find main effects for intellectual functioning (p=. 199), or visual memory (p=. 888). (2) Univariate analyses Specific comparisons showed significant differences between controls and survivors in false recognition of words (p<. 001), focused attention with increased memory load (p=. 049) and basic attentional reaction speed (p=. 022).

40|$|ABSTRACT Background : The high {{growth of}} motor vehicle in Central Java in 2000 reached 11, 8 % {{a year and}} from these number the city bus, 4, 5 %. This {{condition}} has seriously brought negative effect to environment. Many researchers found that the equipment of transportation and the industry are sources of air pollution, which very large and very dominant. The bus terminal is one location that is the highest air pollution than other locations because the bus terminal is a central of activities that need a transportation service. Beside that the bus terminal is a influence of sir quality dust, COx, NOx, SOx, in the bus terminal to the lung dysfunction of the permanent seller in the 15 prime bus terminals in Central Java, 2002 and to find the exposed duration, the work duration, the habit of smoking and age which can influence  the lung <b>disfunction.</b> Method : This was an analytic research using cross sectional approach. The samples of this research were 309 respondents (total population). The concentration of dust, COx, NOx, SOx, was directly  measured in the 15 prime bus terminals. The other data was measured by  interviewing with the sellers in the bus terminal who had been limited their ages (40 years old to down). The logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} test the influence of dust, COx, NOx, SOx, the exposed duration, the work duration, the habit of smoking and age. Result : The result of descriptive analysis shows that all variables have influence to the instance of the lung <b>disfunction.</b> It {{can be seen from the}} number of percentage of respondent who experienced the lung <b>disfunction</b> in  each variable. From analitical statistic, only the variable of anamnesis / the other diseases has influence which very significant to the instance of the lung <b>disfunction.</b> Other variables are risk factors to the instance of the lung <b>disfunction.</b> Key word : Dust, COx, NOx, SOx, concentration, interference lung – function, Seller, Bus Terminal...|$|R
40|$|End-stage chronic {{renal failure}} (CRF) is often {{associated}} with platelet' <b>disfunction</b> and therefore with impaired hemostasis. Several investigators have reported that rHu Epo, used in the treatment of CRF anaemia, is able to activate a broad spectrum of hematopoietic stem cells, and therefore is able {{to increase the number of}} platelets and to induce correction of platelet <b>disfunction.</b> In order to investigate hemostasis changes associated with rHu Epo we studied 8 dialysis patients before and 12 weeks after rHu Epo. RHu Epo did not induce any change in the number of platelets (187710 +/- 52690 vs 204430 +/- 68710; p = NS), but seemed to improve its function (MI% of aggregation with ADP: 46. 3 +/- 4. 4 % vs 49. 1 +/- 5. 3 %; p less than 0. 05). There was an improvement in PT (79. 0 +/- 3. 0 % vs 87. 5 +/- 8. 9 %; p less than 0. 02) and aPTT (33. 3 +/- 5. 9 " vs 29. 3 +/- 2. 1 "; p less than 0. 05) suggesting an improvement in platelet coagulant activities.
