40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to develop a testing specification on an <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>shaker</b> which ensures the qualification of a parking lighting device, whose pole is impacted by a car. The methodology is based on both a numerical approach and an experimental approach using an <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>shaker.</b> The first step of the analysis consists in modeling the structure and the excitation by means of a finite element approach. The calculation of the dynamic response of the "pole/lighting device " system to impact loading is repeated for different geometries of the pole. The second step is to consider each dynamic response at the fixing point of the lighting device on the pole as input for a base-excited single degree of freedom system. The theory developed for such a system allows to define severity criteria like the Shock Response Spectrum (SRS) which is the most representative criterion {{in the case of an}} impact. The severity of the vibration environment of the lighting device is then obtained by considering the envelope of the different computed SRS. Finally, different test specifications leading to equivalent SRS are proposed and the device is tested on an <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>shaker.</b> The developed methodology was applied to the NEMO lighting device (Schréder) ...|$|E

40|$|Need for {{increased}} productivity has motivated interest in drilling equipment for high speed and high precision drilling. However, long drills exhibit aggressive and self-excited vibrations known as whirling motions. These vibrations deteriorate the outcome drilled surface qualities, i. e., finish, geometrical dimensioning and tolerances. Deep hole boring {{is the most}} complex and expensive drilling operation in terms of expertise needed, operating conditions and size. The present research is to study the whirling vibrations of the boring bar workpiece system in the BTA deep hole boring process. After {{a review of the}} literature, a set of objectives is outlined for the thesis. The objectives are to formulate an analytical model, which will include the self-excited motion caused by the internal cutting forces in the Z and Y directions and the active suppression forces used to counteract the cutting forces. This model will be used to carry out simulation studies on the whirling vibrations of the boring bar-workpiece system and to carry out some experiments in order to validate the analytical model. In view of the large number of machining parameters that influence the system dynamics and the resulting surface finish, geometrical dimensioning and tolerancing on the workpiece, a fuzzy logic model is proposed for off line modeling. Such a model will be used to examine the results obtained in the experiments and to predict the best parametric combinations that will provide the required surface finish. This will constitute an open loop control of the vibrations. An active vibration suppression is carried out to reduce the whirling motion of the boring bar-workpiece system, which in turn will improve the surface finish.

40|$|Small <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>shakers</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly popular for diagnostic investigations of the human vestibular system. More specifically, they are used as mechanical stimulators for eliciting a vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP). However, it is largely unknown how shakers perform under typical measurement conditions, which considerably differ from the normal use of a shaker. Here, it is shown how the basic properties of a shaker can be determined without requiring special sensors such as accelerometers or force gauges. In essence, the mechanical parts of the shaker leave a signature in the electrical impedance, and an interpretation of this signature using a simple model allows for drawing conclusions about {{the properties of the}} shaker. The theory developed (which is quite general so that it is usable also in other contexts) is applied to experimental data obtained for the minishaker commonly used in VEMP measurements. It is shown that the experimental conditions substantially influence the properties of the shaker. Relevant factors are, in particular, the spatial orientation of the shaker (upright, horizontal or upside-down) and the static force acting on the table of the shaker (which in a real measurement corresponds to the force by which the shaker is pressed against the test person's head). These results underline the desirability of a proper standardization of VEMP measurements.

40|$|The tire dynamic {{transfer}} stiffness {{describes how}} a displacement enforced at the tire contact patch {{results in a}} force at the spindle-wheel interface. The dynamic transfer stiffness is expressed {{as a function of}} frequency and provides insight in the generation of vehicle interior structure-borne tire/road noise. The road surface texture excites the tire at the contact patch, resulting in structural waves travelling around the circumference of the tire. The tire sidewalls transfer these vibrations to the rim. The vibrational energy is then transmitted through the spindle-wheel interface toward the suspension and vehicle body. The resulting body panel and window vibrations cause noise radiation in the passenger compartment. It is known that the tire dynamic properties are dependent on the vibration amplitude. Therefore, the excitation levels during tire dynamic characterization tests should be similar as the excitation levels during operation of the tire. This is not possible with the classic excitation devices such as hammer and <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>shakers.</b> This paper presents an experimental method to obtain the dynamic transfer stiffness of a non-rolling tire which is excited at operational excitation levels. Therefore, a high-frequency 6 -DOF hydraulic shaker table (CUBE R ○) is used to excite the tire.

This method is limited to structures which fit onto the shaker facility. For large and unwieldy structures an alternative approach can be utilized which applies modal forces for the qualification. This testing concept is called Modal Force Combination (MFC) technique and replaces the base acceleration {{by a set of}} forces acting directly in a selected number of structural points. Modal forces are patterns of single forces that are able to excite single resonances and which can be applied by movable <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>shakers.</b> An advanced test strategy for the MFC technique is presented in this article.

First, a laboratory test bench consisting of a wheel/suspension/lower suspension A-arm assembly has been developed {{in order to identify}} the vibro-acoustic transmission paths (up to 250 Hz) for realistic road noise excitation of the wheel. Frequency Response Function (FRF) measurements between the excitation/control <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>shakers</b> and each suspension/chassis linkages are used to characterize the different transmission paths that transmit energy through the chassis of the car. Secondly, a FE/BE model (Finite/Boundary Elements) was developed to simulate the acoustic field of an automobile cabin interior.

A rarely performed dynamic testing of {{a representative sample}} of four nominally identical B&B open plan suspended ground floors in a real-life building has been carried out using state-of-the-art modal testing featuring a pair of simultaneously operating <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>shakers</b> and multi-channel data acquisition. The testing demonstrated that the floors have considerable transverse stiffness able to engage sizeable parts of the floor area {{in a manner similar to}} orthotropic plates. Although nominally identical, the four floors have somewhat different modal properties. In general, although open plan, the B&B floors tested developed considerable levels of non-proportional damping. This is possibly a consequence of friction between non-monolithic floor elements (in the beam-to-block and/or block-to-block contacts). By back analysis, using experimentally measured static stiffness and modal properties, a simple mathematical model of a rectangular simply supported orthotropic plate was verified as an applicable method for the calculation of modal properties of B&B floors tested. However, somewhat surprisingly, for this method to work, it was necessary to assume approximately 2. 5 times higher bending stiffness than that of just the beams in the B&B floors, which are the only structural elements in this type of construction. Transverse stiffness was estimated to be 8 % of this enhanced main stiffness. This is probably due to composite action of the in situ cast non-structural sand and cement screed and/or engaged friction stiffness between non-monolithically connected beams and blocks...|$|R
