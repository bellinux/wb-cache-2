Eventually he escaped the program again and resumed working solo.

40|$|SummaryWhen Drosophila {{imaginal discs}} regenerate, {{specific}} groups of cells can switch <b>disc</b> <b>identity</b> so that, for example, cells determined for leg identity switch to wing. Such switches in cell determination {{are known as}} transdetermination. We have developed a system by which individual cells are marked and monitored in vivo as they transdetermine so that their proliferation, cell sizes, and differentiation are accurately traced. Here, we document that when cells transdetermine, they do not convert to a younger cell cycle. Instead, cell cycle changes precede transdetermination and {{are different from those}} observed at any time in normal development. We propose {{that it is not a}} younger but a unique cell cycle progression and a big cell size that conditions the cells for developmental plasticity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCell {{proliferation}} {{is required}} for tissue regeneration, yet the dynamics of proliferation during regeneration are not well understood. Here we investigated the proliferation of eye and leg regeneration in fragments of Drosophila imaginal discs. Using twin spot clones, we followed the proliferation and fates of sister cells arising from the same mother cell in the regeneration blastema. We show that the mother cell gives rise to two sisters that participate equally in regeneration. However, when cells switch <b>disc</b> <b>identity</b> and transdetermine to another fate, they fail {{to turn off the}} cell cycle and continue dividing long after regeneration is complete. We further demonstrate that the regeneration blastema moves as a sweep of proliferation, in which cells are displaced. Our results suggest that regenerating cells stop dividing once the missing parts are formed, but if they undergo a switch in cell fate, the proliferation clock is reset...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-This report reviews various investigative {{activities}} and analyses surrounding {{a photograph of}} a purported unidentified flying object (UFO) taken on October 8, 1981 at about 11 :OO a. m. local time on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The evidence consisted of a single frame of 35 mm color film which showed a sharply focused disc-like object against a clear blue sky with wooded mountain peak nearby. Analyses of the original negative included micro-densitometry, computer enhancements, and other measure-ments intent upon showing a support thread, atmospheric disturbance, or other evidences of a hoax. These analyses suggest that the disc was a three dimensional object located at a distance of at least 30 feet from the camera; the object's surface albedo was diffuse and of lower luminance than sunlit cloud. Extensive interviews with the photographer (who never saw the aerial object), her husband and daughter and site survey tended to support the entire narrative account. The <b>identity</b> of the <b>disc</b> object remains unidentified...|$|R
40|$|The Polycomb-group (PcG) and trithorax-group (trxG) {{proteins}} ensure {{this function}} through their interplay at chromosomal elements, termed Cellular Memory Modules (CMMs), by creating stable and inheritable chromatin structures. By this way, CMMs {{are able to}} remember the embryonic state of transcription of homeotic genes and to maintain it throughout development. I asked whether such CMMs could also control expression of genes involved in patterning imaginal discs during larval development, which expression pattern may be modulated with time. The results demonstrate that expression {{of one of these}} genes, hedgehog, once activated, is maintained by a CMM even when the initial activator has disappeared. These experiments suggest that the chromatin-based epigenetic inheritance of gene expression involving CMMs may be widely spread. This implies that during imaginal disc patterning, the determination of a morphogenetic field is not only established by the surrounding combinations of signaling molecules but is also dependent from the history of the composing cells. Transdetermination is a switch of <b>disc</b> <b>identity</b> that occurs in some cells, under specific conditions, when cells are already determined. It was shown to appear in Drosophila when manually fragmented imaginal discs were cultivated {{for a period of time}} allowing several cell divisions. It is still unclear what factors are involved in the switch to the new identity and how cells are able to inherit it through cell divisions. I investigated the role of PcG and trxG genes in the determination and transdetermination of imaginal disc cells. My results show that reducing the concentration of some PcG members in the cells affects the frequency of transdetermination suggesting that some genes involved in the establishment of the new <b>disc</b> <b>identity</b> are targets of PcG-mediated regulation. Furthermore, PcG proteins may also be required for the accurate inheritance of the new transdetermined state through mitosis. These results suggest that the establishment and the maintenance of the new cell identity is generated through the switching of the activation state of the CMM of developmental genes. In conclusion, several conditions are defined that may favour or are necessary for transdetermination, in which a transient downregulation of some PcG/trxG proteins as well as several rounds of DNA replication may facilitate the switch of CMMs. Finally, I discuss these results with a perspective on how the control of CMM switching may have applications for medical research in tissue remodeling...|$|R
