40|$|Three major {{projects}} were undertaken during the Summer 2013 USRP Internship: (A) assisting the cTAPS group with component and pressure vessel system analyses and documentation, (B) designing a <b>hoisting</b> <b>fixture</b> for a solid rocket motor, (C) finding {{an alternative to}} removing the DOT rated gaseous nitrogen tank from the roof for hydrostatic testing. Hypergolic Material Assessments (HMAs) and pressure calculations were performed on components of pressure systems. Additionally, component information was logged in the Standard Parts Database to provide a location where system designers can find information regarding components, including their specifications and compatibility with fluids. A <b>hoisting</b> <b>fixture</b> was designed to hoist a solid rocket motor and meets the specifications related to stress and size. However, there are issues with the fixtures bolt head allotment, the bolt spacing, and {{the complexity of the}} part. Finally, calculations were performed on an expiring DOT rated gaseous nitrogen tank in an attempt to re-rate it per ASME standards. This was unsuccessful so other options are being explored for the tank. While much progress was made on all three projects, there is still work to be performed on each project to achieve the desired results...|$|E
