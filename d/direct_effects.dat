The total damage from the storm exceeded $85million (1970 USD, $480million 2008USD) and much of the agricultural and fishing capacity of the region was wiped out.

40|$|The judicially created {{doctrines of}} <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> and {{supremacy}} {{are the two}} essential foundations of European Community law as a supranational legal order. This paper analyses the interrelationship between the two doctrines. Because the European Court of Justice proclaimed <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> of Community law a year before supremacy, it is often thought that <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> was 'first'. This article demonstrates that the doctrine of supremacy {{is in fact a}} condition precedent for the doctrine of <b>direct</b> <b>effect,</b> even if it was specifically proclaimed later. This conclusion is logically compelling because <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> in the absence of supremacy would have resulted in an uneven development of Community law in the EC Member States.

In contrast, Apuleius's account has had <b>direct</b> <b>effects</b> in modern times.

Torrential rainfall in this area caused catastrophic flooding and mudslides which were responsible for at least 1,662 deaths in six countries; 1,500 of these casualties occurred in Guatemala alone. Initially, more than a thousand deaths were attributed to Hurricane Stan, but the National Hurricane Center postulates that all but less than 100 of the deaths were more related to the larger weather event. This was not definitively confirmed in the Tropical Cyclone Report for Hurricane Stan, though it is certain that only 80-100 deaths resulted from the <b>direct</b> <b>effects</b> of the hurricane.|$|E

40|$|This article assesses how, 50 {{years after}} the ECJ {{delivered}} its judgment in Van Gend en Loos (VGL), the doctrine of <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> of international law has fared outside the European Union. While obviously the core of VGL (that is, that it is EU law, not national law, which requires <b>direct</b> <b>effect)</b> is not replicated {{anywhere else in the}} world, the courts of a considerable number of states have been able to give <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> to international law. Against the background of an exceedingly heterogeneous practice, this article argues that the concept of <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> is characterized by a fundamental duality. <b>Direct</b> <b>effect</b> may function as a powerful sword that courts can use to pierce the boundary of the national legal order and protect individual rights where national law falls short. But more often than not, the conditions of <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> legitimize the non-application of international law and shield the national legal order from international law. International law provides support for both functions. But above all, it defers the choice between these functions to national courts. The practice of <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> of international law exposes how national courts play a critical political function at the intersection of legal orders...|$|R

This paper focuses on {{the application of the}} principal stratification approach for estimating the <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> of a randomized treatment. The approach is used to evaluate the <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> of treatment as the difference between the expectations of potential outcomes within latent subgroups of subjects for which the intermediate variable would be constant, regardless of the randomized treatment assignment. To derive an estimator of the <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> in cases in which the treatment and intermediate variables are dichotomous, we assume that the total effects are consistent between two standard populations. This assumption implies that the total effects are equal between two subpopulations with the same treatment assignment and a different intermediate behavior, or the total effects are equal between two subpopulations with a different treatment assignment and the same intermediate behavior. We show that the <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> corresponds to the standard intention-to-treat effect under this assumption. Causal inference Intention-to-treat Potential outcome Randomized trial...|$|R
