50|$|With <b>emotional</b> <b>memories,</b> {{corticosterone}} {{is largely}} associated with fear memory recognition. Studies {{have shown that}} when fear memories are reactivated or consolidated, levels of corticosterone increased. The increase in corticosterone is linked to anxiety relief. This finding depends on the time at which the administration of corticosterone took place as compared to when the fear conditioning took place; corticosterone can either facilitate or interrupt conditioned fear. Not only does corticosterone have effects on <b>emotional</b> <b>memories</b> but memory recognition and consolidation as well.|$|R
25|$|Two {{groups of}} {{individuals}} were investigated, those concerned with personal power, achievement, and independence (agentic group) or those concerned with relationships, interdependence, and others (communion group). Agentic types consistently recalled <b>emotional</b> <b>memories</b> {{of events that}} involved issues of agency such as those involving mastery, dominance, and humiliation.

25|$|<b>Emotional</b> <b>memory</b> {{and sleep}} {{has been a}} well-researched association. Emotional {{memories}} are consolidated greater during sleep, rather than neutral memories. Studies have investigated high valence and arousing words, in comparison to neutral words. Sleep enhances the consolidation of the high valence and arousing words and therefore these are remembered more post-sleep. This concept has been demonstrated in many studies {{using a variety of}} media such as pictures, film clips and words.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{circuitry}} {{involving the}} amygdala (which regulates emotions like anxiety and fear, stimulating the HPA Axis and sympathetic nervous system) and hippocampus (which is implicated in <b>emotional</b> <b>memory</b> {{along with the}} amygdala) is thought to underlie anxiety. People who have anxiety tend to show high activity in response to emotional stimuli in the amygdala. Some writers believe that excessive anxiety can lead to an overpotentiation of the limbic system (which includes the amygdala and nucleus accumbens), giving increased future anxiety, {{but this does not}} appear to have been proven.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{in general}} aids memory. REM sleep may favor the {{preservation}} of certain types of memories: specifically, procedural memory, spatial memory, and <b>emotional</b> <b>memory.</b> In rats, REM sleep increases following intensive learning, especially several hours after, and sometimes for multiple nights. Experimental REM sleep deprivation has sometimes inhibited memory consolidation, especially regarding complex processes (e.g., how to escape from an elaborate maze). In humans, the best evidence for REM's improvement of memory pertains to learning of procedures—new ways of moving the body (such as trampoline jumping), and new techniques of problem solving. REM deprivation seemed to impair declarative (i.e., factual) memory only in more complex cases, such as memories of longer stories. REM sleep apparently counteracts attempts to suppress certain thoughts.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} early <b>emotional</b> <b>memories</b> {{have been one}} of the most {{researched}} topics in modern scientific psychology. On the other hand, rigorous qualitative studies have been relatively rare, investigating the lived consequences of early <b>emotional</b> <b>memories.</b> The purpose of this paper is to report on some human scientific research results on the phenomenon, the lived persistent psychological meaning of early <b>emotional</b> <b>memories.</b> The study utilized Giorgi's descriptive phenomenological psychological method. A general psychological structure was discovered indicating constituents such as, the vividness of early emotional memories; emotional needs and coping strategies; everyday and life choices; as well as personal values attached to the meaning of an object that was present during the early emotional situation (a value experienced as contributing to the initial formation of an emotional life). The results might have implications for human service professionals in that they can contribute to a human scientific foundation in terms of understanding the persistent psychological meaning of early <b>emotional</b> <b>memories</b> as well as opening up for new venues of research on phenomena related to human memory, personality, and life-span developmental psychology...|$|R

40|$|Rapid eye {{movement}} (REM) sleep {{is considered to}} preferentially reprocess emotionally arousing memories. We tested this hypothesis by cueing <b>emotional</b> vs. neutral <b>memories</b> during REM and NREM sleep and wakefulness by presenting associated verbal memory cues after learning. Here we show that cueing during NREM sleep significantly improved <b>memory</b> for <b>emotional</b> pictures, while no cueing benefit was observed during REM sleep. On the oscillatory level, successful memory cueing during NREM sleep resulted in significant increases in theta and spindle oscillations with stronger responses for <b>emotional</b> than neutral <b>memories.</b> In contrast during REM sleep, solely cueing of neutral (but not <b>emotional)</b> <b>memories</b> was associated with increases in theta activity. Our results do not support a preferential role of REM sleep for <b>emotional</b> <b>memories,</b> but rather suggest that <b>emotional</b> arousal modulates <b>memory</b> replay and consolidation processes and their oscillatory correlates during NREM sleep...|$|R

2500|$|The {{depression}} of abandonment grief creates a sustained type of stress that constitutes an emotional trauma {{which can be}} severe enough to leave an emotional imprint on individuals' psychobiological functioning, affecting future choices and responses to rejection, loss, or disconnection. [...] A contributing factor to the trauma-producing event is that 'being left' triggers primal separation fear, {{also referred to as}} primal abandonment fear – the fear of being left with no one to take care of one’s vital needs. [...] Our first anxiety is a response to separation from Mother. [...] This sensation is stored in the amygdala – a structure set deep into the brain’s <b>emotional</b> <b>memory</b> system responsible for conditioning the fight/freeze/flight response to fear. [...] Primal fear may have been initiated by birth trauma and even have some prenatal antecedents. The <b>emotional</b> <b>memory</b> system is fairly intact at or before birth and lays down traces of the sensations and feelings of the infant’s separation experiences. [...] These primitive feelings are reawakened by later events, especially those reminiscent of unwanted or abrupt separations from a source of sustenance.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} found that {{adrenergic}} hormones, such as epinephrine, can produce retrograde enhancement of long-term memory in humans. The release of epinephrine due to emotionally stressful events, which is endogenous epinephrine, can modulate memory consolidation of the events, ensuring memory strength that is proportional to memory importance. Post-learning epinephrine activity also interacts with the degree of arousal associated with the initial coding. There is evidence that suggests epinephrine does have a role in long-term stress adaptation and <b>emotional</b> <b>memory</b> encoding specifically. Epinephrine may also play a role in elevating arousal and fear memory under particular pathological conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder.

During all three sessions as well as 8 months later, subjective emotional reactions to the memories were assessed.

40|$|Background and objectives: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is an {{effective}} therapy in reducing the impact of <b>emotional</b> autobiographical <b>memories,</b> in particular trauma memories. Effects of EMDR have been reproduced under laboratory conditions. It was consistently reported that making eye movements during recall of vivid and <b>emotional</b> autobiographical <b>memories</b> reduces their vividness and emotionality during later recall. However, in all lab studies hitherto <b>emotional</b> <b>memories</b> were studied. It is therefore unclear if {{the positive effects of}} eye movements are specific for <b>emotional</b> <b>memories</b> or if they occur also in vivid, but non-emotional memories. The Working Memory theory suggests that eye movements during recall reduces vividness of that memory during later recalls, irrespective of the emotionality of the memory. Insights from neurobiological science stress that emotions contribute to the (re) consolidation of memories. Based on these findings, a new theory 'the emotionality theory' suggests that effects of eye movements are bound to <b>emotional</b> <b>memories</b> and will not occur (or to a lesser degree) with emotionally neutral memories. Methods: The alteration in vividness and emotionality after making eye movements (EM) while recalling a memory, was compared between emotional- and neutral autobiographical memories. Participants were assigned to either the negative memory group or the neutral memory group in which they had to recollect two memories. Each participant completed two conditions: one of their memories was used for the Recall + EM condition and the other for the Recall-only condition. The order of conditions was counterbalanced and memories of both groups were matched on vividness. Results: In line with the emotionality theory, a significant reduction in vividness and emotionality emerges after Recall+EM with <b>emotional</b> <b>memories,</b> but not after Recall+EM with neutral memories. Conclusion: Emotion might be a crucial element in blurring the memory during EMDR...|$|R
5000|$|She {{has also}} been {{investigating}} how emotional arousal shapes memory. Mather and her graduate student Matthew Sutherland outlined an arousal-biased competition (ABC) model that they argue can account for a disparate array of <b>emotional</b> <b>memory</b> effects, including some effects that initially appear contradictory (e.g., emotion-induced retrograde amnesia vs. emotion-induced retrograde enhancement). ABC model posits that arousal leads to both [...] "winner-take-more" [...] and [...] "loser-take-less" [...] effects in memory by biasing competition to enhance high priority information and suppress low priority information. Priority is determined by both bottom-up salience and top-down goal relevance. Previous theories fail {{to account for the}} broad array of selective <b>emotional</b> <b>memory</b> effects in the literature, and so the ABC model fills a key theoretical hole in the field of <b>emotional</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A type {{of memory}} of main concern for memory erasure are {{emotional}} memories.

[...] An example of an <b>emotional</b> <b>memory</b> can be found in patients suffering from PTSD, for these patients a traumatic event has left a lasting <b>emotional</b> <b>memory</b> that can have powerful effects on a person even without them consciously retrieving the memory.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{studied the}} {{influence}} of emotions on autobiographical memory (AbM) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), characteristically triggering atrophy in the hippocampus and the amygdala, two crucial structures sustaining <b>memory</b> and <b>emotional</b> processing. Our first aim was to analyze {{the influence of}} emotion on AbM in AD patients, on both the proportion and the specificity of <b>emotional</b> <b>memories.</b> Additionally, we sought to determine the relationship of emotional AbM to amygdalar-hippocampal volumes. Eighteen prodromal to mild AD patients and 18 age-matched healthy controls were included. We obtained 30 autobiographical memories per participant using the modified Crovitz test (MCT). Analyses were performed on global scores, rates and specificity scores of the emotional vs. neutral categories of memories. Amygdalar-hippocampal volumes were extracted from 3 D T 1 -weighted MRI scans and tested for correlations with behavioral data. Overall, AD patients displayed a deficit in emotional AbMs as they elicited less <b>emotional</b> <b>memories</b> than the controls, however, the specificity of those memories was preserved. The deficit likely implied retrieval or storage as it was extended in time and without reminiscence bump effect. Global scores and rates of <b>emotional</b> <b>memories,</b> but not the specificity scores, were correlated to right amygdalar and hippocampal volumes, indicating that atrophy in these structures has {{a central role in}} the deficit observed. Conversely, <b>emotional</b> <b>memories</b> were more specific than neutral memories in both groups, reflecting an enhancement effect of emotion that could be supported by other brain regions that are spared during the early stages of the disease...|$|R
