5|$|Kinne's appeal, {{rather than}} {{overturning}} her sentence, lengthened it. The three-man superior court which heard <b>her</b> <b>case</b> overturned {{one aspect of}} her conviction—charges of attempted robbery—but upheld her murder conviction and increased her sentence from ten to thirteen years, saying that her original sentence had been too lenient.|$|E
5|$|About 10 {{years after}} the death of her father, Shi Jianqiao tracked down Sun Chuanfang in Tianjin. Shortly after 3pm on November 13, 1935, she {{approached}} him from behind while he was leading a sutra-recitation session at his lay-Buddhist society on Nanma Road. She then killed the kneeling former warlord by shooting him three times with her Browning pistol. After the assassination, she stayed at the crime scene to explain her deed and distribute mimeographed pamphlets to bystanders. <b>Her</b> <b>case</b> drew a significant amount of public and media attention.|$|E
5|$|Since her surrender, Power and {{her story}} {{have been the}} basis for a variety of books and even a {{television}} episode of Law & Order. The episode, entitled White Rabbit, was loosely based on <b>her</b> <b>case.</b> In the show, her character is called Susan Forrest and she is found after money from the robbery turns up in a private safety deposit box after a robbery. William Kunstler appears in the episode playing himself as Forrest's lawyer. The fifth season episode aired on October 19, 1994. Later her story was the basis for Dana Spiotta’s novel Eat the Document (2006).|$|E

50|$|Throughout her career, most of <b>her</b> <b>cases</b> have {{involved}} drug offenses, robberies, assaults, and elder abuse. One of <b>her</b> <b>cases</b> even involved an immigrant {{who had been}} tricked into a phony green card marriage {{with the promise of}} gaining citizenship privileges. Soon after this case, Lewis also prosecuted her first homicide. In December 2016, she was named the Albany County Street Crimes Unit's Bureau Chief.|$|R

5|$|Soon afterwards, Artabanes {{was indeed}} {{recalled}} to Constantinople, replaced in Africa by John Troglita. He received numerous honours from Justinian, {{and was named}} magister militum praesentalis, comes foederatorum and honorary consul. Despite these and his great popularity however, {{he was unable to}} achieve his ambition of marrying Praejecta: his wife came to the imperial capital and presented <b>her</b> <b>case</b> to the Empress Theodora. The Empress compelled Artabanes to retain his wife, and not until after Theodora's death in 548 was the Armenian general able to divorce himself. By then, however, Praejecta had already been remarried.|$|E
5|$|When both {{phases of}} the inquiry were completed, Laming began writing the final report. The Laming report, {{published}} on 28 January 2003, found that the agencies involved in her care had failed to protect her, and that on at least twelve occasions, workers involved in <b>her</b> <b>case</b> could have prevented her death, particularly condemning the senior managers involved. On {{the day of the}} launch of the report, Climbié's mother sang her daughter's favourite song as a tribute.|$|E
5|$|After Climbié's death, {{the parties}} {{involved}} in <b>her</b> <b>case</b> were widely criticised. A public inquiry, headed by Lord Laming, was ordered. It discovered numerous instances where Climbié could have been saved, noted {{that many of the}} organisations involved in her care were badly run, and discussed the racial aspects surrounding the case, as many of the participants were black. The subsequent report by Laming made numerous recommendations related to child protection in England. Climbié's death was largely responsible for the formation of the Every Child Matters initiative; the introduction of the Children Act 2004; the creation of the ContactPoint project, a government database designed to hold information on all children in England (now defunct after closure by the government of 2010); and the creation of the Office of the Children's Commissioner chaired by the Children's Commissioner for England.|$|E

5|$|After the incident, Bågenholm {{became a}} subject of fiction and medical textbooks, and <b>her</b> <b>case</b> has been {{discussed}} in the leading British medical journal The Lancet. On 25 October 2009 her story was featured on CNN's television program Another Day: Cheating Death. Hosted by Sanjay Gupta, the program features stories {{from people who have}} survived severe conditions against all odds. Bågenholm hoped the program would give the people watching it more knowledge of hypothermia. The story is also included in Gupta's companion book, Cheating Death: The Doctors and Medical Miracles that Are Saving Lives Against All Odds. On 30 October 2009, Bågenholm and Gilbert appeared together on the popular Norwegian NRK talk show Skavlan, hosted by Fredrik Skavlan.|$|E
5|$|Beginning at 8:00 the {{following}} day, Revithi ran the marathon course on her own. Before starting, {{she had the}} town's only teacher, the mayor, and the city magistrate sign a statement testifying to the time she departed from the village. She ran the race at a steady pace and reached Parapigmata (the place where the Evangelismos Hospital stands today, near the Hilton Athens) at 13:30 (5½hours). Revithi {{was not allowed to}} enter Panathinaiko Stadium—her race was stopped in Parapigmata by a few Greek military officers whom she asked to sign her handwritten report to certify her time of arrival in Athens. She stated to the reporters that she wanted to meet Timoleon Philimon (the General-Secretary of the Hellenic Olympic Committee) to present <b>her</b> <b>case.</b> Historians believe that she intended to present her documents to the Hellenic Olympic Committee in the hopes that they would recognize her achievement. Neither her reports nor documents from the Hellenic Olympic Committee have been discovered to provide corroboration.|$|E
5|$|Helen Palsgraf {{remained}} embittered {{about the}} loss of <b>her</b> <b>case.</b> She became mute, and suffered from other health problems prior to her death on October 27, 1945, at the age of 61. At the time of her death, Palsgraf was living in Richmond Hill, Queens with her daughter Elizabeth. Her former attorney, Wood, maintained a law office in the Woolworth Building until his death in 1972 at age 96. His opposing trial counsel, McNamara, remained with the LIRR's legal department until his retirement in 1959, while McNamara's superior and counsel of record, Keany, continued as the railroad's general solicitor until he died in 1935. Justice Humphrey retired in 1936, a year after he gained notoriety for presiding over the marriage of heiress Doris Duke; he died in 1940. Andrews retired at the end of 1928, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 70; he died in 1936. Cardozo was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1932 by President Herbert Hoover and served there until his death in 1938.|$|E

5|$|In February 2015, Jenner was {{involved}} in a fatal multiple-vehicle collision on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California. Kim Howe, an animal rights activist and actress, was killed when Jenner's SUV ran into Howe's car. Accounts of the sequence of collisions have varied, as have the number of people injured. Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges, but three civil lawsuits were brought by Howe's stepchildren and drivers of other cars involved in the collision. Jessica Steindorff, a Hollywood agent who was hit by Howe's car, settled <b>her</b> <b>case</b> in December 2015. Howe's stepchildren settled their case in January 2016. Financial details were not disclosed in either case.|$|E
5|$|Judge Appleby also {{threatened}} Kunstler with dismissal {{and contempt}} of court after he delivered an October 21, 1976 speech at nearby Rutgers University that in part discussed the upcoming trial, but later ruled that Kunstler could represent Shakur. Until obtaining a court order, Williams was forced to strip naked and undergo a body search before each visit with Shakur—during which Shakur was shackled to a bed by both ankles. Judge Appleby also refused to investigate a burglary of her defense counsel's office {{that resulted in the}} disappearance of trial documents, amounting to half of the legal papers related to <b>her</b> <b>case.</b> Her lawyers also claimed that their offices were bugged.|$|E
5|$|Singaporean {{courts have}} {{accepted}} the existence of both procedural and substantive legitimate expectations. In Re Siah Mooi Guat (1988), the applicant was a Malaysian national who was declared a prohibited immigrant under section 8(3)(k) of the Immigration Act and had her re-entry permit to Singapore and employment pass cancelled. As the applicant's appeal to the Minister for Home Affairs was rejected, the applicant took out an application to the High Court to quash {{the decision of the}} Minister. One ground of the application was that the applicant had a legitimate expectation to two procedural rights: the opportunity to make representations to the Minister before he considered <b>her</b> <b>case</b> under the Immigration Act, and the duty of the Minister to give reasons for his decision.|$|E

5|$|The Lines International {{conditions}} were applied {{by a different}} High Court judge {{in the case of}} Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009). The plaintiff argued that the Urban Redevelopment Authority ("URA") had not been transparent while processing her application for permission to redevelop her house, or had not given <b>her</b> <b>case</b> genuine consideration. The Court held that the URA had considered the planning approval application, and had explained to the plaintiff the implications of her proposal and had extended several invitations to discuss the proposal but the plaintiff had declined to amend her redevelopment plans. On these facts, the Court held that the URA had thoroughly considered the plaintiff's application and had not fettered its discretion.|$|E
5|$|The {{charges against}} Galle were dropped before <b>her</b> <b>case</b> went to trial. Mitchell's case was tried by county {{attorney}} Scott Tidwell, a political supporter of Roberts {{and the personal}} attorney for Arafiles, in February 2010. Both the TMB executive director and the county attorney in nearby Andrews County discouraged Tidwell from trying the case. At trial, Mitchell did not testify. The relationship between Arafiles and Roberts was explored during the proceedings. Arafiles introduced Roberts to a supplement-selling program known as Zrii, and recommended the supplements to his patients. Roberts sold the supplements, {{but he said that}} his friendship with Arafiles had not impacted his actions with the nurses and {{that he did not have}} a business relationship with Arafiles.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix Wright, a newly-hired defense {{attorney}} at the Fey and Co. law firm, agrees to represent {{his best friend}} Larry Butz, who {{has been charged with}} the murder of his girlfriend, Cindy Stone. With the help of his boss and mentor, Mia Fey, he proves that Frank Sahwit, the prosecution's star witness, is the real murderer. Shortly thereafter, Mia is killed in her office, and her younger sister Maya is arrested after the police find her name on a note left by Mia. Phoenix takes <b>her</b> <b>case,</b> facing off against Miles Edgeworth, an equally-talented prosecutor. Phoenix manages to identify Redd White, a professional blackmailer, as the real killer, only to find himself charged with the killing instead. Representing himself, he exposes White in court and gets justice for Mia. His reputation established, Phoenix takes on another case, this time defending Will Powers, the lead actor in a children's TV show, against accusations that he killed his co-star, Jack Hammer. In a bizarre twist, it is revealed that Dee Vasquez, the show's producer, committed the murder in self-defense after Hammer tried to kill her and frame Powers for her death.|$|E

25|$|In most civil trials, the {{plaintiff}} begins the proceedings {{by making a}} speech opening his or <b>her</b> <b>case.</b> After {{the plaintiff}} has presented all the evidence {{on his or her}} behalf, the defendant must {{decide whether or not to}} adduce evidence. If he or she elects not to do so, the plaintiff may make a speech closing his or <b>her</b> <b>case,</b> and the defendant then proceeds to state his or <b>her</b> <b>case.</b> However, if the defendant elects to adduce evidence, he or she proceeds to open his or <b>her</b> <b>case,</b> present the evidence on his or her behalf, and make a speech closing the case. The plaintiff may then make a speech in reply. If any party in his or her final speech raises a fresh point of law or cites any authority not previously cited, the other party may make a further speech in reply to that point of law or authority.|$|E
