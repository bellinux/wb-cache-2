5000|$|We {{recorded}} everything <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Latvia, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> band-mate’s Kaspars <b>studio.</b> So we hadn’t {{that much}} stress as we was alone there, {{it was like}} you are recording everything in your friends home. We recorded things, then went home and listened to them and if we aren’t satisfied, next time we rerecorded them. Kaspars asked not that much money for an hour as we’d spend in big professional studios. After all we did all of our albums this way - I mean <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Latvia, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> local friendly <b>studios.</b> I think {{we are used to}} it and possibly cannot record anything good in time limited foreign professional studios where every minute counts.|$|R

[...] "You see, <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> country we live contentedly, and can talk and move around as we please. But whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once stiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty. Of course that {{is all that is}} expected of us when we are on mantels and cabinets and drawing-room tables, but our lives are much pleasanter <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Can it be?' inquired the vicar with apprehension. 'Surely not, Mr. Knight, just <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> English Channel--close at our doors, as I may say.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{was really}} just us getting together, us recording, us taking it into mix with friends, and us {{releasing}} it directly to those people that are interested in it, with kind of very little fanfare... This was about us {{trying to make the}} recording as we could <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>studio</b> and make a nice package that was more about bein' proud of somethin' that we put out as opposed to whether or not it competes with Creed." ...|$|R

5000|$|By October 2013 The Arts Map {{had grown}} to include more than nine {{thousand}} listings in one hundred and seven countries, but despite that and the accolades garnered, the effort required to maintain the site [...] "consumed more time and creative energy" [...] than its founders had anticipated and they closed the site, replacing it with an announcement thanking all {{who had participated in}} the project. The announcement ended with the words, [...] "We are <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>studios</b> making art." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Avast Stubb," [...] cried Starbuck, [...] "let the Typhoon sing, {{and strike}} his harp <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy peace." ...|$|R

I went off my head, and I went to work at sea. I took a job on a ship for awhile....|$|R
6000|$|... "Tut, tut," [...] {{said the}} iron gentleman, {{who was the}} famous Captain Evan Shelby of King's Meadows, [...] "he'll leave her <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> {{settlements}} while he helps us fight Dragging Canoe and his Chickamauga pirates." ...|$|R

5000|$|Evidence {{spoke about}} the album's production, saying: [...] "Babu and I are doing the {{majority}} of the production, which is very different from when we were just excited to have two or three tracks on an album before. I think we still are excited just to have two or three on the album, but it's working out that we're getting more. It changes everything when you are really self-making an album and not hiring people. It's really different. Not to mention, we're making music <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>studio</b> with different mixing techniques. We're from an analog era, so we're doing things differently right now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, 'that's a {{pleasure}} all the greater for being deferred,'" [...] quoted Anne. [...] "I'm so glad {{we decided to}} spend our honeymoon here.

Respondents were asked which specialized classroom equipment they had access to. Computers for each individual/group and special tables {{are the most popular}} classroom fixtures, found in approximately half of the surveyed departments. However, we felt that these features were not unique to SCALE-UP classrooms so we did not include them <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>studio</b> match index.|$|R
5000|$|Says Rogue: [...] "I didn't {{want to do}} Rogue Wave unless I {{felt really}} excited again, like it was when we were {{starting}} out. So Pat and I hadn't hung out in like a year, and we just started playing <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>studio</b> <b>in</b> Oakland, {{and as soon as}} we started, it felt right.

5000|$|Then {{the opening}} was changed to: The whole country's {{talking about the}} honorable Marilyn Milian... of Judge Milian saying, [...] "Judge here!"... the hottest judge on television. of Judge saying, [...] "It's my ruling!"
