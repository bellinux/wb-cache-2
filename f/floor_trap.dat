50|$|What {{is known}} as the Old McCulloch County Jail is {{actually}} the second structure to serve as the county jail. The first jail was built soon after the county's 1876 official organization, the structure having been completed in 1878. The construction on the first jail proved to be of poor quality, and McCulloch's prisoners were eventually incarcerated in Mason and San Saba. A new facility was approved by the Commissioner's Court in 1908, and completed in 1910 at a cost of $14,418.75. Construction of the three-story, red brick Richardson Romanesque facility was done by Southern Structural Steel Company of San Antonio. The second floor housed the prisoners, while the first floor served as living quarters for the sheriff and his family, or for the deputies. The third floor consists of twin towers. The underside of the third floor had a hanging ring, with a second <b>floor</b> <b>trap</b> door to facilitate death by hanging. In both 1936 and 1938, Brady Creek (San Saba River) overflowed its banks and caused the living quarters to be flooded. When the county decided to build a newer facility in 1974, this jail became known as the Old McCulloch County Jail.|$|E
5000|$|Beside {{the open}} ground floor within the arches {{there are two}} more floors to the mill, the first, lower, or stone floor 15 ft above ground level, housing millstones, great spur wheel, hurst frame, sack hoist rope passing through the <b>floor</b> <b>trap,</b> and the upper, second, or hoist floor with brake wheel, main gearing (wallover), sack hoist pulley, {{and parts of the}} winding winch. The windshaft and the main parts of the winding system {{including}} the wind direction indicator is installed within the cap. The space inside the arches, until 1930, used to have a wooden structure to store the grain, and an open timber staircase to reach the milling floors. This structure was removed to prevent vandalism. The cap of the mill is a shallow dome which used to be covered with lead sheet, but also because of vandalism is now covered with aluminium. Between the cap and the top of the wall is a system of rollers running in a track plate allowing the cap to be rotated easily. There is a wind direction indicator on the roof which is continued into the interior, and a small repeat indicator at its lower end, so that the miller could set the mill without leaving his work. The lattice-type-sails are 60 ft span counter clock-wise rotation (seen from outside the mill; most of all windmills worldwide rotate clockwise seen from inside the mill - from [...] "under the wind") and with 450 sq ft of canvas. The arched tower covers a very small diameter of 22 ft and it has an unusual [...] "in cap" [...] winding gear for an English windmill, the cap being winded by a hand operated winch having spur and worm gears.|$|E
50|$|The fire burned for ten hours. Many {{were unable}} to find the exit in the darkness. The fire department's ladders only reached the eighth <b>floor,</b> <b>trapping</b> those from the ninth to the 22nd storeys. At least 38 people died leaping from windows to escape the inferno, some {{clinging}} to mattresses {{in an attempt to}} survive the fall. 12 helicopters were mobilised to try to rescue guests from the roof using aerial slings. One man fell to his death from a helicopter.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a floor gully come with grating to prevent the oviposition of Aedes aegypti in the <b>floor</b> <b>trap.</b> In order to conduct the test, two containers were placed into a mosquito cage (30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm). Both containers were filled with declorinated seasoned tap water and covered with floor gully c/w grating and normal floor gully, respectively. A total of 50 gravid Ae. aegypti females were then released into the cage and left for a week. All the eggs obtained from the test were allowed to remain inside the containers for the eggs to hatch. The number of hatched larvae was counted and recorded. Five replicates were conducted concurrently. There was a significant difference of Ae. aegypti larvae obtained between container with floor gully c/w grating and normal floor gully (p < 0. 05). A total of 96. 41 % reduction of Ae. aegypti larvae was obtained in the container with floor gully c/w grating compared with the normal floor gully, indicating that the floor gully c/w grating used in this study was able to prevent oviposition of Ae. aegypti in holding water...|$|E
25|$|The Duke's Company {{had already}} been using {{moveable}} scenery to good effect in their previous playhouses. It was first employed by Davenant at Rutland House, using shutters in grooves, which could be quickly slid open or closed to reveal a new scene, but Dorset Garden was also equipped to fly at least four separate people and large objects like a cloud covering the full width of the stage and carrying {{a large group of}} musicians (Psyche 1675). There were also numerous <b>floor</b> <b>traps.</b> It was designed for staging Restoration spectaculars, and was the only playhouse in London capable of all the effects these exuberant spectacles required.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Exhaustively {{enumerating}} all small error-prone substructures in arbitrary, finite-length low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes {{has been}} proven to be NP-complete. In this paper, we present two exhaustive search algorithms to find such small error-prone substructures of an arbitrary LDPC code given its parity-check matrix. One algorithm is guaranteed to find all error-prone substructures including stopping sets, trapping sets, and absorbing sets, which have no more than amax variable nodes and up to bmax induced odd-degree neighboring check nodes. The other algorithm is specially designed to find fully absorbing sets (FAS). Numerical results show that both of our proposed algorithms are more efficient in terms of execution time than another recently proposed exhaustive search algorithm [13]. Moreover, by properly initialization of the algorithm, the efficiency can be further improved for quasi-cyclic (QC) codes.

30|$|There is a {{possibility}} that plastic <b>floor</b> <b>traps</b> (PFTs) designed to exclude bats or dust and debris, may also have lowered insect catch. The largest number (83) of these were used at Kenilworth Castle where the overall catch rate was lower (p[*]<[*] 0.07, Mann–Whitney U test) in PFTs, 0.65 compared with 2.49 for the 276 simple blunder traps. Taking a single species, the crustacean woodlouse showed a catch rate in the PFTs of 0.385, compared to 0.511 for the blunder traps (p[*]<[*] 0.04, Mann–Whitney U test). The catch in PFTs tends to be dominated by crawling insects and larger flying insects may be excluded, so these traps may be less than ideal [2] and may fail to give a representative distribution of all insect species. Even on the open blunder traps not all insects are caught with the same efficiency, so it is necessary to be cautious {{about the extent to which}} the insects trapped represent the abundance in properties [13, 14].|$|R

500|$|What the {{technology}} and the visual experiences were can only be tenuously inferred from stage directions. Milhous concludes from a review of Dorset Garden performances that [...] "at a conservative estimate" [...] the theatre was equipped to fly at least four people independently, and had some very complex <b>floor</b> <b>traps</b> for [...] "transformations" [...] {{such as that of}} Proteus. The plates printed in the first edition of Elkanah Settle's Empress of Morocco (1673) (see detail, top right) are the only pictures of actual Restoration stage sets. Pepys' mentions of stage effects in his diary, 1660–68, give the modern reader some help in visualising what audiences saw in the 1660s, and even more in entering into their enthusiasms, but the 1660s were still early days. There are scarcely any descriptions or reactions preserved from the heyday of the machine play in the 1670s–90s, although a general idea of its technology can be gathered from the better-documented French and Italian opera scenery which inspired Thomas Betterton at Dorset Garden Theatre.|$|R
50|$|The {{terrain and}} the {{maps of the}} game are {{generated}} randomly, and players are given a variety of weapons such as ranged weapons like shotgun, pistol, sniper rifle, and melee weapons like katana. The game features four different classes: ninja, outlander, soldier, and constructor. Different classes have different abilities. For instance, high wall can only be built by the constructor class, while the ninja class's melee ability {{is much better than}} the other classes. Players can also destroy environmental objects and scenery items to obtain resources. When players obtain a yellow orb, the attack performed by the player will become stronger, and they will gain the ability to collect resources faster. Weapons can also be crafted, and the playable character's skills can be customized through upgrading and leveling up. Different parts, such as <b>floor,</b> <b>traps,</b> wall and roof, and whether they are made of wood, stone, or metal, are decided by players when they are building a fortified structure. A player versus player mode will also be featured, which will accommodate up to ten different players.|$|R

50|$|On 29 June 1995, the 5-story Sampoong Department Store in the Seocho District of Seoul, South Korea {{collapsed}} {{resulting in}} the deaths of 502 people. In April 1995, cracks began to appear in the ceiling of the fifth floor of the store's south wing due to the presence of an air-conditioning unit on the weakened roof of the poorly built structure. On the morning of 29 June, as the number of cracks in the ceiling increased dramatically, the top floor was closed and managers shut the air conditioning off. The store management failed to shut the building down or issue formal evacuation orders; however, the executives themselves left the premises as a precaution. Five hours before the collapse, the first of several loud bangs was heard emanating from the top floors, as the vibration of the air conditioning caused the cracks in the slabs to widen further. Amid customer reports of vibration, the air conditioning was turned off but the cracks in the floors had already grown to 10 cm. At about 5:00 p.m. local time, the fifth floor ceiling began to sink; by 5:57 p.m., the roof gave way, and the air conditioning unit crashed through into the already-overloaded fifth <b>floor,</b> <b>trapping</b> more than 1,500 people and killing 502.|$|R
50|$|On October 25, 1960, {{a massive}} gas {{explosion}} destroyed the building housing the Metropolitan Store at 439 Ouellette Avenue in Windsor, Ontario.

The explosion blew out the building's rear wall and the second <b>floor</b> collapsed, <b>trapping</b> employees and customers, many of whom were senior citizens who had been sitting earlier at the lunch counter. Hundreds of rescuers, many of them volunteers, scrambled through the rubble searching for the wounded and the dead. The furnace was being changed from coal to gas.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} types of trap primers. The simplest, {{typically}} for a <b>floor</b> drain's <b>trap,</b> is simply a connection from a nearby sink's drain {{so that when the}} sink is used, some of the water flow is diverted into one or more traps. More common is a primer that is connected to the potable water supply and activates when pressure fluctuations are sensed, such as the flushing of a nearby water closet. Others depend on occupancy sensors or timers. [...] Several manufacturers (e.g., Moen) produce laundry faucets with a built-in trap seal primer outlet.|$|R
25|$|A related {{issue is}} the methane {{clathrate}} reservoirs found under sediments on the ocean <b>floors.</b> These <b>trap</b> large amounts of the greenhouse gas methane, which ocean warming {{has the potential to}} release. In 2004 the global inventory of ocean methane clathrates was estimated to occupy between one and five million cubic kilometres. If all these clathrates were to be spread uniformly across the ocean floor, this would translate to a thickness between three and fourteen metres. This estimate corresponds to 500–2500 gigatonnes carbon (GtC), and can be compared with the 5000 GtC estimated for all other fossil fuel reserves.|$|R

The Winecoff Hotel had been advertised as [...] "absolutely fireproof." [...] While the hotel's steel structure was indeed protected against {{the effects of}} fire, the hotel's interior finishes were combustible, and the building's exit arrangements consisted of a single stairway serving all fifteen floors.

50|$|Albian Sands Energy Inc. is the {{operator}} of the Muskeg River Mine, an oil sands mining project located 75 km north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. It {{is a joint}} venture between Shell Canada (60%), Marathon Oil Canada (20%) and Chevron Canada (20%). The company's legal headquarters are located in the Shell Tower in Calgary, Alberta. Albian Sands got its name from the Albian Boreal Sea which, during the Albian stage of the Cretaceous (over 100 million years ago), moved over the McMurray sands and deposited a blanket of marine shale on its <b>floor</b> which <b>trapped</b> the hydrocarbons of the McMurray Formation. The oil sands resources of the Muskeg River Mine are a legacy of the Albian Sea.|$|R
50|$|The apartments {{had been}} {{illegally}} subdivided using drywall partitions.

Only two had an escape rope, which one of them had bought for himself. Two were killed in the fall: John G. Bellew and Lieutenant Curtis W. Meyran, who was in command of Ladder 27. The other four, Brendan Cawley, Jeff Cool, Joe DiBernardo, and Gene Stolowski, were severely injured and disabled and had to retire. DiBernardo died six years later; he had been promoted to lieutenant in May 2005 and Bellew received a posthumous promotion.|$|R
50|$|One {{fire that}} had {{a major impact on}} the {{foundation}} of the school wasa fire at the private Catholic school Our Lady of the Angels in 1958, in Chicago, Illinois. Children on the second <b>floor</b> were <b>trapped</b> there, with neither the teachers nor their students knowing {{how to get out of}} the building safely. Many children tried jumping out the window and many burned in the fire. The main cause of death was of being trapped in the building without an exit. Although the school had passed a fire inspection two months prior, having the correct amount of fire exits and fire extinguishers for that time, it lacked smoke detectors or adequate fire alarms and was overcrowded.|$|R
50|$|As {{they left}} the building, a teacher pulled the fire alarm, {{but it did not}} ring.
