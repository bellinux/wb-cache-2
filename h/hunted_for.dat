5|$|Birds are hunted in many {{countries}} around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as mallard, wigeon, shoveler and teal have for centuries been captured by wildfowlers, while pheasants, partridges, grouse, and snipe are among the terrestrial birds that are <b>hunted</b> <b>for</b> sport, generally with guns. In {{other parts of the}} world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where cassowaries, crowned pigeons, hornbills and megapodes are captured for food. Seabirds such as muttonbirds, penguins and auks have been <b>hunted</b> <b>for</b> food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the great auk, extinct. Seabird hunting continues at more moderate levels today, for instance with the traditional Māori harvest of sooty shearwater chicks.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras are <b>hunted</b> <b>for</b> their {{meat and}} pelts in some areas, and {{otherwise}} killed by humans who see their grazing as competition for livestock. In some areas, they are farmed, {{which has the}} effect of ensuring the wetland habitats are protected. Their survival is aided by their ability to breed rapidly.|$|E

5|$|The {{common eland}} is {{sometimes}} farmed and <b>hunted</b> <b>for</b> its meat, {{and in some}} cases can be better used than cattle because it is more suited to African climates. This has led to some Southern African farmers switching from cattle to eland. Common elands are also pictured as supporters in the coat of arms of Grootfontein, Namibia.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{population in}} towns near the Everglades hunted in the area. Raccoons and otters {{were the most}} widely <b>hunted</b> <b>for</b> their skins. Hunting often went unchecked; in one trip, a Lake Okeechobee hunter killed 250alligators and 172otters. Water birds were a particular target of plume hunting. Bird feathers were used in women's hats in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the major}} herbivores of {{southern}} and eastern Africa, the blue wildebeest {{plays an important role in}} the ecosystem and is a main prey item for large predators such as the lion. It is {{one of the}} animals that draws tourists to the area to observe big game and as such it is of major economic importance to the region. Traditionally blue wildebeest have been <b>hunted</b> <b>for</b> their hides and meat, the skin making good quality leather though the flesh is coarse, dry and rather hard.|$|E

5|$|During his 1904campaign to {{be elected}} governor, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward promised to drain the Everglades, and his later {{projects}} were more effective than Disston's. Broward's promises sparked a land boom facilitated by blatant errors in an engineer's report, pressure from real estate developers, and the burgeoning tourist industry throughout south Florida. The increased population brought hunters who went unchecked and had a devastating impact on the numbers of wading birds (<b>hunted</b> <b>for</b> their plumes), alligators, and other Everglades animals.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, a joint {{application}} {{submitted by}} the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) and the Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) {{was approved by the}} Scottish Government allowing for a trial reintroduction of the European beaver to the Knapdale Forest in Mid-Argyll. If the trial is successful then the European beaver will be the first mammal to be reintroduced to the United Kingdom. Beavers have been extinct in Scotland since the 16th century, when they were <b>hunted</b> <b>for</b> their pelt, meat and medicinal properties (use of castoreum).|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{economic}} uses, birds have been <b>hunted</b> <b>for</b> food since Palaeolithic times. They have been captured and bred as poultry to provide meat and eggs {{since at least the}} time of Ancient Egypt. Some species have been used, too, to help locate or to catch food, as with cormorant fishing and the use of honeyguides. Feathers have long been used for bedding, as well as for quill pens and for fletching arrows.|$|E
5|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} were once intensively <b>hunted</b> <b>for</b> their meat and eggs; {{consumption}} has decreased, however, due to worldwide legislation. Despite this, turtle meat and eggs are still consumed {{in countries where}} regulations are not strictly enforced. In Mexico, turtle eggs are a common meal; locals claim the egg is an aphrodisiac. Eating turtle eggs or meat can cause serious illness due to harmful bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens, {{and high levels of}} toxic metals that build up through bioaccumulation.|$|E
5|$|The short-finned {{pilot whale}} has also been <b>hunted</b> <b>for</b> many centuries, {{particularly}} by Japanese whalers. Between 1948 and 1980, hundreds of whales were exploited at Hokkaido and Sanriku {{in the north and}} Taiji, Izu, and Okinawa in the south. These fisheries were at their highest in the late 1940s and early 1950s; 2,326 {{short-finned pilot whale}}s were harvested in the mid- to late 1980s. This had decreased to about 400 per year by the 1990s.|$|E
