Observations on the interesting process of photosynthesis and the breakdown of organic matter was conducted by us on the eastern stretch of water in the Klyaz'minsk Reservoir during the growing periods of 1945 to 1948, by the widely applied bottle method (Vinberg 1934).

It is harmful to the whipping lash effect {{in the top of the}} high-rise building when it is forced, moved and deformed, the phenomenon of whipping lash effect is evident in high-rise building. In order to research the essence of the whipping lash effect and avoid it, firstly the whipping lash effect is introduced, also we have distinguished the whipping lash effect and cantilever structure by analysising the non-statically structure and statically structure. Then we have made three different high-rise building models which are put on the dead load, live load and horizontal seismic load, also we have gotten the maximum displacement, maximum displacement angle, velocity, acceleration, shear force and moment, then we have analysised and compared displacement, movement and force. Finally, we have concluded:“The vertical stiffness should be fixed up consistency and changed uniformly in order to reduce the influence of the whipping lash effect in the high-rise building...|$|R
