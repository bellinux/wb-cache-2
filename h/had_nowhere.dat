5|$|World War II {{dramatically}} {{changed the}} lives of Gibraltarians. The decision to enforce mass evacuation {{in order to increase}} the strength of the Rock with more military and naval personnel meant that most Gibraltarians (some for up to ten years) <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> to call 'home'. Only those civilians with essential jobs were allowed to stay but it gave the entire community a sense of being 'British' by sharing in the war effort.|$|E
5|$|After {{she turned}} 15, Falle {{had her first}} {{experience}} in the sex industry {{at a party in}} a bar in Chinatown, Calgary. A 25-year-old man at the party who had forged identity documents convinced her to sell sex for money and give him half of her earnings. Falle found this man well-dressed and attractive and did not think that he fit the stereotypical image of a pimp. She <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> to sleep that night and had no money for food, so she accepted his offer. The man to whom she sold sex that night had teeth that were rotten. They had sex on a soiled mattress in a poorly-ventilated restaurant attic, and she received $100.|$|E
5|$|Green was {{released}} from the police station in the early morning of October 24 after questioning. With the family home burned down, she <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> to stay. Farrar refused to let her stay in his apartment, but gave her some cash, and she rented a room in a local hotel. Ellen Ryan, Green's divorce lawyer, found her there later in the day in a distraught state. She repeatedly asked Ryan whether her children had died, chanted rhythmically about their deaths, and seemed unable to care for herself. Green was transported to a local hospital for treatment but remained emotionally unstable, suffering from insomnia and appearing to Ryan to be unable to take care of day-to-day life, even after her release from the hospital.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and 1970s, gay bathhousesnow {{primarily}} gay-owned and operatedbecame fully licensed gay establishments which soon became major gay institutions. These bathhouses served as informal gay meeting places, places where friends could meet and relax. Gay bathhouses frequently threw parties for Pride Day and were usually open, and busy, on public holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, when some gay men, {{particularly those who}} had been rejected by their families due to their sexual orientation, <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> else to go. The American writer Truman Capote was a regular at New York City baths in the 1970s, in particular the sauna at West 58th Street.|$|E
5|$|Rivera {{recommended}} closing Presidio de los Tejas {{and reducing}} the number of soldiers at the other presidios. His suggestions were approved in 1729, and 125troops were removed from Texas, leaving only 144soldiers divided between Los Adaes, La Bah√≠a, and San Antonio. The three East Texas missions which had depended on Presidio de los Tejas were relocated along the San Antonio River in May 1731, increasing the number of missions in the San Antonio area to five. The San Antonio missions usually contained fewer than 300Indians. Many of those who lived at the mission <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> else to go, and belonged to small tribes that have since become extinct.|$|E
5|$|The {{throwing}} {{became more}} intense as kick-off approached. Moments later, {{a group of}} Liverpool fans charged into section Z, causing the fans there to retreat. As they <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> to go, they moved towards the side perimeter wall. As more people moved up against the wall, it collapsed, which resulted in 39 deaths and injuries to 600 people. At {{the other end of}} the ground, Juventus fans began to riot in retaliation for the events in section Z. They advanced down the pitch towards the Liverpool fans and were stopped by the police. The resulting confrontation lasted two hours and was still ongoing when the match kicked-off.|$|E

5|$|His {{basketball}} {{performance in}} high school was unimpressive. He came off the bench to average four points per game (ppg). His stepmother informed him that when he graduated high school he would be {{thrown out of the}} house. Chris had been able to leave home on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, but Washington himself <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> to go. He trained for three hours a day {{toward the end of his}} senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at Maryland University to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.|$|E
5|$|The homeless, {{who were}} by {{majority}} South and Central American males, {{said that they}} came into the area from their respective countries in promise of work. A particular individual who was interviewed said that the work he was told about had only been short term and, along {{with many of the}} others, <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> else to go. Most who had been approached about relocation into nearby homeless shelters express their hesitation to leave the Grove Church Cemetery grounds, fearful that they would lose the freedom they had on the public property. Measures were taken to remove and clean up the cemetery, and it is believed that while some may have entered into shelters, others likely still reside in the general area, while some had moved into the wooded eastern side of the Palisades hills in Union City, where many shacks can be seen supporting the homeless.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} in Europe remained volatile into 1794. Off Northern France, the French Atlantic Fleet had mutinied due to errors in provisions and pay. In consequence, the French Navy officer corps suffered greatly {{from the effects}} of the Reign of Terror, with many experienced sailors being executed, imprisoned or dismissed from the service for perceived disloyalty. The shortage of provisions was more than a navy problem though; France itself was starving because the social upheavals of the previous year had combined with a harsh winter to ruin the harvest. By this time at war with all her neighbours, France <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> to turn for overland imports of fresh provisions. Eventually a solution to the food crisis was agreed by the National Convention: food produced in France's overseas colonies would be concentrated on board a fleet of merchant ships gathered in Chesapeake Bay, and augmented with food and goods purchased from the United States. During April and May 1794, the merchantmen would convoy the supplies across the Atlantic to Brest, protected by elements of the French Atlantic Fleet.|$|E

5|$|With the {{collapse}} of Magaw's outer lines {{to the south and}} east of the fort, the general American retreat towards the perceived safety of the fort took place. To the south, the third defensive line had never been completed so Cadwalader <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> left to retreat to except the fort. To the north, the riflemen under Rawlings still held, but barely, as there were fewer riflemen than before and because the increased amount of firing had jammed some of the men's weapons, some of the men were forced to push boulders down the hill at the attacking Hessians. The American battery at Fort Washington was silenced by Pearl. By this time, the riflemen's fire had almost ceased, and the Hessians slowly advanced up the hill and engaged the Americans in hand-to-hand fighting. Overpowering the Americans, the Hessians {{reached the top of the}} hill and swarmed into the redoubt with a bayonet charge, capturing it quickly.|$|E
5|$|From early 1929 Anderson {{lived with}} Annie Burr Jennings, a wealthy Park Avenue {{spinster}} happy to host someone {{she supposed to}} be a daughter of the Tsar. For eighteen months, Anderson was the toast of New York City society. Then a pattern of self-destructive behavior began that culminated in her throwing tantrums, killing her pet parakeet, and on one occasion running around naked on the roof. On 24 July 1930, Judge Peter Schmuck of the New York Supreme Court signed an order committing her to a mental hospital. Before she could be taken away, Anderson locked herself in her room, and the door was broken in with an axe. She was forcibly taken to the Four Winds Sanatorium in Westchester County, New York, where she remained for slightly over a year. In August 1932, Anderson returned to Germany accompanied by a private nurse in a locked cabin on the liner Deutschland. Jennings paid for the voyage, the stay at the Westchester sanatorium, and an additional six months' care in the psychiatric wing of a nursing home at Ilten near Hanover. On arrival at Ilten, Anderson was assessed as sane, but as the room was prepaid, and she <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> else to go, she stayed on in a suite in the sanatorium grounds.|$|E
5|$|Hotze was sorely missed. Despite mis-communication {{between and}} among the British, the Austrians and the Russians, the British miscalculation {{of the size of}} troops (consistently 10‚Äì25percent higher than they {{actually}} were), the lack of Swiss volunteers, and failed promises of transport mules, Suvorov organized his impressive march across the Alps from northern Italy, counting on Korsakov and his Austrian allies to hold Z√ºrich. His soldiers took the pass at St. Gotthard in a bayonet charge, and endured incredible hardships navigating the narrow trails of the Alps. By the time the Russian army reached Schwyz, preparing to descend from the mountains into the Z√ºrich plain, Mass√©na's army already had crushed the incompetent Korsakov's force at Z√ºrich, and, in Hotze's absence, Jean-de-Dieu Soult's French division overwhelmed the Austrian flank at Sch√§nis and crossed the Linth unhindered. When Suvorov cleared the mountains, he <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> to go; he was forced to withdraw in another arduous march into the Vorarlberg, where his starving and ragged army arrived in late October. Between Korsakov's inability to hold the French at Z√ºrich, and Hotze's death at Sch√§nis, the Swiss campaign degenerated to an utter shambles.|$|E

5|$|But {{during this}} period Japan's Navy Air Service was {{launching}} frequent air raids on the city, eventually totaling 50 raids according to the Navy's own records. The Navy Air Service had struck Nanking {{for the first time}} on August 15, and after winning air supremacy over the city on September 19 it began bombing the city night and day with impunity, hitting both military and civilian targets. In the face of Japanese bombs and the ongoing advance of the Japanese Army, the large majority of Nanking's citizens fled the city. By early December Nanking's population had dropped from its former total of more than one million to less than 500,000, a figure which included Chinese refugees from rural villages burned down by their own government's scorched earth policies. Most of those still in the city were very poor and <b>had</b> <b>nowhere</b> else to go. Foreign residents of Nanking were also repeatedly asked to leave the city which was becoming more and more chaotic under the strain of bombings, fires, looting by criminals, and electrical outages, but those few foreigners brave enough to stay behind strived to find a way to help the Chinese civilians who had been unable to leave. In late-November a group of them led by German citizen John Rabe established the Nanking Safety Zone in the center of the city, a self-proclaimed demilitarized zone where civilian refugees could congregate in order to hopefully escape the fighting. The safety zone was recognized by the Chinese government, and on December 8 Tang Shengzhi demanded that all civilians evacuate there.|$|E
