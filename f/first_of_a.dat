40|$|Various {{methods and}} systems related to chaos-based {{pseudo-random}} number generation are presented. In one example, among others, a system includes a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) to generate <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> digital outputs and a nonlinear post processing circuit {{to perform an}} exclusive OR (XOR) operation on <b>a</b> <b>first</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> current digital output of the PRNG and <b>a</b> permutated version <b>of</b> <b>a</b> corresponding <b>first</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> previous post processed output to generate <b>a</b> corresponding <b>first</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> current post processed output. In another example, a method includes receiving at least <b>a</b> <b>first</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> current output from a PRNG and performing an XOR operation on the <b>first</b> portion <b>of</b> the current PRNG output with <b>a</b> permutated version <b>of</b> <b>a</b> corresponding <b>first</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> previous post processed output to generate <b>a</b> corresponding <b>first</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> current post processed output...|$|R

The team lost its only {{game of the season}} to the Los Angeles Dons in October. Five more wins followed before a come-from-behind tie in November with the New York Yankees, the team Cleveland defeated in the 1946 AAFC championship. The Browns won their last two games, including a 42–0 shutout against the Baltimore Colts in the finale, to set up a championship game rematch with the Yankees in December. Cleveland beat the Yankees 14–3 in New York on an icy field to win its second championship in a row.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing how}} well the first film was made, {{the cast and crew}} signed for two sequels to be shot back-to-back, a {{practical}} decision on Disney's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio knew that with an ensemble cast, they weren't free to invent totally different situations and characters, as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and so had to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trilogy. They wanted to explore the reality of what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace {{at the end of the}} first film, and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device. They settled on introducing Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken, a mythology mentioned twice in the first film. They introduced the historical East India Trading Company (also mentioned in the first film), which for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.|$|E
5|$|Although England {{have played}} home matches almost {{exclusively}} at Twickenham since 1910, they have played at Huddersfield's Galpharm Stadium twice in 1998, at Old Trafford against New Zealand in 1997 and at Wembley Stadium against Canada in 1992.

5|$|An {{estimated}} 10,000 people met the Birmingham City {{party on}} {{their return to}} Snow Hill station. The players, in the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> convoy of four coaches, waved to the assembled crowds through the open sun-roof as they proceeded to the Council House, where the Lord Mayor welcomed them {{on behalf of the}} city. Len Boyd addressed the crowds from the balcony before the coaches continued through the city centre and back to St Andrew's, Birmingham City's home ground. The following Wednesday, a dinner was held to honour the club's achievements. Guests included the 84-year-old Billy Walton, who had joined the club in 1888, six members of Birmingham's 1931 cup final team, and a trade delegation from the Soviet city of Sverdlovsk.|$|E

5|$|By 04:30 on 14July, the 1st Parachute Battalion was {{in control}} of Primosole Bridge, but the Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion were well dug in to the south. Beyond them, 140 men of the 2nd Parachute Battalion had {{occupied}} the three small hills, and taken 500Italian prisoners. In numbers, both battalions had little more than company strength. The 3rd Parachute Battalion had suffered {{the worst in the}} scattered parachute drop, and only a few of their men had arrived at the bridge. With no command structure, they were attached to the 1st Parachute Battalion to help defend the bridge. To the north, the Italian 372nd Coastal Battalion and the 10th Arditi Regiment had been informed of the parachute landings. Many of the 372nd Battalion had disappeared, while the Arditi mounted the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of attacks on the British positions. Without the support of any heavy weapons, they were easily fought off.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1943, {{following}} {{the capture of}} southern Italy, Allied aircraft started to appear over the Balkans. NDH military command was aware of this danger {{and was trying to}} persuade the Germans to provide at least two squadrons of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters to the ZNDH. However, instead of Bf 109s, the only reinforcement fighters that came from Germany were the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> batch of 36 overhauled captured French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters in October, plus another dozen which arrived in December. The Germans also supplied 25 Beneš-Mráz Beta-Minor sporting two seater monoplanes, which were dispatched between the squadrons for liaison duty, as the lack of radio communications equipment at squadron level was still evident.|$|E
5|$|Carolingian support {{may have}} been one of the factors that helped Ecgberht achieve the {{military}} successes of the late 820s. However, the Rhenish and Frankish commercial networks collapsed at some time in the 820s or 830s, and in addition, a rebellion broke out in February 830 against Louis the Pious—the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series of internal conflicts that lasted through the 830s and beyond. These distractions may have prevented Louis from supporting Ecgberht. In this view, the withdrawal of Frankish influence would have left East Anglia, Mercia and Wessex to find a balance of power not dependent on outside aid.|$|E

5|$|Castillo Armas faced {{significant}} internal resistance, {{which was}} blamed on communist agitation. The government, plagued by corruption and soaring debt, became dependent on {{aid from the}} US. In 1957 Castillo Armas was assassinated by a palace guard with leftist sympathies. He was the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series of authoritarian rulers in Guatemala who were close allies of the US. His reversal of the reforms of his predecessors sparked a series of leftist insurgencies in the country after his death, culminating in the Guatemalan Civil War of 1960 to 1996.|$|E

His superior, NBC Sports vice president Chet Simmons, who alternated weekends with Connal as on-call in the event of difficulties, was also watching from his Manhattan home. NBC president Goodman and NBC Sports head Carl Lindemann also turned on the game, which was expected to be exciting, in their New York area homes. The Buffalo Bills–San Diego Chargers game, shown as the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> network doubleheader, was running long in its 2½-hour time slot, and NBC unhesitatingly cut its ending to go to the Jets and Raiders.|$|E
5|$|Dunston Power Station {{refers to}} a pair of {{adjacent}} coal-fired power stations in the North East of England, now demolished. They were built on the south bank of the River Tyne, in the western outskirts of Dunston in Gateshead. The two stations were built on a site which is now occupied by the MetroCentre. The first power station built on the site was known as Dunston A Power Station, and the second, which gradually replaced it between 1933 and 1950, was known as Dunston B Power Station. The A Station was, in its time, {{one of the largest in}} the country, and as well as burning coal had early open cycle gas turbine units. The B Station was the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new power station design, and stood as a landmark in the Tyne for over 50years. From the A Station's opening in 1910 until the B Station's demolition in 1986, they collectively operated from the early days of electricity generation in the United Kingdom, through the industry's nationalisation, and until a decade before its privatisation.|$|E
