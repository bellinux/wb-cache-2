30|$|The {{respective}} earnings figures {{based on}} own calculations with the 2012 {{wave of the}} German SOEP are uniformly lower than those obtained with the BIBB/BAuA Employment Survey 2012, but show a similar pattern. Self-employed men report higher gross earnings than male paid employees both on a monthly and on an hourly basis (€  3860 (Std. dev. 4316) vs. €  3017 (Std. dev. 1988) and €  21.1 (Std. dev. 24.2) vs. €  16.6 (Std. dev. 9.9), respectively), and female self-employed also report higher monthly and <b>hourly</b> <b>gross</b> <b>earnings</b> than their regularly employed counterparts (€  2279 (Std. dev. 2555) vs €  1860 (Std. dev. 1654) and €  18.1 (Std. dev. 23.2) vs. €  13.8 (Std. dev. 29.8), respectively).|$|R
40|$|Between 1978 and 1985 {{wages of}} male {{employees}} rose by nearly 30 percent. The {{main purpose of}} this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the determinants of individual wages in an attempt to account for this rise in real wages. We estimate a time series of cross-section wage equations for male employees in Great Britain using individual level data from the Family Expenditure Surveys for the period 1978 to 1985. Before demonstrating how a time series of cross-sections can be fruitfully used in accounting for growth in real wages, we pay special attention to returns to education. In particular, those in our sample hav been affected by several changes to the statutory minimum school leaving age. We test whether it is the absolute or the relative level of education in comparison to the minimum school leaving age that matters with regard to wage determination. To account for the change in real wages, we decompose the rise in <b>gross</b> average <b>hourly</b> <b>earnings</b> into two components: an element due to changes in the coefficients and another representing the effects of change in the variables themselves. We find that although variables demographic shifts., represented by changes in the variables, account for a notable proportion of the change in the real wage, the major influence is associated with changes in the coefficients...|$|R

50|$|Eurostat {{defines the}} (unadjusted) gender pay gap (or wage gap) as the {{difference}} between average <b>gross</b> <b>hourly</b> <b>earnings</b> of male paid employees and of female paid employees {{as a percentage of}} average <b>gross</b> <b>hourly</b> <b>earnings</b> of male paid employees. In other words, it is {{the difference between}} 1 and the gender pay ratio (gender pay ratio = (women's average earnings/men's average earnings)*100%). It serves to some extent as an indicator of gender inequality level within a country, but even more so for the unequal opportunities faced by women and men in the labor market. Also the indicator reflects the incompatible requirements of career and family as well as the poverty risk of single parent households, both problems which mostly women face.|$|E

50|$|At EU level, {{the gender}} pay gap {{is defined as}} the {{relative}} difference in the average <b>gross</b> <b>hourly</b> <b>earnings</b> of women and men within the economy as a whole. Eurostat found a persisting gender pay gap of 17.5% on average in the 27 EU Member States in 2008. There were considerable differences between the Member States, with the pay gap ranging from less than 10% in Italy, Slovenia, Malta, Romania, Belgium, Portugal, and Poland to more than 20% in Slovakia, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Germany, United Kingdom, and Greece and more than 25% in Estonia and Austria. However, taking into account the hours worked in Finland, men there only earned 0.4% more in net income than women.|$|E
30|$|One of {{the most}} notable stylised facts in labour {{economics}} is that women earn substantially less than men. For example, the European Commission (2010) reports an average gender gap in <b>gross</b> <b>hourly</b> <b>earnings</b> of about 17.6  per cent for the EU- 27 countries in 2007 and 23.0  per cent for Germany. Though part of this pay differential {{can be attributed to}} gender differences in education, occupation, or work experience, a considerable part of the gender pay gap remains unexplained (see, e.g., the large meta-analysis of Weichselbaumer and Winter-Ebmer (2005) comprising more than 260 international studies between the 1960 s and the 1990 s). While part of this unexplained gender pay gap may simply reflect differences in human capital or occupational segregation not controlled for, part of it may also reflect discrimination against women.|$|E
40|$|For years, the {{difference}} between the <b>gross</b> <b>hourly</b> <b>earnings</b> of women and of men has remained constant for German white-collar employees at about 30 percent. It is obvious that regional factors {{play an important role in}} explaining this difference. In rural areas, the gender pay gap is especially pronounced (2006 : 33 percent) while in metropolitan areas it is considerably lower than the average (2006 : 12 percent). This more favorable ratio is mainly due to the increased employment opportunities for highly-qualified women in cities. In addition, it is evident that where there are high levels of regional unemployment at the county level, women's pay suffers more than men's. The present study was based on the data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP). Focusing on white-collar salaried employees (Angestellte) allows us to analyze pay determinants on the basis of largely homogenous pay structures.

30|$|Compared {{to other}} countries, the gender wage gap in Austria is large. According to the EU gender wage gap indicator, the {{difference}} in mean wages was about 25.5  % of men’s wages in 2008 (Europian Commission 2011). The EU gender wage gap indicator measures the average difference between men’s and women’s <b>gross</b> <b>hourly</b> <b>earnings.</b> 1 Of all EU countries, only the Czech Republic fared worse. To reduce this gap, Austrian policy makers required firms to disclose the wages of their workers (Bundeskanzleramt 2010). Currently, only large firms are covered by the new law, but over time also smaller firms will need to disclose their workers’ wages. In addition, affirmative action with countries such as Norway and Spain as role models is often debated. Norway, for example, requires a minimum of 40  % of each gender in publicly appointed boards and in all boards of directors in private, shareholder-owned businesses. Spain imposed a similar rule for public sector committees and boards (Bagues and Esteve-Volart 2007).|$|E
40|$|Reducing {{the gender}} pay gap {{is a central}} element of EU equal {{opportunities}} policies. Since 1999 the EU employment Guidelines have included explicit reference to diminishing gender inequalities in pay. The 1995 Structure of Earnings Survey shows that on average there was a gap of 24 per cent in the <b>gross</b> <b>hourly</b> <b>earnings</b> {{of men and women}} working full-time (Benassi, 1999; Clarke, 2001). There is considerable cross-national variation {{in the size of the}} pay gap, ranging from 32 % in Greece to 13 per cent in Sweden. Initial analyses of these data show that even when controlling for major structural effects such as age, occupation and economic activity of employer a considerable gap remains. These analysis have been extended by Plasman et al. (2001) to consider the size of the gap when part-timers are included. Access to the SES micro-data will allow more detailed analysis of the gender pay gap across Europe. The initial element of the research in this work programme will be to apply decomposition techniques to the ESES data for each country, as recommended by the Belgian presidency report on indicators of gender pay equality. These models break down the pay gap into the share that can be accounted for by differences in the measured characteristic...|$|E
30|$|Before {{turning to}} a {{decomposition}} analysis, consider some simple OLS earnings regressions as displayed in Table  3. The table displays the results of regressions of logarithmic <b>gross</b> <b>hourly</b> <b>earnings</b> on a self-employment dummy and several control variables. The BIBB/BAuA Employment Survey 2012 contains exceptionally rich information on characteristics of individuals {{and in particular the}} jobs they perform, which enables one to account for a large set of control variables. To begin with, interviewees were asked about the specific skill requirements at their jobs. For eight different areas they were to state whether their work required basic or expert knowledge in this area. Examples are technical skills, economic skills, math skills, and legal knowledge. I include 16 dummies for basic and expert skills in these eight areas as control variables in the regressions. Further controls for human capital are the highest professional qualification (four dummies) and actual general and specific working experience. Actual general working experience is known because interviewees were asked when they were employed {{for the first time and}} also what the total amount of time of working intermissions was. Both variables are measured in years and included in the regressions in linear and squared form. Specific working experience is measured as tenure, i.e., years running the current business (years working at the current workplace for paid employees, respectively), and is also included in the regressions in linear and squared form. Regarding the job characteristics of individuals, interviewees were also asked in what tasks they were engaged. Examples are producing goods, quality control, purchasing or selling, advertising or marketing, etc. There were 17 tasks altogether, so I include 17 dummies capturing the tasks occurring at work. Additionally, eleven dummies capture the physical working environment of individuals, for instance, whether they were exposed to noise, dirt, or coldness. 12 Finally, several socio-demographic variables (migration background, family status, place of residence) are included as control variables.|$|E

Unlike most of the previous research on this topic, this paper organizes the data on the dispersion of family earnings not simply over time but also by age.
