40|$|Background: Nature {{of heavy}} metals in {{chemical}} compounds and their solubility in soil {{is so important}} in the transition of these hazardous materials into plants and water resources and such compounds pose {{a serious threat to}} human health. This study was carried out to evaluate the stabilization and solubility of Pb, Cd and Zn in contaminated soil using different chemical compounds. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, 36 soil samples were collected randomly from the industrial areas of Amol (Iran). Concentrations of Pb, Cd and Zn in samples were determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Moreover, solubility and removal of the heavy metals were investigated using potassium chloride, <b>ammonium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> <b>ammonium</b> acetate and DTPA. Results: Concentrations of Pb, Cd and Zn in soil samples were 206 Â± 59. 8, 11. 6 Â± 1. 8 and 1148 Â± 465 mg/kg, respectively. The mean solubility concentrations for Pb, Cd and Zn with <b>ammonium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> DTPA, <b>ammonium</b> acetate and distilled water (control) were 11, 1. 5 114. 5 191, 7. 1, 648. 5 115, 6. 2, 476 and 17, 3. 4, 193, respectively.
