The serious concern with these bonded joints is <b>disbond</b> initiation and growth in either quasi-static loading or fatigue loading and hence structural health monitoring of this bonded joints is important. Recent researches have proven that health monitoring using optical fibre sensors is the new technological innovation for easy interpretation and cost effective (figure 1). A novel optical method for monitoring the <b>disbond</b> in composite bonded joints using chirped fibre Bragg grating (CFBG) is presented in this paper.

40|$|Impact {{tests were}} carried out on {{composite}} laminates and composite scarf repairs, while both were subjected to in-plane loading with tensile pre-strain levels up to 5000 microstrain. The results show that pre-straining of the composite laminates has no noticeable influence {{on the size of}} the delamination area for the given impact energy of 8 J, which represents a typical barely-visible impact on thin-skin composite structures. For composite scarf joints, however, resulting damage has been found to be a combination of adhesive <b>disbonding</b> and matrix cracking (delamination and intraply cracking) in the composite laminate. The size of this mixed type of damage increases significantly with increasing pre-strain levels. A finite element model was developed to investigate the interaction between adhesive <b>disbonding</b> and composite delamination. The computational results reveal that both delamination and adhesive <b>disbonding</b> are dominated by the mode II fracture. Since the critical mode II fracture energy release rate for composite laminates (GIIC = 1. 08 kJ/m 2) is much less than that pertinent to the adhesive (GIIC = 3. 73 kJ/m 2), delamination tends to occur first in the composite laminates, which then shield the growth of <b>disbonding</b> in the adhesive...|$|E
40|$|There are {{currently}} no standard test methods for testing the cathodic <b>disbonding</b> properties of organic coatings at temperatures above 100 C. There are several subsea {{oil and gas}} reservoirs with high temperatures, some as high as 200 C. The main goal of this work was {{the development of a}} new apparatus and testing procedure for high temperature cathodic <b>disbonding,</b> hereby referred to as HTCD (High Temperature Cathodic <b>Disbonding).</b> A test method for the cathodic <b>disbonding</b> of organic coatings from submerged steel subjected to high temperatures was studied. The test method requires the use of a specialized HTCD apparatus. In this test method, sample plates were mounted between two channels, one containing a hot (150 C) oil flow and the other containing a pressurized, cold, salt (3. 5 % NaCl) water flow. Accelerated conditions made it possible to test the cathodic <b>disbonding</b> properties of several coatings in four weeks. Four weeks is a typical duration for coating prequalification tests. Several commercial coating products of different generic types provided by different manufacturers were tested. The results indicate that adequate coating products for high temperature underwater exposure are available. The required cathodic protection current for the samples tested in the HTCD apparatus was continuously monitored. No correlation between the required cathodic protection current and the extent of cathodic <b>disbonding</b> was observed. A long term test with more field like conditions and a duration of 400 days was performed. Low levels of <b>disbonding</b> for most of the tested products in the 400 day test made comparison to the accelerated tests difficult. An attempt was made to determine the oxygen diffusion coefficient of five coating products. The attempt was unsuccessful. The same method had previously been used to study coatings with a thickness of up to 300 micro m, the coatings studied in this work were between 600 micro-metres and 1200 micro-metres. It remains uncertain whether the chosen method can be used for coatings this thick. Results from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, performed in a pressurized vessel, showed a large reduction in the ionic resistance of a submerged organic coating upon heating from 30 C to 150 C. This showed that elevated temperatures throughout the coating can reduce the ionic resistance to a level where even an intact coating is incapable of protecting the substrate. Studies of coating samples at ambient temperatures after exposure to higher temperatures showed that exposure to heat causes a lasting reduction in impedance. High impedances correlated with good performance in the HTCD tests.
