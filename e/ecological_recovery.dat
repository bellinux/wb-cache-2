While the land of serious desertification was diminished by a big margin which decreased 26. 48 %. Moderate and light desertification was increased.

40|$|Karst rocky {{desertification}} occurs after vegetation deteriorates as {{a result}} of intensive land use, which leads to severe water loss and soil erosion and exposes basement rocks, creating a rocky landscape. Karst rocky desertification is found in humid areas in southwest China, the region most seriously affected by rocky desertification in the world. In order to promote ecological restoration and help peasants out of poverty, the Chinese government carried out the first phase of a rocky desertification control project from 2006 to 2015, which initially contained the expansion of rocky desertification. Currently, the Chinese government is prepared to implement {{the second phase of the}} rocky desertification control project, and therefore it is essential to summarise the lessons learned over the last 10 years of the first phase.

In addition, we put forward several policy suggestions that take into account the perspective of local peasants, scientific research, and China's economic development and urbanisation process.

40|$|Abstract. We used {{methods such as}} {{microorganism}} cultivation and PCR-DGGE {{to examine}} the influence of glyphosate, paraquat, and “xiao suo ” (used exclusively in China) on biodiversity. Two weeks after herbicide application, the strongest herbicidal effect was observed from paraquat, followed by glyphosate and then “xiao suo”. Although weed suppression was maintained over the effective period of each herbicide, surface vegetation gradually recovered after one month. Levels of soil bacteria and fungi were noticeably altered by exposure to herbicide. Actinomycetes were unaffected, however. Bacterial genetic diversity obviously changed, with some DGGE bands disappearing. Although several DGGE bands were lost, fungal genetic diversity remained constant. Actinomycetes remained constant. Overall, glyphosate and paraquat had stronger culling effects on surface plants than “xiao suo”, whereas glyphosate and “xiao suo ” had stronger effects on soil microorganisms than paraquat. The results have implications for agriculture production, and provide information related to soil <b>ecological</b> stability and <b>recovery</b> for use in ecological management of economic forests...|$|R

However, the {{integrity}} and biodiversity of many ecosystems is experiencing rapid transformation {{under the influence of}} a wide array of human and natural disturbances. In order to disentangle the effects of human and natural disturbance regimes at different spatial and temporal scales, we selected six terrestrial (temperate montane forests, montane cloud forests, tropical rain forests, tropical semi-deciduous forests, tropical dry forests, and deserts) and four aquatic (coral reefs, mangrove forests, kelp forests and saline lakes) ecosystems. We used semiquantitative statistical methods to assess (1) the most important agents of disturbance affecting the ecosystems, (2) the vulnerability of each ecosystem to anthropogenic and natural disturbance, and (3) the differences in ecosystem disturbance regimes and their resilience. Our analysis indicates a significant variation in <b>ecological</b> responses, <b>recovery</b> capacity, and resilience among ecosystems. The constant and widespread presence of human impacts on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is reflected either in reduced area coverage for most systems, or reduced productivity and biodiversity, particularly in the case of fragile ecosystems (e. g., rain forests, coral reefs). In all cases, the interaction between historical human impacts and episodic high intensity natural disturbance (e. g., hurricanes, fires) has triggered a reduction in species diversity and induced significant changes in habitat distribution or species dominance.
