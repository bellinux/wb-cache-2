500|$|Bassist Stephen Travers {{was seriously}} wounded by a <b>dum-dum</b> <b>bullet</b> which had struck {{him when the}} gunmen had first begun shooting. He survived by pretending he was dead, as he lay beside the body of McCoy. Saxophone player Des McAlea was hit by the minibus's door when it was blown off in the explosion, but was not badly wounded. He lay hidden in thick undergrowth, undetected by the gunmen. He also survived. However, the flames from the burning hedge (which had been set on fire by the explosion) soon came dangerously close to where he lay; {{he was forced to}} leave his hiding spot. By this time the gunmen had left the scene, {{assuming}} everyone else had been killed. Travers later recalled hearing one of the departing gunmen tell his comrade who had kicked McCoy's body {{to make sure he was}} not alive: [...] "Come on, those bastards are dead. I got them with dum-dums". McAlea made his way up the embankment to the main road where he hitched a lift to alert the RUC at their barracks in Newry.|$|E
60|$|What {{is usually}} {{known as the}} <b>dum-dum</b> <b>bullet</b> is a 'soft-nosed' one: but the {{regulation}} Mark II. is also made at the dum-dum factory, and the Boers, seeing the dum-dum label on boxes containing the latter, naturally thought the contents were the soft-nosed, which they were not.|$|E
6000|$|The {{power of}} the new Lee-Metford rifle with the new Dum-Dum bullet--it is now called, though not officially, the [...] "ek-dum" [...] [Hindustani for [...] "at once."] bullet--is tremendous. The {{soldiers}} who have used it have the utmost confidence in their weapon. Up to 500 yards there is no difficulty about judging the range, as it shoots quite straight, or, technically speaking, has a flat trajectory. This is of the greatest value. Of the bullet it may be said, that its stopping power is all that could be desired. The <b>Dum-Dum</b> <b>bullet,</b> though not explosive, is expansive. The original Lee-Metford bullet was a pellet of lead covered by a nickel case with an opening at the base. In the improved bullet this outer case has been drawn backward, making {{the hole in the}} base a little smaller and leaving the lead at the tip exposed. The result is a wonderful and from the technical point of view a beautiful machine. On striking a bone this causes the bullet to [...] "set up" [...] or spread out, and it then tears and splinters everything before it, causing wounds which in the body must be generally mortal and in any limb necessitate amputation. Continental critics have asked whether such a bullet is not a violation of the Geneva or St. Petersburg Conventions; but no clause of these international agreements forbids expansive bullets, and the only provision on the subject is that shells less than a certain size shall not be employed. I would observe that bullets are primarily intended to kill, and that these bullets do their duty most effectually, without causing any more pain to those struck by them, than the ordinary lead variety. As the enemy obtained some Lee-Metford rifles and Dum-Dum ammunition during the progress of the fighting, information on this latter point is forthcoming. The sensation is described as similar to that produced by any bullet--a violent numbing blow, followed by a sense of injury and weakness, but little actual pain at the time. Indeed, now-a-days, very few people are so unfortunate as to suffer much pain from wounds, except during the period of recovery. A man is hit. In a quarter of an hour, that is to say, before the shock has passed away and the pain begins, he is usually at the dressing station. Here he is given morphia injections, which reduce all sensations to a uniform dullness. In this state he remains until he is placed under chloroform and operated on.|$|E

5000|$|In Ian Fleming's novel, the Golden Gun was a long-barrelled, gold-plated, single-action Colt Peacemaker [...]45 calibre {{revolver}} that fired silver-jacketed bullets {{with a gold}} core. However, in the film, it was a single-shot {{weapon that}} fired a custom made 4.2-millimetre golden (23-carat gold with traces of nickel) <b>dum-dum</b> <b>bullet.</b> The movie gun could be disassembled and its components disguised as a fountain pen (the barrel), a cigarette lighter (breech), cuff-link (trigger), and a cigarette case (the grip), all gold-plated.|$|E
50|$|Kilborn and {{his wife}} Janet set out for west China {{in the autumn of}} 1921. After {{arriving}} at Chengdu, he started medical work in Pengxian county and took Mandarin lessons simultaneously. About {{a year and a half}} later, he moved from Pengxian county back to Chengdu where he began his teaching career as a physiology lecturer. Quickly rising through the ranks of the academic world, Leslie became the dean of the Department of Physiology and deputy section head of the medical division. In 1925, Kilborn was seriously injured by a <b>dum-dum</b> <b>bullet.</b> He needed four months to recover partially and his wounds left him with a permanently disabled shoulder. His new disability hindered his penchant for missionary work, making it difficult for him to move around and carry out daily activities.|$|E
5000|$|British {{soldiers}} {{threatened to}} kill a Chinese old man, unless he gave them his treasure. On learning he had no treasure, a rifleman prepared to bayonet the old man dead. That rifleman was stopped by another soldier, who told him: [...] "No, not that way! I'm going to shoot him. I've always had a longing to see what sort of wound a <b>dum-dum</b> <b>bullet</b> will make, and by Christ, I am going to try one on this blasted Chink!" [...] After shooting the Chinese old man in the face, the British soldier exclaimed: [...] "Christ, the dum-dum has blown the back out of his bloody nut!" [...] Moreover, the British journalist George Lynch said, [...] "there are things that I must not write, and {{that may not be}} printed in England, which would seem to show that this Western civilization of ours is merely a veneer over savagery".|$|E

5000|$|After the withdrawal, Major Meredith {{compared}} the emus to Zulus and {{commented on the}} striking manoeuvrability of the emus, even while badly wounded. If we had a military division with the bullet-carrying capacity of these birds it would face any army in the world... They can face machine guns with the invulnerability of tanks. They are like Zulus whom even <b>dum-dum</b> <b>bullets</b> could not stop.|$|R
25|$|The war {{was full}} of cruelty: the Ethiopians used <b>Dum-dum</b> <b>bullets</b> (prohibited by the Hague Convention of 1899, Declaration IV,3) and the Italians used gas (prohibited under the Geneva Protocol of 1922). Many Ethiopians died in the invasion. The Negus claimed that more than 275,000 Ethiopian fighters were killed {{compared}} to only 1,537 Italians, while the Italian authorities estimated that 16,000 Ethiopians and 2,700 Italians (including Italian colonial troops) died in battle.|$|R

5000|$|The U.S. Cavalry {{had been}} buying and testing various handguns {{in the late}} 1890s and early 20th century. The [...]45 Colt Single Action Army (SAA) had largely been replaced, even by some {{double-action}} {{versions of the same}} caliber. The Army had fielded some double-action revolvers in [...]38 Long Colt. They determined the [...]38 caliber round was significantly less effective than the [...]45 Colt against determined opponents such as the Moro juramentado warriors encountered in the Moro Rebellion. The then-current issue rifle, the [...]30-40 Krag, had also failed to stop Moro warriors effectively; the British had similar issues switching to the [...]303 British, which resulted {{in the development of the}} <b>dum-dum</b> <b>bullet.</b> This experience, and the Thompson-LaGarde Tests of 1904 led the Army and the Cavalry, to decide a minimum of [...]45 caliber was required in the new handgun. Thompson and Major Louis Anatole La Garde of the Medical Corps arranged tests on cadavers and animal remains in the Chicago stockyards, resulting in the finding that [...]45 was the most effective pistol cartridge. They noted, however, training was critical to make sure a soldier could score a hit in a vulnerable part of the body.|$|E
40|$|At {{one point}} in history, a soldier in combat would have been injured with a bow and arrow. That bow and arrow {{eventually}} became a bullet, and in the 1890 s, that bullet evolved into the ‘dum-dum bullet,’ designed to expand on impact and inflict severe injury. Because of its potential to gravely wound combatants, The Hague Convention of 1899 prohibited {{the use of the}} <b>dum-dum</b> <b>bullet</b> in international warfare. A century later, landmines, designed to maim and injure, rather than kill, were deemed indiscriminate weapons with potential to inflict serious injury. After a high-profile campaign waged by a coalition of non-governmental organizations, 162 countries signed the 1997 Ottawa Treaty pledging to stop their production and use. Today, a far more dangerous weapon in use on the battlefield – the improvised explosive device or IED – needs to join the ranks of prohibited weapons, according to an international research team led by Schulich School of Medicine 2 ̆ 6 Dentistry Surgery professors Shane Smith and Vivian McAlister. The group’s study of the weapon and its impact – Injury profile suffered by targets of antipersonnel improvised explosive devices: prospective cohort study – was published last month in the journal BMJ Open...|$|E
50|$|The battle went on {{for four}} hours before Knox belatedly showed up with his {{infantry}} force. At that point, one surviving officer, Major William Bernard Hickie, led the MI in a bayonet charge. This quickly produced a Boer surrender. The MI wanted to shoot two Boers who were found with <b>dum-dum</b> <b>bullets,</b> but Knox humanely stopped this. To the irritation of the MI officers, Knox and his staff seemed preoccupied with dividing the spoils in the captured Boer camp. There was no pursuit.|$|R
50|$|The Battle of the Severn, {{fought on}} Sunday, March 25, 1655, {{was the first}} battle ever fought between American {{soldiers}} on American soil. It was the first battle in which <b>dum-dum</b> <b>bullets</b> were used, bullets that have a hollow point, which expands more than usual upon hitting an object. The battle was the only battle in America in which {{the flag of the}} Commonwealth of England was flown. The battle was also the first in which the Provincial flag of Maryland was flown (colors of black and yellow). Among the Proprietary Forces numbering about 225, there were 17 killed and 32 wounded.|$|R
5000|$|Gnaghi and Dellamorte pack up the car, {{and head}} for the Buffalora city limits and the {{mountains}} beyond. Gnaghi's head is injured when Dellamorte slams on the brakes. They get out of the vehicle and walk {{to the edge of the}} road, where it drops into a chasm. Gnaghi begins to seize, and collapses to the ground. Dellamorte, realizing that the rest of the world doesn't exist and fearing that his assistant is dead or dying, loads a gun with two <b>dum-dum</b> <b>bullets</b> to finish them both off. Gnaghi wakes up and drops Dellamorte's gun off the cliff. He then asks to be taken home, speaking clearly. Dellamorte replies: [...] "Gna." ...|$|R
5000|$|The first atrocities {{were made}} by Ethiopian troops, who used to {{mutilate}} (often with castration) their prisoners: the Eritrean askari suffered from this treatment since the first weeks of war. After December the Ethiopians (in addition {{to the use of}} <b>Dum-Dum</b> <b>bullets</b> banned by the Hague Convention of 1899, Declaration III) started to do the same even to the Italians: the Italians retaliated with the use of poison gas. However, {{it is clear that the}} Italians intended to use poison gas well before the death of Tito Minniti since the gas bombs and cylinders had to be transported by ship through the Suez canal before the start of the war.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} UVF gunmen {{opened fire}} on the Miami Showband members who had been blown down into the field {{below the level of}} the road. Three of the band members were killed: trumpeter Brian McCoy, guitarist Tony Geraghty, and lead singer Fran O'Toole. Saxophone player Des McAlea and bassist Stephen Travers were both wounded, the latter having been shot with <b>dum-dum</b> <b>bullets.</b> Several days before the Showband attack, Mid-Ulster UVF leader Billy Hanna was shot dead, allegedly by Robin Jackson, who assumed command of the brigade. According to authors and journalists Martin Dillon, Paul Larkin and Joe Tiernan, Boyle had accompanied Jackson when the latter shot Hanna outside his home in Lurgan. Weir maintained that Jackson was an RUC Special Branch agent.|$|R
25|$|Criticisms {{extended}} to the supplies for the troops: British soldiers were sent out from England with boots made substantially from cardboard, which rapidly disintegrated {{and had to be}} bound with cloth or string to hold together. While the Indian Army was equipped with highly effective <b>Dum-dum</b> <b>bullets</b> produced in India, British bullets sent to Egypt were simply pointed, and 1,000,000 rounds had to have their ends filed off to increase their effectiveness. The rough remodelling meant the bullets were inaccurate at long ranges, giving soldiers a choice of bullets able to hit their target but only wound, or killing bullets which were likely to miss and could jam the guns. Railway engines needed to carry troops and supplies into Sudan had to be obtained {{from all over the world}} as British companies were unable to supply at short notice. By contrast, American companies could supply locomotives immediately which were more effective and cheaper than some obtained from England.|$|R
5000|$|The {{permission}} {{was given}} because the Ethiopians used <b>Dum-dum</b> <b>bullets</b> (the Hague Convention of 1899, Declaration III, prohibited the use in international warfare of bullets called [...] "Dum-dum", which easily expand or flatten in the body) against the Italians {{from the start}} of the war: this provoked the retaliation of the Italians, who used gas against the Ethiopians in the last months of the war. However, some historians (for example, Anthony Mockler) consider the effect of this gas weapon in battle negligible, like in the report written by the US Major Norman Fiske. [...] Major Fiske thought the Italians were clearly superior and that victory for them was assured no matter what. The use of chemical agents in the war was nothing more than an experiment. He concluded: [...] "From my own observations and from talking with Italian junior officers and soldiers I have concluded that gas was not used extensively in the African campaign and that its use had little if any effect on the outcome." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Methuen's {{statement}} differs, {{as will be}} seen, very widely from Mr. Stead's; for Mr. Stead says Mafeking, and Mr. Methuen says {{north of}} Mafeking. There was a very great deal of fighting at Mafeking, and comparatively little north of Mafeking during that time, so that the difference is an essential one. To test Mr. Stead's assertion about Mafeking, I communicated with General Baden-Powell, the gentleman who is most qualified to speak as to what occurred there, and his answer lies before me: 'We had no expanding bullets in our supply at Mafeking, unless you call the ordinary Martini-Henry an expanding bullet. I would not have used them on humane principles, and moreover, an Army order had been issued {{against the use of}} <b>dum-dum</b> <b>bullets</b> in this campaign. On the other hand, explosive bullets are expressly forbidden in the Convention, and these the Boers used freely against us in Mafeking, especially on May 12.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Here, again, {{it is very}} {{necessary}} to avoid confusing this soul of the savage with mere savagery {{in the sense of}} brutality or butchery; in which the Greeks, the French and all the most civilised nations have indulged in hours of abnormal panic or revenge. Accusations of cruelty are generally mutual. But it is the point about the Prussian that with him nothing is mutual. The definition of the true savage does not concern itself even with how much more he hurts strangers or captives than do the other tribes of men. The definition of the true savage is that he laughs when he hurts you; and howls when you hurt him. This extraordinary inequality in the mind is in every act and word that comes from Berlin. For instance, no man of the world believes all he sees in the newspapers; and no journalist believes a quarter of it. We should, therefore, be quite ready in the ordinary way to take a great deal off the tales of German atrocities; to doubt this story or deny that. But {{there is one thing that}} we cannot doubt or deny: the seal and authority of the Emperor. In the Imperial proclamation the fact that certain [...] "frightful" [...] things have been done is admitted; and justified on the ground of their frightfulness. It was a military necessity to terrify the peaceful populations with something that was not civilised, something that was hardly human. Very well. That is an intelligible policy: and in that sense an intelligible argument. An army endangered by foreigners may do the most frightful things. But then we turn the next page of the Kaiser's public diary, and we find him writing to the President of the United States, to complain that the English are using <b>dum-dum</b> <b>bullets</b> and violating various regulations of the Hague Conference. I pass for the present the question of whether there is a word of truth in these charges. I am content to gaze rapturously at the blinking eyes of the True, or Positive, Barbarian. I suppose he would be quite puzzled if we said that violating the Hague Conference was [...] "a military necessity" [...] to us; or that the rules of the Conference were only a scrap of paper. He would be quite pained if we said that <b>dum-dum</b> <b>bullets,</b> [...] "by their very frightfulness," [...] would be very useful to keep conquered Germans in order. Do what he will, he cannot get outside the idea that he, because he is he and not you, is free to break the law; and also to appeal to the law. It is said that the Prussian officers play at a game called Kriegsspiel, or the War Game. But in truth they could not play at any game; for the essence of every game is that the rules are the same on both sides.|$|R
5000|$|Robberies, {{murders and}} rapes {{were at their}} height 4.00 p.m. on 15 September. In the whole town massacres of the Armenian {{population}} and robberies of all non-Muslim peoples were going on. They broke the doors and windows, entered the living quarters, dragged out men, {{women and children and}} killed them in the street. From all the houses the yells {{of the people who were}} being attacked were heard....In some spots there were mountains of dead bodies, and many had terrible wounds from <b>dum-dum</b> <b>bullets.</b> The most appalling picture was at the entrance to the Treasury Lane from Surukhanskoi Street. The whole street was covered with dead bodies of children not older than nine or ten years. About eighty bodies carried wounds inflicted by swords or bayonets, and many had their throats cut; it was obvious that the wretched ones had been slaughtered like lambs. From Telephone Street we heard cries of women and children and we heard single shots. Rushing to their rescue I was obliged to drive the car over the bodies of dead children. The crushing of bones and strange noises of torn bodies followed. The horror of the wheels covered with the intestines of dead bodies could not be endured by the colonel and the asker (adjutant). They closed their eyes with their hands and lowered their heads. They were afraid to look at the terrible slaughter. Half mad from what he saw, the driver sought to leave the street, but was immediately confronted by another bloody hecatomb.|$|R
