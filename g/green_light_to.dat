5|$|Auerbach {{was then}} {{approached}} by Ben Kerner, {{owner of the}} Tri-Cities Blackhawks. After getting a <b>green</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> rebuild the team from scratch, Auerbach traded {{more than two dozen}} players in just six weeks, and the revamped Blackhawks improved, but ended the 1949–50 NBA season with a losing record of 28–29. When Kerner traded Auerbach's favorite player John Mahnken, an angry Auerbach resigned again.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, all the cars lined up on the grid per FIA race procedure. As Charlie Whiting signalled the <b>green</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> start the {{formation}} lap, a full field of twenty cars set off as normal for a single lap before forming the starting grid. At the banked Turn 13, the entrance to the pit lane (and the turn that was the centre of the controversy), all teams that ran Michelin tyres returned to their pits, leaving just six cars from the three Bridgestone teams (Ferrari, Jordan, and Minardi) to start the race.|$|E
2500|$|Metered freeways {{are also}} a {{solution}} for controlling rush hour traffic. In Phoenix, Arizona and Seattle, Washington, among other places, [...] metered on-ramps have been implemented. During rush hour, traffic signals are used with <b>green</b> <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> allow one car per blink of the <b>light</b> <b>to</b> proceed on to the freeway.|$|R
25|$|In early 2016, the Boston Transportation Department {{modified}} the D Street traffic <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> give more <b>green</b> <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> buses. However, unlike normal transit signal priority systems, the BTD's modifications only detect buses during {{some parts of}} the cycle and do not modify the total cycle length, leading to criticism from transportation planners that the solution was inadequate.|$|R

5|$|During the 2004–2005 pilot season, a {{pilot was}} {{announced}} named Untitled Tina Fey Project. The 30 Rock pilot {{focused on the}} boss of a variety show who must manage her relationships with the show's volatile star and its charismatic executive producer. The storyline evolved into one that dealt with a head writer of a variety show who dealt with both of the stars, {{as well as the}} show's new network executive. 30 Rock was officially given the <b>green</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> air May 15, 2006, along with a 13-episode order.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) {{acquired}} the land containing the spring {{for the expansion}} of the nearby Sembawang Air Base, leaving F with less than 4 hectares (10 acres) of land. Its water-bottling plant survived until the early 1990s however. In January 2002, locals' interest to the hot spring, which had caught the attention of Singaporeans after the surrounding land had been cleared to begin the RSAF air base extension. Sembawang community leaders gathered signatures to petition Mindef, which was going to fence off the area, to preserve and develop the hot spring for the general public. Mindef gave the <b>green</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> the appeals and opened a small side gate pavement for the public to access the spring.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, City Council Member Eric Ulrich, a Republican {{representing}} Ozone Park, {{came out}} against the plan as among other things, it prohibited left turns at Jamaica Avenue. He had been in favor of bus rapid transit along Woodhaven Boulevard, as he stated in a 2014 opinion editorial. The plan was modified in May 2016 {{in an effort to}} accommodate Ulrich's objections. It included restrictions on left-turns at only five intersections, including none at Jamaica Avenue. The left-turn restrictions were put into the plan to speed up travel times by eliminating the signal time allocated to split phasing—a traffic-signal setup where traffic in one direction has a green light, while the other directions of traffic have a red light, in order to allow drivers at the <b>green</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> turn left without conflicts from oncoming traffic. The restrictions also reduce conflicts between turning vehicles and pedestrians. Instead of banning left turns at Jamaica Avenue, the left turn bays would be re-engineered around the BMT Jamaica Line subway columns to decrease blind spots and collisions. Local community members were also opposed to the plan due to the reduction of traffic lanes along the boulevard's service roads from two lanes to a single lane.|$|E
50|$|With a focal {{height of}} 65 m above sea level, the main light {{can be seen}} for 15 {{nautical}} miles, and has a light characteristic of a flash of white light every two seconds.

5000|$|Crossing {{the avenue}} at street level often {{requires}} a few minutes, as all intersections have traffic lights. Under normal walking speed, it takes pedestrians normally two <b>to</b> three <b>green</b> <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> cross it. Some urban planners have submitted projects {{to move the}} central part of the avenue underground to alleviate the perceived [...] "chasm" [...] between the two sides of the avenue.|$|R

5000|$|This {{means that}} commuters {{are unable to}} cross the {{intersection}} in one signal cycle. [...] "It takes me at least three <b>green</b> <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> cross each signal of the BRT. Even during non-peak hours, I am stuck in a never-ending jam. Sometimes, I feel like banging my car in frustration. I can walk faster in this corridor," [...] says a much hassled Ratika Dang, an interior designer.|$|R

50|$|In some {{countries}} traffic signals {{will go into}} a flashing mode if the Conflict Monitor detects a problem, such as a fault that tries <b>to</b> display <b>green</b> <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> conflicting traffic. The signal may display flashing yellow to the main road and flashing red to the side road, or flashing red in all directions. Flashing operation {{can also be used}} during times of day when traffic is light, such as late at night.|$|R
25|$|In May 2016 ORR {{gave the}} <b>green</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> a new {{operator}} called East Coast Trains which would operate services to Edinburgh Waverley via Stevenage, Newcastle & Morpeth. The operation would begin operation in 2021.|$|E
25|$|On other occasions, the C-123s would load up {{troops from}} the South Vietnamese {{airborne}} brigade in Saigon to fly to the relief of a village that had come under attack. Over the village, the C-123 pilot would reduce power, drop flaps, and spiral down to the drop altitude and give the paratroopers a <b>green</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> jump.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, RFP {{competitions}} use paper {{targets that}} {{are able to}} turn 90 degrees to appear to the shooter and then turn back to disappear when the shooting time is up. During the last few decades, these targets have gradually been replaced by electronic devices which use red and <b>green</b> <b>lights</b> <b>to</b> indicate {{the beginning and the end}} of the shooting time, and which automatically handle late shots. As these systems are expensive, they are normally only used in international competitions.|$|R

25|$|After {{it became}} known that the {{government}} had given <b>green</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> construction works in the Karadere area, massive protests on 23 March 2014 were held in the cities of Sofia, Plovdiv and Varna; and a counter-protest in Byala. The protesters expressed their view that the few environmentally well-preserved areas in the country should not be turned into concrete landscapes. Allegations have surfaced that architect Georgiy Stanishev, brother of Sergei Stanishev, had been behind this project, but he has denied any involvement.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, Thomas {{returned}} from Europe determined {{to restore order}} in the Socialist Party.

50|$|Hyeon-Hye Kim {{demonstrated}} that the addition of 24% <b>green</b> <b>light</b> (500-600 nm) <b>to</b> red and blue LEDs enhanced the growth of lettuce plants. These RGB treated plants not only produced higher dry and wet weight and greater leaf area than plants grown under just red and blue LEDs, they also produced more than control plants grown under cool white fluorescent lamps, which are the typical standard for full spectrum light in plant research. She reported that the addition of <b>green</b> <b>light</b> also {{makes it easier to}} see if the plant is healthy since leaves appear green and normal. However, giving nearly all <b>green</b> <b>light</b> (86%) <b>to</b> lettuce produced lower yields than all the other groups.|$|R
