5|$|The Gore letter did spur some {{progress}} in negotiations, as the Soviet Union allowed in late November 1958 for explicit control measures {{to be included}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> <b>of</b> the drafted treaty. By March 1959, the negotiators had agreed upon seven treaty articles, but they primarily concerned uncontroversial issues {{and a number of}} disputes over verification persisted. First, the Soviet verification proposal was deemed by the West to be too reliant on self-inspection, with control posts primarily staffed by citizens of the country housing the posts and a minimal role for officials from the international supervisory body. The West insisted that half of a control post staff be drawn from another nuclear state and half from neutral parties. Second, the Soviet Union required that the international supervisory body, the Control Commission, require unanimity before acting; the West rejected the idea of giving Moscow a veto over the Commission's proceedings. Finally, the Soviet Union preferred temporary inspection teams drawn from citizens of the country under inspection, while the West insisted on permanent teams composed of inspectors from the Control Commission.|$|E
5|$|This passage {{has often}} been {{interpreted}} as {{a reference to the}} benign policy instituted by Cyrus of allowing exiled peoples, such as the Jews, to return to their original homelands. The Cylinder's inscription has been linked with the reproduction in the Book of Ezra of two texts that are claimed to be edicts issued by Cyrus concerning the repatriation of the Jews and the reconstruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. The two edicts (one in Hebrew and one in Aramaic) are substantially different in content and tone, leading some historians to argue that one or both may be a post hoc fabrication. The question of their authenticity remains unresolved, though it is widely believed that they do reflect some sort of Persian royal policy, albeit perhaps not one that was couched in the terms given <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> <b>of</b> the biblical edicts.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is intended to}} analyze <b>the</b> repetition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body <b>text</b> <b>of</b> shampoo advertisements. <b>The</b> objectives of this research are: first, to describe what types of repetitions are used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body <b>text</b> <b>of</b> shampoo advertisements. Second, {{to find out which}} repetition is most often used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body <b>text</b> <b>of</b> shampoo advertisements. Third, to find out why certain repetition is most often used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body <b>text</b> <b>of</b> shampoo advertisements. This is a qualitative research. Therefore, it uses descriptive method with the theories of repetition proposed by Halliday and Hasan (1976), Renkema (1993), Hoey (1991) and Halliday (1994), the theories of discourse proposed by Halliday (1985), Renkema (1993) and Nunan (1993), and the theories of advertisement proposed by Cook (1992) and Moi (1997). At the end of the analyses the writer found that <b>the</b> repetitions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body <b>text</b> <b>of</b> shampoo advertisements are classified into simple repetition and complex repetition. Simple repetition is the most dominant types of repetition that used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body <b>text</b> <b>of</b> shampoo advertisements because the use of simple repetition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body <b>text</b> <b>of</b> shampoo advertisements is very important to make the readers or consumers understand and remember the name of the products or brands and the USAge of products.
