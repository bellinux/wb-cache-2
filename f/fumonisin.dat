Households were selected at random in each district where 10 maize samples were collected for laboratory analysis. Aflatoxins and <b>fumonisins</b> were analyzed using a single step lateral flow immunochromatographic assay based on a competitive immunoassay format. The detection limit for aflatoxins was 2 μg/kg with a quantitation range of 2 – 150 μg/kg and that for <b>fumonisins</b> was 1 mg/kg with a quantitation range of 1 – 7 mg/kg.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to measure the effects of chronic exposure to <b>fumonisins</b> via the ingestion of feed containing naturally contaminated corn in growing pigs infected or not with Salmonella spp. This exposure to a moderate dietary concentration of <b>fumonisins</b> (11. 8 ppm) was sufficient to induce a biological effect in pigs (Sa/So ratio), but no mortality or pathology was observed over 63 days of exposure. No mortality or related clinical signs, even in cases of inoculation with Salmonella (5 × 104 CFU), were observed either. <b>Fumonisins,</b> at these concentrations, did not affect the ability of lymphocytes to proliferate in the presence of mitogens, but after seven days post-inoculation they led to inhibition of the ability of specific Salmonella lymphocytes to proliferate following exposure to a specific Salmonella antigen. However, the ingestion of <b>fumonisins</b> had no impact on Salmonella translocation or seroconversion in inoculated pigs. The inoculation of Salmonella did not affect faecal microbiota profiles, but exposure to moderate concentrations of <b>fumonisins</b> transiently affected the digestive microbiota balance.

40|$|<b>Fumonisins</b> are a {{group of}} polyketide-derived mycotoxins {{produced}} by Fusarium Verticillioides, a filamentous fungus infecting corn and contaminating food and feeds. <b>Fumonisins</b> contain two tricarballylic esters that are critical for toxicity. Here, we present genetic and biochemical data for the esterification mechanism. FUM 14 in F. Verticillioides has been deleted by homologous recombination, and the resultant mutant {{lost the ability to}} produce <b>fumonisins.</b> Two new metabolites, HFB 3 and HFB 4, which are biosynthetic precursors of <b>fumonisins</b> lacking the tricarballylic esters, were detected in the mutant. The results suggest that FUM 14 is required for the esterification of <b>fumonisins.</b> FUM 14 was predicted to encode a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) containing two domains, peptidyl carrier protein and condensation domain. Both the intact Fum 14 p and the condensation domain have been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified for activity assays. Fum 14 p was able to convert HFB 3 and HFB 4 to the tricarballylic esters-containing <b>fumonisins,</b> FB 3 and FB 4, respectively, when incubated with tricarballylic thioester of N-acetylcysteamine. In addition, the condensation domain was able to convert HFB 1 to FB 1. These data provide direct evidence for the role of Fum 14 p in the esterification of <b>fumonisins.</b> More interestingly, the results are the first example of an NRPS condensation domain catalyzing a C-O bond (ester) formation, instead of the typical C-N bond (amide) formation in nonribosomal peptides. The understanding of the esterification mechanism provides useful knowledge for mycotoxin reduction and elimination. The study also provides new insight into the reactions catalyzed by NRPS...|$|R

5000|$|Fumonisins: Fumonisins {{were first}} {{described}} and characterized in 1988. The most abundantly produced {{member of the}} family is <b>fumonisin</b> B1. They are thought to be synthesized by condensation of the amino acid alanine into an acetate-derived precursor. Fumonisins are produced by a number of Fusarium species, notably Fusarium verticillioides (formerly Fusarium moniliforme = Gibberella fujikuroi), Fusarium proliferatum, and Fusarium nygamai, as well as Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici. These fungi are taxonomically challenging, with a complex and rapidly changing nomenclature which has perplexed many nonmycologists (and some mycologists, too). The major species of economic importance is Fusarium verticillioides, which grows as a corn endophyte in both vegetative and reproductive tissues, often without causing disease symptoms in the plant. However, when weather conditions, insect damage, and the appropriate fungal and plant genotype are present, it can cause seedling blight, stalk rot, and ear rot. Fusarium verticillioides is present in virtually all corn samples. Most strains do not produce the toxin, so the presence of the fungus {{does not necessarily mean that}} <b>fumonisin</b> is also present. Although it is phytotoxic, <b>fumonisin</b> B1 is not required for plant pathogenesis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFumonisins are mycotoxins that {{naturally}} occur as contaminants in grains that are destined for animal and human consumption. These mycotoxins cause hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, immunotoxic, and neurotoxic effects in different intensities based on dose, time of exposure, and animal species. In the present study, male Wistar rats were fed between postnatal days 21 and 63 with diets that contained <b>fumonisins</b> B 1 +B 2 at concentrations of 1 and 3 mg/kg. The {{objective of the}} present study was to evaluate the effects of <b>fumonisins</b> on food intake, growth, weight gain, serum activity of the alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase enzymes, and quantitative and morphometric parameters of myenteric neurons in the jejunum that are immunoreactive to HuC/D protein and neuronal nitric oxide synthase enzyme (nNOS). Diets that contained <b>fumonisins</b> did not significantly alter food intake or body and blood parameters. We did not observe significant differences in the neuronal density and proportion of nitrergic neurons but found a significant reduction of cell body areas in both neuronal populations. This study is the first to report the effects of <b>fumonisins</b> in the enteric nervous system. The possible mechanisms by which <b>fumonisins</b> impair neuronal development and the use of the enteric nervous system as a tool for the study of the neurotoxic effects of <b>fumonisins</b> are discussed.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the dynamic profile of {{mycotoxin}} producing fungi and free and hidden <b>fumonisins</b> into raw maize collected in 28 fields and derived products.

Fusarium section Liseola included the prevalent fungi in maize kernels; sampling, in field at harvest and at the storehouse, gave comparable results, while a reduction in fungi colony forming units was noticed after drying, attributed to the thermal treatment. Similar amounts of free and hidden <b>fumonisins</b> were detected, irrespective of the sampling step; this confirmed {{the reliability of the}} sampling approach. During silo discharge, till to 10 month storage, a significant decrease resulted both in free and total <b>fumonisins.</b> A significant increase of the free-to-total <b>fumonisins</b> ratio was observed moving from stored kernels to commercial flour, suggesting that milling leads to a reduction of the masked fraction.
