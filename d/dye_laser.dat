This samarium laser emitted pulses of red light at 708.5nm. It had to be cooled by liquid helium and thus did not find practical applications.|$|E

25|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review of case reports and case series {{concluded that the}} limited available data suggest pulsed <b>dye</b> <b>laser</b> therapy is a safe and effective treatment for molluscum contagiosum and is generally well-tolerated by children. Side effects seen with pulsed <b>dye</b> <b>laser</b> therapy included mild temporary pain {{at the site of}} therapy, bruising (lasting up to 2–3 weeks), and temporary discoloration of the treated skin (as long as 1–6 months). No cases of permanent scarring have been reported. As of 2009, however, there is no evidence for genital lesions.|$|E

25|$|Fluorescein is a {{fluorophore}} {{commonly used}} in microscopy, in a type of <b>dye</b> <b>laser</b> as the gain medium, in forensics and serology to detect latent blood stains, and in dye tracing. Fluorescein has an absorption maximum at 494nm and emission maximum of 512nm (in water). The major derivatives are fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and, in oligonucleotide synthesis, 6-FAM phosphoramidite.|$|E
25|$|For {{most people}} in trials of pulsed <b>dye</b> <b>laser,</b> more than 25% of the redness was reduced by laser after one to three treatments. Adverse effects were rare in these trials, {{although}} some people had changes {{to the color of}} the skin, especially Chinese people with darker skin. There can be pain, crusting, and blistering in the two weeks after treatment. The trials only followed people for six months, so long-term outcomes are not known. Up to 10 treatments may be necessary for improvement, but complete removal may not result.|$|E

2500|$|In {{this method}} a laser is tuned to a {{wavelength}} which excites only one isotope {{of the material}} and ionizes those atoms preferentially. The resonant absorption of light for an isotope is dependent upon its mass and certain hyperfine interactions between electrons and the nucleus, allowing finely tuned lasers to interact with only one isotope. After the atom is ionized it can {{be removed from the}} sample by applying an electric field. This method is often abbreviated as AVLIS (atomic vapor laser isotope separation). This method has only recently been developed as laser technology has improved, and is currently not used extensively. However, it is a major concern to those in the field of nuclear proliferation because it may be cheaper and more easily hidden than other methods of isotope separation. [...] Tunable lasers used in AVLIS include the <b>dye</b> <b>laser</b> and more recently diode lasers.|$|E
