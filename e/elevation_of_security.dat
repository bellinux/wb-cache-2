The resultant STRIDE threat model (STRIDE is an acronym for Spoofing identity, Tampering with data, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial <b>of</b> service, <b>Elevation</b> <b>of</b> privilege) required <b>security</b> professionals to systematically determine how a potential attacker could utilize any threat categorized by the STRIDE acronym at each node of a Schneier-type attack tree.|$|R
40|$|The {{protection}} <b>of</b> <b>security</b> {{information in}} government departments requires the active engagement of executive management to assess emerging threats and provide strong security risk control measures. For most government departments, establishing effective protection <b>of</b> <b>security</b> information {{is a major}} initiative, given the often continuous, strategic nature <b>of</b> typical <b>security</b> efforts. This requires commitments or support from senior management and adequate resources. It necessitates the <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> information <b>security</b> management to positions of authority commensurate to the required responsibilities. This has been the trend {{in recent years as}} government departments are increasingly dependent on their information assets and resources, while threats and disruptions continue to escalate in frequency and cost. It is clear from numerous recent studies that organisations that have taken the steps described in this research document and have implemented effective information security risk control measures have achieved significant results in reduced losses and improved resource management. Given the demonstrable benefits, it is surprising that there have not been greater progress in effectively managing information assets. Although regulatory compliance has been a major driver in improving the protection <b>of</b> <b>security</b> information overall, this study has also shown that nearly half of all government departments are failing to initiate meaningful compliance efforts. Failure to address the identified vulnerabilities by government departments will result in espionage, covert influencing manipulation, fraud, sabotage and corruption. Information security risk control measures include the elements required to provide senior management assurance that its direction and intent are reflected in the <b>security</b> posture <b>of</b> the organisation by utilising a structured approach to implement an information security programme. Once those elements are in place, senior management can be confident that adequate and effective protection <b>of</b> <b>security</b> information will protect, as far as possible, the department’s vital information assets.

40|$|Web {{service is}} a {{distributed}} computing model constructed {{on the basis of}} open standard technology with the characteristics of loose coupling, language neutrality, platform-independence, etc., how to efficiently evaluate the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> Web {{service is a}} challenging research topic. Current researches concern more about the testing of Web service and rarely about the issue <b>of</b> service <b>security</b> evaluation. On the basis of analyzing the current Web services in terms <b>of</b> <b>security</b> threats, a Web service security evaluation method based on threat classification is proposed, which can process security evaluation to Web service from different angles of view, such as spoofing, tampering, repudiation, message disclosure, denial <b>of</b> service and <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> privilege, and can provide a referential evaluation index <b>of</b> Web service <b>security</b> for the users through the threat modeling and evaluating the degree <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> Finally, a case study on SOA application is discussed in detail, experimental results show that the proposed model works efficiently, it can provide valuable reference to check out <b>security</b> vulnerabilities <b>of</b> Web service and help to optimize the system’s security design. </span...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the clinical significance <b>of</b> late-onset abnormal <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> transaminase after hepatectomy. MethodsA retrospective {{analysis was performed}} on the clinical data of 15 patients with abnormal <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> transaminase after partial hepatectomy, who were admitted to our center from March 2009 to March 2012. The clinical implication of different types <b>of</b> late-onset <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> transaminase was analyzed. Comparison between groups was made by t test or chi-square test. ResultsThere were two different populations with abnormal <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> transaminase after operation. There were differences in time <b>of</b> postoperative transaminase <b>elevation,</b> duration <b>of</b> transaminase <b>elevation,</b> and peak level of transaminase between survival cases and death cases.
