The program proposed a unified approach to geometry that has become the accepted modern view.

500|$|A basic {{component}} of waveguide filters is the cavity resonator. [...] This {{consists of a}} short length of waveguide blocked at both ends. [...] Waves trapped inside the resonator are reflected {{back and forth between}} the two ends. [...] A <b>given</b> <b>geometry</b> of cavity will resonate at a characteristic frequency. [...] The resonance effect can be used to selectively pass certain frequencies. [...] Their use in a filter structure requires that some of the wave is allowed to pass out of one cavity into another through a coupling structure. [...] However, if the opening in the resonator is kept small then a valid design approach is to design the cavity as if it were completely closed and errors will be minimal. [...] A number of different coupling mechanisms are used in different classes of filter.|$|E
