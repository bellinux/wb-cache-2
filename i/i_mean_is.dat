What does Robert Christgau do in bed? <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>is</b> he a toe fucker? Man, anal retentive, A Consumer's Guide to Rock, what a moron: 'A Study' by, y'know, Robert Christgau. Nice little boxes: B-PLUS. Can you imagine working for a fucking year, {{and you get a}} B+ from some asshole in The Village Voice?" [...] Christgau rated the album C+ and wrote in his review, [...] "I thank Lou for pronouncing my name right." [...] In December 1980, Christgau provoked angry responses from Voice readers when his column approvingly quoted his wife Carola Dibbell's reaction to the murder of John Lennon: [...] "Why is it always Bobby Kennedy or John Lennon? Why isn't it Richard Nixon or Paul McCartney?" [...] Similar angst came from Sonic Youth in their song [...] "Kill Yr Idols" [...] (at the time known as [...] "I Killed Christgau with My Big Fucking Dick"), in which they sing [...] "I don't know why / You wanna impress Christgau / Ah let that shit die / And find out the new goal"; Christgau responded by saying [...] "Idolization is for rock stars, even rock stars manqué like these impotent bohos—critics just want a little respect. So if it's not too hypersensitive of me, I wasn't flattered to hear my name pronounced right, not on this particular title track." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, not soon; some day, perhaps, if {{all goes}} well. But <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to <b>be</b> back here often before that. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to <b>be</b> here in October, just for a little visit, if mamma can spare." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{may have}} been Philip, or Daniel, or Jeremiah, for {{anything}} I know. But the man <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>was</b> very much given to taking his liquor freely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I confess I've forgotten. Besides, she wasn't {{an actress}} then. What <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> that Biddy wasn't {{particularly}} pleased with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} were to call me Mary. What <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> this. Suppose that Silverbridge loves you better than all the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He--I mean--that is to say--what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>is,</b> {{he looked}} {{the sort of}} chap who might have a brother. Lots of those fellows have!" ...|$|E

60|$|Before {{attempting}} {{an explicit}} characterisation {{of the scientific}} and the mystical impulses, I will illustrate them by examples from two philosophers whose greatness lies in the very intimate blending which they achieved. The two philosophers <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>are</b> Heraclitus and Plato.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But, sir, you forget. Suppose {{the lady}} and gentleman <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>are</b> not the lady and gentleman you <b>mean?</b> It would <b>be</b> awkward {{to allow you}} to rush in upon them just now while they are at dinner, and might cause me to lose their future patronage.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{know what}} <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very anxious about this picture, and I shall be much {{disappointed}} if it cannot be done now. It was {{you put it}} into my head first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because they're {{independent}} and dignified and never quite cold, and their branches seem to brood, but chiefly because the ones <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>are</b> generally {{out of the}} common where you find them. You know--just one or two, strong and dark, standing out against the sky." ...|$|R
6000|$|COMTESSE. And {{my niece}} Lady Sybil Tenterden. [SYBIL'S head {{inclines}} on its stem.] She {{is not really}} all my niece; <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> only half of her aunt. What a triumph, Mr. Shand! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> asking, Hugh, asking. Haven't you any clew? Isn't there any voice in you, anywhere, deep down, that can tell me? {{give me a}} hint? just a little one?" ...|$|R

60|$|Thus you see of whom these pillars were a shadow, {{and what}} their height, their chapiters, their bowls, their nets, their chains, their pomegranates, and their lily work did signify, and how all was most sweetly {{answered}} in the antitype. These were men of the first rate; the apostles, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>were</b> such.|$|R
