5|$|The {{study of}} enzyme {{kinetics}} {{is important for}} two basic reasons. <b>Firstly,</b> it helps explain how enzymes work, and secondly, it helps predict how enzymes behave in living organisms. The kinetic constants defined above, KM and Vmax, are critical to attempts to understand how enzymes work together to control metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Two unusual {{events have}} been recorded. <b>Firstly,</b> in 1940 No.6221 Queen Elizabeth had its Caledonian blue colour scheme {{replaced}} by the crimson lake, the only such instance.
