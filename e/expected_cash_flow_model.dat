40|$|Under linear approximations for {{asset prices}} and the {{assumption}} of indepen-dence between expected consumption growth and time-varying volatility, long-run risks models imply constant market prices of risks and often generate counterfac-tual results about asset return and <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> predictability. We develop and esti-mate a nonlinear equilibrium asset pricing model with recursive preferences and a flexible econometric specification of <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> processes. While in many long-run risks models time-varying volatility influences only risk premium but not <b>expected</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> in our <b>model</b> {{a common set of}} risk factors drive both <b>expected</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and risk premium dynamics. This feature helps the model to overcome two main criticisms against long-run risk models following Bansal and Yaron (2004) : the over-predictability of <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> by asset {{prices and the}} tight relation between time-varying risk premia and growth volatility. Our model extends the approach in Le and Singleton (2010) to a setting with multiple <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> We estimate the model using the long-run historical data in the U. S. and find that the model with generalized market prices of risks produces <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and return predictability that are more consistent with the data.

40|$|In this thesis, {{share price}} {{movements}} are examined around {{the announcement of}} certain capitalisation changes. Previous Australian evidence in this area by Ball, Brown and Finn (1977) suggests that the equity market is efficient in both its timing (assessed using monthly data) and in its pricing of share splits, bonus and rights issues. That is, share prices adjust rapidly to reflect changes in <b>expected</b> future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> as <b>modelled</b> by changes in effective aggregate dividends paid to equity holders. This study extends Ball Brown and Finn (1977) by using daily data to examine not only share splits, bonus and rights issues but consolidations (reverse splits) as well. The two major findings are as follows: 1. the Australian equity market reacts quickly (normally within one trading day of the announcement) to incorporate unanticipated information regarding future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> conveyed by the abovementioned capitalisation announcements; and 2. that (assuming an efficient market) a signalling model based on year ahead changes in dividend policy alone does not capture all information priced by investors at the announcement date. This is so {{particularly in the case}} of equity issues (bonus and rights) where it is conjectured that Australian Stock Exchange Listing Rule requirements cause confounding, simultaneous firm-specific information to be released which is priced by investors...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the link between}} disclosure, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> uncertainty, and the option value of equity. Building upon Merton (1974), I model the equity of a levered firm as a call option whose equilibrium value is increasing in the variance of future <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> <b>Modeling</b> levered equity as an option allows for calculation of the firm’s vega, where vega measures the sensitivity of equity value to increases in <b>expected</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> variance. Using multiple measures of disclosure, I find that higher vega firms {{are more likely to}} issue disclosures that increase or sustain <b>expected</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> variance, consistent with firms promoting uncertainty when the marginal benefit is high. Specifically, I find that higher vega firms are associated with increases in option-implied volatilities in short-windows surrounding managerial guidance. Higher vega firms are also less likely to issue guidance but, when doing so, their earnings guidance is less specific and followed by increases in analyst forecast dispersion. Similarly, I find a negative relation between vega and a hand-collected index of voluntary disclosures. Finally, I demonstrate a positive relation between vega and absolute earnings surprises suggesting that higher vega firms are less likely to pre-empt earnings news. Taken together, the results are consistent with the option value of equity creating incentives for firms to raise uncertainty through disclosures...|$|R

40|$|The thesis investigates {{construction}} project <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> It {{is divided into}} two main components. The first investigates the cumulative gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> profiles (S curves), and the second examines the cumulative net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> profiles. The gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>model</b> can be used by either construction industry clients or contractors, whereas the net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>model</b> concerns the contractor. Interest in {{construction project}} <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> resulted from changed economic pressures in the 1970 s. A rise in inflation was associated with increased client attention to his gross <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> to the contractor, and similarly higher interest rates had the effect that contractors became concerned with their net <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> An examination of the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> literature found that most models were aimed at discovering generally applicable ideal curves. A similar situation existed within the net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> literature. It was argued that the averaging approach is unsuitable for construction project <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> research, and consequently an approach which concentrates on the individual project was pursued. A gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>model</b> was developed using logistic transformation regression procedures. This yielded excellent results for post-hoc analysis of individual project data. Furthermore the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>model</b> was found to be suitable for the generation of a construction project net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>model,</b> which was similarly oriented towards the post-hoc analysis of single projects. A measure of deviation was used which enabled the identification of projects for which the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>model</b> was a poor fit. This same procedure was used to exclude projects from the net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> analysis. The results from the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>model</b> analysis indicate that projects do vary considerably from one to another, and this supports the contention made that an individual approach to this research is necessary. The net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>model</b> yields an excellent trend line for net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> on a project, and thus provides an excellent means for senior management to judge the quality of management employed on a projectRestricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R

Section A details why the two-factor <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>model</b> captures the relation between risk premium and <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics in the simple economy discussed in the paper. Section B solves the risk premium on an asset using the usual return-based beta representation, reinforcing the intuition behind the two-factor <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>model</b> and also relating the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics directly to the standard return-based consumption beta. Section C examines a slightly modified simple economy where the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> of an asset is also exposed to long-run consumption risk and shows that the two-factor <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>model</b> is still valid. Section D shows that the empirical long-run earnings-based measures identify their theoretical counterparts up to scaling factors in the simple economy.
