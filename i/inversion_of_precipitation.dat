40|$|Temperature {{changes at}} the Earth surface {{propagate}} into the subsurface and leave a thermal signature in the underlying soil and rock. <b>Inversions</b> <b>of</b> subsurface temperature measurements yield reconstructions of ground surface temperature (GST) histories that provide estimates of climatic changes. A question remaining {{in the interpretation of}} reconstructed GST histories {{is the extent to which}} GST changes reflect changes principally in surface air temperature (SAT), or whether other factors may be significant. Here we use a Land Surface Processes (LSP) model to examine the influence <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> changes on GST and subsurface temperature and moisture fields on annual to decadal timescales. We model soil and vegetation conditions representative of a prairie region in the southern Great Plains of North America and force the model with meteorological data synthesized from a typical year in the region. Model responses are observed after changes in the amount <b>of</b> daily <b>precipitation,</b> the intensity and frequency <b>of</b> daily <b>precipitation,</b> and the diurnal and seasonal timing <b>of</b> <b>precipitation.</b> We show that: (1) increasing daily precipitation cools mean annual GST, (2) increasing the intensity and reducing the frequency <b>of</b> daily <b>precipitation,</b> while holding the annual amount <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> constant, cools mean annual GST, and (3) shifting maximum precipitation to occur in the warmest months cools mean annual GST. We compare modeled results to observed precipitation changes during the 20 th century and conclude that the observed precipitation changes would cause only small changes to GST within the modeled region, on the order of 0. 1 K or less...|$|R

30|$|Final {{experiment}} {{we performed}} was simultaneous <b>inversion</b> <b>of</b> Z and M, and Z and T (see Fig.  5 c, d). Note that Campanya et al.

Our inversion does not support this inference. Contrary, joint <b>inversion</b> <b>of</b> Z and M recovers true structures slightly worse than <b>inversion</b> <b>of</b> Z (cf. bottom plots of Fig.  1). Simultaneous <b>inversion</b> <b>of</b> Z and T likewise does not reveal the improvement in the recovery of true structures compared with individual <b>inversion</b> <b>of</b> Z.|$|R
