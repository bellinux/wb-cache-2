6000|$|... 1144. Purity of the zinc.--If pure zinc {{could be}} obtained, {{it would be}} very {{advantageous}} {{in the construction of the}} voltaic apparatus (998.). Most zincs, when put into dilute sulphuric acid, leave more or less of an <b>insoluble</b> <b>matter</b> upon the surface in the form of a crust, which contains various metals, as copper, lead, zinc, iron, cadmium, &c., in the metallic state. Such particles, by discharging part of the transferable power, render it, as to the whole battery, local; and so diminish the effect. As an indication connected with the more or less perfect action of the battery, I may mention that no gas ought to rise from the zinc plates. The more gas which is generated upon these surfaces, the greater is the local action and the less the transferable force. The investing crust is also inconvenient, by preventing the displacement and renewal of the charge upon the surface of the zinc. Such zinc as, dissolving in the cleanest manner in a dilute acid, dissolves also the slowest, is the best; zinc which contains much copper should especially be avoided. I have generally found rolled Liege or Mosselman's zinc the purest; and to the circumstance of having used such zinc in its construction attribute in part the advantage of the new battery (1134.).|$|E

40|$|A {{combination}} of NanoSIMS and High resolution {{transmission electron microscopy}} (HRTEM) imaging along with Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the carbonaceous phases in HF/HCl residue of the Abee enstatite chondrite. This acid residue hosts a very D-depleted component (δD = − 480 ‰). This residue {{is a mixture of}} graphite and highly disordered <b>insoluble</b> organic <b>matter.</b> The latter exhibits a significant mesoporosity (i. e., 200 – 500 nm scale), and also shows concentric and elongated stacks of polyaromatic layers. <b>Insoluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> is shown to be the most D-depleted component in Abee. We also determined, by using NanoSIMS, carbon isotopic composition of graphite and <b>insoluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> in the acid residue (δ^(13) C = − 11. 3 ± 2. 9 ‰ and − 28. 4 ± 2. 2 ‰, respectively). We identified graphite in metal-rich clasts and in the matrix of Abee, associated with enstatite, sulfide and metal, but we could not localize highly disordered organic matter in our section. Regardless, given the vulnerability of organic matter to thermal degradation, we suggest that it was added to Abee parent body during the latest stage of its formation, after any thermal metamorphism or partial melting of Abee parent body. A genetic link between organic matter and graphite in Abee is excluded based on our HRTEM and carbon isotopic data. The differences in carbon isotopic compositions between these phases are consistent with previous data obtained by stepwise heating experiments and indicate that graphite is not derived from a pure thermal solid-state graphitization of the organic matter. Rather, we suggest that graphite precipitated from a melt rich in C during the partial melting of the Abee parent body. <b>Insoluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> in Abee has the lowest D/H ratio among the extraterrestrial organics. Organics in most carbonaceous and ordinary chondrites are believed to have been subjected to irradiations in low temperature environments, resulting in a dramatic isotopic fractionation through exchange and reaction with gaseous molecular hydrogen during their synthesis. In contrast, Abee organic matter was likely synthesized in a neutral (i. e., not ionized) environment where thermodynamic processes at equilibrium most likely controlled its isotopic composition. This organic matter could have been accreted in a minor component of Abee like the dark inclusions without (or prior to) exposure to the radiation responsible for D enrichments in other meteoritic organics. During the last brecciation events that have affected the Abee parent body, these inclusions could have been mixed with other Abee components. The properties of this organic matter can be interpreted as an indication that thermodynamic processes acted in the synthesis of organic matter in the protosolar disk, in addition to ion/molecule and gas/grains reaction witnessed by the D-rich <b>insoluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> contained in carbonaceous chondrites...|$|R

50|$|When the {{nitric acid}} {{concentration}} is high the extraction into the organic phase is favoured, {{and when the}} nitric acid concentration is low the extraction is reversed (the organic phase is stripped of the metal). It is normal to dissolve the used fuel in nitric acid, after {{the removal of the}} <b>insoluble</b> <b>matter</b> the uranium and plutonium are extracted from the highly active liquor. It is normal to then back extract the loaded organic phase to create a medium active liquor which contains mostly uranium and plutonium with only small traces of fission products. This medium active aqueous mixture is then extracted again by tributyl phosphate/hydrocarbon to form a new organic phase, the metal bearing organic phase is then stripped of the metals to form an aqueous mixture of only uranium and plutonium. The two stages of extraction are used to improve the purity of the actinide product, the organic phase used for the first extraction will suffer a far greater dose of radiation. The radiation can degrade the tributyl phosphate into dibutyl hydrogen phosphate. The dibutyl hydrogen phosphate can act as an extraction agent for both the actinides and other metals such as ruthenium. The dibutyl hydrogen phosphate can make the system behave in a more complex manner as it tends to extract metals by an ion exchange mechanism (extraction favoured by low acid concentration), to reduce the effect of the dibutyl hydrogen phosphate it is common for the used organic phase to be washed with sodium carbonate solution to remove the acidic degradation products of the tributyl phosphate.|$|E

The polyaromatic layers, shorter than 1 nm in petrologic type = 3. 0 chondrites, grow up to sizes between 5 and 10 nm in petrologic type > 3. 6 chondrites, contributing to the increase of the degree of structural order.

The limited degree of organization of the most metamorphosed IOMs compared with terrestrial rocks submitted to similar temperature suggests that the conditions are not favorable to graphitization processes, due to the chemical nature of the precursor or the lack of confinement pressure...|$|R
