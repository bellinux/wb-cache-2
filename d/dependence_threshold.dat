40|$|Abstract — Two new supply-independent bias circuits, {{which take}} {{advantage}} of the temperature dependence of NMOS and PMOS threshold voltages to form a CMOS voltage reference, are presented. Due to the circuit architecture the mobility factor is completely cancelled. They do not use resistors and all transistors works in strong inversion. The circuit is simple, opamp-less and can be implemented in a standard CMOS process. The supply voltage sensitivity is 6 mV/V from a 3 V supply and the PSRR without any filtering capacitor at 1 KHz are- 65 dB for the PMOS circuit and- 41 dB for the NMOS circuit.

40|$|Properties {{of normal}} galactic star formation, {{including}} the density <b>dependence,</b> <b>threshold</b> density, turbulent scaling relations, and clustering properties, {{are applied to}} the formation of galactic bulges. One important difference is that the bulge potential well is too deep to have allowed self-regulation or blow-out by the pressures from young stars, unlike galactic disks or dwarf galaxies. As a result, bulge formation should have been at the maximum rate, which is such that most of the gas would get converted into stars in only a few dynamical time scales, or ~ 10 ^ 8 years. The gas accretion phase can be longer than this, but once the critical density is reached, which depends primarily on the total virial density from dark matter, the formation of stars in the bulge should have been extremely rapid. Such three-dimensional star formation should also have formed many clusters, like normal disk star formation today. Some of these clusters may have survived as old globulars, but most got dispersed, although they might still be observable as concentrated streams in phase space.

40|$|Tetanic {{stimulation}} of axons terminating in the CA 1 {{region of the}} hippocampus induces oscillations in the gamma-to-beta frequency band (13 – 100 Hz) and can induce long-term potentiation (LTP). The rapid pyramidal cell discharge is driven by a mainly GABAA-receptor-mediated slow depolarization and entrained mainly through ephaptic interactions. This study tests whether cellular compartmentalization can explain how cells, despite severely reduced input resistance, can still fire briskly and have IPSPs superimposed on the slow GABAergic depolarization, and whether this behaviour occurs in vivo. Oscillations induced in CA 1 in vitro by tetanic {{stimulation of}} the stratum radiatum or oriens were analysed using intracellular and multichannel field potentials along the cell axis. Layer-specific effects of focal application of bicuculline indicate that the GABAergic depolarization is concentrated on tetanized dendrites. Current-source density analysis and characteristics of partial spikes indicate that early action potentials are initiated in the proximal nontetanized dendrite but cannot invade the tetanized dendrite, where recurrent EPSPs and evoked IPSPs were largely suppressed. As the oscillation progresses, IPSPs recover and slow the neuronal firing to β frequencies, with a small subpopulation of neurons continuing to fire at γ frequency. Carbonic anhydrase <b>dependence,</b> <b>threshold</b> intensity, frequency, field strength and spike initiation/propagation of tetanus-evoked oscillations in urethane-anaesthetized rats, validate our observations in vitro, and show that these mechanisms operate in healthy tissue. However, the disrupted electrophysiology of the tetanized dendrites will disable normal information processing, has implications for LTP induction {{and is likely to}} play a role in pathological synchronization as found during epileptic discharges...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{temperature}} <b>dependence</b> of <b>threshold</b> current in self-assembled quantum dot lasers {{focusing on the}} factors that produce an increase of threshold current at high temperatures. Nonradiative recombination makes {{up the majority of}} threshold current and the temperature <b>dependence</b> of <b>threshold</b> current at higher temperatures. We measure radiative efficiencies at low current density for an undoped structure of 18 % and 9 % at 300 and 360 K, respectively. These values decrease at higher currents and are even lower for p-doped structures. In undoped structures, the incomplete population of the ground state due to the thermal distribution of holes limits the gain, and this is exacerbated at higher temperatures. In p-doped structures, the gain is increased, but the degree of improvement over an undoped sample is reduced at elevated temperatures. The increasing nonradiative current density at high temperatures is a result of both driving the device harder to maintain the threshold gain requirement (~ 50 % of the increase for an uncoated, 2 -mm long laser) and due to an increase in nonradiative recombination at fixed injection. The latter is similar in both p-doped and undoped structures with the most likely origin being the population of higher lying dot and wetting layer states...|$|R
