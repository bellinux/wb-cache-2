Pseudo-forces exerted on the end-effector and limbs of the mobile manipulator must be distributed {{over the entire}} structure. Pseudo-joint damping provides a mechanism for this process. <b>Damping</b> <b>functions</b> were used to create motion of the end-effector which emulated the characteristics of biological systems. The target biological characteristics were a general bell-shaped curve of the end-effector speed profile, an initial and final end-effector speed of zero, and a scaling of the speed profile with distance to goal. The <b>damping</b> <b>functions</b> were then evaluated for time, distance, safety, and flexibility {{to determine if the}} biological characteristics corresponded to improved performance of the mobile manipulator. The simulations showed that by reproducing the characteristics of biological systems, improved performance of the mobile manipulator was realized. The set of linear and square <b>damping</b> <b>functions</b> were found to perform best in a series of varying environments. Both <b>damping</b> <b>functions</b> were shown to produce different ending configurations of the arm, and to be more or less aggressive by varying the damping parameters in the functions.

40|$|Strictly {{ab initio}} {{calculations}} of the dispersion energy are unfeasible in practice {{but for the}} smallest systems. A sensible alternative is to model the dispersion contribution through a damped multipolar expansion. This thesis proposes to represent the dispersion energy {{by means of a}} non-empirical, atom-atom model using <b>damping</b> <b>functions</b> scaled from 'exact' results for one electron-one electron systems. We start by investigating the scalability of ab initio calculated <b>damping</b> <b>functions</b> for closed-shell atom-atom dimers. Ab initio scaling parameters are employed to assess the quality of the <b>damping</b> <b>functions</b> yielded by a predictor scheme based on the charge overlap between the interacting monomers. The investigation of the scaling properties is extended to atom-linear molecule systems, focusing on the dependence on orientation of the short-range dispersion energy and how to account for it using isotropic damping parameters. We study the possibilities of an 'atomic' (multicentre) representation of the dispersion energy, in contrast to the conventional 'molecular' (single-centre) picture, devising a well-defined method to obtain 'atomic' dispersion coefficients from the computed molecular ones, as well as 'atomic' damping parameters. In all the studied cases, the 'atomic' approach describes more adequately the anisotropy of the interaction, through a localisation process of the charge overlap effects. The CO sub 2 /CO case, in particular, encourages to believe in the transferability of 'atomic' dispersion coefficients and damping parameters, which being confirmed by further work, the present results can be regarded as the basis of an universal and affordable model to estimate the dispersion contribution in intermolecular potentials...|$|R

40|$|Massive spectroscopic {{redshift}} surveys open {{a promising}} window to accurately measure peculiar velocity at cosmological distances through redshift space distortion (RSD). In Paper I Zhang et al. [Phys. Rev. D 87, 063526 (2013) ] {{of this series}} of work, we proposed decomposing peculiar velocity into three eigenmodes (v(delta), v(S), and v(B)) {{in order to facilitate}} the RSD modeling and peculiar velocity reconstruction. In the current paper we measure the dark matter RSD-related statistics of the velocity eigenmodes through a set of N-body simulations. These statistics include the velocity power spectra, correlation functions, one-point probability distribution functions, cumulants, and the <b>damping</b> <b>functions</b> describing the Finger of God effect. We have carried out a number of tests to quantify possible numerical artifacts in these measurements and have confirmed that these numerical artifacts are under control. Our major findings are as follows: (1) The power spectrum measurement shows that these velocity components have distinctly different spatial distribution and redshift evolution, consistent with predictions in Paper I. In particular, we measure the window function (W) over tilde (k, z). (W) over tilde describes the impact of nonlinear evolution on the v(delta) -density relation. We confirm that the approximation (W) over tilde = 1 can induce a significant systematic error of O(10 %) in RSD cosmology. We demonstrate that (W) over tilde can be accurately described by a simple fitting formula with one or two free parameters. (2) The correlation function measurement shows that the correlation length is O(100), O(10), and O(1) Mpc for v(delta), v(S), and v(B), respectively. These correlation lengths determine where we can treat the velocity fields as spatially uncorrelated. Hence, they are important properties in RSD modeling. (3) The velocity probability distribution functions and cumulants quantify non-Gaussianities of the velocity fields. We confirm speculation in Paper I that v(delta) is largely Gaussian, but with non-negligible non-Gaussianity. We confirm that v(B) is significantly non-Gaussian. We also measure the <b>damping</b> <b>functions.</b> Despite the observed non-Gaussianities, the <b>damping</b> <b>functions</b> and hence the Finger of God effect are all well approximated as Gaussian ones at scales of interest...|$|R
