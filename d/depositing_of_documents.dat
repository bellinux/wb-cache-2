40|$|Institutional {{repositories}} {{have been}} the focus of much attention by universities and university libraries these last years. Institutional repositories are inserted in the usually denominated Open Access Initiative movement: This movement aims to promote free and unrestricted access to scientific and scholarly literature, favouring the increase of impact of the work done by researchers and institutions, contributing to reform the system of scientific communication, reassuming academia’s control over publication, increasing competition and reducing the monopoly by the editors of commercial journals. In this context, Universidade do Minho's Documentation Services have set the creation of an institutional repository – RepositóriUM - as a strategic goal for 2003, in order to archive, preserve and disseminate the intellectual production of all of the scientific communities in this University. This paper describes the way in which RepositóriUM was implemented in the Dspace platform, the system’s functionalities, the strategy for dissemination within the Universities’ communities, the process <b>of</b> self-archive or <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> and the application of the Dublin-Core metadata schema to the description <b>of</b> the <b>deposited</b> <b>documents.</b> Finally, results obtained and lessons learned during this first year of the project are presented, as well as the main lines of course to be followed in developing RepositóriUM...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the underlying fairness of applying equitable security presumptions to the <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> title <b>documents</b> belonging to third parties.

The fact that the parties to a loan advance may have intended to create a mortgage between themselves {{does not mean that the}} third party owner <b>of</b> the title <b>documents</b> also intended to create a mortgage.

40|$|The article {{presents}} analysis of national bibliographic control in Lithuania, {{which is based}} on the concept for the national bibliography developed by UNESCO and IFLA. It focuses on entities that comprise bibliographic control: resources (human resources, funds, hardware, software, etc.), legislation, standards, the National Bibliographic Data Bank, and products of the national bibliography. The scope of the article is narrowed to recent achievements in the development of these entities. The first of the entities of bibliographic control, i. e. resources disposed by the Martynas Mažvydas National Library of Lithuania for the implementation of its main functions, have recently ceased to be sufficient. Considering the rate of technology obsolescence and changing requirements for national bibliographic records and their access (standards), it becomes necessary to secure funds for the development of hardware and software. When evaluating the legislation the author admits that it has not been satisfactory for carrying out bibliographic control of some types <b>of</b> <b>documents.</b> Resolution No. 330 of 10 April 1997 of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania “On the Partial Amendment of Resolution No. 1389 of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania of 22 November 1996 ‘On the Order of Delivery <b>of</b> Legal <b>Deposit</b> <b>of</b> Printed Matters and Other Documents to Libraries’” lacks a more detailed clarification of e-resources, publishers’ responsibilities and copyright protection. As a result, publishers do not willingly conclude contracts with the Martynas Mažvydas National Library of Lithuania. The new Legal Deposit Law should: a) cover and anticipate new information media including web resources, the acquisition of which has not been sufficiently explained in the above mentioned Government Resolution; b) {{serve as the basis for}} formulating a national strategy for legal <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> document; c) identify and specify the types <b>of</b> legal <b>deposit</b> <b>documents,</b> number <b>of</b> copies and recipients; d) determine the order <b>of</b> <b>document</b> delivery, terms <b>of</b> delivery and the staff responsible; e) justify the legal delivery <b>of</b> <b>documents,</b> protection <b>of</b> copyright and access to <b>documents.</b> The preparation <b>of</b> Legal <b>Deposit</b> Law would solve some issues related to the acquisition and delivery <b>of</b> legal <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> in different media and would provide the inclusion of new technologies and new information media into the scope <b>of</b> legal <b>deposit.</b> The necessity for the law is obvious for several reasons; first of all, such legal document should indicate the relation between memory institutions and other products of intellectual property and their owners and also determine the principles of legal protection <b>of</b> national legal <b>deposit</b> <b>documents.</b> The article describes the linguistic supply of bibliographic control, i. e. introduces the ISO and IFLA <b>documents.</b> The dynamics <b>of</b> the development of the National Bibliography Data Bank and new subsystems that allowed expanding the scope of bibliographic control is also highlighted. The products of bibliographic control are reviewed with the focus on the possibilities that opened up for their preparation after the LIBIS publishing module had been set up.

40|$|Amazonia {{contains}} {{one of the}} world's richest biotas, but {{origins of}} this diversity remain obscure. Onset of the Amazon River drainage at approximately 10. 5 Ma represented {{a major shift in}} Neotropical ecosystems, and proto-Amazonian biotas just prior to this pivotal episode are integral to understanding origins of Amazonian biodiversity, yet vertebrate fossil evidence is extraordinarily rare. Two new species-rich bonebeds from late Middle Miocene proto-Amazonian <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> northeastern Peru <b>document</b> the same hyper-diverse assemblage of seven co-occurring crocodylian species. Besides the large-bodied Purussaurus and Mourasuchus, all other crocodylians are new taxa, including a stem caiman-Gnatusuchus pebasensis-bearing a massive shovel-shaped mandible, procumbent anterior and globular posterior teeth, and a mammal-like diastema. This unusual species is an extreme exemplar of a radiation of small caimans with crushing dentitions recording peculiar feeding strategies correlated with a peak in proto-Amazonian molluscan diversity and abundance. These faunas evolved within dysoxic marshes and swamps of the long-lived Pebas Mega-Wetland System and declined with inception of the transcontinental Amazon drainage, favouring diversification of longirostrine crocodylians and more modern generalist-feeding caimans. The rise and demise of distinctive, highly productive aquatic ecosystems substantially influenced evolution of Amazonian biodiversity hotspots of crocodylians and other organisms throughout the Neogene...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine if library and archive will meet professionally in {{digitization}} projects. The study has been conducted as a discourse analysis in accordance with the methods of Norman Fairclough, professor of Linguistics at Lancaster University. The texts are seen as linguistic and semiotic elements of social events that can be analyzed as parts of the social process – discourse. The relationship between events and structures in society will be part of the social practice. The basic data derive from five public documents collected from Swedish government agencies. The mutual subject is developing a national strategy for digitization and to contribute to the European digital library, Europeana, funded by the European Commission. The research question is: When digitizing the Swedish cultural heritage as a project of institutional cooperation, which discourses can be identified? Which will be regarded as a matter of course and which will be excluded?The conclusion is that the profession of library were the most frequent discourse in the analyzed texts. Another important factor is whether the information is born digital or if it is physical artifacts that has been digitized. The Swedish National Archives have stated detailed regulations of creating and transferring official documents as electronic records which differ from the National library proposed regulation for legal <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> electronic <b>documents.</b> For the library profession, the focus is on classification, searching and access. For the archive, the focus is to secure that the records has not been modified or corrupted for sustainable authenticity over time. In the social practice it can be established that the public institutions – libraries, museums, archives – will meet concurrence on the Internet from new entrepreneurs like Google, Genline and Creative Commons...|$|R

40|$|Scientific {{knowledge}} {{evolution is}} mainly {{based on an}} effective dissemination of research results. The concept of Open Access gives us the theoretical foundation of a model for accessing scientific knowledge, free from the constraints of traditional publishing and technologically supported by the Internet. Institutional Repositories are information systems that allow preserving, storing and disseminating scientific knowledge produced in higher education and scientific research institutions. They increase the visibility and the citation level <b>of</b> the <b>documents.</b> They also contribute to minimizing negative aspects like plagiarism <b>of</b> content because <b>documents</b> are exposed to peers in real time. As an alternative way to the traditional system of publishing scientific research content, repositories are developed in a cultural climate of great visibility leading to an immediate critical evaluation by peers. The Scientific Repository of the Polytechnic Institute of Castelo Branco – Portugal (RCIPCB) was created in 2009 but its official presentation took place in January 2010. Its main purposes are promoting Open Access (OA), and preserving and disseminating the scientific knowledge produced at the Polytechnic Institute of Castelo Branco (IPCB). Using DSpace as a technological platform, RCIPCB is an institutional project supported {{by the president of}} the IPCB. Therefore, the present study was developed with the aim of analyzing the performance of RCIPCB considering the evolution and growth in terms of users, archiving and self-archiving, the number <b>of</b> published <b>documents</b> (scientific) versus deposited documents in 2010 and the heterogeneity among communities/collections and its causes. Data were collected in RCIPCB, in the 2010 scientific publication list of the institute and through a questionnaire survey distributed among the members of the community with most <b>documents</b> <b>deposited</b> and those <b>of</b> the community with the fewest documents. For data collected in RCIPCB and in the publication list, average, standard deviation and counts were calculated. Data collected from questionnaires were analyzed with SPSS. The results show that RCIPCB indicates an asymmetric growing dynamics. Nevertheless, it reflects the institutional organization, in the sense that the communities related to the older schools possess more documents than the communities related to more recent schools. Communities having higher numbers <b>of</b> <b>deposited</b> <b>documents</b> seem to have also higher levels of searches and downloads. Therefore, it increases significantly the visibility of the institution and its researchers. Concerning the 2010 scientific production when compared with the <b>deposit</b> level <b>of</b> the corresponding community, the results show that the number <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> <b>deposited</b> is much lower than the number <b>of</b> published <b>documents.</b> Data obtained from the questionnaire answers from the communities The School of Agriculture (ESACB) and The School of Applied Arts (ESART) suggest that the strategy of communication used by RCIPCB is correct because everybody knows about the Repository. However, that is not related to the number <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> <b>deposited.</b> They also suggest that the strategy is not efficient and it needs some improvements in order to become effective. Considering the results it is clear that RCIPCB needs to have a mandatory depositing policy that might also be extended to user registration. Those factors would minimize both the heterogeneity and the asymmetric growth of communities and collections. Moreover, it would also decrease the difference between scientific production and the corresponding deposit in RCIPCB. </p...|$|R
