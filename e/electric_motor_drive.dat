5000|$|... 1959: Nikon F (Japan): first pro caliber 35 mm system SLR, first <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> {{accessory}} for SLR. (The Japanese Nikon SP 35 mm rangefinder camera had {{the first}} <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> for any camera type in 1957.) Well-integrated, durable and reliable focal-plane shutter, instant return mirror, pentaprism and auto-diaphragm design with excellent interchangeable lenses and huge accessory system. Although the F was not technologically ground-breaking, it sold 862,600 units and made the 35 mm SLR the dominant professional miniature format camera (displacing the 35 mm RF) by the early 1960s. The perfection of the optical and mechanical formulae of the interchangeable lens SLR in the one-two punch of the Hasselblad 500C (see above) and Nikon F also ended {{the popularity of the}} medium format twin-lens reflex (TLR) camera (typified by the Franke & Heidecke Rolleiflex/Rolleicord series later West Germany) by the early 1960s. The F's improved successor, the Nikon F2 (Japan) of 1971, is widely regarded as the finest mechanically controlled 35 mm SLR camera ever made.|$|E

50|$|They first {{appeared}} in the 1900s, when they were actuated either mechanically or pneumatically. In 1908, Alfredo Barrachini in Rome added electric lights inside the arms that turned on as they extended, but operation was still by a cable system. Electric operation came in 1918 when the Naillik Motor Signal Company of Boston added <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> <b>drive.</b> This system was superseded by two French inventors, Gustave Deneef and Maurice Boisson, who used a linear solenoid in 1923.

50|$|Over {{the ensuing}} decades, P&H earth moving {{machines}} evolved into larger, {{more powerful and}} more productive prime movers of material. By 1930, welding technology made possible the fabrication of lighter, stronger machinery versus traditional riveted-design machinery. P&H not only was an early adapter to welded design, but the firm also designed and manufactured its own line of electric arc welding machinery and welding rod products. Another technology advance applied to P&H digging machines during the 1930s was the Ward-Leonard DC <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> system. Pawling & Harnischfeger began designing and making their own electric motors and controls starting in 1893 when they acquired assets of the Gibb Electric Company that were not needed when Gibb was purchased by Westinghouse Electric Manufacturing Company.|$|E

In 1970, the Minolta SRM (Japan) {{was the first}} SLR {{with built-in}} electric sequential motor drive and first SLR with auto film-rewind. It was a modified Minolta SRT101 with a permanently bottom-mounted motor drive (eight AA LR6 batteries) and detachable handgrip for continuous three frames per second sequence shooting, but no light meter. Built-in motor drives did not become common in 35 mm SLRs until the mid-1980s when high-powered, energy efficient [...] "coreless" [...] micro-motors were perfected, but accessory drives or autowinders taking four to twelve AA (LR6) batteries were very popular in the 1970s.

50|$|The second {{generation}} K5 models incorporated the rear hatch glass and tailgate {{into a single}} unit, which allowed the glass panel to retract inside of the tailgate by use of a manual crank mounted on the tailgate or an electric motor activated by a key-operated switch on the tailgate and a dash-mounted switch. The weight of the large glass panel was rumored to be a liability as the manual crank gears wore prematurely and the electric motor was prone to frequent overheating and subsequent failure. This also included the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> cable which goes to the window regulator to the motor (similar in design to a speedometer cable), which usually would fail under heavy abuse. Another feature of the K5 Blazer tailgate was the safety switch connected to the electric motor which prevented the rear window from being raised if the tailgate was unlatched.|$|E

The spindle system is conceived to be easily retrofitted into conventional milling machines. The need for the hydraulic spindle arises because of the limitations placed on conventional <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> <b>driven</b> spindles by the low cutting power and the presence of vibrational phenomena associated with voltage frequency at high rotational speeds. Also, the <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> are usually large and expensive when power requirements are moderately high.

40|$|Implementation of {{redundant}} {{unit for}} motor drive control based on programmable logic devices is discussed. Continuous redundancy method is used. As compared to segregated standby redundancy and whole system standby redundancy, such method provides preservation of all unit functions {{in case of}} redundancy and gives the possibility for continuous monitoring of major and redundant elements. Example of that unit is given. <b>Electric</b> <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> control channel block diagram contains two control units – the major and redundant; it also contains four power supply units. Control units programming was carried out using automata-based approach. <b>Electric</b> <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> control channel model was developed; it provides complex simulation of control state-machine and power converter. Through visibility and hierarchy of finite state machines debug time was shortened as compared to traditional programming. Control state-machine description using hardware description language is required for its synthesis with FPGA-devices vendor design software. This description was generated automatically by MATLAB software package. To verify results two prototype control units, two prototype power supply units, and device mock-up were developed and manufactured. Units were installed in the device mock-up. Prototype units were created in accordance with requirements claimed to deliverable hardware. Control channel simulation and tests results in the perfect state and during imitation of major element fault are presented.
