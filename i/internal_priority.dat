The results {{at the level of}} entire sectors suggest that the lack of information about energy consumption patterns and about energy efficiency measures, lack of staff time, priority setting within organizations, and - in particular - the investor/user dilemma are all relevant barriers. Allowing for sector-specific differences in the relevance of these individual barriers yields a more heterogeneous picture. The numbers and types of relevant barriers vary across sub-sectors, and the majority of sub-sectors are subject to relatively few barriers. The statistically most significant barriers are found for the sub-sector of public administrations. These findings are robust, independent of whether the definition of an organization's energy efficiency performance includes only measures that have actually been realized or also those that are being planned.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new class of}} matching problems that mimics the tuition exchange programs employed by colleges in the US to enable the dependents of their eligible faculty to use their tuition benefits at other participating institutions. Each participating college has to maintain a balance between exported and imported students; a negative balance with exports exceeding imports is generally penalized by suspension from the program. On the other hand, these programs function through decentralized markets that make it difficult to sustain a balance. We show that any unbalanced market equilibrium respecting stability causes a race to the bottom by discouraging negative–balance colleges from exchange. To correct this failure, we propose a new centralized mechanism, two–sided top trading cycles (2 S-TTC), a variant of the well–known TTC mechanism. This is the first time a one–sided matching mechanism has been modified for a two–sided market. This mechanism selects a balanced–efficient matching that cannot be manipulated by students and it respects <b>internal</b> <b>priority</b> bylaws of colleges regarding dependent eligibility. Moreover, it makes full participation a dominant strategy for colleges, thus encouraging exchange. We also show that 2 S-TTC is the unique optimal mechanism fulfilling these objectives.

"Foundation Communications Today" updates our 2008 "State of the Practice Survey. " Once again, we asked professionals who hold communications jobs in foundations to tell us "how {{and what are you}} doing?" Through our online questionnaire, we probed to learn how foundation communicators perceive their roles and whether they feel they are central to the work of their organizations. We asked questions about how they spend their time, size of budgets, what is working and the challenges they face. We also wanted to know how quickly they are adopting social media and other forms of digital communications, how transparent they considered their organizations, what are their attitudes toward communicating about failure and more. Among the findings: Communications professionals at America's grantmaking foundations are responding to the digital age. Our survey of 155 foundation communicators shows U. S. foundations are making use of all forms digital communications, especially social media, a top priority.

40|$|Background As {{part of a}} multi-pronged {{strategy}} to improve ecological integrity on 300 million high priority acres in the West by 2035, the Hewlett Foundation seeks to target and increase public funding for private land conservation. The Hewlett Foundation has funded the Trust for Public Land and The Nature Conservancy for several years to raise public funding for conservation through ballot and legislative initiatives. This study examines {{the extent to which}} private lands protected through public funding have improved ecological integrity in the West. It also considers which combinations of funding mechanisms and government levels have yielded the highest returns for ecological integrity, in terms of acres protected. The purpose of this evaluation is to provide a set of lessons learned about past conservation finance activities to inform the Hewlett Foundation’s new five-year strategic plan for its Western Conservation Program in 2014 - 2018. Methodology and Principal Findings Private lands protected using public funding were examined using GIS and the Conservation Almanac dataset to determine the degree to which protected lands overlap with the Hewlett Foundation’s <b>internal</b> <b>priority</b> areas. The results of ballot measures were also analyzed using the LandVote Database for the 12 Western states to examine how public conservation funding has changed by year and across states during 1988 - 2012. This study found that 2, 521, 311 acres of land were protected for ecological integrity in the West during 1998 - 2011. Of all funding mechanisms and jurisdiction combinations, federal appropriations protected the highest number of aggregate acres for ecological integrity. Among lands located in overlapping priority areas, appropriations and donations contributed the highest acreage for protecting ecologically important lands, whereas lottery funding tended to be used for protecting land of lower ecological value. Bonds at the state level have generated roughly 40 percent of all new conservation funding in the West since 1988. Recommendations 1. Prioritize the re-authorization of funding with a near-term expiration date to maximize the generation of public funding for private land conservation. 2. Continue to use feasibility studies to ascertain the optimal funding mechanism type for ballot initiatives, with knowledge that bonds have been the most successful mechanism to date. 3. Collaborate with The Nature Conservancy’s Conservation Lands Program to jointly identify mutual targets for ecosystem-level conservation in the West. 4. Continue to fund data collection and standardization initiatives, such as the LandVote and Conservation Almanac databases maintained by the Trust for Public Land. 5. Use a model on a finer scale than the current Focal Areas layer to assess ecological and political threats to lands in the West. 6. Expand the messaging platform of conservation finance to target forest restoration as a means of preventing catastrophic wildfire and protecting public drinking water supplies...|$|E

40|$|Congressional enactments and {{executive}} orders instruct agencies to publish their anticipated rules {{in what is}} known as the Unified Agenda. The Agenda’s stated purpose is to ensure that political actors can monitor regulatory development. Agencies have come under fire in recent years, however, for conspicuous omissions and irregularities. Critics allege that agencies hide their regulations from the public strategically, that is, to thwart potential political opposition. Others contend that such behavior is benign, perhaps the inevitable result of changing <b>internal</b> <b>priorities</b> or unforeseen events. To examine these competing hypotheses, this Article uses a new dataset spanning over thirty years of rulemaking (1983 – 2014). Uniquely, the dataset is drawn directly from the Federal Register. The resulting findings reveal that agencies substantially underreport their rulemaking activities—about 70 percent of their proposed rules do not appear on the Unified Agenda before publication. Importantly, agencies also appear to disclose strategically with respect to Congress, though not with respect to the president. The Unified Agenda is thus not a successful tool for Congress to monitor and influence regulatory development. The results suggest that legislative, not executive, innovations may help to augment public participation and democratic oversight, though the net effects of more transparency remain uncertain. The findings also raise further inquiries, such as why Congress does not render disclosure requirements judicially enforceable...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach – This is a qualitative study of an inter-firm supply relationship where the two partners were interdependent {{as a result of a}} “closed loop” supply relationship. The paper explores the perspectives of employees at multiple levels within both partners, and collects pluralist evidence from 36 interviewees from both sides of the dyad. It collects documentary evidence such as minutes, contractual agreements and HR documents. This paper re-analyses the evidence from earlier work using an institutional theory framework. Findings – Using Scott's “three pillars” the paper shows that HR practices can act as carriers of regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive elements in interdependent supply relationships through both formal and informal mechanisms. Regulative elements were less evident, but could be fundamental in shaping the other two. A tension was found between institutional pressures at the inter- and intra-firm levels, an emergence of innovative practices and new routines at inter-organizational level, and an evolution over time that could involve a de-institutionalisation of the relationship as a result of <b>internal</b> <b>priorities</b> competing with the resource requirements of the supply relationship.

SPARS, (figure 1), is a student-centred {{framework}} that offers personalised academic learning support {{and resources to}} enhance student success. The framework is underpinned by Chickering & Reisser's (1993) vectors of development and Bronfenbrenner's (1979) integrative ecological approach in development, situated on Tait's (2000) student support framework for open and distance learning (ODL). It further adds a layer of connection to student engagement (Kuh et al, 2007). The framework facilitates a repositioning of student experience by marrying the co-curricular (professional) and curricular (academic) 'places' of learning harnessed by technologies (core learning and student management systems) - three common milieus - that Pascarella and Terenzini (2005) call the interconnections that {{are more likely to}} produce a more effective educational experience. SPARS provides a personalised 'place' of learning for all students, across the various phases of the student learning journey, from first inquiry to post graduation. It does this by pulling all relevant academic, administrative and personal resources situated 'outside classrooms' to facilitate students' learning 'inside classrooms'. The analytics of these systems provide affordances for on-going development strategies and reporting. The accompanying proposed assessment framework, (figure 2,) will generate assessment data based on measurable outcomes that consider external and <b>internal</b> <b>priorities</b> for the individual student and the university as a whole.

40|$|Accountability Through Diversity: Challenges for Congregation-Based Community Organizing in Detroit By Lara C. Rusch Advisor: Gregory Markus 	Social capital theory {{suggests}} that bonding institutions such as religious congregations provide unique resources for civic engagement, especially for resource-poor groups, but the translation of those resources into political action is problematic for democracy. As a resource for collective action social capital seems to operate duplicitously, reifying some inequalities even while challenging others. How can religious institutions support democratic or “public-spirited” collective action, {{in addition to their}} contributions to associational life? What challenges must be overcome? More broadly, how can private social capital lead to political action for public goods? 	The dissertation approaches these questions through analysis of the history and organizing strategy of MOSES, a congregation-based community organizing project in Detroit. Through in-depth interviews with organizers, lay leaders and clergy, participant observation, and archival research, this study investigates challenges facing MOSES from 1989 to 2006. Observation of MOSES suggests two kinds of problems for collective action among congregations: external pressures and <b>internal</b> <b>priorities.</b> First, the political and economic context matters for the translation of civic energies into democratic political action. Congregations’ political capacity is constrained by the pressures to adapt, by political dynamics that discourage interracial collaboration, and by the legacies of segregation and mistrust in Detroit. Second, the tendency of congregations to be inward-looking and to maintain internal power arrangements can undermine leadership development, depending on actors’ interpretation and enactment of religious authority. Community organizers overcome these limitations through the development of bridging social capital, though bridging relationships also bring new challenges and tensions for political collaboration. The practical challenges faced by the organizing model suggest need for a more grounded theory of bridging that attends to the power relations inherent to any bridging relationship. This research elaborates the theory of bridging by distinguishing it as more purposefully instrumental than bonding and acknowledging the unequal risks of bridging relationships for diverse participants. Organizing practices provide a means by which private institutions can contribute to public-spirited collective action and act accountably to diverse collaborators...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} set of motivations and {{constraints}} involved in the purchasing of products perceived to be environmentally friendly, a phenomenon termed green consumerism, and in related forms of public environmentalism, including household-based recycling and membership of organised environmental groups. Both the public and members of organised environmental groups are of interest as potential green consumers, as well as retailers acting as providers of products and information relevant to green consumerism. The emphasis is upon {{the development of an}} integrated qualitative framework for studying environmental motivation and behaviour, and the understanding of the interplay of motivations and constraints at the individual level. Individual motivations are studied with respect to perceived responsibility for the environment and the rationalisation of this {{on the basis of the}} perceived cumulative impact of public environmentalism en masse. Constraints upon the translation of this responsibility into behaviour include economic priorities, cultural contexts and quality of life concerns and may be external (socially imposed) or internal to the individual. The latter case represents the refusal to sacrifice and the agency therefore present in the choice of proenvironmental behaviour. Retailers motivations are also studied with respect to perceived environmental responsibility, but the economic context of business gives economic constraints higher priority and more power to constrain environmental responsibility than moral judgements alone. Retailers, the media and environmental groups also function as information providers to seek public support. The uncertainty of much environmental information and the layperson’s perceived lack of evaluative ability work to constrain the usability of environmental information and to permit distrust of experts and elites perceived to be in control of information dissemination, within a wider trust of systems of information provision. The immediacy of information links clearly to action, whereas wider issues and impacts further into the future are more weakly connected to proenvironmental behaviour. Generally, the proenvironmental action taken on the basis of these motivations and constraints is perceived as individualistic rather than collective. All these themes indicate that green consumerism, like other public proenvironmental behaviours, depends upon information, responsibility and the belief in impact. However, contextual constraints of cultural norms, economic situations and <b>internal</b> <b>priorities</b> mediate in the adoption of such behaviours. Upcoming changes in law and markets may influence these factors, making the future of this very recent phenomenon as dynamic as its past. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate the relationship between personality type and leadership focus. Personality type is studied {{from the perspective of}} Jungian Theory and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator instrument, and leadership focus is explored through the development and application of a Leadership Focus Questionnaire. South African executives form the target population for this research. The overall research problem concerns how best to address the challenges of optimising focus and managing risk that is inherent in strategic leadership. Both functionalist and interpretive approaches were applied to produce a rounded understanding of what constitutes leadership focus. The application of a functionalist approach resulted in three primary theoretical hypotheses being derived from the literature, namely, that leadership focus is a function of (1) optimising the balance of focus between external and <b>internal</b> <b>priorities,</b> (2) the fit between the leadership personality type and the organisation type, and (3) the capacity to manage a multiple focus. The interpretation of the responses from the sample of executives participating in the research study yielded a related set of first and second order factors relating to leadership focus that revolve around the level of comfort experienced by executives in managing focus in the leadership role. The approach to this research was one of methodological triangulation. A survey-based methodology was employed, containing both quantitative and qualitative questions. The results of the quantitative analysis of the relationship between personality type and leadership focus were contrasted and extended by a qualitative content analysis of the qualitative survey responses. The propositions were tested on a sample of South African executives attending management development programmes run by Wits Business School, University of Witwatersrand, in both Johannesburg and Cape Town. The findings show that Extraverted personality types are more comfortable with the challenges of focus in the leadership role than are Introverted types. In addition, Extraverted, Sensing, Thinking and Judging types experience a greater degree of fit with their organisations than do Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Perceiving types. The implications are that in a business environment of ongoing change, market innovation and increasing stakeholder expectations, organisation leaders of all personality types need to develop a greater consciousness of their preferred and less preferred behaviours, and a greater ability to complement their preferred leadership behaviours with less preferred behaviours when necessary, to optimise their leadership focus over time.

40|$|Crowd {{simulation}} {{has become}} an essential asset in many different industries, ranging from games and movies to engineering and construction; while the requirements might vary significantly between these domains, the underlying theory is shared among them. Emergency simulation in particular is a field that has made great use of crowd simulation to validate and improve building design and layouts, allowing architects to determine how a building would cope {{in case of an}} evacuation and determine the estimated egress time and survival rate. Existing algorithms and techniques are usually organised in two layers: a high level component determines the actions and goals of each agent that is participating in the simulation while the low level component is responsible for the movement of the agent. Steering behaviours [Reynolds 1987] are usually employed for movement, but they don’t take into account more nuanced aspects of agents behaviour like their <b>internal</b> state, <b>priorities</b> and system of beliefs [Pelechano et al. 2007]. This is particularly important for emergency simulations as individuals react in different ways under stressful circumstances and factors like fatigue and caring for others {{must be taken into account}} to provide an accurate simulation...|$|R
40|$|En el artículo se plantea la relación existente entre los "planes de mejora y las organizaciones educativas que aprenden", además de cómo la calidad educativa no tiene sentido, actualmente, sin su simbiosis. Por otra parte, la paradójica situación generada por el acercamiento de los modelos empresariales de gestión de la calidad, al ámbito educativo, se ve resuelta cuando los planes de mejora se basan en la institución educativa, {{en la escuela}} como unidad, pero también en el docente como eje del proceso de cambio. Las innovaciones que se desarrollen deben empezar en el aula, pero deben influir en todos los niveles de la organización. No existirá mejora de la escuela sin decisiones claras sobre el desarrollo y el mantenimiento del proceso. Ha de intentarse equilibrar "el cambio y la estabilidad", o dicho de otro modo, tomar decisiones sobre qué cambios llevar a cabo y cómo relacionarlos entre sí, manteniendo lo bueno y positivo que hay en la escuela sin dejar de {{responder}} a la innovación. El éxito de la mejora de la escuela implica adaptar cambios externos a propósitos internos. Así, está demostrado cómo las escuelas que reconocen la consonancia entre prioridades internas propias del centro y las exigencias externas (más propias del contexto sociocultural) responden mejor a la reforma educativa. The article {{talks about}} the relationship between "plans of improvement and educational organizations that learn", and about how the quality in education does not make sense, at the moment, without their symbiosis. On the other hand, the paradoxical situation generated by the approach of Education to business and quality management models, is solved when the plans of improvement are based on the educational institution, at school as a unit, but also on the teacher as the axis of the process of change. The innovations to be developed should begin at the classroom, but they should affect every level of the organization. No school improvement will exist without clear decisions on the development and the maintenance of the process. A balance between change and stability should be aimed to, or in other words, to make decisions on which changes to carry out and how to relate them to each other, maintaining the good and positive things at school without quitting to respond to innovation. The success of school improvement implies to adapt external changes to internal purposes. Thus, it is proved that those schools that recognize the consonance between <b>internal</b> <b>priorities</b> (belonging to the center) and external demands (more characteristic of the social/cultural contexts) respond better to educational reforms...|$|R
