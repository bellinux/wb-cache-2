5|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some {{children with autism}} reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> of Johnson's stint, the Suns {{were fairly}} successful, {{reaching}} the Western Conference Semifinals both seasons. The Suns bowed {{out in the}} first round in Johnson's last year. Johnson's situation deteriorated towards {{the end of his career}} at Phoenix. Like in Seattle, he often clashed with his coach, John MacLeod, and finally was traded by general manager, Jerry Colangelo, to the Boston Celtics for Rick Robey and draft picks. Like Seattle after Johnson's departure, the Suns finished 12 games worse in the next season despite the addition of Robey.|$|E

Obama nominated Elena Kagan on May 10, 2010 to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three justices {{for the first time in}} American history.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships of}} the Deutschland class {{continued}} {{to serve in}} the II Battle Squadron during World War I. The ships conducted patrols in the mouth of the Elbe River in the first weeks of the war {{while the rest of the}} fleet was still being mobilized. They also took part in most of the major fleet actions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> of the war. This primarily included acting as a support force for the battlecruisers that bombarded the English coast in the hopes of luring out a portion of the British fleet.|$|E
5|$|D Charitable Foundation was {{established}} by Borislow in 1997 with a $21 million stock donation. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> he tried to use the charity to buy and preserve a tract of land in New Hope, Pennsylvania. This venture failed in 1998 when the property owner declined Borislow's offer. Following this, D made donations to the Clearwater Endoscopy Center and the Center for Digestive Healthcare in Clearwater, Florida until 2001. Since then, it has issued varied grants to causes Borislow supported, such as $2.75 million to two yeshivas and $173,450 to a West Palm Beach, Florida private school. Tax records indicate that Borislow and George Farley, {{the chief financial officer}} of the non-profit, split approximately $2.1 million in profits from 2001-2005, while $1.6 million went to charitable causes. Borislow drew criticism in 2007 when he paid himself $1.7 million through the charity.|$|E

5|$|Deutschland {{served as}} the {{flagship}} of the High Seas Fleet until 1913, when she {{was transferred to the}} II Battle Squadron. With the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, she and her sister ships were tasked with defending the mouth of the Elbe and the German Bight from possible British incursions. Deutschland and the other ships of the II Battle Squadron participated in most of the large-scale fleet operations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> of the war, culminating in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May– 1 June 1916. Late {{on the first day of}} the battle, Deutschland and the other pre-dreadnoughts briefly engaged several British battlecruisers before retreating.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden was {{churning}} out a repertoire – new songs, new plays, and translations of plays from Romanian, French, and other languages (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> he wrote 22 plays, and would eventually write about 40) – {{and while he}} was not always able to retain the players in his company once they became stars in their own right, he continued for many years to recruit first-rate talent, and his company became a de facto training ground for Yiddish theater. By the end of the year, others were writing Yiddish plays as well, such as Moses Horowitz with Der tiranisher bankir (The Tyrannical Banker), or Grodner with Curve un ganev (Prostitute and Thief), and Yiddish theater had become big theater, with elaborate sets, duelling choruses, and extras to fill out crowd scenes.|$|E
5|$|The {{second child}} of Johnstone Melmore and Jessie Francis Leech, Leech {{was born in}} Bendigo in Australia. She was given the name Faith after her elder sister, who died from leukaemia {{at the age of}} two. A {{delicate}} child, Leech had an aversion to eating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> of her life, so her mother fed her in small hourly doses. Leech was twice rushed from the family home to a Melbourne hospital. Conventional medicine failed to rectify Leech's dietary issues, so her mother put her on a fast for ten days at the recommendation of a naturopath. Leech was later placed on a diet of fruit, salad and vegetables, with an emphasis on beetroot juice and carrot juice.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 24 clubs {{have reached the}} final, of whom 16 have won the competition. The first winners were Dundee in 1990. The most {{successful}} club is Falkirk with four wins from four final appearances. Ross County, Hamilton Academical and Queen of the South have also reached the final four times, all winning and losing twice each. Three clubs have reached the final in successive seasons; Ayr United did so <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> of the tournament but lost both. The only teams to have successfully defended their title are Hamilton Academical and the original Airdrieonians. It is possible for {{the winner of the}} tournament to be unable to defend their title; if a club is promoted from the Scottish Championship (second tier) in the same season to the Scottish Premiership (first tier), the club becomes ineligible to compete in the tournament. This has happened to Falkirk twice, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, St Mirren and Rangers.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} of the Cold War began <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> {{after the end of the}} Second World War in 1945. The USSR {{consolidated}} its control over the states of the Eastern Bloc, while the United States began a strategy of global containment to challenge Soviet power, extending military and financial aid to the countries of Western Europe (for example, supporting the anti-communist side in the Greek Civil War) and creating the NATO alliance. The Berlin Blockade (1948–49) was the first major crisis of the Cold War. With the victory of the communist side in the Chinese Civil War and the outbreak of the Korean War (1950–53), the conflict expanded. The USSR and USA competed for influence in Latin America and the decolonizing states of Africa and Asia. Meanwhile, the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was stopped by the Soviets. The expansion and escalation sparked more crises, such as the Suez Crisis (1956), the Berlin Crisis of 1961, and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, a new phase began that saw the Sino-Soviet split complicate relations within the communist sphere, while US allies, particularly France, demonstrated greater independence of action. The USSR crushed the 1968 Prague Spring liberalization program in Czechoslovakia, and the Vietnam War (1955–75) ended with the defeat of the US-backed Republic of Vietnam, prompting further adjustments.|$|E
