Depending {{on the size of}} the implement, and the number of furrows it is designed to plough at one time, a <b>forecarriage</b> with a wheel or wheels (known as a furrow wheel and support wheel) may be added to support the frame (wheeled plough). In the case of a single-furrow plough there is only one wheel at the front and handles at the rear for the ploughman to steer and manoeuvre it.|$|E
50|$|Beneath the {{carriage}} body is the undergear or undercarriage (or simply carriage), {{consisting of the}} running gear and chassis. The wheels and axles, in distinction from the body, are the running gear. The wheels revolve upon bearings or a spindle {{at the ends of}} a bar or beam called an axle or axletree. Most carriages have either one or two axles. On a four-wheeled vehicle, the forward part of the running gear, or <b>forecarriage,</b> is arranged to permit the front axle to turn independently of the fixed rear axle. In some carriages a 'dropped axle', bent twice at a right angle near the ends, allows a low body with large wheels. A guard called a dirtboard keeps dirt from the axle arm.|$|E
5000|$|Little {{is known}} about Collingwood's townsfolk, much of the {{knowledge}} coming from the cemetery records that have survived - and there are only eight of those. Two of those buried at the former graveyard - both of them babies (which in itself says something about infant mortality in late colonial Australia) - bore the name Tranby. This same name figured in an 1890 newspaper report that mentioned a horse and buggy accident on the road from Winton to Collingwood. The buggy was driven by a Mr. Tranby - his first name is not given - and he was driving a party to Collingwood, apparently to attend the races (see Collingwood races below), when it [...] "came to grief" [...] and the buggy's <b>forecarriage</b> was torn right off [...] "horses and all", throwing everybody out of the buggy. Nobody was badly hurt, but the party had {{to spend the night}} in the bush. The report, perhaps meaning to incite sensation, mentioned that the overnight party included a young lady. It is also interesting to note that Mr. Tranby had apparently been in Winton on business, suggesting that by 1890, Winton was already outshining Collingwood as the region's commercial hub.|$|E
5000|$|Caii lui Cibicioc, {{the first}} volume {{published}} by Ion Călugăru, {{was also the first}} of several works to focus on its author's rural background. Several of the stories, reminiscent of Creangă, are jocular accounts of childhood. They include the title work, which shows the youngsters Ițe and Șămă casually plotting to steal the eponymous horses. This stream is combined with more dramatic accounts, such as the piece in which Hakham Șmaia, unable to impose his paternal will, commits suicide. Călinescu also argued: [...] "The most personal part in the literature of Ion Călugăru ... is the one dealing with the Jewry of upper Moldavia. ... In Caii lui Cibicioc and in Abecedar de povestiri populare the depiction is still shy or ruined by Surrealist methods. Still, even at this stage one will be struck by this strange, almost peasant-like, world, comprising <b>forecarriage</b> drivers, millers, porters, cabmen, water-carriers, shepherds, vagrant children, talkative old women." [...] The same commentator added: [...] "The hakhams, the synagogue janitors, the bath house attendants and the tailors do not manage to shatter the image of an autochthonous village. Only the candle lights visible inside houses ..., the old payot-wearing men on their way back from the synagogue, book in hand, everyone's allusions to biblical times, allow one's eyes to identify the distinct race." ...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical experience {{was carried out}} to investigate the nonlinear dynamic response of the <b>forecarriage</b> of a motorcycle, paying attention to {{a particular type of}} vibration that occurs during the braking. In fact, it was found that, in particular conditions of load on the handlebar, braking pressure, speed and temperature, the first flexural mode of the front fork is strongly excited. Thanks to the numerical model, solutions to these undesired vibrations were identified. Experimental tests were carried out modifying the design parameters of the motorcycles and of the braking system as suggested by the numerical model thus verifying that the purposed solutions were effective...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} presents Epi. q- 1. 2, a smart mini robot {{able to move}} on flat, inclined, undulating or uneven terrain, {{to climb}} over obstacles, to go up stairs and to change its kind of locomotion from a rolling (on wheels) to a stepping (on legs) one. The kind of locomotion changes automatically according to ground conditions or thanks to an axial device. Moreover robot locomotion unit can vary its geometry from a closed configuration to an open one: the first configuration is suitable to reach restricted spaces and the second one to get over high obstacles. All these kinds of functioning are obtained thanks to its innovative driving device that consists of a double epicyclic gearing and an axial device, able to lock or free some DOFs along the kinematic chain. Epi. q- 1. 2 consists of three elements: the <b>forecarriage,</b> the central body and the rear axle, these three elements are linked by two mutually perpendicular cylindrical joints that grant to the robot great mobility and a correct contact between wheels and ground, even in presence of uneven terrain. Epi. q- 1. 2 overall dimensions are about 160 × 360 × 280 mm (height×length×width) and weighs about 2, 6 kg. The robot was designed {{on the basis of}} the results of some kinematic and dynamic models presented in this paper. It was experimentally tested on flat ground, slopes, uneven terrain, it goes up stairs and climbs over 90 mm obstacles, that are 72 % of the locomotion unit heigh...|$|E
