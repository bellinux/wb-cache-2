40|$|A restauração florestal em matas ciliares é de suma importância para os processos de recuperação de áreas degradadas e conectividade da flora e fauna. O presente experimento foi instalado às margens do reservatório de Borborema - SP, com o objetivo de averiguar o acúmulo de biomassa de trinta espécies arbóreas nativas frente a dois sistemas silviculturais e dois tipos de recipientes de produção de mudas. O ensaio foi instalado em duas áreas com umidade de solo distintas, sendo uma mais seca, sem encharcamento mesmo em períodos chuvosos, outra mais úmida, com encharcamento. Os sistemas de manejo testados foram: i) convencional e operacionalmente utilizado pela empresa AES-Tietê; e ii) potencial, com maior nutrição e maior controle de mato-competição. Os recipientes de produção de mudas testados foram o tubete pequeno, com 56 cm 3; e tubete grande com 290 cm 3. O estudo foi instalado em fatorial 2 x 2, com os fatores Manejo e Tubete e dois níveis de cada fator (potencial e convencional, e tubete pequeno e grande) com quatro repetições na área seca. Não ocorreu interação entre os fatores estudados. Na área seca, o tratamento que utilizou tubete grande e manejo potencial apresentou diâmetro e altura 30 % {{superior}}es que o tratamento que utilizou tubete pequeno e manejo convencional, e uma superioridade em 70 % no Índice de Área Foliar e 62 % no acúmulo de biomassa aos dois anos. O tubete grande apresentou sobrevivência de plantio 13 % superior ao tubete pequeno e ganho em biomassa média das mudas de 43 %. O manejo potencial apresentou área basal superior ao manejo convencional (6, 23 versus 4, 09 m 2 ha- 1) e IAF superior (1, 28 versus 0, 58 m 2 m- 2). Na área úmida, as zonas de alagamento baixo, médio e total apresentaram área basal decrescentes de 4, 4 m 2 ha- 1, 2, 6 m 2 ha- 1 e 0, 9 m 2 ha- 1. Com esses resultados é possível concluir que as espécies nativas possuem capacidade de melhor desempenho quando produzidas em tubetes maiores e sob sistema silvicultural mais intensivo e que o alagamento (falta de aeração da raiz) é um estresse ambiental que requer melhor compreensão por ser altamente limitante à restauração com as espécies tradicionais. Riparian {{forest restoration}} {{is extremely important}} for the processes of degraded areas restoration and connectivity of flora and fauna. This study was established on the Reservoirs of the Borborema Lake - SP, with the purpose to determine the biomass accumulation of thirty tree species native to two silvicultural systems and two sizes of <b>hard</b> plastic <b>tubes</b> for seedling production. This trial was conducted in two areas with different soil moisture, a more drought, without flooding even during rainy periods, and another more humid, with frequent flooding. The following silvicultural systems were tested: i) traditional, one who is operationally used by the AES Tiete company; ii) potential, with greater nutrition and greater weed control. The containers for seedlings production tested were small <b>hard</b> plastic <b>tubes</b> with 56 cm 3, and large <b>hard</b> plastic <b>tubes</b> with 290 cm 3. The study {{was carried out in}} a factorial 22, with factors such as silvicultural systems and sizes of recipients, being two levels of each factor (potential, traditional, small and large <b>hard</b> plastic <b>tubes)</b> and four replications in a dry area. There was no interaction between the factors studied. In dry area the treatment that used large <b>hard</b> plastic <b>tubes</b> and potential silvicultural system showed diameter and height 30 % higher than the treatment that used small <b>hard</b> plastic <b>tubes</b> and traditional silvicultural system, and also a superiority of 70 % for the Leaf Area Index and 62 % for biomass to two years. The seedlings produced in large <b>hard</b> plastic <b>tubes</b> showed survival at planting 13 % higher than those grown in small <b>hard</b> plastic <b>tubes.</b> Was also observed that the mean biomass of seedlings was 43 % higher for treatment of large tubes. Potential silvicultural system showed basal area greater than the traditional silvicultural system (6. 23 vs. 4. 09 m 2 ha- 1) and higher LAI (1. 28 vs. 0. 58 m 2 m- 2). In the wetlands, the zones of low, medium and high flooding frequency showed decreasing basal area of 4. 4 m 2 ha- 1, 2. 6 m 2 ha- 1 and 0. 9 m 2 ha- 1. With these results we can conclude that native species have a higher performance when produced in large <b>hard</b> plastic <b>tubes</b> and under more intensive silvicultural system and flooding (lack of aeration of the root) is an environmental stress that requires better understanding because it is factor highly limiting for the restoration with the traditional species...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- The {{phenomenon}} of valveless pumping is studied {{in a ring}} consisting of two tubes, a flexible and a hard one filled with water. A non zero mean flow-rate is established via a reciprocating flat plate compressing and decompressing {{a portion of the}} flexible tube with a controllable frequency and depth of compression. Four parameters of the problem were examined, namely the frequency of the oscillating plate, its length, the depth of compression and the location where the tube is compressed. Four signals were simultaneously recorded, namely the flow-rate at the mid length of the <b>hard</b> <b>tube,</b> the static pressure at the tube’s ends and the displacement of the oscillating plate. Also, the tube cross-sectional area was measured versus the displacement of the oscillating plate for various values of the maximum depth of compression. Analysis of the obtained data showed that a unidirectional flow is established increasing the frequency of compression and it maximizes when the compression frequency coincides with the natural frequency of the hydraulic loop. The mean value of the flow-rate increases when the point of compression moves far from the mid length of the flexible tube, when the length of the reciprocating plate increases and when the depth of compression increases. With regard to the direction of the flow this is from the area of the tube compression {{towards the end of the}} <b>hard</b> <b>tube</b> which is located closer to the compression area...|$|E
