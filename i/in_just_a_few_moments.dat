50|$|Constantine II refused Papandreou's {{demand and}} {{accepted}} his subsequent resignation. The political turmoil began {{from this point}} and arose {{from the fact that}} the King had already decided upon Papandreou's successor, Georgios Athanasiadis-Novas, who was waiting in an adjoining room during that meeting. The fact that Papandreou's successor was sworn <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> after Papandreou's resignation caused a great amount of criticism, and created the impression that the King wanted to get rid of Papandreou all along.|$|E

5000|$|In {{this final}} verdict, {{two sets of}} judges will decide on who Canada's Worst Handyman is: first, a group of Cub Scouts will {{evaluate}} each room. There were relatively few criticisms for Angie's room, the only major faults being that some of her bathroom fittings were rather loose, and her coat rack completely fell apart during an impromptu [...] "stress test." [...] Numerous faults were noted in Brian's bedroom, and he was far more heavily criticized for a non-functioning bathroom (a girl scout noted {{that she would not}} shower in Brian's bathroom due to lacking a curtain). Johnnie is criticized for not finishing many challenges (among the scouts with a carpentry badge, none said that Johnnie deserved a carpentry badge), and embarrassingly, two of the scouts were able to fix <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> a plumbing problem that Johnnie had been baffled by for several days. There were no faults noted with Eric's bedroom, though he was tasked for a poor bathroom (rated 4/10 by one scout). In the end, though, the cub scouts agree that neither Eric nor Angie is Canada's Worst Handyman, though they are split between Brian and Johnnie.|$|E

40|$|Handbook of Formulas in Chinese Medicine is a concise, visual {{reference}} to over 180 {{of the most}} important herbal formulas in Chinese medicine. The book is designed to provide a snapshot of the formulas and help the reader take in key information at a glance. Each formula is presented as a two-page spread. On the left is a drawing of a person showing an aspect that is typical of the type of patient for whom the formula might be prescribed. The drawing is labelled with key symptoms. Under the drawing is a list of ingredients followed by basic information: actions, main pattern, key and secondary symptoms, tongue, pulse and abdomen. This can be absorbed <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b> Additional detail is set forth in clinical notes, and other formulas with similar indications are discussed for purposes of comparison.

The role that each ingredient plays in the formula (chief, deputy, assistant, envoy) as well as its actions are also shown. An introduction discusses how different types of processing affect the functions of particular herbs, and there is a helpful introduction to the Japanese approach to abdominal diagnosis and its value in prescribing herbs. A formula index (by pinyin and English common name) and an index of patterns and key symptoms are included...|$|E
