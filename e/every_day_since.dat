5|$|In December 2013, Burger King {{returned}} to Finland after {{three decades of}} absence. The first restaurant, located on Mannerheimintie in central Helsinki, instantly proved so popular that for <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>since</b> its opening, people have had to queue {{in front of the}} restaurant to get in, sometimes for over half an hour. The only exception so far has been Christmas time, when the restaurant was closed. According to Mikko Molberg, the leader of the Finnish Burger King franchise, the restaurant has attracted over 2000 customers on every single day, which has surprised the restaurant employees and the franchise owners. The long queues have been extensively covered and ridiculed in social media, comparing them to people queuing in front of a McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, Russia in the early 1990s, and contrasting them with the nearly nonexistent queues to Burger King restaurants in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E

25|$|In the 2016 {{video game}} , the {{character}} Sorin Sprocket is eventually revealed to have anterograde amnesia, which he developed after unintentionally causing {{a car accident}} which killed his sister. This causes his memories to completely reset every time he wakes up from sleeping, {{to the day after}} this accident. This depiction is notable for demonstrating the relationship issues that arise between Sorin and his fiancee, Ellen Wyatt, {{as a result of this}} disorder, most noticeably with how Sorin's feelings towards her to coming across as distant and cold. As the storyline continues, however, the player comes to uncover that Sorin in fact deeply loves his fiancee, and is able to maintain this love despite his disorder, but in fact feels a sense of guilt over the fact that he has to constantly remind himself of the fact that this love exists inside of him every day, due to his disorder. It is also noticeable in that it depicts how Sorin deals with his disorder, by keeping a journal where he writes down every minuet detail of every day after his sister's death. He carries this journal around everywhere he goes as a substitution to his memories, and uses what is written in the notebook to become aware each time he wakes up of the fact that he he his condition, what the current date apparently is, and everything important that have apparently occurred on <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>since</b> he first developed the condition. The episode also deals with legal issues concerning the disorder, when it is debated during Ellen Wyatt's trial as to whether Sorin's journal can be considered a proper substitution to his memories for the sake of viable witness testimony. Danger's imposed by this also come into play when it is revealed that a page in Sorin's journal had been altered by someone, which causes him to go into mental collapse that any of his other memories and thoughts could also have arisen from someone else's manipulation.|$|E

J claimed that the safety of cosmetic talc is supported by decades of scientific evidence and it plans to appeal the verdict. The British charity, Ovacome was quoted as saying that while there were 16 studies which showed that using talc increased the risk of ovarian cancer by around a third and that a 2013 review of US studies came up with similar results for genital, but not general talcum powder use, J were not convinced that the results were reliable.

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to many leaders who received these reports {{and failed to}} act on them, Mantello publicized the details within a day of receiving them. This triggered a significant grass roots protest in Switzerland, including Sunday masses, street protests, and the Swiss Press Campaign; over 400 headlines in the Swiss press demanded (against censorship rules) {{an end to the}} deportations. The reports publication resulted in Winston Churchill's letter:""There is no doubt that this persecution of Jews in Hungary and their expulsion from enemy territory is probably the greatest and most horrible crime ever committed in the whole history of the world...." [...] As a result of the press coverage, world leaders issued appeals and warnings to Hungary's Regent, Miklós Horthy, and the mass transports, which had been deporting 12,000 Jews <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>since</b> 15 May 1944, ended on 9 July 1944. The lull in deportations made it possible to organize significant rescue activities in Hungary, such as the Raoul Wallenberg and Carl Lutz missions.|$|E
2500|$|From there, word-of-mouth spread. In 2003, the {{non-profit}} Foundation for US Historical Monuments {{was formed to}} help bring about the monument's creation. After their efforts faltered, an anonymous [...] group of Wall Street bankers who lost friends and co-workers in the [...] 9/11 attacks learned about his sculpture. They commissioned Blumberg to build a large-scale version for a monument near Ground Zero, paying $500,000 for the work. The Gary Sinese Foundation and the Green Beret Foundation supported the effort to build the monument. No public funds were used. Two of the individual Wall Street supporters said they were asked by families and friends {{if there was a}} place that individuals could go to remember the U.S. troops overseas who daily combat potential terrorist threats. [...] "We wanted to do something for the special operations community and all military service branches, because <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>since</b> 9/11, we've had to look at that hole in the ground," [...] one of the private backers says. [...] "What everyone needs to know is: There are people out there like this team, like the Green Berets, that are willing to sacrifice at all costs for them."
