25|$|After {{the demise}} of the Ninety-Eight in 1996, Oldsmobile added the Regency to the 1997 and 1998 lineups, which used the same front fenders and chrome grille as the Ninety-Eight sedan but kept the {{standard}} Eighty-Eight body. The Regency featured a long list of standard features including traction control, leather upholstery, dual 6-way power seats with power lumbar and a driver's side memory function, a dual-zone automatic climate control system, and an <b>electronic</b> <b>level</b> control for the rear suspension. A driver's side electrochromic outside mirror was also standard on the Regency, a feature that even Cadillac didn't offer as standard equipment. The interior day/night auto-dimming mirror was linked to the outside mirror and dimmed both with the same intensity at the same time. Some of these options, like the 2-driver memory feature, were not available on the Eighty-Eight Royale or LSS.|$|E
25|$|In {{a report}} {{published}} in 1926 in Transactions of the Faraday Society, James Franck {{was concerned with}} the mechanisms of photon-induced chemical reactions. The presumed mechanism was the excitation of a molecule by a photon, followed by a collision with another molecule during the short period of excitation. The question was whether {{it was possible for}} a molecule to break into photoproducts in a single step, the absorption of a photon, and without a collision. In order for a molecule to break apart, it must acquire from the photon a vibrational energy exceeding the dissociation energy, that is, the energy to break a chemical bond. However, as was known at the time, molecules will only absorb energy corresponding to allowed quantum transitions, and there are no vibrational levels above the dissociation energy level of the potential well. High-energy photon absorption leads to a transition to a higher electronic state instead of dissociation. In examining how much vibrational energy a molecule could acquire when it is excited to a higher <b>electronic</b> <b>level,</b> and whether this vibrational energy could be enough to immediately break apart the molecule, he drew three diagrams representing the possible changes in binding energy between the lowest electronic state and higher electronic states.|$|E

The <b>electronic</b> energy <b>level</b> transition rates and ionization rates due to electron impacts are shown to reproduce theoretical and measured rates.

40|$|A {{method for}} calculating the <b>electronic</b> <b>levels</b> in the compact superheavy nuclear quasi-molecules, based on solving the two-center Dirac {{equation}} using the multipole expansion of two-center potential, is developed. For the internuclear distances up to d∼ 100 fm such technique reveals a quite fast convergence {{and allows for}} computing the <b>electronic</b> <b>levels</b> in such systems with accuracy ∼ 10 ^- 6. The critical distances R_cr between the nuclei for 1 σ_g and 1 σ_u <b>electronic</b> <b>levels</b> in the region Z≃ 87 - 100 are calculated. By means of the same technique the shifts of <b>electronic</b> <b>levels</b> due to the effective interaction Δ U_AMM of the electron's magnetic anomaly with the Coulomb field of the closely spaced heavy nuclei are evaluated {{as a function of}} the internuclear distance and the charge of the nuclei, non-perturbatively both in Zα and (partially) in α/π. It is shown, that the levels shifts near the lower continuum decrease with the enlarging size of the system of Coulomb sources both in the absolute units and in units of Z^ 4 α^ 5 / π n^ 3. The last result is generalized to the whole self-energy contribution to the level shifts and so to the possible behavior of radiative part of QED-effects with virtual photon exchange near the lower continuum in the overcritical region.

40|$|International audienceIn this work, a state-to-state {{vibrational}} {{and electronic}} collisional model is developed to investigate nonequilibrium phenomena behind a shock wave in an ionized nitrogen flow. In the ionization dynamics behind the shock wave, the electron energy budget is of key importance {{and it is}} found that the main depletion term corresponds to the electronic excitation of N atoms, and conversely the major creation terms are the electron-vibration term at the beginning, then replaced by the electron ions elastic exchange term. Based on these results, a macroscopic multi-internal-temperature model for the vibration of N 2 and the <b>electronic</b> <b>levels</b> of N atoms is derived with several groups of vibrational levels of N 2 and <b>electronic</b> <b>levels</b> of N with their own internal temperatures to model the shape of the vibrational distribution of N 2 and of the electronic excitation of N, respectively.
