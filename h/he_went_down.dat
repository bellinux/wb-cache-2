5|$|A {{first team}} regular {{alongside}} defensive partners Neil Aspin and Dean Glover, in summer 1992 {{he helped the}} club to win the pre-season TNT Tournament. His performances in the 1992–93 season saw him awarded {{a place on the}} PFA Second Division team. He was man of the match in the League Trophy final victory over Stockport County – despite suffering from a double hernia and being hungover from a secret boozing session the night before. The season finished on a negative note though, {{in the second half of}} the 1993 Second Division play-off final against West Bromwich Albion, with the game still goalless, Swan was sent off after bringing down Bob Taylor – who was through on goal. This proved to the turning point in the game as West Brom went on to win 3–0 to secure promotion at Vale's expense. It also meant that <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> in history as only the third Englishman to be sent off at Wembley, after Kevin Keegan and Lee Dixon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1925, Waugh's outlook briefly improved, with the {{prospect}} of a job in Pisa, Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff, who was engaged on the English translations of Marcel Proust's works. Believing that the job was his, Waugh resigned his position at Arnold House. He had meantime sent the early chapters of his novel to Acton for assessment and criticism. Acton's reply was so coolly dismissive that Waugh immediately burnt his manuscript; shortly afterwards, before he left North Wales, he learned that the Moncrieff job had fallen through. The twin blows were sufficient for him to consider suicide. He records that <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to a nearby beach and, leaving a note with his clothes, walked out to sea. An attack by jellyfish changed his mind, and he returned quickly to the shore.|$|E
5|$|At the 2009 Wimbledon Championships, {{his poor}} grass-court form {{from the past}} continued, as <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to unseeded Lleyton Hewitt in the second round. In the Davis Cup quarter-final against the Czech Republic, del Potro won his matches against Ivo Minář and Berdych in {{straight}} sets, but Argentina still lost the tie 2–3, eliminating them from the competition. A few weeks later, he defeated Hewitt and Fernando González {{en route to the}} Washington final. He successfully defended his title against top-seeded Wimbledon finalist Andy Roddick to win his second tournament of the year and become the first player since Andre Agassi to win back-to-back Washington titles. Del Potro played the following week at the Masters 1000 in Montreal, where he was seeded sixth, defeating world No. 2 Nadal in the quarterfinals, his second win in a row over Nadal. He then defeated Roddick in the semifinals, saving a match point, to advance to his first Masters 1000 final, and to improve his head-to-head record against Roddick to 3–0. In the final, he lost against Murray in three sets. He later withdrew from the next Masters 1000 event in Cincinnati due to fatigue.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland next {{faced the}} Brooklyn Dodgers, winning 55–7. The Browns scored three touchdowns {{in five minutes}} during the first quarter. Cleveland added five more touchdowns {{in the second half}} and held a {{comfortable}} lead to the end. Fullback Marion Motley ran for 111 yards on five carries and scored two touchdowns, including a 50-yard run {{at the beginning of the}} second half. Tommy Colella scored a touchdown on an 82-yard punt return, and Bill Lund ran back an interception 28 yards for another. It was in this game that the Draw play was accidentally invented when Otto Graham tripped while dropping back for a pass. As <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down,</b> sensing blitzers about to wallop him, he stuck the ball in Motley's stomach who scampered for a sizable gain. Liking the effect, Brown added it to the playbook during halftime. By the next game the play became a staple of the offense with several versions for different situations. As Cleveland's lead increased in the second half, Brown put in second-string players. Quarterback Otto Graham was replaced by Ermal Allen, who threw for two of the Browns' touchdowns and intercepted a pass while playing on defense. Cliff Lewis, Graham's primary backup, also played in the game. Brooklyn's only score came in the second quarter on a Bob Hoernschemeyer rush. The Dodgers were hurt by short punts from Mickey Colmer and a poor passing game. The team was held to 39 yards of passing. Edgar Jones, Cleveland's primary halfback suffered an elbow injury during the game.|$|E
5|$|While Margarito did not land {{a lot of}} punches, he {{remained}} the more engaged fighter in the sixth round. A left hook to the body had Cotto on the defensive early in the seventh round, but {{he was able to}} fend off additional difficulty. A right hand from Cotto slowed Margarito, but he returned with punches that forced Cotto to clinch. Margarito commanded the bulk of the round, throwing 130punches in the round according to Compubox. Cotto was advocated by his corner in between rounds to stay off the ropes. He obliged, providing lateral movement throughout the round but with approximately 30seconds left, Margarito was able to trap Cotto in a corner, but Cotto managed to escape. It was more of the same in the ninth round, with Cotto going back and forth between southpaw and conventional stance. Margarito continued charging ahead, although Cotto would counterpunch sufficiency to avoid Margarito. The same pattern applied as in the previous two rounds, with Margarito charging forward and Cotto using movement while anticipating chances to counterpunch. Margarito immediately concluded the gap in the final 15seconds, landing a left hook, left uppercut and right hand that had Cotto against the ropes. Halfway through the eleventh round, a left uppercut by Margarito left Cotto vulnerable as he took a knee after Margarito landed a right uppercut and two right hands. Cotto managed to get up, but <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> again, despite Margarito not landing another punch. The referee moved in to count, but Evangelista Cotto, Cotto's trainer and uncle, climbed onto the ring apron and threw in the towel. The official time of the stoppage was 2:05of round eleven.|$|E
25|$|Korchnoi won {{his first}} round 1971 match against GM Efim Geller at Moscow by (+4−1=3), after which <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to defeat in the {{semifinal}} versus GM Tigran Petrosian by (−1=9), also at Moscow, with the ninth game the only decisive result.|$|E

25|$|Emperor loyalist Nitta Yoshisada in 1333 invaded Kamakura, deposing its Regent Hōjō Takatoki {{and ending}} the 145-year old Kamakura shogunate. According to the legend, {{being unable to}} defeat Kamakura {{defenses}} on land, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to Shichirigahama and, at the impassable cape of Inamuragasaki, prayed to the god Ryūjin to withdraw the waves and let him through.|$|E
25|$|Cho won the 8th Kisei title, {{defending}} {{it against}} Rin Kaiho. For {{the fourth time}} in 5 years, Cho faced Otake Hideo in the Meijin final. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> 3 games again, only to win 4 straight games and defend his Meijin for the 5th time. His results would have to be called a success, he failed once more to make the Honinbo League.|$|E
25|$|Leading 24–22, Millsaps got {{the ball}} at the Trinity 43-yard line with 2:03 left in the game. They ran four {{straight}} rushing plays but were unable to run out the clock. On fourth-and-two with eight seconds left, Millsaps backup quarterback Burt Pereira ran to his left {{in an attempt to}} run out the clock; however, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> with two seconds left, which gave Trinity possession of the ball and one final play in which to score.|$|E

25|$|During his {{overnight}} stay at Titusville, Brooks had repaired the aircraft, using a propeller from the forced landing. He had also placed wooden toothpicks in the vent holes {{of the fuel}} cap to prevent moist air from entering and condensing overnight. On February 25, Brooks took off to complete the race, circled out over the Atlantic where his motor quit and <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> off Melbourne, Florida. The wreckage of the Ford Flivver washed up, but Brooks' body was never found.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of those}} aboard {{were killed in}} the impact and sinking, but S-34 then trained a {{searchlight}} on survivors in the water and machine-gunned them. Abukirs Second Officer, Temporary Sub-lieutenant Patrick Wills-Rust RNR, was on the bridge when Abukir was hit. Concrete slabs that had been installed to protect the bridge from machine-gun fire pinned him down and <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> with the ship. However, as the ship settled on the seabed the slabs were dislodged, freeing Wills-Rust and letting him return to the surface.|$|E
25|$|Monday came, all was well. Tuesday came, he not sick. Wednesday came, {{and still}} he was well; with which his impertinent wife did much twit {{him in his}} teeth. Thursday came, and dinner was ended, he very well: <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to the water-side, and took a pair of oars to go to some {{buildings}} he was in hand with in Puddle-dock. Being {{in the middle of}} the Thames, he presently fell down, only saying, 'An impost, an impost,' and so died. A most sad storm of wind immediately following.|$|E

25|$|Collishaw's {{next two}} {{victories}} were properly witnessed {{by thousands of}} French troops. He was ferrying a new aircraft from Wing Headquarters when six enemies dived out of the clouds and attacked him. It was six to one, and the Germans {{had the advantage of}} height. Collishaw, like Barker and McKeever, was happiest when close to the ground in such a spot. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>down.</b> At tree-top level the advantage of numbers meant much less. In two quick bursts, he sent two Albatroses crashing into the trees, after which the others flew off. The flight so impressed the French that they awarded him the Croix de Guerre.|$|E

On February 25, Brooks took off to complete the flight, circled out over the Atlantic where his motor quit and <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> off Melbourne, Florida. The wreckage of the Ford Flivver washed up, but the pilot was never found. Investigation of the wreckage disclosed that the toothpicks had plugged the fuel cap vent holes, causing an engine stoppage.|$|E
25|$|At Kentucky, brief {{controversy}} hit Busch as on lap 48, he {{was responsible}} for causing a seven car wreck that was instigated when <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> on the apron, then came back up the track and turned Brad Keselowski approaching turn 1, causing Keselowski to shoot up the track and collect several more cars including Greg Biffle, Travis Kvapil and Dave Blaney. Busch finished sixth, and followed this up with another sixth-place finish at the Coke Zero 400. This finish gave Furniture Row Racing their first ever streak of three straight top-ten finishes, and also moved Busch up to ninth in the points. However the next week at Loudon, Busch started second and led 102 laps before he was turned and wrecked by Matt Kenseth and finished 31st.|$|E

25|$|During the descent, Captain Cronin ordered Flight Engineer Thomas to {{tell the}} flight attendants to prepare for an {{emergency}} landing, but Thomas was unable to contact them through the intercom. He asked the captain for permission {{to go down to}} find out what was happening, and Cronin agreed. Thomas saw severe damage immediately upon leaving the cockpit; the aircraft's skin was peeled off in some areas on the upper deck, revealing the frames and stringers. As <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to the lower deck, the magnitude of the damage became apparent as he saw the large hole in the side of the cabin. Thomas returned to the cockpit and reported that a large section of fuselage was open aft of the Number 1 exit door. He concluded that it was probably a bomb and that, considering the damage, it would be unwise to exceed the airplane's stall speed by more than a small margin.|$|E
25|$|In 1952 {{he defended}} the title with success against Bobby Dykes, Gil Turner, and with Graham {{in a third}} {{encounter}} between the two. All those fights were won by decision in 15. He also had five non-title bouts, including three that {{were a part of}} an Argentinian tour. His third fight with Graham was his first world title defense in Havana and his fight with Dykes marked {{the first time that a}} black man and a white man had a boxing fight in then-segregated Miami, Florida. In 1953, Gavilan retained the title by a knockout in ten against Chuck Davey, by a decision in 15 against Carmen Basilio and by a decision in 15 against Bratton. He had seven non-title bouts, losing to Danny Womber, but beating Ralph Tiger Jones. In 1954 Gavilan went up in weight. After two more points wins, he challenged world Middleweight champion Bobo Olson for the world title, but lost a decision in 15. Then, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> in weight, and lost his world Welterweight championship, by a decision in 15 to Johnny Saxton. That same year, he appeared on a Telemundo Puerto Rico poster that promoted that country's first television transmission.|$|E
