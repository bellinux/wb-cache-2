5|$|Hazlitt found sheer {{delight in}} A Midsummer Night's Dream, {{especially}} relishing its playfully inventive poetry and quoting at length {{several of his}} favourite passages. He also considers how it exhibits the fine discrimination of character to be found everywhere in Shakespeare. As elsewhere, <b>he</b> <b>crosses</b> <b>the</b> boundaries of plays and enumerates subtle differences between even the fairy characters, in this case in an extensive comparison of Puck in this play and Ariel in The Tempest.|$|E
5|$|He then {{falls asleep}} {{continuing}} {{to play the}} note. A dream sequence of the opening scene of the film Chariots of Fire shows the characters running across a beach, though Mr. Bean dreams he is running with them. He begins to fall behind, until he hails a car to overtake all the others. Now running in front, Bean ensures he wins the race on the beach by tripping one of the runners trying to overtake him, whereupon <b>he</b> <b>crosses</b> <b>the</b> line with elation, and then wakes up. Finding {{that the rest of}} the orchestra have stopped playing while he continued his one recurring note, Bean, with encouragement from Rattle, plays an extended flourish and lastly touches a note that makes a flatulent sound, then stops.|$|E
5|$|The {{woman is}} {{revealed}} to be a genie. Stokes is angry that he wasted his first two wishes; Stokes had previously wished for his boss to stop talking (which caused Gilmore's mouth to disappear) and for a boat. The boat, however, was not placed in water and Stokes is still forced {{to pay taxes on}} it. The genie suggests that Anson should give his physically handicapped brother the ability to walk as his third wish; but he instead wishes for the ability to be turned invisible. Anson, now invisible, runs out into the street and is killed by a truck as <b>he</b> <b>crosses</b> <b>the</b> road.|$|E
50|$|Petrus {{defeated}} the Slavs in 594 near Marcianopolis and maintained the Danube between Novae and the Danube Delta. Later on, <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Danube and fought {{his way to}} the Helibacia river, defeating numerous Slavic tribes in <b>the</b> course. 601, <b>he</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Danube into Avar homeland and {{defeated the}}m in several battles.|$|R

25|$|As <b>he</b> <b>crosses</b> <b>the</b> {{bridge in}} the early morning darkness, the young man meets a group of women leaving the city. They ask him {{questions}} about the outside world and give him a weapon: a bladed “orchid,” worn around the wrist with its blades sweeping {{up in front of the}} hand.|$|E
2500|$|Colin Raimes (Michael Bertolini) — Suspected serial killer. Sam and Maya are {{hunting down}} Raimes for {{kidnapping}} and murdering young women. After a chase and a fight scene, he is apprehended, but released {{because of a}} seemingly solid alibi. Maya trails him {{in the park and}} she is abducted. Sam races to Raimes' apartment, and as <b>he</b> <b>crosses</b> <b>the</b> street, he is hit by a car and wakes up in 1973. [...] When in 1973 (during the first episode of the series), Sam meets Raimes as a child and has thoughts of shooting him so he doesn't {{grow up to be a}} killer; however a message from Maya over the car radio tells Sam that she's alive and safe; Sam puts his gun away and lets Colin return home. [...] His BBC counterpart is Colin Raimes (Sam Hazeldine).|$|E
2500|$|At the show's outset in 2008, he cohabits {{with his}} girlfriend who is also his NYPD {{assigned}} partner, Detective Maya Daniels. Maya, to Tyler's horror, is kidnapped by a murderer they are investigating. While responding to a radio call as <b>he</b> <b>crosses</b> <b>the</b> street, Tyler is distracted and hit by another responding speeding police car. He regains consciousness {{in the same spot}} in the year 1973, dressed in period civilian attire, carrying a period-accurate identity card with his badge, and equipped with a vintage automobile, a 1971 Chevrolet Chevelle — and, astonishingly, he's parked within sight of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. He returns to his precinct house to find an unfamiliar early-1970s police squad, with contemporary equipment and culture which he likens to finding himself on a different planet. However, the detectives have been expecting him, thinking that he is a transfer from a place called [...] "Hyde". His disorientation and frequent reference to things from the future brand him as eccentric, being labeled with the nickname [...] "Spaceman", but he becomes a valued member of the squad.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the final}} day of term Jonah returns to Summer Heights High to read his story he made to Gumnut Cottage, where he claims that all Summer Heights High {{teachers}} are gay except for Ms Palmer, who is awesome. He promises to read books every day back in Tonga. He also shakes Doug Peterson's hand and calls him a good bloke. When he sees Keiran, his friends want to bully him but he refuses with [...] "Why {{do you want to do}} that?" [...] This suggests that he has reached a level of maturity and acceptance—until we are shown that he has placed his graffiti tag, [...] "DICK"tation, on various student and staff belongings like Keiran's backpack, Miss Wheatley's office door, and every vehicle in the faculty carpark in silver spray-paint. As a final farewell, he places a mural-sized [...] "DICK"tation on the roof closest to the school entrance, and we see him walking away with his friends for the last time, insulting a driver as <b>he</b> <b>crosses</b> <b>the</b> road and then further agitating that driver by breakdancing with Leon in the road.|$|E

(<b>He</b> <b>crosses</b> <b>the</b> {{room to the}} fireplace, protesting as he goes, {{and knocks}} the ashes out of his pipe on the bars.

60|$|The Sergeant returns {{ushering}} {{a handsome}} strongly built young English {{officer in the}} uniform of a Light Dragoon. He is evidently on fairly good terms with himself, and very sure of his social position. <b>He</b> <b>crosses</b> <b>the</b> room {{to the end of}} the table opposite Patiomkin's, and awaits the civilities of that statesman with confidence. The Sergeant remains prudently at the door.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>crosses</b> <b>the</b> {{kitchen to}} the oak chest and sits sulkily on it. Mrs Bridgenorth shrugs her {{shoulders}} and {{sits at the table}} in Reginald's neighborhood listening in placid helplessness. Lesbia, out of patience with Leo's tears, goes into the garden and sits there near the door, snuffing up the open air in her relief from the domestic stuffness of Reginald's affairs.|$|E
