Active regeneration happens while the vehicle is not in use and takes 10 minutes on average to complete. Passive regeneration takes place while driving using {{the heat of the}} exhaust. This works well for vehicles that drive longer distances with few stops compared to those that perform short trips with many starts and stops. If the filter develops too much pressure then the last type of regeneration must be used - a forced regeneration. This involves a garage using a computer program to run the car, initiating a regeneration of the DPF manually.|$|E

A main optimization option is the retrofit of demandbased control {{strategies in the}} supply system. The study {{of the state of}} the art shows that a high energy saving potential remains in central precoat filter systems for coolant cleaning. The achievable flow rate through the precoat filter with the filter pump is reduced in filter operation due to the rising filter resistance. The precoat filters in the filter system need to be regenerated as soon as the achievable flow rate through the filters falls below a certain level. So far the filter pumps are throttled and operated constantly with maximum speed since this allows triggering the regeneration based on the <b>filter</b> <b>pressure.</b> Thereby the filter systems are operated constantly on an excessive power level, independent on the coolant demand. Within this thesis, an automation procedure for an energy efficient operation of central precoat filter systems is presented. The flow rates through the filters are regulated demand-based with a follow-up control using variable speed pumps. Thereby the energy intake is adapted based on the current coolant demand. The <b>filter</b> <b>pressure</b> is no longer utilizable to trigger the filter regeneration due to the variation of the flow rate. Therefore the <b>filter</b> <b>pressure</b> which would arise in uncontrolled operation is reconstructed in controlled operation with measured variables using a model.

This study: (i) developed a new methodology for simulating filter loading in-situ; (ii) observed the impact of filter loading on AC performance in-situ; and (iii) provided a greater understanding of when a filter is “dirty” and should be replaced. Six central AC systems in the Atlanta metro-region were evaluated.

40|$|In {{dual fuel}} engines {{operating}} on gas mode knock {{represents one of}} the major constraints on performance and efficiency, because it limits the maximum value of the engine compression ratio and of the boost pressure. The detection of abnormal combustion onset and the evaluation of knock intensity is therefore a crucial issue in engine development. In this work two different categories of knock detection methods, based both on frequency domain manipulations of the cylinder pressure signal and on cylinder head vibration analysis, were extensively compared through an experimental investigation carried out on a Wartsila W 50 DF engine. After a detailed literary review, the following three knock indicators were chosen to be examined through the experimental analysis: • maximum peak to peak value of the band-pass <b>filtered</b> <b>pressure</b> or vibration signal; • mean square value of the band-pass <b>filtered</b> <b>pressure</b> or vibration signal; • integral of the absolute value of the first derivative of band-pass <b>filtered</b> <b>pressure</b> or vibration signal. Different criteria for the identification of knocking cycles were evaluated, based on the comparison of the individual cycle knock indicator level with a constant threshold or on a statistical approach. While constant threshold approach was shown to be suitable for in cylinder pressure methods at constant engine load and speed (as for genset applications), the use of a statistical approach appeared to be mandatory for a fixed propeller pitch engine applications. Moreover the statistical approach {{turned out to be more}} reliable and robust in case of use of vibration based methods and therefore more suitable for the implementation on mass-produced engines. Finally, by means of a proper choice of filtering frequencies and of the accelerometer position, the influence of the engine transfer function on the vibration signal was remarkably reduced, thus allowing an easier and more reliable detection of knocking cycles, as well as a ranking of knocking cycles on the base of their intensity, thus paving the way to future finer engine control strategies developmen...|$|R

40|$|A Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) {{database}} {{was created}} representing mixing of species under high-pressure conditions. The configuration considered {{is that of}} a temporally evolving mixing layer. The database was examined and analyzed for the purpose of modeling some of the unclosed terms that appear in the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) equations. Several metrics are used to understand the LES modeling requirements. First, a statistical analysis of the DNS-database large-scale flow structures was performed to provide a metric for probing the accuracy of the proposed LES models as the flow fields obtained from accurate LESs should contain structures of morphology statistically similar to those observed in the filtered-and-coarsened DNS (FC-DNS) fields. To characterize the morphology of the large-scales structures, the Minkowski functionals of the iso-surfaces were evaluated for two different fields: the second-invariant of the rate of deformation tensor and the irreversible entropy production rate. To remove the presence of the small flow scales, both of these fields were computed using the FC-DNS solutions. It was found that the large-scale structures of the irreversible entropy production rate exhibit higher morphological complexity than those of the second invariant of the rate of deformation tensor, indicating that the burden of modeling will be on recovering the thermodynamic fields. Second, to evaluate the physical effects which must be modeled at the subfilter scale, an a priori analysis was conducted. This a priori analysis, conducted in the coarse-grid LES regime, revealed that standard closures for the <b>filtered</b> <b>pressure,</b> the <b>filtered</b> heat flux, and the filtered species mass fluxes, in which a filtered function of a variable is equal to the function of the filtered variable, may no longer be valid for the high-pressure flows considered in this study. The terms requiring modeling are the <b>filtered</b> <b>pressure,</b> the <b>filtered</b> heat flux, the <b>filtered</b> <b>pressure</b> work, and the filtered species mass fluxes. Improved models were developed based on a scale-similarity approach and were found to perform considerably better than the classical ones. These improved models were also assessed in an a posteriori study. Different combinations of the standard models and the improved ones were tested. At the relatively small Reynolds numbers achievable in DNS and at the relatively small filter widths used here, the standard models for the <b>filtered</b> <b>pressure,</b> the <b>filtered</b> heat flux, and the filtered species fluxes were found to yield accurate results for the morphology of the large-scale structures present in the flow. Analysis of the temporal evolution of several volume-averaged quantities representative of the mixing layer growth, and of the cross-stream variation of homogeneous-plane averages and second-order correlations, as well as of visualizations, indicated that the models performed equivalently for the conditions of the simulations. The expectation is that at the much larger Reynolds numbers and much larger filter widths used in practical applications, the improved models will have much more accurate performance than the standard one...|$|R

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of soot and lubrication-derived ash particles in a {{diesel particulate filter}} (DPF) increases exhaust flow restriction and negatively impacts engine efficiency. Previous studies have described the macroscopic phenomenon and general effects of soot and ash accumulation on <b>filter</b> <b>pressure</b> drop. In order to enhance the fundamental understanding, this study utilized a novel apparatus, that of a dual beam scanning electron microscope (SEM) and focused ion beam (FIB), to investigate microscopic details of soot and ash accumulation in the DPF. Specifically, FIB provides a minimally invasive technique to analyze the interactions between the soot, ash, catalyst/washcoat, and DPF substrate {{with a high degree}} of measurement resolution. The FIB utilizes a gallium liquid metal ion source which produces Ga+ ions of sufficient momentum to directionally mill away material from the soot, ash, and substrate layers on a nm-μm scale. As the FIB cuts into the sample, uncovering intra-layer details, the coupled high resolution SEM imaging and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis provide both morphological and chemical data. This tool was applied to investigate soot and ash accumulation in the DPF, with a specific focus on characterizing interactions between the soot/ash/DPF interfaces, such as soot penetration into the ash layer, as well as soot and ash accumulation in the DPF surface pores. In particular, ash and soot particle size, layer pore structure, and the extent of penetration or intra-layer mixing, are all parameters directly impacting DPF pressure drop, which may be quantified using this technique. The work in this study leveraged existing databases of aged DPFs containing various levels of soot and ash, originating from field trials and controlled laboratory testing.

In the context of large-eddy simulations, the exact filtered equation of state (EoS) is generally approximated by an EoS directly computed from the Favre filtered quantities for species mass fractions and temperature. The soundness of this approximation is presently addressed through the analysis of laminar CH 4 -air and CH 4 -O- 2 high-pressure premixed and non-premixed flames. Their computations were performed either with the ideal gas equation of state (EoS) or with a high-pressure package that gather a cubic EoS along with additional pressure-dependent transport parameters and thermodynamic relations. Various kinetic schemes are used for the computation of laminar premixed flames and a comparison with available experimental data is provided for flame speed (S-L). Laminar premixed CH 4 -O- 2 flames exhibit micro metric flame thickness for pressures above 2. 0 MPa as well as a high flame temperature (3000 K). These flamelets were then filtered either with a Gaussian filter or through a beta-pdf technique. The resulting filtered profiles were used to approximate the <b>filtered</b> <b>pressure,</b> (p) over barT. A negligible error is observed for CH 4 -air flames when comparing (p) over bar with the exact <b>filtered</b> <b>pressure.</b> However, significant errors were found for high-pressure CH 4 -O- 2 flames, that increase with the filter size. This behaviour is exacerbated for transcritical injections meaning that classical techniques that use tabulated thermochemistry methods in compressible codes must be revisited in that context. A correction to the tabulated chemistry approach coupled to a presumed subgrid pdf is finally proposed to comply with high-pressure considerations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
