2500|$|Norman Rockwell was a {{prolific}} artist, producing more than 4,000 original works in his lifetime. Most {{of his works}} are either in public collections, or have been destroyed in fire or other misfortunes. Rockwell also was commissioned to illustrate more than 40 books, including Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn as well as painting the portraits for Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon, {{as well as those}} of foreign figures, including Gamal Abdel Nasser and Jawaharlal Nehru. His portrait subjects included Judy Garland. One of his last portraits was of Colonel Sanders in 1973. His annual contributions for the Boy Scouts calendars between 1925 and 1976 (Rockwell was a 1939 recipient of the Silver Buffalo Award, the highest adult award given by the Boy Scouts of America), were only slightly overshadowed by his most popular of calendar works: the [...] "Four Seasons" [...] illustrations for Brown & Bigelow that were published for 17 years beginning in 1947 and reproduced in various styles and sizes since 1964. He painted six images for Coca-Cola advertising. Illustrations <b>for</b> <b>booklets,</b> catalogs, posters (particularly movie promotions), sheet music, stamps, playing cards, and murals (including [...] "Yankee Doodle Dandy" [...] and [...] "God Bless the Hills", which was completed in 1936 for the Nassau Inn in Princeton, New Jersey) rounded out Rockwell's œuvre as an illustrator.|$|E

50|$|From {{that time}} all {{machines}} {{in use in}} the UK were of the electro-mechanical type. This used a standard mechanical coin-weigher unit and mechanical stacking <b>for</b> <b>booklets,</b> but had an electronic arm on a rotating cam for dispensing the booklets. They were manufactured by Hillday Automation of Attleborough, Norfolk and designated Type B52. Two versions were built with either long or short coin boxes, easily recognised from {{the length of the}} case. Initially set to dispense 4 x 25p stamps in a folded booklet in exchange for a £1 coin, different combinations were later employed as postage rates in the UK continued to rise.|$|E

50|$|White's {{introduction}} to wood engraving came in 1920. Hitherto {{he had worked}} largely in water colour. In 1920 Cyril Beaumont, for whom he had produced designs <b>for</b> <b>booklets</b> on the Russian ballet (L'Oiseau de Feu, The Three Cornered Hat, Thamar and Impressions of the Russian Ballet, all 1919) and two limited editions (Eclogues, a Book of Poems 1919 and The Smile of the Sphinx 1920), asked him to produce colour wood engravings for an edition of W.W. Gibson's Home for his Beaumont Press. White then started to produce independent wood engravings {{very much in the}} modern style advocated by Noel Rooke. These were unusually large in scale.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical errors {{during the}} process of {{production}} can result in tête-bêches. During the printing of stamps <b>for</b> <b>booklets,</b> the pages of stamps are usually printed in multiples from a larger printing plate. This can result in tête-bêche pairs. It is unusual for these pairs to find their way into the postal system, as they are cut into individual booklet pages before binding into the distributed booklet. A block of 24 5d Machin stamps, which should have been guillotined into four booklet pages, includes four tête-bêche pairs. This was sold in 1970, in the normal course of business, by the British Post Office and is exhibited {{by a member of the}} Royal Mail Stamp Advisory Committee.|$|E
50|$|On {{arriving}} in Toronto in 1966, Harris began {{working closely with}} bpNichol on various text and sound projects. He participated in {{the founding of the}} concrete poetry magazine grOnk with David Aylward, bpNichol and Rah Smith. At this time he began exhibiting his visual poetry and collage worldwide, achieving some acclaim. Harris adopted the pseudonym David UU around 1970. In Vancouver in 1973 he helped organize Brasilia 73, an international concrete poetry show. He was a prolific publisher and encouraged the talents of many Canadian writers early in their careers. He founded and operated Fleye Press (1966-70), Divine Order of the Lodge (1971-1975), Derwyddon Press (1976-81), Silver Birch Press (1987-94; later MindWare) as well as several magazines (Spanish Fleye & Luv for Poemz from Fleye Press in the mid'6os & Lodgistiks from Derwyddon Press in the '7os) and numerous imprints <b>for</b> <b>booklets,</b> pamphlets, broadsides, postcards and other ephemera.|$|E

50|$|Originally {{booklets}} {{were produced}} manually, by separating sheets into smaller panes and binding those. These are not distinguishable from the sheet stamps. Later, {{the popularity of}} booklets meant that it was worthwhile to produce booklet panes directly; printing onto large sheets, then cutting into booklet panes each with {{a small number of}} stamps, and perforating between the stamps of each pane. Such sheets, in fact, were created to produce the earliest United States booklets, printed from special plates that yielded sheets of 180 or 360 stamps for cutting into panes of six stamps each. (Normal sheets containing 400 stamps were deemed unusable <b>for</b> <b>booklets</b> because they could not be cut into six-stamp panes without leaving waste.) Booklet stamps so produced usually have 1, 2, or 3 straight edges (although some booklet panes have been printed 3 stamps across, and the middle stamps will have perforations all around). The first two U. S. booklet issues (1900 and 1903) offered only stamps denominated at the normal letter rate (2¢), but in 1907 booklets were introduced containing 1¢ stamps suitable for post cards.|$|E

40|$|A booklet was {{developed}} in the author's practice that provided advice for parents on the home management of cough, fever, sore throat, diarrhoea and vomiting in children, and included specific recommendations about when to seek medical help. The effect of distributing this booklet on the frequency of parent-initiated consultations was evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial. The overall effect of the booklet was a statistically non-significant reduction in consultations for the symptoms that it addressed ('booklet symptoms'). However, this finding masked a statistically significant reduction in daytime home visits <b>for</b> <b>booklet</b> symptoms (especially <b>for</b> cough, fever and sore throat) and a significant increase in out of hours consultations (for fever, diarrhoea and vomiting). Had all the households in the practice been sent a copy of the booklet then it was estimated that over the following year some 28 % fewer home visits and some 173 % more out of hours consultations would have been undertaken <b>for</b> <b>booklet</b> symptoms than if none of the households had been sent a copy...|$|R
