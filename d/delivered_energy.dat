25|$|One of {{the last}} steps in the process before {{reaching}} the target chamber is to convert the infrared (IR) light at 1053nm into the ultraviolet (UV) at 351nm in a device known as a frequency converter. These are made of thin sheets (about 1cm thick) cut from a single crystal of potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When the 1053nm (IR) light passes through {{the first of two}} of these sheets, frequency addition converts a large fraction of the light into 527nm light (green). On passing through the second sheet, frequency combination converts much of the 527nm light and the remaining 1053nm light into 351nm (UV) light. IR light is much less effective than UV at heating the targets, because IR couples more strongly with hot electrons which will absorb a considerable amount of energy and interfere with compression. The conversion process can reach peak efficiencies of about 80 percent for a laser pulse that has a flat temporal shape, but the temporal shape needed for ignition varies significantly over the duration of the pulse. The actual conversion process is about 50 percent efficient, reducing <b>delivered</b> <b>energy</b> to a nominal 1.8MJ.|$|E

50|$|Photoacoustic imaging (optoacoustic imaging) is a {{biomedical}} imaging modality {{based on the}} photoacoustic effect. In photoacoustic imaging, non-ionizing laser pulses are delivered into biological tissues (when radio frequency pulses are used, the technology {{is referred to as}} thermoacoustic imaging). Some of the <b>delivered</b> <b>energy</b> will be absorbed and converted into heat, leading to transient thermoelastic expansion and thus wideband (i.e. MHz) ultrasonic emission. The generated ultrasonic waves are detected by ultrasonic transducers and then analyzed to produce images. It is known that optical absorption is closely associated with physiological properties, such as hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation. As a result, the magnitude of the ultrasonic emission (i.e. photoacoustic signal), which is proportional to the local energy deposition, reveals physiologically specific optical absorption contrast. 2D or 3D images of the targeted areas can then be formed. Fig. 1 is a schematic illustration showing the basic principles of photoacoustic imaging.|$|E

The crude drug âbu-shi â or âcho-ohâ, which is obtained from the Aconitum roots, contains the potent poisons aconitine, mesaconitine, jesaconitine, and hypaconitine, which are C 19 diterpenoid ester alkaloids. These alkaloids have been known to induce fatal cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. In ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, cardioversion/defibrillation are the most effective treatment of choice to terminate reentrant arrhythmias.

40|$|This Final Technical Report {{discusses}} {{the progress that}} was made on the experimental and numerical tasks over the duration of this project. The primary objectives of the project were to (1) develop an improved understanding of the spark ignition process, and (2) develop the railplug as an improved ignitor for large bore stationary natural gas engines. We performed fundamental experiments on the physical processes occurring during spark ignition and used the results from these experiments to aid our development of the most complete model of the spark ignition process ever devised. The elements in this model include (1) the dynamic response of the ignition circuit, (2) a chemical kinetics mechanism that is suitable for the reactions {{that occur in the}} plasma, (3) conventional flame propagation kinetics, and (4) a multi-dimensional formulation so that bulk flow through the spark gap can be incorporated. This model (i. e., a Fortran code that {{can be used as a}} subroutine within an engine modeling code such as KIVA) can be obtained from Prof. Ron Matthews at rdmatt{at}mail. utexas. edu or Prof. DK Ezekoye at dezekoye{at}mail. utexas. edu. Fundamental experiments, engine experiments, and modeling tasks were used to help develop the railplug as a new ignitor for large bore natural gas engines. As the result of these studies, we developed a railplug that could extend the Lean Stability Limit (LSL) of an engine operating at full load on natural gas from {phi} = 0. 59 for operation on spark plugs down to {phi} = 0. 53 using railplugs with the same <b>delivered</b> <b>energy</b> (0. 7 J). However, this <b>delivered</b> <b>energy</b> would rapidly wear out the spark plug. For a conventional <b>delivered</b> <b>energy</b> (< 0. 05 J), the LSL is {phi} = 0. 63 for a spark plug. Further, using a permanent magnet to aid the plasma movement, the LSL was extended to {phi} = 0. 54 for a railplug with a <b>delivered</b> <b>energy</b> of only 0. 15 J/shot, a typical discharge energy for commercial capacitive discharge ignition systems. Here, it should be noted that railplugs and the associated ignition circuit should not cost much more than a conventional spark ignition system. Additionally, it is believed that the railplug performance can be further improved via continued research and development...|$|E
