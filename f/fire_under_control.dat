25|$|On {{the morning}} of 21 May 2007, Cutty Sark, which had been closed and partly {{dismantled}} for conservation work, caught fire, and burned for several hours before the London Fire Brigade could bring the <b>fire</b> <b>under</b> <b>control.</b> Initial reports indicated that the damage was extensive, {{with most of the}} wooden structure in the centre having been lost.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 9 June 1979, a fire broke out inside the ride at {{approximately}} 10:15 pm. Due {{to a combination of}} low water pressure, under-staffing within the park, and inadequate coverage of the Ghost Train by the park's fire hose system, the fire was able to completely consume the ride. It took an hour to bring the <b>fire</b> <b>under</b> <b>control,</b> but it was extinguished before any significant damage could be done to the adjacent River Caves and Big Dipper.|$|E
25|$|Flyer's {{career was}} almost ended at midnight on 14 June 1892, by a fire which started {{when she was}} taking on wood for fuel at the Commercial Dock in Seattle. Within five minutes the fire had swept through the vessel. The fireboat Snoqualmie and all {{available}} units of the Seattle fire department, under Chief Gardner Kellogg, responded to the fire. They {{were able to get}} the <b>fire</b> <b>under</b> <b>control</b> before serious damage was done to the hull or machinery. However, all of the vessel's upper works were destroyed. Flyer was quickly rebuilt and returned to service {{by the end of the}} summer of 1892. She made four daily round-trips between Seattle and Tacoma.|$|E
50|$|On October 12, 2008, nearby Angel Island, a state park, {{was struck}} by serious brush fires.Fireboat Tiburon {{was one of the}} nearby fireboats which helped bring those <b>fires</b> <b>under</b> <b>control.</b>|$|R

25|$|Between 17:45 and 18:00 on 9 February 1942, {{authorities}} {{considered the}} <b>fire</b> <b>under</b> <b>control,</b> and began winding down operations until 20:00. Water entering the ship through submerged openings and flowing {{to the lower}} decks negated efforts to counter-flood, and Lafayettes list gradually increased to port. Shortly after midnight, Rear Adm. Andrews ordered Lafayette abandoned, and the ship continued to list, a process hastened by the 6,000 tons of water that had been played on her. New York fire officials were concerned that the fire could spread to the nearby city buildings. Lafayette eventually capsized during the mid watch (02:45) on 10 February, nearly crushing a fire boat, and {{came to rest on}} her port side at an angle of approximately 80 degrees. Recognising that his incompetence had caused the disaster, Admiral Andrews ordered all pressmen barred from viewing the moment of capsize in an effort to lower the level of publicity.|$|E
25|$|Just after 01:00, 3 April, the Japanese {{commenced}} a {{long day}} of aerial resistance. At 01:42, Prichett, having beaten off several attacks, was closed by two bogies. The first veered off, but the second pressed on and dropped a 500-pound bomb on the fantail. Exploding close under the counter, it holed the destroyer below the waterline, causing flooding aft and a fire in the 20 mm. clipping room. The crippled destroyer, maintaining a speed in excess of 28knots to minimize flooding and bringing the <b>fire</b> <b>under</b> <b>control,</b> remained in the area and continued to ward off enemy planes until relieved shortly before noon. She then retired to Kerama Retto for emergency repairs. On the 7th, she got underway for Guam where repairs were completed, and on 7 May she returned to Okinawa and radar picket duties. For almost 3 months she escaped further serious damage. However, on 29 July, while standing by a kamikaze victimshe became the target of a second suicide-minded Japanese pilot. Prichett took him under fire at 5,000 yards, but he bore on. Splashed into the sea approximately 6feet off the destroyer's port side, his mission was partially accomplished as his lethal cargo exploded on impact, bowing in the ship's hull and causing extensive damage to her superstructure, port depth charge racks, and radio and power leads. Prichett, despite her damage, remained in the area and for another two hours continued to pick up survivors from Callaghan.|$|E
500|$|On October 7, 1960 Edward M. Cotter {{came to the}} aid of {{firefighting}} {{authorities in}} Port Colborne, Ontario, Canada. Two days previously, on October 5, 1960, a set of grain elevators caught fire at the eight-story Maple Leaf Milling Company. The Port Colborne Fire Department did not have its own fireboat and they were unable to bring the <b>fire</b> <b>under</b> <b>control.</b> The Buffalo Fire Department was asked to send Edward M. Cotter to lend assistance. Escorted by a United States Coast Guard cutter, because she had never needed navigational equipment of her own, Edward M. Cotter proceeded across the international border. [...] The voyage to Port Colborne took two hours with an additional four hours needed to bring the <b>fire</b> <b>under</b> <b>control.</b> This mission {{is said to have been}} the first instance that a United States fire boat had crossed an international border to help authorities in another country.|$|E

50|$|A bushfire near Port Lincoln in South Australia {{destroyed}} {{two houses}} {{and several other}} buildings on 13 January. The <b>fire</b> was brought <b>under</b> <b>control</b> by midday on the 14th. The fire was driven by high temperatures (43 degrees Celsius; 109 degrees Fahrenheit) and strong north-westerly winds. A total of 260 ha was burned by the <b>fire,</b> brought <b>under</b> <b>control</b> thanks to milder conditions on 14 January.|$|R
5000|$|Fire-fighters {{managed to}} bring the <b>fires</b> <b>under</b> <b>control</b> by 1 December while all fires had been {{extinguished}} by 3 December. Angolan and Western oil officials claimed that if the attack had been successful, the city of Luanda would have taken damage from the explosion {{and the release of}} poison chemicals. [...] Brave refinery workers had managed to remove lead tetrachloride, which the South Africans did not know about, from the tanks before the flames got to them.|$|R
500|$|In January 1937, El Occidente {{issued a}} {{distress}} call {{while she was}} in the Gulf of Mexico. After she reported a fire while some [...] south of the mouth of the Mississippi River, U.S. Coast Guard cutters [...] and [...] and German freighter Leubeck all responded to the call. Before any reached the burning vessel, El Occidente reported that she had gotten the <b>fire</b> <b>under</b> <b>control</b> and needed no further assistance. El Occidente headed to Galveston. The following month, El Occidente issued another distress call, this time for a broken rudder while [...] off the Virginia Capes. Coast Guard cutter [...] responded and towed El Occidente to Norfolk, delivering her there on 7 February.|$|E
500|$|The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department {{initially}} sent four vehicles. Personnel {{in these}} vehicles reported that snow and fog hampered their visibility while {{heading to the}} crash site, and they {{could not see the}} destroyed aircraft. However, one member of the fire crew observed people standing on top of a dike near the crash site. Police divers also entered the water following the crash, although they found no-one alive inside the jet or in the water. The fire-fighters continued spraying the fire, and the incident commander estimated that they had the <b>fire</b> <b>under</b> <b>control</b> ten minutes after their arrival at the scene. The New York Times reported that: ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1860s the {{annexation}} of Roxbury to Boston was discussed, and Gaston, {{who supported the}} idea, {{was appointed to the}} Roxbury commission that evaluated the idea in 1867. [...] He ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the United States Congress in 1870. [...] The next year he was elected Mayor of Boston, serving two one-year terms. [...] The most notable event of his tenure as mayor, the Great Boston Fire of 1872, occurred late in the second term. [...] The fire destroyed a large swath of the commercial district of the city, and Gaston was criticized for failing to show decisive leadership during attempts to bring the <b>fire</b> <b>under</b> <b>control.</b> [...] This weak showing, combined with a poor response to a smallpox epidemic in the city, contributed to his loss in a bid for a third term.|$|E
50|$|In April 2007, {{the largest}} wild fire in Georgia history, the Bugaboo Scrub Fire {{started in the}} nearby Okefenokee Swamp. Kingsland was {{blanketed}} in smoke until the <b>fire</b> came <b>under</b> <b>control.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Lexingtons {{damage control}} parties brought the <b>fires</b> <b>under</b> <b>control,</b> {{and the ship}} {{was still able to}} {{continue}} flight operations despite the damage. The air battle itself ended shortly before noon on the 8th; within an hour, the carrier was on an even keel, although slightly down by the bow. However, an explosion caused by the ignition of gasoline vapors later caused a fire and tore apart the inside. Lexington was abandoned at 17:07, and later sunk by the destroyer [...]|$|R
5000|$|... {{took the}} first hit, and as her flight and hangar decks blazed, Suwannee was attacked. Antiaircraft fire from that CVE scored on the planes, which then dived toward Sangamon. A 5"/127mm shell from Suwannee {{finished}} one plane only 50 yd from Sangamon. By 07:55, [...] had joined the fight, and - as Santees crew brought her <b>fires</b> <b>under</b> <b>control</b> — sent a torpedo into that luckless CVE. Minutes later, Suwannee {{was hit by a}} Zero forward of the after elevator.|$|R
2500|$|In Gibraltar in January 1917 Magdalenas {{armament}} was augmented with 45 {{boxes of}} type [...] "E" [...] smoke canisters, {{designed to create}} a smoke screen {{in the event of}} enemy attack. On 29 May 1918 the ship was berthed at Suez when the canisters caught fire. The fire took hold on the port side of the ship, and fire floats came alongside and eventually brought the <b>fire</b> <b>under</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{curtains}} rose while backstage personnel {{hastened to}} bring the <b>fire</b> <b>under</b> <b>control,</b> the actors beginning the scene. After speaking a few lines, Claxton was {{made aware of the}} fire by Lillian Cleaves, another actress backstage who was standing behind the box set. She whispered sotto voce through the canvas of the boathouse that there was fire on stage and urged them to leave. Kate Claxton recalled peering up through the flimsy canvas of the box set and seeing “sparks falling and little tongues of the fire licking the edges of the drops and borders that hung in the flies.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, {{there was}} a fire on board Wave Victor whilst she was {{anchored}} off Greenock, Renfrewshire. On 17 January 1954, Wave Victor was sailing down the Bristol Channel when a fire broke out in the engine room. The fire was reported at 17:24, and five minutes later was stated to be [...] "out of control". At 17:37 a message was broadcast by radio that the ship was to be abandoned. Several tugs and lifeboats, as well as the corvette [...] came out to the ship, but by then the fire was raging out of control and the crew abandoned her, fearing the explosion of her bunkers. The tug Nirumand brought six firemen from Swansea to the ship, which was [...] off Bull Point, Devon. Acting Chief Engineer George McBain remained aboard so the vessel could not be claimed by private tugs under marine salvage laws. The ship continued to drift, and after some time several of the crew and a fire fighting team re-boarded her and brought the <b>fire</b> <b>under</b> <b>control.</b> The fire was extinguished by 12:00 the next day. She was subsequently towed back to Swansea, and then to Wallsend on Tyne to be repaired.|$|E
50|$|On March 17, 2012, Ever Gotesco Grand Central Mall in Caloocan {{burned down}} in a devastating fire which raged for more than 20 hours. The mall closed down after <b>fire</b> brought <b>under</b> <b>control.</b>|$|R
5000|$|At 14:54, {{a single}} Aichi B7A1 [...] "Grace" [...] carrier attack plane dove over Hank, passed across the formation, and, despite {{withering}} anti-aircraft fire, banked around {{to crash into}} Borie. Large fires broke out immediately, especially in her forward superstructure around the bridge; and the three other destroyers {{spent the next two}} hours fending off four more enemy attacks. After Bories damage control teams got the <b>fires</b> <b>under</b> <b>control,</b> Benner spent a fruitless evening searching the water for Borie crewmen lost over the side.|$|R

50|$|On 27 October 1917 {{much of the}} town's {{business}} district was destroyed by fire. The fire had started in the Andrew's Hotel {{on the corner of}} High and Station Streets at about 2pm. Flames blew across the road engulfing the Dannevirke Co-operative Association's store. As the fire spread through adjoining shops another hotel, the Masonic was engulfed. By about 5pm the Dannevirke and Woodville Fire Brigades, along with assistance from the local community had brought the <b>fires</b> <b>under</b> <b>control.</b> In total 27 business premises and 2 hotels were destroyed with damage estimated at ₤200,000.|$|R

50|$|The {{next day}} her task group {{underwent}} a severe air attack. Cowanesque fired at several planes and shot down {{at least two}} before a single-engine fighter crashed into her port side and disintegrated violently (believed to be a kamikaze attack), spreading burning gasoline over the deck. Damage control parties dumped the unexploded bomb from the plane over the side, brought the <b>fires</b> <b>under</b> <b>control</b> and repaired the damage enabling Cowanesque to continue her mission. Her casualties were two dead, two wounded. Cowanesque fueled ships at Mindoro, Lingayen Gulf, and San Pedro Bay until 25 February when she sailed for Ulithi.|$|R
