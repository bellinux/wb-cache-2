Speaking of this loss, then-NBC president Warren Littlefield said, at odds with NBC's earlier denial of possible revenue loss being a factor in its scheduling decision, [...] "There are few things in broadcasting that we know for sure, {{and one of those}} is that when you do an episode of any series that deals with AIDS, {{there is going to be}} advertiser sensitivity to it.
