5|$|Only about 6% of {{the salt}} {{manufactured}} {{in the world is}} used in food. Of the remainder, 12% is used in water conditioning processes, 8% goes for de-icing highways and 6% is used in agriculture. The rest (68%) is used for manufacturing and other industrial processes, and sodium chloride {{is one of the largest}} inorganic raw materials used by volume. Its major chemical products are caustic soda and chlorine, which are separated by the electrolysis of a pure brine solution. These are used in the manufacture of PVC, plastics, paper pulp and many other inorganic and organic compounds. Salt is also used as a flux in the production of aluminium. For this purpose, a layer of melted salt floats on top of the molten metal and removes iron and other metal contaminants. It is also used in the manufacture of soaps and glycerine, where it is added to the vat to precipitate out the saponified products. As an <b>emulsifier,</b> salt is used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber, and another use is in the firing of pottery, when salt added to the furnace vaporises before condensing onto the surface of the ceramic material, forming a strong glaze.|$|E

40|$|The {{oxidative}} {{stability of}} polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and soybean oil homogenized with <b>emulsifiers</b> was investigated. Model emulsions were prepared from PUFA, including linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and from soybean oil emulsified with different emulsifiers: three Tween <b>emulsifiers</b> (Tween 20, Tween 60, Tween 80) and two sucrose esters (S- 1170 and S- 1570) were used. The {{results showed that}} the emulsions prepared from LA and the various <b>emulsifiers,</b> oxidized at 40 degrees C, were unstable. However, the corresponding AA, EPA, and DHA emulsions were stable, indicating that PUFA with a higher degree of unsaturation were more stable with <b>emulsifiers</b> than without the <b>emulsifiers.</b> In the soybean oil-in-water model system, the oxidation of soybean oil with various <b>emulsifiers</b> was less than without the <b>emulsifiers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background The {{evidence}} on the safety of topical preparations containing <b>emulsifiers</b> is limited. Objectives The aims {{of the study were}} to assess (1) the prevalence of sensitization to some <b>emulsifiers</b> commonly found in topical products, (2) the sensitization to <b>emulsifiers</b> in relation to sex, age, and predisposing factors, and (3) the frequency of concomitant sensitization to other common allergens. Methods All consecutive patients presenting to the Allergy Unit of our Dermatological Department for allergological investigation were enrolled. All patients were patch tested with the Italian Società Italiana di Dermatologia Allergologica Professionale ed Ambientale baseline series and an additional <b>emulsifiers</b> series. Doubtful patch test reactions were not considered. Results Of 310 patients, 50 (16 %) were sensitized to <b>emulsifiers</b> with 72 positive reactions. Lauryl polyethylene glycol/polypropylene glycol- 18 / 18 methicone gave 26 positive reactions, glyceryl oleate 19, myristyl alcohol, and Amerchol L 101 11. Concomitant sensitization to <b>emulsifiers</b> was found in 16 patients. Patients allergic to <b>emulsifiers</b> showed concomitant allergic reactions to allergens commonly found in cosmetics. No significant differences by sex, age, atopic diathesis, and clinical pattern at presentation were noticed. Conclusions Contact allergy to <b>emulsifiers</b> is more frequent than reported. Patients allergic to <b>emulsifiers</b> show frequent positive patch tests to other constituents of cosmetics and topical products...|$|R
50|$|<b>Emulsifiers</b> : <b>Emulsifiers</b> allow {{water and}} oils to remain mixed {{together}} in an emulsion, as in mayonnaise, ice cream, and homogenized milk.|$|R
25|$|Usually, an {{emulsifying}} agent, such as soy lecithin, is added, {{though a}} few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO-free, sometimes {{at the cost of}} a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using PGPR, an artificial <b>emulsifier</b> derived from castor oil that allows them {{to reduce the amount of}} cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel.|$|E
25|$|Mayonnaise {{varies in}} color, but is often white, cream, or pale yellow. It may range in texture {{from that of}} light cream to a thick gel. In {{countries}} influenced by French culture, mustard is also a common ingredient, but the addition of mustard turns the sauce into a remoulade with a different flavor and the mustard acts as an additional <b>emulsifier.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mayonnaise {{can be made}} by {{hand with}} a whisk, or fork, or with the aid of an {{electric}} mixer or blender. It is made by slowly adding oil to an egg yolk, while whisking vigorously to disperse the oil. The oil and the water in the yolk form a base of the emulsion, while lecithin and protein from the yolk is the <b>emulsifier</b> that stabilizes it. A combination of van der Waals interactions and electrostatic repulsion determine the bond strength among oil droplets. The high viscosity of mayonnaise is attributed to the total strength created by these two intermolecular forces. Addition of mustard contributes to the taste and further stabilizes the emulsion, as mustard contains small amounts of lecithin. If vinegar is added directly to the yolk, it can emulsify more oil, thus making more mayonnaise.|$|E

25|$|<b>Emulsifiers</b> and stabilizers: Ingredients {{added to}} prevent the {{separation}} of the oil from the water (and its soluble components) in the infant formula. Some commonly used <b>emulsifiers</b> include monoglycerides, diglycerides, and gums.|$|R
40|$|Infant {{formulae}} (IF), {{which are}} emulsion-based nutritional products, {{are prone to}} destabilisation during processing and on storage due to their inherent thermodynamic instability. Currently, IF emulsions are stabilised mainly by innate protein-based <b>emulsifiers</b> that are adapted (e. g., source, profile, peptide chain length) to cater for specific nutritional requirements, and often require the inclusion of non-protein <b>emulsifiers</b> (e. g., polar lipids) to improve stability of these products. This thesis represents new and innovative research on the properties and performance of selected innate and added <b>emulsifiers</b> in IF products (i. e., whey protein isolate, WPI; whey protein hydrolysate, WPH; phospholipids and citric acid esters of glycerides) and more novel <b>emulsifiers</b> formed by Maillard-induced conjugation of WPH with maltodextrin. This research focused predominantly on the surface activity of <b>emulsifiers,</b> their ability to form emulsions and to subsequently stabilise them against shear-, heat- and storageinduced changes. Conditions {{used to test the}} stabilisation properties included refrigerated storage (14 d at 4 °C), thermal processing (75 - 100 °C × 15 min), accelerated shelf-life testing and spray-drying. Studies on the stability of model IF emulsions showed that prevalence of detrimental changes, such as competitive displacement of <b>emulsifiers</b> from interfaces of oil globules and their coalescence during storage, and protein/peptide-mediated aggregation of oil globules during heating, were significantly influenced by the <b>emulsifiers</b> used to form these emulsions. In a similar way, the <b>emulsifiers</b> influenced spray-drying properties (e. g., cohesive interactions) of model IF systems by contributing to different surface composition of resulting powders. The findings presented in this thesis constitute a significant advancement in research on mechanisms of stabilisation of IF emulsions provided by a potent steric barrier on oil globules using conjugated proteins/peptides; this work adds to the rapidly expanding research on interfacial composition and structural organisation of oil globules in IF products and opens up new possibilities for designing novel emulsion-based nutritional products...|$|R
25|$|Lecithin is a {{naturally}} occurring lipid. It {{can be found}} in egg yolks and oil-producing plants. it is an <b>emulsifier</b> and thus is used in many foods. Corn, soy and safflower oil are sources of lecithin, though the majority of lecithin commercially available is derived from soy. Sufficiently processed lecithin is often undetectable with standard testing practices. According to the FDA, no evidence shows or suggests hazard to the public when lecithin is used at common levels. Lecithin added to foods amounts to only 2 to 10 percent of the 1 to 5 g of phosphoglycerides consumed daily on average. Nonetheless, consumer concerns about GM food extend to such products. This concern led to policy and regulatory changes in Europe in 2000, when Regulation (EC) 50/2000 was passed which required labelling of food containing additives derived from GMOs, including lecithin. Because of the difficulty of detecting the origin of derivatives like lecithin with current testing practices, European regulations require those who wish to sell lecithin in Europe to employ a comprehensive system of Identity preservation (IP).|$|E

2500|$|Biodiesel {{may contain}} small but {{problematic}} quantities of water. Although {{it is only}} slightly miscible with water it is hygroscopic. One of the reasons biodiesel can absorb water is the persistence of mono and diglycerides left over from an incomplete reaction.

2500|$|As a salt, its {{dominant}} use is as an <b>emulsifier</b> for the {{emulsion polymerization}} of fluoropolymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, or Teflon), polyvinylidene fluoride, and fluoroelastomers. For this use, 3M subsidiary Dyneon has a replacement emulsifer despite DuPont stating PFOA is an [...] "essential processing aid". PFOA {{is used in}} the production of Gore-Tex as it is PTFE-based. In PTFE processing, PFOA is in aqueous solution and forms micelles that contain tetrafluoroethylene and the growing polymer. PFOA can be used to stabilize fluoropolymer and fluoroelastomer suspensions before further industrial processing and in ion-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography it can act as an extraction agent. PFOA also finds uses in electronic products and as an industrial fluorosurfactant.|$|E

2500|$|To make 1kg (2.2lb) of chocolate, about 300 to 600 {{beans are}} processed, {{depending}} on the desired cocoa content. In a factory, the beans are roasted. Next, they are cracked and then deshelled by a [...] "winnower". The resulting pieces of beans are called nibs. They are sometimes sold in small packages at specialty stores and markets {{to be used in}} cooking, snacking, and chocolate dishes. Since nibs are directly from the cocoa tree, they contain high amounts of theobromine. Most nibs are ground, using various methods, into a thick, creamy paste, known as chocolate liquor or cocoa paste. [...] This [...] "liquor" [...] is then further processed into chocolate by mixing in (more) cocoa butter and sugar (and sometimes vanilla and lecithin as an <b>emulsifier),</b> and then refined, conched and tempered. [...] Alternatively, it can be separated into cocoa powder and cocoa butter using a hydraulic press or the Broma process. This process produces around 50% cocoa butter and 50% cocoa powder. Standard cocoa powder has a fat content around 10–12%. Cocoa butter is used in chocolate bar manufacture, other confectionery, soaps, and cosmetics.|$|E
50|$|A solid lipid {{nanoparticle}} {{is typically}} spherical with -an average diameter between 10 and 1000 nanometers. Solid lipid nanoparticles possess a solid lipid core matrix that can solubilize lipophilic molecules. The lipid core is stabilized by surfactants (<b>emulsifiers).</b> The term lipid is used {{here in a}} broader sense and includes triglycerides (e.g. tristearin), diglycerides (e.g. glycerol bahenate), monoglycerides (e.g. glycerol monostearate), fatty acids (e.g. stearic acid), steroids (e.g. cholesterol), and waxes (e.g. cetyl palmitate).
