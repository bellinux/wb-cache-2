5000|$|The {{types of}} video {{modulation}} {{can be classified}} by {{the way that a}} <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> is combined with video signal. The video signal and <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> both exist in waveform and when the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> [...] "carries" [...] the video signal, the shape of <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> is changed and the changed <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> is the RF signal. Hence, how the shape of <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> is changed is the key to classify the types of video modulation.|$|R
50|$|Amplitude {{modulation}} {{works by}} varying the amplitude of the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> {{according to the}} bent waveform of original video signal. In other words, when the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> is combined with the video signal, frequency of the combined signal {{is the same as}} the frequency of the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> while the amplitude is varied. The picture above can more directly explain how the shape is changed. In the combining process, if the video signal is at its peak (highest amplitude value), the amplitude of the varied <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> will be the highest and as for trough (lowest amplitude value), the amplitude of varied <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> will be the lowest. In other words, at the point in <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> that corresponds to the peak of video signal, the shape of wave will be most bulged and at the point corresponding to the trough, the shape will be most sunk. In fact, the change in amplitude of <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> is proportional to the amplitude of the video signal.|$|R

In addition, the concept of using the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> three times is proposed {{and put into practice}} to tackle the multi-variables optimization problems, where the searching for the optimal point of the last several variables is frequently worse than the first several ones...|$|R
50|$|In {{frequency}} modulation, the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> {{is combined}} with video signal by varying the instantaneous frequency of the wave (the frequency of wave at a particular point). (Compare with amplitude modulation, in which the amplitude of the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> varies, while the frequency remains constant.) From the picture above, if the video signal is at its peak, the instantaneous frequency of <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> will increase {{and as for the}} trough, the instantaneous frequency will decrease. More visually, the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> becomes densest at the point corresponding to the peak in video signal and thinnest at the point corresponding to the trough.|$|R
2500|$|In {{telecommunications}} and signal processing, frequency modulation (FM) is the {{encoding of information}} in a <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> by varying the instantaneous frequency of the wave.

25|$|The {{first use}} for the diode was the {{demodulation}} of amplitude modulated (AM) radio broadcasts. The history of this discovery is treated in depth in the radio article. In summary, an AM signal consists of alternating positive and negative peaks of a radio <b>carrier</b> <b>wave,</b> whose amplitude or envelope {{is proportional to the}} original audio signal. The diode (originally a crystal diode) rectifies the AM radio frequency signal, leaving only the positive peaks of the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave.</b> The audio is then extracted from the rectified <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> using a simple filter and fed into an audio amplifier or transducer, which generates sound waves.|$|R

The stable region of accelerometer reduces while the amplitude of <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> increases. The rolling test in 1 g gravitational field is carried out to calibrate the accelerometer with different <b>carrier</b> <b>waves.</b> The experiment results indicate that to keep the accelerometer working within the stable region, the amplitude of carrier should be selected from 1 V to 5 V. When the amplitude is less than 5 V, the {{sensitivity of}} the accelerometer will be improved with the increase of amplitude of <b>carrier</b> <b>wave,</b> while the linearity will be decreased. Once the voltage exceeds 5 V, the electrostatic force will equal to the elastic force, and this will lead the system into unstable state...|$|R

30|$|Multi-Frequency VLBI (MFV) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} methods for precise positioning of spacecrafts. The system transmits three <b>carrier</b> <b>waves</b> at S-band and one wave at X-band. These frequencies are set to resolve the cycle ambiguity of <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> at X-band from two group delays between <b>carrier</b> <b>waves</b> and one phase delay of the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> at S-band. The procedure to resolve the cycle ambiguity is proposed in this article. Some conditions about frequency variation and prediction of position and the ionosphere are also clarified for resolving the cycle ambiguity. The dedicated recording system for MFV is developed. A preliminary observation of MFV is carried out with this system by using Lunar Prospector. As a result of the experiment, residual phases from predicted ones are within ± 2 π, and the RMS of the residual for the period of several seconds is about 4 degrees. This result supports realization of the MFV.|$|R
5000|$|Video {{modulation}} is {{a strategy}} of transmitting video signal {{in the field of}} radio modulation and television technology. This strategy enables the video signal to be transmitted more efficiently through long distances. In general, video modulation means that a higher frequency <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> is modified according to the original video signal. In this way, <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> contains the information in the video signal. Then, the carrier will [...] "carry" [...] the information in the form of radio frequency (RF) signal. When carrier reaches its destination, the video signal is extracted from the carrier by decoding. In other words, the video signal is first combined with a higher frequency <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> so that <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> contains the information in video signal. The combined signal is called radio-frequency signal. At the end of this transmitting system, the RF signals stream from a light sensor and hence, the receivers can obtain the initial data in the original video signal.|$|R

40|$|In {{frequency}} modulation (FM) systems, a continuous-time information signal is modulated onto a sinusoidal <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> {{by using the}} information signal to modulate {{the frequency of the}} <b>carrier</b> <b>wave.</b> In this thesis, a more general type of modulation is developed, of which FM is a special case, that we refer to as rate modulation. A rate modulation system consists of a dynamical system whose rate of evolution is varied in proportion to an information signal. The rate-modulated <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> is a scalar function of the state variables of the modulator. The thesis is focused on three aspects of rate modulation and demodulation systems. First, explicit expressions are derived for the power density spectrum of the rate modulated <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> for sinusoidal modulation. Second, a systematic procedure is derived for constructing demodulators. This procedure requires that the dynamical system used in the modulator has a known exponentially convergent observer. Assuming such an observer is known, a systematic procedure for constructing demodulators is given that depends on the underlying dynamical system in a simple manner. Finally, the quasi-moment neglect closure technique is used to approximate the signal-to-noise ratio when the <b>carrier</b> <b>wave</b> is corrupted by additive white-noise. by Wade P. Torres.
