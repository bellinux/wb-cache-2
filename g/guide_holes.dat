When the tip of the tumbler is nearly centered, it slips into the receiving hole in the hammer mass, and releases the hammer. The hammer mass is then allowed to move forward, propelled by the rear spring. Because the hole in the hammer mass does not go through the mass and is less deep than the end section of the tumbler, the tip of the tumbler bottoms out in the hole in the hammer, and the impulse of the hammer mass is transmitted through the tumbler, through the punch, and to the workpiece.|$|R

The grid was fabricated using conventional machining techniques and three-dimensional printing. Results: A pilot study involving microinjection of the magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent gadolinium into the discrete regions of interest (ROIs) in the temporal cortex of an awake, behaving monkey demonstrated the effectiveness of this new design of the guide grid.

The quality of false-twist textured yarn from disk friction spindles is very strongly influenced by unit operating conditions and untwisting tension. The authors previously proposed a method to derive tension and untwisting tension in the yarn given the twisting tension and yarn path in double-stack disk friction units. In this study our goal was to calculate both yarn path and yarn tension. We were able to compare and confirm that the calculated yarn path and yarn tension closely matches experimental results. In addition, we succeeded in using our model to predict conditions for <b>guide</b> <b>hole</b> to produce false-twist yarn. The validity of our model was proven by the results.

30|$|Considering the demerits of the {{interference}} mechanism {{regarding the use}} of articulated forceps in laparoscopic surgery, a new wrist mechanism had been proposed. The kinematic model of this mechanism is decoupled between the pitch axis and yaw axis by a very simple mechanism that employs arc-shaped guides and wire <b>guide</b> <b>holes.</b> The arc-shaped guides minimize the wire path length error of yaw and gripper axis wire due to the motion of the pitch axis. The optimized position of the arc-shaped guides is decided by the minimal RMS of the wire path length error. The proposed wrist mechanism has only half the number of parts as compared to the previously developed clinical use robotic forceps [5, 7]. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism was demonstrated by using a prototype model with a maximum outer diameter of 7.5  mm. Conversely, the disadvantages of the proposed mechanism lie in the transmission mechanism efficiency and no-load input torque.|$|E
30|$|Laparoscopic surgery, {{which is}} also called {{minimally}} invasive surgery, is a surgical technique {{that is associated with}} accelerated post-operative recovery. However, it can only be performed by surgeons possessing advanced surgical skills. One of the main challenges in laparoscopic surgery is the restriction of the free motion of forceps because of the limited degrees of freedom imposed by the trocar. Recently, to overcome this problem, many master–slave manipulators with articulated forceps have been used in laparoscopic surgery. The wrist mechanism of the articulated forceps affects the controllability and range of motion of the slave manipulator in the abdominal cavity of a patient. Therefore, improvement of the wrist mechanism of the articulated forceps is important for robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery. This study proposes a new wrist mechanism for using articulated forceps in laparoscopic surgery. The degrees of freedom of the proposed design are provided by motor-driven or manually driven axes employing various wires and pulleys (pitch, yaw, and gripper axes). The kinematic model of this mechanism is decoupled between the pitch axis and yaw axis by a very simple mechanism using arc-shaped guides and wire <b>guide</b> <b>holes.</b> The arc-shaped guides minimize the wire path length error of the yaw and gripper axis wire resulting from the motion of the pitch axis. The optimized position of the arc-shaped guides is decided by the minimal root-mean-square value of the wire path length error. The proposed wrist mechanism has only half the number of parts as compared to the previously developed robotic forceps for clinical use. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism was demonstrated on a prototype model with a maximum outer diameter of 7.5  mm. Conversely, the disadvantages of the proposed mechanism lie in the transmission mechanism efficiency and no-load input torque.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried in {{conjunction}} with the Orthodontic department at Halmstad General Hospital in Sweden to investigate the possibility of reducing cost and manufacture time of dental implant drill guides. The current system involves sending a digital image in STL format to the Materialise factory in Belgium where information of the position of dental implants is translated onto a moulded mouthpiece. Drill guides are placed in the mouth piece which is then returned to the surgeon. The mouthpiece complete with drill guides is then placed in the patients mouth and used as a guide for the implant drill holes. The cost of 10000 sek and a turnaround time of 2 weeks gave rise to the need for a faster and cheaper solution. A new mouthpiece was designed comprising of a solid cube which could be clearly seen on the x-ray. Linearisation of the cube faces is used to find a reference point from which to drive a 5 axis drilling platform. The mouthpiece is placed in the drill platform which is driven by stepper motors which in turn are controlled by a microcontroller. Co-ordinates are entered via a PC interface. The PC software then translates these co-ordinates into motor steps which are sent to the microcontroller. The drill platform then positions the mouthpiece in order to drill <b>guide</b> <b>holes</b> for the dental implants. The study showed that the machine design gave an acceptable degree of accuracy and repeatability. Further enhancements could be made by automating the detection of the cube using image analysis techniques. The study was also limited by the lack of graphical and geometrical data concerning the position of the implant. For {{the purpose of this study}} the co-ordinates for the implants guides is entered by hand. It was concluded that further software and hardware enhancement would be needed before the application could be developed commercially...|$|E
40|$|The Basic Valve Theory {{is based}} on steady ow characteristics. Therefore {{unsteady}} ow conditions in the model valve have been considered {{in order to assess}} effects of unsteadiness on the performance of the Basic Valve Theory. The instantaneous gas force was predicted rather accurately by the theory. However, it has also been observed that ow hystersis effects are present. These effects are postulated to be caused by a periodically detaching and reattaching ow at the seat. This hypothesis has been enforced by predicting the valve state variables, employing the Extended Valve Theory. The Extended Valve Theory takes into account the ow inertia in the port and the plate speed. However, further exploration of the validity of the Extended Valve Theory for a broader range of parameters has to be performed. For a commercial compressor valve also unsteady ow experiments have been conducted. For the limiter almost inelastic plate collisions have been observed. The collisions of the plate with the seat resulted in severe rocking effects. These effects are postulated to be caused by the absence of gas damping, the relatively low spring force and the position of the <b>guiding</b> <b>holes</b> in the plate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. One new sliding-block {{balancing}} mechanism is {{proposed for the}} single-cylinder diesel engine. In the new mechanism, the sliding block is installed against the engine piston. The reciprocation trajectory of sliding block is collinear with the piston trajectory, while sliding block and piston move in the opposite direction, just like two opposite crank connecting rods. The new mechanism includes the crankshaft, connecting rod ring, the slider and the guide components. Through the bearing, connecting rod is installed in the eccentric journal of the crankshaft. The circular connecting rod is in the accurate guiding surface of the slider; and the guide pins are in the guide groove. Guide rod connects with supporting shaft through the <b>guide</b> <b>hole</b> of the slide. The optimized parameters for the sliding block show that the ratio of eccentric distance of the eccentric journal {{to the length of}} the connecting rod is equal to the ratio of crank radius to connecting rod length. The appropriate results can balance both the centrifugal inertia force and the reciprocating inertia force generated by piston group. Even the complete balance of the first and second-order reciprocating inertia forces can be obtained, which can reduce the vibration and noise of diesel engine...|$|R

40|$|Core {{decompression}} is {{an efficient}} treatment for early stage ischemic necrosis of the femoral head. In conventional procedures, the pre-operative X-ray only shows one {{plane of the}} ischemic area, which often results in inaccurate drilling. This paper introduces a new method that uses computer-assisted technology and rapid prototyping to enhance drilling accuracy during core decompression surgeries and presents a validation study of cadaveric tests. Twelve cadaveric human femurs were used to simulate early-stage ischemic necrosis. The core decompression target at the anterolateral femoral head was simulated using an embedded glass ball (target). Three positioning Kirschner wires were drilled into {{the top and bottom}} of the large rotor. The specimen was then subjected to computed tomography (CT). A CT image of the specimen was imported into the Mimics software to construct a three-dimensional model including the target. The best core decompression channel was then designed using the 3 D model. A navigational template for the specimen was designed using the Pro/E software and manufactured by rapid prototyping technology to guide the drilling channel. The specimen-specific navigation template was installed on the specimen using positioning Kirschner wires. Drilling was performed using a guide needle through the <b>guiding</b> <b>hole</b> on the templates. The distance between the end point of the guide needle and the target was measured to validate the patient-specific surgical accuracy. The average distance between the tip of the guide needle drilled through the guiding template and the target was 1. 92 ± 0. 071 mm. Core decompression using a computer-rapid prototyping template is a reliable and accurate technique that could provide a new method of precision decompression for early-stage ischemic necrosis...|$|R

Preoperative magnetic resonance angiography showed occlusion of the left vertebral artery. A laminar screw was inserted into the patent side (i. e., the right side of C 2). Cervical pedicle screws are the most biomechanically stable screws. However, their use carries a high risk of neurovascular complications during screw insertion, because the cervical pedicle is small and is adjacent laterally to the vertebral artery, medially to the spinal cord, and vertically to the nerve roots. Lateral mass screws are also reported to involve a risk of neurovascular injuries.
