Due to the physical meaning of radiometric measurements, performing better for high precipitation regimes, we use SSM/I retrieval to calibrate the high precipitation NAW area.

Iodine- 129 (129 I), a long-lived radioisotope generated by nuclear weapons and fuel reprocessing, offers a potential alternative. This study compared the isotopic ratio of 129 I to stable 127 I with ages previously calculated with tritium. A strong logarithmic correlation was found between the tritium ages and the isotopic ratio. Values from Sabino Canyon and Marshall Gulch precipitation and surface water were compared to global values from published research and in both cases isotopic ratios in precipitation were higher than for surface water, which were higher than ocean or groundwater. The Arizona samples show a seasonal variation in isotopic ratio between summer monsoon and winter <b>frontal</b> <b>precipitation,</b> with values significantly higher in the summer. Mixing model analysis performed on Marshall Gulch surface water and using deep groundwater, precipitation, and soil water as end members, showed a shift in sulfate concentration between these seasons that mimics the variation in isotopic ratio.

40|$|The synoptic-scale {{climatology}} of cold <b>frontal</b> <b>precipitation</b> systems {{during the}} passage over central Japan was investigated for 19 years (1988 - 2006). Cold <b>frontal</b> <b>precipitation</b> events are classified {{into the following}} three types: Widespread, Hokuriku, and Jump type. Widespread-type events, which bring precipitation throughout Japan, mainly occur in spring and autumn, and the cyclones tend to move northeastward from {{the central part of}} the Sea of Japan. The central pressure of the Widespread-type cyclones is the deepest and this type has the most moisture out of the three types. Hokuriku-type events, which bring precipitation exclusively over the Hokuriku area often appear in winter, and the cyclones move eastward from the northern part of the Sea of Japan. As a result, the isobars form in an east-west orientation over mainland Japan as the cold front arrives in the Hokuriku area. The Hokuriku-type cyclones tend to be relatively weak and there is less moisture during the events. For the Jump-type events, in which the precipitation distribution appears as precipitation bands jumping over the Kanto area, cyclones develop rapidly due to the deep trough at the 500 hPa level, changing the isobars from east-to-west to northeast-to-southwest during the events...|$|E

The precipitation occurring ahead of the surface warm front was banded. The dominant precipitation bands were oriented transverse to the mid-level winds, and they were spaced 110 km apart. It is suggested that these bands were formed by highly organized vertical circulations in a 2. 5 km thick layer just above the warm <b>frontal</b> zone. The <b>precipitation</b> bands extended from this layer down to the surface. Near the surface additional circulations were produced by pressure perturbations resulting from cooling associated with melting snow. Some diagnostic calculations of ageostrophic winds, frontogenesis and vorticity production are presented.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the sensitivity of}} simulated cloud properties and surface precipitation to assumptions regarding the size distributions of the precipitating hydrometeors in a one-moment bulk microphysics scheme. Three sensitivity experiments were applied to two composites of 15 convective and 15 <b>frontal</b> stratiform intense <b>precipitation</b> events observed in a coastal midlatitude region (Belgium), which were evaluated against satellite-retrieved cloud properties and radar-rain-gauge derived surface precipitation. It is found that the cloud optical thickness distribution was well captured by all experiments, although a significant underestimation of cloudiness occurred in the convective composite. The cloud-top-pressure distribution was improved most by more realistic snow size distributions (including a temperature-dependent intercept parameter and non-spherical snow for the calculation of the slope parameter), due to increased snow depositional growth at high altitudes. Surface precipitation was far less sensitive to whether graupel or hail {{was chosen as the}} rimed ice species, as compared to previous idealized experiments. This smaller difference in sensitivity could be explained by the stronger updraught velocities and higher freezing levels in the idealized experiments compared to typical coastal midlatitude environmental conditions. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Regional climate {{experiments}} {{focusing on}} the Baiu <b>frontal</b> <b>precipitation</b> were performed on the Earth Simulator using a non-hydrostatic cloud-system-resolving atmospheric model (NHM) with a horizontal resolution of 5 km (5 km-NHM) and 1 km (1 km-NHM). The outputs of an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) with a horizontal resolution of about 20 km were used as the boundary of 5 km-NHM. The time-slice method in both {{the present and future}} climates was applied for the experiments of the AGCM and NHM. In the present climate experiments, it was evaluated that the precipitation distribution and precipitation frequency spectrum (PFS; frequency with intensities) of the 5 km-NHM were well reproduced in comparison with those observed. Here, the AGCM in the present climate well reproduced the large-scale characteristics of the Baiu <b>frontal</b> <b>precipitation.</b> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A 1 B CO 2 emission scenario was used to project changes in the precipitation property around the Baiu front due to global warm-ing in the future climate around the end of the 21 st Century.

40|$|The solar {{resource}} in South Africa {{is among the}} best in the world. South Africa has seen an increase in local and international investment in solar power. The optimum angles at which a solar collector should be fixed are often debated. Similar publications on this topic often rely on mathematical models of solar resource rather than measured data. Measured data is preferred since the effects of pollution and weather are included. In this work, recently measured data from nine measuring stations in the Southern African Universities Radiometric Network (SAURAN) equipped with pyranometers and pyrheliometers are considered. The data is used to calculate the annual solar insolation on fixed collectors at all possible installation angles. SolTrace, a ray-tracing software, is used for validation. Relative to horizontally-fixed collectors, the annual solar insolation is 10 % more for optimally-fixed collectors and 45 % more for solartracking collectors. The effects of tilt and azimuth angles are presented on contour plots, which are convenient for cost analysis and the determination of the annual insolation on building surfaces. The optimum azimuth angle is a function of the longitude angle minus the absolute latitude angle, which suggests that <b>frontal</b> and convective <b>precipitation</b> effects influence the optimum azimuth angle.

40|$|How global {{precipitation}} {{will change}} {{in the future is}} of great socio-economic im-portance. It is therefore vital that climate models are able to adequately simulate the characteristics of precipitation and the individual precipitation events. Fronts {{play an important role in}} providing precipitation and they can be associated with heavy rain and flooding. In this paper the ACCESS 1. 3 atmosphere model is evaluated in terms of <b>frontal</b> and non-frontal <b>precipitation.</b> An objective front identification method is applied to data from reanalysis and the model. The fronts are then linked to daily precipi-tation from observational estimates and the model. The proportion of precipita-tion associated with fronts and the average intensity of precipitation associated with fronts are then calculated and compared. The frequency of fronts and the proportion of precipitation associated with fronts are well captured by the model. The intensity of precipitation when a front is present is underestimated by the model in most regions, consistent with many previous studies. Decomposing the total precipitation error into components as-sociated with the frequency and intensity of both frontal and non-frontal precipi-tation shows that the non-frontal precipitation errors contribute the most to the total error, and that there are compensating errors in the model. This regime- and process-based method of model evaluation provides a useful tool to gain deeper understanding into the sources of precipitation errors in climate models...|$|R

Information of this type is rarely available except on a state-wide or regional basis. Most natural areas, parks, and wildlife refuges maintain avian species lists that designate seasonal and numerical status, but {{these do not include}} actual dates of arrival and departure, and are seldom based on records spanning more than a few years.

40|$|On 2 March 2004 {{a marked}} upper-level trough and an {{associated}} surface cold front penetrated into the Sahara. High winds along and behind this frontal system {{led to an}} extraordinary, large-scale, and long-lived dust out reak, accompanied by significant precipitation over parts of Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. This paper uses sensitivity simulations with the limited-area model developed by the Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling (COSMO) together with analysis data and surface observations to test several hypotheses on the dynamics of this case proposedin previous work. It is demonstrated that air over central Algeria is cooled by evaporation of <b>frontal</b> <b>precipitation,</b> substantially enhancing winds {{at the leading edge}} of the cold front. This process is supported by very drylow-level air in the lee of the Atlas Mountains associated with a foehn situation. Flattening the mountain chain in a sensitivity experiment, however, has complex effects on the wind. While reduced evaporative cooling weakens the front, the elimination of the orographic blocking accelerates its penetration into the Sahara. The simulations also indicate high winds associated with a hydraulic jump at the southern slopes of the Tell Atlas. Feedingthe simulated winds into a dust emission parameterization reveals reduced emissions on the order of 20 %- 30 % for suppressed latent heating and even more when effects of the increased precipitation on soil moisture are considered. In the experiment with the Atlas removed, effects of the overall increase in high winds are compensated by an increase in precipitation. The results suggest that a realistic representation of <b>frontal</b> <b>precipitation</b> is an important requisite to accurately model dust emission in such situations...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} an empirical method for optimizing polarimetric variables {{in order to}} improve the accuracy of dual-polarization radar rainfall estimation using data derived from radars operated by different agencies. The empirical method was developed using the Yong-In Testbed (YIT) radar operated by the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). The method is based on the determination of relations between polarimetric variables. Relations for Z – Z DR and Z – K DP are derived from the measurements of a two-dimensional video disdrometer installed about 30  km away from the YIT radar. These relations were used to adjust the polarimetric variables of the dual-polarization constant altitude plan position indicator (CAPPI) at a height of 1. 5  km. The CAPPI data with the adjusted polarimetric variables were used to estimate rainfalls using three different radar rainfall estimation algorithms. The first algorithm is based on Z, the second on Z and Z DR, and the third on Z, Z DR, and K DP. The accuracy of the radar-estimated rainfall was then assessed using raingauge observations. Three rainfall events with more than 40  mm of maximum hourly rainfall were shown to have the best estimation when the method using Z, Z DR, and K DP was used. However, stratiform precipitation events were better estimated by the algorithm using Z and Z DR. The method was also applied to the data of three radars that belong to KMA and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport. The evaluation was done for six months (May–October) in 2015.

5|$|The Antarctic Oscillation, {{also known}} as the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode is the main factor in tropospheric {{circulation}} variability south of 20oS and is characterized by pressure anomalies with one situated in the Antarctic and one situated in a band at around 40–50oS around the globe. It mainly affects middle and high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by the north–south displacement of the westerly wind belt that circle around Antarctica. Such variation in the position of the westerly wind belt affects the intensity and position of cold fronts and mid latitude storm systems and is partly responsible for variation in precipitation in the southern parts of Argentina. The Antarctic Oscillation is characterized by two phases: a positive and a negative phase. A positive phase is when the westerly wind belt is displaced to the south. The positive phase occurs when there is increased surface pressure over the southern parts of the South American continent and decreased pressure in Antarctica. This results in stronger westerly winds in the southern parts of the country while preventing cold fronts from penetrating inland, producing more stable conditions. Furthermore, the positive phase leads to warmer conditions south of 40oS, particularly during the summer in areas between 40–60oS. Precipitation is lower due to less <b>frontal</b> and orographic <b>precipitation</b> resulting from reduced westerly wind flow between 40–60OS. Opposite conditions occur in the negative phase when the westerly wind belt is shifted equatorward. Cold fronts moving northwards from the south penetrate more frequently, leading to more precipitation and cooler temperatures during the negative phase. The major effect of negative phase of the Antarctic Oscillation occurs in spring when it increases precipitation over southeastern South America.|$|R
40|$|The {{variation}} of precipitation in South America {{is characterized by}} different mechanisms that both initiate and sustain precipitation. Analysis to characterize regional differences is done utilizing datasets derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite as well as National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Reanalysis data. Four regions were studied. These included the Amazon Basin (West), northeast coast (East), location of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ), and extreme southeastern Brazil (South). In these regions, variables such as rain rate, feature size, lighting flash counts, updraft strength, and thermodynamic fluxes were analyzed.   Before onset in the Amazon Basin, sensible heat flux increases and is well correlated with increases in lighting flash counts that were observed using TRMM, implying thermodynamic forcing. After onset, the features become less electrified, however their frequency and rain rates increase. The East region experiences similar pre and post-onset behavior, however oceanic influence not only limits the vertical intensity of convection, but also acts to delay the timing of onset by two months, compared to the West.   Fronts are the dominant driver of precipitation in the SACZ region, increasing in frequency as onset approaches. Time series analysis from TRMM illustrates high variability in precipitation and increases in frequency of features here {{that is consistent with}} an increase in frontal activity. Also, composite directional wind plots using NCEP 850 mb wind data, reveals interactions between the Tropics and sub-Tropics. Pre-onset MCCs dominate South time series and <b>frontal</b> intrusions drive <b>precipitation</b> in the post-onset period.   Understanding distinct regional mechanisms of precipitation can increase the predictability of monsoon onset all over South America. This is important for those who live there and depend on seasonal rains for their livelihood. Also, knowing what mechanisms are working in different regions at different times of the year and incorporating their respective contributions to the global heat budget, we can increase the accuracy of global models.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} a climatological investigation of different orographic precipitation enhancement processes in the Alps. On the one hand, the database consists of observations of more than 1000 weather stations in Bavaria and western Austria for the time period of 1991 - 2000. On the other hand, a MM 5 -climate-mode-simulation driven with ERA- 40 reanalysis data provides information about the environmental meteorological conditions. After a short introduction into the basics of orographic precipitation enhancement and into some simple linear models, the different station data are converted into a uniform temporal resolution of 6 hours. To estimate the relative contribution of different precipitation types, we distinguish between cold fronts, warm fronts, convection and a class carrying unclassified events. Convective precipitation in connection with fronts is attributed to the respective frontal class. Unclassified events predominantly consist of postfrontal upslope precipitation and quasi-stationary fronts. In addition, the wind direction at Alpine crest level (700 hPa) is considered. In a first step, the precipitation differences between the Alpine foreland and the northern Alps are analyzed. The investigation of the climatological importance of the 4 precipitation types in various regions shows that summertime convection and orographic lifting make the largest contribution to the precipitation gradient towards the Alps. Convective precipitation occurs predominantly in association with southwesterly flow and is more abundant in the Alps than in the adjacent forelands because convection is primarily triggered over the Alps. Orographic lifting is most active in case of northwesterly and northerly winds and intensifies both <b>frontal</b> and postfrontal <b>precipitation.</b> The climatological importance of orographic lifting is much larger in winter than in summer. A reversed precipitation gradient with systematically more precipitation in the foreland than in the Alps is found for fronts associated with a wind direction of exactly 270 ^∘. Under these circumstances, the wind blows parallel to the mountain range and lee effects related to upstream topography reduce the precipitation intensity in the Alps. The climatological precipitation maximum is shifted from westerly towards northerly winds when moving from west to east in the northern Alps. The second part of this work comprises {{an investigation of the}} climatological precipitation decrease from the northern Alps to the inner-Alpine valleys. The comparison between the precipitation distribution of 3 regions in the northern Alps and 3 regions in the central Alps shows that especially for cold fronts and unclassified events in connection with northwesterly or northerly flow, a distinctive precipitation surplus {{can be found in the}} northern Alps. For convective precipitation and southwesterly or westerly winds the inner-Alpine regions show high convective activity. For southerly wind directions the showers formed over the central Alps are advected towards the northern Alps, where they sometimes even intensify due to a convergence with the inflow from the Alpine foreland. There is a strong west-east precipitation gradient in the central Alps. The decreasing crest level of the northern Alps and the decreasing north-south-extension of the Alps together with the topographical structure of the valleys are the main reasons for the higher precipitation amounts in the eastern parts of the central Alps than in the western parts. Additionally, an investigation of the precipitation gradient in dependence on the temperature level is made. However, a classification of the precipitation events into 3 classes (snow line > 2500 m, 2500 m - 1000 m, < 1000 m) does not show any clear results. The next part investigates altitudinal precipitation differences in the Alps. The analysis is performed for four station pairs, consisting of a mountain station and a nearby valley station each. The climatological precipitation distribution shows that the mountain stations usually receive substantially more precipitation than the valley stations, especially for northwesterly and northerly ambient flow in 700 hPa. However, the differences are regionally variable and indicate a strong influence of the local topography. Moreover, precipitation enhancement over mountains tends to be substantially more effective for low temperatures than for high temperatures. A more detailed investigation of some parameters affecting orographic precipitation enhancement is conducted for stratiform precipitation events. The magnitude of orographic precipitation enhancement markedly increases with the wind speed at 700 hPa. Moreover, precipitation enhancement increases with the depth of the moist layer in the approaching flow. High resolution simulations with the MM 5 model are conducted for four climatologically representative precipitation events in the Zugspitze area. The first two wintertime cases are characterized by a strong northwesterly or northerly flow, associated with large precipitation differences between the mountain and the valley stations. For these cases the model validation shows good agreement with the observed precipitation patterns. The model results indicate a dominance of the classical seeder-feeder mechanism, with strong orographic lifting generating dense orographic clouds over the mountain ridges. The third precipitation event is also associated with a northerly flow, but in this case the low wind speeds do not cause enough orographical lifting so that the mountain-valley precipitation differences are rather small. The last case represents summertime precipitation events with northerly flow, a high snow line and almost no precipitation difference between the Zugspitze and the surrounding valley stations. The correlation between the model and the observations is not as good, because embedded convective cells are not reproduced in a deterministic sense in the MM 5. The dynamical and microphysical fields show that the snow line around the peak causes a local precipitation minimum at the Zugspitze. Because of different fall speeds of snow/graupel and rain there is a divergence of the hydrometeorological trajectories near the peak and therefore the precipitation maximum is shifted towards the lee...|$|R

30|$|From {{previous}} works on isotope hydrology, {{it has been}} concluded that {{various factors such as}} geographic location, latitude, temperature, etc. affect heavy isotopes concentration of water vapor. It is a finding that, the δ 18 O content in atmospheric water vapor decreases toward continental and higher areas. Since temperature is one of the basic factors controlling evaporization, the concentration of heavy isotopes increases at higher temperature periods. Similarly, precipitations in the summer season have heavier isotopic composition than those of the winter season. Heavy isotope concentration of heavy rains is lower than those of showers. Heavy isotope content decreases gradually toward terrestrial areas in comparison with oceans and seas. Besides these parameters, heavy isotope concentration of the waters falls principally as the elevation increases; in other words, heavy isotopes concentration in the waters is in relation to altitude with an inversely proportional manner.

A procedure was developed to disaggregate daily precipitation data into three main components: <b>frontal</b> <b>precipitation,</b> sum-mer storms, and Mediterranean cyclogenesis. Working hypotheses were derived on the likely processes involved. The results indicate that the precipitation regime in this Mediterranean region is very sensitive to variations in surface airmass temperature and moisture. Land-use perturbations that accumulated over historical time and greatly accelerated in the last 30 yr may have induced changes from an open, monsoon-type regime with frequent summer storms over the mountains inland to one dominated by closed vertical recirculations where feedback mechanisms favor the loss of storms over the coastal mountains and addi-tional heating of the sea surface temperature during summer. This, in turn, favors Mediterranean cyclo-genesis and torrential rains in autumn–winter. Because these intense rains and floods can occur anywhere in the basin, perturbations to the hydrological cycle in any part of the basin can propagate to the whole basin and adjacent regions. Furthermore, present levels of air pollutants can produce greenhouse heating, am...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough many {{theoretical}} and observational studies {{have investigated the}} mechanism of conditional symmetric instability (CSI) release and associated it with mesoscale atmospheric phenomena such as <b>frontal</b> <b>precipitation</b> bands, cloud heads in rapidly developing extratropical cyclones and sting jets, its climatology and contribution to precipitation have not been extensively documented. The aim {{of this paper is}} to quantify the contribution of CSI release, yielding slantwise convection, to climatological precipitation accumulations for the North Atlantic and western Europe. Case studies reveal that CSI release could be common along cold fronts of mature extratropical cyclones and the North Atlantic storm track is found to be a region with large CSI according to two independent CSI metrics. Correlations of CSI with accumulated precipitation are also large in this region and CSI release is inferred to be occurring about 20 % of the total time over depths of over 1 km. We conclude that the inability of current global weather forecast and climate prediction models to represent CSI release (due to insufficient resolution yet lack of subgrid parametrization schemes) may lead to errors in precipitation distributions, particularly in the region of the North Atlantic storm track...|$|E
40|$|In this work, disdrometric {{measurements}} of drop size distribution effected during three <b>frontal</b> <b>precipitation</b> events at Botucatu, SP, during the spring, {{were used to}} establish functional relationships among parameters associated to drop sizes, such as kinetic energy (Ek) and radar reflectivity (Z). Z was also estimated for precipitation using an weather radar located in Bauru, SP. Correlation between Ek and disdrometric determined Z, for the different events, presented good adjustement featuring a R 2 = 0, 9844, resulted in the expression Z = 17. 8 Ek 1, 08, which {{was applied to the}} reflectivity values from the radar, obtained from 3. 5 km CAPPI. From this, the pattern of kinetic energy flux associated with the precipitation field in São Paulo, at a 1 km 2 resolution, can be made available every 7. 5 minutes, in the radar quantification range of 240 km. The knowledge of the soil types from areas of interest, associated to the kinetic energy field of the precipitation over those areas, allows the determination of the respective potential of erosion and, thus, take preventive measures to mitigate the effects should an erosion occur.

40|$|A {{case study}} on {{persistent}} appearance of the ensemble of precipitation bands in the warm sector of the Baiu front in Kyushu District, {{the western part of}} Japan around 19 June 2001 was performed based on the operational observational data. Around 00 UTC (09 JST) 19 June when the Baiu front on the surface weather map was still located about a few 100 kms to the north of Kyushu, the number and the total area of the meso-β or γ-scale line-shaped precipitation bands increased around Kyushu rapidly. These precipitation bands had been sustained there and gradually gathered each other to change into the Baiu <b>frontal</b> <b>precipitation</b> zone extending from the northern Kyushu to Seto-Naikai (Seto Inland Sea) around 09 UTC (18 JST) 19 June (the intense rainfall zone was still located in the warm sector of the Baiu front). Until ~ 09 UTC (18 JST) 19 June, the moist air flow with the latently unstable stratification had been sustained around Kyushu corresponding to the low-level southerly wind toward the surface Baiu front to the north of Kyushu. This large-scale situation would contribute greatly to the maintenance of the ensemble of the line-shaped precipitation bands in the warm sector of the Baiu front...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of cloud and precipitation properties across oceanic extratropical cyclone cold fronts is examined using {{four years of}} combined CloudSat radar and CALIPSO lidar retrievals. The global annual mean cloud and precipitation distributions show that low-level clouds are ubiquitous in the post frontal zone while higher-level cloud frequency and precipitation peak in the warm sector along the surface front. Increases in temperature and moisture within the cold front region are associated with larger high-level but lower mid-/low level cloud frequencies and precipitation decreases in the cold sector. This behavior seems {{to be related to}} a shift from stratiform to convective clouds and precipitation. Stronger ascent in the warm conveyor belt tends to enhance cloudiness and precipitation across the cold front. A strong temperature contrast between the warm and cold sectors also encourages greater post-cold-frontal cloud occurrence. While the seasonal contrasts in environmental temperature, moisture, and ascent strength are enough to explain most of the variations in cloud and precipitation across cold fronts in both hemispheres, they do not fully explain the differences between Northern and Southern Hemisphere cold fronts. These differences are better explained when the impact of the contrast in temperature across the cold front is also considered. In addition, these large-scale parameters do not explain the relatively large frequency in springtime post <b>frontal</b> <b>precipitation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To {{elucidate}} the mechanism {{associated with the}} development of heavy precipitation system, a field experiment was carried out in Jejudo (or Jeju Island) and Marado, Korea from 22 June to 12 July 2006. The synoptic atmospheric conditions were analyzed using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research’s (NCEP/NCAR) reanalyzed data, weather maps, and sounding data. The kinematic characteristics of each precipitation system were investigated by dual Doppler radar analysis. During the field experiment, data of four precipitation events with more than 20 mm rainfall were collected. In F case (<b>frontal</b> <b>precipitation),</b> a typical Changma front was dominant and the observation field was fully saturated. However there was no convective instability near the surface. LF case (low pressure accompanied with Changma front) showed strong convective instability near the surface, while a strong convergence corresponded to the low pressure from China accompanied with Changma front. In FT case (Changma front indirectly influenced by typhoon), the presence of a convective instability indicated the transport of near surface, strong additional moisture from the typhoon ‘EWINIAR’. The convergence wind field was ground to be located at a low level. The convective instability was not significant in T case (precipitation of the typhoon ‘EWINIAR’), since the typhoon passed through Jejudo and the Changma front was disappeared toward the northeastern region of the Korean peninsula. The kinematic (convergence and divergence) characteristics of wind fields, convective instability, and additiona...|$|E
