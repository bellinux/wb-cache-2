5|$|Biblical Hebrew from {{after the}} Babylonian exile in 587BCE {{is known as}} 'Late Biblical Hebrew'. Late Biblical Hebrew shows Aramaic {{influence}} in phonology, morphology, and lexicon, and this trend <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in the later-developed Tiberian vocalization system.|$|E
5|$|The acropolis {{buildings}} contain inscribed graffiti {{dating to}} the last phase of occupation in the Early Postclassic, including human and animal figures, deities, temples and courtly scenes. Colonial graffiti <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> from the visit to the ruins by captain Pedro Montañés {{in the middle of}} the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The astronomical {{ceiling of}} the tomb of Senenmut (BC) {{contains}} the Celestial Diagram depicting circumpolar constellations {{in the form of}} discs. Each disc is divided into 24 sections suggesting a 24-hour time period. Constellations are portrayed as sacred deities of Egypt. The observation of lunar cycles <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident.</b>|$|E
50|$|Several {{problems}} with the Prograph system <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in this method implementation.|$|R
50|$|Generational {{differences}} <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> regarding {{religious practice}} and affiliation within this population group.|$|R
2500|$|Grimwood's {{environmental}} concerns <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> {{in a letter}} he wrote to Los Angeles Times in 2002: ...|$|R
5|$|While {{conventional}} English sonnet form {{described by}} Gascoigne {{is seen in}} Sonnet 86, the Petrarchan sonnet form, which requires a pause between the first eight lines and the last six lines <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident.</b> At the end of line eight Shakespeare uses a period to bring the sonnet to a stop, changing the sonnet's direction by moving away from rhetorical questions to a more decisive tone within the sestet, which seems to answer the distress of the octave.|$|E
5|$|Dejan {{was one of}} the {{prominent}} figures of Dušan's reign and during the subsequent fall of the Serbian Empire, after Dušan's death. Under Emperor Dušan, despot Jovan Oliver, with his brother Bogdan and sevastokrator Dejan, ruled over all of eastern Macedonia. Dejan is not mentioned much in Dušan's military endeavors, although his reputation and that of his successors suggest that he was involved in most of Dušan's successes. His prominence beyond Serbia <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> from the fact that Pope Innocent VI addressed Dejan in 1355, asking him to support the creation of the union between the Catholic Church and the Serbian Orthodox Church (such letters were sent to the highest nobility and the church).|$|E
5|$|Relics of Qutb Shahi and Nizam rule remain visible today; the Charminar—commissioned by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah—has come to symbolise Hyderabad. Golconda fort {{is another}} major landmark. The {{influence}} of Mughlai culture <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in the region's distinctive cuisine, which includes Hyderabadi biryani and Hyderabadi haleem. The Qutb Shahis and Nizams established Hyderabad {{as a cultural}} hub, attracting men of letters {{from different parts of}} the world. Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with the decline of the Mughal Empire in the mid-19th century, with artists migrating to the city {{from the rest of the}} Indian subcontinent. The Telugu film industry based in the city is the country's second-largest producer of motion pictures.|$|E
50|$|Remnants <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in the Kalpavriksha ("wish-fulfilling tree") and the Ashvattha tree of the South Asian religions.|$|R
5000|$|... "Asian values" [...] <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in the {{planning}} of the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997.|$|R
50|$|Farmer's goalscoring prowess <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> when {{representing}} South Australia in interstate matches, {{where he}} averaged five goals per game.|$|R
5|$|The Southeast Asian {{cultural}} influence <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in Malagasy cuisine, {{in which}} rice is consumed at every meal, typically accompanied {{by one of}} a variety of flavorful vegetable or meat dishes. African influence is reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their owner's wealth, traditions originating on the African mainland. Cattle rustling, originally a rite of passage for young men in the plains areas of Madagascar where the largest herds of cattle are kept, has become a dangerous and sometimes deadly criminal enterprise as herdsmen in the southwest attempt to defend their cattle with traditional spears against increasingly armed professional rustlers.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of yūrei-zu <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in the manga of Shigeru Mizuki (b. 1922) and Hiroshi Shiibashi (b. 1980), {{both of whom}} are renowned for their works dealing with traditional Japanese aspects of the supernatural.|$|E
25|$|Modern Laconophilia {{has been}} present in popular culture, {{particularly}} {{with reference to}} the Battle of Thermopylae, as portrayed in films such as The 300 Spartans. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in the graphic novel 300 and the film derived from it.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The Ottoman {{inscription}} {{above the}} gate. Various architectural spolia, embedded into the masonry as decorative elements, <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident.</b>|$|R
60|$|Leland {{looked at}} her, {{and though she}} saw the blood creep slowly into his face, his {{restraint}} <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cold {{hammered}} copper daggers, and a {{few instances}} of iron <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident.</b> Bone antecedents show {{the development of the}} form.|$|R
25|$|Russell's {{influence}} <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in {{the work}} of Alfred J. Ayer, Rudolf Carnap, Alonzo Church, Kurt Gödel, David Kaplan, Saul Kripke, Karl Popper, W. V. Quine, John R. Searle, {{and a number of other}} philosophers and logicians.|$|E
25|$|The Rhynie chert, by {{preserving}} {{a snapshot}} of an ecosystem in situ in high fidelity, gives {{a unique opportunity to}} observe interactions between species and kingdoms. There is evidence of parasitic behaviour by fungi on algae Palaeonitella, provoking a hypertrophic response. Herbivory <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident,</b> judging by boring and piercing wounds in various states of repair, and the mouthparts of arthropods.|$|E
25|$|The {{revenues}} of the OREPA barely cover operating costs, leaving insufficient resources for maintenance and no resources to self-finance investments. This problem <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in {{the myriad of}} community-operated and privately operated smaller systems throughout the country. Sometimes water is cut off to enforce payments, partly because payments cannot be enforced through the legal system. However, many customers reconnect illegally.|$|E
50|$|While decentralised {{systems can}} easily be found in nature, they <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in aspects of human society such as {{governmental}} and economic systems.|$|R
50|$|German air-ground {{coordination}} <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in the 1940 German {{campaign in}} the Low Countries and France. The continental air defences were not well organized.|$|R
30|$|Variations of {{temperature}} and moisture over the array <b>are</b> <b>also</b> shown in Fig. 3 b and c, respectively. These variations are strongly {{dominated by the}} diurnal cycle, although longer-scale gradual increases {{of temperature}} and moisture <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident.</b> The strong diurnal variations <b>were</b> <b>also</b> captured by TB (IR), as shown in Fig. 3 d. The TRMM 3 B 42 rain (Fig. 3 e) also shows diurnal peaks, though the rainfall amount varied day to day. Similar strong diurnal cycles near Jakarta <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in previous studies (e.g., Araki et al. 2006).|$|R
25|$|The {{previous}} volcanic edifice {{was destroyed}} by this eruption, which may have formed a caldera. The vent was no wider than , as it is completely hidden beneath the western cone. Such a vent or caldera is substantially smaller than the volume of rocks erupted, a discrepancy that <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in the 1932 eruption of Quizapu. The Soncor magma chamber {{may have been too}} deep to collapse when it was emptied.|$|E
25|$|The tubular {{systems are}} {{fundamental}} to tall building design. Most buildings over 40-stories constructed since the 1960s now use a tube design derived from Khan's structural engineering principles, examples including {{the construction of}} the World Trade Center, Aon Center, Petronas Towers, Jin Mao Building, and most other supertall skyscrapers since the 1960s. The strong influence of tube structure design <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in {{the construction of the}} current tallest skyscraper, the Burj Khalifa.|$|E
25|$|J. K.'s legacy <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in his company’s {{charitable}} work. He {{established the}} Lilly tradition of providing aid to disaster victims. While he was company president, Eli Lilly and Company sent medicine and {{supplies to the}} victims of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. He also set a company precedent in 1919 that continued during the Great Depression. Instead of layoffs, which most companies did to cut expenses, Lilly's company reduced employee work hours, but increased wages to compensate for the loss of income.|$|E
5000|$|Zurvanism: By late Achaemenid times, Zoroastrianism <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> as Zurvanism (Zurvanite Zoroastrianism), a monist dualism {{that had}} a {{following}} {{as late as the}} Sassanid era.|$|R
50|$|Just as {{individual}} people differ in scalp hair color, {{they can also}} differ in pubic hair color. Differences in thickness, growth rate, and length <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident.</b>|$|R
3000|$|Trends as {{the number}} of qubits {{increases}} from 1 to 3 <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in Figure  5. In panels (a) and (d) the trend is monotonic: For [...]...|$|R
25|$|The Zurvanite “twin brother” {{doctrine}} <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in Zurvanism’s cosmogonical creation myth, {{that in its}} ‘classic’ form, {{does not}} contradict the Mazdean model of the origin and evolution of the universe, which begins where the Zurvanite model ends. It may well be (as proposed by Cumont and Schaeder) that the Zurvanite cosmogony was an adaptation of an antecedent Hellenic Chronos cosmogony that portrayed Infinite Time as the “Father of Time” (not {{to be confused with}} the Titan, Cronus, father of Zeus) whom the Greeks equated with Oromasdes, i.e. Ohrmuzd/Ahura Mazda.|$|E
25|$|Ian {{provides}} the series with an action-orientated figure, {{able to perform}} the physical tasks that the elderly Doctor cannot. His concern, above all, is {{for the safety of}} the TARDIS crew, and in the early stories he often takes issue with the Doctor's habit of placing the group in harm's way just to satisfy his own curiosity. The chemistry between Barbara and himself <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident,</b> although the nature of their relationship is never made explicit in the television series, and their eventual marriage is only revealed forty-five years later.|$|E
25|$|For {{prospective}} memory, the {{parietal lobe}} {{is important for}} recognizing cues that trigger an intended action, especially when the cues are visual or spatial. The parietal lobe is also responsible for maintaining attention on the intended action and inhibiting other activities during performance. Studies using PET {{have shown that the}} parietal lobe is activated when participants engage in prospective memory tasks involving visual information such as remembering a series of numbers. Activation of the parietal lobe <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident</b> in studies using magnetoencephalography (MEG) which traces electric activity of the brain.|$|E
50|$|The {{inhabitants}} of the province is mostly of pure/mixed Austronesian stock, with some people of Chinese and Arab heritage. Spanish and American ancestries <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>evident,</b> albeit a minor percentage.|$|R
