25|$|Over {{the past}} six months, {{as chair of the}} Co-operative Commission, I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hearing</b> {{evidence}} from organisations and individuals {{with a wide range of}} views on the direction that the movement should take. My colleagues and I have been impressed by many things: first and foremost, the goodwill towards the co-operative movement that is to be found in many, many places. There is also a willingness to embrace change and an awareness that no change is not an option.|$|E
2500|$|In 1930, Kirchner {{began to}} {{experience}} health problems due to smoking and in 1931 Erna had to undergo surgery in Berlin {{due to a}} suspected growth. In 1931, he was made {{a member of the}} Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. As the Nazi party took power in Germany, it became impossible for Kirchner to sell his paintings. In 1933, he was forced to resign from the Prussian Academy of Arts. Kirchner became increasingly disturbed by the situation in Germany, writing: [...] "Here we <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hearing</b> terrible rumours about torture of the Jews, but it’s all surely untrue. I’m a little tired and sad about the situation up there. There is a war in the air. In the museums, the hard-won cultural achievements of the last 20 years are being destroyed, and yet the reason why we founded the Brücke was to encourage truly German art, made in Germany. And now {{it is supposed to be}} un-German. Dear God. It does upset me".|$|E
2500|$|During Wolfowitz's pre-war {{testimony}} before Congress, he dismissed General Eric K. Shinseki's {{estimates of the}} size of the post war occupation force which would be needed. General Shinseki testified to the US Senate Armed Services Committee on February 25, 2003 that [...] "something in the order of several hundred thousand soldiers" [...] would probably be required for postwar Iraq. [...] By contrast, Wolfowitz estimated that fewer than 100,000 troops would be necessary in Iraq. Two days after Shinseki testified, Wolfowitz said to the House Budget Committee on February 27, 2003:There has been a good deal of comment—some of it quite outlandish—about what our postwar requirements might be in Iraq. Some of the higher end predictions we <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hearing</b> recently, such as the notion that it will take several hundred thousand U.S. troops to provide stability in post-Saddam Iraq, are wildly off the mark. It is hard to conceive that it would take more forces to provide stability in post-Saddam Iraq than it would take to conduct the war itself and to secure the surrender of Saddam's security forces and his army—hard to imagine.|$|E
40|$|This thesis studies {{whether the}} Roberts Court <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hearing</b> more {{important}} issues than the Warren, Burger or Rehnquist Courts. I operationalize important issues as pre-decision salience and measure mentions {{of cases in}} the first section of two newspapers. The research shows that the Roberts Court <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hearing</b> more important issues than the other modern Courts. I reason that the Roberts Court <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hearing</b> more important issues because interest groups and individuals are turning to the Court to make policy. Because the Court is becoming a more important policymaking institution, scrutiny of the Supreme Court will increase...|$|R
