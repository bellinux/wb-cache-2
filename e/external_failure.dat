DFI may naturally be called for in redesign of a product to reduce that cost component when it is high. However, DFI will not always reduce inspection costs: it can also lead to increased rate of inspection, because more convenient or higher quality measurement may justify increasing measurements, say from a sampling rate satisfactory to support a basic level of tolerance to a higher rate (e.g. to 100%). Or DFI may make it economical for 100% inspections to measure more features or to make repeated measures of the same feature at different points within the manufacturing process.

40|$|In today's highly {{competitive}} markets manufacturers must provide high quality products to survive. Manufacturers can achieve {{higher levels of}} quality by changing their manufacturing process and/or by product inspection where a multitude of different strategies are often available. Each option has its own cost implications that {{must also be taken}} into account. By reconciling the competing objectives of quality maximization and cost minimization, a cost of quality approach serves as a useful framework for comparing available manufacturing process and inspection alternatives. Still, any rigorous comparison requires both a metric as well as a profound understanding of cost of quality tradeoffs. The cost of quality tradeoffs in manufacturing process and inspection strategy selection are examined through a probabilistic cost of quality model explored analytically using a sample set of fundamental inspection strategies (reinspect rejects, reinspect accepts and single inspection) and applied to the case of electric vehicle battery pack assembly. From an expected value point of view a series of parametric sensitivity analyses reveal that complex tradeoffs between manufacturing process, inspection, internal and <b>external</b> <b>failure</b> costs determine the optimal manufacturing process and inspection strategy combination. In general, reinspect rejects minimizes internal failure costs, reinspect accepts minimizes <b>external</b> <b>failure</b> costs and single inspection lies in between while minimizing inspection costs. This thesis illustrates the fact that results are scenario specific and depend on product cost-, manufacturing process and available inspection method attributes. It is also observed that manufacturing process improvement often coincides with a need to change inspection strategy choice, thereby indicating that manufacturing process and inspection strategy selection should not be performed independently of each other. This thesis demonstrates that the traditional expected value approach for evaluating cost of quality implications of manufacturing and inspection is often misleading. Decision tree formulations and discrete event simulations indicate that cost of quality distributions are asymmetric. High internal- and <b>external</b> <b>failure</b> costs, manufacturing process non-conformance rates and inspection method error rates are contributing factors. The alternative metric of expected utility captures decision makers risk aversion to high cost outliers and changes the criteria for optimality and favors inspection strategies and manufacturing processes that minimize <b>external</b> <b>failure</b> events with increasing risk intolerance. In the examined case of electric vehicle battery pack assembly both material- and <b>external</b> <b>failure</b> costs are very high. Analytical and discrete event simulation results indicate that for the given welding process the inspection strategy that minimizes <b>external</b> <b>failure</b> costs is optimal from an expected cost point of view as well as at high degrees of risk aversion. This result is shown to be sensitive to parameters driving the cost and probability of <b>external</b> <b>failure</b> events. by Hadi Zaklouta. Thesis (S. M.)

We consider a setting where a risk neutral supplier sells an intermediate product to a risk neutral buyer. The supplier incurs prevention costs to reduce the probability of selling a defective product, and the buyer incurs appraisal costs to identify defects. Both decisions are subject to moral hazard. We show that the first-best outcome can be obtained if either: (i) the supplier's prevention decision is contractible; or (ii) the buyer's appraisal decision and either internal failure (i. e., the product's failing the buyer's appraisal test) or <b>external</b> <b>failure</b> (i. e., the product's failing after being sold by the buyer) are contractible events; or (iii) both internal and <b>external</b> <b>failure</b> are contractible events. We then focus on the second-best setting where actions and failures are not contractible and study the effect of making the buyer's appraisal result contractible. Relative to first-best, if a buyer's return decision is contractible (but not his appraisal result), the supplier incurs lower prevention costs, the buyer incurs higher appraisal costs, expected internal failure costs are higher, and the total cost of quality is higher. The expected costs of <b>external</b> <b>failure,</b> however, may actually be lower relative to first-best. We then show that installing an information system that makes the appraisal result contractible reduces the inefficiency associated with the seller's prevention activity, increases the inefficiency associated with the buyer's quality appraisal activity, and unambiguously improves product quality. information, incentives, quality costs, supply chain...|$|E

We model the contracting relationship between a supplier and a buyer. The supplier is privately informed about the outcome of his design/production investment. The buyer both appraises the supplier's component and does further processing/component production of his own. If the final product produced by the buyer exhibits decoupling and no function sharing {{with respect to the}} components (termed separable architecture), the first-best outcome is attained if both internal and external failures are contractible. When only one type of failure can be contracted on, we derive conditions under which contracting on internal failure is superior to contracting on <b>external</b> <b>failure,</b> and vice versa. If the buyer's final product has a nonseparable architecture with respect to the components, first-best cannot be achieved even if both internal and external failures are contractible. The value of contracting on internal failure alone is unaffected by the architecture design, while that of <b>external</b> <b>failure</b> declines relative to the separable setting; the net result is often to make the former the uniformly dominant performance metric. Our results highlight the interaction between the performance metrics used for contracting within the supply chain, the architecture of the product produced by the supply chain, and the incentive efficiency of the chain.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to to determine the effectiveness of the company's quality improvement program on quality and cost efficiency that has been issued by the company. The analysis used to measure the cost of quality is to use a measurement of quality cost to sales percentage. Results of analysis of quality cost reports based on sales show that the total cost of quality from year 2002 - 2006 no more than the general standard of quality costs 2. 5 % of sales. However, companies can not reach the standard of zero damage (zero defect) due to the persistence of internal and <b>external</b> <b>failure</b> costs. Nevertheless, there is a tendency toward zero defect companies can take place because the percentage of the cost of failure, especially <b>external</b> <b>failure</b> costs in a relatively small company. Quality improvement program in the year 2002 - 2004 has not been effectively implemented due to the total cost of the quality of 0. 616 % (in 2002), 1. 080 % (year 2003) and 1. 004 % (in 2004) was not able to achieve company goals to improve product quality and consumer satisfaction shown by the increase in internal and <b>external</b> <b>failure</b> costs. Meanwhile, in the year 2004 - 2006 quality improvement program has been implemented effectively due to the total cost of the quality of 1. 004 % (in 2004), 0. 685 % (in 2005) and 0. 486 % (in 2006) are able to achieve company goals to improve product quality and consumer satisfaction shown by the decrease in internal and <b>external</b> <b>failure</b> costs. Results of analysis of quality cost report One Year Trend shows that only in 2003 the company has not been able to achieve cost efficiency with quality shown an increase in the total quality cost to sales from 0. 616 % to 1. 080 % and the increase in control costs Rp. 226, 575, 475. 00 followed by an increase in total cost of Rp failure. 11, 558, 450. 00. As for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 showed that the cost of quality issued by the company has been efficient with the total quality cost to sales, which dropped by as much as 0. 486 % and the trade-offs between cost control and cost of failure resulting in a favorable variance for the company as a whole.

Quality costs are the type of costs which arise due to the activities implemented in order to preclude possible flaws, to the planned quality tests,and to flaws that appear during the production or customer delivery processes. Quality costs are classified in British Standards 6143 as follows:(a) Prevention Costs(b) Appraisal Costs(c) Internal Failure Costs(d) <b>External</b> <b>Failure</b> CostsAs regards quality costs, occupational accidents that may produce highly excessive costs can be prevented by executing {{a good number of}} prevention activities.

The methodology is based on quantifying the four types of quality-related costs in residential construction, and relates them to each other by expressing them all as percentages of the relevant total construction revenues (revenues to the company due to construction, excluding land, etc.). The findings reaffirm, on the one hand, that investing in quality is a worthy strategy and that, in the situations examined, {{the ratio of the}} direct benefits to the investment (in terms of savings on internal and <b>external</b> <b>failures)</b> is at least 2 : 1. On the other hand, the findings also show that an excess of quality costs (prevention and appraisal) is wasteful.

Statistically fitted graphs, based on actual quantitative data, support this hypothesis, and provide approximate boundaries of effective versus ineffective investments in quality. In this study, the optimal range lies between 2 % and 4 % of the company's revenue.

While in literature assembly line balancing and inspection policy design have usually been addressed as different problems, they are strongly interrelated. Inspection tests requires time to be performed and thus their assignation directly influences {{the results of the}} assembly line balancing procedure, that is the number of stations that are necessary and hence the line installation cost. Provided what said above, the advantage of integrating inspection policy design in assembly line balancing appears clear, but to our knowledge there is not such a model yet. In this paper a new model that defines simultaneously inspection policy and assembly line balancing is presented...|$|E
40|$|In past studies it {{has been}} shown that the {{fracture}} of materials leads to the emission of a variety of species, including electrons, ions, neutral molecules, and photons, all encompassed by the term 'fractoemission' (FE). In this paper, electron emission (EE) from the fracture of single graphite fibers and neat epoxy resin is examined. Measurements of EE are also combined with the detection of acoustic emission (AE) during the testing of graphite-epoxy composite specimens with various fiber orientation. The characteristics of these signals are related to known failure mechanisms in fiber-reinforced plastics. This study suggests that by comparing data from AE and FE measurements, one can detect and distinguish the onset of internal and <b>external</b> <b>failure</b> in composites. EE measurements are also shown to be sensitive to the locus of fracture in a composite material...|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been made {{over a period of}} four years of the use of quality costing by three {{individual}} manufacturers of coatings for industrial and decorative use. The experience indicates that diferences in manufacturing processes, products, markets and systems all combine to prevent one company’s quality costing system from being used effectively by another. It was found that the establishment of a reliable and well-developed management information system is of considerable importance to the establishment of a quality costing system. It is also pointed out that the early reporting of some costs such as internal and <b>external</b> <b>failure</b> in advance of the development of a complete quality costing system was found to be beneficial in getting the concept of quality costing accepted and making good use of the data. Key words: quality costing, coating manufacture, difficulties encountered, system development...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A vapor {{absorption}} machine (VAM) is {{a machine}} that produces chilled water using a waste heat source rather than electrical input as in the more familiar vapor compression cycle. Vapor absorption machine works {{on the principle of}} absorption refrigeration cycle. Vapor absorption machine consists of two rectangular pressure vessel shells. Both shells operate under vacuum. As these pressure vessels are subjected to vacuum, there is a chance of <b>external</b> pressure <b>failure.</b> Therefore, design of components of vapor absorption machine is carried out using ASME and TEMA code. Design pressure is 1 Bar and design temperature is 150 o 8...|$|R
30|$|There {{are many}} <b>external</b> causes of <b>failure</b> {{of the shaft}} that can be {{eliminated}} by changing the entire design of the oven, {{something that is not}} possible, very expensive and time consuming. Instead of changing the design of the whole; it would be better and simpler to change only the design of the roller shaft as described in our article, adopting a hollow shaft.|$|R

Uncorrected, drilling holes wandered 22 degrees or more off course. As the field's high-pressure gas expanded, it cooled rapidly freezing production equipment. This complicated the production process. Other problems involved <b>external</b> corrosion, casing <b>failures,</b> sulfide stress corrosion cracking, corrosion inside oil storage tanks, and the cold winters.|$|R
