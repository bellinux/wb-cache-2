25|$|Like {{the apex}} graphs and the linkless <b>embeddable</b> graphs, the YΔY-reducible graphs are closed under graph minors. And, like the linkless <b>embeddable</b> graphs, the YΔY-reducible graphs have the seven graphs in the Petersen family as {{forbidden}} minors, prompting {{the question of}} whether these are the only forbidden minors and whether the YΔY-reducible graphs are the same as the linkless <b>embeddable</b> graphs. However, Neil Robertson provided an example of an apex graph that is not YΔY-reducible. Since every apex graph is linkless <b>embeddable,</b> this shows that there are graphs that are linkless <b>embeddable</b> but not YΔY-reducible and therefore that there are additional forbidden minors for the YΔY-reducible graphs.|$|E
25|$|Flat embeddings are {{automatically}} linkless, but not vice versa. The complete graph K6, the Petersen graph, {{and the other}} five graphs in the Petersen family do not have linkless embeddings. Every graph minor of a linklessly <b>embeddable</b> graph is again linklessly <b>embeddable,</b> as is every graph that can be reached from a linklessly <b>embeddable</b> graph by a Y-Δ transform. The linklessly <b>embeddable</b> graphs have the Petersen family graphs as their forbidden minors, and include the planar graphs and apex graphs. They may be recognized, and a flat embedding may be constructed for them, in linear time.|$|E

25|$|Apex graphs {{are also}} linklessly <b>embeddable</b> in {{three-dimensional}} space: {{they can be}} embedded {{in such a way}} that each cycle in the graph is the boundary of a disk that is not crossed by any other feature of the graph. A drawing of this type may be obtained by drawing the planar part of the graph in a plane, placing the apex above the plane, and connecting the apex by straight-line edges to each of its neighbors. Linklessly <b>embeddable</b> graphs form a minor-closed family with the seven graphs in the Petersen family as their minimal forbidden minors; therefore, these graphs are also forbidden as minors for the apex graphs. However, there exist linklessly <b>embeddable</b> graphs that are not apex graphs.|$|E
25|$|Any graph may be {{embedded}} into three-dimensional space without crossings. However, {{a three-dimensional}} analogue of the planar graphs {{is provided by}} the linklessly <b>embeddable</b> graphs, graphs that can be embedded into three-dimensional space {{in such a way that}} no two cycles are topologically linked with each other. In analogy to Kuratowski's and Wagner's characterizations of the planar graphs as being the graphs that do not contain K5 or K3,3 as a minor, the linklessly <b>embeddable</b> graphs may be characterized as the graphs that do not contain as a minor any of the seven graphs in the Petersen family. In analogy to the characterizations of the outerplanar and planar graphs as being the graphs with Colin de Verdière graph invariant at most two or three, the linklessly <b>embeddable</b> graphs are the graphs that have Colin de Verdière invariant at most four.|$|E

25|$|Many {{families}} of graphs have the property that every minor of a graph in F {{is also in}} F; such a class {{is said to be}} minor-closed. For instance, in any planar graph, or any embedding of a graph on a fixed topological surface, neither the removal of edges nor the contraction of edges can increase the genus of the embedding; therefore, planar graphs and the graphs <b>embeddable</b> on any fixed surface form minor-closed families.|$|E
25|$|If a graph G has a linkless or flat embedding, {{then every}} minor of G (a graph formed by {{contraction}} of edges and deletion of edges and vertices) {{also has a}} linkless or flat embedding. Deletions cannot destroy the flatness of an embedding, and a contraction can be performed by leaving one endpoint of the contracted edge in place and rerouting all the edges incident to the other endpoint along {{the path of the}} contracted edge. Therefore, by the Robertson–Seymour theorem, the linklessly <b>embeddable</b> graphs have a forbidden graph characterization as the graphs that do not contain any of a finite set of minors.|$|E

25|$|The planar graphs and {{the apex}} graphs are linklessly <b>embeddable,</b> {{as are the}} graphs {{obtained}} by Y-Δ transforms from these graphs. The YΔY reducible graphs are the graphs that {{can be reduced to}} a single vertex by Y-Δ transforms, removal of isolated vertices and degree-one vertices, and compression of degree-two vertices; they are also minor-closed, and include all planar graphs. However, there exist linkless graphs that are not YΔY reducible, such as the apex graph formed by connecting an apex vertex to every degree-three vertex of a rhombic dodecahedron. There also exist linkless graphs that cannot be transformed into an apex graph by Y-Δ transforms, removal of isolated vertices and degree-one vertices, and compression of degree-two vertices: for instance, the ten-vertex crown graph has a linkless embedding, but cannot be transformed into an apex graph in this way.|$|E

500|$|The {{marching band}} video sparked much {{controversy}} online immediately after its release. [...] Because of deals between the band's label, EMI (through Capitol Records), and YouTube, the video was not <b>embeddable,</b> {{nor was it}} viewable across the globe, frustrating many fans and music industry professionals who wanted to post the video on their blogs. The band, led by singer Damian Kulash, explained the label's rationale via the band's blog and through an op-ed piece in The New York Times. [...] According to Kulash, EMI disallowed the <b>embeddable</b> play of the video because they only receive royalties for views on the YouTube site itself. He further pleaded to allow embedding of their next video, citing a 90% drop in viewership when EMI disabled embedding on existing videos, affecting the band's own royalties from viewership.|$|E

It also opened up new data visualization APIs for TV news and other media outlets, enabling them {{to search for a}} word and see a firehose of public posts that mention it as well as show how many people mentioned a word in both public and private posts during a set time frame, with a demographic breakdown of the age, gender, and location of these people. In January 2014, Facebook announced a partnership with UK-based social TV analytics company SecondSync which saw the social network make its social TV available outside the company for the first time. Facebook struck the partnership to help marketers understand how people are using the social network to talk about topics such as TV. However, Twitter responded by acquiring SecondSync and Parisian social TV firm Mesagraph three months later. These acquisitions, as well as a partnership with research company Kantar (which it had been working with to develop a suite of analytics tools for the British TV industry since August 2013) strengthened Twitter's dominance of the [...] "second screen" [...] – TV viewers using tablets and smartphones to share their TV experience on social media. With the additional analytic tools, Twitter was able to improve the firm's offering to advertisers, allowing them to, for instance, only promote a tweet onto the timelines of users who were watching a certain programme.|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} of whether K6 has a linkless or flat embedding was posed within the topology research community in the early 1970s by [...] Linkless embeddings {{were brought to the}} attention of the graph theory community by , who posed several related problems including the problem of finding a forbidden graph characterization of the graphs with linkless and flat embeddings; Sachs showed that the seven graphs of the Petersen family (including K6) do not have such embeddings. As [...] observed, linklessly <b>embeddable</b> graphs are closed under graph minors, from which it follows by the Robertson–Seymour theorem that a forbidden graph characterization exists. The proof of the existence of a finite set of obstruction graphs does not lead to an explicit description of this set of forbidden minors, but it follows from Sachs' results that the seven graphs of the Petersen family belong to the set. [...] These problems were finally settled by , who showed that the seven graphs of the Petersen family are the only minimal forbidden minors for these graphs. Therefore, linklessly <b>embeddable</b> graphs and flat <b>embeddable</b> graphs are both the same set of graphs, and are both the same as the graphs that have no Petersen family minor.|$|E
2500|$|The set of {{forbidden}} minors for the linklessly <b>embeddable</b> graphs {{was identified}} by : the seven graphs of the Petersen family are all minor-minimal intrinsically linked graphs.

2500|$|... {{also asked}} for bounds {{on the number}} of edges and the {{chromatic}} number of linkless <b>embeddable</b> graphs. The number of edges in an n-vertex linkless graph is at most 4n10: maximal apex graphs with n>4 have exactly this many edges, and [...] proved a matching upper bound on the more general class of K6-minor-free graphs. [...] observed that Sachs' question about the chromatic number would be resolved by a proof of Hadwiger's conjecture that any k-chromatic graph has as a minor a k-vertex complete graph. The proof by [...] of the case k=6 of Hadwiger's conjecture is sufficient to settle Sachs' question: the linkless graphs can be colored with at most five colors, as any 6-chromatic graph contains a K6 minor and is not linkless, and there exist linkless graphs such as K5 that require five colors. The snark theorem implies that every cubic linklessly <b>embeddable</b> graph is 3-edge-colorable.|$|E
2500|$|... {{proved the}} {{conjecture}} for k=6, also using the four color theorem; their paper with this proof won the 1994 Fulkerson Prize. It follows from their proof that linklessly <b>embeddable</b> graphs, a three-dimensional analogue of planar graphs, have chromatic number at most five. Due to this result, the conjecture {{is known to}} be true for k≤6, but it remains unsolved for all k>6.|$|E

2500|$|In topological graph theory, a {{mathematical}} discipline, a linkless embedding of an undirected graph is an embedding of the graph into Euclidean space {{in such a}} way that no two cycles of the graph are linked. A flat embedding is an embedding with the property that every cycle is the boundary of a topological disk whose interior is disjoint from the graph. A [...] linklessly <b>embeddable</b> graph is a graph that has a linkless or flat embedding; these graphs form a three-dimensional analogue of the planar graphs. Complementarily, an intrinsically linked graph is a graph that does not have a linkless embedding.|$|E
2500|$|The Colin de Verdière graph {{invariant}} is {{an integer}} defined for any graph using algebraic graph theory. The graphs with Colin de Verdière graph invariant at most μ, for any fixed constant μ, form a minor-closed family, {{and the first}} few of these are well-known: the graphs with μ ≤ 1 are the linear forests (disjoint unions of paths), the graphs with μ ≤ 2 are the outerplanar graphs, and the graphs with μ ≤ 3 are the planar graphs. As [...] conjectured and [...] proved, the graphs with μ ≤ 4 are exactly the linklessly <b>embeddable</b> graphs.|$|E
2500|$|Linkless embeddings started {{being studied}} within the {{algorithms}} research {{community in the}} late 1980s through the works of [...] and [...] Algorithmically, the problem of recognizing linkless and flat <b>embeddable</b> graphs was settled once the forbidden minor characterization was proven: an algorithm of [...] {{can be used to}} test in polynomial time whether a given graph contains any of the seven forbidden minors. This method does not construct linkless or flat embeddings when they exist, but an algorithm that does construct an embedding was developed by , and a more efficient linear time algorithm was found by [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{forbidden}} minor {{characterization of}} linkless graphs {{leads to a}} polynomial time algorithm for their recognition, but not for actually constructing an embedding. [...] described a linear time algorithm that tests whether a graph is linklessly <b>embeddable</b> and, if so, constructs a flat embedding of the graph. Their algorithm finds large planar subgraphs within the given graph such that, if a linkless embedding exists, it has to respect the planar embedding of the subgraph. By repeatedly simplifying the graph whenever such a subgraph is found, they reduce the problem to {{one in which the}} remaining graph has bounded treewidth, at which point it can be solved by dynamic programming.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{not every}} monoid sits inside a group. For instance, it is {{perfectly}} {{possible to have a}} monoid in which two elements a and b exist such that [...] holds even though b is not the identity element. Such a monoid cannot be embedded in a group, because in the group we could multiply both sides with the inverse of a and would get that , which isn't true. A monoid [...] has the cancellation property (or is cancellative) if for all a, b and c in M, [...] always implies [...] and [...] always implies [...] A commutative monoid with the cancellation property can always be embedded in a group via the Grothendieck construction. That is how the additive group of the integers (a group with operation +) is constructed from the additive monoid of natural numbers (a commutative monoid with operation + and cancellation property). However, a non-commutative cancellative monoid need not be <b>embeddable</b> in a group.|$|E
