5|$|Sen, No-Face and Boh {{meet with}} the now benevolent Zeniba, who reveals that Sen's love for Haku broke her curse and that Yubaba used the black slug to control Haku. Haku appears in his dragon form and flies Sen and Boh to the bathhouse. No-Face becomes Zeniba's spinner. In midflight, Sen recalls falling in her youth into the Kohaku River and being washed safely ashore, thus {{revealing}} Haku's real identity as the Kohaku River. When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba forces Sen to identify her parents from {{among a group of}} pigs in order to break their curse. After Sen answers that none of the pigs are her parents, her contract combusts and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the now dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro crosses the riverbed to her restored parents, who do not remember anything. They quietly walk back to their car (which is now covered <b>in</b> <b>dust)</b> and drive away.|$|E
5|$|The {{film is a}} {{depiction}} of various scenes, usually violent or bizarre, that somehow relate to hunting. Each scenario is presented {{one after the other}} with little regard for narrative continuity. The opening scene introduces a Patagonian hunter who hunts stags to survive. The opening credits play over as he chases after a stag, which he ultimately shoots, kills, and beheads. Afterwards, one of the numerous scenes of anti-hunting gatherings is shown, this one in Cape Cod. The attention quickly shifts to wildlife hunting, where a monkey is killed by a leopard, and then a squirrel monkey by an anaconda. The theme changes again to the social hunt of wild game in Australia and Africa. Aborigines hunt kangaroos and other large marsupials with spears and giant bats with boomerangs. Indigenous tribes of Africa hunt large game, including antelope, buffalo, and elephants, in the savanna. Religious ceremonies are also shown, where the African hunters proceed to suck fresh blood from the entrails of an antelope, and the Australian aborigines symbolically bury their prey <b>in</b> <b>dust</b> to placate the spirits of the animals. Lastly, two brothers are arrested after partaking in a form of ritual post-mortem cannibalism of three of their relatives to acquire the hunting skills of the dead.|$|E

40|$|Road dusts were {{collected}} from an area where intense mechanical recycling of plastic wastes occurs in Wen'an, north China. These dusts were investigated for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and heavy metals contamination to assess the health risk related to these components. Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE- 209) and I 21 PBDE pound concentrations <b>in</b> these <b>dusts</b> ranged from 2. 67 to 10, 424 ng g(- 1) and from 3. 23 to 10, 640 ng g(- 1), respectively. These PBDE concentrations were comparable to those observed <b>in</b> road <b>dust</b> from e-waste recycling areas but were 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than concentrations in outdoor or road dusts from other areas. This indicates that road <b>dusts</b> <b>in</b> the study area {{have high levels of}} PBDE pollution. BDE- 209 was the predominant congener, accounting for 86. 3 % of the total PBDE content <b>in</b> <b>dusts.</b> Thus, commercial deca-BDE products were the dominant source. The average concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Sb, and Zn <b>in</b> these same <b>dust</b> samples were 10. 1, 0. 495, 112, 54. 7, 0. 150, 71. 8, 10. 6, and 186 mg kg(- 1), respectively. The geoaccumulation index suggests that road <b>dusts</b> <b>in</b> this area are moderately to heavily polluted with Cd, Hg, and Sb. This study shows that plastic waste processing is a major source of toxic pollutants <b>in</b> road <b>dusts</b> <b>in</b> this area. Although the health risk from exposure to dust PBDEs was low, levels of some heavy metals <b>in</b> this <b>dust</b> exceeded acceptable risk levels for children and are of great concern...|$|R

25|$|The name {{silicosis}} (from the Latin silex, or flint) {{was originally}} used in 1870 by Achille Visconti (1836–1911), prosector in the Ospedale Maggiore of Milan. The recognition of respiratory problems from breathing <b>in</b> <b>dust</b> dates to ancient Greeks and Romans. Agricola, in the mid-16th century, wrote about lung problems from dust inhalation in miners. In 1713, Bernardino Ramazzini noted asthmatic symptoms and sand-like substances {{in the lungs}} of stone cutters. With industrialization, as opposed to hand tools, came increased production of dust. The pneumatic hammer drill was introduced in 1897 and sandblasting was introduced in about 1904, both significantly contributing to the increased prevalence of silicosis.|$|E
25|$|Endosulfan is a {{ubiquitous}} environmental contaminant. The chemical is semivolatile {{and persistent}} to degradation {{processes in the}} environment. Endosulfan is subject to long-range atmospheric transport, i.e. it can travel long distances from where it is used. Thus, it occurs in many environmental compartments. For example, a 2008 report by the National Park Service found that endosulfan commonly contaminates air, water, plants, and fish of national parks in the US. Most of these parks are far from areas where endosulfan is used. Endosulfan {{has been found in}} remote locations such as the Arctic Ocean, {{as well as in the}} Antarctic atmosphere. The pesticide has also been detected <b>in</b> <b>dust</b> from the Sahara Desert collected in the Caribbean after being blown across the Atlantic Ocean. The compound has been shown to be one of the most abundant organochlorine pesticides in the global atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Another pathway of {{pollution}} occurs through the atmosphere. Wind-blown dust and debris, including plastic bags, are blown seaward from landfills and other areas. Dust from the Sahara {{moving around the}} southern periphery of the subtropical ridge moves into the Caribbean and Florida during the warm season as the ridge builds and moves northward through the subtropical Atlantic. Dust can also {{be attributed to a}} global transport from the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts across Korea, Japan, and the Northern Pacific to the Hawaiian Islands. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened due to periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability <b>in</b> <b>dust</b> transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year; however, the flux is greater during positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation. The USGS links dust events to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|According to Eve Online Creative Director Torfi Frans Ólafsson, at {{the recent}} Eve Online Fanfest, the Dominion release is planned to involve sovereignty, the {{ownership}} of districts on planets {{that are capable of}} creating industry. This player ownership system will be dynamic as it will be subject to PvP diplomacy as well as subjugation. The latter allows for linking with Dust 514, whereby players within Eve Online will be able to contract, in-game, Dust 514 players to take control of planetary regions within the Eve Online universe and these 'mercenaries' will then vie with other Dust 514 players hired by the opposing faction. The integration between the console MMOFPS game and the Eve Online MMORPG is both through community interaction and through the changeable battlefields based on the planetary architecture of a common universe—the outcome of these battles <b>in</b> <b>Dust</b> 514 will affect the status and ownership of the corresponding planets in Eve Online as well.

40|$|The {{present report}} {{addresses}} the issues whether house dust {{is likely to}} contribute substantially to the exposure of humans, in particular for the contaminants lead and asbestos. House dust consists for 30 - 70 % of soil material, indicating that contaminated soil can lead to contaminated house dust. It is concluded that exposure to lead via house dust {{should be included in}} risk assessment of soil contamination. The studies in which the amount of soil ingested by children are estimated use tracers in soil that are obviously both present in soil outdoors and in soil <b>in</b> house <b>dust.</b> Therefore, using this amount of soil ingested by children to cover both exposure of lead via soil outdoors and soil <b>in</b> house <b>dust</b> is reasonable. However, a correction factor of 2 is recommended to account for enrichment of lead <b>in</b> house <b>dust</b> <b>in</b> comparison with outdoor soil. This factor also accounts for other lead sources <b>in</b> house <b>dust</b> than contamination via soil. Significant contribution of asbestos to house dust from asbestos contaminated soil may occur at soil concentrations greater than 100 mg/kg. It is recommended to determine asbestos levels <b>in</b> house <b>dust</b> <b>in</b> houses adjacent to sites that are contaminated with asbestos above 1000 mg/kg for nonfriable asbestos, and above 100 mg/kg for friable asbestos.
