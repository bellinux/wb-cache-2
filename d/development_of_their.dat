5|$|A {{desert is}} not the kind of habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and for the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the changes}} Henry {{introduced}} during his rule had long-term consequences. His legal innovations form part of the basis for English law, with the Exchequer of Pleas a forerunner of the Common Bench at Westminster. Henry's itinerant justices also influenced his contemporaries' legal reforms: Philip Augustus' creation of itinerant bailli, for example, drew on Henry's model. Henry's intervention in Brittany, Wales and Scotland had a significant long-term impact on the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> societies and governments.|$|E
5|$|Phoronids, brachiopods and bryozoans (ectoprocts) are collectively called lophophorates, {{because all}} feed using lophophores. From about the 1940s to the 1990s, family trees based on embryological and {{morphological}} features placed lophophorates among or as a sister {{group to the}} deuterostomes, a super-phylum that includes chordates and echinoderms. In the early <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> embryos, deuterostomes form the anus before the mouth, while protostomes form the mouth first.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{schools in}} Lurgan {{operate under the}} Dickson Plan, a {{transfer}} system in north Armagh that allows pupils at age 11 the option of taking the 11-plus exam to enter grammar schools, with pupils in comprehensive junior high schools being sorted into grammar and non-grammar streams. Pupils can get promoted to or demoted from the grammar stream during their time in those schools depending on the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> academic performance, and at age 14 can take subject-based exams across the syllabus to qualify for entry into a dedicated grammar school to pursue GCSEs and A-levels.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, {{the scope}} of his work expanded. On the one hand, Phipps wished to avoid rehashing the same {{information}} that was available, but the careers of the marshals required some duplication. The published works were often filled with inconsistencies, {{not only in the}} French sources, but from the French to the English sources. The French sources frequently misinterpreted the English sources, and vice versa. Phipps wrote both an introduction to his work and a summary of the histories of the armies of the Republic and the Consulate, from 1791 to 1804, and at certain points in his narrative, he paused to review the positions of the various future marshals and other well-known generals. He reflected on the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> experience, the characteristics of their leadership, and the relationships to one another and to Napoleon. Critically, he posited that generals rarely improved with practice.|$|E

5|$|Evolve was Turtle Rock Studios' {{first major}} project {{after the company}} split from Valve Corporation in 2011. The concept for Evolve existed prior to the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{previous}} game, Left 4 Dead. Inspired by hunting games such as Cabela's Big Game Hunter and Deer Hunter, {{the idea is to}} have prey that can strike back at the hunters. The monster design was originally intended to be esoteric but was later toned down. The game is powered by Crytek's CryEngine, as they believed that the engine is capable of creating the dark and dense forests featured in the game. Turtle Rock found difficulty when seeking publishers that could provide funding and marketing for the game. THQ was originally set to serve as the game's publisher, but the rights to the franchise and publishing duties were transferred to Take-Two Interactive after THQ filed for bankruptcy in late 2012.|$|E
5|$|Henry's empire quickly {{collapsed}} {{during the}} reign of his youngest son John. Many of the changes Henry introduced during his long rule, however, had long-term consequences. Henry's legal changes are generally considered to have laid the basis for the English Common Law, while his intervention in Brittany, Wales and Scotland shaped the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> societies and governmental systems. Historical interpretations of Henry's reign have changed considerably over time. In the 18th century, scholars argued that Henry was a driving force {{in the creation of a}} genuinely English monarchy and, ultimately, a unified Britain. During the Victorian expansion of the British Empire, historians were keenly interested in the formation of Henry's own empire, but they also expressed concern over his private life and treatment of Becket. Late-20th-century historians have combined British and French historical accounts of Henry, challenging earlier Anglo-centric interpretations of his reign.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only does}} SCI present {{children}} and adolescents {{with many of the}} same difficulties adults face, it affects the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> sexuality. Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people. Injured {{children and adolescents}} need ongoing, age-appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and sexual function. Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E

5|$|On 15 January 2014, a {{spending}} bill {{passed by the}} House appropriated $100 million for the GCV program, even though the Army had requested $592 million for the program for FY 2014. The Army planned to spend 80 percent of its ground vehicle modernization budget on the GCV over the next 5 years, with costs ranging from $29-$34 billion depending on overruns and setbacks. Several options were being considered to make the program more affordable, including reducing the squad size from their optimum goal of nine men and using new emerging, and undeveloped, technologies to reduce {{the weight of the}} vehicle to 30 tons for operations in urban environments. The two contractors would run out of money for <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> prototype vehicles by June 2014 unless the Army funded the rest of the technology development phase. The Pentagon and Army tried to find ways to continue the program, without actually starting vehicle production, through new technologies like advanced fire control systems and hybrid engines. Although the Army wanted 1,894 Ground Combat Vehicles with a target price of $9–10.5 million per unit, the Pentagon's Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation estimated a unit cost of up to $17 million. The 83-percent cut in funding essentially scaled back the GCV program to a research effort. The program had declined in support over the past months with the Army determining that the desired vehicle was no longer feasible in the near term due to budget reductions, suspicion from the contractors that the program would not move past technology development, and Congress's believing it would not succeed.|$|E
