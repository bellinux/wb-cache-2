40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} a new mining-based file caching scheme for a hybrid storage disk system. In particular, we focus our efforts on {{reducing}} the latency of launching applications. The proposed scheme identifies the correlated file accesses in a file access sequence via sequential pattern mining algorithm. Our scheme caches corre-lated files together {{to maximize the}} caching efficiency. The correlated files are extracted from the access patterns through the proposed mining scheme, which consists of three steps: frequent pattern based file extraction, cluster moving gap based <b>file</b> <b>sort,</b> and fre-quency and size based file prioritization. The extracted correlated files are relocated to a SSD during idle time. DiskSim and NANDSim are {{used to evaluate the}} proposed scheme, called Informed Mining. The proposed scheme is compared with a disk only scheme and five other mining based file relocation schemes: Mining based file reloca-tion scheme (Miner), minimum distance based file relocation scheme (Min_Dist), fre-quency-based relocation scheme (Fre), size-based relocation scheme (Size), and one that relocates files with highest value of (file size * file access number) first to the SSD (Fr*Sz). From the simulation based experiment, launch time is reduced by about 50 % using only 10 % of sum of all file sizes accessed during a launch of an application...|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} programming a control break {{is a change}} in the value of one of the keys on which a <b>file</b> is <b>sorted</b> which requires some extra processing. For example, with an input <b>file</b> <b>sorted</b> by post code, the number of items found in each postal district might need to be printed on a report, and a heading shown for the next district. Quite often there is a hierarchy of nested control breaks in a program, e.g. streets within districts within areas, with the need for a grand total at the end. Structured programming techniques have been developed to ensure correct processing of control breaks in languages such as COBOL and to ensure that conditions such as empty input files and sequence errors are handled properly.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{the first}} phase of <b>sorting</b> a large <b>file,</b> <b>sorted</b> sequences, called runs, are generated. In the second phase, the runs are merged into a <b>sorted</b> <b>file.</b> The merge time can be much greater than the runs-generation time. Generating longer runs and thus fewer runs in {{the first phase}} may greatly reduce the merge time. In this paper, we present a {{parallel}} algorithm that can utilize the broadcast capability of the IBM SP 2 to generate long runs. The new algorithm has been implemented in C and PVMe. Experimental results show that our algorithm generates longer runs than two earlier algorithms, and is more desirable...|$|R

Hence patient file traceability must be managed carefully in order to avoid file loss and improve <b>file</b> <b>sorting</b> in the archive department. This paper aims at proposing a new tool for managing patient medical file traceability and improving <b>file</b> <b>sorting</b> in order to reduce delays during delivery and globally improve quality of care. This study is part of a project conducted with the Lucien Neuwirth Cancer Institute (Saint-Etienne, France). A formal modeling of medical file flows is proposed to identify risks related to lack of traceability. A discrete-event simulation model is also proposed to test various organization scenarios related to file management outside and inside the archive department of the cancer institute. New traceability software has been implemented to support the newly proposed organization...|$|R

We analyze the evolution of research on parallel sorting, from the earliest sorting networks to the shared memory algorithms and the VLSI sorters. In the context of sorting networks, we describe two fundamental parallel merging schemes - the odd-even and the bitonic merge. Sorting algorithms have been derived from these merging algorithms for parallel computers where processors communicate through interconnection networks such as the perfect shuffle, the mesh {{and a number of other}} sparse networks. After describing the network sorting algorithms, we show that, with a shared memory model of parallel computation, faster algorithms have been derived from parallel enumeration sorting schemes, where keys are first ranked and then rearranged according to their rank...|$|R
