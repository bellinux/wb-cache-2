50|$|As {{part of his}} Master’s thesis, Serrière {{did some}} {{research}} on autism, studying three specific cases and the insertion of these three individuals with {{the general population of}} people with developmental disabilities. He worked with Dr. Bernard Rimland, Director of the Autism Research Institute. Serrière is convinced that the diagnosis of autism should not have been altered to include the word “spectrum” to its name “autism spectrum” as it now became a catch-all for all troubled children including misbehaving and attention deficit. To respond to numerous friends and parents who approached him looking for a three-minute diagnosis of their sons or daughters, Serriere generalize by sharing his beliefs that there is no Autism or Asperger syndrome or <b>Kanner</b> <b>syndrome</b> without specific visible traits: the person afflicted with autism is in his/her own world without eye contact or paying attention to the other person. They resent being touched, even a handshake. They will often keep busy by tapping fingers on own face, a colorful toy, a window and seeming to pay deep attention to the rhythm and the sensation received from this patter. They might spin plates or doing excessive and very repetitive movement including jumping on a trampoline for hours. Of course, there are also the “Autistic Savants” or savantism who will excel in math, drawing, music, memory exercise such a retaining an entire piano concerto, the decimals of 3 over 14, the view of a details of a building, dates past and future, etc. Serrière still believes that Dr. Rimland’s long qualifying (500 questions) questionnaire should be the only basis for defining autism.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Autism {{spectrum}} disorders (ASD) comprise typical or {{infantile autism}} (<b>Kanner</b> <b>syndrome),</b> Asperger’s disorder and atypical autism or pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified. The syndrome {{is characterized by}} deficits in (1) verbal and nonverbal communication, (2) reciprocal social interaction and (3) repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests and activities. Early behavioural interventions are based on learning theory and behaviour therapy. They take into account specific deficits in perception, emotional reactions, social interaction and communication. In Germany, these comprehensive models are not widely evaluated and implemented. Research questions: * What are the clinical effectiveness and safety of early behavioural or skills-based early interventions in autism compared to other interventions or to treatment as usual? * What are specific factors responsible for the effectiveness? * What are the cost-effectiveness and cost consequences of different early interventions in autism? * Which legal, social and ethical aspects are relevant {{with regard to the}} implementation of the respective interventions in persons with autism? Methods: Following a systematic review of the literature, controlled studies on early behavioural or skills-based interventions published since 2000 in English or German with children until the age of twelve are included and critically appraised. Studies must have at least ten participants per intervention group. Results: In total, 15 publications based on 14 studies, eight systematic reviews and one health economic study are included. Most studies evaluate early interventions based upon the Lovaas model (Early intensive behavioural treatment (EIBT), Applied behavioural analysis (ABA)). Other evaluate pragmatic interventions or interventions based on other theoretical models like specific parent interventions, responsive education and prelinguistic milieu teaching, joint attention, symbolic play, and picture exchange communication system. Behaviour analytic interventions referring to the Lovaas model remain the most empirically evaluated early interventions in autism. Preschool children with autism can achieve improvements in cognitive and functional domains when treated within behavioural interventions with a frequency of at least 20 hours per week. It is not clear which is the minimum duration of effective interventions, and which active components are necessary for the effectiveness. There was no high quality evidence for other comprehensive early interventions. The identified health economic study is not suitable to evaluate the cost-effectiveness or cost consequences of early interventions. No publications concerning legal, ethical or social aspects were identified. The financial situation of persons with autisms and their families will be improved through the implementation of the “Pflege-Weiterententwicklungsgesetz” (Pf-WG). Further questions concern the organisation of care and the legal representation of autistic patients. Ethical questions arise mainly {{in the context of the}} equal supply of care to each individual patient in all regions of the country and the situation of the caregivers. Discussion: There are only a few studies with high methodology evaluating early interventions in children with autism. Most studies have a short duration with a lack of blinded outcome assessment in many cases. The lack of high quality comparative studies does not allow answering questions of comparative effectiveness of early interventions in autism. It can be concluded that interventions referring to the Lovaas model seem to have the highest effectiveness. This seems to be especially true when they are run clinic-based. However, there was no solid evidence with regard to factors responsible for the effectiveness of programms according to the ABA model. With regard to communication improvement, a systematic parent training seems to be superior to treatment as usual where a mixture of therapeutic elements is used. As well for clinical and health economic studies there is a substantial problem of generalisability into the German context. The identified health economic study is not suitable to evaluate the cost-effectiveness or cost consequences of early interventions. Conclusion: Based on the available studies, there is no sufficient evidence for any of the evaluated behavioural early intervention programmes. Studies suggest that preschool children with autism in behavioural intervention programmes with a frequency of at least 20 hours per week can achieve improvements in cognitive and functional domains. There is no evidence that in a substantial portion of the children a normal development can be achieved by early interventions. Most research evidence is available for ABA. A minimal necessary intensity of interventions to achieve positive outcomes cannot be derived from literature. There are no valid statements possible as to cost-effectiveness or consequences of these interventions. Effective early interventions may reduce total autism costs in the long run. This may be achieved when the initial high treatment expenditures are more than compensated later if persons with this disorder have better social functioning...|$|E
40|$|Urines from 19 autistic {{children}} (3 female, 16 male) {{were analyzed by}} high-resolution, high-pressure anion-exchange chromatography. The results showed abnormalities in the excretion of hippuric acid, 4 -hydroxyhippuric acid, and N 1 -methyl- 2 -pyridone- 5 -carboxamide, the end product of the nicotinic acid pathway. Considerations as to the met-abolic origin of the 4 -hydroxyhippuric acid are discussed and related {{to the possibility of}} bacterial action and mal-absorption.

40|$|ABSTRACT A key {{component}} of human intelligence is our ability to think about each other’s mental states. This ability provides an interesting challenge for cognitive neuroscience attempts {{to understand the nature}} of abstract concepts and how the brain acquires them. Research over the past 15 years has shown that very young children and children of extremely limited intellectual ability can acquire mental state concepts with ease. Children with <b>Kanner’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> have severe difficulty using these concepts, despite relatively great experience and ability. These discoveries have led to the development of the first information processing models of belief-desire reasoning. The term “theory of mind ” was coined by David Premack (Premack and Woodruff, 1978) to refer to our ability to explain, predict, and interpret behavior in terms of mental states, like wanting, believing, an...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} {{infantile}} autism using computed tomographic scanning {{emphasized the importance}} of studying cases of classic autism (<b>Kanner's</b> <b>syndrome)</b> without complicating conditions such as mental retardation. Computed tomographic scan studies of such patients reported no evidence of anatomical abnormalities of cerebral hemi-spheres or of subcortical structures, which are defined by landmarks such as the lateral ventricles and lentiform nuclei. Examination of the cerebellum was not mentioned. The most recent postmortem neuropathologic study reported significant cerebellar abnormality, but the study was of a severely retarded autistic individual. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we have found in vivo evidence of a significant and unusual cerebellar malformation in a person with the classic form of autism uncomplicated by mental retardation (current nonverbal IQ = 112), epilepsy, history of drug use, postnatal trauma, or disease. The finding showed hypoplasia of the declive, folium, and tuber in posterior vermis, but not of the anterior vermis, and hypoplasia of only the medial aspect of each cerebellar hemisphere. The right posterior cerebral hemisphere also showed pathologic findings. © 1987, American Medical Association. All rights reserved...|$|R
2500|$|As {{early as}} 1899, the term [...] "child psychiatry" [...] (in French) {{was used as}} a {{subtitle}} in Manheimer's monograph Les Troubles Mentaux de l'Enfance. However, the Swiss psychiatrist Moritz Tramer (1882–1963) was probably the first to define the parameters of child psychiatry in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis within the discipline of medicine, in 1933. In 1934, Tramer founded the Zeitschrift für Kinderpsychiatrie (Journal of Child Psychiatry), which later became Acta Paedopsychiatria. The first academic child psychiatry department in the world was founded in 1930 by Leo Kanner (18941981), an Austrian émigré and medical graduate of the University of Berlin, under the direction of Adolf Meyer at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore. Kanner was the first physician to be identified as a child psychiatrist in the US and his textbook, Child Psychiatry (1935), is credited with introducing both the specialty and the term to the Anglo-phone academic community. [...] In 1936, Kanner established the first formal elective course in child psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. In 1944 he provided the first clinical description of early infantile autism, otherwise known as <b>Kanner's</b> <b>Syndrome.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since Kanner's {{demarcation}} {{of childhood}} autism, research on autism {{continues to be}} an area of increasing interest. Although much progress has been made, this field is still in its infancy, and many avenues of research are just beginning to be pursued. Despite the time that has passed, the <b>syndrome</b> <b>Kanner</b> identified and his comments about the children he observed continue to have meaning today, and although some of his suggestions about the etiology and presentation of autism were grounded in the thinking of his day, many of his observations were quite prescient.|$|R
40|$|Although autism {{may have}} beenobserved in ancient Mesopo-tamia (Gillberg & Coleman, 2000), autistic syndromes were first re-ported {{medically}} only 60 years ago (As-perger, 1944; <b>Kanner,</b> 1943). Autistic <b>syndromes</b> {{are characterized by}} a combi-nation of impaired social, communica-tive, and imaginative skills. Furthermore, restricted and repetitive patterns of be-havior {{with a variety of}} routines and rit-uals are common (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). A strong genetic in-fluence has been detected in the dis-orders (e. g., Bailey et al., 1995), and various biological as well as cognitive ab-normalities have been reported (e. g., Gillberg & Coleman, 2000). Urinary peptide abnormalities, con-sisting of abnormal patterns and elevated levels of peptides, are biological abnor-malities that were first reported in indi-viduals with autism 20 years ago (K. L. Reichelt et al., 1981), and the original findings have been replicated repeatedl...|$|R
