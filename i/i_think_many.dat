500|$|Dworkin {{rejected}} that interpretation of her argument, stating {{in a later}} interview that [...] "I think both intercourse and sexual pleasure can and will survive equality" [...] and suggesting that the misunderstanding came about because of the very sexual ideology she was criticizing: [...] "Since the paradigm for sex {{has been one of}} conquest, possession, and violation, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>many</b> men believe they need an unfair advantage, which at its extreme would be called rape. I do not think they need it." ...|$|E
500|$|Loretta {{has stated}} {{on-screen}} {{that she does}} not want to conform with the stereotype of a blond pole dancer, and makes it clear that she is a keen bird watcher and enjoys documentaries. Speaking of the character Walton stated, [...] "I love that Loretta's not a stereotypical stripper sort of girl—there’s a lot more depth to her. She’s actually quite shy and reserved. She’s got lots of interesting little hobbies, like bird-watching and Roman history! Then at night she skips off and turns into a stripper. It’s like two different lives, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>many</b> real-life pole-dancers are like that. They’re really nice, normal girls by day, and by night they turn into these temptresses." [...] Walton also praised the soap's realistic portrayal of the occupation, saying that many pole dancers attend university or have good professions but rely on stripping for extra money, and that she has met people like her character in the strip club where Hollyoaks films scenes.|$|E

500|$|Yuri on Ice has {{highlighted}} homophobia {{in figure}} skating and other areas; the seventh episode features a flashback {{in which a}} younger Victor performs in a costume based on those worn by openly-gay figure skater Johnny Weir, who was subject to homophobic comments throughout his career. Weir {{said in an interview}} with The Geekiary, [...] "I think all positive imagery of LGBT themes in sport are good. Unfortunately, the majority of people that rule the skating world are conservative and more business minded. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>many</b> of them, while they may love and appreciate the art and the sport, are more interested in the business side of things or power trips. I don't know if Yuri on Ice will be able to change the perception of gay athletes to a 60 year old businessman, but I am of the school of thought that every little bit helps". The series finale features a scene in which Yuri K. and Victor skate together at an exhibition event; something which has not yet occurred in actual competition. Critics have noted that the series depicts two characters from countries with problems concerning LGBT rights.|$|E

2500|$|On December 29, 2013 DiFranco {{issued an}} apology, announcing {{that she was}} {{cancelling}} the retreat, stating that [...] "i am not unaware of the mechanism of white privilege {{or the fact that}} i need to listen more than talk when it comes to issues of race. if nottoway is simply not an acceptable place for me to go and try to do my work in the eyes of many, then let me just concede before more divisive words are spilled. ... <b>i</b> <b>think</b> <b>many</b> positive and life-affirming connections would have been made at this conference, in its all of its complexity of design. [...] {{i do not wish to}} reinvent the righteous retreat at this point to eliminate the stay at the Nottoway Plantation. at this point I wish only to cancel." [...] The singer's statements were called [...] "remarkably unapologetic" [...] on Jezebel, and [...] "a variety of excuses and justifications" [...] by Ebony,. Additionally, a piece at The Guardian said the announcement made [...] "much of the idea that this was all a mistake, with no indication of remorse." ...|$|E

Perhaps they have reason to thank God {{that they do not}} understand or feel it; yet, the day may come--a day of sadness, fear, perplexity, sorrow, when they will understand it, and thank God that their forefathers placed it in the prayer-book, for them to fall back upon, as comfort and hope in the day of trouble; putting words into their mouths and thoughts into their hearts, which they, perhaps, never would have found out for themselves.|$|E
5000|$|Of the quartet, Cellista {{has said}} [...] "The {{narrative}} of the quartet seemed to have immediacy to the San Jose of now. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> in <b>many</b> ways it makes apparent San Jose's connection {{to the past and}} illuminates a way to the future." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{sometimes}} fancy {{that every}} great city {{must have been}} built by night. At least, it is only at night that every part of a great city is great. All architecture is great architecture after sunset; perhaps architecture is really a nocturnal art, like the art of fireworks. At least, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>many</b> people of those nobler trades that work by night (journalists, policemen, burglars, coffee-stall keepers, and such mistaken enthusiasts as refuse to go home till morning) must often have stood admiring some black bulk of building with a crown of battlements or a crest of spires and then burst into tears at daybreak to discover {{that it was only}} a haberdasher's shop with huge gold letters across the face of it.|$|E

These overseers are, many of them, sons of Turkish mothers, and have no sympathy, save that caused by interest, with one parent more than another. Of course, they are brought up Christians, and taught to hold Moslems in abhorrence, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>many</b> of them, if they had their free choice, would cross to the mainland. Here they have no chance of ever being aught but what they are--overseers of slaves, or small prison officials. They are despised by these haughty knights, and hated by us, while were they to reach the mainland and adopt their mothers' religion, everything {{would be open to}} them. All followers of the Prophet have an equal chance, and one may be a soldier today, a bey tomorrow, and a pasha a year hence, if he be brave, or astute, or capable in any way beyond his fellows. Men like these warders would be sure to make their way.|$|E

60|$|As for Confusion in the Church, I {{look upon}} {{this to be}} the {{greatest}} Objection that can be raised; but then it must be allow'd, that without Writing the Reformation (the Glory of our Religion) could never have been effected; and in respect to religious Controversies, tho' I own they are seldom attended with good Consequences, yet I must beg leave to observe, that as the Age we now live in, is more bright and shining in substantial Literature than any preceding Century, so the generality of Mankind are capable of judging with such an Exactness as to avoid a Bad; not but, I confess, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>many</b> of the Persons concern'd in the Controversy lately on foot, with relation to the Bishop of Bangor's Sermon, preach'd before His Majesty, deserve to be stigmatiz'd, as well for their indecent Heat, as for the Latitude taken with regard to the Holy Scriptures.

60|$|It is now suggested--publicly in some quarters, privately in many quarters--that the House of Lords {{will not}} only use without scruple their veto in {{legislation}} but they propose to extend their prerogatives; {{they are going to}} lay their hands upon finance, and if they choose they will reject or amend the Budget. I have always thought it a great pity that Mr. Gladstone made a compromise with the House of Lords over the Franchise Bill of 1884. I regret, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>many</b> of my hon. friends in the House of Commons will regret, looking back upon the past, that the present Government did not advise a dissolution of Parliament upon the rejection of the Education Bill in 1906. A dissolution in those circumstances would not merely have involved the measure under discussion, but if the Government of that day had received the support of the electors at the poll their victory must have carried with it that settlement and reform of the relations between the two Houses of Parliament which is necessary to secure the effective authority of the House of Commons. That is the question which, behind and beyond all others, even the Budget, even Free Trade, even the land--that is the question which, as the Prime Minister has said, is the dominant issue of our time.|$|E
