25|$|In 1976, Boreman married Larry Marchiano, a cable {{installer}} {{who later}} owned a <b>dry</b> <b>wall</b> business. They had two children, Dominic (born 1977) and Lindsay (born 1980). They lived in Center Moriches, {{a small town}} on Long Island. Boreman was then going through the liver transplant that her injuries from the automobile accident had necessitated, owing to the poorly screened blood she received in the tranfusions. For a while, marriage and particularly motherhood brought her some stability and happiness. But in 1990, Larry's business went bankrupt and {{the family moved to}} Colorado.|$|E
2500|$|These {{early years}} in Anscombe's {{practice}} were also {{early years in}} the history of the New Zealand Institute of Architects (N.Z.I.A), which began as a national organisation in 1905. Anscombe was elected a Fellow of the N.Z.I.A. in 1912. He also contributed an article entitled: [...] "The Economic Value of Scientific Town Planning" [...] to an N.Z.I.A. conference. About 1916, Anscombe began experimenting with a concrete block <b>dry</b> <b>wall</b> system. It was at this time he designed [...] "Cintra," [...] his house in Andersons Bay, Dunedin, which was constructed in these [...] "O.K. blocks" [...] which he patented in 1920. Shortly after this Anscombe's mother died at the age of 66 years on 2 July 1921.|$|E

His picture went no deeper than the plaster.' ...|$|E

50|$|The {{walls were}} built then as <b>dry</b> <b>walls</b> and were {{restored}} in 1995 because the road has still {{to work as}} a replacement for the tunnel if it has to be closed. The restoration was completed with a minimum amount of concrete reinforcements.|$|R
50|$|In most American West Coast cities, {{the need}} for {{resisting}} earthquakes at a low building cost results {{in the construction of}} many low-rise apartments of wooden frames with thin plaster-board based exterior and interior <b>dry</b> <b>walls,</b> despite sometimes being on as many as three or four levels.|$|R
60|$|The shadeless downs {{were now}} brown with the {{droughts}} of the passing summer, and few living things met his view, the natural rotundity of the elevation being only occasionally {{disturbed by the}} presence of a barrow, a thorn-bush, or a piece of <b>dry</b> <b>wall</b> which remained from some attempted enclosure. By the time that he reached the village it was dark, and the larger stars had begun to shine when he walked up {{to the door of the}} old- fashioned house which was the family residence of this branch of the South-Wessex Hardys.|$|E
60|$|Knight pondered on {{the meaning}} of Elfride's hasty disappearance, but could not avoid an instinctive {{conclusion}} that there existed but a doubtful hope for him. As far as he could judge, his sole chance of deliverance lay in the possibility of a rope or pole being brought; and this possibility was remote indeed. The soil upon these high downs was left so untended that they were unenclosed for miles, except by a casual bank or <b>dry</b> <b>wall,</b> and were rarely visited but for the purpose of collecting or counting the flock which found a scanty means of subsistence thereon.|$|E
6000|$|Above {{these three}} [...] "Tombs of the Kings" [...] are many rock-cavities {{which may or}} may not have been sepulchral. Time has done his worst with them. We mounted the {{background}} of a quoin-shaped hill by a well-trodden path, leading to the remnants of a rude Burj ("watch-tower"), and to a semicircle of <b>dry</b> <b>wall,</b> garnished with a few sticks for hanging rags and tatters. The latter denotes the Musallat Shu'ayb, or praying-place of (prophet) Jethro; and here our Sayyid and our Shaykh took the opportunity of applying for temporal and eternal blessings. The height at the edge of the precipice which, cliffing to the north, showed a view of our camp and of Yubú and Shu'shú' Islands, was in round numbers 450 feet (aner. 29.40--28.94). From this vantage-ground we could distinctly trace the line of the Wady Makná, beginning in a round basin at the western foot of the northern Shigd Mountain and its sub-range; while low rolling hills, along which we were to travel, separated it from the Wady Bada'-Afál to the south.|$|E
