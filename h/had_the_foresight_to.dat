25|$|From the {{official}} after-action reports for the Battle of Wilson's Creek (Oak Hills), the Pulaski Light Artillery performed like veterans, coolly and professionally. In fact, {{at least one}} regimental commander remarked that Woodruff's battery was key to the Southern victory. Captain Woodruff had <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>foresight</b> <b>to</b> have his battery limbered up, with horses standing in trace, at dawn on August 10. Thus, when the Union batteries opened on the Southern forces, the Pulaski Light Artillery was the first Confederate battery {{to be able to}} move into position, unlimber and open fire. Initially firing counter-battery salvoes to silence the Union guns, Woodruff's battery was then moved to a position to support an assault by Arkansas and Louisiana infantry on the Federal lines.|$|E

25|$|Other Sri Lankan rulers whose {{military}} achievements {{stand out}} include King Gajabâhu (113 AD), who sailed to India {{to bring back}} his captured soldiers, and King Dhatusena (433) who is credited with repulsing numerous Indian invasions and for organising a naval build-up to deter seaborne attacks. He also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>foresight</b> <b>to</b> cover his defences with artillery. Vijayabâhu I (1001) was another warrior king who dislodged Indian invaders and united the country. Parakramabahu the Great (1153) was an outstanding monarch of the Polonnaruwa period of Sri Lankan history, and his accomplishments as a military leader and a great administrator are noteworthy. His reign included a military expedition to Burma (Myanmar) in retaliation for indignities inflicted on his envoys and Burmese interference in the elephant trade. This marked the first overseas expedition in Sri Lankan military history. It is also reported that Parakramabahu's fame was such that his assistance was sought by South Indian rulers {{who were involved in}} internecine struggles. Another strong ruler in the pre-colonial era was Parâkramabâhu VI, who defeated Indian invaders, united the island and ruled it from capital Sri Jayawardhanapura, Kotte.|$|E

This was later changed to [...] "Hartford City" [...] after it was discovered that another [...] "Hartford" [...] already existed elsewhere in Indiana. [...] The East Central Indiana version of Hartford was named county seat of Blackford County early in its existence, thereby ensuring its importance. [...] It took over 40 years for the rural community to grow to a population of nearly 1,500. [...] During that time, community planners <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>foresight</b> <b>to</b> plan for railroads, which linked the community to other cities, beginning in the 1860s.

[...] The delegates proposed a provisional government to consist of a legislative council of ten members (one from each Kentucky congressional district); a governor, who had the power to appoint judicial and other officials; a treasurer; and an auditor. [...] The delegates designated Bowling Green (then under the control of Confederate general Albert Sidney Johnston) as the Confederate State capital, but <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>foresight</b> <b>to</b> provide for the government to meet anywhere deemed appropriate by the council and governor.

However, the inactivation of the HH-1 CSAR units in September 1987 closed a valuable pipeline of CSAR-trained aircrew members and limited the combat rescue role {{to a total of}} four overseas HH-3E Jolly Green Giant units and a stateside MH-60G special operations-capable Pave Hawk squadron. Furthermore, developments in the mid-1980s called into questions whether the MH-60G would continue to be affiliated with ARRS or with Military Airlift Command's newly formed 23rd Air Force for special operations following the divestiture of all USAF special operations forces from Tactical Air Command (TAC).|$|R
500|$|No.3 Squadron was re-formed at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, on 1July 1925, with Lukis as its Commanding Officer (CO). Over {{the next}} week, {{operating}} DH.9s and S.E.5s, the unit established {{itself at the}} Air Force's newest base, RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales. Alerted to a forthcoming inspection by the Chief of the Air Staff, Group Captain Richard Williams, Lukis <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>foresight</b> <b>to</b> engage in a speedy beautification program at the base, arranging delivery of pot plants and shrubs; the notoriously fastidious Williams concluded the inspection by pronouncing himself [...] "happily surprised... that so much had been done so quickly". For the duration of his tour as No.3 Squadron commander, Lukis doubled as CO of the base. He was promoted squadron leader on 2July 1927, and handed over command to Squadron Leader Harry Cobby on 13January 1930. Lukis served as CO of No.1 Squadron from 1930 to 1934, interrupted in 1931 by a posting to Britain to [...] attend RAF Staff College, Andover. Raised to wing commander, he was placed in charge of No.1 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, in 1936. He held command of No.1 Flying Training School at Point Cook from January 1938 to November 1939, receiving appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1938 King's Birthday Honours, and promotion to group captain in July the same year.|$|E

The building material required was not close by as sandstone quarries were at quite a distance. Since the Maharaja <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>foresight</b> <b>to</b> bring his project to fruition, he built a railway line to the quarry site to transport the building material. Donkeys were inducted to haul soil to the site.

2500|$|Some of the game's {{criticism}} {{stemmed from}} the limitations of what procedural generation can bring to a game. While the engine can produce {{a vast array of}} different planets, it is built atop a finite number of predetermined assets, such as basic creature shapes or planetary biomes, and one quickly exhausts these core assets even with the variations allowed by procedural generation. An evaluation of the game's code showed that Hello Games <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>foresight</b> <b>to</b> enable new predetermined assets to be added into the game through updates, which Gamasutra Alissa McAloon suggested that with more artists to provide more content, Hello Games or third-parties could exponentially expand the perceived uniqueness of each planet. Kate Compton, who worked on the procedural generation elements of Spore, called this issue [...] "procedural oatmeal", in that while you can pour a near infinite number of bowls of oatmeal with various differences, the end result still will look like a bowl of oatmeal. Compton noted that No Man's Sky lacks a quality of perceptual uniqueness, a problem that other game researchers are looking to try to solve to provide a more crafted but still procedurally generated experience to the player, placing less emphasis on the vastness of potential outcomes as No Man's Skys marketing relied on.|$|E

40|$|Process {{reengineering}} {{as defined}} by Hammer and Champy in their book, Reengi-neering the Corporation, 1 is “the fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in critical, contemporary measures of performance, such as cost, quality, service, and speed. ” It is being applied at an increasing rate by three kinds of companies: those in deep trouble, those not yet in trouble but whose management <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>foresight</b> <b>to</b> see trouble coming, and those in peak condition with no discernible difficulties whose manage-ment is ambitious and aggressive.

40|$|A {{factor that}} unquestionably amplified the {{magnitude}} of the financial crisis was widespread miscalculation by banks and investors. It raises the question why most directors in the bank did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>foresight</b> <b>to</b> predict <b>the</b> problems of taking on too much risk. This article argues that one reason for these failures may be the under-representation of varied educational backgrounds and differentiated viewpoints in boards. Psychological economics shows that experts and males <b>have</b> <b>the</b> tendency to underestimate the probability of non-typical or negative events. Literature further demonstrates that especially homogeneous groups often engage in herding behavior and thus cause systematic risks. Using a dataset which has been collected shortly before the financial system was in danger of collapsing we demonstrate that females and persons with a non-economic-background were significantly more able to predict the collapsing stock market prices whereas males with an economic background made by fare the worst predictions. A second data sample supports these findings for decision making in a strategic context. The results show that banks which relied on decision committees with a higher percentage of non-economists are less affected by the financial crisis...|$|R
