5|$|Lobengula {{refused to}} allow any of the izinDuna to sign the document. Exactly why he did this is not clear.

Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might have felt that it would be harder to repudiate the document later if it bore the marks of his izinDuna alongside his own.|$|E
5|$|On the {{question}} of Malcolm's putative pilgrimage, pilgrimages to Rome, or other long-distance journeys, were far from unusual. Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Cnut and Mac Bethad <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> mentioned. Rognvald Kali Kolsson {{is known to have}} gone crusading in the Mediterranean in the 12th century. Nearer in time, Dyfnwal of Strathclyde died on pilgrimage to Rome in 975 as did Máel Ruanaid uá Máele Doraid, King of the Cenél Conaill, in 1025.|$|E

The Grimms, with the help of Cavaldi and Angelika (Lena Headey), a knowing huntress from the village, intend to destroy the Mirror Queen.|$|E

5|$|Sélestat {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 727 AD but the town probably has an earlier Celtic or Roman origin. Archaeological findings {{provide evidence of}} human settlement during the Mesolithic, the Neolithic and the Bronze Age. A large number of wood piles dating from the 1st and 2nd centuries AD were discovered around St. Quirin chapel, suggesting a Roman settlement. At that time Sélestat might <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> a port on the river Ill.|$|E
5|$|The West Kootenay, however, is {{transitioning}} from a coal-mining to a tourism-based economy, and {{the rest}} of the Kootenay region is also starting to do so.

5|$|Although such megastructures may be {{theoretically}} possible, all {{plans to}} build a fixed-in-place Dyson sphere are currently far beyond humanity's engineering capacity. However, parts of the technology, like orbiting satellites and solar sails, <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> developed. Deployment of spacecraft and satellites using photovoltaics might be seen as the first small steps towards building a Dyson swarm. However, the number of craft required to obtain, transmit, and maintain a complete Dyson sphere far exceeds present-day industrial capabilities. George Dvorsky has advocated use of self-replicating robots to overcome this limitation in the relatively near term. Some have suggested that such habitats could be built around white dwarfs and even pulsars.|$|E

A number of grants have been made to people who <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> recognized with state honours for their notable achievements, such as through admission to the Order of Canada, and who are accordingly entitled to a grant of arms. Those who are Companions of the order may also request the chief herald to grant them supporters.|$|E
5|$|In a 2007 report, ConnDOT {{outlined}} {{plans to}} turn SLE into a full-service bidirectional regional rail line, with full-day service and all trains extended to New London. This involves incremental improvements, {{similar to those}} that <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> put into place. One of the first priorities is to add a second platform at all stations, which is mandated by the 2003 agreement with Amtrak. New London, Old Saybrook, Guilford, Westbrook, Branford, and stops from New Haven Union Station west all have multiple platforms, while State Street has an island platform serving two tracks with plans for a second platform.|$|E
5|$|Later, fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tells Black {{that he has}} {{uncovered}} computer files from the Group, indicating that a virus discovered by bio-weapons scientists in the Soviet Union has been living dormant in bird species {{since the end of}} the Cold War, and may now be making a resurgence in the United States. Watts reveals that a vaccine has been developed by the Group, but only in sufficient quantities for its members; Watts and Black <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> inoculated without having realized at the time. Black tells Watts to locate Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), another Group member, as he hopes to keep them safe in the cabin until the crisis resolves.|$|E

5|$|Oral history {{offers several}} stories {{regarding}} {{the origins of}} the Sihanaka. Betsimisaraka traders may have been the first to reach the area traveling inland on the Maningory River. Another view posits that the presence of ancient earthen defensive trenches suggests the ancestors of the Merina may have passed by Lake Alaotra on their migration from the southeastern coast to the central highlands, leaving behind settlers whose descendants formed the first Sihanaka communities. Alternatively, a large group calling itself Sihanaka may have migrated from Imerina into the Alaotra area, which may <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> settled by individuals of various other ethnic groups, in order to maintain independence from the rule of the Merina king.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the past}} 2 billion years, star {{formation}} throughout Andromeda's disk {{is thought to}} have decreased to the point of near-inactivity. There have been interactions with satellite galaxies like M32, M110, or others that <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> absorbed by Andromeda Galaxy. These interactions have formed structures like Andromeda's Giant Stellar Stream. A galactic merger roughly 100 million years ago is believed to be responsible for a counter-rotating disk of gas found in the center of Andromeda as well as the presence there of a relatively young (100 million years old) stellar population.|$|E
5|$|Pholiota squarrosa {{is thought}} to be a white rot fungus, which use {{cellulose}} as a carbon source, and have the ability to degrade the lignin (present in wood) to carbon dioxide to access the cellulose molecule. The fungus can attack a wide variety of deciduous host trees, including sugar maple, red maple, yellow birch, paper birch, American beech, and white ash. It can also attack conifers, like spruce. The fungus is a secondary parasite, in that it attacks trees that <b>have</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> weakened from prior injury or infection by bacteria or other fungi. It also functions as a saprobe, and can obtain nutrients by breaking down organic matter in dead wood.|$|E
