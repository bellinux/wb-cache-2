Elsewhere, Leland Palmer (Ray Wise), still {{mourning}} Laura's death, dances {{in his living}} room, sobbing and holding a portrait of Laura as he does so. He breaks open the picture's frame, cutting <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>as</b> his wife Sarah (Grace Zabriskie) screams at him to stop.|$|E
5|$|Feit {{initially}} denied hearing Garza's confession in the rectory, but {{he later}} {{admitted to having}} done so. He accounted for his absence from the sanctuary by explaining that he had broken his glasses that night; {{he said that he}} often played with his glasses nervously as he listened to confession. Feit said that he had driven back to the pastoral house to get another pair of glasses, and when he arrived he had no key, so he had to climb into the house on the second floor. He said that he sustained the scratches on <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>as</b> was climbing the outside of the brick structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} three sons born in Adelaide,Unley to Martin and Jeanne (née Richardson), Chappell was steeped in the game from an early age. His father was a noted Adelaide grade cricketer who put a bat in <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>as</b> {{soon as he could}} walk, and his {{maternal}} grandfather was famous all-round sportsman Vic Richardson, who captained Australia {{at the end of a}} nineteen-Test career. Chappell was given weekly batting lessons from the age of five, as were younger brothers Greg and Trevor, who both also went on to play for Australia.|$|E

5|$|While {{the plane}} {{suffered}} relatively little damage, the suspect incurred {{first and second}} degree burns to <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>as</b> well as second-degree burns to his right inner thigh and genitalia. Two other passengers were also injured. When the plane landed, Abdulmutallab was handed over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers, and taken into custody for questioning and treatment of his injuries in a secured room of the burn unit of the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor. Schuringa was also taken to the hospital. One other passenger incurred minor injuries.|$|E
25|$|After {{doing his}} normal pre-jump show {{and a few}} warm up approaches, Knievel began his real approach. When he hit the takeoff ramp, he felt the {{motorcycle}} unexpectedly decelerate. The sudden loss of power on the takeoff caused Knievel to come up short and land on the safety ramp which {{was supported by a}} van. This caused the handlebars to be ripped out of <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>as</b> he tumbled over them onto the pavement where he skidded into the Dunes parking lot.|$|E
25|$|After Jesus' {{return from}} Herod's court, Pilate {{publicly}} declares that he finds Jesus {{to be innocent}} of the charges, but the crowd insists on capital punishment. The universal rule of the Roman Empire limited capital punishment strictly to the tribunal of the Roman governor and Pilate decided to publicly wash <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>as</b> not being privy to Jesus' death. Pilate thus presents himself as an advocate pleading Jesus' case {{rather than as a}} judge in an official hearing, yet he orders the crucifixion of Jesus.|$|E

25|$|On {{the upper}} surface {{we have the}} statue of a {{kneeling}} monk, a depiction of the Virgin Mary, and John the Evangelist. Below the scenes on this face of the calvary comprise blocks of granite carved in high-relief. The first positioned on the left, depicts Pontius Pilate washing <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>as</b> Jesus, held by two soldiers, is brought before him. Next we see the two thieves and Jesus, all three carrying their crosses. On the frieze below we see the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple with Jesus standing on a small stool and two depictions dealing with baptism. The first shows the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist and the second Jesus baptizing the faithful as recounted in John 3, Verse 26. Finally Jesus is shown holding discussions with the elders in the temple.|$|E
25|$|Born in Unley, South Australia, Chappell was {{the second}} of three sons born in Adelaide to Arthur Martin and Jeanne Ellen (née Richardson), a Cornish Australian family. He was steeped in the game from a very early age: his father Martin was a noted grade cricketer in Adelaide who put a bat in <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>as</b> {{soon as he could}} walk, while his {{maternal}} grandfather was the famous all-round sportsman Vic Richardson, who had captained Australia in Test cricket. Elder brother Ian and younger brother Trevor also played for Australia, and Greg closely followed in Ian's footsteps to the top. Given weekly lessons by coach Lynn Fuller, the brothers fought out fierce backyard cricket matches, with no holds barred. The fraternal relationship between Ian and Greg became legendary in Australian cricketing history for volatile verbal slanging matches, even during hard fought Test matches, which had their genesis in the family backyard.|$|E
25|$|Considerable {{confusion}} and disputes {{seem to have}} followed Darras's unusual and untimely death. At Sidbury the advowson was contested. On 6 July, as a new rector was needed at Sidbury, Henry St George acted as patron, presenting William Walkebache. On 11 August, however, John Talbot, 6th Baron Furnivall, also acting as patron and described as lord of Sidbury, presented Walter Lawrence. Talbot, the young son of Richard, Lord Talbot, and Ankaret le Strange, was to emerge as Arundel's main political rival in the county, prepared to fight force with force. On 23 August Bishop Robert Mascall was issued with a writ probiting him from admitting anyone to Sidbury until the issue was decided. The following April the bishop himself presented William Whitehead. By August 1409 Whitehead had resigned and Talbot presented his nominee for a second time, apparently triumphant {{in the struggle to}} take over Darras's lands and rights. The same pattern is shown at Linley, which probably fell into <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>as</b> his widow, Margaret Beauchamp, Countess of Shrewsbury, held half the manor as a jointure property after his death.|$|E

500|$|Bengough's {{cartoons}} {{are best}} remembered for fixing his renditions of Macdonald {{in the public}} imagination. [...] Bengough's bulbous-nosed politician often appeared baggy-eyed with bottles of alcohol in <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>as</b> a sombre symbol of corruption, {{in contrast to the}} work of John Henry Walker, another prolific caricaturist of Macdonald who depicted the prime minister's drunkenness to make light of him. [...] Bengough continued to hone his draftsmanship after Macdonald's death, but the wit and inspiration of his Macdonald cartoons continue to draw the most attention.|$|E
500|$|His body arches, forcing {{his torso}} to raise against the cross. Blood pours from the wounds in <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>as</b> his head {{falls to the}} side from fatigue and the {{physical}} reality of approaching death. His body is naked except for a sheer and transparent loincloth that only just covers his thighs and buttocks. The choice of a white, veil-like loincloth, dramatically more modest than the red garment in the Arezzo work, {{may be influenced by}} earlier crucifixions by Giunta Pisano. His nakedness highlights his vulnerability and suffering. It seems influenced by a thirteenth-century Franciscan Meditation on Christ that emphasised pathos and human interest in the suffering of the Passion; [...] "Turn your eyes away from His divinity for a little while and consider Him purely as a man".|$|E

500|$|Edward's {{motivation}} {{stems from}} a love for his brother, Alphonse, whom he is desperately seeking to restore to human form after their mistake. He is extremely idealistic, and strongly believes in the alchemical concept of [...] "Equivalent Exchange," [...] which states that every outcome requires an equal payment. Edward also behaves in a childish manner when confronted about his short height, tending to overreact to any negative comment regarding the subject, usually attacking people {{in a fit of}} rage. Unlike regular alchemists who use transmutation circles, Edward has the ability to create alchemical currents in his body simply by connecting <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>as</b> a result of his failed human transmutation which gave him such trait. In addition to this, Edward is a formidable fighter {{as a result of his}} training with Izumi, who had extensively trained both brothers in martial arts.|$|E
500|$|Brundage {{connected}} {{the world of}} art and that of amateur sports in his own mind. In {{a speech to the}} IOC session in Tokyo in 1958, he discussed netsuke, used at one time by Japanese to anchor items hung from kimono sashes, and of which he owned several thousand; he held two in <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>as</b> he spoke. He told the members that a netsuke was at one time carefully carved by the man who wore it, building [...] "something of himself into the design", and although a class of professional netsuke makers arose later, whose work might have been more technically adept, it was, [...] "ordinarily cold, stiff, and without imagination.... Missing was the element of the amateur carver, which causes these netsuke to be esteemed so much higher by the collector than the commercial product carved for money." [...] Brundage later commented about his speech, [...] "Here was the difference between amateurism and professionalism spelled out in a netsuke." ...|$|E
500|$|Before dawn on January 30, {{the coup}} forces caught the junta {{completely}} off-guard and seized power without a fight. Khánh grudgingly {{decided to keep}} Minh as a figurehead chief of state while maintaining real power in <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>as</b> Minh was popular within {{the army and the}} Americans wanted a show of unity to be maintained. Khánh also tried to consolidate his standing in the military by promoting a group of younger officers, and increasing the pay of the enlisted men. In the meantime, the other key generals in the junta, Don, Kim, Dinh and Xuan were put under house arrest, accused by Khánh of attempting to negotiate a peace deal with North Vietnam. However, when they were brought to a military trial presided over by Khánh, the junta leader did not provide any evidence and convicted them of [...] "lax morality". Khánh then allowed them back to meaningless desk jobs, but the show trial brought him much embarrassment. Khánh later admitted that there was no basis to the charges of neutralism against the four generals, and after a tumultuous year in power, Khánh was himself deposed in February 1965 and forced into exile.|$|E

500|$|Cecil Ralph [...] "Tiny" [...] Thompson (May 31, 1903– February 9, 1981) was a Canadian {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} goaltender. He played 12 {{seasons in the}} National Hockey League (NHL), first for the Boston Bruins, and later for the Detroit Red Wings. A four-time Vezina Trophy winner, Thompson {{was inducted into the}} Hockey Hall of Fame in 1959. He was a member of one Stanley Cup-winning team, as a rookie in the 1928–29 season with the Boston Bruins. At the start of the 1938–39 season, after ten full seasons with Boston, he was traded to the Detroit Red Wings, where he completed the season, and played another full one before retiring. During his NHL career, he recorded 81shutouts, the sixth highest of any goaltender. After retiring from playing, he coached lower-league teams before becoming a noted professional scout. Thompson helped popularize the technique of the [...] "glove save" [...] which was catching the puck with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>as</b> a method of making a save. A competent puckhandler, he was the first goaltender in the NHL to record an assist by passing the puck with his stick to a fellow player.|$|E
500|$|Monk {{carries out}} futile and endless {{attempts}} {{to make the world}} [...] "balanced". Monk is fixated with symmetry, {{going so far as to}} always cut his pancakes into squares. He strongly prefers familiarity and rigorous structure in his activities. Monk only drinks Sierra Springs water throughout seasons 1–5 and a fictional brand (Summit Creek) throughout seasons 6–8, to the point that in the season 2 episode [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to Mexico", Monk goes without drinking for several days because he cannot find any Sierra Springs. Monk also has great difficulty in standard social situations, so much so that he must write down common small talk phrases on note cards in an attempt to successfully socialize. While his obsessive attention to minute detail cripples him socially, it makes him a gifted detective and profiler. He has a photographic memory, and can reconstruct entire crime scenes based on little more than scraps of detail that seem unimportant to his colleagues. His trademark method of examining a crime scene, which Sharona used to call his [...] "Zen Sherlock Holmes thing", is to wander seemingly aimlessly around a crime scene, occasionally holding up <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>as</b> though framing a shot for a photograph. Shalhoub explained in an interview that Monk does this because it [...] "isolates and cuts the crime scene into slices" [...] and causes Monk to look at parts of the crime scene instead of the whole.|$|E
