500|$|In 2000, Josh Rand {{contacted}} Corey Taylor after Taylor {{had returned}} from touring in Japan with his other band Slipknot about material {{he had been working}} on. Speaking about the experience, Taylor said, [...] "we just started writing stuff and it started to happen". The duo wrote 14songs and began working in a studio on some demos. Taylor added that it got to a point where he said to Rand, [...] "I think we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> a real band together, because this is just too serious!" [...] After further enlisting the help of Joel Ekman and previous Stone Sour members Shawn Economaki and Jim Root, the band began working on the album at Catamount Studios in Cedar Falls, Iowa.

On [...] "My Baby's Taking Me Home" [...] off Lil' Beethoven (2002), the song title is repeated 104 times, with no other words being used, other than a spoken interlude. Similarly, on the same album, [...] "Your Call Is Very Important To Us", uses a corporation style call-hold message: [...] "Your call is very important to us. [...] Please hold" [...] which is then sung with some additional words: [...] "At first she said your call is very important to us, then she said please, please hold." [...] The only other lyrics in the song are [...] "Red light", [...] "Green light", [...] "I'm Getting Mixed Signals" [...] and [...] "Sorry, I'm <b>Going</b> <b>To</b> <b>Have</b> <b>To</b> <b>Put</b> You Back On Hold". These elements are layered with a simple piano line to create a highly textured effect.|$|E
40|$|In late 2006, {{shortly before}} the end of his tenure as {{secretary}} of defense, Donald Rumsfeld made the following remark regarding the ongoing U. S. role in Iraq: “The biggest mistake would be not to pass things over to the Iraqis. It’s their country. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> govern it. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> provide security for it. And they’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do it sooner rather than later. ” This remark is striking for its ahistorical crassness and demonstrated a striking amount of chutzpah even by Secretary Rumsfeld’s standards.

5000|$|The {{continuing}} {{success of}} the allied forces (composed of mostly Shi'ite paramilitary groups, though they also contain a significant Sunni contingent), particularly in Sunni areas such as Tikrit, where ISIS has been losing a series of conventional battles, has prompted them to utilise more guerilla-like stratagems such as sending out coordinated teams of suicide-bombers to Baghdad, the capital and political nerve centre of the Iraqi government, {{in order to bring}} some pressure to bear on the allies. The strategic logic of these operations was explicated by an Iraq expert & security analyst Sajad Jiyad; “It’s keeping the ISF on their toes. It’s {{to let them know that}} they can strike anywhere, to force them to spread their forces thin. By letting off such a large series of explosions, it’s sending a message that they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> their forces everywhere.
