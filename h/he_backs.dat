5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{prepares for}} an acting {{job in a}} {{laboratory}} safety video that was arranged by his talent agent, Carla Fern (Roseanne Barr). The directors continuously have {{to talk him out}} of overacting, and <b>he</b> <b>backs</b> down from shooting a scene using an eye wash, since he has an aversion towards anything being shot into his eye. However, Carla threatens to have him blacklisted if he does not go through with the scene. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), who came along as friendly support, gives Andy the confidence to shoot the scene, and in the end Andy even insists on doing two takes.|$|E
5|$|Paul, {{a member}} of his old unit, {{contacts}} him and reveals he is suffering similar terrifying experiences but is immediately killed when his car explodes. Jacob is dragged away from the wreckage by a bespectacled man. Commiserating after the funeral, the members of Jacob's old platoon confess that they have all been experiencing similarly horrifying hallucinations. Believing that they are suffering the effects of a military experiment performed on them without their knowledge or consent, the men hire a lawyer to investigate but <b>he</b> <b>backs</b> out of the case after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged for psychological reasons. Jacob’s comrades soon apprehensively back down – Jacob angrily suspects they have been threatened into doing so. Jacob himself is later thrown into a car with intimidating men in suits who warn him against further investigation. He jumps from the moving car and is injured. He is taken to a hospital where he is restrained on a stretcher and wheeled down corridors full of grotesquely deformed patients before doctors, wielding barbaric metal instruments, inform him he is dead.|$|E
5|$|Picard {{is joined}} by some of his crew to help the Ba'ku escape from being {{abducted}} while Riker takes the Enterprise far enough from the interference zone to communicate the violation to Starfleet. The Son'a send robotic probes to locate and capture the fleeing Ba'ku. The Son'a leader, Ahdar Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham), convinces Dougherty to allow two Son'a ships to attack the Enterprise. Riker defeats the attacking ships and the Enterprise escapes. Their plan exposed, Ru'afo insists upon harvesting the radiation source immediately. Picard, Anij, and several Ba'ku are transported as prisoners onto the Son'a ship. Picard reveals to Dougherty that the Son'a and the Ba'ku are the same race and involving the Federation in a blood feud. The Son'a are a splinter faction of Ba'ku who gave up their bucolic existence a century earlier to embrace the use of technology. They attempted to seize power but failed, and the Ba'ku elders exiled them from the planet, denying them the rejuvenating effects of the rings. The Son'a developed an artificial and imperfect means to extend their lives {{at the cost of}} disfigurement. Ru'afo kills Admiral Dougherty when <b>he</b> <b>backs</b> out of the plan and Ru'afo proceeds with his plan.|$|E

Nance calls for a cultural widespread climate of denouncement of al-Qaeda by the Muslim community, through educating believers in Islam about the harms of al-Qaeda's goals to create an extremist Islamic empire.|$|E

In {{addition}} to eventually releasing his own albums on the label, he initially used {{the company as}} an avenue for collaboration with other musicians. He wanted Dark Horse {{to serve as a}} creative outlet for artists, as Apple Records had for the Beatles. Harrison explained: [...] "Most of the stuff will be what I produce". Eric Idle commented: [...] "He's extremely generous, and <b>he</b> <b>backs</b> and supports all sorts of people that you'll never, ever hear of." [...] The first acts signed to the new label were Ravi Shankar and Splinter, whose album Harrison produced, which provided Dark Horse with their first hit, [...] "Costafine Town". Other artists signed by Dark Horse include Attitudes, Henry McCullough, Jiva, and Stairsteps.|$|E
500|$|Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste {{magazine}} wrote {{highly of}} the episode and called it [...] "a half hour of heartwarming comedy". She was particularly pleased with how Michael was able to overcome Oscar with pathos, and she enjoyed the episode's subplots. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic praised the episode and awarded it five stars out of five. He wrote that [...] "If my favorite thing for Jim to do is prank Dwight, my second favorite is when <b>he</b> <b>backs</b> Michael." [...] Furthermore, he wrote that [...] "While this A story was filled with plenty of laughs, [...] Dwight's B story was absolutely murderous [...] all gold". He also felt that the C plot was enjoyable, because [...] "Andy is great in small doses".|$|E
500|$|... "Golden Ticket" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews, {{with several}} reviewers {{commenting on the}} selfishness and mean behavior of Michael in the episode. In a New York magazine article entitled [...] "Michael Finally Goes Too Far", Will Leitch describes it as [...] "one of the funnier recent episodes", but found Michael's willingness to sell out Dwight unsettling: [...] "Usually, when he’s about to do something over-the-top (like plant drugs on Toby), <b>he</b> <b>backs</b> off at the last second. This time, he's willing {{to go all the}} way and sell out Dwight, his most loyal friend. It's a little jarring." [...] Leitch, however, said the sweetness of the subplot involving Kevin and Lynne offset some of the darker aspects of the episode, and praised several of the jokes including Michael's [...] "Shoe-La-La" [...] shoe store idea, Dwight's idea for a [...] "Horse Boat" [...] invention and the KGB knock knock jokes.|$|E

She said, [...] "You don’t know if they’re {{going to be able}} to capture your voice the same way that you captured it yourself." [...] "Ego" [...] was eventually proposed to Beyoncé, who used it for the deluxe edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce.

Elaborating on her collaboration with West, she told MTV News, [...] " [...] voice sounds so wonderful on it. He definitely has the confidence and <b>he</b> <b>backs</b> it up. And that's what this song is about." [...] The remix was included on the 2009 remix album Above and Beyoncé – Video Collection & Dance Mixes and the platinum edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce. Andrew Burgess of musicOMH criticized West's [...] "lackadaisical and disappointing appearance" [...] on the remix.|$|E
500|$|As {{indicated}} by the title, air, skies and wings are important themes: Yukito is searching for the [...] "girl in the sky", and Misuzu believes that her other self is flying in the sky above her. Other characters show a similar relationship to the sky, such as Minagi {{who is a member}} of the astronomy club,Translated quote: [...] "...There's still club activities...the astronomy club." [...] and Michiru who has a fondness for bubbles that float in the air. Kano wants wings to fly, and Kanna already has them. Misuzu names a crow she finds —Japanese for [...] "sky". Another major theme is the maternal bond, as the four heroines' stories, as well as Yukito's, revolve around their mothers, either biological or adoptive. Main scenario writer Jun Maeda commented that he prefers to include mothers in games if given the choice between only including a mother or a father, as is what happened with Air, though <b>he</b> <b>backs</b> this up by noting that in bishōjo games, women are the main focus anyway. Complicated relationships involving family members and friends play a key part throughout the story. One of the sub-themes in the story is magic.Translated quote: [...] "If you could use sorcery, what do you think would happen?" [...] Uraha, Yukito's mother,Translated quote: [...] "I had inherited the ability to control puppets without touching them from my mother."

Kano was told by her sister that when she grows up and takes off her yellow ribbon, she will gain the power to do magic. However, the problems of parents leaving their offspring and poverty are displayed realistically.|$|E

2500|$|In 1950 chief rabbis Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog and Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel {{issued a}} ruling forbidding women {{to join the}} IDF. In the 1980s Rabbi Meir Kahane ardently opposed women serving in the IDF, advocating {{national}} service instead. [...] As of 2014 David Lau and Yitzhak Yosef of the Chief Rabbinate were opposed to religious women serving in the IDF, as was Safed Chief Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu. However, Finance Minister Yair Lapid opposes this position and wants Lau and Yosef {{to be removed from}} the Chief Rabbinate because of it. Economy Minister Naftali Bennett stated [...] "I believe that all girls should do either IDF service or national service. With that, the attack on the rabbis for their traditional position is an unacceptable attack on the respect due them." [...] Education Minister Shai Piron said <b>he</b> <b>backs</b> the chief rabbis' injunction against observant women enlisting in the IDF. In 2003 Piron had said, “I don’t know of any rabbis that would allow [...] to serve in the army. The halachic authorities saw the reality from a joint education and spiritual perspective, this view led them to their halachic conclusion… The problem with IDF service is the general atmosphere that does not allow for a life without [...] pitfalls.” MK Elazar Stern said, [...] "A week ago the Chief Rabbis announced that a female serving in the IDF results in an aveira similar to Chilul Shabbos. This is tantamount to issuing a call to women, at least those who view themselves as religious, not to serve in the IDF...I served in the IDF for a few years and I state the military cannot function without women unless we lengthen the service of males to 4.5 years. The price that we will pay by the call of the Chief Rabbinate Council that females do not enlist is not that of our daughters, but the daughters of these very same rabbis who don't serve." [...] Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, the Rabbi of the city of Efrat, supports women's enlistment in the IDF. Also, in 2014 the Beit Hillel association of national-religious rabbis issued a ruling in Jewish law stating that women are allowed to serve in the IDF; however, Rabbi Shlomo Aviner claimed that Beit Hillel did not have the authority to make such a ruling.|$|E
