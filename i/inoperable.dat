5|$|Surgical {{resection}} {{offers the}} only potential chance of cure in cholangiocarcinoma. For non-resectable cases, the 5-year survival rate is 0% where {{the disease is}} <b>inoperable</b> because distal lymph nodes show metastases, and less than 5% in general. Overall median duration of survival is less than 6 months in <b>inoperable,</b> untreated, otherwise healthy patients with tumors involving the liver {{by way of the}} intrahepatic bile ducts and hepatic portal vein.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil War, all aircraft, equipment, materiel, and {{facilities}} belonging to the Liberian Air Force were badly damaged, rendering the force <b>inoperable.</b> During the Civil War the Taylor government made a variety of different air support arrangements; a seemingly <b>inoperable</b> Mil Mi-2 and Mil Mi-8, one in Anti-Terrorist Unit markings, could be seen at Spriggs Payne Airport in central Monrovia in mid-2005, apparently a hangover from the war. Meanwhile, during the Taylor era, the Navy consisted of a couple of small patrol craft. However, on shore, both late 1990s and 2005 sources indicate the Navy included the 2nd Naval District, Buchanan, the 3rd Naval District, Greenville, and the 4th Naval District, Harper.|$|E
5|$|Syria {{missed a}} 15 March {{deadline}} for destroying its 12 chemical weapons production facilities. Syria has proposed to instead render the facilities <b>inoperable</b> by sealing their entrances; the U.S. {{and its allies}} oppose this proposal and insist on destruction.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of cases of cholangiocarcinoma present as <b>inoperable</b> (unresectable) disease in which case patients are generally treated with palliative chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. Chemotherapy {{has been shown in}} a randomized controlled trial to improve quality of life and extend survival in patients with <b>inoperable</b> cholangiocarcinoma. There is no single chemotherapy regimen which is universally used, and enrollment in clinical trials is often recommended when possible. Chemotherapy agents used to treat cholangiocarcinoma include 5-fluorouracil with leucovorin, gemcitabine as a single agent, or gemcitabine plus cisplatin, irinotecan, or capecitabine. A small pilot study suggested possible benefit from the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Zappa was {{diagnosed}} with terminal prostate cancer. The disease had been developing unnoticed for ten years and was considered <b>inoperable.</b> After the diagnosis, Zappa devoted most of his energy to modern orchestral and Synclavier works. Shortly {{before his death in}} 1993 he completed Civilization Phaze III, a major Synclavier work which he had begun in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Just twenty {{days after}} Mara's death, on November 15, 2005, Tisch {{died at the}} age of 79. He was {{diagnosed}} in 2004 with <b>inoperable</b> brain cancer. Tisch was a philanthropist all his life and donated considerable sums of money to charitable causes. After his diagnosis, he donated money to institutions aimed towards the research of drugs and treatments to control brain tumors.|$|E
5|$|The RLN may be {{compressed}} by tumors. Studies {{have shown}} that 218% of lung cancer patients develop hoarseness because of recurrent laryngeal nerve compression, usually left-sided. This is associated with worse outcomes, and when found as a presenting symptom, often indicates <b>inoperable</b> tumors. The nerve may be severed intentionally during lung cancer surgery in order to fully remove a tumor.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. When Scully is {{diagnosed}} with an <b>inoperable</b> nasopharyngeal tumor, Mulder attempts to discover {{what happened to her}} during her abduction experience, believing the two events to be related.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the game}} begins, the player character's {{parachute}} fails to open. Awakening hours later, the character finds almost all his equipment <b>inoperable.</b> Reaching the pyramid on foot {{hours after the}} rest of the team entered the structure, the player must complete the team's mission before the god awakens in five days. In the pyramid, the player finds bodies of squad-mates, the remains of Spanish-speaking treasure hunters, and fallen members of a Nazi expedition from the 1930s who were looking for a secret weapon but never returned. Additional plot elements can be revealed by speaking to these dead, enabled by an item attainable early in the game, the yellow crystal.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 18th century, Tilbury Fort {{was one of the most}} {{powerful}} in Britain. The number of artillery guns varied; in 1715 there were 17 demi-cannon and 26 culverins mounted on the west gun platform, and 31 demi-cannons and one culverin on the east; the following year there were reported to be 161 guns in total at the fort, although 92 of these were in poor repair and <b>inoperable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{considered}} to be an incurable and rapidly lethal cancer unless both the primary tumor and any metastases can be fully removed by surgery. No potentially curative treatment exists except surgery, but most people have advanced stage disease at presentation and are <b>inoperable</b> at the time of diagnosis. People with cholangiocarcinoma are generally managed - though not cured - with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other palliative care measures. These are also used as additional therapies after surgery in cases where resection has apparently been successful (or nearly so).|$|E
5|$|Coordination {{of rescue}} efforts August 29 and August 30 were made {{difficult}} by {{disruption of the}} communications infrastructure. Many telephones, including most cell phones, and Internet access were <b>inoperable</b> because of line breaks, destruction of base stations, or power failures, even though some base stations had their own back-up generators. In a number of cases, reporters were asked to brief public officials on the conditions in areas where information was not reaching them any other way.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan was {{afflicted by}} illness {{in his final}} years. He was {{diagnosed}} with throat cancer in 1993 before contracting an <b>inoperable</b> lung cancer, which led to his death on 6 February 1999. A public memorial service was held on 9 February at the Adelaide Festival Centre {{as a tribute to}} Dunstan's love of the arts. In attendance were former Labor Prime Ministers Gough Whitlam and Bob Hawke, Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley, Premier John Olsen, and State Opposition Leader Mike Rann. Thousands more gathered outside the centre in Elder Park {{along the banks of the}} River Torrens. State flags were flown at half-mast and the memorial service was televised live.|$|E
5|$|Mexican actor Pedro Armendáriz was {{recommended}} to Young by director John Ford to play Kerim Bey. After experiencing increasing discomfort {{on location in}} Istanbul, Armendáriz was diagnosed with <b>inoperable</b> cancer. Filming in Istanbul was terminated, the production moved to Britain, and Armendáriz's scenes were brought forward {{so that he could}} complete his scenes without delay. Though visibly in pain, he continued working as long as possible. When he could no longer work, he returned home and took his own life. Remaining shots after Armendáriz left London had a stunt double and Terence Young himself as stand-ins.|$|E
5|$|Past {{servicing}} missions have exchanged old {{instruments for}} new ones, both avoiding failure and making possible {{new types of}} science. Without servicing missions, all of the instruments will eventually fail. In August 2004, the power system of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) failed, rendering the instrument <b>inoperable.</b> The electronics had originally been fully redundant, but {{the first set of}} electronics failed in May 2001. This power supply was fixed during Servicing Mission 4 in May 2009.|$|E
5|$|Prognostic {{factors in}} NSCLC include {{presence}} of pulmonary symptoms, large tumor size (>3cm), nonsquamous cell type (histology), degree of spread (stage) and metastases to multiple lymph nodes, and vascular invasion. For people with <b>inoperable</b> disease, outcomes are worse {{in those with}} poor performance status and weight loss of more than 10%. Prognostic factors in small cell lung cancer include performance status, gender, stage of disease, and involvement of {{the central nervous system}} or liver at the time of diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The few {{contraindications}} {{to surgery}} include <b>inoperable</b> tumor, massive obesity, a particularly high-risk operation, or {{a desire to}} preserve fertility. These contraindications happen in about 5–10% of cases. Women who wish to preserve their fertility and have low-grade stage I cancer can be treated with progestins, with or without concurrent tamoxifen therapy. This therapy can be continued until the cancer does not respond to treatment or until childbearing is done. Uterine perforation may occur during a D or an endometrial biopsy. Side effects of surgery to remove endometrial cancer can specifically include sexual dysfunction, temporary incontinence, and lymphedema, along with more common side effects of any surgery, including constipation.|$|E
5|$|The line {{judge is}} {{positioned}} {{on the end}} of the line of scrimmage, opposite the head linesman. He or she supervises player substitutions, the line of scrimmage during punts, and game timing. He notifies the referee when time has expired at the end of a quarter and notifies the head coach of the home team when five minutes remain for halftime. In the NFL, the line judge also alerts the referee when two minutes remain in the half. If the clock malfunctions or becomes <b>inoperable,</b> the line judge becomes the official timekeeper.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} Cook Islands were {{hardest hit}} by Percy as the storm left 640people homeless, of which 600 were in Pukapuka, and 40 were in Nassau. Of the buildings and houses destroyed or severely damaged, only ten were left standing. One person was rescued when his fishing boat stalled during the storm. Percy also damaged a solar power station, making it <b>inoperable.</b> Percy also battered the southern Cook Islands while weakening, although the damage there was minimal.|$|E
5|$|After {{a memorable}} 90th birthday, {{where she was}} {{surrounded}} by her now vast family, Zita's strong health began to fail. She developed <b>inoperable</b> cataracts in both eyes. Her last big family gathering took place at Zizers, in 1987, when her children and grandchildren joined in celebrating Empress Zita's 95th birthday. While visiting her daughter, in summer 1988, she developed pneumonia {{and spent most of}} the autumn and winter bedridden. Finally, she called Otto, in early March 1989, and told him she was dying. He {{and the rest of the}} family travelled to her bedside and took turns keeping her company until she died in the early hours of 14 March 1989. She was 96 years old, and was the last surviving child of Robert, Duke of Parma from both his marriages.|$|E
5|$|As well as addition, subtraction, {{multiplication}} and division, it had reciprocal and square-root functions, and {{the ability}} to multiply by a fixed constant. With an eight-digit display, the calculator could display positive numbers between 0.0000001 and 99,999,999, and negative numbers between -0.000001 and -9,999,999. Calculators of the time tended to have displays of between 3 and 12 digits, as reducing the number of digits was an effective way of reducing the cost of the calculator. A number outside that range leads to an overflow, and the screen flashes and all keys except the clear key are rendered <b>inoperable</b> to inform the user of the error. A independent memory register could read information from the screen, and information could only be taken from the memory onto the screen. Five keys were used for memory operations.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in July 1914, Greece's pro-German monarch, Constantine I, decided to remain neutral. The Entente powers landed troops in Salonika in 1915, which {{was a source of}} tension between France and Greece. Ultimately, the French seized the Hellenic Navy on 19 October 1916 (see Noemvriana and National Schism). Kilkis was reduced to a skeleton crew and had the breech blocks for her guns removed to render them <b>inoperable.</b> All ammunition and torpedoes were also removed. Ultimately, a pro-Entente government replaced Constantine and declared war on the Central Powers. Kilkis, however, did not see active service with Greece's new allies, and instead was used solely for harbor defense {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Doctors {{initially}} told Kennedy {{the tumor}} was <b>inoperable,</b> but he looked around for other opinions and decided on the most aggressive and exhausting course of treatment possible. On June 2, 2008, Kennedy underwent brain surgery at Duke University Medical Center {{in an attempt to}} remove as much of the tumor as possible. The 3½-hour operation, conducted by Dr. Allan Friedman while Kennedy was conscious to minimize any permanent neurological effects, was deemed successful in its goals. Kennedy left the hospital a week later to begin a course of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Opinions varied regarding Kennedy's prognosis: the surgery typically only extended survival time by a matter of months, but sometimes people lived for years.|$|E
5|$|Her refit at Portsmouth Dockyard {{began in}} March 1914 and was {{interrupted}} by the declaration of war on Germany on 4 August. She'd been formally recommissioned the day prior, but the turret work required another week to complete. Invincible was the first battlecruiser to be fitted with a new fire-control director, but this could not be completed in the allotted time and would remain <b>inoperable</b> until she was refitted after the Battle of the Falkland Islands. She was declared operational on 12 August, when Rear-Admiral Sir Archibald Gordon Moore, commanding the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron, hoisted his flag in her. He was ordered to the Humber, along with the battlecruiser , where he could better support the British ships patrolling the Broad Fourteens.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Chapman made {{a routine}} {{visit to a}} dentist, who found a small, but {{malignant}} tumour {{on one of his}} tonsils, leading to both being removed via a tonsillectomy. The following year, the cancer had spread into Chapman's spinal cord, where another tumour was surgically removed. Chapman had several chemotherapy treatments and surgeries during the final months of his life, but ultimately the cancer was declared <b>inoperable.</b> According to his brother, Chapman was visibly upset by the death of his mother that July, by which time he was terminally ill. Shortly afterwards, Chapman filmed scenes for the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of Flying Circus, the final time he appeared on television.|$|E
5|$|On April 14, 1960, Cooper {{underwent}} surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston for an aggressive form {{of prostate cancer}} which had metastasized to his colon. He fell ill again on May 31 and underwent further surgery at Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles in early June to remove a malignant tumor from his large intestine. After recuperating over the summer, Cooper took his family on vacation {{to the south of}} France before traveling to England in the fall to make his last film, The Naked Edge. In December 1960, he worked on the NBC television documentary The Real West, which was part of the company's Project 20 series. On December 27, his wife learned from their family doctor that Cooper's cancer had spread to his lungs and bones and was <b>inoperable.</b> His family decided not to tell him immediately.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Wales and Repulse {{were the}} first capital ships to be sunk solely by naval air power on the open sea (albeit by {{land-based}} rather than carrier-based aircraft), a harbinger of the diminishing role this class of ships was to play in naval warfare thereafter. It is often pointed out, however, that contributing factors to the sinking of Prince of Wales were her surface-scanning radars being <b>inoperable,</b> depriving Force Z {{of one of its}} most potent early-warning devices and the critical early damage she sustained from the first torpedo. Another factor which led to Prince of Waless demise was the loss of dynamos, depriving Prince of Wales of many of her electric pumps. Further electrical failures left parts of the ship in total darkness, and added to the difficulties of her damage repair parties as they attempted to counter the flooding.|$|E
5|$|Several {{designs for}} the exact method of {{destroying}} the target were suggested. One of these {{was to have the}} satellite carry out a kamikaze attack on the target, while another was to coat it with black paint, blocking its ability to see or transmit, rendering it <b>inoperable.</b> Yet another was for it to use a laser to disable reconnaissance or optical sensors of the target. Another suggestion was for the satellite to carry a nuclear missile, of up to one megaton yield, and launch it at the satellite. However, in July 1959, Joseph V. Charyk directed that all technical efforts were to be focused on developing the inspection function, rather than the kill function, effectively ending its role as a satellite interceptor, and shifting the project {{to the development of a}} satellite inspector.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} briefly {{saved by the}} war against the Seminoles in Florida which {{provided}} the first sale of Colt's revolvers and his new revolving rifles. The soldiers in Florida praised the new weapon, but the unusual hammerless design, sixty years ahead of its time, led to difficulty in training men who were used to exposed-hammer guns. Consequently, many curious soldiers took the locks apart. This resulted in breakage of parts, stripped screw heads and <b>inoperable</b> guns. Colt soon reworked his design to leave the firing hammer exposed, but problems continued. In late 1843, after the loss of payment for the Florida pistols, the Paterson plant closed and a public auction was held in New York City to sell the company's most liquid assets.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, the {{starboard}} propshaft seal sprung a major leak in the after engine room. A makeshift locking clamp was jury-rigged {{to contain the}} leak. On 12 March, the trouble-plagued fathometer ceased operation when its transducer header flooded, grounding out the entire system. Since the transducer head was located outside the boat's pressure hull, {{it could not be}} repaired except in drydock. Without an operational fathometer, Triton could be vulnerable to grounding or collision with uncharted submerged formations. It was subsequently determined that the cabling to the Tritons fathometer head, located in the bulbous forefoot of her bow, had not been properly insulated, and the constant buffeting from Tritons high speed caused these cables to rupture, rendering the fathometer <b>inoperable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Washington {{passed through}} the area still {{occupied}} by the damaged and sinking U.S. destroyers and fired on Ayanami with her secondary batteries, setting her afire. Following close behind, South Dakota suddenly suffered a series of electrical failures, reportedly during repairs when her chief engineer locked down a circuit breaker in violation of safety procedures, causing her circuits repeatedly to go into series, making her radar, radios, and most of her gun batteries <b>inoperable.</b> However, she continued to follow Washington towards {{the western side of}} Savo Island until 23:35, when Washington changed course left to pass to the southward behind the burning destroyers. South Dakota tried to follow but had to turn to right to avoid Benham, which resulted in the ship's being silhouetted by the fires of the burning destroyers and made her a closer and easier target for the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Lindemann {{may have}} left his combat {{position}} when the ship's controls were rendered <b>inoperable,</b> and {{prior to the}} lethal hit on the command position, {{in order to give}} the command to abandon the ship. The surviving Matrose Paul Hillen—who had managed to escape to the upper deck in the final phase of the battle, stated that he had seen a group of 20–30 people standing at the bow, among them a man with a white peaked cap. Normally on a German naval vessel at sea, a white cap is worn only by the commanding officer. In addition, the surviving Maschinengefreiter—Rudolf Römer, who at the time was already in the water—claimed that he had seen Lindemann standing on the bow, near Bismarcks forward 38cm turret, Anton. He was said to be with his combat messenger, a leading seaman, and apparently trying to persuade his messenger to save himself. In this account, his messenger took Lindemann's hand and the two walked to the forward flagmast. As the ship turned over, the two stood briefly to attention, then Lindemann and his messenger saluted. As the ship rolled to port, the messenger fell into the water. Lindemann continued his salute while clinging to the flagmast, going under with the ship.|$|E
5|$|Anya closes a {{restaurant}} where four men—northerners Archie, Malcolm and Kevin are entertaining southerner Craig—have finished a post-badminton meal. After a misunderstanding between Craig and the thickly accented Anya, Malcolm takes the bill, {{but he and}} Archie both wish to pay. Craig insists that he will pay, as he is leaving, and wealthier than the others. The three argue, with Archie unable to pay as the card machine lacks paper. Malcolm suggests that the bill should be split three ways, with the northerners treating Craig, but Kevin {{claims to be the}} poorest. Archie, Malcolm and Craig thrust cards at Anya until Kevin offers to pay. He counts cash as Anya fetches drinks. Craig thanks the others for making his trip bearable, and offers to pay, restarting the argument. This becomes about Malcolm's position as badminton-club secretary, with Malcolm revealing that Archie has spent time in prison. Anya arrives with drinks, and Craig, paying the bill, speaks of craving excitement, only to have his card declined. He phones his au pair for a card, keen she not look in the wrong drawer, but Malcolm snatches the phone. He is about to pay, but Archie stops him. He reveals that he wanted to pay as he has an <b>inoperable</b> brain tumour.|$|E
5|$|Archival {{data of the}} II SS-Panzer Corps {{shows that}} the corps had 294 {{operable}} tanks and assault guns {{on the evening of}} 11 July, and 251 on the evening of 13 July. Allowing for the possibility that some repaired tanks were returned to service on 13 July, these numbers indicate that at least 43 tanks and assault guns became <b>inoperable</b> during this period, which includes all ten Tigers belonging to Totenkopf and one belonging to Leibstandarte. An estimated total of 60–80 tanks and assault guns of the II SS-Panzer Corps were damaged or destroyed in combat on 12 July. By the end of 16 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps had 292 serviceable tanks and assault guns, almost the same number it had {{at the beginning of the}} battle on 12 July. On 12 July, Schlachtgeschwader 1 of the 8th Air Corps and its attached squadron of Stukas reported 11 aircraft damaged, all by Soviet anti-aircraft artillery, of which 6 were total write-offs.|$|E
5|$|At night, a Syrian {{expeditionary force}} {{attempted}} to infiltrate Degania Bet, but was caught and warded off, which caused the main Syrian force to attack Degania Alef first. At 06:00, the Syrians started a frontal armored attack, consisting of 5 tanks, {{a number of}} armored vehicles and an infantry company. The Syrians pierced the Israeli defense, but their infantry was at some distance behind the tanks. The Israelis knocked out four Syrian tanks and four armored cars with 20mm cannons, PIATs and Molotov cocktails. Meanwhile, other defenders kept small arms fire on the Syrian infantry, who stopped in citrus groves a few hundred meters from the settlements. The surviving Syrian tanks withdrew back to the Golan. At 07:45, the Syrians halted their assault and dug in, still holding most of the territory between Degania Alef's fence and Samakh's police fort. They left behind a number of lightly damaged or otherwise <b>inoperable</b> tanks that the Israelis managed to repair.|$|E
