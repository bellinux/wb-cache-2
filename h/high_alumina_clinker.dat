The process {{can help to}} select low-cost commercially available oxides and can produce powders with nanometer size granules. On the other hand, <b>high</b> <b>alumina</b> cement provides <b>high</b> service temperature when used as refractory castable. Therefore, the effects of high-energy ball milling and subsequent calcinations on the formation of <b>high</b> <b>alumina</b> cementing phases using mixtures of Al 2 O 3 and CaCO 3 were investigated. Nano-meter sized <b>high</b> <b>alumina</b> cement (HAC) powders were synthesized by mechanochemical treatment of Al 2 O 3 and CaCO 3 in weight ratios 7 : 3 and 8 : 2. This paper compares the calcined <b>high</b> <b>alumina</b> cement obtained by mechanically activated precursor mix for 1, 2 and 3 h. Low cement castables were prepared from calcined Chinese bauxite as aggregate matrix, prepared HAC acting as hydraulic binder and micro-fine additives as pore filling agents. The bonding of <b>high</b> <b>alumina</b> cement as well as sinterability in these castable was studied with ZrO 2, α-Al 2 O 3 and SiC as micro-fine additives. Castables formulated by prepared <b>high</b> <b>alumina</b> cement demonstrate remarkably improved bulk density and apparent porosity as when compared with those prepared by commercially available cement. Casting water demand was also reduced, as a result quick setting behavior was observed.

Disc shaped zirconia (In-Ceram Zirconia) and <b>high</b> <b>alumina</b> (Procera AllCeram) ceramic specimens (diameter: 15 min and thickness: 1. 2 mm) were fabricated according to the manufacturers' instructions. The specimens from each ceramic material (N = 40, n = 10 /per group) were tested for flexural strength either with or without being subjected to mechanical cycling (20, 000 cycles under 50 N load, immersion in distilled water at 37 degrees C) in a universal testing machine (1 mm/min). Data were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (alpha = 0. 05). Results. <b>High</b> <b>alumina</b> ceramic specimens revealed significantly higher flexural strength values without and with mechanical cycling (647 +/- 48 and 630 +/- 143 MPa, respectively) than those of zirconia ceramic (497 +/- 35 and 458 +/- 53 MPa, respectively) (p < 0. 05). Mechanical cycling for 20, 000 times under 50 N decreased the flexural strength values for both <b>high</b> <b>alumina</b> and Significance. <b>High</b> <b>alumina</b> ceramic revealed significantly higher mean flexural strength values than that of zirconia ceramic tested in this study either with or without mechanical cycling conditions.

40|$|The {{composition}} and properties of blast furnace slags greatly affect the furnace productivity {{and the quality}} of hot metal produced. Viscosity is an important physical property of slags, strongly influenced by the chemical composition, structure and the temperature. Experimental measurement of slag viscosity requires high temperature equipment and is time consuming. Therefore, chemical parameters are used to identify trends in viscosity as function of chemical composition. Limited information is available for <b>High</b> <b>Alumina</b> Blast Furnace Slags, since much of the open literature deals with Low Alumina Slags, with alumina content less than 15 weight percentage. <b>High</b> <b>Alumina</b> slags (alumina content in the range of 15 % to 30 %) are predominantly encountered in Indian Blast Furnaces. It appears that these slags have higher viscosity and lower sulphide capacity than the low alumina slags.

40|$|This paper reports {{findings}} of ongoing {{investigation into the}} effect of <b>high</b> <b>alumina</b> ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) on sulphate resistance of concrete. Slags used in most countries contain low alumina contents and provide high resistance to sulphate attack among other durability improvements.

South African slags have moderately <b>high</b> <b>alumina</b> contents but hardly any {{studies have been conducted}} to determine its influence on sulphate resistance of concretes. In this investigation, commercially available slag widely used in South Africa was used. Mortar prisms 25 x 25 x 285 mm of 0. 5 water-binder ratio incorporating 30 %, 50 %, 70 % GGBS were prepared and immersed in sodium sulphate solutions of different concentrations of 28 g/L and 50 g/L as SO 4.
