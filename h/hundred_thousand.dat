5|$|The Kaga Rebellion or Chōkyō Uprising was a {{large-scale}} revolt in Kaga Province (present-day southern Ishikawa Prefecture), Japan, in late 1487 through 1488. Togashi Masachika, who ruled Kaga Province as shugo, had been restored {{to power in}} 1473 with aid from the Asakura clan {{as well as the}} Ikkō-ikki, a loose collection of lesser nobility, monks, and farmers. By 1474, however, the Ikkō-ikki grew discontent with Masachika, and launched some initial revolts, which were easily quelled. In 1487, when Masachika left on a military campaign, between one <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> and two <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> Ikkō-ikki revolted. Masachika returned with his army, but the Ikkō-ikki, backed by several disaffected vassal families, overwhelmed his army and surrounded him in his palace, where he committed seppuku. The former vassals of Masachika granted the position of shugo to Masachika's uncle Yasutaka, but over the next several decades the Ikkō-ikki increased their political hold on the province, which they would effectively control for almost a century.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{previous}} revolts having been easily suppressed, unrest continued to simmer in Kaga under Masachika's governance.

In 1487, Masachika left with a large army for Ōmi Province {{in response to a}} call for aid from shogun Ashikaga Yoshihisa, who was attempting to suppress the robber baron Rokkaku Tokoyori. In Masachika's absence, the Ikkō-ikki, led by Rengo, Renkō, and Rensei, three sons of Rennyo, launched their revolt and between one <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> and two <b>hundred</b> <b>thousand</b> members took up arms. Masachika quickly returned from his military expedition, and defeated the rebels in several battles. However, several vassal families, discontent with Masachika, joined with the rebels.

Masachika, trapped in a burning castle and faced with certain defeat, committed seppuku.
