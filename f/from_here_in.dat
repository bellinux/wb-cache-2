5|$|M-5 {{starts at}} a {{roundabout}} intersection with Pontiac Trail in Commerce Township. It runs south-southwesterly <b>from</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Oakland County as a divided highway between suburban residential subdivisions in the township. South of Maple Road, the highway is bordered by commercial developments {{to the east}} and Long Park to the west as it angles southeasterly. Between 14 and 13Mile roads, the highway is once again bounded by subdivisions. Along this part of the trunkline, access to the road is limited to major intersections only, making the highway an expressway. Immediately south of the 13Mile Road intersection, M-5's median widens out as the highway transitions to a full freeway called the Haggerty Connector. Traffic can only access the highway at grade-separated interchanges instead of at-grade intersections. A collector-distributor lane setup parallels the main freeway lanes proving access to the ramps at the 12Mile Road interchange as well as ramps from the massive interchange with I-96, I-275 and I-696. Through this interchange complex that straddles the Novi–Farmington Hills city line, M-5 turns to the southeast, and signage changes direction. The Haggerty Connector is signed north–south, while the rest of M-5 is signed east–west. M-5 has direct connections with ramps to I-696 and I-96 east/I-275 south as it crosses over into Farmington Hills.|$|E

2500|$|In Portuguese-, Spanish- and Italian-speaking countries, among others, it {{is known}} as Carnival (to use the English spelling).

The use of the term [...] "carnival" [...] in other contexts derives <b>from</b> <b>here.</b> <b>In</b> Spain, the Carnival Tuesday is named [...] "día de la tortilla" [...] ("omelette day"): an omelette made with some sausage or pork fat is eaten. On the Portuguese island of Madeira, they eat malasadas on Terça-feira Gorda (Fat Tuesday in English) which is also {{the last day of the}} Carnival of Madeira. Malasadas were cooked in order to use up all the lard and sugar in the house, in preparation for Lent. This tradition was taken to Hawaii, where Shrove Tuesday is known as Malasada Day, which dates back to the days of the sugar plantations of the 1800s, the resident Catholic Portuguese (mostly from Madeira and the Azores) workers used up butter and sugar prior to Lent by making large batches of malasadas.|$|E
