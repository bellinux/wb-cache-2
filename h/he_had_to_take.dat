5|$|Mahendra's {{passion for}} cinema {{prompted}} him to leave for India and join the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune in 1966. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up cinematography as he could not gain admissions to other disciplines. At the institute he was exposed to world cinema as he got an opportunity to watch films made by François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, both associated with the French New Wave movement. In 1969, Mahendra graduated from the institute with a gold medal.|$|E
5|$|Bok began {{a ten-year}} period of slavery {{at the hands}} of Giemma and his son Hamid. He was forced to tend the family's herds of livestock. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them to {{pastures}} in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began to suspect that his life was going to change forever and that his father {{was not going to be}} able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{while working}} long hours on his {{definitive}} book on gear cutting machinery, his energy gave {{out and he}} suffered a “nervous breakdown.” <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> time off to recover. In 1910, he accepted a job offer {{to work in a}} machine tool company in Vermont. He continued to write on technical and other matters throughout his life and would develop a broader philosophy of the role of industry in society. In 1938, he received a Worcester Reed Warner Medal in recognition of his technical writing.|$|E

5|$|Luang Pu Sodh {{was born}} as Sodh Mikaewnoi on 10 October 1884 to a {{relatively}} well-off family of rice merchants in Amphoe Song Phi Nong, Suphan Buri, a province 102km west of Bangkok in central Thailand. His father was called Ngen and his mother Soodjai. He received part of his schooling in the temple of his uncle, a Buddhist monk, when he was nine years old. He therefore became familiar with Buddhism from an early age. He also showed qualities of being an intelligent autodidact. When Sodh's uncle moved to Wat Hua Bho, he took Sodh with him to teach him further. After a while his uncle left the monkhood, but Ngen managed to send Sodh to study with Luang Por Sub, the abbot of Wat Bangpla. This is where Sodh learnt the Khmer language. When he was thirteen years old, he finished his Khmer studies there and returned home to help his father. Father Ngen ran a rice-trading business, shipping rice from Suphanburi to sell to rice mills in Bangkok and Nakhon Chai Si District. At the age of fourteen, Ngen died, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> responsibility for the family business, being the first son. This {{had an impact on}} him: thieves and other threats brought home to him the futility of the household life, and at the age of eighteen, he desired to be ordained as a monk. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of his family first though, and saved up money for {{them to be able to}} leave behind after he would become a monk. The biography of Wat Phra Dhammakaya says that he had to calculate the rate of inflation for this, and work harder than before, but finally managed to gather enough funds after four years.|$|E
5|$|Gale {{concluded}} that {{to relieve the}} pressure on the division, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Bréville. The only units available for the attack were the division reserve, which consisted of the 12th Parachute Battalion (350 men), and 'D' Company 12th Battalion Devonshire Regiment (eighty-six men). Another unit, the 22nd Independent Parachute Company, the division's pathfinders, were to stand by and respond to any German counter-attack. To provide fire support, Gale was given a squadron of tanks from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars, three field artillery regiments armed with 25 pounder guns, a medium artillery regiment of 5.5 inch guns and the division's own artillery the 53rd (Worcester Yeomanry) Airlanding Light Regiment. The attack on Bréville would start at 22:00, timed to catch the Germans tired and off-guard following the days fighting. The start line was on the outskirts of Amfreville, which had already been secured by No.6 Commando.|$|E
5|$|Nataraja Mudaliar {{sought the}} advice of his friend, the theatre artist Pammal Sambandha Mudaliar, who {{suggested}} that he should depict the story of the Mahabharata characters Draupadi and Kichaka. Some of Nataraja Mudaliar's relatives objected to it as they felt {{that it was not a}} proper story for his debut venture. Nataraja Mudaliar, however, decided to proceed and launched his directorial debut titled Keechaka Vadham, which was based on an episode from the Mahabharatha. The episode follows the attempts made by Keechaka, one of the generals of King Virata, to woo and marry Draupadi. Keechaka's misbehaviour with Draupadi prompts the latter to inform Bhima about it. Bhima kills him. Nataraja Mudaliar was not a writer, so <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> assistance from his close friend C. Rangavadivelu, a lawyer by profession. Besides writing the screenplay, Rangavadivelu agreed to coach artists on sets. Nataraja Mudaliar engaged stage actors Raju Mudaliar and Jeevarathnam to play the roles of Keechaka and Draupadi respectively. The total budget of the film was 35,000, which was then considered expensive.|$|E

5|$|With the {{graduation}} of Luis Guzmán, Fernández switched {{back to his}} natural position at point guard in his junior campaign. Fernandez was a preseason All-Atlantic 10 Second Team selection. He was on the watchlist for the Bob Cousy Award honoring the top point guard in college basketball. A shooting slump that lasted {{the majority of the}} season saw his field goal percentage drop to 35.5%, his three point percentage drop to 33.3%, and his scoring average drop to 11.2 points per game. He still led the team in assists, with 3.9 per game. Fernández did miss four games {{in the middle of the}} season due to a bone bruise in his knee, but the shooting slump was more devastating and caused him to consult a sports psychologist. One of the worst games of his career was in an Atlantic 10 Tournament loss to Richmond, in which he went 3-for-17 from the field and committed three turnovers. After the game Fran Dunphy convinced Fernández that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> less shots and get his teammates involved.|$|E

All of this left Herbert to take his maiden Grand Prix win – he was euphoric and was held shoulder high on the podium by the second and third-placed men, Coulthard and Alesi.|$|E

25|$|This {{tour was}} a {{particularly}} tough one for the West Indies, where they struggled in most departments, however the fielding continued to improve {{under the guidance of}} Fountain.

Kouhei then contacts Sae, telling her that he plans to go to Tokyo to find her. However, on the fishing boat's last trip, Kouhei's father had a heart attack and died. Kouhei is then unable to leave for Tokyo, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of his mother and younger sister.|$|E

25|$|On 16 December, Lampard {{scored a}} crucial 79th minute winning goal against Portsmouth and on 20 December, Lampard scored a penalty against his former club West Ham in a 1–1 draw, however <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his spot-kick three times due to players {{running into the}} box too early, he {{nonetheless}} scored all three. In Chelsea's 7–2 thrashing of Sunderland in January 2010, Lampard scored twice to add to his league tally. On 27 January 2010, Lampard again scored two goals, in Chelsea's 3–0 win over Birmingham City in the Premier League. On 27 February, Lampard yet again scored twice against Manchester City but despite his contribution Chelsea went on to lose the game 4–2 at home, {{for the first time}} in 38 games.|$|E
25|$|The King {{knew that}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Paris if he stood {{any chance of}} ruling all of France. This, however, was no easy task. The Catholic League's presses and {{supporters}} continued to spread stories about atrocities committed against Catholic priests and the laity in Protestant England (see Forty Martyrs of England and Wales). The city prepared {{to fight to the}} death rather than accept a Calvinist king. The Battle of Ivry, fought on March 14, 1590, was another victory for the king, and Henry's forces went on to lay siege to Paris, but the siege was broken by Spanish support. Realising that his predecessor had been right {{and that there was no}} prospect of a Protestant king succeeding in Catholic Paris, Henry reputedly uttered the famous phrase Paris vaut bien une messe (Paris is well worth a mass). He was formally received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1593 and was crowned at Chartres in 1594.|$|E
