This article presents the requirements for locking of the devices. A previously used locking test method and its disadvantages are discussed. The article suggests an improved test method and test equipment. Measurement of the test mass acceleration is the most important improvement introduced into the test method.

40|$|Summary. — Southern Peru can {{be divided}} into 3 {{longitudinal}} zones : the coast range, high plains (about 3 000 ft) known as the Pampas, the main Sierra, gently sloping towards the aggradational Altiplano of lake Titicaca. Occasionally, the Pampas are separated from the Sierra by cristalline hills and intermediate brnins, the main one being the Arequipa trough, filled with a welded tuff, the sillar. The main chronological stages appear to be : — main uplift raising the late miocène Puna surface of erosion, cut in the Sierra, over the Pampas and Arequipa basin; an active volcanic period (chachani, then barroso) may have taken place after the uplift. The deposit of the sillar welded tuff is likely to have taken place during the chachani stage, which is about 3 million years old; — erosion in the Arequipa trough and correlative deposition of the <b>glacis</b> <b>type</b> alluvium of the Pampas; — joint uplift of all parts of the region (Coast range, Pampas, Arequipa basin, Sierra) in Pleistocene times, through a coastal warping or uplifting accounting for an uplift of about 3 000 ft.

40|$|The {{process of}} arresting a {{fall from a height}} by {{protective}} equipment is characterised by {{two most important}} values: the arrest force and the distance over which the fall arrest oc-curs. The time course of these values is determined primarily by the mechanical parameters of the connecting and shock-absorbing components of the fall arrest system, such as textile energy absorbers, retractable <b>type</b> <b>fall</b> arresters and guided <b>type</b> <b>fall</b> arresters. The paper presents the methods of testing used up till now to determine the properties of connect-ing and shock-absorbing components.

The method presented and test stand are based on simultaneous measurements of the force acting in the object inves-tigated and its elongation. For measurements of elongation under dynamic conditions, an extensometer equipped with a high speed camera was used. The results of tests performed under static and dynamic conditions on objects made of fibre rope and webbing used in equipment protecting against falls from a height are presented.
