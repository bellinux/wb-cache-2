5|$|According to Ian Smith's memoirs, Van der Byl {{organised}} {{a meeting}} between Ian Smith and Lieutenant-General Peter Walls, Commander of the Rhodesian Army, shortly before the first Zimbabwean elections in February 1980, where they agreed a strategy to prevent Robert Mugabe winning. They met again on 26 February the day before polling began in the Common Roll election. The consensus at this meeting was that Abel Muzorewa's interim government would win enough seats, when put together with the 20 seats reserved for whites which were all Rhodesian Front, to deny Mugabe victory. However, the early election results in March <b>dented</b> this confidence.|$|E
5|$|For the Persians, the two {{expeditions to}} Greece {{had been largely}} successful; new territories had been added to their empire and Eretria had been punished.

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>dent</b> imperfections on the elastic stress behavior of cylindrical shells is explored. This problem is of central {{importance to the}} prediction of fatigue failure due to <b>dents</b> in petroleum pipelines. Using an approximate technique called the Equivalent Load Method, a semi-analytical model of two-dimensional <b>dent</b> stress behavior is developed. In the three-dimensional situation, decreased <b>dent</b> localization, in particular <b>dent</b> length, and increased <b>dent</b> depth are confirmed to cause <b>dent</b> stress concentration behavior to shift from having a single peak at the <b>dent</b> center to having peaks at the <b>dent</b> periphery. It is demonstrated that the equivalent load method does not predict this shift in stress behavior and cannot be relied upon to analyze relatively small, deep imperfections. The two stress modes of <b>dents</b> are associated with two modes of <b>dent</b> fatigue behavior that have significantly different fatigue lives. A method for distinguishing longer lived Mode P <b>dents</b> from shorter lived Mode C <b>dents</b> based on two measured features of <b>dent</b> geometry is developed and validated. An approach for implementing this analysis in the evaluation of real <b>dents</b> is also suggested...|$|R
5|$|In a real vector space, a {{non-empty}} setQ {{is defined}} to be convex if, for {{each pair of}} its points, every point on the line segment that joins them is a subset ofQ. For example, a solid disk is convex but a circle is not, {{because it does not}} contain a line segment joining its points; the non-convex set of three integers{0,1,2} is contained in the interval, which is convex. For example, a solid cube is convex; however, anything that is hollow or <b>dented,</b> for example, a crescent shape, is non-convex. The emptyset is convex, either by definition or vacuously, depending on the author.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} few months, RhAR patrols in the Chaah, Labis, Bekok and Sungai Karas areas were stepped up to last between 10 and 18 days each, but {{contacts}} with the communist forces remained rare. The constant patrols gradually began to take their toll on the insurgents, and guerrillas began to give themselves up increasingly frequently. A contributing factor here was Britain's granting of independence to Malaya within the Commonwealth on 31 August 1957, which <b>dented</b> the motivation of many fighters. Starting in October 1957, the RhAR were tasked to work alongside former MNLA personnel to wipe out any remaining communist forces in the region. The ex-insurgents were supposed to lead the security forces to MNLA camps and resting places, but this strategy was not successful. The RhAR soon developed a low opinion of these ex-MNLA men.|$|E

40|$|Historical {{records show}} t hat the Midwestern <b>dent</b> corns of the United States {{originated}} from hybridization of two landraces, Northern Flint and Southern <b>Dent.</b> We examined {{the origin of}} Southern and Midwestern <b>Dents</b> by means of isozyme electrophoresis. Isozyme genotypes were determined for 23 loci in 12 plants each of 32 accessions of Southern <b>Dent.</b> Previously published isozyme data for maize landraces of Mexico and North America and for U.

5|$|Kapitän zur See Otto von Diederichs took {{command of}} the ship in 1889. Sachsen {{took part in a}} {{goodwill}} visit to Portsmouth {{to take part in the}} Cowes Regatta. Following the trip to England, Sachsen and the rest of the fleet conducted the annual summer exercises. At 15:45 on 27 February 1890, Sachsen ran aground outside Kiel in foggy weather. The grounding <b>dented</b> the bottom of the hull and tore it open. However, on 2 March, the ship was able to get underway at high tide. Repairs lasted for two weeks. In 1891, the German navy stopped the practice of deactivating the fleet in the winter months and instead kept the front-line units on permanent active duty. The fleet was also reorganized, to form two four-ship divisions. Sachsen and her sisters were assigned to the I Division, under the command of Admiral Hans von Koester. Annual fleet training cruises were conducted in April. The summer fleet maneuvers, which occurred during mid-August to mid-September, up through 1894 were always centered on defensive actions in the North and Baltic seas.|$|E
5|$|The {{most notable}} {{instance}} of Ba Cụt's abandoning {{the fight against}} the Việt Minh came in mid-1953. At that time, his forces had been helping to defend the regional Mekong Delta town of Mỹ Tho, but the French decided to transfer more of the military power to their more mainstream allies, the Vietnamese National Army (VNA). As the French tried to undermine his position, tensions with Ba Cụt increased. On 25 June, the Hòa Hảo leader ordered his men to evacuate their French-supplied bases; they took their weapons with them and razed the camps. Ba Cụt then withdrew his forces from a string of military posts in the Plain of Reeds and retreated to Châu Đốc in the extreme south of the country. As a result, the French-aligned presence in the Mekong Delta was severely <b>dented</b> and the Việt Minh made substantial gains in the area. Eventually, the French defeat at Điện Biên Phủ in May 1954 signaled the end of French Indochina.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{name was}} probably <b>Dent</b> d'Hérens, the actual {{name of the}} nearby <b>Dent</b> d'Hérens which does not overlook the Val d'Hérens. The nearby north face of the <b>Dent</b> d'Hérens is glaciated while the <b>Dent</b> Blanche holds much less snow, it was even called <b>Dent</b> Noire (Black Tooth) on the Woerl Atlas of 1842. In fact on older maps, {{in the area where}} lie both summits, only the name Weisszahnhorn (from German: White Tooth Peak) was indicated, the French name (<b>Dent</b> Blanche) appearing in 1820 only. Because cartographers usually made their observations far away from the mountainous remote areas and also because the <b>Dent</b> d'Hérens is sometime hidden behind the <b>Dent</b> Blanche thus less visible, the latter received the name. The inhabitants of the lower Val d'Hérens called the actual <b>Dent</b> d'Hérens, <b>Dent</b> Blanche, but the ones of the upper Val d'Hérens called the mountain, <b>Dent</b> de Rong or <b>Dent</b> d'Erins, contributing to the general confusion.

40|$|A <b>dent</b> is {{a defect}} in the pipe wall {{in the form of}} {{localized}} inward plastic deformation. <b>Dents</b> are a matter of serious concern for pipeline operators because they may cause a rupture or a leak in the pipeline.

Therefore, this study was undertaken using full-scale tests and a parametric study to assess the influence of various parameters on the strain distributions in a <b>dent.</b> Additionally, the ASME strain-based <b>dent</b> evaluation criterion was reviewed.

5|$|Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky {{was educated}} {{for a career}} as a civil servant. There was scant {{opportunity}} for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that <b>dented</b> Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovsky's career.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of Indonesian {{intelligence}} influential with Suharto {{had initially}} envisaged that invasion, subdual of Fretilin resistance, and integration with Indonesia would be quick and relatively painless. The ensuing Indonesian campaigns up through 1976 were devastating for the East Timorese, an enormous drain on Indonesian resources, were severely damaging to Indonesia internationally, and ultimately a failure. The wanton, wholesale killings by the TNI near the coastal regions {{during the opening}} months of the invasion had driven {{a large portion of}} the population and most of the remaining Falintil into the central regions. This proved counterproductive as it left Indonesian troops fighting against an enemy which was well equipped and had access to agricultural resources and population. The civilian population came to see the Falintil as a buffer against the excesses of the Indonesian forces, which led to heightened support for the resistance. From 1975 to 1977, the Fretilin protected at least 40% of the population who had fled the coastal regions, in inhospitable conditions, with the active support of rallied communities. Schwarz suggests the fact that Indonesian military's power base remained barely <b>dented</b> by the mid-1970s intelligence miscalculations and ongoing failures, was a measure of the military's dominance of Indonesian affairs.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that thin {{cylindrical}} shell structures have wide applications as one of the important structural elements in many engineering fields and its load carrying capacity is decided by its buckling strength which in turn predominantly depends on geometrical imperfections present in it. Geometrical imperfections can be classified as local and distributed geometrical imperfections. But in this work, only local geometrical imperfection namely <b>dent</b> is considered for analysis. The main aim {{of this study is to}} determine the more influential dimensional parameter out of two <b>dent</b> dimensional parameters, one is the extent of <b>dent</b> present over a surface area and the other is <b>dent</b> depth, which affect the buckling strength of the cylindrical shells drastically. To account for the parameter “extent of <b>dent</b> present over an area”, the <b>dent</b> is considered as circular <b>dent</b> and its amplitude is considered as <b>dent</b> depth. For this purpose, finite element (FE) models of cylindrical shells with a circular <b>dent</b> at half the height of cylindrical shells having different <b>dent</b> sizes are generated. These FE models are analyzed using ANSYS non-linear buckling analysis. It is concluded that extent of <b>dent</b> present over an area is more influential than <b>dent</b> depth. To verify this conclusion further, FE models of cylindrical shells with two circular <b>dents</b> at half the height of cylindrical shell placed at 180 ˚ apart having different <b>dent</b> sizes are generated and analyzed...|$|R
