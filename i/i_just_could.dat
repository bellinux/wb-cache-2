Bush's {{reelection in}} 2004, she urged {{her husband to}} run again for President, later saying: [...] "I {{literally}} wore black for a week. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not believe that he won, because I felt that things were already so bad. I was so against the [...] And I said to Joe, 'You've got to change this, {{you have to change}} this.'" [...] During Joe Biden's 2008 campaign to be the Democratic nominee, she continued to teach during the week and would join him for campaigning on weekends. She said that she would have taken an activist role in addressing education as her chief focus of concern as a potential First Lady. She also said that she was basically apolitical and would not seek inclusion in Cabinet meetings.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Rowan Kaiser, {{writing for}} The A.V. Club was very positive towards the episode, writing [...] "'I Am God' {{is probably the}} strangest episode since 'Nobody Puts Baby in a Corner', but unlike that one's somewhat random focus, 'I Am God' is intently pointed at one thing: the bus crash." [...] While wishing that it had come earlier in the season, the reviewer wrote that [...] "its intense style and emotional stakes {{put it on the}} shortlist of best Veronica Mars episodes." [...] Price Peterson of TV.com praised the dream sequences for their beauty, but criticized them for their complexity. [...] "Man, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not get enough of the dream-flashbacks in which Veronica talked to the dead students. So beautiful and well-done. On the other hand, my poor brain is starting {{to have a hard time}} keeping all the facts straight." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to acting in films, Chopra {{is active in}} charity work and supports a number of causes. She walked the ramp at the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week to support the Shabana Azmi Mijwan Welfare Society, an NGO dedicated to empowering girls. Chopra said, [...] "I don't {{want it to be}} just about ramp walk, but I seriously and genuinely feel for what Mijwan and what Manish and Shabanaji are doing. For such an initiative, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not say no. I had {{to be a part of}} it." [...] She also appeared on NDTV's Greenathon, an initiative to support eco-friendliness and investigate poor electricity supplies in rural villages, to lend her support. Apart from charity work, she serves as an ambassador for a number of brands. Chopra endorses brands such as Kurkure, Nivea, Maaza and Spinz, WeChat, Pantene and Mahindra scooty. She became the first Bollywood star to endorse products from both Coke (Maaza) and PepsiCo (Kurkure) at the same time.|$|E

500|$|How to Grow a Woman {{from the}} Ground takes {{influence}} from different genres, “drawing equally from traditional bluegrass, progressive acoustic, and singer/songwriter traditions”, with one critic calling {{the majority of}} the album very “roots oriented”. The album has a bluegrass or progressive bluegrass core; bluegrass mandolinist Ronnie McCoury became the album’s official “bluegrass guru” to ensure that there was “someone who could make sure we didn’t do anything clichéd or trite”. In regard to [...] the album’s style, Thile said that “All in all, How to Grow a Woman from the Ground is a bluegrass record. There are definitely some musical things that are out of the ordinary, but it sounds like a bluegrass record to me. It’s not all like “Brakeman’s Blues,” but “Brakeman’s Blues” doesn’t sound out of place, and neither does “The Beekeeper” sound out of place. It’s all related.” Much of Thile's work on the album was influenced by his divorce, and Thile claims that he could relate to the title of the album, a Tom Brosseau song. Thile said that he [...] "got my ass kicked by the last relationship I was in. This girl just left. It created a pretty serious complex for me. [...] I’ve always been able to talk to girls, but I’m scared of them. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> relate to it. Like, man if I could just grow one, that would take care of a lot of problems." ...|$|E

Upon reviewing Washburn's draft, Cimino said, [...] "I came back, and read it and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not believe what I read. It was like {{it was written by}} somebody who was... mentally deranged." [...] Cimino confronted Washburn at the Sunset Marquis in LA about the draft, and Washburn supposedly replied that he couldn't take the pressure and had to go home. Cimino then fired Washburn. Cimino later claimed to have written the entire screenplay himself. Washburn's response to Cimino's comments were, [...] "It's all nonsense. It's lies. I didn't have a single drink the entire time I was working on the script." ...|$|E

60|$|But when I {{thought of}} her <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not see failure. Something must be done, but what? I {{was at the end}} of my wits. When Jersey City beat us that Saturday, eleven to two, shoving us down to fifth place with only a few {{percentage}} points above the Fall River team, I grew desperate, and locking my players in the dressing room I went after them. They had lain down on me and needed a jar. I told them so straight and flat, and being bitter, I did not pick and choose my words.|$|E

And then, {{when it came to the}} real thing, I found <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not stand it. I know it's silly of me.

6000|$|... "My God!" [...] I ejaculated. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> {{not help}} it. I felt Sally's small fingers {{clutching}} my arm like sharp pincers. I bit my lips {{to keep them}} shut. What if Steele had heard her say that? Poor, noble, justice-loving, blind girl! She knew even less than I hoped. I forced my thought to the question immediately at hand. She gloried in the Ranger's work. She wanted with all her heart to see him succeed in it. She had a woman's pride in his manliness. Perhaps, with a woman's complex, incomprehensible motive, she wanted Steele to be shown to her in all the power that made him hated and feared by lawless men. She had finally accepted the wild life of this border as something terrible and inevitable, but passing. Steele {{was one of the}} strange and great and misunderstood men who were making that wild life pass.|$|E
