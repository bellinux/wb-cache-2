2500|$|The {{old stone}} work may only need {{cleaning}} or sandblasting, {{but it may}} need more. [...] Firstly, the building exterior (facade) needs to be inspected for unsafe conditions. [...] Next, the building walls need to be inspected for water leakages. [...] The most likely needs are mortar restoration (repointing), applying consolidants to the old stone, or replacing pieces of stone that are deteriorated (damaged) beyond the point of any repair. The repointing is the removal of existing damaged mortar from the outer portion of the joint between stone units and its replacement by new mortar matching {{the appearance of the}} old. [...] The consolidants re-establish the original natural bonding between the stone particles that weathering has removed. [...] Deteriorated pieces of stone work are replaced with pieces of stone that match the original as much as possible. Exterior dimension stone will often change color after <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> over time. For example, Indiana Limestone will weather from a tan to an attractive light yellow. Interior dimension stone can sometimes change its shade a little over time too. For both, it may not be possible to find an exact match, even from the original quarry. [...] Stone will often change its appearance from location to location in the same quarry. [...] If the dimension stone renovationist is truly fortunate, the original builder put aside some spare pieces of the stone for future need.|$|E

While marine terraces in areas of relatively rapid uplift rates (> 1 mm/year) can often be correlated to individual interglacial periods or stages, those in areas of slower uplift rates may have a polycyclic origin with stages of returning sea levels following periods of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering.</b>|$|R
60|$|Moving {{the lamp}} {{as the man}} moved, I made {{out that he was}} {{substantially}} dressed, but roughly, like a voyager by sea. That he had long iron-gray hair. That his age was about sixty. That he was a muscular man, strong on his legs, and that he was browned and hardened by <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather.</b> As he ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp included us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he was holding out both his hands to me.|$|E
60|$|Anyone who {{had stood}} by now would have pitied her, {{not so much}} on account of her <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather,</b> and {{isolation}} from all of humanity except the mouldered remains inside the tumulus; but for that other form of misery which was denoted by the slightly rocking movement that her feelings imparted to her person. Extreme unhappiness weighed visibly upon her. Between the drippings of the rain from her umbrella to her mantle, from her mantle to the heather, from the heather to the earth, very similar sounds could be heard coming from her lips; and the tearfulness of the outer scene was repeated upon her face. The wings of her soul were broken by the cruel obstructiveness of all about her; and even had she seen herself in a promising way of getting to Budmouth, entering a steamer, and sailing to some opposite port, she would have been but little more buoyant, so fearfully malignant were other things. She uttered words aloud. When a woman in such a situation, neither old, deaf, crazed, nor whimsical, takes upon herself to sob and soliloquize aloud there is something grievous the matter.|$|E
60|$|Emboldened {{by these}} considerations, the Jew pursued his point, and jostled the Norman Christian, without respect either to his descent, quality, or religion. The {{complaints}} {{of the old}} man, however, excited the indignation of the bystanders. One of these, a stout well-set yeoman, arrayed in Lincoln green, having twelve arrows stuck in his belt, with a baldric and badge of silver, and a bow of six feet length in his hand, turned short round, and while his countenance, which his constant <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> had rendered brown as a hazel nut, grew darker with anger, he advised the Jew to remember that all the wealth he had acquired by sucking the blood of his miserable victims had but swelled him like a bloated spider, which might be overlooked while he kept in a comer, but would be crushed if it ventured into the light. This intimation, delivered in Norman-English with a firm voice and a stern aspect, made the Jew shrink back; {{and he would have}} probably withdrawn himself altogether from a vicinity so dangerous, had not the attention of every one been called to the sudden entrance of Prince John, who at that moment entered the lists, attended by a numerous and gay train, consisting partly of laymen, partly of churchmen, as light in their dress, and as gay in their demeanour, as their companions. Among the latter was the Prior of Jorvaulx, in the most gallant trim which a dignitary of the church could venture to exhibit. Fur and gold were not spared in his garments; and the points of his boots, out-heroding the preposterous fashion of the time, turned up so very far, as to be attached, not to his knees merely, but to his very girdle, and effectually prevented him from putting his foot into the stirrup. This, however, was a slight inconvenience to the gallant Abbot, who, perhaps, even rejoicing in the opportunity to display his accomplished horsemanship before so many spectators, especially of the fair sex, dispensed with the use of these supports to a timid rider. The rest of Prince John's retinue consisted of the favourite leaders of his mercenary troops, some marauding barons and profligate attendants upon the court, with several Knights Templars and Knights of St John.|$|E

50|$|The eastern Adriatic shore's Croatian part is {{the most}} {{indented}} Mediterranean coastline. Most of the eastern coast is characterised by a karst topography, developed from the Adriatic Carbonate Platform's <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>weathering.</b> Karstification there largely began after the Dinarides' final uplift in the Oligocene and the Miocene, when carbonate deposits were exposed to atmospheric effects; this extended {{to the level of}} 120 m below the present sea level, exposed during the Last Glacial Maximum. It is estimated that some karst formations are from earlier sea level drops, most notably the Messinian salinity crisis. Similarly, karst developed in Apulia from the Apulian Carbonate Platform.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{galvanizing}} will inhibit {{attack of}} the underlying steel, rusting will be inevitable after some decades of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather,</b> especially if exposed to acidic conditions. For example, corrugated iron sheet roofing will start to degrade {{within a few years}} despite the protective action of the zinc coating. Marine and salty environments also lower the lifetime of galvanized iron because the high electrical conductivity of sea water increases the rate of corrosion, primarily through converting the solid zinc to soluble zinc chloride which simply washes away. Galvanized car frames exemplify this; they corrode much faster in cold environments due to road salt, though they will last longer than unprotected steel.|$|E
50|$|Nozzles are {{attached}} to the pump via flexible hoses, allowing them to be placed into the vehicle's filling inlet. The hoses are robust to survive heavy wear and tear, including <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>weather</b> and being driven over, and are often attached using heavy spring or coil arrangements to provide additional strength. A breakaway valve is also fitted to the hose to allow the nozzle and hose to break off and fuel flow to be stopped in the case a vehicle drives off with the nozzle still in the filler, although this is largely prevented today by the point-of-sale systems not allowing payment for fuel until the nozzle is returned to its petrol pump holder.|$|E
